3,1,2011-01-07,Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado.," Madam  Speaker, today our national debt  is  $14.01 trillion. It rolled over to above  $14 trillion for the first time on New  Year’s Eve last week. On January 6,  2009, the start of the 111th Congress,  the national debt was at $10.63 trillion.  This means the national debt has increased by $3.38 trillion since then—in  just 2 short years. This debt and its interest payments we are passing to our  children and to all future Americans.  I have been submitting, and will continue to submit, this debt to the CONGRESSIONALRECORD daily, and I will  continue to do so until Washington  takes responsibility and ends its reckless spending addiction.  f  SEND YOUR RESUMES  (Mr. JACKSON of Illinois asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",2011
4,1,2011-01-07,Mr. JACKSON of  Illinois.," Madam  Speaker, as we enter 2011, we find ourselves in the same jobs situation as in  2010. In order to show the huge need for  jobs, I will be collecting resumes from  Americans who are unemployed or underemployed. I’ll submit them for the  CONGRESSIONALRECORD. Unfortunately,  submitting  these  resumes  for  the  RECORDwill not get anybody a job.  By collecting these resumes, I hope  to dramatize the shameful condition of  unemployment and compel Congress to  do something about it. I hope to remind my colleagues every day that we  work  for those Americans who have  been left behind but who want to work.  Today, I call on my fellow Americans  to send me your resume and your story  to resumesforAmerica@mail.house.gov.  ResumesforAmerica@mail.house.gov. If  you are out of work, send me your resume and story so that I can use it to  remind our government of the need to  act.  Martin Luther King, Jr. once said:  America has issued us a bad check. It  has come back marked  ‘‘insufficient  funds.’’ But the vault of opportunity of  this Nation is not bankrupt.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

7,8,2011-01-07,Mr. LEVIN.," This is what the Republicans  are  after, what  their  repeal  would mean: It would take away from  millions  of Americans  coverage  for  kids with preexisting conditions, coverage for young adults under 26. Recommended preventive care would be  taken away. It would take away lower  drug costs for seniors. And this is what  the Republican  repeal would do.  It  would give back to insurance companies unreasonable premium increases,  unjust policy terminations, rescisions.  It would take away this. It would give  back profits and CEO salaries to insurance companies, not health care benefits.  b 1000  It would give back annual and lifetime limits on benefits. It gives back  to insurance companies discrimination  ability against women.  These are concrete reasons to vote  ‘‘no’’ on this repeal, a misfortune for  the United States of America.  ",2011
8,8,2011-01-07,Mr. DREIER.," Madam Speaker, at  this time I yield 2 minutes to another  hardworking member of  the Energy  and Commerce Committee, our friend  from Marietta, Georgia, Dr. GINGREY.  ",2011
9,8,2011-01-07,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot  of arguments on the other side of the  aisle in regard to the $230 billion cost,  and on our side of the aisle, of course,  only in America can something actually cost $1.15 trillion and eliminating  it then all of a sudden costs $230 billion. But, yes, Ms. SLAUGHTER, only in  America, only in this Congress, numbers do lie.  Let me just say that what we have  been talking about on this side of the  aisle, of course,  is the voice of the  American people.  You know, it was about 3,000 years  ago that a little shepherd boy walked  into that valley of death looking up at  all of those Philistines and that 9-foot  giant Goliath from Gath. He had that  coat of mail, he had the sword, he had  the shield, he had the  javelin. And  what did little David have? He had a  little pouch and a handful of stones.  But he hit that giant right between the  eyes, brought him to his knees, and  then cut off the head of the snake.  That pouch and those little pebbles  represent the voice of the American  people. That is what we have on this  side of the aisle. That is why we are  going to pass H. Res. 9 and we are going  to pass H.R. 2 next week, and we are  going to deliver our promise to the  American people to eliminate, to repeal ObamaCare.  The American people spoke loudly.  They don’t like this bill. The Democratic majority in the Senate and the  President have  one  last  chance  to  make amends. I think they will do it.  ",2011
10,8,2011-01-07,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Madam Speaker, I  yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. MARKEY).  ",2011
11,8,2011-01-07,Mr. MARKEY.," This debate is about  health care versus don’t care.  The Democrats’ health care law lowers prescription drug costs, helps middle class families pay for health coverage for their sick children, and expands health care for 32 million more  Americans, reducing the deficit by $143  billion. The Democrats’ health care law  helps grandma afford her prescription  drugs.  The Republicans don’t care about  grandma. They want to take back the  drug benefits in the new law. GOP used  to stand for Grand Old Party; now it  stands for ‘‘grandma’s out of prescriptions.’’ The Republicans’ ‘‘don’t care’’  repeal shows they don’t care about sick  children with medical bills pushing  families  into bankruptcy,  that  they  don’t care about grandma and grandpa  who need help paying for prescription  drugs.  Vote down this rule so that we can  help grandma, sick children, and middle class families struggling to pay for  health care.  ",2011
12,8,2011-01-07,Mr. DREIER.," Madam Speaker, at  this point I am happy to yield 1 minute  to another hardworking member of this  freshman class, my new  friend  from  San Antonio, Texas (Mr. CANSECO).  ",2011
13,8,2011-01-07,Mr. CANSECO.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise today in support of the rule and in  support of the underlying legislation,  the repealing of the job-killing health  care act.  Ten months ago, President Obama  and his allies  in the Democrat-controlled House and Senate committed  legislative malpractice  when  they  jammed through the Congress and into  law a Washington takeover of health  care. They did so despite the overwhelming opposition of the American  people. Since its enactment into law,  what was already a unpopular law has  only continued to become more unpopular.  There is no doubt that we need to reform health care in America. However,  it is not done by assaulting individual  liberties guaranteed in our Constitution,  bankrupting  our  children  and  grandchildren, and putting Washington  bureaucrats in the personal relationships between our doctors and our patients.  Repealing the health care bill will  also help encourage job growth to get  our economy back on track. Our economy is not suffering from a capital crisis; it is suffering from a confidence  crisis.

16,8,2011-01-07,Mr. CANSECO.," Policies enacted  in  Washington, like the health care bill,  have  injected  uncertainty  into  our  economy  that has  eroded  the  confidence of Americans to start new businesses or expand current ones to create  jobs.  The American people have made it  clear they want the health care law repealed and replaced with commonsense  alternatives that will lower the cost of  health care while also increasing quality  and  access. After meeting  and  speaking with thousands of Texans in  the 23rd District over the past year,  this is their message.  Repealing and replacing the health  care bill is one of the promises made to  the American people in the Pledge to  America. Today, we are making good  on that promise as we begin the work  of repealing the health care law and replacing it to ensure that the American  people can get the health care that  they need, when they need it, and at a  price they can afford—without the Federal Government coming between them  and their doctor.  I support the rule.  ",2011
17,8,2011-01-07,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Madam Speaker, I  yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE).  ",2011
18,8,2011-01-07,Mr. PALLONE.," Madam Speaker, this  is nothing but a gag rule. I and so  many of my colleagues on the Democratic side went up to the Rules Committee yesterday and asked for amendments, and they were almost all excluded from this rule.  The Republican chairman of the committee says there is transparency. He  says that there is an opportunity for  participation. He can say it as many  times as he wants, but it is simply not  true.  He also said that this was a commitment to the American people. There is  no commitment to the American people here. The only commitment is to  the insurance companies. They are the  only ones that are going to gain from  repeal of this very important legislation, because they want to  increase  premiums, and they want to institute  discriminatory practices again against  women, a woman perhaps who has  breast cancer and a preexisting condition and can’t get insurance, or bring  back those lifetime caps, or bring back  those annual caps where people  lose  their insurance if they have had a serious operation and they try to go back  again and they don’t have insurance, or  perhaps the child who is up to 26 and  who also will not be able to get on  their parents’ insurance policy again.  Let me tell you here, the only one  who benefits is the insurance company,  not the American people.

22,15,2011-01-07,Mr. WEINER.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  I  thought  that  the chairman was  going to say that he was going to be  brief. Well, he had no choice with this  rule. It’s a pretty short one.  I just want to say in the brief 2 minutes that we have here that this is a  pretty  important  issue  that we are  faced with. And I should say just at the  outset that I have the greatest respect  for my friend, ",2011
23,15,2011-01-07,Mr. SESSIONS.," I consider  him to be a friend. I hope to get to  know Mr. FITZPATRICKas well and to  call him a friend as well. But what we  are dealing with today is perhaps the  most basic test that we have of whether we’re going to take legislation seriously.  To the great credit of the maker of  this resolution, which we just got, it  stipulates right in the first couple of  sections, we violated the Constitution  on our very first day. The constitutional requirement for oath was violated. And I give you great credit for  recognizing that in the resolution.  Now you do say that it created nullities, which is, frankly, a way of saying we operated outside this document  on the same day we were reading it.  When  Mr.  and  Mr.  FITZPATRICKstood up in front of a television set and held their right hand  up—not unlike about 2,000 of my constituents,  I  suspect—they were violating a very important part of these  proceedings, and yet we have a grand  total of 2 minutes on each side, Mr.  DREIER, and to my colleagues, in which  to debate how to fix that infirmity.  Mr. SESSIONSpresided over the Rules  Committee during a large portion in  which he was not even a duly sworn  Member of the United States Congress.  Yet we are doing nothing to go back  and see would that participation influence proceedings at all.  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote  against  this  resolution, not because  Mr. FITZPATRICKand Mr. SESSIONSare  not Members of Congress, they clearly  are and I congratulate them, but because for the first time in American  history, the first time in the history of  this body, we are going to pass a fix of  a constitutional infirmity with—wait  for it—4 minutes of debate when we  didn’t have the bill until just now. I  strongly urge my colleagues to think  about the precedent this sets.  SESSIONS I ask the consent of the chairman for  an additional 1 minute so we can have  an understanding.  ",2011

40,22,2011-01-07,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, history,  heritage  and  symbols  of  the  United States are  constantly under  criticism in this country. Even yesterday when we read the Constitution of  the United States on the House floor,  the first time it has ever been done in  200 years, there were some who complained that it is irrelevant. It is kind  of like folks in church that cover their  ears when certain sections of the Bible  are read. They don’t want to hear it because it may apply to them.  People go to court nowadays to try  to remove our national motto, In God  We Trust. It  is above the  flag, Mr.  Speaker, although television very seldom shows our national motto.  Then there are those who are offended  by  the American  flag, Old  Glory. It is not even displayed in parts  of the United States because it offends  some people. Some people that are included in the group are foreigners who  are offended by the American flag.  Now we get to today, a report by the  Houston Chronicle about Marine Michael Merola, a 60-year-old vet from  the United States Marine Corps, and he  flies, here he is, he still looks like a  Marine, this is a photograph from the  Chronicle that shows Old Glory and, of  course, the Marine flag, flying in his  backyard on a 20-foot flagpole.  No one has complained. His neighbors  like it. Kids walk by and actually compliment him on flying Old Glory and  the Marine flag. But the neighborhood  association has complained and sued.  Now, who is this guy? Well, he served  in the United States Marines from 1969  to 1977. He trained with the United  States Navy SEALs. After he left the  Marine Corps, he was responsible as  sergeant of the guard for raising the  flag at NSA right down the road. He is  from New York, but he got to Texas as  fast as he could, and he has no intention of taking down this flag or flagpole. He is a passionate American. He  is a marine.  But the association doesn’t like it,  and here  is what they have said  in  their  lawsuit: the  flagpole  is a detriment to the association. It causes imminent harm and irreparable injury to  the association. The problem with the  flagpole of that height and that significance is it flaps in the wind and causes  noise to other homeowners. That  is  their problem. So they sued him.  Now, first of all, we have an issue of  freedom of speech. The Supreme Court  has said it is a right to fly the flag.  Speech includes the flying of the American flag. It is the symbol of everything that  is good and right about  America. That is why it is behind you,  Mr. Speaker, when we go into session  every day.  Marines and sailors and soldiers and  members  of  the Coast Guard have  fought under that  flag all over the  world and have died for that flag so the  association can exist down there  in  northwest Houston. Right now we are  engaged in two wars, in Afghanistan  and Iraq, and members of our military  are fighting under that flag. But it is  flying in the breeze and offends the association because the flapping causes  irreparable injury.  Well,  flapping  in  the  breeze  has  brought safety to the United States.  The flag flying throughout the world  and the noise, if we can use that word,  the sound of freedom, is the sound of  that flag flying in the United States  and throughout the world. It is freedom of speech, and it trumps the elitist  concept that the flag and the flagpole  are offensive to the association.  You know, Mr. Merola is a marine.  Once a marine, always a marine. And  we are proud of our marines in the  United States. They  are  a  unique  bunch. That was best said by an Army  general about the Marines, ‘‘There are  only two groups that understand the  marines—the marines, and the enemy.’’  And that is correct.  So good for you, Mike Merola. Keep  your flagpole up. Fly Old Glory. Fly  the marine flag. We are proud of you.  Keep fighting for the flag, because freedom of flying the flag trumps the concept that it is offensive to some people.  God bless our marines, God bless you,  Mike Merola, and semper fi.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  ",2011

44,22,2011-01-07,Mr. KING of Iowa.," Thank you, Mr.  Speaker. I very much appreciate the  privilege to address you here on the  floor of the House in this leadership  hour designated by the majority leader.  There are a number of subjects  I  wanted to take up this afternoon, but I  am  first  inspired by  the  statement  made by the gentleman  from Texas,  Judge, Congressman, Mr. POE, about  Marine Mike Merola.  This is one of these recurring stories  that we hear across the country. Somebody that is an ACLU individual, somebody that thinks somehow they get indignant because  there  is  something  somewhere that would allow them to  vent  some  of  their  prepackaged  hyperventilation against patriotism or  the truth or life or the Constitution or  the Declaration of  Independence or  American values or the values of Western Civilization or Judeo-Christianity,  all those people out there are full of indignities.  So an American flag and a marine  flag offends somebody? I say tough. I  am glad you are there. Fly that flag.  Fly it proud and fly it long.  I especially appreciate the statement  made by Mr. POEabout the sound of  that flag. My flag is on a flagpole about  that same height, 20 foot. I step out my  door in the morning, I check the wind  and the weather and I look at that flag,  and I listen to that sound. And there is  times I am sitting there in the dark at  night on my deck and I am hearing  that flag from the light that shines on  it around the corner just a little bit,  and I hear that ripple of Old Glory. It  gives me comfort and it gives me pride,  and it reminds me of the privilege of  serving here, anywhere you can serve  Americans anywhere on this globe.  I think of a time also on March 18,  2003, where I went out here to Pershing  Park, this side of the White House,  when there was an antiwar demonstration that took place. I actually walked  around through the Mall, around the  Washington Monument as  they prepared their demonstration. I remember  former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, John Conyers, standing on a  little stage there with great big speakers calling  for  the  impeachment of  President Bush because it looked like  there was an impending liberation of  Iraq. And I saw a man there.  Every kind of discontented, counter-  cultural, anti-American group was represented in those thousands of people  that came here that day. I saw the Japanese communist flag. I saw Vegetarians for Peace. I saw every counter-  culturalist group you can imagine. And  I saw a man there, an aging hippie. He  had on a  jacket. He was a photographer, you could tell, and he was taking pictures with great pride of this  anti-Americanism.  He reached in his pocket of his jacket, a worn leather jacket, and pulled  out of his pocket a flag, an American  flag, a silk American flag, a small flag,  and he used it to wipe the lens of his  camera. That is an image I will never  forget.  But no one stepped up to say he  couldn’t do  that. Where were  they  then? Where were the critics of Mr.  Merola then? When flags are used as  grease rags to scrub the lens of a camera that  is taking pictures of anti-  Americans joined together to protest  the saving of our freedom that Marine  Merola has stepped up to defend.  Those actions against him are offensive to me, and I say guard the flag, defend the flag, and I will stand with you,  and I know Judge POEwill too.

47,36,2011-01-07,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to honor the life of a great American, Katherine C. Kelly, a lifelong champion  of human  rights and universal health care,  who died on the morning of January 6, 2011  at the age of 86.  Katherine was a good friend and supporter  for more than 40 years. Over the course of  her life, she and her late husband, Edward M.  Kelly, were prominently active in the civil rights  movement, the fight for women’s rights, gay  rights, and every progressive movement in the  United States. Katherine dedicated her life to  the Democratic Party, serving as State Committeewoman from Palm Beach County for 26  years.  Additionally, she was named to the Electoral  College and served as a delegate  to  five  Democratic National Conventions.  She also served as the Legislative Director  for Florida NOW, as Vice President of  the  Florida Women’s Political Caucus, as a Board  member for NARAL, and as Development Director of Women Leaders Online. Her continued dedication  to political and progressive  causes led to recognition as the Outstanding  Feminist 2001 by Florida NOW and Woman of  the Year in 2008 by the Democratic Women’s  Club Palm Beach County.  Mr. Speaker, Katherine was deeply  loved  and widely respected by everyone who knew  her. Today, our nation has lost someone who  represented all that is good in the world.  f  IN  RECOGNITION  OF  THE  PANPAPHIAN  ASSOCIATION  OF  AMERICA ON THE OCCASION OF  ITS ANNUAL DINNER-DANCE  HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 7, 2011  ",2011
48,36,2011-01-07,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to the PanPaphian Association  of America for its tremendous contributions to  our cultural and civic life. Founded more than  two decades ago by Hellenic Cypriot Americans of Paphian ancestry, the Association has  carried out its vital educational, cultural, charitable, and humanitarian mission while helping  promote peace, unity, and understanding on  the occupied island of Cyprus.  The PanPaphian Association of America  held the Ninth Evagoras Pallikarides Award of  Merit dinner-dance last month. The Evagoras  Pallikarides Award of Merit was bestowed  upon Mr. Alkinoos Ioannidis for his dedication  to promoting Hellenic culture  through music  and song. Born and raised in Nicosia, Cyprus,  Mr.  Ioannidis studied classical guitar at  the  European Conservatory, moved  to Athens,  and was signed by Universal Music at age 23.  He went on to pursue a successful career in  acting and music, eventually focusing his efforts as a thriving musical performer and composer with many successful recordings. Influenced by traditional Cypriot music, the Greek  composers of the last decades, and classical,  jazz and rock genres. He often performs with  orchestras and ensembles. Above all, he remains devoted to the Cypriot people, their culture, and their struggle for justice, donating his  time and talent to numerous concerts and performances benefitting various Hellenic organizations and causes associated with justice for  Cyprus.  The PanPaphian Association awarded  the  Distinguished Fellow Cypriot Award  to Mr.  Polys Kyriacou, a distinguished poet and lyricist who has distinguished himself in his passionate commitment to justice for Cyprus and  his love for Hellenic culture. Born in Nicosia,  he served in the Cyprus National Guard before his studies at Pantios University in Athens. He came to New York City in 1982 to  earn a Master’s Degree in Communication and  Graphic Design at the Pratt Institute and then  worked as an Art Director at the Proini daily  newspaper. He served for many years on the  board of  the Cyprus Federation of America  and  the Justice  for Cyprus Committee, published  two  volumes  of  poetry,  including  Sximata, which won First Prize for a Young  Poet from the Cyprus Ministry of Education. A  Member of the Board of Directors of Cosmos  FM Radio, he hosts his own program every  Sunday morning and remains deeply involved  in New York City’s vibrant Hellenic community.  The Member of the Year Award was given  to Mr. George Kouspos. Born and raised  in  Paphos on Cyprus, he came  to  the United  States in 1984 after serving as an officer in  the Cyprus National Guard. He earned a  Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering  from  the City College of New York  and an M.B.A. degree from Adelphi University  while working his way through school. He became  a  principal  at  CY  Electric  Corp.  Throughout his studies and his subsequent  professional success, he has  remained extraordinarily devoted to the cause of justice for  Cyprus; to the PanPaphian Association, which  he has served as Vice President, Cultural Officer, and Treasurer; and above all to his beloved family, Nancy (Nafsika), who was born  in Asgata, Cyprus, and his beautiful daughters, Demetra and Maria.  Mr. Speaker,  I ask  that my distinguished  colleagues rise to join me in paying tribute to  the PanPaphian Association of America,  the  recipients of its awards, and all its many contributions to the civic life of our Nation.  f  TRIBUTE  TO  CLARK  SHERIFF’S  DEPUTY  WAUGHTEL HOPPER  COUNTY  SUZANNE  HON.

49,36,2011-01-07,Mr. AUSTRIA.," Mr. Speaker, today I will be  traveling back  to Ohio  to express my sympathy to the family of Clark County Sheriff’s  Deputy Suzanne Waughtel Hopper. Deputy  Hopper’s funeral will be at 11:00 a.m. on Friday, January 7, 2011.  Deputy Hopper was killed in the line of duty  on New Year’s Day while responding to shots  fired in a local community. Because of her decisive action, courage and bravery lives were  saved. She is a true American hero.  f  IMAN ABBASI  HON.

50,36,2011-01-07,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, in just a  few days, on January 9, Iraqi authorities will  deport  the Abbasi  family  to  Iran where  they  face certain persecution.  The Abbasis are political refugees. Their father got in trouble in Iran because he dared to  write that Iranians actually deserve freedom.  He wrote that every man should be able to  have a say in who governs them. This simple  idea is the very foundation on which our great  Nation was built and  the  fundamental, universal human right of all mankind. But the tiny  tyrant of  Iran did not  like  that. He saw Mr.  Abbasi as a threat to his power.  The regime, having tasted power, is doing  whatever it can to keep it. That includes imprisoning,  torturing, and murdering anyone  who so dares speak against it. But these are  desperate actions  from a desperate regime.

51,2,2011-01-18,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  today we begin debate on the Republicans’ unfortunate  effort  to  repeal  health care reform. I pray that this debate today is civil and that it is respectful.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, and many  of our colleagues know, I served as a  judge in my State for many years. I understand what it means to be objective  and to have a fair debate. And I know  there are usually two sides to every  issue. But when it comes to repealing  the  reforms  that  Democrats  have  passed, I just can’t figure it out.  Why would Republicans add $230 billion to the deficit when their mantra  has been deficit reduction? Why would  Republicans force small businesses to  pay higher  taxes after  fighting  for  cuts? Why would Republicans  take  away a parent’s right to cover their  adult children? And why in the world  would Republicans make seniors pay  more  for their prescription drugs? I  just don’t understand. It appears to me  that this may be partisan politics.  f  ATTACK IN TUCSON  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2011
52,2,2011-01-18,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, it is  the shooter, not the gun. Not the bullets; not rejection by the Army; not  the Internet; not radio talk shows; not  the political climate; not people assembling to protest; not the press; and not  bold speech that is to blame for the  crimes by the terror from Tucson. Hold  the assassin accountable. He and he  alone should be judged. In this frenzied  furor to make excuses and to find other  causes for the crime, Congress itself  would  do well not  to  do  violence  against our Constitution.  Those elites, even those in Congress,  who think that they and they alone are  now  authorized  to  regulate  speech,  press, assembly, and the right to bear  arms should understand they cannot  use this assault and murder as an excuse to steal away the rights of citizens, all under the  false  illusion of  making us safe from killers.  The Constitution should not be imprisoned, for it is the terror of Tucson  who should be locked in chains.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  DO NOT REPEAL HEALTH CARE  REFORM  (Mrs. CHRISTENSEN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2011
53,2,2011-01-18,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," Mr. Speaker,  there will be no repeal of the health  care reform law, so let’s be clear. The  agenda that the Republican leadership  has set for this week’s floor activity  and the committee work that follows is  nothing more than an opportunity to  bad talk and fuel the misinformation  about the Affordable Care Act which is  a good law that will help over 30 million people be healthier, create millions of jobs, make our country more  productive and stronger, and reduce  the deficit.  So I am urging all of my colleagues,  but especially those on the other side  of the aisle, in the name of collegiality  and honesty with the public we serve,  to drop the charade and let us use the  time the people of this country have  hired us for to work together to create  more jobs and make sure the health  care law is implemented properly, to  save the homes of families, and to create an educational system that will  once again make our children the first  in the world.  f  b1410  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2011

Res. 2)  authorizing the use of the rotunda of  the Capitol for an event marking the  50th anniversary of the inaugural address of President John F. Kennedy.  The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.  The text of the concurrent resolution  is as follows:  S. CON. RES. 2  Whereas John Fitzgerald Kennedy was  elected to the United States House of Representatives and served from January 3, 1947,  to January 3, 1953, until he was elected by  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to the  Senate where he served from January 3, 1953,  to December 22, 1960;  Whereas on November 8, 1960, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was  elected as  the  35th  President of the United States; and  Whereas on January  20,  1961, President  Kennedy was sworn in as President of the  United States and delivered his inaugural address at 12:51pm, a speech that served as a  clarion call to service for the Nation: Now,  therefore, be it  Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring),  SECTION 1. USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL  FOR  AN  EVENT HONORING  PRESIDENT KENNEDY.  The rotunda of the United States Capitol is  authorized to be used on January 20, 2011, for  a ceremony in honor of the 50th anniversary  of the inaugural address of President John F.  Kennedy. Physical preparations for the conduct of the ceremony shall be carried out in  accordance with such conditions as may be  prescribed by the Architect of the Capitol.  ",2011

60,9,2011-01-18,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield 90 seconds to the gentleman  from Oklahoma  (Mr. COLE),  a new  member of the Budget Committee.  ",2011
61,9,2011-01-18,Mr. COLE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 2, the repeal of last year’s so-  called health bill. The American people, quite  frankly, have never  liked  this bill, as they demonstrated last November. You can’t find a poll where it  cracked 50 percent  in approval. And  those wanting to repeal it have generally always been above that mark.  The bill  itself may be unconstitutional. Over 20 States are now challenging it in Federal court. It is certainly  likely to be unworkable. The  creation of dozens of boards, agencies,  and commissions with rulemaking authority, the fact that hundreds of companies have already asked for waivers  under  the  legislation,  suggest  it  is  going to be a bureaucratic nightmare.  b1530  Finally and most  importantly, the  bill itself is fiscally irresponsible and  unsustainable. The idea that we would  take hundreds of billions of dollars out  of Medicaid and Social Security and  Medicare at a  time when  the baby  boomer generation is beginning to retire is simply irresponsible. I am all for  saving money in Medicare, but when  we do, those savings are going to be  needed to sustain Medicare.  So I urge this House to take the fiscally  responsible  course—repeal  this  bill and start over, and give the American people the health care bill they  deserve and the health care bill they  can afford.  ",2011
62,9,2011-01-18,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from  Florida  (Ms.  WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ).  ",2011
63,9,2011-01-18,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise to oppose the Republican majority’s callous attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Reform  has already made a dramatically positive difference for millions of our constituents and small businesses while  tackling our ballooning national debt.  We in Congress must continue doing  all that we can to support American  families and businesses as we emerge  from this recession. Democrats have  pledged to measure all legislation by a  proposal’s success at creating jobs, at  strengthening the middle class, and at  bringing down  the deficit. Unfortunately, the Republican majority’s attempts to repeal the Affordable Care  Act fails on all such counts.  Repeal would hurt small businesses,  canceling $40 billion worth of tax credits to help employees afford coverage.  Repeal would stall middle class  job  growth, as one-third of small business  owners told the small business majority they were more likely to hire new  employees as a result of reform. And of  course repeal would deepen our already  exploding deficit, increasing it by $230  billion in the next 10 years and by more  than $1 trillion in the following decade.  Many of my colleagues across the  aisle have rebuffed this analysis from  Congress’ own budgetary referee, the  Congressional Budget Office, because it  doesn’t fit the Republican narrative or  campaign promise to tackle the deficit.  However, while they may be entitled to  their own opinions, they are not entitled to their own facts.  Health care repeal is the epitome of  fiscal irresponsibility, and it counters  our most basic American values: life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  We lose life when insurance companies  can freely drop those who are sick from  coverage. We lose liberty when our seniors have to choose between medications and groceries. And we lose the  pursuit of happiness if we return to the  days when only job security guaranteed health security.  Our  fiscal decisions, Mr. Speaker,  must be a reflection not only of our  economic future but of the statement  of our most central national values. By  ensuring  that Americans have vital  coverage rather than cruelly denying it  to them, we can live up to the dreams  of liberty and justice for all.  ",2011
64,9,2011-01-18,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. HUELSKAMP), a member of  the Budget Committee.  ",2011
65,9,2011-01-18,Mr. HUELSKAMP.," Mr. Speaker, as a  result of this  law, employers across  America have discovered that onerous  reporting requirements will force them  to file 1099 forms for every vendor with  which they do $600 worth of business.  This past weekend, I visited with an  accountant  in my district who  indicated he would have to expand his staff  by 25 percent to accommodate all the  extra redtape and paperwork.  Mr. Speaker, this is not the type of  job creation American envisioned.  Additionally,  businesses  and  labor  unions  alike  have  realized  that  ObamaCare is a bad deal, and at least  222 have sought waivers from having to  comply with the law. HHS Secretary  Kathleen Sebelius has approved special  privilege  exemptions  for  dozens  of  labor unions and the half a million  union members they cover. Even more  troubling  is that Secretary Sebelius  has been tardy in responding to a FOIA  inquiry regarding the secretive details  of these waiver requests.  Fortunately,  rather  than  selective  waivers for the politically connected,  we have a universal remedy—repeal the  law.  I urge my colleagues to heed the calls  voters made last year during the debate and at the ballot box.  ",2011

67,9,2011-01-18,Mr. DOGGETT.," Mr. Speaker,  the  choice here is whether to give more  money to insurance monopolies or to  leave just a little bit in the pockets of  middle class Americans. But for House  Republicans, always putting insurance  companies  first  seems  to be a preexisting condition.  This bill isn’t repeal and replace; it is  repeal and  forget—forget  the health  care needs of millions of Americans,  forget the hundreds of billions of dollars that with this repeal they add to  our Federal debt.  Within a year, Allison, a 23-year-old  from Bastrop, Texas, who is completing  her college degree while caring for her  mother as her mother  faces another  round of breast cancer, would lose her  health insurance.  Emily, from Wimberley, who is battling cancer herself, would now  face  lifetime  limits  on what  doctor-recommended care her  insurer will pay  for. Of course, if her husband loses or  changes his job, she won’t have any insurance at all.  Charlotte, an Austin senior, would  have to pay more for prescriptions and  preventative health care, while Republicans reduce the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by more than a decade.  Family budgets would be crushed by  this bill as health care costs remain  the leading cause of credit card debt  and bankruptcy. This same devastating  Republican bill would also hike the  Federal debt. That’s why Republicans  have rejected pay-as-you-go budgeting  and instead will borrow from the Chinese to pay for this legislation.  Yes, repeal is a priority for the insurance companies and their apologists,  but neither our family budgets nor our  Federal budget can afford it. I believe  that every American is entitled to a  family doctor, not to an appointment  with a bankruptcy  judge because of  soaring health care costs.  ",2011

A few months ago, I visited with a  small business owner in Oklahoma who  has five employees but whose health  care costs for 2011 will go up by 50 percent. When he asked about that, the  reason he was given was: the cost of  implementing the new health care law.  Another business owner told me he  would not hire new employees until he  could  figure  out what  the  cost  of  health care is going to be, so he will  just stop hiring.  While  some  in  this Chamber  talk  about universal coverage and cost controls, many people in my district are  frustrated with this so-called  ‘‘solution.’’ Every person should control his  own health care option and opportunities. Every young student should have  the motivation to go into medical research and the practice of medicine. As  our  population  ages,  every  doctor  should have greater incentives to take  on Medicare patients.

74,16,2011-01-18,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Madam Speaker, I  rise in strong opposition to this bill  that would hurt small businesses  in  Missouri who are finally gaining access  to affordable coverage  for their employees. Since 2010, the health care  coverage among small  firms has  increased by more than 12 percent. If this  bill passes, those small business owners  will lose the tax credits that are providing up to 50 percent of their health  care costs. Many of them will have to  drop the very health insurance they  have  just now been able to provide  their employees and their families.  These are real people, people  like  Michelle Barron, who owns an  independent book store in Rock Hill, Missouri. She used to be able to afford coverage for her employees, but over the  years couldn’t keep up. She had to drop  her employees and finally drop her own  coverage because of preexisting conditions. Last year when the health care  bill was signed into law, new options  opened up for Michelle and countless  small business owners like her.  But if we repeal health care, it will  turn back the clock for small business  owners like Michelle. Insurers would be  able to go back to denying coverage for  preexisting medical  conditions,  and  small business owners would lose the  tax  credits  that  are helping make  health care coverage affordable. We  cannot go back to the bad old days of  insurance company control. This is not  the time to step backwards.  ",2011

76,16,2011-01-18,Mr. QUAYLE.," I thank the chairman  for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2.  Last year, behind closed doors and  against the will of the American people, the Democratic majority of the  111th Congress passed a bill that fundamentally changes the doctor-patient  relationship. They passed a bill that  will increase the cost of health care  and explode our national debt. They  passed a bill that expands the scope of  government well beyond the parameters set forth in the Constitution.  The genius of our Constitution  is  that this document didn’t set  forth  what the government must do for us,  but rather what the government can’t  do to us. Requiring every individual to  enter into a commercial contract certainly falls within the realm of what  the government can’t do to us.  The people in my district understand  this, just as they understand that our  health care system needs sensible, patient-centered reforms that will reduce  costs  and  increase  access. Unfortunately, the health care bill that was  passed will increase costs and increase  our national  debt. Yes,  those who  drafted the bill tried to conceal the  true costs from the American people.  But if you look beyond the accounting  gimmicks, that bill increases our debt  by $701 billion over the next 10 years.  It is time to get our country back on  the right track, and H.R. 2 is a necessary step to fulfilling that mission.  ",2011

78,16,2011-01-18,Ms.  WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ.,"  Madam Speaker, I think it is important to address the notion of job killing versus job creating. We’ve heard a  lot of talk about the title of this bill  and the jobs that it supposedly kills.  But let’s look at the facts here though.  Of the 1.1 million private-sector jobs—  documented—that were  created  last  year, fully 200,000 of those were in the  health care sector, or one-fifth. We’ve  actually had an average of 20,000 jobs  per month created in the health care  sector alone over the course of the last  2 years.  b1630  There have been no job losses in the  health care sector. None. And I challenge our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle, on the Republican side of  the aisle, who are vociferously advocating the repeal of health care reform  on the premise that it is a job killer to  name one area of health care, one,  where there have been  job  losses.  I  would  suspect  that we would hear  crickets chirping, because  there are  none. There  isn’t a  single area of  health care that there have been job  losses; not before health care reform  passed and not since.  Also, I think it is important to address the comments from my colleague  the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  GOHMERT) who stated that President  Obama  told  the Democratic Caucus  that health care  reform would  supposedly allow us to shrink five tests  performed on a patient to one. That is  simply not true. That never happened.  He never said that. And at the end of  the day we need to make sure that we  are entitled to our opinions but not to  our own facts.  I suspect that our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle are making up  their own  facts because  their arguments don’t stand on the strength of  their ideas and aren’t strong enough to  stand on their own. I thought it was  important to clear that up, Madam  Speaker.  ",2011

Madam Speaker, I believe we need  health care reform badly, but the law  we got isn’t what we need. That is why  I rise today in support of H.R. 2 to repeal the current health care law. The  health care  law provides  for an  increased government role and will ultimately lead to decisions made by the  government instead of doctors and patients.  It ignores the issue of cost. It was  loaded with gimmicks to make it seem  deficit neutral. But once those are accounted for, we find that it adds over  $700 billion to the deficit in the next 10  years.  The health care law, and especially  the unconstitutional mandate, handicaps our ability to grow jobs. Small  businesses will be hit hardest because  they operate on the tightest margins  and will have the toughest time complying with the onerous regulations,  many of which are still not written,  creating uncertainty for employers.  We must repeal the law and replace it  with one that lowers costs, preserves  the  doctor-patient  relationship,  lets  Americans keep  the  coverage  they  have, allows the private sector to create jobs and follows the Constitution.

America has always been a land of  self-determination.  Our  constitutionally guaranteed rights as individuals, as a people, as a Nation have  made  us  flourish.  Innovation,  creativity,  and  freedom  are American  hallmarks.  I rise in support of H.R. 2. It does not  indite intent, but it does address outcome. In fact, the deeper we dig into  the health care act, the more we discover that it is stopping job creation,  building more government, and placing  tax burdens on American families who  are already  struggling. We can and  must do better.  Let us commit ourselves to addressing the basic concerns we hold in common  concerning health  care—affordability and accessibility. Let us strive  to empower our people to make their  own choices about the care they receive, empower private sector solutions  that will lower costs and increase the  quality of care, and eliminate governmental stumbling blocks and not build  bigger government.  Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I  yield 21⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD).  Ms.  ROYBAL-ALLARD.  Madam  Speaker, today, millions of Americans  have more freedom to choose and control their health care as a result of the  Affordable Care Act.  In my congressional district, nearly  40 percent of my constituents were uninsured. Thousands more were underinsured and living on the brink of financial disaster when facing a serious  illness or accident. With health care  reform, positive change is taking place  for them and for individuals, families,  and small businesses throughout the  country.  Young adults are grateful they can  remain  on  their  parents’  insurance  until age 26; seniors living in fear of  not being able to afford their medications are  thankful  for discounts on  brand-name drugs when reaching the  doughnut  hole;  families  with  preexisting conditions are comforted by  the new high-risk insurance pool; and  those facing serious illness are relieved  their insurers can no longer drop them  when they need coverage the most.  Small businesses, which abound  in  my district and which are a mainstay  in our Latino and minority communities, can take advantage of tax credits to offer health insurance to their  employees.  A 2009 study by MIT economist Jonathan Gruber  found that, without reform, over the next decade employers  will pay trillions of dollars in employee  health  costs;  will  potentially  cut  170,000 small business  jobs; and will  lose $51.2 billion in profits. That is why  John Arensmeyer, founder and CEO of  the Small Business Majority, supports  health care reform.  Madam Speaker, H.R.  2 will hurt  small business. It will repeal the freedoms and protections Americans now  have, and it will return control of their  health care to the insurance companies.  ",2011

In March, Members  of  Congress  passed  a  massive  government-run  health care  law that will kill  jobs,  raise taxes, and increase the size of our  Federal Government.  b1700  The bill called for tax increases on  American families, wasteful spending  of taxpayer dollars, and new mandates  on  small businesses. This  is wrong.  Voters made it clear in November that  ‘‘business as usual’’ must end.  I submitted the necessary paperwork  to decline the health care plan offered  to Members of Congress. I rejected this  benefit because Washington must work  just  like the American people must  work. We are not above them. I hope  my actions will energize the efforts to  repeal the government-run health care  law.  I encourage my colleagues to vote  ‘‘yes’’ on this bill and to promote commonsense  solutions  of  purchasing  health insurance across State lines and  pooling small businesses together to leverage purchasing power.

I commend the Republican leadership  for simplifying this process by drafting  a two-page, stand-alone bill for repeal.  It will be very clear, Madam Speaker,  to the American people where we stand  on repeal.  During this past campaign, I, like a  lot of candidates, spoke to small businesses every single day. There is a reason why 90 percent of small business  men and women in this country support repeal. From the billions in taxes,  to the needless paperwork, to the burdensome regulations, to the 1.6 million  estimated job loss, small business men  and women are adamant that we need  to repeal.  Finally, Madam Speaker, our opposition last year said that if you like your  plan, you can keep it. To date, there  are 222 organizations, including some  of ObamaCare’s  biggest  union  supporters, who have  received waivers.  Why? Why, Madam Speaker, if the law  was so worthy, would there be a need  for waivers?  Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ.

Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  MURPHY).  ",2011
90,23,2011-01-18,Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut.," Madam  Speaker, when I testified against this  repeal before the Rules Committee, I  told a story about a family in my district. The husband  lost his  job and,  therefore, his insurance because of a  debilitating injury. This family faced a  choice: They either had to dip  into  their  savings  account,  their  high  school son’s college fund, or they had  to sell their house. They chose to first  spend down the college account so that  they could keep a roof over their head.  When I told that story, one Republican on the committee basically said,  Wait, I don’t get it. They had money,  they had a house, why should somebody else pay for their health care if  they had assets?  Well, that Member was right about  one thing: She didn’t get it. And Republicans don’t get it. Because in a nation as compassionate as this, no family should be forced out on the street  just because one of their family members gets sick. There is a moral imperative behind making sure that we live  up to our duty to be our brother’s keeper.  But it’s more than that. There is a  fiscal imperative here. What she also  didn’t get was that once that family’s  savings is gone, once they’re out on the  street, we all pick up the cost. Small  businesses pick up the cost. That’s why  small businesses are paying 18 percent  more than big businesses. That’s why  about $1,100 of every single premium  for a small business employee goes to  cover the uninsured.  There are thousands of small businesses in Connecticut organized under  the auspices of a group called Small  Businesses for Health Care Reform that  are crying out for this repeal to be defeated because they see the $260 billion  price tag attached to this bill that is  going to land on their head, as well as  the  continuation  of  discriminatory  practices that ask small businesses to  pay for the uninsured like that family  that I talked about.  This bill isn’t anything more than a  political statement, but families in my  district, small businesses  in my district need more than politics. They  need answers.  ",2011

They have done a wonderful job repairing the broken bodies and spirits of our  young servicemembers.  The number of wounded warriors returning  from war has become more  prevalent with the  increased use of  IEDs by the enemy. More and more of  our young men and women are returning without their arms and legs. Tonight, Mr. Speaker, as a constant reminder of the pain of war, I show you  this picture of a young triple amputee  and his wife. This man gave his body  for this country and will struggle for  the rest of his life. How many more  will have to return home in this condition?  This young man and his wife have  just returned from the hospital. He is  in a wheelchair. He lost an arm and  two legs and he is looking at a beautiful American flag that was on the  wall that had been drawn for him.  It is time we declare victory and get  our troops out of Afghanistan. It is evident that President Karzai does not appreciate our commitment. If he did, he  would not be so corrupt. If he did, he  would not have made the comments  that he now has three main enemies—  the Taliban, the United States and the  international community as stated in  the Washington Post on December 13.  He said that if he had to choose sides  today, he would choose the Taliban.  The Taliban are killing American service men and women.  Mr. Speaker, I have joined DENNIS  KUCINICHas well as many other members of both parties in the hope that  President Obama will keep his promise  to start withdrawing our troops in July  of this year.  b1920  In closing, I would like to urge the  American people to get engaged in this  cause and to let their Members of Congress know how they feel. They must  encourage the Members of Congress to  vote to bring our troops home. The  pain must end, and we can easily declare a victory and bring our brave  men and women home.  Mr. Speaker, as I do all the time on  the floor of the House when I speak, I  ask God to please bless our men and  women in uniform, to bless the families  of our men and women in uniform. I  ask God in his loving arms to hold the  families who have given a child dying  for freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq. I  ask God to please bless the House and  Senate that we will do what is right for  the American people.

96,30,2011-01-18,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, our Nation is now in its 10th straight year of  war. The military occupation of Afghanistan is longer than any war in our  Nation’s history. An entire generation  of young people—including my three  grandchildren who came with me to  visit Washington for the swearing in—  is growing up knowing nothing but a  Nation at war.  This war is not just a moral abomination with devastating human costs,  and it is not just fiscally irresponsible  and unsustainable with a price tag of  about $370 billion, though it most certainly is all of that. Perhaps the most  tragic irony of this war is, for all of the  sacrifice, it is not even doing what it  was supposed to do: keeping us safe and  defeating a terrorist threat.  If Iraq and Afghanistan have proven  anything to us, Mr. Speaker, it is that  we need an entirely new national security model; one that emphasizes brain  over brawn; one that uses soft power  instead  of hard;  one  that  protects  America by relying on the most honorable American values—love of freedom,  desire for peace, moral leadership, and  compassion for the people of the world.

98,37,2011-01-18,Mr.  GARAMENDI.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  thank you for this opportunity to discuss health care this evening.  But before I get to health care, I was  notified early this afternoon that a  unique,  iconic American  had  died  today; Sargent Shriver  is no  longer  with us.  This individual has had an impact on  America and the world around us that  will last for centuries. He literally created the United States Peace Corps.  The idea was developed by him and his  brother-in-law, JFK, and put into effect in the first year of the Jack Kennedy administration.  Thousands, indeed over nearly 200,000  Americans,  have  joined  the  Peace  Corps  in the ensuing years. For my  wife and  I,  it changed our  life;  it  changed the path upon which we have  traveled. We were the third iteration of  the Peace Corps back in the 1960s. We  were sent to Ethiopia. We served in a  village out in the boondocks of southwestern Ethiopia, and it put in place in  our lives the vision that we could and  should continue to serve.  We are not alone. Thousands upon  thousands of Americans,  those  that  were in the Peace Corps and those that  were affected by the Peace Corps here  in this Nation, found that same mission of being a life of service.  In  the  1990s, Sargent Shriver  returned once again to assist the Peace  Corps as the Clinton administration  undertook the rebuilding and expansion of the Peace Corps. My wife was  then working at the Peace Corps as the  associate director, and together they  and the other staff opened the Peace  Corps to the former Soviet Union nations, Eastern Europe and beyond and  also to South Africa. It was a period of  growth, and once again it was a period  in which the Shriver enthusiasm and  the Shriver determination to reach out  to everyone in this world so that they  could have a better life created these  opportunities.  We mourn his passage. Our prayers  go out to his family and to remind all  of us that we too in any way possible  should be serving our fellow man.  Sergeant Shriver, we miss you and  we know that America and millions of  people around the world that were affected by your programs will miss you  also.  Let me now turn to another issue  that affects every American, their well  being, their lives, their ability to get  the care that they need when they have  health care problems.  On this floor today we began the debate of the repeal of the Affordable  Health Care Act, an extraordinary law  that will affect each and every one of  us in this Nation; and as it affects us,  it will also affect people around the  world because this law will help America finally join the other industrialized  nations in the world and provide health  care to all of our people, not just those  who are fortunate enough to be employed by an employer who has found  it useful, wise or even correct to provide health care for their employees,  but for those individuals that are not  so fortunate to be with an employer  that does not provide health care, and  for those who are unemployed.  This is an extremely important debate going on here on the floor of the  House. It’s a debate about all of our  lives.

101,58,2011-01-18,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor and remember the life of Arnold ‘‘Arnie’’  Amell, the chair of Plattsburgh State’s College  Council in Upstate New York.  A native of Beekmantown, New York, Arnie  spent decades devoting his  life  to  the New  York education system. Throughout the years,  he served as a teacher, a guidance counselor,  director of guidance, assistant principal and  principal. Outside of the classroom, he served  as a member of the college council at SUNY  Plattsburgh, President of the Kiwanis Club of  Schenectady, and a member of the Northeast  Parent and Child Society. Most recently, he  spent the last two years as chair of the College Council at SUNY Plattsburgh. Through  his decades of service, he worked to enhance  the quality of education youth receive in Upstate New York, and provided a strong foundation for countless students of all ages.  Everyone who knew Arnie can say that they  knew a man completely devoted to his family  and his community. I have personally known  Arnie for years and have served on the college council at Plattsburgh State University  with him.  The Plattsburgh community has lost a true  friend and a great leader, but his memory and  spirit will continue  to  inspire generations of  Upstate New Yorkers who will work to better  their community in this tradition.  f  IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT  OF ASSISTANT CHIEF HARLAND  WESTMORELAND  HON. KENNY MARCHANT  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 18, 2011  ",2011
102,58,2011-01-18,Mr. MARCHANT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to  recognize Mr. Harland Westmoreland, a  dedicated public servant who will retire as assistant chief of the Euless Police Department.  As assistant chief, Mr. Westmoreland carried  out his duties with honor, boldness, and enthusiasm. With a commitment to service, Mr.  Westmoreland has been a leader in the Euless Police Department over  the past 35  years.  Mr. Westmoreland was born  in Gorman,  Texas and attended Reagan County High  School in Big Lake, Texas and Dallas Baptist  University  for both undergraduate and graduate school. At Dallas Baptist University, Mr.  Westmoreland earned a masters degree  in  counseling and psychology. Along with numerous certifications and licenses, Mr. Westmoreland is a master peace officer. Mr. Westmoreland and his wife Juanita reside in Euless and  have four children and ten grandchildren.  In 1974, while working in the private sector,  Mr. Westmoreland  joined  the Euless Police  Department as a reserve officer. By 1975, Mr.  Westmoreland chose  to make  law enforcement and public service a full time career. In  1982, Mr. Westmoreland became an investigator, and in 1985 he was promoted to sergeant.  In January 1993, Mr. Westmoreland  was promoted to lieutenant, and in December  of the same year he earned the rank of captain.  In September 2004, Mr. Westmoreland  became assistant police chief of the city of Euless.  Assistant Chief Westmoreland has  committed his career to protecting the citizens and  community of Euless. Throughout his career in  law enforcement, Mr. Westmoreland has positively affected  the  lives of countless  individuals. As exemplified by his many acts of heroism, Mr. Westmoreland has sacrificed his  well-being to ensure the public safety of the  residents of Euless. I ask all of my colleagues  to  join  in recognizing Assistant Police Chief  Westmoreland for his bravery, for his courage,  and for his distinguished career with the Euless Police Department.  f  THE HOUSE’S READING OF THE  CONSTITUTION  HON. RUSH D. HOLT  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 18, 2011  ",2011
103,58,2011-01-18,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, when we read the  Constitution in this body on January 6, 2011,  we missed a good opportunity. I joined in the  reading. I was certainly not going to allow one  political party to claim the Constitution for its  own, as it has sometimes tried to claim the  U.S.  flag. However, by  reading an altered  version of  the Constitution and by doing so  without warrant we  lost a great educational  moment.  I revere the U.S. Constitution and carry a  copy of the Constitution with me every day. I  often ask students what  they  think  is  the  greatest  invention of humans. Because  they  know that I am a scientist, they usually say  something  technical  like  the  laser  or  a  microchip  in answer  to my question.  I reply  that  the greatest  invention  is  the U.S. Constitution. It is truly ingenious: Because of this  document, our brilliant, resilient, self-correcting  system of government, dreamed up in Philadelphia so many years ago, still functions well  today. The system inspires and motivates people around the world.  Instead  of  reading  the  full Constitution,  members of the House took turns reading an  altered text based on the amendments. I was  further  troubled  to  learn  that  because  of  human error we skipped two pages during our  reading.  The altered  text omitted  the original  language of Article I, Section 2 that counted each  black individual as only three-fifths of a person  for  the purposes of apportionment of Representatives, omitting it and reading only the  text of the 14th Amendment that apportioned  Representatives according to the total number  of all male citizens. Yet, Article I, Section 3  that proscribes  that  the  two Senators  from  each state be chosen by the state legislature,  a passage of  the Constitution subsequently  amended by the 17th Amendment, was read  in its original format.  The decision to not read the full text ignores  the fundamental strength of the U.S. Constitution—its  implicit  recognition  that  the United  States of America is an imperfect, ever evolving, self-correcting union. The Constitution is  not a perfect document, and the Founders did  not have all  the answers. African American  were  counted as  three-fifths of a person.  Women were disenfranchised. The concept of  privacy was glossed over. The full text of the  Constitution and its Amendments should have  been read today to help American recall and  understand how we have  strived and  still  strive ‘‘to form a more perfect Union.’’  The  Constitution  was  a  compromise  throughout. In addition to counting each black  individual as only  three-fifths of a person,  it  was virtually silent on slavery, the great injustice of the day. But after a way that almost destroyed the Union, after more than half a million died, and when brother fought brother, the  Constitution was amended and updated to reflect the will of the people. Today, the American experiment continues  to  improve. Freedoms and protections of rights keep growing  in the face of both consistent and ever-changing threats.  Langston Hughes—an American who was  denied the rights and freedoms that all of us  deserve—wrote  in Let America Be America  Again, 1938,  O, yes,  I say it plain,  America never was America to me,  And yet I swear this oath—  America will be!  Students  attending  under-performing  schools, millions of Americans without health  insurance,  and  widespread  poverty  demonstrate that even today, America never was  America for far too many of us. But our Constitution lets us admit when we are wrong and  correct our mistakes. Our collective vision of  America must include an expanding sphere of  freedom, liberty, and opportunity for all. And  most importantly, we must never believe we  are so  infallible  that we  fail  to strive  for a  ‘‘more perfect Union.’’  f  CONGRATULATIONS PERRY  FAMILY  HON. JOE WILSON  OFSOUTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 18, 2011  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to congratulate my good friend  Richard Perry, a Washington and Lee University graduate, and his wife Kristin Perry on the  birth of  their daughter Liza May Perry. Liza  was born on Saturday, January 1, 2011,  in  Washington, DC.  Liza May Perry  is  six pounds and  two  ounces of pride and joy to her loving grandparents, Anne and Robert ‘‘Skipper’’ Perry, Jr.  of Aiken, South Carolina, and Winifred Joan  Off of West Chester, Pennsylvania. I am so  excited for this new blessing to the Perry family and wish them all the best.

104,6,2011-01-25,Mr. CICILLINE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today with serious concerns about the  misguided agenda our friends on the  other side of the aisle are pursuing.  While Democrats continue to make  job creation, economic recovery, and  debt reduction top priorities, the majority continues to engage in political  theater.  In  fact,  their  first actions  after assuming control of the House  haven’t created a single  job or protected a single American business.  Instead, the other side’s top priority  has been to repeal the patient protections provided by the new health care  reform bill; and their so-called ‘‘budget  resolution’’ they have offered today is  a one-page document with no specific  cuts  to  reduce  spending, no budget  numbers and, most  importantly, no  ideas on job creation or on economic  recovery.  Mr. Speaker, we were sent here to  create jobs and get the American economy back on track, both the Republicans and Democrats. Let’s stop the  political gimmickry, and let’s get to  the work of putting the American people back to work.  f  DEFICIT REDUCTION PLANS—NOT  AMBIGUOUS GOALS  (Mr. ALTMIRE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2011
105,6,2011-01-25,Mr. ALTMIRE.," Mr. Speaker, as we  look forward to tonight’s State of the  Union Address, it is important for all  of us to keep in mind the most important  issues to the American people:  jobs, the economy, and deficit reduction. In the weeks and months ahead,  we look forward to working together,  Democrats and Republicans, to focus  our  legislative  attention  on  these  issues.  As we debate these issues, it is easy  to simply identify the problem. We all  know that unemployment is too high,  that recovery is not as fast as we would  like, and that the deficit is out of control; but the time for simply defining  the problem has long since passed, and  realistic solutions are long overdue. As  we near completion of our first month  of the new Congress, the American people are still waiting to hear the majority’s specific recommendations on how  to address these issues.  Tonight, we will hear from the President. I look forward to soon hearing  from the majority some specific details  about their deficit reduction plans, not  just ambiguous goals.  b1210  HONORING FALLEN OFFICERS IN  ST.

106,6,2011-01-25,Ms.  CASTOR  of Florida.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today to honor the sacrifice of two St. Petersburg, Florida,  police officers who were killed in the  line of duty yesterday.  Sergeant Tom Baitinger and Officer  Jeffrey Yaslowitz were following up on  a Fugitive Task Force warrant when  they and a deputy U.S. marshal were  ambushed and shot. Officer Yaslowitz  was fatally shot while trying to arrest  the  dangerous  fugitive;  Officer  Baitinger was shot while attempting to  rescue his colleagues.  Officer Yaslowitz was 39 years old. He  was a K–9 officer and had worked with  his canine partner, ‘‘Ace,’’ for the last  2 years. He is survived by his wife, Lorraine, and three young children. Sergeant Thomas J. Baitinger was 48 years  old. He is survived by his wife, Paige.  As my colleague, Congressman BILL  stated  yesterday  from  this  floor, we pray for their families, the St.  Petersburg Police Department, Mayor  Bill Foster, and Police Chief Chuck  Harmon, and we honor the sacrifice of  our community heroes and all who  wear the uniform of service.

107,6,2011-01-25,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Madam Speaker, I  want to give  folks a preview of tonight’s off-Broadway performance that  will follow the President’s State of the  Union Address.  The stage will be the House Budget  Committee hearing room. The actor in  the one-man show will be Republican  Representative PAULRYAN from Wisconsin. The  script will  begin with  something like, Hello, I’m Representative PAULRYAN, and I’m speaking to  you from the very location where the  Democratic job-killing spending binge  unfolded during the last 2 years. Unfortunately, the script for tonight’s performance will not include the fact that  Democratic investments have created  more jobs during the last 2 years than  were created during the entire 8 years  of George Bush. You also won’t hear  about the one thing that Republicans  fought tooth and nail for during the  last 2 years: an extension of a budget-  busting  $700  billion  tax  break  for  wealthy Americans.  Coming attractions? The chairman  will have another show  in the next  week where he pulls a budget number  from a hat filled with rabbits. That  will be our budget number. Enjoy the  show.  CALLING FOR TRANSPARENCY IN  CAMPAIGN FINANCE  (Mr. MCNERNEY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2011
108,6,2011-01-25,Mr. MCNERNEY.," Madam Speaker, I  rise to discuss the importance of reducing the influence of corporate special  interest money in our elections.  As a result of the Citizens United decision, corporations and other special  interests are free to pump unlimited  sums of money into campaign attacks.  And worse yet, because of this decision  there is no good mechanism to keep  money from foreign sources out of our  elections. We need reform that brings  transparency to the campaign finance  system and protects the best interests  of middle class families.  I will call on the new majority to  work in a bipartisan fashion to bring  transparency to the campaign finance  system. I supported the DISCLOSE Act  last year, and I believe this bill is a  good first step. I will continue standing  up for middle class families.  f  USING AMERICAN RESOURCES TO  CREATE JOBS  (Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute.)  ",2011
109,6,2011-01-25,Mr.  MURPHY  of  Pennsylvania.,"  Madam Speaker, tonight we will hear  about the State of the Union. I hope we  hear the sometimes painful truth about  the State of the Union: more jobs lost  in the last couple of years and we need  to do something about that.  But the answer is not more spending  that leads us to a greater deficit and  more borrowing from China. The answer is not to continue to have higher  gas prices because we are buying our  oil from OPEC, which they use to build  their  lavish palaces and drive their  Rolls Royces while our communities  are trying to find ways to afford the  patching compound to patch up our  potholes. What we need to be doing is  taking action that uses our resources  to create American jobs.  A bill that I am going to be reintroducing from last year is one that says,  Let’s stop this moratorium that prevents us from using our oil, from drilling our resources. We can actually create jobs and have about $3 trillion-plus  in Federal  revenue without  raising  taxes, without raising our trade deficit,  and without sending more money to  OPEC.  I hope this is something this Congress considers and this President has  an open mind to dealing with so that  we can create  jobs without creating  more deficit.  f  STANDING TOGETHER FOR THE  ECONOMY  (Mr. HIMES asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

121,13,2011-01-25,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, this past election  was certainly a historic pivot for our  Nation.  The  American  people  demanded that both the President of the  United States, as well as the Congress,  chart a new course because they understand  that  the  growth  of Federal  spending that we have seen for the last  several  years  is  completely  unsustainable. They understand that  this crushing burden of debt that we  are selfishly placing on our children  and our grandchildren is limiting their  opportunities. And  they also understand very clearly that this irresponsible, out-of-control Federal spending  is limiting our ability for job creation  and economic growth.  Today, this resolution clearly speaks  to the House Republicans’ Pledge to  America by demonstrating our commitment to reduce spending to pre-  stimulus, pre-bailout levels, to a level  of spending of 2008.  Many would say, Madam Speaker,  that this doesn’t even go far enough,  and that debate will continue this year  as we debate the CR, the budget resolution, and the vote for raising the debt  ceiling.  Today, Madam  Speaker,  I  would urge all of my colleagues to vote  ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution and let the  American people know that we heard  them loud and clear in November.  ",2011
122,13,2011-01-25,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Madam Speaker, I  think what the American people are interested in is serious legislating and serious discussion on how to get this  budget under control and not political  posturing.

123,13,2011-01-25,Mr. ANDREWS.,"  I  thank  tleman for yielding.  All those who care  for and think  about the 15 million unemployed people in this country, on both sides of the  aisle, want the Congress to work together to help small businesses and entrepreneurs create jobs for Americans,  but the new majority, right out of the  gate, has ignored that obligation.  The first week, they ignored the deficit and passed a set of rules that says  they can pretend it doesn’t exist when  they want to do something. Then they  increased the deficit by repealing the  health  care  bill. The Congressional  Budget Office says that adds $230 billion to the deficit over 10 years and  more than $1 trillion over 20 years.  This week, they are hiding the deficit.  They brought to the floor a bill that  wants the American people to guess  what the numbers will be under which  we will live in the future.  This is not the way to create jobs, either generally or specifically. Here is  one fact the Members ought to take  into consideration. Last year, the departments that would be subject to up  to a 25 percent spending cut under this  bill made a million  contracts with  small businesses that gave $60 billion  worth of work to caterers, electricians,  other small businesses.  What will happen to the jobs created  by those small businesses if this 25 percent cut goes through?  Now, I say a  ‘‘25 percent cut’’ advisedly, because I do think we want to  take one more attempt at finding out,  and I would yield to the chairman of  the Rules Committee, will the spending  bill that eventually gets here cut by 25  percent to 2006 levels or by 22 percent  to 2008 levels? I would yield to anyone  on the other side who could answer  that question for us.  the  gentleman  What will the number be in the bill  that eventually gets here?  ",2011

142,41,2011-01-25,Mr. HATCH.," Madam President, in recent months President Obama has frequently  discussed  our Nation’s  disturbing fiscal situation.  He is right to do so.  Our yearly deficits and accumulated  debt hang over the futures of our children and grandchildren like a sword of  Damocles.  Though he was late to the table on  this issue, President Obama seems to  have finally recognized the frustration  and anger of the American people over  our Federal fiscal policy.  Recognizing that you have a problem  is an important first step, and I applaud the administration for speaking  about our Nation’s structural deficits.  But this is a critical issue, and any  solution will require that those responsible give a full and fair accounting of  the policies that led to this crisis.  Unfortunately, rather than own up to  his administration’s complicity in our  fiscal imbalance, the President prefers  to blame our current and future fiscal  problems on the previous administration.  For this President, the buck always  seems to stop over there.  This trope is getting old.

144,48,2011-01-25,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, during  the recent 2-week recess, I was invited  to speak to the Parliament of the nation of Lithuania  in  the capital of  Vilnius.  It was a great honor. This  country holds a special place in my  family. My mother was born in Lithuania. One hundred years ago  this  year, my grandmother brought her, her  brother, and  sister  to America. My  mother was 2 years old. They landed in  Baltimore, and  somehow our  family  found  its way to meet up with my  grandfather  in East St. Louis,  IL,  where a lot of Lithuanian immigrants  were coming to take jobs—hard, manual labor jobs, which immigrants took  in  those days and  still do—manual  labor  jobs that gave them a chance  they did not have in the old country.  I was asked to speak to the Parliament on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of what has  come  to be  known as bloody Sunday. It recalls the  time,  20  years  ago, when Mikhail  Gorbachev,  as  head  of  the  Soviet  Union, made his last, desperate, violent  effort to stop Lithuania from breaking  away from the Soviet Union.  I recall that period because I  followed it closely as a Member of Congress. You can still see some details of  what life was like in Lithuania under  the  Soviets. The  old  police  headquarters, the KGB headquarters, has  been preserved as a museum—basically,  a horror museum to show and catalog  the  torture and killings  that  took  place during Soviet rule.  In February 1990, the people of this  tiny nation on the Baltic decided they  had had enough. They swept the ruling  Communist Party out of power in an  open parliamentary election. A month  later  in March  1990,  the new Parliament voted 124 to 0 to restore the  country’s independence. They were the  first Soviet Republic to do so. It was  bold.  It was historic. That  is when  Gorbachev turned the screws. He ordered Soviet tanks and paratroopers to  stop the breakaway effort of Lithuania.  In the early morning hours of January 13, 1991, 14 Lithuanians, just regular people, common people  in  the  country, were killed and as many as  1,000 were rounded up by those the  Economist magazine described as the  ‘‘bullies of Vilnius.’’  The crackdown failed. By August of  1991, Lithuania had won its independence again.  Today, because of the brave efforts of  those ordinary Lithuanians, it is a free  country, it is democratic, chair of the  Community of Democracies, is a member of the European Union, and one of  America’s allies in NATO.  Imagine my surprise at what I saw  during a stop in the neighboring counstill  try of Belarus. I saw a step back into  Soviet times, a step back into the barbarism we found in the KGB Museum  in Lithuania. Sadly, though, this was  not a museum show. It was real life.  Often known as the last dictatorship  of Europe, Belarus has defied the democratic transformations that have swept  across Europe following the collapse of  the Soviet Union. The country has  been ruled with an iron fist for most of  the last few decades by a strongman,  Alexander  Lukashenko.  In  Lukashenko’s  two-decade-old  totalitarian nightmare, opposition figures—  anybody who had courage to step up  and defy him—had been subjected to  harsh  repression  and  imprisonment.  Over the years, those who might have  been alternatives  to Lukashenko  in  any election have disappeared or have  been thrown in jail.  In  fact, Lukashenko proudly  calls his police force the KGB.  In recent years, there was a glimmer  of hope that perhaps Lukashenko was  going to move away from his dictatorship. A Presidential election was scheduled  for  last December 19, one that  some hoped would  finally meet  the  most minimum international standards  for democracy.  Those  hopes  were  dashed  when  Lukashenko quickly claimed another  term as President amid elections described by  international monitors as  seriously flawed. He ended up with 80  percent of the vote and said that was a  good indication that it was a real election. He did not get 99 percent, as  usual.  Lukashenko ordered his KGB thugs  to brutally suppress opposition candidates, activists, and supporters who  gathered in protest on election night in  Independence  Square  in  downtown  Minsk in the nation of Belarus on December 19, last year. Six of the seven  political opponents who  ran against  Lukashenko and more than 600 of their  followers were arrested. Several of the  Presidential candidates who are being  held  incommunicado still today  face  charges that can carry up to 15 years in  jail. Their crime? They ran against him  and they lost. They get to go to jail  now.  Since then, Lukashenko’s KGB has  continued daily raids on the homes and  offices of those with suspected ties to  democratic parties and organizations,  human rights organizations, and what  remains of the independent media in  Belarus.  Lukashenko  has  ignored  election  monitor reports questioning the credibility of the election and international  demands to release all these political  prisoners. He has pulled the country  further into isolation and made it the  subject of international scorn.  He follows the old Soviet playbook.  His government has tried to blame outside forces in other countries, everyone  but himself, for the shameful political  mess he has created.

145,62,2011-01-25,Mr. MERKLEY.," Mr. President, it is  quite a contrast that the Senator is  drawing between an era in which in a 2-  week period the bulk of the team was  in place, ready to do the work they  were elected by the people to do—the  executive branch, headed by the President, had his Secretaries, and the Secretaries had their teams in place, and  they were ready to go forward to make  sure they were working hard on the  agenda they had laid out during the  election cycle.  As my colleague said, elections have  consequences. The vision of our Republic is one in which we elect a President,  and the President says: Here  is my  agenda. Then he puts together a team  to get it done. It is not in the spirit of  our Constitution, it is certainly not in  the spirit of our democratic souls, after  the people have elected a President, to  try to damage and inflict pain and obstruction upon that President. That is  essentially saying one does not accept  the  judgment of U.S. citizens about  electing the President.  This process has to change. We have  to find a way that folks can be brought  to the floor. It is not that this Chamber will approve every single nomination. It is that it will hold a debate and  have a vote. If there is no controversy  surrounding someone, then that will  probably be reduced to a unanimous  consent request. Some will be waived  through to not take up the time on the  floor of the Chamber.  There is more than 1,000 executive  branch positions that have to be confirmed under statute. That, too, should  be changed. There is far too many positions that are basically set up so that  they have to come to this Chamber.  That is certainly a subject of conversation. But for those that under the law  need to come for advice and consent,  then we need to exercise that responsibility in a manner that is consistent  with advise and consent but not with  attempting to damage the President  and his team.  I was looking at a speech by one of  my colleagues from Tennessee, ",2011
146,62,2011-01-25,Mr. ALEXANDER.," He titles it, ‘‘The Filibuster,  Democracy’s Finest Show, the Right to  Talk Your Head Off.’’ That quote at  the top of his paper is from a speech before the Heritage Foundation and  is  taken  directly  from  the  film  ‘‘Mr.  Smith Goes to Washington.’’ In other  words, the premise that my colleague  put in his paper is that there needs to  be the right of the people elected by  the citizens to have their voices heard  on the floor of the Senate. That is what  the talking filibuster is about. It is  about the people being able to see their  Senators, when they are saying there  needs to be additional debate, to actually debate.  There is a tremendous amount of bipartisan support for this notion that  Senators  should not hide  from  the  American people, that they should not  be engaging  in secret holds, but  instead, if they are going to place a hold  on a piece of legislation, to do it publicly and have accountability. There is  tremendous support for the notion that  when we proceed to vote that we want  additional  debate, we  are  actually  going to debate so we utilize the time  of the Senate to weigh the pros and  cons, to hear all colleagues. Not that  folks say: We want additional debate  and then go off to dinner. Not that Senators say: We want additional debate  and then go off on vacation.  If  they ask  for additional debate,  then we should have additional debate,  laying out the pros and cons, arguing  the merits, considering amendments—  in short, the talking filibuster.  I have a unanimous consent request  that I gave notice of half an hour ago.  We are standing by waiting for one of  our colleagues from the other side to  come, extending the courtesy for them  to come and object to this request. I  am saying this out loud and looking  across the aisle and saying we have  been waiting half an hour.

147,118,2011-01-25,Mr.  LIEBERMAN.," Mr.  President,  today, I introduced legislation to protect the coastal plains region of the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from  oil and gas exploration and drilling.  Every Congress since the 101st, I have  either introduced or been an original  cosponsor of legislation to protect the  Refuge, making tomorrow the twelfth  time since 1989 that I will mark my unwavering support for reaffirming the  original intent of the Refuge: to provide habitat for Alaska’s wildlife, by  designating 1.5 million acres of the Refuge as Wilderness to be included in the  National Wilderness Preservation System.  I have long believed we have a responsibility to  future generations to  preserve the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge, and I have fought to protect it  for as long as I have been in the Senate. The fact is, we do not have to  choose between conservation and exploration when it comes to our energy  future; we can do both simultaneously  while moving toward a sustainable and  diverse national energy policy.  The Arctic Refuge is home to 250 species of wildlife. Drilling there would severely harm its abundant populations  of polar bears, caribou, musk oxen, and  snow geese. Beyond that, the amount  of commercially recoverable oil in the  Refuge would satisfy only a very small  percentage of our Nation’s need at any  given time and would have no appreciable  long-tem  impact on gasoline  prices. The permanent environmental  price we would pay for ravaging the  Refuge to drain those limited resources  is simply too high.  I look forward to working with my  colleagues to pass this important legislation.  By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. SANDERS,  Mrs. BOXER, Mr. DURBIN, Mr.  BROWNof Ohio and Mr. HARKIN):  S. 45.

148,118,2011-01-25,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Mr. President,  from the Recovery Act to the Small  Business Jobs Act, in the previous Congress we passed a number of substantial pieces of legislation to preserve,  protect, and create American jobs. The  Recovery Act alone has supported between 2.7 and 3.7 million jobs, including  12,000 jobs in my home State of Rhode  Island. This was vital in stemming the  700,000-per-month job loss rate we faced  when the previous administration left  office. Without the Recovery Act and  the other  fiscal stimulus we passed  over the past 2 years, the economy  would have been much worse.  While  the Recovery Act protected  our country  from what would have  been a far worse economic meltdown,  the employment market is still weak  and families are still hurting. Our national unemployment rate was 9.4 percent  in December—an  unacceptably  high level. And it was higher still in  harder hit States such as Rhode Island,  where we have had an 11.5-percent unemployment rate in December. As we  begin this new Congress, our No. 1 priority must remain job retention and  creation.  The manufacturing industry has historically been the engine of growth for  the American economy. The manufacturing economy has been especially important  in the  industrial Northeast,  particularly in my State of Rhode Island. From Slater Mill in Pawtucket—  one of the first water-powered textile  mills in the Nation and the birthplace  of the Industrial Revolution—to high-  tech modern submarine production at  Quonset Point, the manufacturing sector has always been central to Rhode  Island’s economy.  Unfortunately, as American companies have faced rising production costs  and increased—and very often unfair—  competition  from  foreign  firms, U.S.  manufacturing employment has plummeted. According  to  the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, the number of manufacturing  jobs declined by almost a  third over the past decade, from 17.2  million people at work in 2000 to 11.7  million people at work in 2010. That is  6 million jobs lost. This decline has  been felt most sharply in our old manufacturing centers, such as Rhode Island. In Rhode Island, the loss of manufacturing jobs in the past decade has  topped 44 percent. The decline of the  manufacturing sector is a primary reason why Rhode Island has had greater  difficulty than most other States in recovering from the recent recession.  Over and over I have traveled around  Rhode Island to meet with local manufacturers,  listening  to  their  frustrations and discussing ideas to help their  businesses grow. During these visits, I  have heard one theme over and over:  Unfair foreign competition is killing  domestic  industries. One Pawtucket  manufacturer I visited last week told  me they recently lost 8 percent of their  business to a Chinese competitor. It is  clear to me that if we want to keep  manufacturing jobs in this country and  ERS, BOXER, DURBIN, BROWN in Rhode Island, we need to level the  playing  field  for our manufacturing  companies with their foreign competitors.  Today  I will  introduce  legislation  that will remove one homegrown incentive to move jobs offshore and help to  make competition fairer for companies  straggling to keep their factory doors  open at plants here  in  the United  States. The Offshoring Prevention Act,  cosponsored by Senators LEAHY, SANDof Ohio,  and HARKIN, would end a perverse tax  incentive that actually rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas. Under  current  law, an American  company  that manufactures goods in Rhode Island or Montana or Maine must pay  Federal income tax on profits in the  year the profits are earned. That  is  standard tax  law. But  if that same  company moves its factory to another  country, it is permitted to defer the  payment of income taxes from that factory and declare them in a year that is  more advantageous—for example, one  in which the company has offsetting  tax losses.  If an American company moves a  plant offshore, it acquires this tax deferral advantage. It makes no sense  that our Tax Code allows companies to  delay paying income taxes on profits  when made through overseas subsidiaries but charges those profits in the  year they are made at home. My bill  will put a stop to this practice on profits earned on manufactured goods exported to the United States. To put it  simply: Our tax system should not reward companies for eliminating American jobs.  The Offshoring Prevention Act  is  based on  legislation Senator Byron  Dorgan offered over the past two decades, again and again. We can all remember Senator Dorgan coming to this  floor here with pictures of iconic American goods, such as York Peppermint  Patties, Radio Flyer red wagons, Fig  Newton cookies, and Huffy bicycles, to  highlight the fact that the production  of these American classic products had  moved to Mexico, to China, and elsewhere. On dozens, if not hundreds, of  occasions, Senator Dorgan spoke passionately on this floor about the decline of American manufacturing. I am  grateful to his leadership on this critical issue and for bringing our attention to an unfair tax advantage that  rewards companies for moving manufacturing jobs overseas.  Last year, a version of Senator Dorgan’s bill was included in the Creating  American Jobs and Ending Offshoring  Act. While a majority of this body—53  Senators—voted to begin debate on the  bill, we were not able to overcome a filibuster to have a chance to consider  and pass this legislation. I am sorry we  were not able to pass the bill last year,  and I will do my best to bring it up for  a vote in this new Congress.

149,139,2011-01-25,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, nearly 16  years ago I stood before you to introduce a bill ‘‘to provide an opportunity  for the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada  to have  the merits of  their claims  against the United States determined  by the United States Court of Federal  Claims.’’  That bill was introduced as Senate  Resolution  223, which  referred  the  Pottawatomi’s  claim  to  the  Chief  Judge of the U.S. Court of Federal  Claims and required the Chief Judge to  report back to the Senate and provide  sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable the Congress to  determine whether the claim of the  Pottawatomi Nation in Canada is legal  or equitable in nature, and the amount  of damages, if any, which may be legally or equitably due from the United  States.  Over a decade ago, the Chief Judge of  the Court of Federal Claims reported  back that the Pottawatomi Nation in  Canada has a legitimate and credible  legal claim. Thereafter, by settlement  stipulation,  the United  States  has  taken the position that  it would be  ‘‘fair, just and equitable’’ to settle the  claims of the  ottawatomi Nation in Canada for the  sum  of  $1,830,000.  This  settlement  amount was  reached by  the parties  after seven years of extensive, fact-intensive litigation. Independently, the  court concluded that the settlement  amount is ‘‘not a gratuity’’ and that  the  ‘‘settlement was predicated on a  credible legal claim.’’ Pottawatomi Nation in Canada, et al. v. United States,  Cong. Ref. 94–1037X at 28, Ct. Fed. Cl.,  September 15, 2000, Report of Hearing  Officer.  The bill I introduce today is to authorize  the  appropriation  of  those  funds that the United States has concluded would be ‘‘fair, just and equitable’’ to satisfy this legal claim. If enacted, this bill will finally achieve a  measure of justice for a tribal nation  that has for far too long been denied.  For  the  information  of  our  colleagues, this  is the historical background  that  informs  the underlying  legal  claim  of  the  Canadian  Pottawatomi.  The members of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada are one of the descendant  groups—successors-in-interest—of  the historical Pottawatomi Nation and  their claim originates  in  the  latter  part of the 18th century. The historical  Pottawatomi Nation was aboriginal to  the United States. They occupied and  possessed a vast expanse in what is now  the States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana,  Illinois, and Wisconsin. From 1795 to  1833, the United States annexed most of  the  traditional  land  of  the  Pottawatomi Nation through a series  of treaties of cession—many of these  cessions were made under extreme duress and the threat of military action.  In exchange, the Pottawatomi were repeatedly made promises that the remainder of their lands would be secure  and,  in  addition,  that  the United  States would pay certain annuities to  the Pottawatomi.  In 1829, the United States formally  adopted a Federal the policy of removal; an effort to remove all Indian  tribes from their traditional lands east  of the Mississippi River to the west. As  part of that effort, the government increasingly pressured the Pottawatomi  to cede the remainder of their traditional lands, some five million acres in  and around the city of Chicago, and remove their nation west. For years, the  Pottawatomi  steadfastly  refused  to  cede the remainder of their tribal territory. Then in 1833, the United States,  pressed by settlers seeking more land,  sent  a Treaty Commission  to  the  Pottawatomi with orders to extract a  cession of the remaining  lands. The  Treaty Commissioners spent 2 weeks  using  extraordinarily  coercive  tactics—including threats of war—in an  attempt to get the Pottawatomi to  agree to cede their territory. Finally,  those Pottawatomi who were present  relented and on September 26, 1933,  they ceded their remaining tribal estate through what would be known as  the Treaty of Chicago. Seventy-seven  members of the Pottawatomi Nation  signed the Treaty of Chicago. Members  of  the  ‘‘Wisconsin Band’’ were not  present and did not assent to the cession.  In exchange for their land, the Treaty of Chicago provided that the United  States would give to the Pottawatomi  5 million acres of comparable land in  what  is  now  Missouri.  The  Pottawatomi were  familiar with the  Missouri land, aware that it was similar to their homeland. However, the  Senate  refused  to  ratify  that negotiated  agreement  and  unilaterally  switched the land to five million acres  in  Iowa. The Treaty Commissioners  were sent back to acquire Pottawatomi  assent to the Iowa land. All but seven  of the original 77 signatories refused to  accept the change even with promises  that if they were dissatisfied ‘‘justice  would be done.’’  Nevertheless, the Treaty of Chicago  was ratified as amended by the Senate  in 1834. Subsequently, the Pottawatomi  sent a delegation to evaluate the land  in Iowa. The delegation reported back  that the land was ‘‘not fit for snakes to  live on.’’  While  some  Pottawatomi moved  westward, many of the Pottawatomi,  particularly the Wisconsin Band, whose  leaders never agreed to the Treaty, refused to do so. By 1836, the United  States  began  to  forcefully  remove  Pottawatomi who remained in the east  with devastating consequences. As is  true with many other American Indian  tribes,  the  forced  removal westward  came at great human cost. Many of the  Pottawatomi were forcefully removed  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:47 Aug 19, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S25JA1.REC S25JA1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

151,146,2011-01-25,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, I rise to  introduce a bill to reauthorize Title  VIII of the Native American Housing  Assistance  and  Self-Determination  Act. Title VIII provides authority for  the appropriation of funds for the construction of  low-income housing  for  Native Hawaiians and further provides  authority for access to loan guarantees  associated with  the  construction of  housing to serve Native Hawaiians.  Three studies have documented the  acute housing needs of Native Hawaiians—which include the highest rates  of overcrowding and homelessness in  the State of Hawaii. Those same studies  indicate that  inadequate housing  rates  for  Native  Hawaiians  are  amongst the highest in the Nation.  The reauthorization of Title VIII will  support the continuation of efforts to  assure that the native people of Hawaii  may one day have access to housing opportunities  that  are  comparable  to  those now enjoyed by other Americans.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 65  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

152,146,2011-01-25,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, today I  am reintroducing a bill which  is of  great importance to a group of patriotic Americans. This legislation is designed  to end  space-available  travel  privileges on military aircraft to those  who have been totally disabled in the  service of our country.  Currently,  retired members of  the  Armed Services are permitted to travel  on  a  space-available  basis  on non-  scheduled military flights within the  continental United  States,  and  on  scheduled overseas flights operated by  the Military Airlift Command. My bill  would provide the same benefits  for  veterans with 100 percent service-connected disabilities.  We owe these heroic men and women  who have given so much to our country  a debt of gratitude. Of course, we can  never  repay  them  for  the  sacrifices  they have made on behalf of our Nation, but we can surely try to make  their lives more pleasant and fulfilling.  One way in which we can help is to extend military travel privileges to these  distinguished American  veterans.  I  have received numerous  letters  from  all over the country attesting to the  importance attached to this issue by  veterans. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues show their concern and join me  in saying ‘‘thank you’’ by supporting  this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 67  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. TRAVEL ON MILITARY AIRCRAFT OF  CERTAIN DISABLED FORMER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.  (a) INGENERAL.—Chapter 53 of title 10,  United States Code, is amended by inserting  after section 1060b the following new section:  ‘‘§1060c.

The Secretary of Defense shall permit such travel on  a space-available basis.’’.

153,146,2011-01-25,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, today I  am reintroducing legislation to enable  those former prisoners of war who have  been separated honorably  from their  respective services and who have been  rated as having a 30 percent service-  connected disability to have the use of  both the military commissary and post  exchange privileges. While I realize it  is impossible to adequately compensate  one who has endured long periods of incarceration at the hands of our Nation’s enemies, I do feel this gesture is  both meaningful  and  important  to  those concerned because it serves as a  reminder that our nation has not forgotten their sacrifices.

154,153,2011-01-25,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr.  President, I rise on behalf of myself  and Senator BOXERto introduce legislation to further the restoration of the  San Francisco Bay.  There are many areas in the country  in which restoration is done, and I am  pleased to introduce an authorization  for restoration work in the San Francisco Bay with Senator BOXER, Chairwoman of the Senate Environment and  Public Works Committee. Companion  legislation will also be introduced in  the U.S. House of Representatives by  Congresswoman JACKIESPEIER.  As Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment,  and Related Agencies,  I secured $17  million  in Federal  funding  for ecosystem restoration and water quality  work in the San Francisco Bay in the  last three years. I also secured $15 million since 2006 for the Fish and Wildlife  Service to restore salt ponds to tidal  wetlands in the Bay.  It is necessary to ensure that these  funds continue to be appropriated and  are  spent  on  the most  important  projects for the ecosystem and public  benefit.  To  that end,  this  legislation will  prioritize funding for projects that will  protect  and  restore  vital  estuarine  habitat  for  migratory  waterfowl,  shorebirds, and wildlife; improve and  restore water quality and rearing habitat for fish; and ensure public benefits.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.

155,160,2011-01-25,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I am  proud today to introduce the Criminal  Justice and Forensic Science Reform  Act of 2011. This legislation is an important first step toward guaranteeing  the effectiveness and scientific integrity of forensic evidence used in criminal cases, and in ensuring that Americans can have faith in their criminal  justice system.  In March of 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee began its examination  of serious  issues concerning  forensic  science, which is at the heart of our  criminal  justice  system. The Committee has studied the problem exhaustively, and has worked with a wide  array of experts and stakeholders. The  legislation I introduce today is a product  of  this  process.  It  seeks  to  strengthen our confidence in the criminal justice system, and the evidence it  relies upon, by ensuring that forensic  evidence and testimony  is accurate,  credible, and scientifically grounded.  The National Academy of Science  published a report in February 2009 asserting  that  the  field  of  forensic  science has significant problems that  urgently need to be addressed. The report suggested that basic research establishing  the  scientific validity of  many forensic science disciplines has  never been done  in a comprehensive  way.  It  suggested  that  the  forensic  sciences lack uniform and unassailable  standards governing the accreditation  of laboratories, the certification of forensic practitioners, and the testing  and analysis of evidence.  The National Academy of Science’s  report was an urgent call to action. It  has been hailed and widely cited since  its release. It has also been criticized  by many. I did not view the Academy’s  report as the final word on this issue,  but rather as the starting point for a  searching review of the state of forensic science in this country.  Last Congress, the Judiciary Committee held two hearings on the issue.  Committee members and staff spent  countless hours talking to prosecutors,  defense attorneys, law enforcement officers,  judges,  forensic practitioners,  academic  experts, and many, many  others to learn as much as we could  about what is happening in the forensic  sciences and what needs to be done.  As this effort has progressed, I have  been disturbed  to  learn about  still  more cases in which innocent people  may have been convicted, and perhaps  even executed, in part due to faulty forensic evidence. It is a double tragedy  when an innocent person is convicted.  An  innocent  person  suffers,  and  a  guilty person remains free, leaving us  all less safe. We must do everything we  can to avoid that untenable outcome.  At the same time, through the course  of this inquiry, it has become abundantly clear that the men and women  who test and analyze forensic evidence  do tremendous work that is vital to  our criminal justice system. I remember their important contributions and  hard work from my days as a prosecutor, when some of the forensic disciplines we have now did not even  exist. Their work is even more important today, and we need to strengthen  the field of forensics—and the justice  system’s confidence in it—so that their  hard work can be consistently relied  upon, as it should be.  It is beyond question that everyone  recognizes the need  for  forensic evidence that  is accurate and reliable.  Prosecutors and law enforcement officers want evidence that can be relied  upon to determine guilt and prove it  beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of  law. Defense attorneys want  strong  evidence that can be used to exclude  innocent people from suspicion. Forensic  science practitioners want  their  work to have as much certainty as possible and to be given deserved deference. All scientists and all attorneys  who care about these issues want the  science that is admitted as evidence in  the courtroom to match the science  that is proven through rigorous testing  and research in the laboratory.  There is also general agreement that  the forensic sciences can be improved  through  strong and unassailable  research to test and establish the validity of the forensic disciplines, as well  as the application of consistent and  regular standards in the field. There is  a dire need for well managed and appropriately directed  funding  for  research,  development,  training,  and  technical assistance. It is a good investment, as it will lead to fewer trials  and appeals, and will reduce crime by  ensuring that those who commit serious offenses are promptly captured and  convicted.  There is also broad consensus that all  forensic  laboratories  should  be  required to meet rigorous accreditation  standards  and  that  forensic  practitioners should be required to obtain  meaningful certification.  The bill I introduce today seeks to  address these widely recognized needs.  It requires that all forensic science laboratories that receive Federal funding  or Federal business be accredited according to rigorous standards. It requires all relevant personnel who perform forensic work for any laboratory  or agency that gets Federal money to  become certified in their fields, which  will mean meeting basic proficiency,  education, and training requirements.  The bill sets up a rigorous process to  determine the most serious needs for  research to establish the basic validity  of the forensic disciplines, and establishes grant programs to provide for  peer-reviewed scientific research to answer fundamental questions and promote innovation. It also sets up a process for this research to lead to appropriate standards and best practices in  each discipline. The bill funds research  into new technologies and techniques  that will allow forensic testing to be  done more quickly, more efficiently,  and more accurately. I believe these  are proposals that will be widely supported by those on all sides of this  issue.  There have been of course some areas  of disagreement, particularly as to who  should oversee these vital reforms to  the field of forensics. Some have argued that, because the purpose of forensic science is primarily to produce  evidence to be used in the investigation  and prosecution of criminal cases, it is  vital that those regulating and evaluating forensics must have expertise in  criminal justice. They have said that  at the Federal level, the Department of  Justice is the natural place for an office to examine and oversee the forensic sciences and have emphasized the  need for forensic science practitioners  to have substantial input in evaluating  research and standards.  Others have argued that, for forensic  science to truly engender our trust and  confidence, its validity must be established by  independent  scientific  research, and standards must be determined by scientists with no possible  conflict of interest. They have argued  for protections to ensure independent  scientific decision making, as well as  the significant involvement of Federal  scientific agencies.

156,188,2011-01-25,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, Senator BAUCUS and I first introduced a  bill to ban patents for tax inventions in  the 110th Congress. Since then, we have  worked with the leaders of the Judiciary Committee, the Patent and Trademark Office, the American Institute of  Certified Public Accountants, industry,  and members of the patent bar to perfect the language. I am pleased to introduce  this new and  improved bill  today with Senators BAUCUS, LEVIN,  WYDEN, BINGAMAN, CONRAD, ENZI, and  KERRY.  There are strong policy reasons to  ban tax strategy patents. Tax strategy  patents may lead to the marketing of  aggressive  tax  shelters or otherwise  mislead taxpayers about expected results. Tax strategy patents encumber  the ability of taxpayers and their advisers to use the tax law freely, interfering with the voluntary tax compliance system. If  firms or  individuals  were able to hold patents  for these  strategies, some taxpayers could face  fees simply for complying with the Tax  Code. And, tax patents provide windfalls to lawyers and patent holders by  granting them exclusive rights to use  tax  loopholes, which  could  provide  some businesses with an unfair advantage.  Tax strategy patents are unlikely to  be novel given the public nature of the  Tax Code. Moreover, tax strategy patents may undermine the fairness of the  Federal tax system by removing from  the public domain particular ways of  satisfying a  taxpayer’s  legal obligations. The Equal Access to Tax Planning Act  expressly provides  that a  strategy for reducing, avoiding or deferring tax liability cannot be considered a new or nonobvious  idea, and  therefore, a patent on a tax strategy  cannot be obtained. This ensures that  all taxpayers will have equal access to  strategies  to  comply with  the Tax  Code. I encourage support for this bill.  By Mr. KIRK (for himself and Mr.  DURBIN):  S. 147. A bill to amend the Federal  Water Pollution Control Act to establish a deadline for restricting sewage  dumping into the Great Lakes and to  fund programs and activities for improving wastewater discharges into the  Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  ",2011
157,188,2011-01-25,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. President, today I am  pleased to join with Senator DURBINto  introduce the Great Lakes Water Protection Act. This bipartisan legislation  would set a date certain to end sewage  dumping in America’s largest supply of  fresh water, the Great Lakes. More  than thirty million Americans depend  on the Great Lakes for their drinking  water, food, jobs, and recreation. We  need to put a stop to the poisoning of  our water  supply. Cities along  the  Great Lakes must become  environmental stewards of our country’s most  precious freshwater ecosystem.  The Great Lakes Water Protection  Act gives cities until 2031 to build the  full infrastructure needed to prevent  sewage dumping into the Great Lakes.  Those who violate EPA sewage dumping regulations after that federal deadline will be  subject  to  fines up  to  $100,000 for each day a violation occurs.  These fines will be directed to a newly  established Great Lakes Clean-Up Fund  within the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. Penalties collected would go  into this fund and be reallocated to the  states surrounding the Great Lakes.  From there, the funds will be spent on  wastewater treatment options, with a  special focus on greener solutions such  as habitat protection and wetland restoration.  This  legislation  is  sorely needed.  Many major cities along  the Great  Lakes do not have the infrastructure  needed to divert sewage overflows during times of heavy rainfall. More than  twenty-four billion gallons of sewage  are dumped into the Lakes each year;  Detroit alone dumps an estimated 13  billion gallons of sewage into the Great  Lakes annually. EPA estimates show  there is a total of 347 combined sewer  outflows that discharge into the Lake  Michigan basin alone. This development is echoed throughout the Great  Lakes region and is one we need to reverse.  These disastrous practices result in  thousands of annual beach closing for  the region’s 815 freshwater beaches. Illinois faced 628 beach closures or contamination advisories in 2009 alone, up  17 percent from 2008. This greatly affects the health of our children and  families—a recent University of Chicago study showed swim bans at Chicago’s beaches due to E. coli levels cost  the local economy $2.4 million in lost  revenue every year.  Protecting our Great Lakes is one of  my top priorities in the Congress. As  an original sponsor of the Great Lakes  Restoration Act, I favor a broad approach to addressing needs in the region. However, we must also move forward with tailored approaches to fix  specific problems as we continue to  push for more comprehensive reform. I  am proud to introduce this important  legislation that addresses a key problem facing our Great Lakes, and hope  my colleagues will support me in ensuring that these important resources  become free from the threat of sewage  pollution.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 147  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

158,195,2011-01-25,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President,  the  Healthy  Lifestyles  and  Prevention  America Act, also known as the HeLP  America Act, will improve the health  of Americans and reduce health care  costs  by  emphasizing  prevention,  wellness, and health promotion in our  communities, workplaces and schools.  We made a significant investment in  prevention and wellness as part of the  passing of the historic Affordable Care  Act into law. The robust array of provisions contained in the HeLP America  Act continue to build off the investments made by the Affordable Care Act  and together, they will significantly  transform our current sick care system  into a true health care system.  Make no mistake about  it;  these  combined  efforts will  continue  our  transformation into a genuine wellness  society by keeping people from developing chronic diseases and from costly  hospitalizations in the first place.  Currently, the United States spends  more than $2 trillion on health care  each year but historically we invest  just four cents out of every dollar in  prevention and public health—let me  repeat  that—just  four  cents out of  every dollar is invested in prevention  and public health.  This  is pennies despite all the research that shows that prevention and  public health can effectively  reduce  health care spending. This  is why I  fought for the Prevention and Public  Health Fund that is included in the  health reform law.  But transforming our Nation into a  true wellness society requires a comprehensive approach  to make being  healthier easier for all Americans.  It just doesn’t make any sense why  we don’t put a greater emphasis on  making health promotion easier—why  would we focus so little on prevention  and public health when we know that  these initiatives can make us healthier  and  reduce our annual health  care  spending?  Well, I am proud that the bill before  the Senate continues to make significant  investments  in prevention and  wellness. The HeLP America Act will  put additional systems into place that  will improve access to nutritious foods,  opportunities for physical activity, and  affordability of recommended preventive services.  The bill  focuses on  initiatives  to  make kids and schools healthier. In  particular, it will support State efforts  to provide resources to child care providers to help them meet high-quality  physical activity and healthy eating  standards. It also directs the Department of Education to provide guidance  and technical assistance to schools to  provide equal opportunities  for  students with disabilities for physical education and extracurricular athletics.  In addition, the bill focuses on initiatives to make healthier communities  and workplaces. For example,  it requires  the Secretary of Health and  Human Services to establish guidelines  in physical activity for children under  the age of 5 and the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a grant program  promoting and  expanding  efforts  to  create community gardens. Specific to  small  businesses  and  workplace  wellness programs, there is a provision  that allows employers to deduct the  cost of athletic facility memberships  for their employees and exempts this  benefit as taxable income for employees.  The HeLP America Act also creates  systems that give Americans the information they need to make informed decisions. In particular, there is a provision that requires uniform guidelines  be developed for the use of nutrient labeling symbols or systems on the front  of food packages. There are provisions  meant to strengthen federal initiatives  to improve the health literacy of consumers by making health information  easier to understand and health care  systems easier to navigate.  Let me be clear, this bill doesn’t just  tinker around the edges; it changes the  very paradigm of a variety of systems  to make it easier for Americans to be  healthy. After many years of advocating for wellness and prevention, I  am thrilled to see that these things  were at the very heart of the historic  Affordable Care Act passed into law.  But there  is still much more to be  done, and the HeLP America Act is an  important  step  in  continuing  our  transformation into a genuine wellness  society and getting health care costs  under control.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.

160,216,2011-01-25,Mr. TURNER.," Mr. Speaker, I am proud to  recognize a member of  the General Daniel  ‘‘Chappie’’ James American Legion Auxiliary  Post 776, located in my congressional district  in Riverside, Ohio,  for  the service she has  given to her community.  On November 6, 2010, Ms. Juanita Bradley  was honored as the ‘‘Woman of the Year’’ in  Dayton, Ohio,  for her  lifetime of work and  dedication to assist needy families in Dayton  and the surrounding communities.  Ms. Bradley is the founder and chairman of  the American Legion Post 776 ‘‘Needy Family  Committee’’ which has provided holiday food  baskets to needy families in Dayton for over  25 years. Under Ms. Bradley’s guidance and  leadership,  the number of  families  receiving  food baskets has grown from 12 to 60 families. These baskets, which are delivered on  the third Saturday in December, are the size  of a large laundry basket, and are filled with  a variety of perishable and non-perishable  items.  Ms. Bradley and her committee also serve  hot meals to a homeless residence at the St.  Vincent Hotel on a monthly basis. Most of the  meals served are cooked by Ms. Bradley herself.  Ms. Bradley is also the Chair of ‘‘Make a  Difference Day,’’ which  for  two years has  ‘‘adopted’’  the children of service men and  women who have been deployed overseas.  The event offers an alternative to trick-or-treating by hosting a Halloween party where kids  can enjoy pizza, sodas, and other treats in a  safe and fun environment. Last year, the event  also provided  the children with phone cards  that could be used to call their parents during  the holidays.  The American Legion Auxiliary is the world’s  largest, nonprofit patriotic women’s service organization whose members do volunteer work  for a multitude of worthwhile causes that benefit America’s veterans, children and communities.  It  is my pleasure  to congratulate Ms.  Juanita Bradley for her receipt of the ‘‘Woman  of the Year’’ award in Dayton, Ohio.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF MS.

After 14 years as District Representative in my  Worcester Congressional Office, Paula is retiring to spend more time with her family and especially her beautiful baby granddaughter, Abigail.  Paula  joined my Worcester office early  in  my first term in 1997. Since that time she has  exhibited consistent excellence and shown a  thoughtful and compassionate hand  in all of  her work. She has been  tireless  in her approach with constituents, always welcoming  and personable, a model of patient kindness.  Most of all, Paula has been a delight to work  with  these many years, and  I know  that  I  speak not only for myself, but for my entire  staff when I say that we will all miss her dearly.  It is bittersweet to say goodbye to a beloved  and loyal colleague, but I know that Paula will  remain  involved  in many other  important efforts,  including her work at  the Worcester  County Food Bank, where she serves on the  board, and her church, St. Matthew’s Parish of  Worcester. Whatever projects or ventures she  takes on, I am confident that Paula will continue to make a positive difference in her community.  Mr. Speaker,  I am sure  that  the United  States House of Representatives joins me in  recognizing Ms. Paula Buonomo for her many  years of dedicated public service to the constituents of the Massachusetts Third Congressional District, and for the indispensable role  she has played as one of my most trusted and  valued staff members. I wish her only the best  in all of her future endeavors.  HONORING RYAN JACOB ROBERTS  HON. SAM GRAVES  OFMISSOURI  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 25, 2011  ",2011

167,6,2011-01-31,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President, this past  Friday marked the annual Earned-Income Tax Credit Awareness Day. I rise  to recognize the success and  importance of this vital tax benefit for hard-  working Americans.  As our country continues its steady  recovery from the worst economic conditions hard-working American men  and women have faced since the Great  Depression, families need financial relief and many people need jobs.  As we renew our efforts to promote  job creation, increase access to credit  for small businesses, and restore confidence and stability to markets, we  should not forget that we already have  what one President once called  ‘‘the  best anti-poverty, the best pro-family,  the best job-creation measure to come  out of Congress.’’ President Ronald  Reagan was talking about the earned-  income tax credit.  Since 1975, the EITC has helped to  offset the  impact of Social Security  taxes for low- and moderate-income individuals. Nearly 26 million taxpayers  across the country received the EITC  when they filed their tax returns last  year. In Hawaii alone, over 100,000 low-  and middle-income workers received an  average of nearly $2,000 for this tremendous tax benefit. These vital EITC  resources help families pay for essentials such as food, housing, clothing,  transportation,  and  education  expenses.  The earned-income tax credit is more  important now than ever before. With  many Americans  still out of work,  some families accustomed to budgeting  based on the earnings of two people are  struggling to survive on the income of  one. Some people in Hawaii and across  the  country who are working new,  lower paying jobs may be eligible for  the earned-income tax credit for the  first time.  To be clear, every taxpayer who receives the EITC is hard working because the earned-income tax credit is  only provided to Americans who work  for a living. The EITC encourages individuals to  find work, support themselves and their families, and improve  their quality of life.  A few years ago, only one in five taxpayers eligible for the EITC claimed  their benefits. Since then, tremendous  progress has been made. The number  has risen to four in five, thanks in part  to the tireless work of taxpayer consumer advisers and advocates in our  communities.  Our goal now should be to see to it  that all eligible taxpayers claim their  EITC benefits this year. That would  mean in Hawaii alone about 34,000 more  taxpayers would receive much needed  financial relief, with similar results  across the country.  I plan to reintroduce the Taxpayer  Abuse Prevention Act  in  this  112th  Congress. My bill is intended to protect  low- and middle-income taxpayers from  falling victim to unscrupulous lenders.  Historically, many EITC  recipients  have turned to predatory refund anticipation  loans which  are  short-term  loans typically carrying steep interest  rates. Working families cannot afford  to lose a significant portion of their  EITC  to  these expensive  short-term  predatory  loans. My bill will better  protect  consumers  from  predatory  lenders that prey on the EITC benefits  of low-income taxpayers, and I urge my  colleagues to support it when the bill  comes to the floor. In today’s economy  every penny counts, and the value of  the earned income tax credit is magnified.  I look forward to working with my  colleagues to better educate, protect,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:32 Feb 01, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G31JA6.009 S31JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011
168,13,2011-01-31,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President. I  rise  today  with  Senators  WEBB,  BENNELSON, and CONRAD to introduce  the EPA Regulations Suspension Act of  2011. We are introducing this legislation for a simple but enormously important reason. At a time when our  economy is finally headed toward a recovery, the last thing we want to do is  add new burdens to American companies that could result in them cutting  jobs or being  less productive  in the  global marketplace.  In fact, I believe that the fate of our  entire economy, our wide and varied  manufacturing  industries  and  our  workers, especially our coal workers,  rests in part on the decisions we make  here  in Washington. One  thing we  should never do is put the fate of an entire industry into the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency.  My legislation is simple and reasonable. It requires that for 2 years the  EPA can take no regulatory action, regarding carbon dioxide and methane  emission from stationary sources. During that time no facility can be subjected to any requirement to obtain a  permit or meet a New Source Performance Standard under the Clean Air Act  with respect to carbon dioxide or methane. At the same time the legislation  specifically allows for the widely-supported motor vehicle emission standards to continue moving forward.  At the beginning of this year regulations came into effect that say if a  company wants to retrofit an existing  or build a new power plant, or factory,  they now have to find ways to reduce  their greenhouse gas emissions.  Later this year the EPA will propose  expanding these rules to cover existing  stationary sources that are not expanding their operations. The  impact of  these rules is that companies will sit  on the sidelines and opportunities for  innovation and  job creation will be  lost. Because of these new rules companies won’t build that new factory. They  won’t build that new power plant. And  so they won’t employ some of the millions of Americans who are out of  work. That is why I believe these regulations need to be suspended.  I want to make one thing perfectly  clear. I believe that climate change is  an  important  issue  and  Congress  should and will address it working collaboratively with the administration  and the private sector.  But the lead should come from Congress and not the EPA. Congress, unlike the EPA, can craft proposals that  reduce greenhouse gases while simultaneously protecting our economy. Most  importantly, Congress is directly accountable to the people whose lives we  impact.  We are capable of tackling this great  challenge in a way that supports rather  than undermines our economy and our  future.  But the process has to work. It has to  be open. It has to be truly bipartisan.  It has to acknowledge the fact that all  of our States use energy in very different ways. It has to protect our economy. This will not be achieved overnight, but it is possible.  Technology can be a solution to this  problem. West Virginia  is poised to  lead the effort on clean energy technology: because we know energy. We  know coal. We know natural gas. We  know Carbon Capture and Storage or  CCS as few others do. We are coming to  know wind and we have great potential  in learning how to use our geothermal  resources as well.  The fact is, we in West Virginia know  and embrace what too many others either don’t understand or refuse to see,  which is that our Nation and countries  around  the world are dependent on  coal. That is not something that will  change when half the globe is struggling to rise out of poverty.  In this country we get almost half  our electricity from coal. That will not  change anytime soon. Globally countries such as China and India continue  to increase their usage of coal as they  develop their economies.  To fight climate change we can’t just  choose to stop using coal. Even if we in  the United States did, the rest of the  world wouldn’t; and the problem would  continue.  Instead we must  find  the  technological solution that allows us  to use coal, while reducing its impact  on the Earth and her people.  I know that there are many on the  Republican side of the aisle who believe it does not go far enough. There  are many on my side of the aisle who  believe  it goes too  far  in tying the  EPA’s hands. Ultimately I believe this  is good  legislation because  it  is an  achievable compromise. Too often in  this body we seek to score political  points on issues rather than solve problems that the country is facing now.  And right now our Nation’s manufacturing and industrial sectors are facing  the prospect of overwhelming EPA regulation. Regulation  that makes  it  harder for them to put America back  to work. While many might think this  is not the perfect solution it is a solution that I believe we can and should  move early this year.  One piece of the debate that is often  missing in our discussions is to keep  our focus on people and all the problems, including the problem of climate  change, that affect their future.  My focus is on protecting the hard-  working people I represent—people who  changed my life when I was born anew  in the coalfields of West Virginia at  the age of 26. These people, their work  and their lives matter. Any regulatory  solution that creates more problems  for them than it fixes; and causes more  harm than good in their lives is no solution at all. EPA regulation of greenhouse gases does just that.  So that, Mr. President, is why I have  introduced  this  legislation  today.  I  hope that this body will act on  it  quickly, for we do not have time to  waste. I yield the floor.  By Mr. LEVIN:  S. 232. A bill to amend the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the  manufacturer limitation on the number of new qualified plug-in electric  drive motor vehicles eligible for credit;  to the Committee on Finance.  ",2011
169,13,2011-01-31,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing legislation that is an  important step for the competitiveness  of U.S. manufacturing by continuing  the nurturing of the market for the  next generation of electric vehicles.  This bill will continue the availability  of the $7,500 consumer tax credit for  plug-in hybrid vehicles. Current  law  limits the availability of this plug-in  hybrid tax credit to the first 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer, which is too  small  to  support  the  revolutionary  technological change that we are hopefully going to witness. Failure to provide this support risks falling short of  President Obama’s important goal of  putting 1 million electric vehicles on  the road by 2015.  The U.S. auto industry is poised for a  technological explosion that promises  to  fundamentally  change  transportation here and around the world. Already, the success of GM’s Volt has  demonstrated that electric vehicles are  not  just an  engineer’s dream or a  science  fiction story. They are real,  and there is plenty more innovation  ready to be unleashed.  But  like  almost  every  transformational technology, from the great  railroads to the Internet, this technological revolution needs support if it is  to spread. President Obama last week  laid out a vision of how this kind of  technology can help ensure our economic future. With the proper support,  we can transform transportation and  create new jobs for American workers.  But if we fail to support this revolution, we risk missing an opportunity  that we may never get back. If we do  not get it right, there is no doubt that  other countries will—and their workers—in China, India, South Korea and  elsewhere—will then build these vehicles instead of American workers.  So I am pleased today to be introducing this bill that is identical to one  that my brother SANDYLEVIN introduced last week in the House of Representatives. This legislation will increase the cap on the number of vehicles eligible for the plug-in hybrid tax  credit in current law and provide much  greater certainty to our manufacturers. It says to our manufacturers that  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:38 Feb 01, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A31JA6.012 S31JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

184,5,2011-02-11,Mr. POE of Texas.," It’s expensive regulation  that makes no  sense. Why  should all this paperwork be sent up to  Washington so bureaucrats can review  it?  I don’t understand the  logic.  It  makes no sense. It costs money.  But the bill also requires 16,000 new  IRS agents to oversee the individual  mandate requirement that every person must comply with. I think that  mandate is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court will eventually decide.  But why do we need 16,000 new IRS regulation agents under the health care  bill?  I  think  that’s  overregulation.  And, in fact, the Congressional Budget  Office, as my friend, the chairman from  Texas, said, Director Elmendorf yesterday testified that the health care bill  will cost 800,000 jobs for Americans. He  said that yesterday. So the bill is not  going to help the economy. It’s not  going to help get jobs. It’s going to  cost us 800,000 jobs.  These are some reasons why I think  Congress has the obligation to review  the regulatory process and to get our  house in order and probably eliminate  a few of those 300,000 expensive regulations that are imposed upon businesses  and on citizens.  And that’s just the way it is.  b0940  ",2011
185,5,2011-02-11,Mr. CONYERS.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  In the time allotted to the Judiciary  Committee, Judge POE, if he is still  here, has raised two specific grievances  about overregulation diminishing  job  opportunity. One was on the 1099 form,  which I am going to examine more  carefully; and the other was about the  fact that the Health Care Reform Act  frequently, derogatorily, is referred to  as the ObamaCare Act, but which I call  the ObamaCare Act because I think it’s  going to go down in history as a major  accomplishment  of  the  President’s  within the first 2 years of his office.  He said it would cost 800,000 jobs. I  would like to ask him or anyone in the  House for any evidence that there is an  800,000 jobs expense. The health care  bill  that  both  sides  refer  to  as  ObamaCare now creates jobs because  we’re adding many more people to the  health care system, which, ladies and  gentlemen,  is going to require more  doctors, more nurses, more  clinics,  more hospitals.  How on Earth can we expand the provisions of health care, which incidentally should apply to every American  in this country, and then say that it’s  going to reduce the number of jobs?  I think that logic defies explanation,  but  I would yield  to anybody who  would like to explain it to me.  ",2011

188,5,2011-02-11,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," I thank my  friend, the ranking member, for yielding.  The source of the information that I  have used and that Judge POEhas used  in saying that the health care bill is  going to cost 800,000 jobs is from a report released yesterday by the Congressional Budget Office, saying that the  health care bill would cost 800,000 jobs.  The CBO, as we all know, is an independent, credible, outside agency upon  whom we rely for information on a regular basis. For them to come out and  say that the health care bill is going to  cost 800,000 jobs is, quite frankly, believable and the reason, I think, we can  cite them as a credible source.  ",2011
189,5,2011-02-11,Mr. CONYERS.," Reclaiming my time,  I frequently cite them as a credible  source myself; but would the chairman  of the committee explain how we insure millions more people and then  have fewer and fewer jobs?  Did the CBO explain anything about  this job loss and about how the health  care system would be considerably expanded but would at the same time lose  jobs and would do it with fewer people?  Would the chairman of the committee  assist me in understanding that apparent disconnect?  I yield to the gentleman.  ",2011
190,5,2011-02-11,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," I can’t explain  the disconnect because I don’t think  there is a disconnect.  We can certainly supply you with the  testimony that was offered by the CBO  yesterday in which they said it would  cost 800,000 jobs. We’ll look for a copy  of that testimony, or the other Judiciary staff members might be able to  supply us with a copy of that as well.  I don’t think there is a disconnect. I  believe the CBO. I do believe that the  health care bill is going to cost 800,000  jobs.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",2011

Madam Speaker, this is part of a 7- or  9-hour marathon for committees of jurisdiction to come to the floor to respond to how important it is to, in essence,  clog  up  the  government.  It  sounds pretty, and it sounds attractive  to be able to suggest that we have not  been exercising due diligence as relates  to the regulatory process of the executive branch.  My colleague  from Tennessee was  right: when we cite the Constitution,  what we are saying is that the Founding Fathers recognized the importance  of three distinct branches:  The legislative writes legislation. It  has the right to oversight, and those  who are part of this body are elected to  represent certain perspectives.  The executive is elected by all of the  people, electing the President of the  United States.  The third branch, the judiciary, has  oversight.  So what we have taken to the floor  to do is to spend 9 hours in redundancy,  talking about what this body should be  doing anyhow. We have the responsibility of oversight. We have the ability  to  question  regulations  in  regular  order; but what we will be doing is ignoring the people’s business of creating  jobs and, frankly, putting ourselves in  the role of a clogged toilet, meaning  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:39 Feb 11, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11FE7.024 H11FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

I think we all agree that quality education is important, and I rise today to  discuss a regulation that will unduly  burden our schools and communities.  Last October,  the Department  of  Education released the Program Integrity regulations. Many educators fear  that  these  regulations will have  a  broad reach and require programs to be  licensed in each State where students  reside. Let met give you an example of  a small university in a small county in  Ohio, Pickaway County. This county  lost 2,500 jobs and only has an 11 percent baccalaureate rate.  OCU created an online degree program which currently has 1,000 students enrolled from 15 States. In addition to educating these students, OCU  has created over 150 jobs in 5 years. If  required to be licensed in all 15 States,  OCU will be forced to unenroll at least  half of the online students and lay off  staff. If implemented improperly, this  regulation would impact smaller colleges and universities  like OCU who  don’t have the resources to comply  with this heavy burden.  ",2011

We’ve heard examples here  today,  and we’ll hear more this afternoon, of  how this blizzard of regulations is getting in the way of that job creation and  preventing Americans  from  getting  back to work.

200,12,2011-02-11,Mr. LUCAS.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to claim the Agriculture Committee’s time, which I believe I am  sharing with my colleague from Minnesota, and I yield myself 5 minutes.  Today, American agriculture is under  attack. Every day, the administration  seems to demonstrate just how vastly  disconnected it is from the folks who  feed us. The administration fails to realize that rural America’s economy is  dependent upon agriculture. The  in-  your-face approach that the administration has taken regarding government regulation has increased the cost  of doing business for America’s farmers  and ranchers. If the administration is  allowed to continue down this path,  the only  choice many  farmers and  ranchers will have will be to stop farming altogether. From  the dairies of  Vermont to the wheat fields near the  Chesapeake Bay to the cornfields  in  the Midwest, American agriculture is  under a constant barrage of irrational  and unworkable regulations from the  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  which are burdensome, overreaching,  and that negatively affect jobs in rural  economies.  This EPA is mostly interested in pursuing the extreme agenda of environmentalist groups without any consideration for the impact it will have on our  farmers and ranchers. For example, the  EPA wants to treat milk spills like oil  spills  simply because milk contains  animal  fat. The EPA has suggested  that milk storage should be regulated  under the Clean Water Act as large oil  tanks. The EPA wants farmers to till  fields without  producing  any  dust.  Clearly, the  folks at the EPA have  never stepped foot on a farm in western  Oklahoma, or otherwise  they would  know that dust happens, and all the  regulations in the world can’t eliminate  its existence. The EPA wants  farmers to ensure that none of the  spray we use for pests drifts even 1 foot  away from the original source.  The EPA has  started an unprecedented  re-reevaluation  evaluation—  yes, I said re-reevaluation—of the popular wheat control product Atrazine. In  2006, the EPA completed a 12-year review involving 6,000 studies and 80,000  public comments, yet one of the first  orders of business for the Obama administration was to start all over after  an article appeared in The New York  Times. The EPA is trying to regulate  watersheds based off of inaccurate and  flawed models—a problem recognized  even by the top officials at USDA.  The list goes on and on. But what  further illustrates the alarming frame  of mind of the EPA is that the agency  has gone so far as to recently hold a  contest for the public to create videos  explaining what Federal  regulations  are ‘‘important to everyone.’’ In many  instances, the agency is overreaching  its  authority.  Instead  of  operating  within the law, the EPA believes it can  order Congress to pass legislation that  gives it more authority and threaten to  regulate anyway  if Congress chooses  not to act.  The message from the President is  clear: Pass a cap-and-tax bill or we’ll  pursue an endangerment finding. Pass  more authority to regulate watersheds  or we’ll proceed with an Executive  order.  Sadly  for America’s  farmers  and  ranchers,  these  regulations  are not  limited to the EPA. The Department of  Agriculture’s Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyard agency’s proposed  rule on purported  ‘‘fairness’’  far exceeds congressional intent expressed in  the 2008 farm bill. It lacks a credible  economic analysis and has so far been  the result of a regulatory process that  can only be described as flawed. We  have  a  responsibility  to  producers,  packers, processors, retailers—and yes,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:39 Feb 11, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11FE7.025 H11FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

215,19,2011-02-11,Ms. BUERKLE.,"  I  thank  the gentleman from California for yielding his  time.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of  H. Res. 72.  Last November, the American people  sent a message to all levels of government: get the government out of the  way so that employers can create new  jobs.  Many in Washington seek a solution  to our country’s economic slowdown  through a revision of the Tax Code and  broad cuts in all levels of spending. I  support these initiatives, but I do not  believe they are enough. We must provide a climate for economic growth and  job creation. Congress must relieve the  American people from the hidden tax  of excessive regulation and red tape. It  is a tax that affects everyone, passed  on every day in increased costs of products and services.  To put things in perspective, according to a report issued last year by the  Small Business Administration, the approximate economic cost of regulation  is a staggering $1.75 trillion annually.  Increased  regulations  stifle  job creation and the expansion of businesses,  both large and small. It cripples their  competitiveness  in a global market  while smothering the innovative spirit  that has made the United States of  America great.  Moreover, businesses are not the only  ones who are harmed by these unnecessary  regulations.  Municipalities,  school districts, not-for-profits, health  care providers, and others serving the  public pay a high cost to comply with  the Federal bureaucracy.  Regardless of who I talk to in the  great State of New York, I ask, What  regulations burden you? Businesses of  all sizes and from all industries talk  about  how  they  incur  unnecessary  overhead for compliance.  ",2011

217,19,2011-02-11,Mr. ISSA., I yield the gentlewoman  an additional 30 seconds.  ,2011
218,19,2011-02-11,Ms. BUERKLE.," School districts tell  my office of receiving Federal grants  that will cost them two to five times  the size of the grant to administer the  grant.  Not all regulations are unwarranted.  Most Americans would agree on the  need for regulatory protection, and to  assume otherwise of this committee is  irresponsible.  Congress must address the cost to  both business and the public before a  new regulation is adopted. As Members  of Congress, we cannot cede over the  responsibility of legislation to the unchecked regulatory regimes that end  up levying this hidden tax.  ",2011
219,19,2011-02-11,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Madam Speaker, it  gives me great honor to yield 3 minutes  to the distinguished gentleman  from  Maryland, the whip, ",2011
220,19,2011-02-11,Mr. STENYHOYER.,  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ,2011
221,19,2011-02-11,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  This  resolution directs  the House  committees to review Federal regulations for their effect on our economy. I  agree with this resolution and I will  vote for this resolution. In fact, that is  an oversight, of course, that committees should  in  fact be carrying out  without this resolution.  Democrats believe that  it’s  important to vigorously review regulations  to make sure they are keeping pace  with the changing economy, and that’s  why President Obama  has  already  issued an executive order that calls for  such a review.  Where  regulations are duplicative,  where they stifle innovation and entrepreneurship, where they hold job creation back without protecting  consumers,  they  should  be  revised  or  ended.  But let’s also remember that Federal  regulations keep our drinking water  and our air clean, protect our children  from unsafe toys and food, put a check  on abusive practices of insurance companies and credit card companies, and  help control the kind of Wall Street  gambling that wrecked our economy  just a few years ago.  b1200  As a matter of fact, even though regulations were on the books, we know  they were not enforced, which led to  literally the loss of trillions of dollars  by homeowners, individuals and businesses. We want regulations that protect Americans and  foster economic  growth and will call the committees to  review regulations with both of those  goals in mind.  There is a reason that the Democrats  have worked so hard to pass the Make  It In America agenda, an agenda with  which I am particularly identified. We  need to in that agenda, if we are going  to create the environment that I heard  one of the Members on this floor talking about that will lead to businesses  being able to make things in America  and do so profitably, review regulations, review tax policies, and review  other government policies  to make  sure we are competitive in the global  marketplace. But we  also want  to  make sure that we have consumers protected, as I said, and the environment  protected, because there should not be  a trade-off, but a complementary working of the two together.  The new environment  the Federal  Government ought to work to create  will promote growth, jobs, and success  of the American people. Make It In  America  not  only means manufacturing it, but it means succeeding in  America, succeeding in global markets.  I will, as I said, vote for this resolution. But the test will not be whether  this resolution passes or fails. The test  will be whether or not in fact we do the  work that the American public expects  us to do. The test will be whether our  economy does succeed under the revisions we have made.  I tell my friends on that side of the  aisle, neither one of us have done perhaps the job we should have done.

223,26,2011-02-11,Ms. BARBARA  LEE.,  ,2011
224,26,2011-02-11,Ms. LEE.," I thank the gentleman from  South Carolina, our assistant Democratic leader, for yielding and for his  leadership.  I strongly oppose H. Res. 72. This  does nothing to create jobs. Secondly,  it does nothing to address really the  regulations and the policies that impact the poor and the long-term unemployed.  I submitted an amendment to this  resolution that required each standing  committee  to  review administrative  actions or policies that ‘‘reduce poverty and address  the needs of  the  chronically unemployed.’’ However, the  Republican majority on the Rules Committee refused to include this modest  but important provision. I am forced to  conclude  that my Republican  colleagues don’t quite understand the desperate conditions  that confront  the  poor and long-term unemployed. Within the resolution, I see a list of directing actions to committees to review  regulations  that  impede, discourage,  hurt, harm, or  limit  the ability of  agencies to achieve specific policy objectives. However, there are no directions to address the pain and the misery experienced by millions of poor  people  and  the  chronically  unemployed.  In the United States, the number of  persons  below  the  poverty  line  increased from 39.3 million in 2008 to 42.9  million in 2009. In California, the rate  increased from 4.8 million in 2008 to 5.1  million in 2009. Yet the resolution before us gives marching orders to committees  to  identify  regulations  that  impede, fail, hurt, or limit. I cannot  understand why the majority does not  want to identify regulations that fail,  hurt, or harm the poor and the chronically unemployed or limits the poor  from achieving middle income status.  This is not a partisan issue and we  must all remember that poverty affects  constituents that reside in Republican  and Democratic districts.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  BISHOPof Utah). The time of the gentlewoman has expired.  ",2011

226,26,2011-02-11,Ms. LEE of California.," I thank the  gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, the new majority promised to provide a comprehensive plan to  restore America to prosperity and to  create jobs. Unfortunately, this resolution does not do anything to deliver on  that promise.  Furthermore, I hope that this body,  both Democrats and Republicans, will  begin to focus on the fact that we have  millions of people who are poor, who  are low income, and who are chronically unemployed.  b1300  Whatever we do, we need a yardstick,  and we need a criteria, and we need  standards so that we can look at how  what we do here on this floor elevates  and lifts up people who are below the  poverty line and helps them move into  middle-income status. This resolution  does not do that. It’s really a bunch of  rhetoric, as I see it. I really can’t figure out what it’s about. It does nothing, and it certainly does nothing to  create  jobs  for those whom we care  about.  ",2011

228,26,2011-02-11,Mr. ROSKAM.," Mr. Speaker, today  the folks on the other side of the aisle  are actually arguing in the alternative.  We heard the gentleman from New Jersey say, well, Republicans at least are  finally getting to it. You don’t need  this  resolution. And  the gentlelady  from California  says,  the  resolution  isn’t good enough.  I think what is clear is one thing.  What we’ve seen from the past 2 years  has been failure. I mean, it’s ironic.  There’s nobody, Mr. Speaker, that’s on  the floor today defending the economic  policies of the past 2 years, the stimulus that promised 8 percent and obviously, the overpromising and under-delivering.  Jobs are job one of this Congress. It  is imperative that we focus. And what  we’re doing with this resolution is putting an  imprimatur of the work of  these committees, saying your priority  is to go through chapter and verse on  these  regulations and  separate  that  out. The ones that don’t add value, the  ones that aren’t making people safer,  the ones that are complete nonsense,  let’s focus in on them, highlight them,  and remove them.  We have to remove the barriers to job  creation. That  is our  responsibility.  That is what should be bringing us all  together.  I urge the swift passage of this resolution.  ",2011
229,26,2011-02-11,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  the balance of my time to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CARNAHAN).  ",2011
230,26,2011-02-11,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Mr. Speaker, we  just spent the past 2 days telling committees to do their jobs. Why aren’t we  focusing on creating jobs, creating jobs  for the American people?  Let me be clear: I’m in favor of a  strong and vigorous debate here on cutting redtape and finding bipartisan solutions to our Nation’s problems. But  to pretend that commonsense oversight  measures to protect families and businesses are inherently burdensome with  no benefit fails to acknowledge the reality of the financial disaster that was  brought upon  this country on Wall  Street. It fails to acknowledge the disaster of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of  Mexico. It fails to acknowledge toxic  toys and drywall  coming  into  this  country. It fails to acknowledge the increase  in deadly  food-borne  illnesses  from lax oversight of our food safety  system. And  it  fails to acknowledge  what the American people want us to  work on right now, and that’s creating  good jobs to support their families.  I believe that we all want what is  best for the people we represent, although we often have different ideas  about how to get there. But to structure a debate that is so one-sided, that  attempts to gloss over the very events  that created this recession, is not serving the American people. Let’s look at  the entire picture.  I will be offering a motion to recommit that will ensure we place a high  priority on protecting the safety of  America’s  food supply, safe drinking  water, and the safety of children’s toys  in this country. This is, and should be,  an essential function of our Nation’s  government.  Just last year, cadmium, a known  carcinogen, was found in amounts in  excess of 90 percent in children’s bracelets imported from China. This stuff  happens  far  too often, and without  strong oversight and commonsense regulation, American children would continue to be put at risk.  I don’t believe any of my colleagues  here  are  against  protecting  public  health and ensuring that we are doing  our duty as elected officials to protect  our constituents. That’s why I’d like to  reach out  to my colleagues on  the  other side of the aisle and ask them to  join us, join us in this motion to recommit which will instruct House committees to make the health and safety  of our  families a priority also. Preserving commonsense safety standards  is just as important as reforming overly burdensome regulations.  Let’s work together to help create  the environment that protects our citizens. Let’s move quickly to the jobs  agenda that Americans want and deserve. Americans are still waiting for  this House to take up the jobs agenda.  ",2011

232,26,2011-02-11,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, my  point to the Democratic Party and the  leadership of that party  is, wait no  longer. The Republican Party is now in  charge in this House, and our agenda is  about jobs. It is about reducing spending, and it is about reducing the size of  government.  And today, after 91⁄2hours of debate,  we start with rules and regulations  that not only  stifle  innovativeness,  that stifle inventions, and jobs, and job  creation, but it is harming the way of  life of the free enterprise system and  sapping the energy from that system.  By reviewing existing, pending, and  proposed regulations from agencies of  the Federal Government, Congress can  begin to assist small and large businesses to focus on job creation, economic growth, and innovation. We first  need to understand the too true impact  that is being placed upon the free enterprise system.  We know with the current rules that  are in place, $1.75 trillion dollars is the  cost annually to the U.S. economic free  enterprise system. It’s time for Congress to reevaluate these rules and regulations.  Regulatory burdens are hindering job  growth.

235,47,2011-02-11,Ms. SCHWARTZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor and congratulate Ms. Barbara Allen  on the occasion of being named as a winner  of the Purpose Prize. Ms. Allen was selected  from over 1,000 applicants for her work raising  funds for public school art programs.  The Purpose Prize  is an award given by  Civic Ventures, a  think-tank  that  focuses on  work and social purpose. For  the past  five  years the purpose prize has been given to 10  people, all age 60 and over, who have developed new ways to solve social problems. As  individuals who have completed their mid-life  careers, the winners of the purpose prize have  all shown that social innovation is not the sole  province of the young. Civic Ventures considered  the Purpose Prize  to be not a  lifetime  achievement award, but an investment in the  future of the winner.  Ms. Allen has won this award through her  laudable efforts to maintain the arts in public  schools. She is the founder and CEO of Fresh  Artists, a nonprofit that has raised more than  $100,000 benefiting 272 Philadelphia public  schools to the enrichment of over 53,000 children. Fresh Artists utilizes the creativity of our  students to achieve the goal of funding the art  programs that can help more students harness  their own creativity. The organization  invites  students  in grades K  through 12  to donate  their artwork to be used in large-scale reproductions. Fresh Artists then collects monetary  donations from businesses and organizations  who display the artwork in their buildings. The  donations are then used to buy art supplies for  Philadelphia’s most  under-resourced  public  schools. Since its founding in 2008, Fresh Artists has  installed nearly 600  reproductions.  Barbara Allen’s vision and dedication  to  the  arts have provided students with an opportunity to not only have their work displayed,  but also to have their work contribute to the  purchase of supplies that allow other students  to produce further works of art.  I ask  that my colleagues  join me  in congratulating Ms. Allen on this momentous occasion. Her dedication to the art will ensure that  the students of Philadelphia’s public schools  continue to have access to the supplies that  will allow them to fully realize their creative potential.  f  TRIBUTE TO MR. CHARLIE  BURRELL  HON. DIANA DeGETTE  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 11, 2011  ",2011
236,47,2011-02-11,Ms. DEGETTE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor  the extraordinary  life and exceptional  accomplishments of Mr. Charlie Burrell, known  internationally as  ‘‘the  Jackie Robinson of  classical music’’ and the ‘‘titan of the classical  and jazz bass,’’ on the occasion of the celebration of his 90th birthday.  Charlie was born in Toledo, Ohio, in 1922,  and raised in Detroit, Michigan. An acclaimed  contrabass player, he was one of the first African-American musicians  to break  the color  barrier of a major U.S. symphony. Honored by  the  Alphonse  Robinson  African-American  Music Association for his invaluable contributions, he has received accolades from his colleagues for having opened the door for other  African-American musicians by demonstrating  that  they did not have  to be  relegated  to  stereotypical musical styles.  Charlie began the pursuit of a musical career at an early age at the encouragement of  his mother. A chance hearing of a performance of the San Francisco Symphony led to  his desire  to become  the  first African-American musician to perform with the company—  a dream he would realize twenty-eight years  later.  Although a dedicated student of classical  music, Charlie and his friends embraced jazz  music and practiced it whenever possible. At  seventeen, Charlie was even asked to join the  Lionel Hampton Big Band, affording him the  opportunity to travel the country with some of  the jazz greats of the time. Upon graduation  from Cass Technical High School in Detroit,  then  one  of  the most  prestigious music  schools in the nation, Charlie saw his classmates move directly  into professional symphonies, while he was unable to because of  the color of his skin. But that never deterred  his resolve to play.  In 1941, he attended the New England Conservatory of Music and then joined the Navy  where he was stationed at  the Great Lakes  Naval Base outside Chicago. There, he was  selected  to  join  the  first-ever all-Black Navy  band, a recruiting device the Navy developed  to  encourage  African-American  enlistment.  Following his honorable discharge  from  the  Navy, he attended Wayne State University  with an eye  towards  teaching music  in  the  public schools. At the time of his graduation,  he once again faced the challenge of discrimination when was told by the administrator of  music  for  the Detroit School System  there  would be no African-American music teachers  in their schools.  But Charlie continued to pursue his dreams.  After he was turned down for auditions with  four different companies, he moved to Denver,  Colorado, where he worked at Fitzsimons  Army Hospital and enrolled in the University of  Denver  to earn his  teaching certificate. He  later taught for the Denver Public Schools. A  chance meeting with John VanBuskirk,  the  lead bass player with the Denver Symphony,  led to an audition with the company. Charlie  broke through the color barrier of the time to  become the first African-American musician to  join the Denver Symphony Orchestra.  And in 1959, realizing his childhood dream,  Charlie Burrell went on to become the first African-American musician  to ever play  in  the  San Francisco Symphony. During his five-and-  a-half year stay in San Francisco, he also became  the  first African-American  to play with  the San Francisco Opera and the San Francisco Ballet orchestras, and the first African-  American professor at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.  Upon arriving back in Denver, he was hired  again by  the Denver Symphony Orchestra  where he performed for more than thirty years.  Whenever  top  jazz musicians performed  in  Denver, Charlie was often called on  to play  with them.  During his  lifetime Charlie has mentored  and performed with many musicians. He has  played with nearly all of the great names in  the  jazz world:  jazz bass great Milt Hinton;  jazz stride pianist Fats Waller; Lionel Hampton; jazz trumpeter Clark Terry; bassist Major  Holley; and jazz trombonist Al Grey. One of  his  favorite  vocalists was  the  late  Billie  Holliday. He is especially proud of his cousin,  the renowned pianist George Duke, and his  two-time Grammy award-winning niece,  jazz  vocalist Dianne Reeves, both of whom he  taught and mentored.  On a personal note, Charlie played bass in  a jazz trio founded by my uncle Al Rose. The  Al Rose Trio became  the  first  racially  integrated  jazz group  in Denver, and when my  uncle passed, Charlie asked me if he could be  my Honorary Uncle—which he is to this day.  Retired from the Denver Symphony Orchestra since 1999, Charlie continues to be an active member of  the community, on occasion  playing  his  bass with  his Cousin Purnell  Steen’s swing quartet. A comment he made  during a PBS  ‘‘Special Jazz  in Five Points’’  broadcast best sums up his life, ‘‘Music is my  great love affair, and, in fact, it is my first, and  always has been, my first.’’  Charlie has been and continues to be an inspiration  to musicians  young  and  old  all  across our country, but we in Denver are incredibly blessed and proud to call him one of  our own. I join all my constituents in wishing  Charlie a very happy birthday and congratulating him for his lifetime of achievement.

238,5,2011-02-17,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield the gentlewoman an additional  minute.  ",2011
239,5,2011-02-17,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," None of  the privacy concerns or civil liberty infringement issues that were raised in  those hearings have  even been addressed. I’m deeply concerned that my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle  are considering overlooking the very  valid concerns of the American people  without so much as a hearing. Therefore, I would argue that this is an improvement in terms of how fast we’ll  have to move, but it still has the same  faults. And  I  simply  say  that  the  Fourth Amendment does say that it is  the right of people to be secure in their  persons, houses, papers, and  effects  against unreasonable search and seizures.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to  vote against this and begin our work as  quickly as we can. But even with this  provision passing, as I expect it will,  we need to move quickly to protect the  American people, both  in  terms of  homeland security and their constitutional right of privacy.  I rise today to express my opposition to the  H.R. 514,  ‘‘To extend expiring provisions of  the USA PATRIOT  Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 relating to access to business records, and individual terrorists as agents.’’  This bill would extend provisions of the USA  PATRIOT  Improvement and Reauthorization  Act of 2005, and the Intelligence Reform and  Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 through December 8, 2011. It extends a provision that allows a roving electronic surveillance authority,  and a provision revising  the definition of an  ‘‘agent of a foreign power’’ to include any non-  U.S. person who engages in international terrorism or preparatory activities, also known as  the ‘‘lone wolf provision.’’ It also grants government access to business records relating to  a terrorist investigation.  While the PATRIOT Act is intended to improve our ability to protect our nation, it needs  to be  revised and amended  to  reflect  the  democratic principles  that make  this country  the crown jewel of democracy. The bill before  us today, however, does not do that. In fact,  even the manner by which are even considering this bill, only days after introduction without any oversight hearings of mark-ups, circumvents  the process we have  in place  to  allow  for  improvements and amendments  to  be made.  The  three expiring provisions of  the PATRIOT Act  that H.R.  514 would  extend  overstep the bounds of the government investigative power set forth in the Constitution.  The  first provision authorizes  the government to obtain ‘‘any tangible thing’’ relevant to  a terrorism investigation, even if there is no  showing that the ‘‘thing’’ pertains to suspected  terrorists or terrorist activities. This provision,  which was addressed  in  the Judiciary Committee during the 111th Congress, runs a foul  of  the  traditional notions of search and seizure, which require the government to show  ‘‘reasonable suspicion’’ or  ‘‘probable cause’’  before undertaking an  investigation  that  infringes upon a person’s privacy. Congress  must ensure  that  things collected with  this  power have a meaningful nexus to suspected  terrorist activity. If we do not take steps to improve this provision, then it should be allowed  to expire.  The second provision, known commonly as  the ‘‘roving John Doe wiretap,’’ allows the government to obtain intelligence surveillance orders that identify neither the person nor the facility to be tapped. Like the first provision, this,  too, was addressed  in  the Judiciary Committee during the last Congress, and is also  contrary  to  traditional notions of search and  seizure, which  require government  to state  ‘‘with particularity’’ what it seeks to search or  seize. If this provision were given the opportunity to be amended and improved, it should  be done so to mirror similar and longstanding  criminal laws that permit roving wiretaps, but  require the naming of a specific target.  The third provision that H.R. 514 would extend is the ‘‘lone wolf’’ provision, which permits secret intelligence surveillance of non-US  persons who are not affiliated with a foreign  organization. This type of authorization, which  is only granted in secret courts, is subject to  abuse, and  threatens our  longtime understandings of the limits of the government’s investigatory powers within  the borders of  the  United States. Moreover, according to government testimony, this provision has never been  used. Because of the potential for abuse created by this provision, and the lack of need for  its existence, it, too, should be allowed to expire.  Another problem with H.R. 514 is that it fails  to amend other portions of the Patriot Act in  dire need of reform, specifically, those issues  relating  to  the  issuance and use of national  security letters (NSLs). NSLs permit the government to obtain the communication, financial  and credit records of anyone deemed relevant  to a terrorism investigation, even if that person  is not suspected of unlawful behavior. I repeat,  even if that person is NOT suspected of unlawful behavior.  The three provisions I have just mentions,  as well as the issues surrounding NSLs, have  all been examined and amended in the past  Congresses, because they were in dire need  of improvements to protect the rights of Americans. I was against these provisions, as written, in the past, and without amendments, I  am still against them today.  Issues surrounding  these particular provisions are not a stranger to us, for we have  been dealing with them since 2001 when the  PATRIOT Act was  introduced.  In 2005,  the  Patriot was examined  in  the Judiciary Committee. I, along with other Members of the Judiciary Committee like Mr. CONYERSand Mr.  NADLER, offered multiple amendments that not  only addressed  the  three provisions  in H.R.  514, but also National Security Letters and the  lax standards of intent.  Again, these same issues came before us in  2007. On August 3, 2007, I stood before you  on the House floor discussing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  (FISA), another  piece of law used in conjunction with the PATRIOT Act and essential to combating the war  on terror, but one that was in need of improvements  to protect Americans’ Constitutionally  enshrined civil  liberties. On  that day,  I said  that,  ‘‘we must ensure  that our  intelligence  professionals have the tools that they need to  protect our Nation, while also safeguarding the  rights of law-abiding Americans,’’ and I stand  firmly behind that notion today.  When we were  considering FISA,  there  were Fourth Amendment concerns around secret surveillance and secret searches, which  were kept permanently secret from the Americans whose homes and conversations were  targeted. There were also concerns such secret searches intended for non-U.S. citizens,  could be used to target Americans.  I offered amendments  to ensure  that any  surveillance of an American is done through  established legal procedures pursuant to FISA  and the FISA court authority, and to ensure  that  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court  is  indispensable  and would  play  a  meaningful role  in ensuring compliance with  our constitution. I stand here today urging my  colleagues to consider allowing similar amendments to the PATRIOT Act that better protect  Americans’ right to privacy before moving this  legislation out of the House of Representatives  and onto the other legislative body.

(2) V–22 Osprey aircraft.  ",2011

250,19,2011-02-17,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Chairman, this  amendment would eliminate the V–22  Osprey aircraft and the expeditionary  fighting vehicle. For years, the Pentagon has been throwing billions at  weapons systems that don’t work and  don’t keep us safe; weapons systems  that are obsolete in the post-Cold War  era; weapons systems that are not giving us bang for the buck.  The V–22 Osprey  is  essentially  a  lemon. It makes defense contractors  rich but doesn’t make our military  strong. It has a notoriously bad safety  record, having killed 30 of our own people in training exercises, and a deadly  V–22 crash in Afghanistan last year was  claimed as a victory by the Taliban.  Billions over budget for a weapons system that’s killing our own people—not  a good deal for the taxpayer, to say the  least.  The GAO has noted that this plane  has trouble flying over 8,000 feet or in  extreme heat. It also has problems carrying troops, transporting cargo, and  operating in high-threat environments.  A combat plane that can’t operate in  high-threat  environments?  Is  there  anything the Osprey can do? Actually,  can  it deliver mail? The President’s  deficit  commission  recently  recommended  we  stop  writing  blank  checks for the Osprey. So did another  top official who more than 20 years ago  said: ‘‘Given the risk we face from a  military standpoint, the V–22 is at the  bottom of the list, and for that reason,  I decided to terminate it.’’  That’s not a prominent Democrat  speaking, Mr.  Chairman;  that’s  a  former Secretary of Defense named  Dick Cheney.  The Marine  Corps’  expeditionary  fighting vehicle would provide almost  as much savings, between $8 and $9 billion over the next decade. The President’s proposed budget pulls the plug  on this system, which is more than 14  years behind schedule and has also experienced major cost overruns.  According to the Task Force on a  Unified  Security Budget,  the EFV  breaks down on average every 8 hours  and has  trouble  steering  in water.  Shouldn’t we be worried about an amphibious vehicle that doesn’t steer well  in water? Would you spend billions of  dollars on a  family car that breaks  down every 8 hours and doesn’t steer  well?  And besides, even if the EFV ran like  a dream, when was the last time we  needed to  launch an attack by sea?  Once again, we’re developing weapons  for enemies that no longer exist.  With spending cut fever having hit  Capitol Hill, you would think these  wasteful systems would be among the  very first on the chopping block. But  naturally my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle would rather scale  back the very things keeping people  safe and strong—police on the streets,  investments in innovation and infrastructure, NIH research, education assistance  from Head  Start  to Pell  Grants, and much, much more.  I say we go in a different direction. If  we’re serious about restoring fiscal discipline, both the V–22 Osprey and the  EFV must go.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011
251,19,2011-02-17,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Mr. Chairman, I withdraw the reservation on the  point of order.  ",2011

253,19,2011-02-17,Mr. DICKS., I move to strike the requisite number of words.  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  from  Washington  is recognized  for 5 minutes.  ,2011
254,19,2011-02-17,Mr. DICKS.," We have already had a  straight up-or-down vote on the Osprey  and resoundingly supported it here in  the committee.  On the expeditionary fighting vehicle, there’s a decision been made by the  Secretary of the Navy to end this program. What we’re trying to do is to do  it in a way that finishes the research  with an additional  $34 million and  avoids termination liability.  I urge a ‘‘no’’ on this amendment.  I yield to the gentleman from Florida, the chairman.  ",2011
255,19,2011-02-17,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment. We just had a very  good colloquy on the issue of the EFV  and we think we have a solution here  that is good for the taxpayer, is good  for the Marine Corps, and is good for  the Marines. Here’s an opportunity to  get something for the $3 billion that  we’ve already spent on this program.  So I must be opposed to that.  On the V–22, we’ve already voted on  that once during the earlier procedures  on this bill. The V–22 did have some developmental problems years ago. The  V–22 is a most effective weapon being  used  in Afghanistan. Because of the  high mountains, because of the high altitudes, because of the weather, the V–  22 is the vehicle of choice to move our  war fighters from where they are to  where they have to be.  I would hope that the vote would be  the same on this amendment as it was  earlier on the V–22, and that’s to defeat  it. Here is an airplane—the Marines use  this V–22 in Afghanistan on a regular  basis because it has the capability that  the CH–46 does not have. It has the  ability for altitude, it has the ability  for speed, and it is an outstanding aircraft today.  ",2011
256,19,2011-02-17,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Chair, although  I  support Secretary Gates’ call to terminate the  Expeditionary Force Vehicle (EFV), I must unfortunately oppose  the Woolsey amendment  because  it also seeks  to cancel  the Osprey  program, whose termination I do not support.  The EFV is clearly not a wise use of American tax dollars. It is 14 years behind schedule  and estimated to cost 168 percent more than  originally estimated. Because of  these realities, along with the evolving nature of naval  warfare, Secretary Gates, the Secretary of the  Navy and  the Commandant of  the Marine  Corps have all recommended that it be terminated—and  it was not  included  in President  Obama’s FY 12 Budget. By contrast, after  overcoming a number of operational and cost  concerns, the Osprey has become a top priority  for  the Marine Corps and does enjoy  command support.  If I could split this amendment into two separate votes, I would do so. Since I cannot, I  will oppose it and continue to pursue a deliberate, program by program approach to finding  needed savings in our defense budget.  ",2011

264,26,2011-02-17,Mr. STEARNS.," I would just close by  saying  it  is not appropriate  for the  unelected FCC to regulate interstate  communication  services  on  barely  more than a whim and without any additional input from the United States  Congress.  If  left unchallenged,  this  claim of authority would allow  the  FCC to do anything, anything it could  allege  to  promote  broadband under  their  jurisdiction, which  they don’t  have.  So Congress must stop the FCC. This  amendment will do that just by preventing any money from being spent to  implement these rules. I urge its adoption.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

267,26,2011-02-17,Mr. WAXMAN.,"  I  thank you very  much for recognizing me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the proposal.  This amendment  is bad policy.  It  would overturn a decision by the FCC  enacted last December that would protect the Internet from those who might  interfere with the ability of consumers  to access whatever they want.  Mr. UPTONsimply said a minute ago  a lot of jobs are created by the Internet. Well, that is why we shouldn’t stop  the FCC. The most vibrant sector of  our economy  today  is our  Internet  economy. U.S. companies like Google,  Facebook, Amazon and E-Bay are leading the world in innovation; and they  all urge the FCC to protect and open  the  Internet  because  commonsense  baseline rules are critical to ensuring  that the Internet remains a key engine  of economic growth,  innovation and  global competitiveness. In fact, these  high-tech and high-growth companies  urged the FCC to adopt even stronger  rules than it did.  Contrary  to  the  hyperventilated  rhetoric from the majority, the FCC  rules do not  regulate  the  Internet.  They do not grant the government the  power to turn off the Internet. They do  not determine what content is appropriate for users to access. Their goal is  just the opposite. They prevent Internet gatekeepers, like Verizon, from deciding what content their subscribers  can access.  But the FCC rules were a very light  touch regulation, and it is notable that  AT&T, Comcast  and Time Warner,  three of the Nation’s largest network  operators,  support  these  rules. As  AT&T’s CEO stated, ‘‘We didn’t get everything we wanted. I wanted no regulation. But we ended at a place where  we have a line of sight and we know we  can commit to investments.’’  Major Wall Street investment analysts have concluded that the FCC’s  open Internet order removed any regulatory overhang for telecom and cable  companies and reflected a light touch  version of  regulation  that will not  hinder innovation or growth.  Now, what is at stake here is those  who are offering this amendment to  stop the FCC from doing what it has  ordered want the people who carry the  Internet able to restrict the access for  consumers and creators who have used  the  Internet  for such great success.  That would be a serious mistake.  We had a broad, diverse coalition of  more than 120 organizations, including  public interest groups, religious leaders,  technology  associations,  labor  unions, Internet companies and small  businesses who wrote to us strongly opposing the Republican efforts to block  the open  Internet  regulations. They  argue that overturning the regulations  would eliminate the FCC’s ability to  protect  innovation, speech and commerce on broadband platforms.  If we stop the FCC from regulating,  well, then we  leave the status quo,  which means that those who deliver  the Internet into our home can start  regulating  it themselves. The American people, I think, would be against  this. They want us to stop this re-litigation of FCC’s sensible open Internet  rules. We should be working together  on a bipartisan  solution  to  expand  broadband access and create  tomorrow’s economic opportunities.  The FCC took  landmark action to  preserve the open Internet. Let us not  roll back the clock and stop those regulations by the FCC to preserve the  open  Internet  from  being  put  into  place.  I urge opposition to this effort. And I  want to say that this does not save any  money. This  proposal will not  cut  costs. This is only about policy, and  the high-tech high-growth companies  have urged the FCC to adopt these  rules. We shouldn’t use the appropriations process to make this effort to  stop the FCC from doing its job.  I yield back my time.  b1240  ",2011

270,26,2011-02-17,Mr. GRAVES of Georgia.," Mr. Chairman, I’m here today in support of this  amendment, and I want to thank those  who have been working in this effort—  Mrs.  EMERSON, Mr. WALDEN, Mr.  UPTON, and Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I appreciate them letting me join in this debate.  As we’ve heard a lot of the conversation,  it gets complicated sometimes  when you have elected officials get up  and start talking about broadband and  Internet and FCC. Well, let’s make it  simple. Government control means uniformity, regulations, fees, inspections,  and yes,  compliance. Just  think  if  those words had existed since the 1990s  with the Internet. We wouldn’t know  one thing about ‘‘broadband,’’ let alone  a ‘‘tweet.’’ The Internet’s marketplace  is defined by fierce competition, and  that competition has transformed this  world with innovation, investment, and  what we need most of all right now—  jobs. It’s possible that the most intelligent and bipartisan policy that Washington has had thus far has been to  leave the Internet virtually untouched  by the Federal Government and regulators. And the result? Internet-based  industries  have  flourished  and  employed a generation of Americans. So  let’s be clear today: there is no net  neutrality crisis.  The speed and depth of the Internet  as we know it today came from consumer choice and competition. Consumers have successfully picked those  winners and  losers, not government,  and they’ve done it without the FCC’s  help.  Imagine  that.  Consider  the  choices  in  rate  plans,  the  various  points of access, and demand for openness and accessibility. A service provider that restricts access would do so  at their own peril and to the prosperity  of their competitors.  So after all the life-changing innovation, the accidental billionaires, President Obama’s  revolutionary  e-campaign, after all  the groundbreaking  technology that has defined this age of  the Internet, we must ask that question, Why? Why would unelected bureaucrats at the FCC want to take over  and feel good about this Internet takeover right now with their new rules and  policies, keeping things neutral being  their claim. Well, three words come to  mind to me today, and that is: Trojan  Horse virus.  So, Mr. Chairman,  let’s pass  this  amendment  today  and  let’s  install  some antivirus protection for Americans on the Internet.  I yield back the balance of my time.

Everybody  has  their  talking  points  and  their  little  notes  and  they’re reading them and they’re trying to confuse the issue. Let’s take a  step back, if we might, Mr. Chairman.  Let’s just ask a very simple question, a  very simple question. Can somebody  name an area in this country or in this  world that has had more innovation,  that has blossomed more,  that has  opened up communications and connected people more in our country or  anywhere in the world in the last decade than the Internet? Can anybody  name it? Anything. No. It’s impossible.  Think about what’s happened.

274,33,2011-02-17,Mr. KINZINGER  of  Illinois.," Mr.  Chairman, my friend from Michigan, I  appreciate his interest in this issue. I  have to strongly stand up and oppose  it, though.  The 11th in Illinois, which is my district, is very, very focused and very reliant upon the ability to move commerce, the ability to have transportation, the ability for free flow of goods  back and forth. That’s a major, major  industry in my district. A lot of jobs  rely on that.  One of the great assets we have is the  ability to float goods. That’s a great  thing. The fact of the matter is, when  we talk about closing the locks and  dams, we talk about the entire Chicago  region’s water and sewer infrastructure  system is built on the idea that water  flows out of Lake Michigan via the  lock  system; and  cutting  those off  would completely devastate the area.  Possibly closing  the  locks permanently is totally not a solution to the  problem. As most people have seen, the  locks themselves are not even completely sealed. Even when closed,  it  still allows for some leakage.  At a time when we are addressing a  continuing resolution, we should give  the Army Corps of Engineers time to  finish their study. Let’s continue to be  cautious. We’re talking about $30 billion in commerce that’s going to be affected in my area because we want to  quickly make a judgment on this. I understand the passion. I understand the  concern, but let’s be very cautious.  At a time when the Chicago area,  when my district has an  economic  downturn and people are waking up  every day wondering if they’re going to  be able  to  feed  their  family or  if  they’re going to have a job the next  day, or people are driving on the interstates wondering if they can even get  to work on time because there’s already enough trucks, and now we want  to add more and more trucks  if we  close these. That is the absolute wrong  answer to this.  And so I’m asking, let’s defeat this in  this continuing resolution. Let’s give  the Army Corps of Engineers the time  they need.  I ask my fellow colleagues to stand  up and oppose this. It’s too quick. We  have to be cautious. We have to wait.  We have to see.  When we took the majority, one of  the things we talked about is being  cautious when we get involved in free  market  and  commerce;  and  we’ve  talked about that caution and what we  want to do to create jobs and what we  want to do to allow people to get back  to work and to solve this deficit not  just by cutting spending, but by cutting the unemployment rate.  Well, I’m telling you, this would be  terribly devastating for the people in  Illinois, for the people in the 11th district and, frankly, for folks in the region.  b1340  ",2011

277,33,2011-02-17,Mr. CAMP.," I very much appreciate  the gentleman yielding.  And I just want to comment, the gentlewoman  from  Illinois mentioned  about her 12-year involvement in this  issue. In fact, she and I worked very  hard in 2006 to get the first funding for  the electronic barrier, but that was 5  years ago. To wait for the study that I  hear my colleagues call for is another 5  years. How much time is it going to  take before we eliminate the threat to  the entire Great Lakes ecosystem?  Again,  I appreciate the gentleman  yielding.  ",2011
278,33,2011-02-17,Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois.," No problem.  I understand, this takes time. When  we talk about affecting $30 billion in  economic commerce,  I would expect  that to take some time.  Now, again, I appreciate the concern.  I appreciate everything we’re dealing  with. This is a very serious issue. But,  my goodness, the people in my district  are already waking up wondering  if  they are going to have a job tomorrow,  begging the free market to work. And  that’s all we’re asking.  If we want to take this up at a later  time, fine. But is it really appropriate,  when  we’re  debating  hundreds  of  amendments to a continuing resolution, for this to be the area where we  do  something  that’s,  frankly,  been  working or has been  in study  for 5  years and has a lot more to go?

That  you do have to prevail in order to get  something in order to get reimbursed.  And it’s only on where you prevail that  you get any fee reimbursement.  ,2011
285,40,2011-02-17,Mr. SIMPSON.," That’s accurate. But  you don’t have to prevail in the overall  case. You could actually lose the case  for what you are trying to do. It is the  problem  that  good  intentions  have  gone awry. And I will tell you that  there are groups all across this country  who have seen this as a way to fund  their organizations, and we need to put  a halt to it. Because what we’re doing  is asking the people of this country to  fund people to sue them. I don’t know  who else does that. But on the other  hand, I agree with the gentleman that  we want those people that don’t have  the ability or the resources to have a  say in how public lands are managed,  to have a say in that. But it has gone  awry, and we need to put an end to it,  and we need to reform the process.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

288,40,2011-02-17,Mr. MARKEY.," This amendment  is  overbroad, to use a euphemistic term,  in order to describe what its impact  will be upon those who are the least  powerful, and most agreed in terms of  the impact in which the Federal Government has upon their lives as individual citizens.  Let me give you an idea of how broad  the impact of this amendment is. If  this amendment had been  in place,  would the citizens who had been unwittingly turned into nuclear guinea pigs  in the 1940s and 1950s during Federal  Government-sponsored  radiation  experiments using thousands of American  citizens without their permission have  been able to bring their lawsuits decades  later  in order to reclaim some  small compensation for their families?  Would they have been able to bring  their suits against the Federal Government? Who do you want to empower,  the people who were the guinea pigs or  the Federal Government?  Would a widow who sued the Social  Security Administration  for refusing  to provide the survivor’s benefits that  she was still due, would she be able to  sue? Or are the legal fees just so great  that the widow just has to live without  the benefits? Would  those who  live  downwind from a nuclear test and suffered cancer or other health effects,  would they be able to sue? They’ve  only found out years later what the impact is on them. How can they possibly  afford the legal fees to take on the Federal Government?  Would the atomic veteran deployed  at the test site during the atmospheric  nuclear testing of the 1950s ever have  been able to afford to bring their case  to court? Would those people all across  Nevada, Arizona, Utah, those States  out West where these poor victims only  found out later, how could they have  ever afforded to have brought a lawsuit  if they are not going to know that  their legal fees would be covered when  they win?  Would government whistleblowers be  able to bring a case in response to retaliation by their supervisors? How can  they sue the government? It’s this lone  individual against the Federal Government. We should be empowering these  individuals against the Federal Government when it acts in an imperious,  arbitrary, capricious way that ruins  people’s lives. Would citizens harmed  by a contamination at a Superfund site  at a military base in their neighborhood be able to sue the Federal Government because of the harm that has now  gone  into  their  neighborhoods? Or  should we just say, Sorry, you are out  of luck. The Federal Government did it  to you. They did it to you in your  neighborhood. You don’t have the capacity because you are just some poor  citizen living accidentally near a military base.  What would the black farmers who  were discriminated against for decades  by the Agriculture Department have  been able to do in terms of bringing a  lawsuit? They couldn’t have done it.  Those poor black farmers took a generation. Who funds that? How do they  take on the Federal Government which  had a policy of discrimination for 200  years against black farmers? How do  they do it? You are defunding all of  those lawsuits with this one amendment. What would have been the impact on Native Americans who trusted  the government to protect their interests and natural resources and instead  were ripped off? How do those Native  Americans bring their case?  All of these things are now basically  undermined by the amendment that we  are now considering. That is this impact that is being visited upon all of  these victims and all future victims,  all actions by the Federal Government  of the United States of America. This  is where you get to show what your attitude is towards the Federal Government when they are acting in a way  which does direct harm to the health,  the well-being, and the safety of ordinary Americans in our country.  I will read the amendment. ‘‘None of  the funds made available by this Act  may be used for the payment of fees  and other expenses under section 504 of  title 5’’ of the U.S. Code. So this covers  every suit that could be brought by any  citizen against any Federal agency of  the United States Government. I don’t  know how you can side with the Federal Government against ordinary citizens and their right to sue, especially  those who have been harmed the most  seriously.  So I urge a very strong ‘‘no’’ by every  Member of Congress who really does  believe that the Federal Government  has to be put in its place when they  harm ordinary citizens.  ",2011
289,40,2011-02-17,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  I move to strike the last word.  Mr.  Chairman, Members  of  the  House,  I  think Mr. MARKEY has  it  about right. You have to kind of decide  where you’re going to stand. Lawsuits  are brought every day that infuriate us  in one way or another, depending upon  where you stand and what you think  about that  issue or what you know  about that issue. But the idea that we  would take this right away from the  American people to go up against the  government  when  the  government  every day makes a series of decisions—  not all of them are perfect. Many of  them are wrong-headed. Many of them  had  repercussions  that  they hadn’t  thought through when they made the  decision. Those are the challenges that  go on every day, whether it’s in OSHA  or  the EPA or  the Department of  Labor, the Department of Interior. And  many  decisions  that  are made upstream have a  lot of  ramifications  downstream.  Let’s not pretend that every Forest  Service sale is perfectly configured and  thought about the externalities, the  impacts on grazers,  the  impacts on  farmers downstream, the  impacts on  the  streams,  the  sedimentation,  the  impact on the fisheries.

It is the cement capital of Texas.  Mr. Chairman, Republicans are not  for no regulation of mercury. We think  this particular mercury rule is flawed.  My good friend, the former chairman  Mr. WAXMAN of  California,  talked  about the rigorous analysis that was  done. His definition of ‘‘rigorous’’ and  my definition of ‘‘rigorous’’ are not one  and the same. We think that analysis  was fairly flawed.  I would point out that most pollutants—and we do agree that mercury is  a  pollutant—are measured  in  tons.  Mercury emissions from these plants  are measured in pounds per year, so  mercury is a trace element of these  pollutants. We think that we should go  back and actually do a real economic  analysis and also a health analysis.  My good friend from Massachusetts  was  talking  about  the  dangers  of  health. Those are real dangers. But  again, given that the trace amounts of  mercury that are emitted per year are  in pounds, it is a very tenuous connection to say that the mercury from a cement plant has a direct correlation  with some of the potential side effects  that  the gentleman  from Massachusetts was talking about.

311,54,2011-02-17,Mrs. EMERSON.," Since 2001, in the  wake of the Enron scandal, this committee has more  than  doubled  the  SEC’s budget. In fact, the SEC’s budget  has increased 163 percent since 2001. I  would  like to remind my colleagues  that in 2001 the SEC was funded specifically at $423 million; and  last year,  with the fiscal year 2010 act, this committee provided the SEC with an appropriation of $1.1 billion.  Yet even with all of the money that  we have given them and the opportunity they have had to begin upgrading their computers so, yes, they could  deal with flash crashes and the like and  hire more people and tougher enforcers, in spite of that they missed two  major Ponzi schemes. They have had  difficulty every single year since 2004  submitting clean budget statements for  audit. They have had consistent trouble  in their  leasing practices, which  has led to millions of taxpayer dollars  wasted. And just even more specific to  the Ponzi schemes, regarding them, the  SEC has had multiple complaints filed  against both entities over a decade before  either  individual  was  even  charged.  b1640  So how is it also that the agency  that’s  in charge, as my good  friend  said, and needs to be in charge of regulating our financial market, can’t even  produce an accurate  financial statement of their own since 2004, in spite of  the fact that since 2001 we’ve increased  their budget.  In addition, the SEC’s own inspector  general has cited the agency for poor  leasing practices, which has led to millions of taxpayer dollars being wasted  on unused leased space. I’m sure my  colleagues have read in the newspapers  about the hundreds of thousands of  square feet of leased space that they  leased in anticipation of the work they  might do on Dodd-Frank, but  they  leased it before the bill was even passed  and money appropriated.  So when my colleagues argue that  the SEC doesn’t have enough funding,  I’ve got to argue perhaps they do but  they’re not using the funding in the appropriate ways. All of us have had to  tighten our belts. And I understand the  need for us to have strong regulation. I  am not opposed to strong regulation of  the  financial  industry—of banks and  nonbanks and hedge funds and the like.  But at a time when we’re all trying to  do more with less, I think that it’s important for all of the agencies of the  government to do more with less, too.  And so even with the cuts in this bill,  the SEC is still going to be funded at  over a billion dollars.  I believe very, very strongly that we  must make  this agency understand  that they’ve got to try to revamp the  systems they’ve got within and to use  the moneys that we’ve given them, in  addition to all the  fees they’ve collected, more appropriately. And they  need to try to do that. If they can’t,  then we can discuss this again. But we  need to continue saving money.  Plus, my colleague has taken too  much money from the GSA in addition  to  the  $1.7 billion we’ve  taken. So  you’re cutting them or you’re cutting  the IRS by over $600 million. We are  cutting the IRS. We are cutting the  IRS by over $600 million. You want to  cut on top of the 600 that we’re already  cutting it. What you want to add to  what we want to add perhaps cuts the  legs out from them.  So, consequently, we have to vote  against my friend’s amendment.  ",2011

314,54,2011-02-17,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," In the  first place, our additional cuts are a  small percentage of your cuts to the  IRS and the GSA, and I hope they are  restored when we get a broader sets of  things. But the basic point  is, yes,  there were problems with 2004 and before. I believe we have a better-run  SEC now, better people who care about  it. And to punish the investors, to punish the American public because of past  mistakes by the SEC by reducing from  one year to the next is a very grave  error.  ",2011

319,54,2011-02-17,Mr.  FRANK  of Massachusetts.,"  thank the gentleman.  First of all, she wants to punish the  American  public  and  the American  I  economy because some people were not  up to it in the past. As to Madoff, we  have a new set of commissioners. It  broke in the end of 2008. We have a new  Director of Enforcement.  Yes, I want the SEC to get better,  but the notion that they can take on  complex new responsibilities regarding  derivatives and hedge funds with less  money this year than they had last  year is laughable.  For the gentlewoman’s sake, she’s for  regulation, but she voted against the  bill. It was her right to do that. And if  we’re going to relitigate that bill, let’s  do it.  By the way, many in the financial industry do not want to see these cuts  because, while  some of  them didn’t  want to see the rules, for them the  worst situation is to have the rules and  no capacity to have them promulgated  and enforced.  Yes, the SEC has made mistakes.  By the way, if the standard was that  if you’d wasted money in the past you  would lose the budget, we would be saving hundreds of billions in the Pentagon budget. That logic never appears  to apply to the Defense Department.  ",2011
320,54,2011-02-17,Mr. DICKS.," Reclaiming my time, I,  again, support the gentleman’s amendment.  Mr. Chair, since 2008 we have  faced  the  most serious  financial crisis since  the Great  Depression, and we are  just not emerging  from this difficult period. As we have debated  the Continuing Resolution  in  the House  this  week, I have urged my colleagues to consider  the impact that our near term actions will have  on unemployment and on our nation’s economy, which remains  fragile.  In  this regard  I  have deep concerns about the magnitude of  the cuts contained in the version of the Continuing Resolution  that has been drafted by  the majority  leadership, with  little  input  from  the minority.  At  this  time  I am particularly concerned  about the impact of this bill on the Securities  and Exchange Commission, which  this bill  would  cut by $189 million  from President  Obama  for Fiscal Year 2011. This  level of  spending will preclude the implementation of  the Dodd-Frank Act, meaning  that  hedge  funds, credit rating agencies, and broker-dealers will continue to operate without regulation,  therefore increasing the risk of another fiscal  meltdown. It also takes a big step backwards  toward the enforcement situation we had before the crisis, leaving the agency with fewer  staff  to  investigate potential misconduct and  police securities markets to prevent another financial crisis.  Why is this important? Look at the history:  In response to what was clearly an economic  crisis in our country in 2007–2009, Congress  established a bipartisan Commission on  the  Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis  in the United States. In its final report that was  issued in January, the Commission concluded  that the financial crisis was entirely avoidable.  It wrote:  The crisis was a result of human action  and inaction . . . the captains of finance and  the public stewards of our financial system  ignored warnings and failed to question, understand, and manage evolving risks within  a system essential to the well-being of the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:58 Feb 18, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K17FE7.143 H17FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 J K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

323,61,2011-02-17,Mr. NEUGEBAUER.," Madam Chair, I  rise in opposition to the Holt amendment.  In listening to the banter that we’ve  been hearing back and forth, you would  think that we were trying to eliminate  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but, in fact, what we’re trying to  do is limit it.  One of the things, if you look at the  history of this entity, is that it’s the  typical answer  in Washington. When  we have other regulators that aren’t  doing their job, the solution always is  let’s throw more regulation, more regulators, and more money at the problem.  And so what did we do with this new  bureau? Well, we said—guess what?—  we’re going to throw $700 million at  this new agency. We’re going to take  $500 million out of the Fed and we’re  going to give them the ability to come  and ask for another $200 million.  Now, what is going on right now is  that we don’t even have a Director at  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, yet they are standing up a new  organization. So  basically what we  have from this administration is another czar. I don’t know how many  czars that they have over there, what  the latest count is. But here we are, an  agency that has the authority to spend  millions of dollars, yet we can’t even  get one of the most egregious parts of  this right.  And it was very clever by the other  side. They realized in the last days of  the 111th Congress that there was possibly going to be a change in November. They tucked this entity over into  the Fed, trying to be able to limit Congress’ ability to have oversight over  this organization. So I want to applaud  the Appropriations Committee for figuring out a way to bring some accountability to this organization.  Now, what is at play right now is  that this entity  in August received  $18.4 million.  In December  they  received $14.37 million. And if you annualize that rate, they are going to need  less than $65 million, and yet what  we’re saying  is Republicans want to  limit that to $80 million. The Holt  amendment wants to increase that another $63 million.  Madam Chair, what is exactly wrong  and the reason we’ve been having these  hours and hours and hours of debate is  the American people spoke very clearly  last November. They are tired of Big  Government. They are tired of government trying to make all of their decisions. And what this new entity  is  going to do is it is going to hurt consumers in that it is going to drive the  cost of consumer credit up for many  Americans. Some of the financial services that they have been able to enjoy,  this new czar will have the ability to  say that those new products cannot be  offered anymore.  So bringing this kind of accountability into this process is a very positive thing. It was a mistake to put this  entity into the Fed to begin with. It’s  a mistake to let this administration  continue to stand up this organization  without going through the appropriate  this  constitutional  requirement  that  this  person be confirmed by  the United  States Senate. It’s an egregious use of  the Executive power. And one of the  things that we hope that the President  will do very quickly is nominate someone to oversee this organization.  Basically,  we  have  people  that  haven’t been nominated or confirmed  by the Senate making very big decisions, spending millions of dollars over  here, standing up an entity, quite honestly, that will not, in fact, do what a  lot of the folks in this building think  this entity is going to do, and that’s  provide  consumer  protection. What  this entity is going to do is provide  more cost to consumers.  With  that,  I urge  defeat  amendment.  ",2011

How in the world, after the massive  recession that we went through, after  all the damage that has gone through  to hit this economy, which started in  the consumer  sector, Madam Chair,  which started because consumers were  taken advantage of with no doc, low  doc loans packaged into securities and  then hedged by these credit default  swaps which Warren Buffet said caused  millions in financial destruction, how  would we want to undermine consumer  protection?  The fact is consumer protection helps  to make sure that we have a strong,  sound, and safe system. And if it would  have been in place, we would not be in  this situation now. We are in this situation now for one reason and one reason only. It is the laissez-faire attitude  that pervades the opposition to this  fair  amendment,  and  it  should  be  passed.

339,75,2011-02-17,Mr. POLIS.," Mr. Chairman, the ongoing war in Afghanistan is, quite simply, the wrong war in the wrong time  and in the wrong place. Intelligence experts agree that a terrorist threat to  our Nation does not emanate  from  within the borders of the nation of Afghanistan.  There is a very real terrorist threat  to the people of this country; but by its  very nature, it is a stateless menace. It  is a menace that is likely to use as its  base of operation wherever anarchy  prevails and wherever the rule of law is  lacking. We cannot effectively combat  this threat by occupying one country  after another after another.  It is true that, when we occupy a  country, al Qaeda and other terrorist  operations will  likely  flee  for other  areas; but there are unfortunately, Mr.  Chairman, plenty of areas of the world  that provide hospitable footholds for al  Qaeda, which is why a more effective  strategy this Nation is currently also  engaged in—but which to a certain extent  is not  complementary  to  the  heavy-handed occupation strategy—is  that of more light targeted operations  and  intelligence gathering and operations  against  terrorist  operatives  wherever they are. To be bogged down  in one particular nation state, one that  is host to a negligible number of al  Qaeda  operatives—it has  been  estimated that there are only 50 to 100 al  Qaeda operatives—is simply counterproductive to the goal of keeping the  American people safe.  Beyond being counterproductive, Mr.  Chairman, this is money that we can’t  afford.  This  amendment,  which  I  strongly support, will cut $90 billion  from the occupation of Afghanistan, allowing $10 billion to be used to safely  bring the conflict to an end and to  maintain a lighter footprint of military operations to ensure that al Qaeda  does not regain a stronghold within the  borders of Afghanistan.  It is clear, Mr. Chairman, that the  current strategy is not working. The  expenditures in Afghanistan currently  are $100 billion. That is more than $1  billion per al Qaeda operative within  the borders of Afghanistan. Most of al  Qaeda’s operations have moved across  the border to Pakistan, and they have  gained a  foothold  in Yemen. Meanwhile, we remain bogged down  in a  costly war without any clear end game  that can be articulated by the people  on the ground.  When we enter a military scenario, it  is critical to define what success looks  like. The nation-building operation undertaken with regard to the occupation  of Afghanistan does not have a clear  outcome that is reachable. The situation  there will not be better  in  6  months or in a year or in 2 years or in  3 years.  It is time to stop sending American  taxpayer money that we don’t have to  a war that does not further the security interests of the American people.  That is why I am a strong supporter of  the Nadler-Lee-Stark amendment, and  I  encourage my  colleagues  to vote  ‘‘yes.’’  I yield to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. NADLER).  b1950  ",2011
340,75,2011-02-17,Mr. NADLER.," I thank the gentleman  for his remarks and for yielding.  I just want to make one comment on  what was said a moment ago by the  gentleman from Florida. This amendment reduces funding in this CR to $10  billion. It should be enough to withdraw the troops. But the argument was  made that to reduce the funding is not  to support our troops, to rob them of  the implements of doing their job. But  the fact is that the only power that  Congress has to effectuate the war-  making power, to control whether we  should be at war somewhere or another, is the power of the purse.  We are not saying, by adopting this  amendment, we would not be saying  that we want our troops there with no  weapons and so forth. We would be saying use the funds to bring the troops  home.  It  is more supportive of the  troops to bring them home from a war  that they should not be fighting, that  is not vital to our national security, it  is more supportive to bring them home  than  it  is to give them weapons to  fight an unnecessary war  in which  some of them, unfortunately, will lose  their lives.  So I say support our troops. Bring  them home. Support the country. Stop  fighting where it doesn’t make sense,  and spend our military resources where  it helps the national security of the  United States, which is not in Afghanistan right now.  ",2011
341,75,2011-02-17,Mr. POLIS., I would simply like to  conclude that with the passage of the  Nadler-Lee-Stark amendment as part  of an underlying continuing resolution  will allow America to focus on the real  stateless terrorist threats to our Nation  by  preventing  us  from  being  bogged down in one particular occupation in a country that has no significant al Qaeda presence.  I yield back.  ,2011

345,82,2011-02-17,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the Kline-Foxx-McCarthy-  Hastings amendment, which would prohibit the use of funds by the Department of Education for the implementation of the Gainful Employment Act. I  am concerned that if this rule is implemented, it will apply an unnecessary  broad-brush approach to a complicated  situation. This rule, if implemented in  its proposed form, will effectively close  high-quality programs while  leaving  programs of questionable value open.  So this is not the way to deal with this  issue.  We all know that a college education,  whenever possible, is one of the best  paths a student can take to secure employment in a time when our Nation’s  unemployment rate  is  just under 10  percent. In some communities, it’s double that. Let’s not close off any meaningful job training programs. The Department should not forget that these  programs serve 2.8 million, and many  of  them are economically disadvantaged minority students who will lose  access to the educational opportunities  that they cannot get elsewhere. These  students are nontraditional and need  the extra assistance offered by these  flexible programs.  Supporting this amendment is supporting access and choice. Supporting  this  amendment  is  supporting  educational opportunities for minorities.  A ‘‘yes’’ vote is a vote for economically  disadvantaged students. Many of them  are the first in their families to attend  college. These students wish to have  the opportunity to attend a  flexible  program that trains them to be the  best they can be.  b2050  I urge my colleagues to understand  how important this is to be able to provide an opportunity for these young  people  in many  instances. One  incident; you cannot draw national conclusions because you know one student  that did not finish. You can pick the  finest university and the most prestigious university in this country and  you can find examples. Let us be serious. We need to provide opportunities  for people to be able to have a better  quality of life.  On that note, I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

348,82,2011-02-17,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Chairman, I join  a strong coalition of Democrats and  Republicans in urging a ‘‘yes’’ vote on  the Kline-Hastings amendment. I do so  because I believe that every student  should  be  guaranteed  the  right  of  knowing that he or she is going to get  a high quality education for every tuition dollar  they  spend and because  every taxpayer should be guaranteed  that not one dime of Pell Grant or student money goes to any school under  any ownership or management  that  does not properly spend the public’s  money. This is a goal that I believe is  shared universally by each speaker on  each side who has spoken here tonight.  Our difference is not over whether we  should guarantee  students and  taxpayers high quality and gainful employment. Our difference is over how to  accomplish that.  Here is my concern about the rule  that has been proposed thus far. It is  both under-inclusive and over-inclusive. To understand that, consider two  schools. The first school successfully  places 50 percent of its graduates in the  job for which it’s training people. So  let’s say it’s a job in medical records  technology and 50 percent of the students from that school are placed successfully. That school has a tuition  that generates a rate so that 7 percent  of the graduate’s income goes to pay  back their student  loan. The second  school successfully places 90 percent of  its graduates in the medical records  technology field, but its tuition generates a repayment rate of 10 percent.  So again the first school only places  half of  its graduates  in the  job  for  which it’s training people and the second school places 90 percent of its jobs  for which it’s training people. Under  this rule, the first school survives and  the second school is thrown out of the  program. Let me say this again. The  school with the 50 percent placement  rate continues to get taxpayer dollars,  but  the  school with  the  90 percent  placement rate doesn’t. This doesn’t  make any sense and it is the basis for  our bipartisan objection.  What should we do? If we’re going to  measure  gainful  employment,  let’s  come up with a proposal that measures  gainful  employment. Let’s  ask  the  question that when students graduate  from a school, whether it’s for-profit,  nonprofit or public, whether those students  in  fact gain employment and  whether that employment raises their  income and, therefore, is gainful. Let’s  measure what the law actually says.  Finally, I think there is the issue of  whom should make this decision. As  Chairman KLINE pointed out, as Mr.  HASTINGSpointed out, as others have,  the statutory phrase ‘‘gainful employment’’ has been with us for a very long  time. But this Congress has never chosen to define it. So the issue here is a  separation of powers issue. Who should  determine what gainful employment  means? Should it be an administrative  agency or should it be the duly elected  representatives of the people? I think  it should clearly be the duly elected  representatives of the people.  So  I would urge my  friends, both  Democrat and Republican, to vote yes  VerDate Mar 15 2010  07:29 Feb 18, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00082 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17FE7.207 H17FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 J K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

351,89,2011-02-17,Mrs. HARTZLER.," I rise in support of  this amendment.  Planned Parenthood has funded abortion from the taxpayer for too long. It  has been said that this is a threat to  women’s health. Well, Planned Parenthood isn’t about health. It’s about profit.  They have a  record of preferring  abortion over the truth. I have seen  firsthand their view of truth.  Several years ago I was a teacher,  and I taught child development. I had a  student who came  to me who  just  found out that she was pregnant. The  night before, she had visited a Planned  Parenthood clinic to discuss her options. She was 4 weeks along.  She asked a simple question, What  does  it  look  like? The answer? Oh,  don’t worry about it. It’s just a blob of  tissue. They encouraged her to have an  abortion; but, thankfully, she wanted  more information.  She and a friend came to me for information. They wanted to know if I  had pictures of what a fetus looked like  at 4 weeks old, since I taught child development. I did. She looked at the pictures of the baby with its developing  fingers and eyes and a beating heart.  Her response? She was shocked.  That’s not a blob of tissue. That’s a  baby. And then she asked this question: Why would they tell me that,  Mrs. HARTZLER? Sadly, I didn’t have an  answer. They didn’t care about  the  truth. They  didn’t  care  about  the  young woman before them. They cared  about a profit.  This pattern continues with recent  revelations that they were willing to  cover up child sexual trafficking and  child sexual abuse and aid and abet  prostitution. Where was Planned Parenthood when they had a chance to  protect young women? They turned a  blind eye. I’d call  it a war against  young women.  And yet this organization received  $363 million of revenue a year from you  and me, the taxpayer.  Hardworking men and women in this  country should not have to write a  check on April 15 to fund these abominable practices. At a time when we are  borrowing 40 cents out of every dollar  we spend and running a huge deficit,  we need to look for savings to the taxpayer wherever we can. Certainly, saving $363 million from this abortion provider is a smart and a right thing to  do, so that all Americans, born and unborn, will have  the opportunity  to  enjoy the blessings and the rights of  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  So as a woman and a mother and a  former teacher, I am proud to support  the Pence amendment, and I ask all my  colleagues  to  stand on  the  side of  truth, life, and the young women of  this country.  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

354,89,2011-02-17,Mrs. CAPPS.," I rise this evening to  speak in strong opposition to the Pence  amendment. The Pence amendment is  an attack on women’s health. This  much is clear.  What isn’t clear is what these women  who today are cared for by Planned  Parenthood doctors and nurses would  do for care if the Pence amendment  should pass.  Planned Parenthood serves 3 million  Americans every year. These are Americans who rely upon Planned Parenthood to receive their annual wellness  exams;  Americans  who  rely  upon  Planned Parenthood to receive contraceptive services to prevent unplanned  pregnancies; Americans who get tested  and treated  for sexually transmitted  infections, improving their health and  protecting the health of their community; Americans who rely on Planned  Parenthood for their cancer screenings,  tests that can detect cervical cancer or  breast cancer early, when it is easier  and less expensive to treat, saving our  entire health care infrastructure millions of health care dollars.  And these Americans cannot just go  somewhere else, somewhere that my  colleague on the other side of the aisle  would find more palatable. Sixty percent of those who use Planned Parenthood services consider it to be their  main source of health care, their medical home.  A vote to strip Planned Parenthood  of its funding is a vote to cut these  Americans off from their health care  system. Surely we can’t want that.  In my own congressional district,  Planned Parenthood of Santa Barbara,  Ventura, and San Luis Obispo Counties  serve over 31,000 patients every year. I  must ask the supporters of this mean-  spirited  amendment,  where  should  these 31,000 people go, especially now  when this reckless Republican omnibus  spending  package  cuts  community  health centers by $1 billion?  And what about your constituents?  In the amendment’s author’s own State  of  Indiana, 18,000 citizens rely upon  Planned  Parenthood  services  each  year,  18,000 Hoosiers whose  elected  Representatives  are  voting  to  shut  down their doctors’ office.  Finally, Madam Chair, I know that  the supporters of this amendment are  trying to characterize this as a vote  about abortion. It’s not about abortion.  It’s a vote about whether or not you  believe in providing women and Americans comprehensive health care. Because, despite all the misinformation  being thrown around here, 95 percent of  Planned  Parenthood  services  have  nothing to do with abortion. And as  has been strongly and firmly stated,  there are no Federal dollars used for  those receiving abortion services.  The last time I checked, 97 percent is  an A-plus, which calls into real question the motivation behind this amendment. Combined with the mean-spirited bills moving through the Energy  and Commerce and Judiciary Committees, attacking women’s health service  access, with the zeroing out of title X  family planning funds in this bill, with  a reinstatement of the global gag rule,  with a 50 percent slash in international  family planning money, and a completely  devastating  slash  to  the  Women, Infants and Children’s nutrition program, along with other cuts I  have mentioned, it adds up to only one  conclusion: House Republican  leadership is starting an all-out war on women’s health care. The targets? Women’s  insurance  coverage,  their  providers,  their health care choices.  For more than 90 years, Planned Parenthood’s doctors, nurses, and other  health professionals have been providing  health  care  to millions  of  women,  and  one  in  four American  women voters has received care from a  Planned Parenthood health center at  some point in her life.  So let’s take a stand against this attack on women’s health care. I urge a  ‘‘no’’ vote on the Pence amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

360,96,2011-02-17,Mr. CULBERSON.," Madam Chairman,  I rise in strong support of the Pence  amendment.  It’s  important  to note  that the Hyde amendment has been in  place  for  decades.  There’s  overwhelming support among the American  people that we don’t want our tax dollars used to subsidize or support abortion in any way. And people listening  to the debate tonight, those on the  floor, pro-life Democrats, no matter  who you are, shouldn’t be distracted by  the discussion of the family, the health  care services provided by the organization Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood could solve this public policy  problem they’ve got by simply refusing  to perform abortions. If they stop performing abortions this is not an issue.  If Planned Parenthood would  stop  turning a blind eye or, at best, stop  being indifferent to the criminal conduct that’s been exposed at their facilities and lead the charge to see that  criminal  complaints  are  sworn  out  against people associated with Planned  Parenthood or their employees engaged  in criminal conduct, a lot of this problem would go away. All Planned Parenthood has to do is say they’re going  to stop performing abortions. And yet  they won’t do it.  This  is not about the health care  services  that  they provide  in other  areas. This is about the fact that the  overwhelming majority of Americans  do not want our tax dollars used to  subsidize or pay for abortions. This is a  very straightforward vote tonight for  all  of  the Members  of  the House,  whether or not you will vote to permit  your constituents’ tax dollars to be  used  to  fund or  subsidize abortion.  That’s the question before the House  tonight.  It’s  not  complicated. And  Planned Parenthood is not entitled to  these dollars, these tax dollars. There’s  no  punishment  being  given  here.  Planned Parenthood, we, as a Congress  will make the public policy decision  here tonight  in this debate,  in this  vote, whether or not Planned Parenthood should continue to receive tax  dollars. That’s been decided  for decades. No tax dollars should be used to  subsidize or fund abortion. That’s been  the position of the Congress through  the Hyde amendment for many, many  decades, and we’re continuing that tradition tonight by ensuring that no tax  dollars  flow  through  Obamacare,  which, by the way, does allow our tax  dollars to be used for abortion because  what is not excluded is included, and  the Obamacare bill allows for our tax  dollars to be used for abortion by subsidizing exchange plans that provide  coverage for abortion. Therefore, this  vote is truly very simple. Will we, the  Congress of the United States, permit  our tax dollars to be used to subsidize  or fund abortion? It’s an up-or-down  vote.  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.  ",2011
361,96,2011-02-17,Mr. BROUN of Georgia.," Make no mistake about it. This is about abortion.  Just prior to coming to the floor tonight, before this debate ever began, I  was answering an email I got from a  friend of mine in Atlanta. And he said,  stop public funding of abortion. I was  talking to him on the phone when I  saw Mr. PENCE come down here and  start this debate. And he was telling  me about his sister-in-law that had an  abortion about 30 years ago. She has  nightmares. She has visions of these  two babies that she aborted.  I’m a medical doctor. I’ve performed  all  these  health  services  that my  Democratic  colleagues keep  talking  about, and  I have  for years.  I  like  women. I’m married to one. I have two  daughters. I have thousands of patients  that I’ve seen over the years, and I’ve  done pap smears and breast examinations and sexually transmitted disease  tests and all those health care services  that my Democrat  colleagues keep  talking about. This is not about that.  We keep hearing about  the Hyde  amendment. And certainly the Hyde  amendment is in place. But make no  mistake about this. What Planned Parenthood does  is the proverbial shell  game, shifting funds so taxpayer dollars still go to an organization that  provides abortion, and the more we  pour money to this organization, the  more abortions they’re going to try to  promote and provide. And,  in  fact,  Planned Parenthood was established on  the philosophy of eugenics. And they’re  still  carrying  out  that  philosophy.  There are more black babies killed  through abortion today proportionally  than there are white babies or any  other colored babies.  And we’ve also  seen  tapes where  Planned Parenthood operatives have  even promoted that type thing.  ",2011

365,96,2011-02-17,Mr. BROUN of Georgia.," So this is all  about preventing abortion. I know my  Democrat colleagues are well-meaning.  They all say the same talking points,  and I believe in the depths of my heart  that you all really believe what the  Democratic colleagues say. And I know  they’re well-meaning.  But the American people demand better. My patients demand better. The  taxpayers, your taxpayers, Democratic  colleagues, demand better.  This is about abortion. Planned Parenthood is not going to shut down if  the Pence amendment  is passed and  this continuing  resolution  is  signed  into law. Planned Parenthood won’t go  away. They can continue to supply the  services that they get from other financial sources. They can continue to  provide abortions. So it’s not going to  even stop that.  I believe very  firmly  in my heart  that we must stop abortions because  these are babies. I introduced H.R. 212,  which is the Sanctity of Human Life  Act that defines life beginning at fertilization, and I know, as a medical  doctor,  that’s when my  life began,  that’s when all of our lives began.  Those babies deserve  the  right of  personhood. They deserve the right to  live. So this debate is about life. It’s  about giving children the right to grow  up and become functioning citizens in  our society. And it’s about taxpayers’  funds continuing to support an organization, the  largest provider of abortions in the world, to continue that  process of killing babies. So we must  take the taxpayer funds away.  It’s not going to stop Planned Parenthood from doing Pap smears, breast  examinations, STD exams, all those  things that my Democrat colleagues  keep talking about. It’s not going to  stop that.  What it will do is just take taxpayers  dollars out of the equation. Planned  Parenthood can no longer do the cost  shifting, use taxpayer dollars for other  purposes besides the stated purpose of  abortion. And hopefully,  they won’t  continue to provide abortions with taxpayer dollars.  It’s not  fair  to  taxpayers. It’s not fair to women. It’s not  fair to my patients. It’s not fair to  even the Planned Parenthood patients  that are not seeking abortions.  b2300  I encourage my colleagues, let’s have  some sanity here. Let’s have some civility here.

370,110,2011-02-17,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, yesterday, Republicans in both the House  and Senate, led by Senator HUTCHISON,  introduced a resolution of disapproval  under the Congressional Review Act to  repeal the so-called net neutrality regulations recently adopted by the Federal Communications Commission.  We believe, as most Americans do,  that the Internet has transformed our  society precisely because people have  been free to create and innovate free  from government intrusion. As Americans become more aware of what  is  happening here, I suspect many will be  as alarmed as I am at the government’s  growing  involvement  in this area of  our lives. They will wonder if this is a  Trojan horse for further meddling by  the government. We intend to use the  tools available  to us  to push back  against this meddling, and I want to  thank Senator HUTCHISON for taking  the first step in our effort.  f  STIMULUS TWO-YEAR  ANNIVERSARY  ",2011
371,110,2011-02-17,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, two  years ago today, at a moment of deep  economic uncertainty,  the President  signed a bill that he said would put us  back on track. It was a plan, he said,  that would ‘‘save or create’’ up to 4  million jobs over 2 years—a figure that  he called his bottom line for success, a  plan that was supposed to drive unemployment below 7 percent by now. And  it was predicated on the notion that  government  spending—spending  borrowed money  on  government  programs—was the recipe for a rebound; a  plan that said if we ‘‘invest’’ in government, we will get out of this mess.  We were told the bill included record  investments. And then we learned what  the administration means by ‘‘investment:’’ a plant database project; a multimillion dollar facelift for the Sunset  Strip; a study of the mating decisions  of female cactus bugs; hundreds of millions of dollars to a solar panel company that was supposed to double its  workforce but ended up cutting jobs instead; massive bailouts to the States;  turtle tunnels. Senators get the drift.  Within a year of its passage, the so-  called stimulus bill had become a national punchline.  Nearly a trillion dollars was added to  the debt as a result of this bill in the  name of investing in our future. And in  the 2 years since it was signed, we have  lost millions of jobs.  And now they want to do it again.  They are back for more.  Just as amazing is the fact that the  same people who touted this bill now  refuse to cut government spending. We  learn about another wasteful stimulus  project just about every day, and they  say they can’t find a dime’s worth of  government spending to cut?  It defies common sense.  I mean, if we can’t cut a turtle tunnel when the country is $14 trillion in  the hole, we have problems. It is time  to turn over the credit card.  The bottom line here is that 2 years  after the President told us he was investing in our future, here is what we  have to show for it: higher unemployment than they predicted and trillions  more in debt.  The fact is, dangerously high debt  has actually slowed the recovery, making it harder to create private sector  jobs.  So in my view this second debate was  over before it started.  Massive government  investment of  borrowed taxpayer money as a tool for  economic growth has been a failure.  f  TRIBUTE TO PADUCAH  ",2011
372,110,2011-02-17,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  wish to recognize the people of Paducah, KY, for all of the efforts they have  made to make their city one of our  country’s best places in which to work,  visit or live. Now that hard work has  paid off. Paducah has been recognized  by  the National Trust  for Historic  Preservation as one of their Dozen Distinctive Destinations  in America  in  2011.  The National Trust for Historic Preservation seeks to recognize cities and  towns that offer an authentic cultural  and recreational experience. They take  into account a community’s commitment to the historic preservation and  revitalization of its downtown, its rich  cultural history, attractive architecture and a town’s core character. Obviously, I think Paducah ranks highly in  all of these criteria, and I am glad the  National Trust for Historic Preservation, after considering  thousands of  communities across the Nation, agrees.  The history of Paducah is a history  of life on the river. Paducah was originally settled because of its strategic  position on the Ohio River, and traffic  on the Ohio and the Tennessee River  drove  its economic development. As  rivers were America’s original highways, Paducah was founded on vital arteries of trade and commerce.  That history is still alive in Paducah  because of the hard work of many to  preserve  their  city’s  heritage. For  years I have worked along with local  leaders to enhance some of the city’s  greatest attributes; namely, Paducah’s  downtown and riverfront. Paducah is  now a vibrant river town. I would encourage my colleagues, the next time  they are planning a vacation, to keep  Paducah in mind.  The National Quilt Museum of the  United States,  the River Discovery  Center, the Lower Town Arts District,  the Upper Town Heritage Walking  Tour,  and much more  await  them  there. I will point out that the National Trust for Historic Preservation  also recently named Paducah as having  one of the most romantic main streets  in America.  The Paducah Sun recently published  an article about this high honor received by the city.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From paducahsun.com, Feb. 15, 2011]  CITYNAMEDDISTINCTIVEDESTINATION  (By Will Pinkston)  Paducah keeps adding awards to its trophy  shelf, as the city was named one of the 2011  Dozen Distinctive Destinations in America  by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  Since 2000, the National Trust for Historic  Preservation annually selects communities  across America that offer cultural and recreational  experiences  setting  them apart  from typical vacation destinations. Consideration for this honor comes with communities exhibiting a commitment to historic  preservation  and  revitalization  of  their  downtown centers, displaying their diverse  cultural history and architecture, and showing efforts to implement sustainable ‘‘green’’  concepts.  ‘‘This is an incredible honor to be named  by  the  national  trust,’’  said Rosemarie  Steele, marketing director for the Paducah  Convention and Visitors Bureau.  ‘‘There’s  strong criteria for qualifications and we’ve  met all of them.’’  Steele said several factors helped to put  Paducah in the running for the trust’s honor.  ‘‘Paducah’s history is really rich in the diversity and the prosperity of being a river  town,’’ Steele said. ‘‘The spirit of the people  who decided to save and preserve downtown,  which started years ago, and kept the moment alive, have made us a vibrant river  town.’’  The trust considered Paducah attractions,  such as the National Quilt Museum of the  United States, the annual Quilt Show, the  River Discovery Center, the Lower Town  Arts District  and Upper Town Heritage  Walking Tour.  ‘‘(The National Trust for Historic Preservation) wants to know what the hidden gems  are,  like all the creative experiences we  have,’’ Steele said. ‘‘More than 5,000 people  learn their craft in Paducah, not just quilting, but the arts, throughout lower town.’’  The National Trust for Historic Preservation  also  considered  the  city’s  ‘‘walkability,’’ according to Steele, with many of  Paducah’s historic and cultural attractions  centered within only a few blocks of one another.  ‘‘Paducah celebrates its past in a wide variety of ways, from protecting and restoring  landmark buildings to commissioning artists  to create  life-sized historic murals,’’ said  Stephanie Meeks, president of the National  Trust for Historic Preservation.

We can talk about the details certainly as we move forward, but there  was one major  issue  left unresolved  that I think deserves a colloquy so we  know what we have to do to finish this  process in conference before we adopt  an FAA bill that is a very important  bill for our country.

377,117,2011-02-17,Mr. KYL.," Madam President, very  briefly, the Senator from Texas is correct. No one who was directly involved  in these negotiations is pleased with  the outcome. Some will say that must  be a pretty good outcome then. One of  the things we did in order to enable us  to come to agreement is defer a big  issue. That issue will have to be resolved in conference. It is the issue of  how  the additional  flights  that are  being allowed under  this  legislation  will be allocated among the various air  carriers.  Ordinarily, an agency will make a decision based upon criteria the Congress  lays out in the underlying legislation;  otherwise, their decisions can be challenged as arbitrary and capricious. It is  up to us to devise what those standards  are. We were not able to agree on them.  It is one of the things we will have to  try to come to an agreement with each  other about and then articulate a position with our House colleagues in conference. This pertains both to the original or first-year tranche as well to the  second-year tranche.  I hope my colleagues and I can continue to work together in the spirit of  cooperation to devise good criteria so  the last piece of this legislation can be  put into place.  ",2011

379,117,2011-02-17,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Madam President, I wish to make a couple of observations. First of all, I apologize to all  of our colleagues having to postpone  cloture and precloture votes. What has  happened  is a number of  folks have  come in at the very last second and  asked for changes. That is not usually  the way committee business is done.  We have been on this for a number of  years. But we have to face the reality  of that fact. We want to get cloture,  and we want the bill to pass.  I say to my friend from Arizona that  I will work with him and with—whether it is GAO, DOT, or whomever we decide to work with or both, which we  can obviously do and which is in the  legislation; the GAO is automatic for  any Member—that I will work to try  and resolve this problem as best as I  can.  There are many problems wandering  around, but the basis of the bill, the  structure of the bill, the overall bill is  actually not just about slots. That is a  relatively small part. It has been virtually all of the conversation and the  debate.  As Senator HUTCHISONpointed out, a  new air traffic control system, airline  safety, all kinds of other things, are so  predominantly important that we have  had to proceed in this way to try to accommodate our colleagues, and that we  will continue to try to do.

Along with my colleagues from  Maryland, we have the airports that  are most affected by these changes, and  we have worked in that spirit of compromise. As the Senator from Arizona  noted, I don’t think anyone is totally  satisfied.  I wish to particularly single out the  ranking member and the chair for their  willingness to acknowledge our work  on the issue of the effects of these additional flights. Going up from where the  House position was and  the airport  authority’s original position was  to  make sure—vis-a-vis Dulles—that the  economic effects of this and the question  involving  the potential  shared  debt service between the two airports  be addressed. This was an issue, again,  that we were not able to resolve, but I  appreciate the chair, the ranking member and their staffs’ willingness to continue to work as this bill goes to conference.  It is very important that we get this  bill passed and we move forward on  NextGen and all the other important  parts of the FAA bill.  ",2011
382,117,2011-02-17,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Texas.  ,2011
383,117,2011-02-17,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Madam President,  there have been a lot of negotiations  on this amendment, but I do think we  now have a breakthrough and a way  forward to solve the unresolved issues  and pass a very good FAA bill.  In general, the amendment does relax  the perimeter rule, with exemptions.  There will be five new entrant capabilities—‘‘new entrant’’ meaning air carriers that do not serve National Airport now at all—and  limited  incumbents that have fewer flights from National Airport will get five new slots  that will be able to go outside of the  1,250-mile perimeter that has been a  standard restriction at National Airport. In addition, there will be seven  flights that incumbent carriers can exchange from inside the perimeter to  outside the perimeter.  Earlier the Senators from outside the  perimeter, which is basically west of  St. Louis or Denver, have wanted 75  new  flights. They came down to 30,  then they came down to 21, and now we  are at 16. That would be total because  the last four would come later, after a  study has shown that there would not  be disruptions or congestion at National Airport. So I think we have a  very limited number of flights that will  be coming in to National Airport—a  total of 16 but, of those 16, 11 are already flights that go in and out of National. Thanks to the good work of the  Senators from Virginia and Maryland,  there will be very little increase or disruption in the National Airport area.  In addition, although  the western  Senators negotiated down significantly  from what they originally wanted, the  Senators  from  the  northwest  also  wanted to have the capability for more  competition and more consumer access, and I agree with them. I think  they did a great job. Senator WYDEN,  Senator CANTWELL, Senator MERKLEY,  and Senator MURRAY also had great  concerns, along with the Senators from  Alaska, Senator MURKOWSKI and Senator BEGICH. They had concerns we had  to address. And the California Senators  most certainly have wanted more access from California, and that is a huge  population base that will now have better access to National Airport as well  as Dulles.  I think that  is the outline of the  amendment we have just adopted, and  we are going to continue to work in  conference. The House bill has five new  entrants only, and we have 16. We have  conversions; the House does not. So  there will be a lot of talk and a lot of  input, but my goal is to have more  competition, to have strengthened air  carriers for our overall U.S. air competition, and to ensure that the people  west of the Mississippi River have access to National Airport.  I think we have made a good start,  and I commend all of those who have  been involved in a very delicate negotiation. I especially thank my chairman,  of  the  Commerce Committee, for helping us  to get to this point where we could  pass an FAA bill.  As has been mentioned, we are on our  18th short-term extension of FAA, and  if we are going to have the next-generation air traffic control system, a  modernization of the air traffic control  system and the safety requirements,  we have to pass the underlying bill. So  we have taken a major first step. It is  not the end by any means, but it is the  beginning of the end.  I now recognize Senator WYDEN, who  was very much a part of resurrecting  from the dead, I would say is not too  strong a term, the amendment that  Senator ROCKEFELLER VerDate Mar 15 2010  08:49 Feb 18, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G17FE6.026 S17FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

389,124,2011-02-17,Mr. DURBIN.," Madam President, the  budget the President released Monday  includes more than $1 trillion in deficit  reduction and two-thirds of it comes  from spending cuts. That puts the Nation on the path toward fiscal sustainability. But it also reflects the urgency  to invest now in programs that will  pay off for a long time. Investing in  transportation  and  infrastructure  is  the best way to ensure economic recovery now and economic growth well into  the future.  It has been 2 years since the President signed into law the American Recovery and Restoration Act. The investments made in infrastructure over  2 years have either saved or created  over a million jobs all across the Nation. In the first year alone, that Recovery Act  led to 350,000 direct on-  project jobs. Direct job creation from  these projects has resulted in payroll  expenditures of over $4 billion.  Using this data, the House Transportation Committee calculates that $717  million in unemployment checks have  been avoided as a result of this direct  job creation.  In his State of the Union Address,  President Obama challenged us to start  rebuilding our  infrastructure  for the  21st century. Our aging network of  roads and rails was built from a long  time past. Our infrastructure used to  be the best. But let’s be honest, America has lost its lead. Mongolia has a  more advanced air traffic control system than America. South Korea has  faster and easier access to the Internet  than America. Europe and China have  high-speed rail systems far more advanced than America. Dozens of commissions,  academics,  groups,  the  smartest people in America, have all  come to the same conclusion: Our infrastructure is old and we need to invest in fixing it.  We have to reduce the debt and deficit. I was a member of the Deficit  Commission. I understand it as well as  anyone. But the American people do  not want us to do this at the expense of  critical  infrastructure  that will  be  needed to grow our economy.  Unfortunately,  the House Republicans currently are in a debate on the  floor of the House proposing that we  cut off our investments in transportation—right in the middle of the year,  right before the construction season.  House Republicans are debating that  this week.  Their plan cuts billions in funding for  roads,  rail, and mass  transit.  It  is  going to cost us over 300,000 private-  sector jobs. Let me repeat that: 300,000  private-sector  jobs;  not  government  jobs, 300,000 jobs in the private sector.  Can we afford that?  Let me give you some examples of  what  the House Republican  budget  cuts. They cut money from the Clean  Water State Revolving Loan Fund—  over $1 billion of it. That provides low-  interest and no-interest loans to our  local communities to help them build  and make safe wastewater and drinking water. Most communities cannot  afford to do this on their own without  raising  property  taxes  through  the  roof, and EPA’s funding is vital if these  projects are going to get done. This cut  alone by the House Republicans would  result in 454 fewer sewer projects and  214 fewer clean water projects across  America. And  it would cost us over  33,000 jobs.  There is a program called the TIGER  grants. Mayors know all about it because what President Obama said is, we  are going to cut out the middleman.  We are not going through the State  capitals and the State departments of  transportation. If a mayor comes to us  with a good idea of a transportation  project right at the local level, we are  going to send that money directly in a  TIGER grant.  So what did the House Republicans  decide to do? They took $1.1 billion  from  that  program. That,  unfortunately, would eliminate all funding for  this program this year, cutting off this  construction season, $500 million worth  of  investment  in our Nation’s  infrastructure. Worse, it rescinds $600 million for projects that have already been  awarded.  The Department of Transportation  announced  these projects  last year.  Now the House Republicans want to  cut them off.

390,131,2011-02-17,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, Senator  LEAHY is somewhere around here. But  since he is not on the floor, I will go  ahead and present this amendment.  This is a Leahy-Inhofe amendment.  It is on two almost unrelated things,  but the Leahy portion of the amendment extends the public safety officer  program benefits from 6 to 10 families  whose  loved ones died  in voluntary  services. It is fully offset for 10 years.  The important part of this amendment is mine, and that is—if I could  have your attention over here, and I  am speaking to the Republicans now,  we have been trying to do this for a  number of years, and Senator LEAHY  and I have agreed to this. Those of us  who have been pilots—and I have been  for 55 years—I have been involved in a  lot of humanitarian missions. What  this does is offer liability protection to  those of us who volunteer ourselves,  our money, and our aircraft to do missions no one else will do. They are humanitarian missions. The longest one I  did was all the way down to Dominica,  North of Caracas, Venezuela, through  two hurricanes, and we saved a lot of  lives down there. This would offer liability protection to those individuals  who make those sacrifices.  There are 8,000 of us, by the way,  around the country, I am sure from  every State  represented here. So  I  would encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.  ",2011

392,131,2011-02-17,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I have  no problem at all with my senior Senator’s modification to the amendment.  I am going to ask to have a voice vote  on  this  to accommodate everybody,  recognizing the late hour, but I want to  make a point. What Senator LEAHY  wants to do is great to help people. But  the one question we have not asked is—  and we are going to be asked to ask it  all the time from here forward given  where we are—is it a Federal responsibility to supply these benefits? You  can’t find it in the Constitution. You  can’t find it anywhere.  When we look at the hard decisions  we are going to have to make over the  next 2 years in terms of trimming both  mandatory programs and discretionary  programs, where we set an example  that we are going to expand something  that is not in our constitutional role,  we are making a mistake and we are  setting ourselves up for failure.

394,131,2011-02-17,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased we will finally vote on the bipartisan  amendment  that  Senator  and I have proposed. I thank  the Commerce Committee  chairman  and ranking member.  Before we vote I would like to respond to some remarks made on the  floor yesterday. The  junior Senator  from Oklahoma, Mr. COBURN, expressed  some concern with the portion of our  INHOFE amendment that makes an  improvement to the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act. As I understand one of Senator COBURN’s concerns, it is the belief  that the PSOB improvement I propose  exceeds Congress’s proper role under  the Constitution.  Section 8 of article 1 in the Constitution empowers Congress to provide for  the  ‘‘general welfare’’ of the United  States. Supporting our first responders, and encouraging more Americans  to serve their communities as first responders, who are our first line of national security, falls squarely within  this clause.  Congress can and does  legislate  in  many areas that support the general  welfare of our Nation, whether providing  funds  to  fight violent crime  through  joint  law enforcement  task  forces, or providing disaster aid to the  states following natural disasters. Congress has traditionally acted to support  our Federal system through beneficial  legislation for the states. I find it difficult to understand how supporting all  of our Nation’s first responders, on an  equal basis, exceeds Congress’s proper  and traditional constitutional role.  According to my review, there have  been 65 Federal cases concerning the  PSOB program, and not one of them  challenged  its  constitutionality.  In  1986, the Supreme Court took up a case  involving the PSOB program, which did  not involve a constitutional challenge,  and in fact invoked the Constitution’s  supremacy clause to hold that the Federal PSOB program’s benefit could not  be interfered with by any inconsistent  state law.  Senators may disagree about the wisdom or necessity of legislating for the  general welfare or in support of our  first  responders, but as a constitutional matter, Congress authority to  enact programs like the Public Safety  Officers Benefits Act  is well established.  For over 30 years, since 1976, the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program  has assisted the families of first responders lost in the line of duty, including local police, firefighters, and  EMS technicians. This policy was enacted in part to encourage more Americans to serve their communities as police  officers,  firefighters,  and  paramedics. The importance of the services  they provide is undeniable.  Senator COBURNalso expressed concern  that our amendment expanded  Federal costs. So let me be clear on  this point: while the estimated cost of  this proposal is modest—less than $13  million over 10 years our—amendment  is fully paid for through an included  offset. Let me repeat that because I  think there may be some confusion on  this point—this amendment  is completely paid for. It is deficit neutral  and will have no budgetary  impact  given the included offset.  I also heard a concern about the fact  that this amendment may not be germane to the underlying bill. If I am not  mistaken, one of the very first amendments the Senate voted on, and  for  which Senator COBURNvoted in favor  and had no procedural objection that I  am aware of, was an amendment to repeal the health care law. I do not think  that amendment would be ruled germane. Nonetheless,  in  the  spirit of  moving the legislative process forward,  the Senate voted on it.  Senator INHOFEand I have worked together to try to advance two proposals  that are important to us, and which  will both support our Nation’s first responders and encourage volunteerism. I  thank Senator INHOFEonce again, and  I urge all Senators to join us in support  of this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that letters  of support for my amendment from the  American Ambulance Association, the  National Association  of EMTs,  the  International  Association  of  Fire  Fighters, and the International Association of Fire Chiefs be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  AMERICANAMBULANCE  ASSOCIATION,  DEAR McLean, Virginia, February 4, 2011.  The Hon. PATRICKLEAHY,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  SENATORLEAHY: On behalf of the  membership of the American Ambulance Association (AAA), I am proud to convey our  strong support for Amendment No. 50 to the  FAA Air Transportation Modernization and  Safety  Improvement Act  (S.  223). Your  amendment would ensure that the survivors  of paramedics and emergency medical technicians who die in the line of duty and who  are employed by nonprofit ambulance service agencies are eligible for death benefits  under the Public Safety Officers’ Benefit  program. It would also provide much needed  liability protection to volunteer pilots.  We greatly appreciate that the amendment  is named after Dale Long who lost his life in  the line of duty in June of 2009. Dale was a  certified paramedic and provided emergency  medical care to patients for nearly twenty  five  years,  most  recently  with  the  Bennington Rescue Squad. Just two months  prior to his death, Dale was recognized by  the American Ambulance Association as a  Star of Life for his years of dedicated service  to patients. In 2010, Dale was honored by the  National EMS Memorial. Dale  is deeply  missed and we greatly appreciate your efforts on his behalf and those of thousands of  paramedics and EMTs around the country.  The ambulance service agencies and EMS  personnel which they employ, just like the  communities they serve, are unique. Communities are served by governmental and  non-profit agencies and a large portion by  for-profit  agencies.  There  is  one  characteristic, however, that is constant. When  there is an emergency, all EMS personnel,  regardless of by whom they are employed,  put their lives on the line. We therefore applaud your  leadership to make EMS personnel employed by nonprofit agencies eligible for public safety officer benefits and encourage you to ensure that eventually all  EMS personnel are covered.  The AAA is the primary national trade association  for providers of emergency and  non-emergency  ambulance  services.  The  AAA is comprised of more than 600 ambulance service operations which account for  providing services to over 75 percent of the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  08:49 Feb 18, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G17FE6.076 S17FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011
395,138,2011-02-17,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President, I  thank my colleague, Senator ROCKEFELLER, for the wonderful words about  myself, about both of our staffs, and  suffice it to say, I think the leadership  that  comes  from  the  top—Senator  ROCKEFELLER, as chairman of the Commerce Committee—has put together a  staff and a mandate for all of us such  that we are going to be a productive  committee, we are going to work together, and we are going  to  shoot  straight. And that is exactly what our  staffs do, and it is what we do.  The reason we get along so well and  have done so much is that we may not  agree on every issue, but we try to help  each other in a way that achieves the  overall goal we both want. Then we  have the room to differ on specific  ways to get there. So it is a pleasure to  be the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, and I do feel that I  am a full partner. Even though I am  not the chairman of the committee, I  do feel like the vice chairman. So I  thank the chairman.  I  think we have accomplished  so  much tonight. We haven’t passed, on  final passage, this bill, but the authorization bill that preceded this one was  passed  in 2007, and we have had 18  short-term extensions. The FAA runs  our aviation system in this country. It  is responsible for the safety, it is responsible for consumer protection, and  it is responsible for managing the air  traffic in this country and managing  the fund that helps airports with infrastructure. So  short-term  extensions  don’t work in infrastructure and in the  areas where there has to be long-term  planning. We have been trying to start  the process of the long-term planning  for the next generation of air traffic  control systems since 2007. Tonight, we  have passed a major hurdle.  The House is going along on the same  track to pass an FAA reauthorization,  and I believe we will pass the final bill,  I hope, before the short-term extension  runs out at the end of March. That will  be our goal. I think because we have  come together on this bill, we have a  good chance of doing that.  I think having the first major bill on  the floor in this session of Congress  was a big test, and I want to commend  our  leaders, HARRYREID and MITCH  MCCONNELL, for the way it was handled. HARRYREID let the process work.  We had plenty of time for amendments.  Senator MCCONNELLwas very helpful  in ensuring that amendments were not  an overload. There was no attempt to  filibuster this bill. I think this is the  way we ought to proceed for the next 2  years, and I think we have made a  great start with this bill. People have  had their say, they have had their debate time, and that, I hope, is the way  the Senate will resume.  I do want to say there were tough  issues.  The  perimeter  rule  around  Washington Reagan National Airport  was the biggest sticking point, and it  took a lot of give on all sides to assure  that the relaxation of the perimeter  rule, through exemptions, was done in  a way that, I believe, will not hurt any  of the stakeholders. I believe there is a  balance. I believe we will have more  western Senators and their constituents who will be able to have direct access to National Airport. I think we  have done right by the airlines that are  incumbent carriers at Washington National, and we have made room for new  entrants  into Washington National,  but it was very difficult.  I just want to single out a few people  who made huge contributions to this  success: Senator KYLfrom Arizona and  Senator ENSIGN from Nevada. They  represented the western  interests so  well. They know aviation and  they  knew what we could do and we have  made great progress.  I will also commend Senator WYDEN,  from Oregon, and Senator CANTWELL,  who is going to be the new chairman of  the Aviation Subcommittee  in  the  Commerce Committee. They both represented  the Northwest and Alaska  very well. Senator BEGICHand Senator  MURKOWSKIalso did so much to help us  thread the needle that would be a balanced bill.  Then there was Senator WARNER, who  also had a different interest and that  was to protect his constituents from  congestion  around Washington  National. I think we were able to accommodate the needs of the people who  live around National Airport as well,  through the leadership of Senator WARNER. It took a lot of negotiation to get  there. That is why this bill took several weeks to do.  I am very proud and pleased that we  have done this. I too want to recognize  the staffs, without whom none of us  could do the research and the detail  work that  is necessary. I will start  with Senator ROCKEFELLER’s Democratic Commerce staff. Ellen Doneski  runs the Senate majority on the Commerce Committee. She is a joy. She  and Ann Begeman, who runs the Republican side, are truly colleagues who  can shoot straight. There are never  surprises. We  trust  each other. We  don’t always agree. The answer is not  always  ‘‘yes.’’  But  the  answer  is  straight. That is what you need when  you are working together to achieve  results.  James Reid, on  this bill—I didn’t  know he was funny because, frankly,  there hasn’t been much fun for the last  2 weeks. But I am glad to know that we  have a personality  trait  that  I am  going to get to learn. But I did know he  is smart. I did know he was very helpful in the capability to work things out  with the many amendments and needs  of all of our colleagues when it is a big  bill.  Gael Sullivan, Rich Swayze, Bruce  Andrews, and Adam Duffy all helped in  this effort.  I thank the floor staffs from both  sides. They are the ones who are sitting in front of us right now. They have  been sitting  in  front of us about 9  o’clock every night that we have been  on this bill.  I thank Tim Mitchell,  Gary Myrick, Tricia Engle on the majority staff. On our side, I know we  couldn’t do without Dave Schiappa,  Laura Dove, Jody Hernandez, and all  the cloakroom staff. Honestly, I have  to say the floor staff makes the trains  run on time. They also work things out  sometimes so we do not even have to  do it. I appreciate so much all that you  all do. You are the wind beneath our  wings.  I thank, also, on our side Senator  MCCONNELL’s staff, Scott Raab, who is  the  aviation  Commerce  Committee  staff person. We appreciate his efforts  to help us keep things on track for the  leader.  Then my  own  Senate  Commerce  Committee staff. This is why I want to  say that we have a great Commerce  Committee staff, some of whom will be  leaving.  This may  be  their  final  achievement. I am very pleased they  are going to leave on such a high.  Ann Begeman  is  the chief of our  Commerce Committee  staff. As  the  chairman pointed out, she has been  given a great position, a promotion.  She has been appointed to be a Commissioner on  the Surface Transportation Board. She is going to do a great  job. In fact, I think she is accusing us  of holding up her hearing because we  like her so much. But she is going to,  in fact, have a hearing in the next couple of weeks. I know she will be confirmed because everyone who works  with her knows what a great manager  and a great leader she has been on our  staff.  I want to thank Brian Hendricks.  Brian was described by the chairman as  quietly effective—and we all started  laughing on the back bench because  Brian is a tiger. We need his brilliance  and his tenacity in all of the major  things we do on the Commerce Committee. In fact, Brian is going to be the  new incoming Chief of Staff of the Republican Commerce Committee when  Ann Begeman takes her new position  at the Surface Transportation Board.  He has  earned  this  by  leading us  through some of the toughest times,  not only this bill, where he was a help,  but also taking the lead on the NASA  bill that we also passed through our  committee. The NASA authorization  bill, that was passed through the Commerce Committee through the leadership of Brian Hendricks of all of us on  the Commerce Committee,  is saving  America’s  position  in  space  exploration. We could not have done it without Brian Hendricks. I will never forget  the contribution he has made to America. He is going to be with us for a long  time to come as well.  Jarrod Thompson was the  lead on  this bill. As the chairman said, we  VerDate Mar 15 2010  08:49 Feb 18, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G17FE6.088 S17FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

399,166,2011-02-17,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. President, today I  wish to recognize the  launch of the  first Radiologic-Pathology Correlation  Course presented by the American Institute  for  Radiologic  Pathology,  AIRP, at its new Silver Spring, MD,  venue. The American College of Radiology created the AIRP to allow radiology resident training to move forward uninterrupted by the Defense Department’s  closure  of  the  Armed  Forces Institute of Pathology, AFIP,  as part of the Base Realignment and  Closure Commission plan. The launch  of the AIRP provides an excellent example of the private sector stepping up  to help ameliorate  the  impact  that  BRAC changes can have on a community.  I am especially pleased that AIRP  chose to locate in the newly revitalized  historic American Film Institute Silver Theatre and Cultural Center, approximately 2 miles from the former  AFIP site. The AFI Silver Theatre is a  state-of-the-art education and cultural  center anchored by the restoration of  noted architect John Eberson’s historic  1938 Silver Theatre. Once slated for the  wrecker’s ball, AFI was saved through  the efforts of the local community and  reopened in 2003. Its revitalization represents a unique public-private partnership between Montgomery County,  MD, and the American Film Institute.  The launch of the AIRP at the AFI  Silver Theatre and Cultural Center  demonstrates the role the theatre is  playing as a major anchor of a redevelopment effort in Montgomery County.  Approximately 2,000 physicians annually  from around the world are expected to convene in Silver Spring for  4 weeks at a time to participate in  AIRP. With courses developed and presented by world-renowned faculty from  the most prestigious  radiology programs in the country, AIRP will further contribute to Montgomery County’s reputation as a leader in medical  research and education. I applaud the  launch of the AIRP, and I look forward  to a long and mutually beneficial relationship between AIRP and the Montgomery County community.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO ROBERT A. DENNIS  ∑",2011
400,166,2011-02-17,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I want  to take a moment to recognize the retirement this week of Robert A. Dennis, CBO’s Assistant Director for Macroeconomic Analysis. Mr. Dennis is retiring after more than 30 years of service at CBO.  He began his career at CBO in 1979,  working  as  a Principal Analyst  in  CBO’s Macroeconomic Division. He was  promoted to the position of Deputy Assistant Director of the Division in 1988  and then to the position of Assistant  Director of the Division in 1992, where  he has served since.  As the head of CBO’s Macroeconomic  Analysis Division, Mr. Dennis has been  one of the leading economists at CBO  and has helped drive the agency’s outstanding work. His skills as an economist have been highlighted in the diverse issues he has worked on while at  CBO, ranging from macroeconomic effects of tax policy, to the impact of flu  epidemics and terrorist disruptions at  U.S. ports.  Mr. Dennis has also played a critical  role at CBO by developing many of the  procedures the Macroeconomic Analysis Division has used to prepare its  economic forecasts. He even wrote the  computer software that the division  used for many years to analyze current  economic  developments  and  prepare  charts for CBO publications.  Mr. Dennis’s excellent work has been  recognized throughout his career. In  the 1980s, as a principal analyst, he received a CBO Director’s Award for outstanding performance. And he has since  received a number of awards recognizing his outstanding management at  CBO.  Mr. Dennis has exemplified CBO’s  high standard of professionalism, objectivity, and nonpartisanship. He has  worked tirelessly to ensure Congress  was given accurate and timely information on the key policy issues of the  day.  I thank Robert Dennis and commend  him for his many years of dedicated,  faithful, and outstanding  service  to  CBO, to Congress, and to the American  people. I wish him all the best in his  well-deserved retirement.∑  f  REMEMBERING CLIFFORD R.  PHILLIPS  ∑",2011
401,166,2011-02-17,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  would like to take a few minutes to  offer a tribute to Clifford R. Phillips.  He passed away on December 3, 2010, at  his home in Surprise, AZ. He was an  Alaskan fishing legend and a true hero  who fought bravely in the European  Theater during World War II.  Cliff was born on December 7, 1919, on  the west coast of Vancouver Island. His  parents, who had originally been involved in the fishing industry in England, had  immigrated to British Columbia where they managed a herring  saltery. They later moved to Ketchikan where he would, as a very young  man, begin his career in Alaskan fisheries. This was the age of ‘‘mild cure’’  salmon, and  starting at  the age of  seven Cliff began learning the family  business and the  importance of producing a high quality product. He continued to work with his father in the  family business through the 1930s.  After  seeing  the  devastation  and  heartache of the beginning of World  War II, Cliff joined the Alaska National  Guard. He trained at Chilkoot Barracks in Haines, AK, and was assigned  to duties in the Aleutian Islands. He  was one of the first to fly into the new  military airfield built in the Pribilof  Islands, which  is  located nearly 500  miles off the Siberian coast. The rugged winter saw the Islands iced in. The  base did not receive supplies by ship for  some 9 months, but Cliff and his comrades held their ground.  In September 1944, he transferred to  the European Theater and joined the  Third Army. He participated  in the  landing at Normandy, and his unit  later helped to repel the German offensive in ‘‘The Battle of the Bulge.’’ Cliff  managed to make it through combat  unscathed, and his distinguished service led to his being awarded the Silver  Star.  Upon discharge after World War II,  Cliff felt the urge to return to Alaska  and to his family heritage in the fishing industry. He naturally gravitated  back to Ketchikan in southeast Alaska  so that he could work in the waters he  knew best.  In 1950, the Phillips father-son duo  built  the E.C. Phillips cold  storage  plant on Tongass Narrows  in Ketchikan. Cliff and his father excelled at increasing capacity, efficiency, and quality. As time went by, the E.C. Phillips  product became known  for  its high  quality around the world, and today it  is still known as a premier quality  product.  After the death of his father, Cliff  took charge, but he was no desk bound  executive, and standard working hours  did not apply to him. During the fishing season he could always be found in  the processing area of his plant  inspecting the fish and supervising operations. Cliff sold his product by phone  and fax from his Alaskan office to the  entire United States and around the  world. But nothing left the plant until  he was satisfied that the fish met the  E.C. Phillips quality standard.  Before there was an Alaska Seafood  Marketing Institute, Cliff was Alaska’s  ambassador for seafood, and he traveled far and wide promoting Alaskan  seafood products. Cliff remained active  in the business well into his eighties,  but even after he retired from daily operations  and moved  to Arizona he  maintained frequent contact with the  plant and his many friends and customers.  Everyone found Cliff to be a charming man, eloquent and persuasive, but  first and foremost he saw it as his mission to insist on high quality for all  products which carried the E.C. Phillips brand name. I extend my sincerest  condolences to his wife Dixie and his  family members. We have all lost a  friend, and Alaska’s seafood industry  has lost a great champion. May he rest  in peace.∑  f  REMEMBERING NEVA EGAN  ∑",2011

403,187,2011-02-17,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, employers in several States, including Illinois,  are facing an automatic tax increase if  Congress doesn’t do something. That is  right. Businesses that are struggling in  this recession face a Federal tax coming their way if we don’t act.  I am introducing a bill today that  will prevent that. This is a time when  we need to help businesses—small businesses  in particular—to spend every  dime they have on hiring people looking for work.  Here is why I am introducing the bill.  Current  law  requires States  that  have overdrawn their unemployment  insurance trust funds to raise taxes on  employers to fill that deficit. The recession put tens of millions of Americans out of work, and the number of  people who have been unable to find  new work for more than 6 months is  unprecedented in recent history. Unemployment  insurance  has  helped  these families through a difficult time,  and it has been a good investment. It is  money that has been given to the unemployed that is quickly put back into  the  economy,  creating demands  for  goods and services.  The  Congressional  Budget  Office  ranks unemployment benefit payments  as one of the most stimulative things  we can do to turn this economy around.  So we know it is good economics. That  spending is going to help drive up demand for what private companies sell,  which encourages them to hire more  workers. But the ferocity of the economic downturn has strained the unemployment  insurance trust  fund  in  many States.  Let me be clear. This problem has  nothing to do with the operating deficits many States are facing. That is a  bigger but unrelated problem. The UI  trust funds can only be used by States  to pay unemployment insurance, and it  is these trust funds that we need to return to solvency. That is what the Unemployment Insurance Solvency Act,  which I have introduced, would do.  Here is what it specifically sets out  to accomplish:  First, it would waive the requirement  that States immediately charge local  employers higher taxes for the next 2  years. This would save companies located in my State of Illinois, for example, over $300 billion over the next 2  years and save businesses nationwide  between $8 billion and $11 billion between now and the end of 2013.  Second, it would waive the interest  payments that States would otherwise  be required to pay for the next 2 years.  That is going to save Illinois $200 million in interest payments over the next  2 years.  Finally, it gives States—Governors,  State legislatures, and local employers  working  together—greater  flexibility  in figuring out how to replenish their  unemployment trust fund starting in  2014.  It would give States three options to  explore: First, to restructure their UI  tax base and rates to fill any hole in  the trust fund; second, seek forgiveness  from the Federal Government  for a  portion of the debts the State might  owe to its trust fund in return for entering into a long-term solvency plan  with the Department of Labor to protect the interests of the jobless who  need unemployment insurance; third,  maintain  existing  solvency  that  a  State has already achieved, earning  higher Federal UI  interest payments  and lower Federal UI taxes for its employers.  The President included a version of  this proposal  in his budget he submitted to Congress on Monday. I commend him for it.  With 13.9 million people out of work  and $14 trillion  in Federal debt, we  need to find creative solutions to solve  problems facing workers and employers. This bill I have introduced, cosponsored by Senator JACKREEDof Rhode  Island and Senator SHERRODBROWNof  Ohio, is one that I think addresses this  issue in a proper manner. It removes  this new burden on small businesses, a  tax burden which can only hold them  back from hiring the people they need  and  reducing unemployment, and  it  gives to States that are hard-pressed  because of other financial problems at  least 2 years where they don’t need to  pay  the  interest  they  owe  on  the  money for unemployment insurance. It  is a stopgap emergency measure supported by the Obama administration  which I am happy to introduce.  This bill will prevent immediate tax  increases on employers. It ensures unemployment  insurance will be there  when workers need it. And it does not  raise the Federal debt. I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 386  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  08:51 Feb 18, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G17FE6.035 S17FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

418,236,2011-02-17,Mr. COURTNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor Raymond R. Elliott of Canterbury  who passed away on February 5, 2011. Ray  served his country honorably in the Vietnam  War and continued to serve his community in  various capacities throughout his life.  Ray was a past Commander at  the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post #10004 in Jewett  City. Whether it was volunteering to work in  the kitchen before a dinner or  recognizing  other veterans for their service, Ray was always ready and willing to give back. He regularly volunteered to drive disabled veterans to  their appointments within the Veterans Affairs  system and even oversaw  the program  for  some time. In 2007, I had the honor of meeting Ray and working with him to help coordinate the van driving program. I will always remember the compassion and good humor Ray  brought to this basic yet essential task.  While deeply dedicated to helping his fellow  veterans, the scope of Ray’s service within the  community was much broader. He volunteered  as a mentor at the Windham Center School,  coached Willimantic Little League baseball  and softball, and was an avid fan of UCONN  athletics.  As a beloved husband, father, grandfather,  veteran, coach, and mentor,  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ray Elliott’s life  of service to his country and community.  f  FULL-YEAR CONTINUING  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2011  SPEECHOF  HON.

419,236,2011-02-17,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Chair, I rise in support  of amendment #488 pre-printed  in  the CONGRESSIONALRECORD. My amendment is simple  and straightforward. It would fence off 24 million dollars for the ground-based augmentation  system (GBAS) which is a critical component  of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA)  next generation air traffic control system.  GBAS is in the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) National Airspace System Enterprise Architecture and  the Next Generation  (NextGen)  Implementation Plan  and  is  a  foundational operational capability  for  international aviation. Over time, as aircraft equipage increases, GBAS will allow the FAA to  decommission other ground based precision  landing aids. It also facilitates the publication  of safer, more efficient and highly accurate terminal arrival, departure and approach procedures. These more efficient  terminal procedures will help to reduce CO2emissions and  fuel burn over the long run. Further, because  of the operational flexibility of a system it will  allow airports to quickly recover from natural  disasters that can greatly deteriorate those airports landing approach vectors. But, we need  to invest in this technology to get it to a Category 3 operational standard and this takes a  commitment from the Congress, the FAA and  the airlines.  Since we are passing a year-long Continuing Resolution this will give the FAA a considerable amount of discretion in how it obligates funding for its facilities and equipment  account. The significant cuts of almost $400  million to the facilities and equipment account  could greatly hamper any true investment in  GBAS or other critical components of  the  NextGen system. It is important for us to invest in the future safety of our skies now rather than later. To date, the FAA has shown a  poor track record of supporting this critical part  of the NextGen program and we want to ensure that the FAA knows Congress supports  this important part of the program. I commend  Congressman TOMLATHAMand Congressman  JOHNOLVER, Chairman and Ranking Member  of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing  and Urban Development  and Related  Agencies for their support of this program in  the Omnibus bill.  I  look  forward  to working  with them to ensure GBAS gets the support it  deserves from the FAA.

BOEHNER,  f  PRAYER  Reverend Gene Hemrick, Washington  Theological Union, Washington, D.C.,  offered the following prayer:  Lord, in turbulent times throughout  our country and the world, may we  bring to those who seek peace the loving, uplifting heart that rings through  the prayer of St. Francis:  Lord, make me an  instrument of  Your peace.  Where there is hatred, let me sow  love; where there  is  injury, pardon;  where there is doubt, faith; where there  is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy.  O Divine Master, grant that I may  not so much seek to be consoled as to  console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love. For it is  in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is  in dying that we are born to eternal  life.  Amen.  f  THE JOURNAL  ",2011
421,1,2011-02-28,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore.," The  Chair has examined the Journal of the  last day’s proceedings and announces  to the House his approval thereof.  f  CODEL TO THE CENTRAL FRONTS  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, last week, I participated in a  congressional delegation to visit troops  and fact-find in Kuwait, Iraq, Bahrain,  and Afghanistan. Immediately upon arrival, we were given an optimistic assessment of the region by Ambassador  Deborah Jones in Kuwait.  America’s team in Baghdad, ably led  by General Lloyd Austin and Ambassador James Jeffrey,  confirmed  the  transition to an Iraqi lead is working  with the professionalism of the Iraqi  Army and police. A highlight for me  was to meet with the 151st Expeditionary Signal Battalion led by Lieutenant Colonel Richard Wholey of the  South Carolina Army National Guard  to thank them and their families for  their service.  In Bahrain, we met top officials who  assured us the reformist Crown Prince  is leading negotiations to reduce conflict in this dynamic Persian Gulf ally  where we  visited  the U.S.S. Lake  Champlain’s capable sailors.  In Afghanistan, we saw firsthand in  Kandahar  the  success  of President  Obama’s surge where a surge of 30,000  U.S. troops last year motivated a surge  of an additional 70,000 Afghans to fight  terrorism. The Kabul team of General  David Petraeus and Ambassador Karl  Eikenberry are  successfully denying  terrorists a safe haven to attack American families.  Godspeed  to  Danielle  Simonetti  Mauer, a Washington and Lee graduate, as she departs from House service  for a new career.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th in the global war on terrorism.  f  IN SOLIDARITY WITH AMERICAN  WORKERS  (Ms. MCCOLLUM  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2011
422,1,2011-02-28,Ms. MCCOLLUM.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  stand  today  in  solidarity with  the  working men and women of America.  There should be no doubt that there is  a war going on right now against workers, unions, and middle class Americans who want more jobs.  In Wisconsin, Ohio and here in Congress, workers’ rights are under attack  by union-busting politicians. It is time  for Americans to stand up and fight for  the rights of workers to organize and  negotiate for safe working conditions,  living wages, and basic benefits.  It  is  time  to  stand up and  fight  against the attacks launched by union-  busting  Republican  Governors  and  their corporate sponsors. The citizens  and legislators of Wisconsin and Ohio  who are standing up to the union-busters have the respect and appreciation  of millions of Americans.  Thank you for fighting for dignity,  respect,  freedom  and  the  rights  of  American workers  for today and tomorrow. And in Minnesota and across  America, there are freedom-loving citizens who stand in solidarity with our  brothers and sisters in Wisconsin and  Ohio.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

423,8,2011-02-28,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," I thank  the gentleman from California, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 368, the Removal  Clarification Act of 2011, will enable  Federal officials to remove cases to  Federal court in accordance with the  spirit and intent of the Federal officer  removal statute, 28 U.S.C. 1442(a). This  is a noncontroversial, bipartisan bill.  In the 111th Congress, a nearly identical version passed the House under a  suspension of the rules and passed the  Senate with an amendment by unanimous consent.  Under the Federal officer removal  statute, a Federal officer should be  able to remove a case from State court  to Federal court when it involves the  Federal officer’s exercise of his or her  official  responsibilities. The purpose  underlying the Federal officer removal  statute is to prevent State litigants  from interfering with the Federal Government’s operations. There  is, however, some ambiguity as to whether the  Federal officer removal statute applies  to State pre-suit discovery procedures.  More than 40 States have such procedures, which require individuals to be  deposed or respond to discovery requests even when a civil action has not  yet been filed. This means that Federal  officials can be forced to litigate in  State court, undermining the purpose  and intent of the Federal officer removal statute.  Courts are split on whether the removal statute applies to pre-suit discovery. Some courts have found that  Federal officers cannot remove a proceeding to Federal court when these  pre-suit discovery motions are at issue  while others have found that such proceedings could be removed. This bill  will clarify that Federal officers should  be able to remove a proceeding to Federal court any time a legal demand is  made for a Federal official’s testimony  or documents if the officer’s exercise of  his or her official responsibilities was  at issue.  The legislation will also allow a Federal officer to appeal a district court’s  decision to remand the matter back to  the State court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1447. This bill will not result in the removal of the entire State case when a  Federal officer is served with a discovery request when the only hook is  that a Federal officer has been served  with such a discovery request. Rather,  the bill we consider today makes clear  that ‘‘if there is no other basis for removal, only that discovery proceeding  may be removed to the district court.’’  Finally, the bill makes clear that the  timing  requirement under  28 U.S.C.  1446 will not be changed, restating the  30-day requirement  for removing the  case when the judicial order is sought  as well as when the judicial order is enforced.  In closing,  I would  like to thank  Chairman SMITHand Ranking Member  CONYERS for working with me on this  bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan piece of  legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2011
424,8,2011-02-28,Mr. DANIEL E.," LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, once again I would  like  to  thank  the  gentleman  from  Georgia for bringing this bill to the  committee and to the floor. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.  ",2011
425,8,2011-02-28,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today in support of the amendment to  H.R. 368,  ‘‘The Removal Clarification Act of  2011.’’  ‘‘The Removal Clarification Act of 2011’’  clarifies when a case involving a federal official can be removed from a state court into a  federal court.  It states  that a  federal official  can remove cases to federal court in accordance with the spirit and intent of the federal officer removal statute.  It  is also makes clear  that the federal officer removal statute applies  to all federal officials, including officials of the  legislative and executive branch of the Federal  government.  The purpose of the law is to take from state  courts the indefeasible power to hold a federal  officer or agent criminally or civilly liable for an  act allegedly performed  in  the execution of  their federal duties. This does not mean federal officers can break the law; it just means  that these cases are transferred to U.S. district  court  for consideration. Federal officers or  agents, including congressmen, should not be  forced to answer for conduct asserted within  their federal duties in a state forum that invites  local interests or prejudice to color outcomes.  In the absence of this constitutional protection,  federal officers,  including congressmen and  women, would be subject to political harassment and federal operations generally would  be needlessly hampered.  H.R. 368, introduced by my colleague Rep.  HANKJOHNSONof Georgia, is a non-controversial, bipartisan bill  that was passed by  the  House and passed  in  the Senate with an  amendment at the end if the 111th Congress.  Just about a month ago, we considered this  bill in the House Judiciary Committee, and it  received support from my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle.  Currently under 28 U.S.C. 1442(a), federal  officials are able to remove a case out of state  court and  into  federal court. However under  state per-suit discovery laws, federal officials  may be unable to remove the case because a  ‘‘civil action’’ has not yet been filed.  H.R 368 does not make any changes to the  underlying removal law. It simply clarifies 28  U.S.C. 1442(a) by including any proceeding to  the extent that in such a proceeding, a judicial  order, including a subpoena for testimony or  documents, is sought or issued.  In my home state of Texas, there was a recent high profile case, Price v. Johnson, involving  a Texas  state  legal  action  taken  against Rep. JOHNSON, where the removal to  federal court was denied by the U.S. District  Court. The Fifth Circuit illustrated the importance of better clarity needed  in 28 U.S.C.  1442(a). In the 111th Congress, the Judiciary  Committee’s Subcommittee on Courts and  Competition Policy found that case law interpreting  the  removal statue  is not  just split  among  the circuits, but within  them as well.  Therefore, H.R. 368 is a much needed measure  to once and  for all settle  the confusion  amongst rulings in the Federal District Courts.  Currently, there are 47 states that have enacted pre-civil suit discovery statues; H.R. 368  would take into account the operation of these  state pre-civil suit discovery statues and provide clarification  to prevent more cases  like  Price v. Johnson from occurring.  H.R. 368  is essential  to  the  integrity and  preeminence of the federal government within  its realm of authority. This bill will also allow  for appeal  to  the  federal court  if  the district  court remands the matter. back to the state  court and that the federal defense is also still  needed for removal.  I ask my colleagues  to please  join me  in  supporting H.R. 368, ‘‘the Removal Clarification Act of 2011.’’  ",2011

I appreciate greatly your  organizing this opportunity for us to  speak this evening on something that  is exceedingly important to this country, and that is the history of African  Americans in America.  African Americans are no different  than any other Americans. We are all  the same. There is only one race—the  human race.  To a certain extent, I always have  some degree of consternation whenever  we have a black history celebration or  occasion such as this. I have this degree of consternation because I really  think we should just have one history,  and it really should be American history; but we have these occasions because some of the accomplishments of  some Americans have not been properly acknowledged, and as a result, we  want to make sure that American history includes the history of all Americans.  So we talk about the history of African Americans, the history of Africans  in the Americas—in the United States  of America, if you will. Many names  come  to mind. We always mention  Thurgood Marshall. We always mention Rosa Parks. We always mention  the great heroes and heroines who have  been on the forefront of making America great.  Today, I would just like to mention  nameless faces, persons who have never  made headlines, who work full time,  who take care of the family, who pay  taxes, who have never complained by  way of a protest, a march. They have  done  their duty as citizens  in  this  country, and I want them to know that  there are those of us who pay attention  to the fact that they, too, have made  America  great. They  are  nameless  faces in the crowd, but they have made  a great statement by being honorable,  hardworking, law-abiding citizens.  To those who continue to do their  duty as citizens, we thank you for what  you have done. We want you to know  that we who have been honored to  serve  in the Congress of the United  States of America will not allow the  rollback of the clock on many of the  programs that are of benefit to all  Americans. This will include, of course,  those of benefit to African Americans.  We will fight to protect the Department of Education. It means something  to have a Department of Education in  this country, especially to persons who  at one time were lawfully denied the  right to get an education. We will fight  to protect laws that fight discrimination. Lilly Ledbetter v. Goodyear involved an Anglo lady, but that case had  implications far beyond any given ethnic group.

To the Senate:  Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3,  of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby  Senate  appoint  the  Honorable  A.  COONS, a Senator from the State of Delaware, to perform the duties of the Chair.  CHRISTOPHER DANIELK. INOUYE,  President pro tempore.  Mr. COONS thereupon assumed the  chair as Acting President pro tempore.  f  RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the  leadership time is reserved.  f  READING OF WASHINGTON’S  FAREWELL ADDRESS  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the Senate of January 24, 1901, as amended by  the order of February 17, 2011, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. ISAKSON, will  now read Washington’s Farewell Address.  Mr. ISAKSON, at the rostrum, read  the Farewell Address, as follows:  To the people of the United States:  FRIENDS ANDFELLOW-CITIZENS: The  period for a new election of a citizen to  administer the executive government  of the United States being not far distant, and the time actually arrived  when your thoughts must be employed  in designating the person who is to be  clothed with that important trust, it  appears to me proper, especially as it  may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I should  now apprise you of the resolution I  have formed, to decline being considered among the number of those out of  whom a choice is to be made.  I beg you at the same time to do me  the justice to be assured that this resolution has not been taken without a  strict regard to all the considerations  appertaining  to  the  relation which  binds a dutiful citizen to his country—  and that, in withdrawing the tender of  service which silence in my situation  might imply, I am influenced by no  diminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful respect  for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction that the  step is compatible with both.  The acceptance of, and continuance  hitherto in, the office to which your  suffrages have twice called me have  been a uniform sacrifice of inclination  to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would  have been much earlier in my power,  consistently with motives which I was  not at liberty to disregard, to return to  that retirement from which I had been  reluctantly drawn. The strength of my  inclination to do this, previous to the  last election, had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to  you; but mature reflection on the then  perplexed and critical posture of our  affairs with foreign nations, and the  unanimous advice of persons entitled  to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.  I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as internal, no  longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment  of duty or propriety and am persuaded,  whatever partiality may be retained  for my services, that in the present circumstances of our country you will not  disapprove my determination to retire.  The impressions with which I first  undertook the arduous trust were explained on the proper occasion. In the  discharge of this trust, I will only say  that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and  administration of the government the  best exertions of which a very fallible  judgment was capable. Not unconscious  in the outset of the inferiority of my  qualifications, experience in my own  eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of  others, has strengthened the motives  to diffidence of myself, and every day  the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade  of retirement is as necessary to me as  it will be welcome.

440,36,2011-02-28,Mr. CORKER.," Mr. President, I had  the opportunity to speak with you in  the last several moments, and you had  a couple questions about the CAP Act  that I was just discussing on the floor.  The Presiding Officer had some great  questions about what it takes to overcome the CAP Act, in the event we  were able to pass it.  It is just a 10-page bill. It is very eloquent.  It  doesn’t  have  a  lot  of  ‘‘whereases.’’ It is just a business document that takes us from where we are  to where we need to be. But, in essence,  to override it, it would take a two-  thirds vote. It would take two-thirds of  the House and the Senate to actually  override or get out of the straitjacket,  if you will. There were previous bills,  such  as Gramm-Rudman  and  other  types of bills that tried to keep Washington fiscally focused, and those bills  required 60 votes. So this would be a  higher threshold.  So, yes, if there was some type of national emergency and we needed to  move beyond this straitjacket  for 1  year or 6 months or something like  that, a two-thirds vote could do that. I  mean, 67 votes is a pretty tough threshold, and hopefully  it  is the kind of  threshold necessary to keep the kind of  discipline in place that we need.  So it is a 10-page bill. Again, it is  very eloquent. I think it lays out a solution for us that hopefully will be a  part of anything we do over the next  several months.  I understand, after talking with the  Presiding Officer over the last several  days, while traveling to these various  countries, that he, along with many of  our other colleagues—I know I did myself—came here to solve problems, not  to message. In a body such as this, it is  tough to solve these kinds of problems,  but the only way to do it is to offer a  pragmatic solution.  I know there are some people who are  interested, sometimes, in messaging. I  have tried to offer something that I  think will take us from a place that is  very much out of line in spending to a  place that is more appropriate.  I might also say I thought the President’s  deficit  reduction  commission  had some very good points as it relates  to tax reform. I think all of us are  aware of the $1.2 trillion in tax expenditures that exist.  I was doing an event over the last  several days, and a gentleman raised  his hand and asked me: What do you  mean by tax expenditures? Isn’t the  money ours until we give it to the Federal Government? Why would you call  it a tax expenditure?  I think people realize in our Tax Code  there are all kinds of exclusions and  subsidies and  favored companies and  favored this and favored that. If we did  away with all of those, there would be  $1.2  trillion we could use  to  lower  everybody’s rate, and we could make  our Tax Code much more simple. The  deficit reduction commission says we  could take our corporate rates  from  where they are down to a level of about  26 percent—somewhere between 23 and  29  percent—and  lower  everybody’s  rates individually. I think most Americans, instead of filling out all these  forms to see if they benefit from these  various  subsidies and credits, would  much rather know that everybody is on  the same playing field; that some favored company is not in a situation  where they are more favored than another; that everybody is on the same  basis.  I think there has been some good  work done there. I hope we are able to  take votes on that over the next several months. But there is a very elegant, pragmatic solution that has been  offered that would go hand  in hand  with these types of measures and would  cause us, over the next 10 years, to exercise the kind of fiscal discipline this  country needs to confront what I think  threatens our national security, certainly  our  economic  security,  even  more than the things we saw on the  ground in the Middle East last week.  With that, I suggest the absence of a  quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",2011

He has been one of  the leaders the whole time I have been  on that committee with regard to intellectual property  issues. It has always been a pleasure to work with him  and his staff. They are good people.  This is a particularly important bill.  It is only the first step, once we bring  it up and hopefully pass it, and then  the House will bring up  their bill.  There are likely to be differences between the two, and we will have to get  together in conference to resolve those  differences. So those who might have  some angst about this particular bill,  give it time.

Otherwise, every one  of us would be asking for one in our  State. Vermont, which receives more  patents  per  capita  than  any  other  State in the Union, would be asking for  one, and so forth. He does not try to  tilt the balance in favor of a particular  State but he calls for geographic diversity. That  is very wise. When  the  amendment comes to a vote, I will be  there to support it.

467,57,2011-02-28,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, Senator  RISCHand I are here today—in fact, I  note we are joined on the floor by our  former colleague Senator Larry Craig—  to honor one of Idaho’s greatest statesmen who passed away on Saturday. We  rise to honor the distinguished life of  Senator James A. McClure, a mentor  and a dear friend of mine. As I indicated, Senator Craig is here. Senator  Craig is the one who followed Senator  McClure into the seat in the Senate.  We appreciate him making the effort  to get here to also share his concerns  and condolences, and frankly, to help  honor Senator McClure.  I join Senator McClure’s wife Louise  and their family and friends and all of  Idaho in mourning the passing of Senator McClure and honoring his great  legacy. His sound guidance, strong advocacy for Idaho, and his personal encouragement will be missed by all of  us, but definitely not forgotten.  Throughout his  decades  of  public  service, Jim McClure set a standard for  public servants that will endure  for  generations.  Senator McClure  dedicated much of his  life to honorable  service to our Nation. At the age of 18,  he  joined the U.S. Navy and served  honorably in World War II. He then returned  to  Idaho  and  attended  law  school  at  the University  of  Idaho,  worked as a prosecuting attorney for  Payette County, and  served  in  the  Idaho State Senate. With 6 years in the  U.S. House of Representatives, and 18  years in the U.S. Senate, his exemplary  service  in  the Congress  spanned  24  years.  His unfailing good will, respect for  others, and his essential Western conservatism  helped  him  to maintain  throughout his life the kind of service  that is still the best model for how to  engage in today’s public policy debates.  He was recognized by all as a gentleman but a powerful advocate.  Senator McClure’s legacy as a Congressman and a Senator is broad, and  on many issues, such as energy and  natural  resource management,  his  service to Idaho is historic. Jim utilized his service as chairman of the  Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to advocate for Idaho  issues and their ideals. He also helped  to guide the Senate through his chairmanship of the Senate Republican Conference from 1981 to 1985. Jim worked  diligently to achieve solutions to Idaho  and national challenges. He also had a  forward-thinking  focus on  fiscal discipline—one that we could well use in  the Senate today—and on energy independence, another critical issue which  we continue to battle for today. These  are critical issues he helped set the  foundation for and, frankly, which his  wisdom would have helped to solve.  Jim was a friend and a role model for  me and I am sure for many others in  Idaho and throughout the Nation. His  dedication, kind treatment of others,  and skillful proactive and principled  approach are long going to endure. He  will be sorely missed, but his lifetime  of accomplishments will be with the  people of Idaho forever.  I offer my sympathy and my love to  Louise and to the entire McClure family and to Jim’s many friends and associates.  Mr. President, I yield the time to  Senator RISCH.  ",2011

470,134,2011-02-28,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  the World Champions, winners of Super Bowl  XLV, The Green Bay Packers of Title Town. I  ask that this poem penned in honor and remembrance of  them by Albert Caswell be  placed in the RECORD.  THEPACKISBACK, ANDHOW!  In this game of old,  upon these hardened fields of frozen tundras  so . . .  But came the birth,  of one of the NFL’s greatest teams to be behold . . .  of most hallowed Green and Gold!  Were born,  The Green Bay Packers of such fame known  so,  because of their Championships,  the name Title Town they now so own!  As the only Professional team across this nation,  in any sport, who is so owned by. . .  ‘‘WE The People’’ this fine equation!  As The Legend Vince Lombardi,  ‘‘so ruled The Lombardi Nation’’ . . .  and his most hallowed teams, virtually defined . . .  the very definition of what the word football  means!  And from this Title Town so came,  the very first two Super Bowls win to claim,  as a Starr was born who in The Hall now remains!  As it was not too long before,  when a man named Brett went Favre . and gave to this Title Town again,  .  . . .  . . Big  . clash of the  another Super Bowl win once more!  As then later in later years,  a new kid in town as so appeared . . .  like The Young Man to Montana Man,  now Brett to Rogers, both had to stand!  Back to Back! Man to Man!  Replacing an Icon . . . as Rogers knew,  he’d have to go ‘‘The Longest Yard’’ to live  that dream!  And now the stage was set,  in Super Bowl XVL so yet . Titans,  Pittsburgh and Green Bay, who would survive?  Would Steel bend, or Cheese give way?  As it was these two early teams,  that so helped give the NFL its great name!  As the two rode into Texas for the game,  for this up and coming war,  as a shootout at the OK Corral for sure!  But, only one team . . .  can so wear that most hallowed crown,  that of World Champions of so renown . . and hold that Lombardi Trophy up high,  up so very proud!  As it was to be,  the young gun versus the proven one . Ben,  and the new Kid Rocket Rogers with cannons,  blazing both ones!  Who would win, and Be The Best?  But, Aaron could not spell the word DOUBT,  even if you spotted him the first five letters  no less!  And still another great question lie here so!  Which is greater, Cheese or Steel . . . yo?  As so soon, 111,000 viewers would know!  As The Pack had something to prove,  with so many players on the DL . . .  they had their own Special Mash Unit too!  While, it did not take long,  before Rogers threw strong . . and hit Jody with a 29 TD . . .  As he put a Full Nelson on the Pittsburgh D!  Then, in the Nick of time . . .  Big money Collins,  cashed in his own private Benjamins,  intercepting, a 37 yd return crossing the goal  line!  As on that very same play,  Kemoeatu, gave Big Ben ‘‘The Kemo Treatment’’,  running over him, showing him The Packer  Way!  Already you could so see, in disbelief . . .  as all over those powerful Pittsburgh Steelers,  some Rust was starting form, starting to  creep!  As, Matthews 52 cried out . . .  you better get the trainer quick . and get some Rustoleum on that,  or your all going to be eating cheese!  And then after a Steelers field goal,  Big Ben was Bushwhacked by Jarrett so,  with an interception . . . as man that was  cold!  Then, using Laser Technology,  for a TD to Jennings so sweet . . as Rogers drilled a rope for 7yds,  that exploded oh so very brilliantly!  As it looked like Polamalu number 43,  and all of the entire Steelers football team,  were having a bad hair day indeed,  yea it was not looking very pretty!  When, suddenly before the half time,  Hines Ward, had something else in mind . a great TD, reinforcing The Steel you see!  As it was at the end of a 77yd drive,  once again Big Ben came alive,  because the great one earlier,  Woodson, got hurt breaking up a play as he  dived!  But Pittsburgh apparently,  liked what they served at the halftime show,  helping them grow those Black Eyed Peas so!  .  .  .  .  . . five consecutive  Scoring a touchdown on  runs,  from the 50yd line where it all begun . . .  as Mendenhall scored with an 8yd TD, this  one!  The Steelers were bent,  but not yet broken . . . until Matthews,  molded Mendenhall into human Clay,  with his fumble so, Captain Crunch had spoken!  And with the game on the line,  Rocket Rogers say ‘‘Roger That’’,  yea one more time!  Living Large, with a 55yd drive into a TD!  As once again, on Jennings looked so splendidly,  with an 8yd throw . . . the man’s got speed,  telling all of those Terrible Towels . . . to  eat cheese!  As somehow again, The Tower of Big Ben  . . .  struck one more time, in the end zone to  Wallace . . .  who is too, was built for speed!  But, the coolest of cool . . .  as Rogers nerves of steel ruled!  Driving down the field,  for a Masonic Moment as he would not yield!  With Crosby, on the road to victory . . .  As he made the kick,  the Steelers were getting sick,  and needed a drive, as those terrible towels  began to cry!  But time ran out on Big Ben,  as Rogers cried it’s time for the belt my  friends . . .  feel my disease,  as the price of steel began to descend!  As The Black and Yellow, turned to jell–O  . . .  turned to jell-o . er’s D,  put their stamp of Wiscousin Cheese . them!  While, somewhere up in Heaven,  an Angel named Lombardi cries,  ‘‘The Pack is Back,  we’re on Top!’’ now with tear in his eye!  It was a heck of a game, as records were broken . . .  as over 111,000 people watched what was spoken!  The word TEAM, what McCarthy was invoking!  As he, had a lot legends to live up to . . .  and some tough shoes to fill, along the way!  But, now he’s shown the nation what he can  do!  It was one heck of year, as against all odds  . . .  a new World’s Champion been named,  just like the old Lombardi team’s so true!  Against all odds, in the way they were led,  from The Coach on down . . . what it said,  as a new Star who was found, ‘‘Rogers That’’!  Yea, once again THE PACK IS BACK,  AT THE VERY TOP OF THE PACK . . ALL IN THAT GREAT TITLE TOWN!  And in the end, the Nation found!  That Cheese is far stronger than Steel!  So don’t look back, were gaining on you  now!  Were only two away from six,  in this hallowed Title Town!

476,22,2011-03-04,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  wish to thank and honor David Kris,  who is leaving his position this week as  the Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the Department of  Justice, DOJ.  Many of us in Congress—especially  those of us on the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee  who work closely with the administration on national security issues—are  very sorry to see David Kris leave DOJ.  As one of the Nation’s leading experts on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, I will personally  miss hearing from David, especially as  the Congress moves to extend the sunsets on important provisions of FISA  this spring. He testified with clarity  and precision on issues of great complexity in all of his appearances before  the Senate. I valued his insights.  Congress created the position of Assistant Attorney General for National  Security in 2006 to bring together the  intelligence and the counterterrorism  and counterespionage prosecution functions of the Department of Justice.  Over the past 2 years, building on the  professional,  nonpolitical  foundation  established by his predecessors, Kenneth Wainstein and Patrick Rowan,  David has managed the National Security Division in what has been, arguably, the most dangerous period since  the September 11 attacks.  Since David was sworn in at DOJ on  March 25, 2009, terrorism investigations  and prosecutions have been unfolding  E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o at an unprecedented scale and pace.  Consider  the  following high  profile  counterterrorism arrests and prosecutions involving the National Security  Division: the al-Qaida plot to bomb the  New  York  subway  system  by  Najibullah Zazi; the attempted bombing of Times Square by Faisal Shahzad;  the attempted bombing of flight 253 on  Christmas Day 2009 by Umar Farouk  Abdulmutallab; the arrest and prosecution of David Headley, an American  who helped plot the Mumbai attacks;  and  the  arrest  and  prosecution  of  Hosam Smadi who was sentenced to 24  years in prison last year for plotting to  blow up a Dallas skyscraper.  Under David’s  leadership,  the National Security Division also played an  important role in the investigation and  prosecution of a number of significant  espionage, export control enforcement,  and leak cases. In the summer of 2010,  David played a prominent role in the  arrest  and  swap  of  illegal Russian  agents. He directed the prosecutions of  Cuban spies, illegal exports of fighter  jet engines and parts to Iran, and assistance to China in designing stealth  cruise missiles. During his tenure, the  National Security Division joined the  Criminal Division in prosecuting more  leak cases than ever before.  David Kris joined DOJ in March 2009  after being confirmed unanimously by  the U.S. Senate. He had previously  served in the Justice Department from  1992 to 2003 as an attorney in the Criminal Division and as Associate Deputy  Attorney General.  I know that prior experience at DOJ  served David well because once he was  sworn in, he went to work right away  to develop partnerships with the Intelligence community, the National Security Council, and Congress.  And I know David worked hard to ensure that the relevant agencies and entities were aware of the National Security Division’s activities and that its  activities were properly  coordinated  with the intelligence community and  the Defense Department.  It has been clear to us that David  made it a priority to ensure that FBI  national security investigations were  conducted in accordance with the Constitution,  statutes,  and  applicable  guidelines. David also expanded  the  number of oversight attorney staff in  his division and, as a result, the division’s oversight section exceeded  its  annual goal for national security reviews for the first time in its history.  I wish David Kris well in his future  endeavors in the private sector. His replacement will have big shoes to fill.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  which were referred to the appropriate  committees.

A joint memorial adopted by the  Legislature of the State of Washington relative to adult offender supervision; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.  SENATEJOINTMEMORIALNO. 8026  Whereas, the state of Washington is an active and participating member of the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision and has supported the terms of the  Interstate Compact since 1937; and  Whereas, the state of Washington suffered  a grievous loss when four police officers were  killed by an offender under the supervision  of the state who had been transferred to  Washington state under the terms of the  Interstate Compact; and  Whereas, the public safety of the citizens  of the state of Washington are of the utmost  concern and importance to this body; and  Whereas,  the  state  of Washington has  grave concerns about continuing to operate  under the terms of the Interstate Compact  without the tools to adequately protect its  citizens; and  Whereas, the existing rules and processes  in the Interstate Compact do not provide the  receiving state with sufficient information  and authority to adequately supervise and  address the violative behavior of an offender  transferred to the receiving state under the  terms of the compact;  Now therefore, your Memorialists respectfully pray that the Interstate Commission  for Adult Offender Supervision immediately  initiate its emergency rule-making process  to consider and adopt rule amendments that  will provide the receiving state with all information known to the sending state about  the criminal history and behavior of an offender whose transfer is sought, and to vest  the receiving state with the authority to determine when the receiving state can no  longer safely supervise an offender and the  offender must be returned to the sending  state or, in the alternative, that these issues  be addressed through federal legislation.  Be it resolved, That copies of this Memorial  be immediately transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the United  States, the Executive Director and Chairperson of  the  Interstate  commission  for  Adult Offender Supervision, the President of  the United States Senate, the Speaker of the  House of Representatives, and each member  of Congress from the State of Washington.  f  INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND  JOINT RESOLUTIONS  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the first  l a e n b j VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:40 Nov 01, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S04MR1.REC S04MR1         ",2011

We’ve got a permitting  process that is failing America. And we  have an opportunity  today  to  show  America just how bad that problem is.  Later today, I’m going to be introducing a bill called the ROAD to Jobs  Act. It stands for regulatory openness,  accountability, and disclosure. And we  are going to show the American people,  through a report that is going to be required from the Council on Environmental Quality, just how flawed that  permitting process is, requiring them  to show the permits that are in cycle  and what the economic  implications  are of not authorizing permits to go  after America’s resources.  f  ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND  SPENDING CUTS  (Ms.  SCHWARTZ  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2011
478,2,2011-03-11,Ms. SCHWARTZ.," Last week, we saw  real signs of economic recovery when  the unemployment rate dropped below  9 percent for the first time in 2 years.  This is encouraging news, but we still  have a long way to go to promote private sector growth.  The Republicans are digging  their  heels in on billions of dollars of reckless cuts that threaten our economic  growth and put 700,000 American jobs  at risk. We agree that spending cuts  are necessary to reduce the deficit.  This is not about whether to cut or  not. This is about where to cut, how  much to cut, and how fast to cut. The  Republican agenda threatens our core  obligations to our seniors, to our safety, and to our future.  We need disciplined budgeting. We  need targeted cuts that won’t hurt our  economy. And we need strategic investments to make America competitive  for future generations. Republicans are  putting  partisan  politics  ahead  of  American priorities. Instead of enacting job-destroying cuts, we should be  focusing on  job creation and  sound  budgeting.  Enough is enough. It’s time to get serious and pass a responsible spending  plan that grows the economy and invests in the future.  COMMENDING THE WORK OF THE  U.S.-INDIA BUSINESS COUNCIL  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I rise to commend the work of  the  U.S.-India  Business  Council.  Founded in 1975, the primary mission  of the USIBC is to strengthen bilateral  investments and trade between our two  great nations. America and India now  share $50 billion in annual trade that  mutually benefits both countries. Our  two democracies—the world’s  largest  and the world’s oldest—have held joint  military exercises, increased two-way  tourism, and have engaged in bilateral  cooperation on many fronts, including  the global war on terrorism.  Thanks to the leadership of President  Ron Somers, the USIBC, hosted by the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has grown  to 400 member companies creating jobs  in America. Indian businesses have invested billions across the Nation, including Mittal Steel  in Georgetown,  South Carolina. For 36 years, USIBC  has opened the doors of American businesses in India, creating jobs in both  countries as strategic partners.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th in the global war on terrorism.  I cherish  the memory of Addison  Morton Graves, who passed away 50  years ago on March 8.  f  b0910  BURDEN OF BUDGET CUTS  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2011
479,2,2011-03-11,Mr. YARMUTH.," Mr. Speaker, we are  engaged in a process now and over the  next week to decide how we are going  to fund the government for the next  few months and for the next year. Republicans have already decided where  they want to put the burden of the cuts  that we all know we have to make in  the budget. They want to put them on  the least fortunate of our country.  Let me  read  something  from The  Washington Post this week written by  Harold Meyerson. Mark Whitehouse of  the Wall Street Journal looked at how  businesses were dividing up the pie 18  months into every previous recovery  since 1947 and found that 58 percent of  their increases in productivity trickled  down  to  their workers  in  increased  wages. What has happened today is the  other way around: Only 6 percent of  productivity gains have gone to our  newly more  productive workers.  In  other words, our people, our working  families have already paid the price.  What have the corporations and businesses done with that profit that they  have made? Mostly, they are buying  their stock back. They are not hiring  people or investing in research. So as  we decide where we are going to tighten the belt as we move forward on our  budget, let’s make sure that we tighten  it on the fat cats as well as the people  who have already been strangled.  f  BICYCLING ADVOCATES OFFER  POSITIVE MESSAGE OF HOPE  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2011
480,2,2011-03-11,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I  would like to thank the hundreds of cyclists, parents, business people, and especially  bike  industry  leaders who  flooded Capitol Hill this week with a  message of bike partisanship. They  were addressing the issues found on the  front page every day in our newspapers  about what would happen if we made it  easier to use the most efficient form of  urban transportation ever designed. It  would make a huge difference to the  health of our  families, dealing with  traffic congestion and air pollution,  and reduce the tyranny of our addiction to oil if we burned more calories  and less fossil fuel.  It is also big business. Billions of dollars are made from the sales, service,  manufacturing, and bike tourism. And  most important, it makes our communities more livable, our families safer,  healthier, and more economically secure.  Thank you, cycling advocates,  for  your positive message of hope. I hope  that it found receptive ears here on  Capitol Hill.  OPPOSING EDUCATION SPENDING  CUTS  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of  Texas asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)  ",2011
481,2,2011-03-11,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of  Texas.," Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to sit  and not say anything about how we are  damaging our future. We cannot consider the kind of cuts that are proposed  to our future and think that this country will be prosperous. This plan eliminates the funding for math and science  partnerships. We must make strategic  investments  in STEM  education  in  order to maintain a competitive workforce.  This  plan  eliminates Even Start,  Reading is Fundamental, and Striving  Readers. It cuts more than $1 billion  from Head Start. This  represents a  massive  setback  for youth who are  most in need. This plan is especially  damaging  for our youngest children  just beginning their academic careers.  These children will fall behind before  they even get started. The Reading is  Fundamental  program  has  provided  books for young children whose families cannot afford them.  Mr. Speaker, we must not allow our  country to continue to fall behind in  competitiveness.

482,9,2011-03-11,Mr. BACHUS.," Madam Chair, I yield  myself the balance of my time.  The American people have sent us  here to tell the truth, and the truth is  that there are too many government  programs that do not work and actually make things worse. These government programs are paid  for by the  American people.  You can say that it’s not from the  Treasury, or that it’s from the Treasury; that it’s from TARP, it’s not from  TARP. But the fact remains that it is  from the American taxpayer. In fact,  the gentleman at one  time  said  it  comes out of the Treasury. Then he  said  it comes  from TARP. But the  promise in 2008 was that it would go  back to the American people. It would  go back in the national Treasury. In  fact, it does not. I will address where it  goes, and I think the American people,  when they find out where it goes under  this program, they’re going to be even  more upset. I don’t think they’ll be  surprised, because I think they’ve come  to realize that there’s not a lot of will  in Washington to protect them, the  taxpayers.  The American people already know  that there are too many  ineffective  government programs  that cost  too  much, and this is a poster child for  those programs. If you can’t cut this  program, I’m not sure you can cut any.  And when we find such programs, we as  the representatives of the people have  a duty and a responsibility to the taxpayers to end these programs. That’s  what we are doing this morning. We’re  going to end this program. That’s what  we’re here for.  In this legislation by the gentleman  from Texas, we stop a $1 billion failed  spending program. Now it’s a well-intentioned program. But  just as  the  road to hell is paved with good intentions, so is the road to higher deficits  and record-breaking debt, a debt that  our children and our grandchildren will  have to pay.  You know, when we talk about the  taxpayers ultimately  fund  this program, when we borrow at 42 cents out  of every dollar, it’s our children and  our grandchildren that will have to pay  for  these  programs. We’re  charging  something and we’re telling them to  pay the bill.  Today, we have an unthinkable debt  of $14 trillion, a debt that imposes a  birth tax on every child born in America. It’s $45,000 today. Just last year it  was $35,000. It’s grown by $10,000. Even  worse, this debt or birth tax is growing  every day, because our government is  spending some days $5 billion, some  days $8 billion more than it takes in  and adding to what our children and  grandchildren will have to pay.  One question that the American people often confront is, are they better  off than their parents and will their  children be better off than they are,  and  their  grandchildren?  It’s  interesting that in survey after survey, or  poll after poll, the American people  say, we’re better off than our parents.  Our parents  fought  for our  freedom,  they preserved it in numerous wars,  they saved their money, they watched  their money, they worked hard, and  they left us in good shape.  But when that same question is a little different question, ‘‘Do you think  your children or grandchildren will be  better off?’’ the American people know.  They instinctively know. ‘‘No’’ is the  answer, sadly. And that’s because of  our national debt and our deficit. In  fact, both the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff and Secretary Robert  Gates have said that it’s a national security problem. Our debt threatens our  very existence as a country.  This Washington spending binge  is  driving our country right off a cliff.  We’ve seen the effect of overspending  on our economy today. The government absorbs so much money from our  citizens that it’s hard to create private  jobs. Each dollar out of the economy is  a job that the private sector can’t create.  Now actually President Reagan and  President Clinton both  realized  this  and  they grew  the economy. Those  were the only two years with a growing  economy and government spending either level or going down.

485,16,2011-03-11,Mr. WOMACK.," Madam Chair, hundreds of times since I took the oath of  office just a few weeks ago, I’ve heard  references to  ‘‘kicking the can down  the road.’’  This kicking of the can, the ‘‘can’’  being the deficit and the debt, has  come to the end of that road. In fact,  we have used this term so many times,  America has a chronic case of turf toe.  Washington is in a state of denial. We  continue to give away taxpayer dollars—correction, borrowed dollars—to  people who can’t afford to pay it back.  Our friends from the other side want  you to believe that we don’t have a  heart, that we’re  insensitive to the  plight of those who are struggling because they’ve lost jobs and can’t afford  their mortgages.  Well, let me tell you what Americans  understand.  Americans  understand  that we cannot continue to live in this  irresponsible way—giving  away  borrowed money, program after program,  knowing that  it’s going down a rat  hole. Just another kick at the proverbial can. If you can’t cut an expensive,  irresponsible program  like  this one,  then what can you cut?  Look, we’re all about job creation.  Job creation is the preferred way to deliver us from this financial plight that  we happen to be in. But the problem  with  job creation right now  is that  there is a dark, dark cloud hanging  over America as we know it with a  huge deficit, a record deficit, and a  mounting debt, a debt so large that  very soon in this very Chamber we’ll be  taking up the issue of a debt ceiling increase.  That  dark  cloud  includes  higher  taxes, that dark cloud includes burdensome regulation, and that dark cloud  certainly includes deficits and debt.  This program must be eliminated.  The savings must go to deficit reduction.  We have come to the end of the road.  We can no longer kick this can any further. My colleagues and I are demonstrating  leadership  in  this arena,  something this Congress has lacked for  several years.  I encourage support of H.R. 836.  ",2011

504,44,2011-03-11,Mr. BROUN of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, today,  I  introduced  the Removing Excess Litigation  Involving Energy on Federal Lands Act, RELIEF Act. This legislation would help streamline judicial procedures for causes and claims  regarding the leasing of Federal lands for the  exploration,  development,  production,  processing, or transmission of oil, natural gas, or  any other source or form of energy.  Excessive  legal  challenges  have  significantly delayed and in many cases prevented  energy resources from reaching the American  public. These oftentimes frivolous legal challenges have helped contribute to our nation’s  economic  turmoil  and  skyrocketing  energy  costs.  The RELIEF Act would not take away anyone’s  ‘‘day  in court;’’  instead,  it will simply  streamline the process for all parties involved.  This legislation would require that all claims be  filed within 60 days of an action or decision  and  that any proceeding be resolved within  180 days of the claim being filed and gives  precedence over other court proceedings. In  addition, it requires that all appeals from the  District Court be  reviewed by  the Supreme  Court and  that any proceeding be  resolved  within 180 days of the claim being filed. To  deter  frivolous  lawsuits,  it also requires  that  any person seeking judicial review of any action under this Act shall pay the prevailing party’s legal fees and other expenses, unless the  Court finds that the position of the person was  substantially  justified  or  that  special  circumstances make an award unjust.  As  the economic downturn continues and  energy prices soar, our nation must do everything in its power to access the abundant natural  resources with which we have been  blessed. I believe this legislation can play an  important part in our nation’s economic recovery by alleviating current energy costs, while  also helping to ensure our energy future.  f  HONORING THOMAS PATRICK  O’ROURKE  HON.

Born  on  February  22,  1936,  Thomas  O’Rourke was the younest of six children born  to James and Mary O’Rourke and attended  both Detroit Catholic Central and St. Cecelia  before graduating  from St. Cecelia  in 1954.  Having honorably served this great nation as  a member of the United States Army, SPC 4  Thomas O’Rourke was honorably discharged  on September 30, 1962. Thomas married the  love of his life, Mary Ellen on May 3, 1974. A  dedicated and loving father to their four children, Thomas embodied the truest spirit of the  Irish enjoying the boundless conversation and  camaraderie the Gaelic League and the Ancient Order of Hibernians. He was affectionately known as ‘‘Mr. Notre Dame’’ among his  friends at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post  where he was an active member.  On March  7,  2011,  Thomas O’Rourke  passed from this earthly world to his eternal  reward. Thomas will be deeply missed by his  wife of 36 years, Mary Ellen. He will long be  remembered as a  father devoted  to his beloved children Katie, Molly, Tom and Erin.  Thomas O’Rourke  leaves a  legacy  in his  grandchildren,  Ella,  Aidan,  Jack, Megan,  Danny, Colleen, Maggie and  the  impending  James, due in July. He is survived by his sister, Marge. Preceded into eternity by his parents, James and Mary as well as his brother  James and his sisters Marie, Dorothy and  Jane, Thomas was a wonderful man, kind to  all he encountered. He will be truly and sorrowfully missed.  Mr. Speaker, during his  lifetime, Thomas  O’Rourke  enriched  the  lives  of  everyone  around him. There is no doubt that Thomas  was a beacon of joy, hope and inspiration to  those who knew him. As we bid farewell to  this exceptional man, I ask my colleagues to  join me in mourning his passing and honoring  his life and his service to our community and  our country.  f  STATEMENT  ON  H.R.  998,  THE  ‘‘STUDENT NON-DISCRIMINATION  ACT’’  HON.

I  commend Congressman POLIS for  his  commitment to creating and fostering a safe  educational environment for all students. The  legislation we introduced today would assure  equal protection for lesbian, gay, bisexual, or  transgender, LGBT, students.  As an educator for over 30 years, I have  witnessed  firsthand  the devastating  impact  bullying  and  harassment  has  on  students  emotionally, socially and academically. These  problems are pervasive and persistent in our  schools. The hostile environment created by  harassment and bullying not only deprives students of the opportunity to receive a quality  education, but also contributes  to academic  underachievement. Furthermore, bullying and  harassment can, and have, led to life-threatening violence and suicide, as evidenced by  several nationally reported incidents including  cases in New Jersey, Philadelphia, New York  and across the United States.  Existing federal civil rights statutes that address discrimination do not cover sexual orientation or gender  identity,  thus LGBT students are vulnerable to discrimination, harassment, and bullying. Furthermore, there is no  recourse or legal protection when the rights of  LGBT students are violated.  The Student Non-Discrimination Act  is a  positive step toward achieving equal protection  for LGBT students. It will do this by prohibiting  discrimination in public school based on actual  or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. These steps will provide LGBT students a  safe environment  free  from discrimination  to  learn and succeed in school.  The SNDA has goals similar to legislation I  supported as chair of the Congressional Asian  Pacific American Caucus  including  the Safe  Schools  Improvement  Act,  which  helps  schools and school districts develop and improve anti-bullying and anti-harassment initiatives. We need all of this and much more, until  our students are safe enough to study without  the strain of discrimination or fear of bullying  and harassment.  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Student  Non-Discrimination Act  and  urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation to ensure that all our students have  access to a quality education free from fear.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

Mr. Speaker, as Roosevelt Dam embarks on  its second century of service, it deserves special recognition for its engineering marvel and  being an economic engine for central Arizona.  f  HONORING SPECIALIST DAVID R.  FAHEY  f  THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION  OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT DAM  HON. PAUL A. GOSAR  OFARIZONA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, March 11, 2011  ",2011
509,51,2011-03-11,Mr. GOSAR.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to Theodore Roosevelt Dam, an  engineering marvel that is celebrating its centennial of service to the people of Arizona, including a majority of constituents in my own  District.  When Federal engineers built Roosevelt  Dam on the Salt River in the beginning of the  20th Century, they did not have the conveniences of a nearby  town, an existing power  supply or a locally skilled labor force. Several  engineering feats needed to be accomplished  even before construction could begin at  the  site 80 miles east of Phoenix.  A road was cut into the sides of mountains  so supplies could be hauled from the Phoenix  area  to  the  dam  site. Members  of  local  Apache tribes helped build the road, and they  continued with the construction effort for the  dam. Federal engineers also constructed a 20-  mile canal to develop hydroelectric power at  the dam to power a cement mill, aerial trams  and cableways, and other equipment.  Stone masons cut massive blocks from the  sides of  the canyon. Cranes were used  to  lower the stones, some weighing as much as  10 tons, to the riverbed. They were laid in a  stair-step fashion, which gave the dam a distinctive appearance.  Federal engineers ensured the strength of  the dam by requiring the mortar joints on the  upstream face not to exceed 1 inch in width.  Following  the  laying of  the cornerstone  in  1906,  crews worked  nearly  nonstop, with  strings of electric lights suspended above the  site allowing men to work through the night.  Five years later, Roosevelt Dam had risen 280  feet high, with a base 184 feet thick that narrowed to 16 feet at the top. On the day of its  dedication on March 18, 1911, it was the largest  rubble-masonry  thick-arch  dam  in  the  world.  Due to its engineering and construction excellence, Roosevelt Dam  stood nearly unchanged for more than 80 years. In the 1990s,  a new generation of engineers needed to address dam safety,  regulatory water storage  and  flood control  in central Arizona. During  this construction effort, the entire face of the  dam was overlain with concrete,  ranging  in  thickness from 10 to 50 feet. The concrete extended upward to create a new crest and spillways were constructed deeper and narrower,  allowing  for greater water  releases during  floods. Renovations used nearly 450,000 cubic  yards of cement, enough to pave a two-lane  road between Phoenix and Tucson. The additional 77 feet of height effectively doubled the  capacity of the reservoir, enhancing its role in  managing water  supplies  for  the  growing  greater Phoenix metropolitan area.  HON.

Fahey, who lost  his life on Monday, February 28, 2011, while  courageously serving our nation  in Afghanistan. He was killed by an IED explosion. Yesterday he was laid to rest.  Specialist Fahey enlisted at the age of 20,  in August, 2007. He was deployed to Afghanistan in June, 2010. He is mourned by family,  friends, and  fellow  soldiers  from Yorktown  Heights, New York,  to Washington State,  Korea, and Afghanistan. He has been honored  for his service with the Combat Action Badge,  the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star.  Specialist Fahey’s dedication  to protecting  his fellow citizens extended to his plans to join  the New York City Police Department after the  completion of his tour of duty. His sacrifice for  our nation will be  remembered  through  the  family he loved and freedom he protected. I  ask the House to keep in their thoughts and  prayers Specialist Fahey and all  the other  brave men and women in our armed services  who have lost their lives, as well as those who  continue to serve abroad.  f  PAYING  TRIBUTE  TO  CAPTAIN  THOMAS F.

512,2,2011-03-29,Mr. YARMUTH.," Mr. Speaker, in Louisville, we have a lot to be proud of—  the Kentucky Derby,  the Louisville  Slugger, Muhammad Ali—and now the  NCAA Division  II Men’s Basketball  Champion Bellarmine Knights.  Led by Coach Scott Davenport, the  Knights finished their regular season  with 24 wins, won their second consecutive  conference  title,  and  stormed  through  the NCAA  tournament  to  bring home the university’s first national championship. The Knights corralled Mustangs and tamed Mavericks.  And on Saturday, led by all-tourney  players  Jeremy Kendle  and  Justin  Benedetti, Chris Dowe’s 16 points, Luke  Sprague’s  double-double,  and  clutch  free throws from Hobbs and Holmes,  the Knights grounded a Jet and sent  the Seasiders packing. The Knights are  true student athletes who overcame injuries and adversity bound together by  trust—trust in their abilities and trust  in each other. And let’s not forget the  trust and support of the fans who traveled by the busload nearly 900 miles to  cheer on their Knights.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me  today  in congratulating Coach Davenport,  the  team,  and  the  entire  Bellarmine  community  on  its  2011  NCAA national championship. This was  a victory that made history—and on  behalf of everyone in Louisville, we’re  proud to call the Knights our hometown heroes and national champions.  f  MR. PRESIDENT, AMERICA NEEDS  ANSWERS  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2011
513,2,2011-03-29,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker,  last  night, the President took to the airwaves and talked to the Nation about  the international efforts that America  is leading in Libya. This comes almost  2 weeks after the President gave his approval for the United States to be involved  in the action  in Libya. The  President discussed the United States’  interest in the conflict, the limited involvement of the United States military, and the role of other countries.  What the President  failed to deliver  was a clear articulation on what  is  America’s role in this conflict. Putting  our men and women  in harm’s way  while not knowing the specifics of how  and why is not just unacceptable, it is  dangerous.  Mr. President, you need to be more  forthcoming.  The  American  people  need more information. The American  people certainly deserve answers. The  explanation  last  night  was  disappointing, and we find ourselves even  more frustrated as specific information  was not provided. What  is the exit  strategy? What is the endgame? What  are our goals? How are we going to ensure that the next government of Libya  is not even more hostile than the current regime?  The President does need to  follow  through with his actions. We need to  have the resolve to see this through.  The President waited too long to address the Nation. Certainly, the Congress needed to be involved. And certainly the American people needed to  be involved.  f  b1410  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2011

520,9,2011-03-29,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," I yield  5 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. MILLER).  Mr. MILLER of North Carolina. Mr.  Chairman, I rise to oppose this bill, but  I do so with mixed feelings because I  have been one of the critics of the  HAMP program.  The members of the majority have  pointed out correctly that this program has been widely criticized  for  more than 2 years. It has been criticized by the congressional oversight  panel, by the SIGTARP  (Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset  Relief Program), by La Raza, by Elizabeth Warren, and, yes, by me. But I  have not criticized it for the reasons  that  the  gentleman  from Alabama  gave. If this bill is keeping a promise,  it is not a promise made in open to the  American people, it is keeping a promise made in secret to the banks, because the costs of this program are not  going to come out of the pockets of the  American people. This comes out of the  TARP program. That legislation said  that any money not recovered by 2013  has to be recovered from the financial  industry, and whoever’s present in 2013  has to propose to Congress exactly how  it is we’re going to get that money  back.  They can afford it. Thirty percent of  all corporate profits are in the financial sector. They can more than afford  it.  The gentleman  from Alabama  frequently  says  that he hates visiting  debt on his grandchildren, and I believe  him when he says it, but I have good  news for him. Unless his grandchildren  take a job on Wall Street in the next 2  years, they are not going to have to  pay this debt. This debt, if Congress  does keep its promise to the American  people, will not come from the American people. It will come  from Wall  Street. It will come from the people  who created the mess that we are now  trying to clean up.  But I have criticized this program because it is not as effective as it should  be. It has gone on for 2 years. It is not  what we need. The problem, however,  has not been what government has  made banks do. This program has been  run by the banks. It has not been run  by the government. It has been run by  the banks. Every horror story about a  homeowner’s  being  abused  is  being  abused by a bank, the bank handling  the mortgage, not by the Department  of the Treasury, not by the Federal  Government.  So, of course, when they come to see  a Republican Member of Congress, the  Republican Member of Congress says,  ‘‘Oh, isn’t it terrible what the Federal  Government made that poor bank do to  you.’’ No,  the Federal Government  didn’t make the banks do that.  My criticism of this program and my  criticism of the Obama administration  in how they have run this program is  not that they’ve made banks do what  they’ve done, but they have let banks  do what they’ve done. This program  can work if there are some tough rules  that are really enforced, tough on the  banks.  The gentleman from Massachusetts  mentioned earlier the bankruptcy proposal 3 years ago. I introduced that  bill. I have been trying to put rules, requirements, on the banks that they let  people out, that they try to begin to  let people out in a very orderly, logical, fair way, through judges, through  a judicial process, to begin to get control of the collapse of the housing market.  Something has got to happen to stop  the continuing fall of housing values.  Something has got to happen to end  the cycle of  foreclosures and diminished home  values  and more  foreclosures.  Republicans  have  offered  nothing to do that. We know something can work. We know that we can  design a program that will work, because it has been done before.  In the New Deal, one of the most successful programs in the New Deal was  the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation  which  bought mortgages, modified  them, worked with homeowners, tailored the mortgages to something the  homeowner could buy for those homeowners who really could afford a house,  the house that they were in but not the  mortgage that they had, and most historians say that program saved the  housing market in the Great Depression and saved the middle class.  We have got  to make  something  work. There are rules on the horizon.  There is now a pending settlement negotiation for the violations of law by  the banks  in how  they’ve managed  mortgages. It is with States attorneys  general and it is with the Federal regulatory agencies. Some on the Republican side have publicly pressured the  Federal agencies to lay off the banks. I  really cannot tell much difference between what they are doing in the pressure they are putting on banks and the  regulatory agents  in an enforcement  matter and what happened a generation ago with the Keating Five. But  they’re doing it. They’re saying, ‘‘Lay  off our buddies the banks. Don’t come  down too hard on them.’’ But there is a  real possibility the result of that settlement will be some tough rules, and  there  is now rule-making authority.  There is now a cop on the block. The  CFPB has  the authority  to develop  rules for banks in how they manage  mortgages.  But something has to work. This has  not been working. It can be fixed. It  has to be fixed. Something has to work.  ",2011

522,9,2011-03-29,Mr. MCHENRY.," I thank my colleague  for yielding, and responding to my colleague from North Carolina, Mr. Chairman, I would say that we agree: The  HAMP program is a failure. I think  there is bipartisan agreement on that.  Even  the SIGTARP, Mr. Barofsky,  says, ‘‘The Treasury Department is so  content with the wretched, shameful  status quo, they refuse to even acknowledge the program is a failure.’’  We agree. It’s a failure. Although it  sounds like, at the end of the day, he is  going to vote to defend a failed program.  Secondly, I would remind my colleague  that  this  program  actually  writes checks to those evil banks that  he talks about, with those evil profits  that he talks about, to the tune of  about a billion dollars. So this program  is actually cutting checks to banks.  Third and finally, that TARP money  is actually the taxpayer, the American  people’s money, not the banks’ money,  and we owe it to the American people  to give them back that money.  ",2011

530,23,2011-03-29,Mr. MCHENRY.," Mr. Chairman, I am  not sure what my colleague from Texas  has heard at her town hall meetings,  but what I have heard from my constituents, I have one resident of Stanley, North Carolina, who  said,  ‘‘We  have  paid  payments  every month.’’  Now, I say to my colleague, I have read  this before, but I wasn’t sure if you  were on the floor for this. But one constituent of mine said, ‘‘We have paid  payments every month. But now we are  being told we are behind in our payments because it is not the original  monthly payment on our original loan,  but it was an amount we were told to  pay in 2010. How can we be behind?’’  I would ask my colleagues to read  the Special Inspector General’s report,  ‘‘The Details of Failures of HAMP.’’ I  ask my colleagues to listen to their  constituents. More people in America, I  would remind my colleagues, more people in America, close to 800,000 Americans, have been actively harmed and  left worse off under this Federal program than have actually been helped.  My colleague points to a  laudable  survey of  the positives. The  survey  doesn’t detail the destroyed lives that  this HAMP program has pushed on people, has created.  So, this amendment, the reason why  I rise  in opposition  is because this  amendment is similar to ones we have  had in committee that we rejected in  committee. This directs the Treasury  to conduct a study of HAMP and would  be completely counterproductive. The  reason why  it would be completely  counterproductive  is over the  last 6  months we have seen the Treasury Department engage in a frantic 6-month  media campaign for this program. They  won’t admit it is a failure; although,  the rest of the world is largely saying  it is a failure. They even have offered a  veto threat on this legislation.  The Special Inspector General, Mr.  Barofsky, said just earlier this week,  ‘‘This Treasury Department is so content with the wretched, shameful status quo, they refuse to even acknowledge that the program is a failure.’’  And that is why simply to offer the  Treasury to study this really  is beneath the House.  b1630  I yield back the balance of my time.

533,23,2011-03-29,Ms. MATSUI.,"  I yield myself  time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an  amendment to H.R. 839, the HAMP Termination Act, that calls on mortgage  lenders to continue to publicly report  basic home loan modification information.  Because of an amendment I offered to  the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform  and Consumer Protection Act which  passed  the house unanimously  last  Congress, mortgage lenders and services participating in the Home Affordable Modification Program  are  required to report basic loan modification information to the Department of  the Treasury. Due to the enactment of  my amendment, we now know that 2.5  million Americans have applied to participate in the Home Affordable Modification Program, and well over 600,000  of those applicants began permanent  modifications.  In the Sacramento region, over 9,000  of the nearly 12,000 homeowners who  have applied for permanent modifications have been approved, providing assistance to thousands of homeowners  in my district. This information is crucial  to  accountability  and  transparency and for this Congress to measure the performance of the mortgage  industry.

543,30,2011-03-29,Mr. LARSEN  of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker,  this  amendment  does  one  simple thing:  It  continues  the Home Affordable  Modification Program for members of  the Armed Forces and Gold Star recipients.  Mr. Speaker, we all know the Home  Affordable Modification Program has  not performed to the original projections, but this is an effort that has provided 600,000 permanent loan modifications. Six hundred thousand American  families are still in their homes because of this effort. I doubt these families would tell you it is not working.  Mr. Speaker, some will say that terminating  this program won’t affect  those who have already received modifications or are working  through a  modification currently. Yet many more  families still need help, especially military and gold star families.  Even though the economy is beginning to recover, the housing market is  still  struggling. HAMP  is  currently  helping 30,000 additional families every  month.  I would prefer that we keep this effort going for everyone. But if we are  not about to, at a minimum we need to  preserve this program for active military and gold star families.  Regardless of how anyone feels about  the underlying legislation and regardless of how anybody feels about the  funding for the original legislation, we  can all agree that we owe our men and  women in uniform a tremendous debt  of gratitude for their service and sacrifice. While defending our country,  servicemembers should not be afraid  that their families will lose the roof  over their heads, but that’s the very  situation in which a Navy sailor found  himself last year as part of Operation  Enduring Freedom.  Seven  thousand miles  from home,  there was little he could do to help his  spouse balance the stress of raising two  children, of her work, and of household  expenses. To top it off, their mortgage  was about to jump to almost $2,300 a  month. But this family was able to find  relief in the Home Affordable Modification Program.

Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 493,  the small business jobs bill. The Senate  will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow  for weekly caucus meetings. Rollcall  votes in relation to amendments to the  small business  jobs bill are possible  today. Senators will be notified when  votes are scheduled.  We have 10 amendments now pending.  I spoke yesterday afternoon to the Republican leader, and I think we are in  good shape now to hopefully resolve  the 1099 matter this afternoon. We are  looking forward to having a consent  agreement we can vote on. I think we  are at a point where, in the morning,  we can vote on the McConnell amendment dealing with EPA and a couple  other amendments relating to EPA to  get rid of that issue one way or the  other.  There are other matters with the bill  we would like to set up votes on, and if  people are willing to allow us to do  that, we could do some of those this  afternoon. But we are making progress  on this very important bill. With all  the  amendments  being  offered, we  sometimes lose sight of the fact that  this bill, which has been led by Senators LANDRIEU and SNOWE, is an extremely  important bill  for  creating  jobs with small businesses. It is an innovation bill, and the programs this  bill covers have done some tremendously important things for the country.  With the CR, I spoke with the White  House this morning, and there are conversations going on with the White  House and the Republican leadership in  the House, and I think this matter,  with a little bit of good fortune, could  move down the road in the next day or  two to get us to a point where we could  have something done so there doesn’t  have to be a government shutdown.

Yet in the middle of all this, it is important we not lose sight of the struggles and concerns of so many around us  here at home.

550,58,2011-03-29,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Let me try to recap  for just a moment because it is my understanding there may be some colleagues coming down to the Senate  floor around 12 o’clock to pay tribute  to an extraordinary woman and extraordinary American, Geraldine Ferraro, whom we lost this week. I most  certainly want to be respectful to the  Members who are coming to the floor  to pay tribute to our former colleague  and an extraordinary leader. But let  me remind colleagues we are still trying to get to this bill, an important bill  for the country, an important bill to  help put this recession in our rearview  mirror, an important bill that gives us  yet one more very carefully crafted  tool to help create jobs on Main Street,  in rural areas, in suburban areas, and  in urban areas all across this country;  that is, the 8-year reauthorization of  the Small Business Innovation and Research Program and Small Business  Technology Transfer Program.  This program  is approximately  20  years old, first passed by Senator Warren Rudman, when a report found its  way to Congress that said, alarmingly,  agencies of the Federal Government,  whether it was the Department of Defense or NASA or NIH, were not accessing the power and the technology of  the small business community; that  when they went out to do research they  were just looking at research offered  by either just universities and we are  very proud of the work that our universities do, but they were  looking at  large businesses. What did GE have to  offer? What did IBM have to offer?  It occurred to many Members of Congress at that time that there was a tremendous amount of brain power and  agility and quickness and cutting-edge,  innovative technologies resting in the  minds and hearts and dreams of entrepreneurs and small businesses in America the taxpayers were not benefiting  from.  As you can  imagine, people might  think of all this technology coming out  of New York or California. They might  skip over a place such as Montana  where the Presiding Officer is from or  Louisiana where this Senator is from.  So there were some very wise Members  who said: Let’s create a program that  will direct at least a portion of the research  and  development  funding  of  so  small busithese  large agencies  nesses can compete.  Now, these are grants not given out  by  formula or on a  first-come/first-  served basis. These grants and contracts are given out based on merit,  about what looks promising, about potential, and about what the taxpayers  need in terms of dealing with problems.  One thing that comes immediately to  mind is the terrible tragedy unfolding  in Japan as we speak with the potential meltdown, the process of a nuclear  reactor melting down. Some of  the  technology being deployed to that situation, which is technology developed in  the field of robotics, was developed, a  portion of it, through this SBIR Program. So that makes very relevant the  debate that we are having on the floor  today.  When people go home and now are  turning on their televisions or listening to their radios or over the Internet  following those unfolding dramatic developments in Japan, they know that  one of the companies that has been deployed and some of the material from  the United States actually was developed through this program. So that is  just one of a thousand examples that  Senator SNOWEand I have provided in  terms of testimony before the Small  Business Committee to the CONGRESSIONALRECORD, and in our numerous  speeches on the floor to talk about the  importance of this program.  I would like, as the manager of this  bill—I am not sure it is going to be possible, but I would most certainly like  to have this bill voted on and passed by  the end of this week. I am not sure the  leadership has decided that is something that is possible. But I would like  to  send a  strong bill over  to  the  House—hopefully, a bill that does not  have amendments on  it  that would  warrant a Presidential  threat of a  veto—and get this bill passed through  the House and then passed on to the  President so he can sign it and send a  very positive signal for his agenda and  all of our agendas for innovation—having America be the best educated, the  best competitors in the world in terms  of the economy, and giving our small  businesses yet another tool.  We have worked on  reducing  the  abuses in the credit card industry. We  have worked on capital access through  a new lending program. We have reduced fees, reduced taxes to the tune of  $12  billion  to  our  small  businesses  throughout  the country  in  the  last  Congress. We want to continue to work  on lowering taxes where we can, eliminating regulations and supporting programs like this that work.  Let’s eliminate or modify those programs that are not working, and let’s  step up our support and reauthorize the  programs that are. The assessments  done and the reviews of this program  by the  independent researchers have  been very positive across the board and  outstanding.  Senator SNOWEand I have taken into  consideration those many reports  in  the drafting of this bill and made some  changes to the program so that as it  moves forward for the 8 years it will  even be better.  One of my key goals and objectives is  to make sure States such as Louisiana  or Mississippi or Montana or Wyoming,  States that have not previously been  awarded many of these grants, know  we have stepped up some technical assistance and help so we can find the  best  technology  in  this  country  to  apply to some of our most pressing  problems, regardless of whether they  are in the big cities and big places such  as New York, Los Angeles, CA. But we  need  our  entrepreneurs  around  the  country to benefit by a program that  they have access to as well.  So I am pleased that we can get back  on the small business innovation and  research bill and small business technology  transfer bill. Senator SNOWE  and I will be coming to the floor periodically during the day to continue to  move this bill along.  I see my colleague, the Senator from  Maryland, who is scheduled to speak in  just a few minutes. So at this time I  will yield the floor. Again, I hope, and  I thank our colleagues for their cooperative nature that they have been working in in terms of trying to get our bill  passed that will be so important to so  many people in all of our States.  I yield the floor.  ",2011

I thank the leadership for offering  the resolution noting the many contributions she made to America and to  express condolences to her family.  For we women, before 1960, Gerry was  a force of nature, a powerhouse. She  changed  American  politics.  She  changed the way women thought of  themselves and what we believed we  could accomplish.  On July 11, 1984, when Walter Mondale called Gerry Ferraro and asked  her to be his Vice Presidential running  mate,  an  amazing  thing  happened.

560,65,2011-03-29,Mr. MCCAIN.," I would like to take  time today to address the ongoing situation in Libya. Last night, the President made a strong defense of our military action in Libya. I welcome his remarks, and I appreciate that he explained why this intervention was both  right and necessary, especially in light  of the unprecedented democratic awakening that is now sweeping the broader  Middle East.  There has been much criticism of the  President’s handling of the situation in  Libya—some legitimate, some not. But  the  fact  is, because we did act, the  United States and our coalition partners averted a strategic and humanitarian disaster in Libya.  Even as we seek adjustments to U.S.  policy where  appropriate  to  ensure  that we accomplish the U.S. goal as  stated by the President of forcing Qadhafi  to  leave power,  I believe  the  President’s decision  to  intervene  in  Libya deserves strong bipartisan support in Congress and among all Americans.  It is worth remembering, especially  for the critics of this intervention, exactly what we would be facing in Libya  now had we not taken action. Just over  1 week ago, Qadhafi was bearing down  on Benghazi, a city of 700,000 people,  and the main seat of the Libyan opposition, as well as the provisional government that has now emerged.  Qadhafi pledged  in his words: No  mercy for these people. He pledged to  go house to house, to crush everyone  opposed to him. Had we not taken action in Libya, Benghazi would now be  remembered  in  the  same breath as  Srebrenica, a scene of mass slaughter  and a source of international shame.  Libyan  refugees  would  now  be  streaming into Egypt and Tunisia destabilizing those critical countries during  their already daunting political  transitions. If we had allowed Qadhafi  to  slaughter Arabs and Muslims  in  Benghazi who were pleading  for the  U.S. military to rescue them, America’s moral standing  in the broader  Middle East would have  been  devastated. Al-Qaida and other violent extremists would have exploited the resulting chaos and hopelessness. The  forces of counterrevolution in the region would have gotten the message  that the world would tolerate the violent oppression of peaceful demonstrations for universal rights. This would  have been a dramatic setback for the  Arab spring which represents the most  consequential geopolitical opportunity  in centuries.  That is why Libya matters and why  we were right to intervene. Yes, there  are many other places  in the world  where evil resides, where monsters brutalize civilians. The United States cannot and should not intervene in all of  these places. But we were right to do so  in Libya because of the unique position  this country now occupies at a moment  of historic change in the Middle East  and North Africa. This does not mean  we should take the same actions toward other countries in the region as  we have toward Libya.  Each of these countries is different.  Their challenges and situations are different. When governments, both friend  and foe, use force and oppression to  crush peaceful demands for universal  rights, we need to be clear in our condemnation, and we need to support the  aspirations  of  all  people who  seek  greater freedom, justice, and economic  opportunity.  But let’s be clear. Qadhafi’s brutal  and vicious slaughter of fellow Arabs  and Muslims has set Libya completely  apart from other countries in the region, and  it warranted  the decisive  military response we and our  international partners have taken. While  some believe the President should have  sought a congressional authorization  for the use of force, or even a formal  declaration of war prior to taking military action in Libya, I think his actions were in keeping both with the  constitutional powers of the President  and with past practices, be it President  Reagan’s action in Grenada or President Clinton’s action in the Balkans.  Had Congress taken even a few days  to debate the use of force prior to acting in Libya, there would have been  nothing left to save in Benghazi. That  is why our Founders gave the President  the power as Commander in Chief to respond swiftly and energetically to crises. What we need now is not a debate  about the past; that can come later.  Many of us who wanted a no-fly zone at  the time still are convinced that this  could have been over by now. But the  fact is, it is in the past.  What we need is a forward-looking  strategy to accomplish the U.S. goal—  as  articulated  by  the President—of  forcing Qadhafi  to  leave power. We  have prevented the worst outcome in  Libya, but we have not yet secured our  goal. As some of us predicted, U.S. and  coalition airpower has decisively and  quickly reversed the momentum of Qadhafi’s forces, but now we need to refine U.S. strategy to achieve success as  quickly as possible.  As every military strategist knows,  the  purpose  of  employing military  force is to achieve policy goals. Our  goal in Libya is that Qadhafi must go,  and it is the right goal. But let’s be  honest with ourselves: We are indeed  talking about regime change, whether  the President wants to call it that or  not. While I agree with the President  that we should not send U.S. ground  troops  to Libya  to  remove Qadhafi  from power, that is exactly what Libyan opposition forces are fighting to do.  They are now on the outskirts of Qadhafi’s hometown of Surt, and they appear to have no intention of stopping  there.  Thus far, U.S. and coalition airpower  has cleared a path for the opposition to  advance. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 authorizes the use of ‘‘all necessary measures’’ to protect civilians  in Libya. As long as Qadhafi remains in  power, he will pose an increasing danger to the world, and civilians in Libya  will not be safe.  Ultimately, we need to be straight  with the American people and with  ourselves. We are not neutral in the  conflict in Libya. We want the opposition to succeed, and we want Qadhafi  to leave power. These are just causes.  And we must therefore provide the necessary and appropriate assistance to  aid the opposition in their fight. That  certainly means continuing to use air  power to degrade Qadhafi’s military  forces in the field, and I am encouraged  by the fact that we are now bringing in  AC–130 and A–10 attack aircraft to provide more close-in air support.

561,72,2011-03-29,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  f  REMEMBERING REID S. JONES  ",2011
562,72,2011-03-29,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  rise today to pay tribute to one of the  Commonwealth’s  finest, the  late Mr.  Reid S. Jones. A native of Pulaski  County, KY, Reid was a prime example  of a man who was a true American hero  and who valued his faith, his family,  and his community.  A rich tradition of business success  and pride in hard work and achievement  always  seemed  prevalent  throughout the history of Reid’s family, so it came as no surprise when Reid  began to exhibit early signs of entrepreneurial instincts. As a young boy,  members of his hometown witnessed  Reid leading a small goat down a road  from the country store operated by his  parents to a local family farm as he  tried to make a sale. It was this ambition and drive that made Reid S. Jones  a leader, a war hero, and a guiding  force for all who knew him.  Reid, who passed away on April 15,  2005, joined the U.S. Army in 1944 at a  crucial point during World War  II.  Eighteen years old, Reid felt a strong  desire to serve and protect his country  as well as to defend the rights and freedoms of others. He courageously fought  in the Battle of the Bulge, one of the  deadliest battle for American forces of  the war. Reid’s leadership got him promoted to the rank of staff sergeant,  and he remained  in Germany  for a  short time after the war to help begin  the reconstruction process.  After returning home from the war  to his new bride Elva Sears, Reid received a bachelor’s degree from Union  College in Barbourville, KY. He decided  to  further  his  dedication  for  educational excellence and became a history teacher, principal, and basketball  coach for the Pulaski County and Somerset City school systems. His firm yet  compassionate  character made Reid  well-respected by his peers and fondly  remembered by his  former students.  Later in the 1960s he became a district  sales manager for the Fram Corporation, an automotive product brand best  known for their oil filters. His eye for  detail  and  strong  ambition  to  get  things done earned him frequent recognition for exceeding sales quotas and  helped him play an instrumental role  in placing Fram products in Wal-Marts  across the southeastern United States.  Reid’s  ‘‘jack of all trades’’ ability  eventually  led him to open his own  automotive businesses, as well as become a 32nd-degree Mason, a member  of the Oleika Shriners Temple, and the  board of directors of the First United  Methodist Church.  In addition to serving his community  through  business  and  educational  work, Reid deeply cherished the relationships he had with his friends and  family. He has often been remembered  through  the  strong  friendships  he  formed with members of the Somerset  community,  as  he met  daily with  friends at his automotive businesses  for coffee and southern storytelling.  His dedication to public service and  education, led his wife, along with his  daughter, Dr. Sonya Jones, to establish  The Jones Educational Foundation, to  provide scholarships and assistance for  people of south-central Kentucky and  beyond who seek greater education and  who show effort and ability.  There is no doubt that because of  Reid’s character, his dedication to family and friends, and his contributions  to higher education and the business  community, that his town, the Commonwealth, and the country have been  forever changed for the better.  The Commonwealth Journal recently  published an article about Mr. Reid S.  Jones  and  a  contribution  that his  daughter made  to  the  Jones Educational Foundation on behalf of his  dear friend, the late James Eastham. I  ask unanimous consent that the full  article be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Commonwealth Journal, Jan. 30,  2011]  FOUNDATIONLAUNCHESREIDS. JONESMEMORIALFUNDWITHCONTRIBUTIONHONORING  JAMES‘ONION’ EASTHAM  The Jones Educational Foundation Inc., a  501(c)3 not-for-profit corporation based  in  Somerset, has launched the Reid S. Jones  Memorial Fund with a $1,000 contribution  made by Dr. Sonya Jones honoring the late  James Arthur ‘‘Onion’’ Eastham.  According to Dr. Jones, president and CEO  of The Jones Foundation, the donation is intended to pay tribute to the friendship between James ‘‘Onion’’ Eastham, a man who  was regarded highly in the Somerset community, and her father.  Further, the fund is meant to honor veterans from all the wars in which the United  States has fought. The initial donation honors veterans who served in the European and  Pacific theaters of World War II.  ‘‘I had been thinking about the Foundation  setting up a fund for veterans in Dad’s name  ever since I made a donation in his memory  to help restore the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial building at Union College,’’ Dr. Jones  said.  Reid Jones graduated from Union in 1989.  He went on to do graduate work in education  at Eastern Kentucky University.  ‘‘When Mr. Eastham passed away in late  December, I knew it was time,’’ Dr. Jones  added. ‘‘Dad thought so much of his friend  that I felt he would want me to do something  special to honor Onion’s memory.’’  Reid Sievers Jones (April 24, 1926 to April  15, 2005) entered the U.S. Army at a crucial  point in the history of World War II. He was  stationed in Germany, and he fought in the  Battle of the Bulge. He was a survivor in  what has been called ‘‘one of the bloodiest  battles’’ of World War II.  Conducted in the dense mountainous region of Belgium, the Battle of the Bulge was  Adolf Hitler’s last major offensive against  the Allies. The battle ran from Dec. 16, 1944,  until Jan. 25, 1945.  When he enlisted in the Army as a private,  Reid Jones was 18 years of age. He married  Elva Sears on Dec. 30, 1944, shortly before  shipping out to the European front. He was  promoted to the rank of staff sergeant and  remained in Germany for a short time after  the war to help begin the process of reconstruction.  James ‘‘Onion’’ Eastham (Sept. 22, 1923, to  Dec. 28, 2010) served in the Asiatic-Pacific  theater where he was awarded two bronze  stars for duty at and during the Luzon and  Southern Philippine campaigns. He also received the Philippine Liberation Ribbon with  a bronze star for duty involving combat with  the enemy.  Reid Jones and Onion Eastham were ‘‘two  of a kind,’’ said Jimmy Eastham, son of the  former Somerset City Council member who  served as  staff  sergeant and  crew  chief  aboard a B–25 bomber in the United States  Marine Corp.  Jones and Eastham both were salesmen  after the war. Jones worked for many years  for Fram Corp. and Eastham for the Morton  Salt Co. The two men liked to get together  and engage in the high art of Southern storytelling. Both formed strong friendships with  other men in the Somerset community.  ‘‘Dad and Onion Eastham were part of a  group of men who convened initially at Dad’s  car lot out on East Mt. Vernon Street, then  at Dad’s automotive parts store on Ogden  Street  in the building now owned by Dr.  Byron Owens,’’ Dr. Jones said.  ‘‘After Dad retired from Fram, he devoted  most of his time to the automotive business  and our family’s business and our family’s  rental properties,’’ Dr. Jones continued.  ‘‘When Dad closed one automotive parts  store housed  in  the  same building with  Mother’s antiques and collectibles, he and  his buddies met  for coffee at  the Sugar  Shack over on the strip,’’ she said.  Meeting for coffee was part of their ‘‘daily  routine,’’ said Jimmy Eastham.  From time to time, the group also included  Bobby Claunch, Howard Eastham, Ledger  Howard, Penny Starnes, Don Stone, Jim Williams and Bob Williams in addition to Reid  Jones and Onion Eastham.  Like his father, Jimmy Eastham served as  a member of Somerset City Council. He and  the Eastham family have given their enthusiastic endorsement to the Reid S. Memorial  Fund with Dr. Jones’ cornerstone contribution in memory of James ‘‘Onion’’ Eastham.  ‘‘It is a good idea to establish the fund  even if it weren’t done in the name of my father,’’ Eastham said.  Both Reid Jones and James Eastham were  ‘‘very  patriotic,’’  according  to Virginia  Eastham, mother of Jimmy, Lisa (Bandy)  and Wayne Eastham.  When Reid Jones returned from the war, he  worked first as a teacher and principal in the  Pulaski County and Somerset City school  systems. He is remembered, particularly by  former students at Shopville High School as  a firm teacher who was not afraid to exercise  discipline when he thought it was needed.  Later, in the 1960s, he joined Fram Corp.,  based in Providence, R.I., as a district sales  manager. Frequently, he was recognized for  exceeding sales quotas. He was instrumental  in  placing Fram  products  in Wal-Marts  across the southeastern United States.  Reid Jones was a 32nd degree Mason and a  member of Oleika Shriners Temple in Lexington. He served on the board of directors of  First United Methodist Church.  In addition to being an influential member  of Somerset City Council, James  ‘‘Onion’’  Eastham was a member of the Somerset Masonic Lodge #111 and a long-standing member of the Kiwanis Club. He was also a member of First Baptist Church where he taught  Sunday school and served as chair of a building committee for the church’s new sanctuary.

OF By Mr. BROWN of Ohio (for himself and Ms. SNOWE):  S. 665. A bill to promote  industry  growth and competitiveness and to improve worker training, retention, and  advancement, and for other purposes;  to  the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.  ",2011
564,79,2011-03-29,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President,  I rise  today in support of the Selecting Employment Clusters  to Organize Regional Success, SECTORS, Act, which  Senator SHERRODBROWNand I are introducing.  This  legislation  would  amend the Workforce Investment Act  of 1998 to establish an industry or sector partnership grant program administered by the Department of Labor.  The SECTORS Act provides grants to  industry  clusters—interrelated  group  of businesses, service providers, and associated institutions—in order to establish and expand sector partnerships.  By providing  financial assistance to  these  partnerships,  this  legislation  would  create  customized workforce  training solutions  for specific  industries at a regional level. A sector approach  is beneficial because  it  can  focus on the dual goals of promoting  the  long-term competitiveness of  industries  and  advancing  employment  opportunities for workers, thereby encouraging economic growth. Existing  sector partnerships have long been recognized as key strategic elements within some of the most successful economic  development  initiatives  throughout  the  country.  Unfortunately, current federal policy does not  provide  sufficient  support  for  these  critical ventures.  As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Senate  Task Force on Manufacturing, one of  my key goals is to ensure that manufacturers have access  to a  capable  workforce. Unfortunately, manufacturers across the country have raised significant concerns about whether the  next generation of workers  is being  trained to meet the needs of an increasingly high-tech workplace.  In fact, in my home State of Maine,  the manufacturing sector has shed an  alarming 26,200  jobs  in the past ten  years, or 1/3 of the State’s manufacturing employment. And since the beginning of 1990, our state has lost 43,000  jobs. It is therefore critical that we as  a Nation provide unemployed manufacturing workers the training needed to  excel as our manufacturing sector becomes increasingly technical. This legislation provides a crucial link between  establishing worker training programs  and fostering new employment opportunities for those who have been affected by the manufacturing industry’s  decline. By promoting this innovative  partnership, we will take a crucial step  toward rejuvenating our economy.  Throughout the country, sector partnerships are being used to promote the  long-term  competitiveness  of  industries and to advance employment opportunities. For example, the State of  Maine has created the North Star Alliance  Initiative.  The  Alliance  has  brought together Maine’s boat builders,  the University  of Maine’s Advanced Engineered Wood Composites  Centers, Maine’s marine and composite  trade association, economic development groups, and investment organizations  for  the purpose of advancing  workforce training.  Our Nation’s capacity to innovate is  a key reason why our economy, despite  difficult times, remains the envy of the  world. Ideas by innovative Americans  across the spectrums of professions and  industries have paid enormous dividends, improving the lives of millions  throughout the world. We must continue to encourage all avenues for advancing our nation’s economic well-  being if America is to compete at the  vanguard of innovation. The SECTORS  Act will help align America’s workforce with the needs of our Nation’s  employers to promote a robust and  growing economy.

571,93,2011-03-29,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor and  recognition of Parma Park Reformed Church, also known as the ‘‘Church in  the Woods,’’ which will be closing its doors following fifty years of ministry.  The congregation of Parma Park Reformed  Church began in 1960. They met in a local  grade school until the Church in the Woods  was constructed in 1962. Since then, the congregation has been deeply  involved  in  the  community. The church offered Bible studies,  Alcoholics Anonymous groups, and grief support groups. Community outreach projects included a meal program called  ‘‘Pay  it Forward’’ and a program in which the congregation’s children sent gifts and correspondence  to military units in Iraq and Afghanistan. The  Church in the Woods has also been a popular  location  for private,  intimate wedding ceremonies.  At the end of March, Parma Park Reform  Church will host  its  final service. The congregation  intends  to  continue  its  services  through other nearby churches.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me  in honoring Parma Park Reform Church.  Its  presence will be sorely missed; however,  I  have no doubt that its mission will live on.

572,93,2011-03-29,Mr. DANIEL E.," LUNGREN of California. Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor  an old friend, Oliver (Ollie) Speraw, who on  March 26, 2011 turned 90 years of age. Ollie  has lived a life full of notable accomplishments  where he became a captain of industry and a  humble public servant.  Ollie grew up in Long Beach after moving  there at a young age with his family from Minnesota. As a young man Ollie worked  in a  number of different trades and contributed to  the early war effort, riveting P–38s, before finally coming of age to enlist in the Army Air  Corps and serve during WW2. After returning  home he entered  the Real Estate Business,  starting Sparrow Reality, and became one of  the original pioneers of Century 21 Real Estate. Throughout his life, Ollie has been actively  involved  in his home  town of Long  Beach and  the surrounding  region, participating  in multiple organizations such as  the  Long Beach Jaycees, Oceanside Chamber of  Commerce  and  the Oceanside Rotary.  In  1954, he began his  first position  in civilian  public service as a member of the Long Beach  Water Board, and served  there until 1969.  Ollie was inspired by Ronald Reagan, California’s Governor at the time, and his message  of an efficient, cost-cutting government. He  subsequently volunteered for one of the Governor’s citizen committees. Out of this inspiration, Ollie became more active  in politics,  which led him to become a Board Member on  the 31st Senate District Republican Central  Committee, of which I was also a member at  the time. Ollie moved on to win his first election  in 1979, where he  joined  the California  State Senate and served  there until 1984.  While in the Senate he gained a reputation as  a protector of  the  taxpayer who sought  to  make government leaner, effective and more  efficient. Californians who have a  little  red  organ donor sticker on their Drivers Licenses  can be reminded daily of just a small piece of  his legislative legacy.  Ollie served his country with honor in World  War II, helped pioneer one of the largest employers  in  the Real Estate  industry and has  honorably served the people of California as  one of their elected officials. It has been my  pleasure to know Ollie Speraw and more importantly, to call him my friend. Please join me  in wishing him a happy 90th birthday.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF JAMES J.  GNEW  HON. DENNIS J.

Gnew, a praiseworthy  individual who has devoted his life to upholding  the  law and defending  the  lives and  wellbeing of the citizens of Cleveland.  James’ service to others began early in his  life. In 1966, James joined the Army to serve  his country in Vietnam. After leaving the Army,  he  joined  the Cleveland Police Department,  extending his service  to  the community at  large. He was noted for his superb talents as  an officer of the law and in 1978 he was chosen to be a part of a high risk tactical division  which would eventually become the Cleveland  SWAT team.  His  tenure as a valued member of  the  SWAT team is filled with numerous achievements. Throughout his career he conducted  over 400 high risk operations. One such incident occurred on January 4th, 1984. James  led his team in successfully defusing a hostage scenario at Cleveland’s Hopkins  International Airport. James handled the situation  exceptionally well. In recognition of his acts of  heroism, he received numerous awards including a Silver Star, 3 Medals of Heroism, a  Medal of Valor and the Ohio Tactical Officers  Association Lifetime Achievement award.  James is also a caring husband and father.  He loves his wife Cheryl dearly, and his three  children are always in James’ thoughts.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me  in honoring James J.

575,100,2011-03-29,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, according to recent figures calculated by my Texas  colleague JOHNCULBERSON, an  illegal  immigrant apprehended by Border Patrol agents  during the last fiscal year had an eight in ten  chance of never being prosecuted.  Specifically,  in Fiscal Year 2010, nearly  450,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended  by  the Border Patrol. Of  this amount, only  about 73,000 were prosecuted,  roughly 16  percent. This means that 84 percent of illegal  immigrants  taken  into  custody were never  prosecuted!  And while the Obama administration claims  the border is more secure than ever, a recent  Government Accountability Office report found  that efforts by Border Patrol  to stop  illegal  crossings were ‘‘poor.’’ In fact, it is estimated  that  there are  three successful  illegal crossings for every one thwarted. That means more  than a million illegal immigrants enter the U.S.  each year.  The border is never going to be secure until  we enforce all of our  immigration  laws and  turn off the jobs magnet that encourages illegal immigration. Allowing millions to evade our  laws is unfair and hurts American workers and  taxpayers.  RECOGNIZING MARCH AS  NATIONAL KIDNEY MONTH  HON. ADAM SMITH  OFWASHINGTON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  ",2011
576,100,2011-03-29,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to recognize March as National Kidney Month. This is an ideal time to renew the  commitment to take action to stop kidney disease.  National Kidney Month observes the significance of kidney health and allows us to educate each other on methods of prevention,  treatments, and potential cures for kidney disease. More  than 26 million Americans have  chronic kidney disease. Minority patients and  communities including Hispanic, African-American, and Native-American populations are at  an increased risk at developing the disease.  While the rate of those affected by kidney disease is increasing, many individuals with kidney ailments go undiagnosed. Most people  forego visiting a doctor until symptoms are severe and damages to the kidneys are irreparable. Kidney disease can be fatal to those  who do not identify the symptoms of kidney  failure. Every year, thousands die prematurely  of cardiovascular problems  linked  to kidney  disease where death could have been prevented in many cases.  In addition  to  the health effects of kidney  disease, kidney failure can also be costly. Currently, less than one percent of all Medicare  beneficiaries have some form of renal disease,  yet the disease consumes nearly seven percent of the annual Medicare budget.  Prevention is the best approach at dealing  with kidney disease. The most common risk  factors are high blood pressure and diabetes,  which can be controlled by diet, exercise, taking prescribed medication, and regular visits to  a health care professional. National Kidney  Month serves as an important reminder for individuals,  especially minorities  as well  as  those with hypertension and diabetes, to get  their kidneys checked regularly.  In my district, the non-profit Northwest Kidney Centers provides testing opportunities at  community  events  and  provides  important  education  to  the public about kidney health  and renal disease prevention.  Kidney disease  is common, harmful, but  treatable, especially  if caught  in  time. Let’s  continue to work to stop kidney disease, save  Medicare dollars, and save lives while doing it.  f  MALOREY BOPP  HON.

577,100,2011-03-29,Mr. PERLMUTTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize and applaud Malorey Bopp  for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service  Ambassadors for Youth award. Malorey Bopp  is an 8th grader at Arvada K–8 and received  this award because her determination and  hard work have allowed her to overcome adversities.  The dedication demonstrated by Malorey  Bopp is exemplary of the type of achievement  that can be attained with hard work and perseverance. It is essential students at all levels  strive to make the most of their education and  develop a work ethic which will guide them for  the rest of their lives.  I  extend my  deepest  congratulations  to  Malorey Bopp for winning the Arvada Wheat  Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.  I have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication and character in all her future accomplishments.  f  HONORING  FALLEN MIAMI-DADE  OFFICERS ROGER CASTILLO AND  AMANDA HAWORTH  HON.

578,5,2011-04-07,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I have no disagreement with the gentlelady from North Carolina in terms  of trying to eliminate waste, fraud and  abuse in government. I think we’re all  for a  leaner government. But what  we’re not for is a meaner government.  And that is what the Republican policies are all about—a meaner government.  There’s a story that I will submit to  the RECORDhere. It’s talking about the  Republican budget. It says the Budget  Office claims the GOP Medicare plan  could  lead  to  rationing, making  it  more difficult for our senior citizens to  get health care.  By basically obliterating Medicare,  you may save a few bucks in the short  term, but you’re going to deny them  care in the long term. I don’t see how  that is right.  Secondly, I didn’t talk about the past  in my opening statement; the gentlelady did. I just want the record to be  clear about the past and how we got  into this mess.  When Bill Clinton  left office, we  eliminated the deficit and we were paying down the debt. We had all-time  high job growth. George Bush comes to  office. His reckless tax cuts are not  paid for and hundreds of billions of dollars are added to our debt. A Medicare  prescription drug bill was not paid  for—wasn’t paid for—and was more expensive than the Republicans advertised. Add that on to our debt, plus two  wars that weren’t paid for.  When the first President George Bush  went to war against Saddam Hussein  when  Iraq  invaded Kuwait, he went  around and he got member nations in  the area to actually pitch in to help  pay  for the war so that the burden  wasn’t  only  on  the United States.  George Bush II comes into office—two  wars, we don’t pay for them. There’s no  tax on anybody. It gets onto our credit  card. That is just not right.  Men and women in uniform are sacrificing, their  families are sacrificing,  and the rest of us have been asked to  do nothing. They just put it on the  credit card. That is not right.  So, Mr. Speaker, I have a disagreement with the gentlelady not over the  issue of whether we need to reduce  waste and abuse in government. I have  an issue with her over the way they’re  doing it. They protect tax breaks for  big oil companies, tax breaks for Donald Trump and subsidies for corn ethanol, a big waste of money. All that’s  protected. And the way they balance  the budget is not by going after that.  They go after programs that help poor  people, LIHEAP, WIC—the Women, Infant and Children’s program of all  things—and Pell Grants. We all know  that in order to have a strong economy  in the 21st century, we need a well-educated workforce, and  they cut Pell  Grants. They just slash them. That’s  where  they’re  cutting,  cutting  programs that help average people, regular people and people who are vulnerable.  What government should be about is  making  sure  that  those people are  taken care of and not forgotten. Instead, their budget and their priorities  are protecting those who have a lot of  wealth who don’t need government.  And I think what they’re doing is misguided.  Let me just read one final thing here.  This is a story that just appeared on  Politico,  breaking  news.  President  Obama is calling House Speaker JOHN  BOEHNER and Senate Majority Leader  HARRYREIDback to the White House  to negotiate on the budget at 1 p.m.  Just before the announcement from the  White House, Senator REIDsaid on the  Senate floor that the numbers are basically there, but that the only thing  holding up an agreement is ideology.  He said he was not nearly as optimistic  about reaching a deal as he was last  night.  So, in other words, Mr. Speaker, this  is no longer about numbers. And I regret that so much has had to be cut in  order to satisfy my friends on the other  side of the aisle.  b1040  But now this is about ideology. They  have all these riders on these bills, riders that deal with abortion, National  Public Radio, and riders that undercut  EPA’s ability to ensure there is safe  drinking water and clean air. They are  insisting on all of these ideological riders to be attached to whatever budget  deal before they sign it. It is not about  the numbers anymore; it is about a  rigid, right-wing ideology.  So enough is enough, Mr. Speaker. I  urge my Republican colleagues to go  back to the negotiating table and negotiate in good faith, let’s get a deal, and  let’s move on to next year’s business.

581,12,2011-04-07,Mr. CANTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to inform our colleagues that the  House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and 12 p.m. for legislative business tomorrow. As the Members know,  this is a change from the original calendar.  Due  to  ongoing negotiations, Mr.  Speaker, surrounding continued appropriations  for the remainder of  fiscal  year 2011, I believe it is both appropriate and necessary for this House to  be in session tomorrow. I expect legislative business to include, but may not  be limited to, H.J. Res. 37, a resolution  of disapproval regarding the FCC’s recent Internet and broadband industry  practices regulation ruling.  Votes are possible at any time after  noon tomorrow. At this point, it is too  early to tell whether the House will  need to be in session this weekend. In  the case of  lapse  in appropriations,  however, I fully expect the House to  meet.  Mr. Speaker, we will not leave town  until we have fulfilled our obligation  to cut spending, to begin getting our  fiscal house in order, and to keep the  government  functioning.  Therefore,  Members should keep their schedules  for this weekend as flexible as possible.  ",2011
582,12,2011-04-07,Mr. HOYER., Will the majority leader  yield?  ,2011
583,12,2011-04-07,Mr. CANTOR.,  I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.  ,2011
584,12,2011-04-07,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the majority  leader for yielding, and I share his view  that we ought to keep the government  running for not only the sake of our  economy, but for the sake of all those  that rely on the Federal Government.  My friend has made the observation in  the past that shutting down the government, and I believe the Speaker has  made the same observation, was not a  rational policy for us to pursue.  I ask the gentleman, because I believe that the resolution that we will  be considering will not either pass the  Senate nor be signed by the President,  in light of that, and in light of the fact  that the majority leader of the Senate  and the Speaker have both indicated  that negotiations are ongoing, would  the gentleman agree to a unanimous  consent, as we have done so often in  the past when the majority Democrats  that were in control of the House and  the Senate disagreed with President  Bush, that we would have a hold-in-  place unanimous consent continuing  resolution, not changing the status on  either side of the negotiations, for 7  days, which would give the parties the  opportunity to come to an agreement.  My understanding from the leader of  the Senate is that we have agreed to  some $70 billion in cuts, which is a substantial way towards what you wanted  and a show that we share the view that  we need to have fiscal restraint.  So I ask my friend, if I made a unanimous consent request that we continue  the government authority to stay running until next Friday without changing  the  status quo  so  that neither  party would be disadvantaged and that  our government would, in fact, as the  gentleman observes is his objective, be  able to stay in service to the American  people?

586,40,2011-04-07,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," I would  point out, Madam Speaker, that this  bill would prevent a shutdown. This  keeps  the  government  operating.  That’s one aspect of it.  I yield 3 minutes to the very distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and former  chairman of the full committee, the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. YOUNG).  ",2011
587,40,2011-04-07,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.  Make no mistake about it: This is a  national defense appropriations bill.  This bill is based on one that was written under Chairman DICKS last year  and should have been brought to this  floor and passed into law last year. But  for some reason, this one, along with  every other appropriations bill, didn’t  see the light of day. This may not be  the most perfect defense bill that we’ve  ever produced here, but it is a good bill  and it will keep the Defense Department functioning.  And here’s the problem for those of  us who work every day of our lives in  national defense. We see what’s happening. Under a continuing resolution,  the Defense Department is getting terribly close, dangerously close, to affecting readiness, training, troops and  their families. This is not something  we can allow to continue.  Put away the politics. Understand  the importance of taking care of our  soldiers and our sailors and our airmen  and our marines and their families.  b 1220  Don’t make them go without a paycheck because most of them live from  paycheck to paycheck. That’s just not  right, but that’s the way it is.  Let’s pass this bill, put the politics  aside. Let us get the Department of Defense away from a continuing resolution that is having a very, very negative effect on our readiness and on our  training.  I want to compliment Chairman ROGERS for the good job that he has done  to get us to this point today. Let’s pass  this bill, and let’s get on with the business of the country, and especially defending  our  country  and  defending  those who defend our country.  ",2011
588,40,2011-04-07,Mr. DICKS.," Madam Speaker, I yield 4  minutes  to  the distinguished Democratic whip, Mr. HOYER, my good friend  from Maryland.  ",2011
589,40,2011-04-07,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding. How  I miss my magic  minute.  I want to say to the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee, how often  he and I have said, you know, when we  have these impasses, we need a clean  CR. This CR is unclean. This CR will  not get us to where you say you want  to get, Mr. Chairman, and that’s not  shutting  down  the  government,  because you know and I know the President will not sign this bill. Why? Because you put in poison pills that you  know are unacceptable to him. Why?  So you can get the votes on your side  of the aisle to vote for your bill to keep  the government open. Why is that difficult? Because so many of your folks,  unless they get 100 percent, are prepared to shut down the government.  You and I both know that, Mr. Chairman.  I have great respect for you. Very  frankly, I think you and I could go in  a room and solve this in the next 30  seconds, but you and I are not in that  room. It is time, as the Speaker has  said, to be adults.  Why is this viable piece of legislation  on the floor? Because you think you  can hold the government ransom for an  additional $12 billion.  I said that  I  would not support, after supporting the  first two—which I thought were reasonable to try to give us an opportunity to solve the differences that  exist between us—that I would not vote  for a third one, and I’m not going to  vote for this one. It won’t matter because it’s dead anyway, and you all  know it’s dead. But you’re banking on  the fact that you know we don’t want  to shut down government. What’s the  proof in the pudding? We did not shut  it down when we had disagreements  with George Bush because we believed  that reasonable people elected by a diverse community in America who had  differences of opinion were expected by  our public to come together, reason together, and act productively together.  Now very frankly, I don’t take a back  seat to anybody on this floor in my  support of defense or  the men and  women  in uniform, and Mr. YOUNG  knows that, my dear friend, not a back  seat to anyone. And yes, if we passed a  unanimous consent request to fund at  present levels, defense would continue.  Should we have passed a defense bill  last year? I think we should have. I’m  sorry we didn’t. I urged that we do it.  But the Senate, as you might recall,  would not allow any bills to come to  the floor, any bills—that is, the Republicans  in  the United States Senate  would not allow that to happen.  So now we are faced with not a let’s-  reason-together bill but an additional  $12 billion in cuts, which means that  week by week by week you think you  will get to what you want, not a compromise, not an agreement, but what  you want. And you will do it $5 billion  a week, $2 billion a week—this one is  $12 billion a week. And you have no expectation that that will pass or be  signed by the President, but you do it  to pretend you want to keep government in operations. Newt Gingrich has  said don’t worry about shutting down  the government, as he shut it down in  1995—and over Christmas—for 3 weeks,  in ’95 and ’96.  Ladies and gentlemen on my side of  the aisle, we ought to reject this specious political act which pretends that  we want to keep the government open.  ",2011

Their families here at home  are doing all they can to keep a brave  face and keep their family going while  their loved ones are abroad.  Sadly, because of the Senate’s inaction, these families now face an even  greater challenge. Unless the Senate  changes  course  and  listens  to  the  American people, our U.S. military  families will soon not receive their  paychecks. From my home State of Arkansas, we have over 5,000 active duty  servicemembers as well as 246 Army  National Guardsmen deployed to Afghanistan  and  Iraq. My  district  is  home to Little Rock Air Force Base,  where we have 5,500 airmen and over  15,000 military family members.  Think about this, ladies and gentlemen: the men and women facing our  enemies every day don’t know whether  they will get paid. As the standard  bearer for the free world, it is unacceptable and, really, just embarrassing  that America can’t pay its troops for  their service. This is not the time for  servicemembers and their families to  worry about when the next check will  arrive.  I support this bill.  ",2011

612,47,2011-04-07,Mr. DICKS.," I just want to summarize  again: I’m urging a ‘‘no’’ vote on this  continuing resolution. We have voted  twice, many of us on this side, for reasonable  continuing  resolutions  that  have gotten us to this point. This one  is unreasonable. The President has  made it clear that he will veto this bill.  I believe what the gentleman from  Maryland was attempting to do was  the smart and pragmatic thing, and  that was to go with a clean CR that  would have kept the government open,  that would have protected the troops,  made  sure  that  they got paid, and  would have passed the Senate and been  adopted by the President and signed  into law. But they have chosen to put  in a highly controversial rider on abortion in the District of Columbia which  is ideological. This is not something  that  a  serious  appropriations  committee would do in the middle of a government crisis, and I hope the American people will understand that.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

614,47,2011-04-07,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Thank  you, Madam Speaker.  Let’s try to summarize here. The  Democrats left us, when we took control of the House, in a mess. You hadn’t  passed a single appropriations bill. You  passed a CR until March 4. We prepared  and put into play and passed in the  House a  continuing  resolution  that  would have funded the government entirely for the balance of the year, including the military, and sent it to the  other body. And they have said nothing, and that was 2 months ago.  When that time ran out in March,  this body passed a second CR  for 2  weeks. Sent that to the Senate. We  haven’t heard from them since. That  time ran out. We passed a third CR. We  passed it to the Senate, not a peep.  Nothing.  And now a fourth time, now a fourth  CR where we are going to give the Senate another chance to come forward  with what they propose in a CR. They  have yet to pass anything. And I have  to say this, too: The White House has  been late in coming to the aid of their  party. The White House has been absent from the battle until the last few  days.  And now you come to us and say,  look, here’s what we complain about on  your cleaning up our mess. And I say to  you, this bill takes care of our military, our young men and women fighting in three wars on the other side of  the world. And the Commander in Chief  of the military is saying I’m going to  veto the bill that pays their salaries  and supports their families back home.  I  find that  inexplicable,  inexplicable  that the Commander  in Chief would  put an end to the pay of our soldiers.  The failure of the Senate to act and  the failure of the White House to act  when we pass this bill means a vote to  shut down the government. Vote ‘‘yes.’’  ",2011

616,89,2011-04-07,Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, it’s time to stop holding the American people hostage to the ideological whims of those  who don’t understand  that  responsible governing is the art of compromise. We are on  the sixth continuing  resolution  in as many  months for the current fiscal year. It’s time to  get the job done, and thankfully negotiations  are underway. Yet the bill we are considering  today undercuts that effort and the sincerity of  the majority to avoid a shutdown. This bill perpetuates the ‘‘my way or the highway’’ philosophy of House Republicans. It continues their  blind assault on vital services to constituents  in every community in America like education,  public safety, clean water and Social Security.  Further exposing their lack of sincerity, this bill  just puts  the hard decisions off  for another  week. Shutting down the government is not a  victory but a defeat for us, the American people and the democratic process. That’s why I  cannot be an enabler for a reckless, meat axe  approach to funding public services. Let’s reject  this short-term approach  in  favor of a  more responsible bill. We owe my constituents  and the citizens we all serve no less. Let’s do  our jobs.  ",2011
617,89,2011-04-07,Mr. WOLF.," Madam Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1363,  the Department of Defense  and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of  2011.  I am voting today for H.R. 1363 because I  do not support a government shutdown. H.R.  1363 will keep the government open. I am voting to ensure that federal employees are not  pawns  in a game of  ‘‘shut-down chicken.’’  I  am voting to ensure that FBI agents continue  on the job. I am voting to ensure that DEA  agents, ATF agents, U.S. Marshals, Border  Patrol Agents, and CIA agents, are on the job.  I am voting to ensure that tax returns filed by  mail and loans to small businesses continue to  be processed. I am voting to ensure that NIH  research and clinical trials continue. I am voting to ensure that veterans will be able to receive walk-in services at clinics. I am voting to  ensure  that  the government honors signed  contracts. I am voting to ensure that federal  employees, who are all essential, are able to  continue to do the work they do, day in and  day out, to keep our nation running.  I am also voting for H.R. 1363 because it  funds the Department of Defense for the rest  of the fiscal year. This bill provides economic  certainty to our troops and their families at a  time when they are sacrificing so much to support our military operations around the world.  We also need to provide that economic certainty to the entire federal workforce and the  American people who expect us to be on the  job working for them. We need to reach an  agreement on a spending plan for the remaining five and a half months of this fiscal year  and get on with the business of producing a  budget for FY 2012 with a resolve to continue  to take steps to reverse our nation’s mounting  debt and deficit spending.  I am voting for H.R. 1363 because it cuts  $12 billion  in discretionary spending  in one  week. Twelve billion dollars. This may well be  the  largest one week discretionary spending  cut ever passed  through  the House. The  measure before us today is another responsible step  in  the right direction until a  long  term agreement is reached.  The House has acted. Again and again,  House Republicans have voted  to keep  the  government open by  supporting  continuing  resolutions until a  long-term solution  for  the  rest of the fiscal year is reached. We are continuing to work to find a solution to the unfinished business  left by  the  leadership of  the  previous Congress. Passing H.R. 1363 will enable us to move forward on the fiscal oversight needed to ensure long term, fiscal solvency.  I am voting ‘‘yes’’ today because this measure continues our efforts  to  tackle  the debt  while keeping the government open.  ",2011
618,89,2011-04-07,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Madam Speaker, if the  majority were genuinely interested in avoiding  a government shutdown, they would bring a  clean, one week CR to the floor to give the  current negotiations time to reach a successful  conclusion. But  that’s not what we’re being  asked to vote on today.  Instead, in the most cynical demonstration  of bad faith, today’s legislation combines funding  for our  troops—which every Member of  this House supports, and which a clean CR  would provide—with  controversial  cuts and  ideologically extreme poison pills that the majority knows the nation doesn’t want and the  Senate and the President will not support.  As a result, in this moment of truth, the majority is deliberately choosing to dive headlong  into a government shutdown in order to pander  to  its Tea Party base while  the rest of  America  yearns  for honorable  compromise  and adult leadership.  As Ranking Member of  the Budget Committee, and someone who actually supported  the last two CRs, I am willing to work in good  faith with Members on both sides of the aisle  to break  the current  impasse. But  I will not  participate in this kind of eleventh hour partisan gamesmanship when our federal government’s operations are at stake.  ",2011

I have the privilege to represent both  Baylor University and Texas A&M. I  don’t think there are many Members  here in this House who have the opportunity to represent two schools that  advanced to the Elite Eight of the  NCAA Women’s tournament. However,  I do, and one of them went all the way  and won the national championship.  Also, as a member of the Texas Aggie  Class of 1976, I am especially thrilled  that the final score was 76–70.  Coaches Gary Blair and Vic Schaefer  and their staff should be commended  for  their  leadership  in guiding  the  Texas Aggies to their sixth straight  NCAA tournament and to their first  ever national title. Let me add that  Danielle Adams, the Aggies’ all-American senior, scored 30 points, the second  highest  total  in  championship  game history.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand before my colleagues and say that there  is no other coach, no other team nor  any other fan base that deserves this  more  than Coach Blair,  the Texas  Aggie Women’s Basketball team, and  the loyal fans at Texas A&M University.

625,96,2011-04-07,Mr. FLEMING.," Mr. Speaker, with respect to a possible shutdown, I have to  say that this is a direct result of a distinct lack of leadership.  Former Speaker PELOSI showed no  leadership in not even attempting to  submit a 2011 budget in the 111th Congress. Senator REID has been totally  unwilling to submit an alternative 2011  budget, and the President, until this  week, has totally checked out of the  process.

626,96,2011-04-07,Mr. TIPTON.," Mr. Speaker, today this  House took the unprecedented step of  doing the right thing. We stood up for  our men and women  in our Armed  Forces. However, Senator REIDand the  President had already announced before the vote was even taken that it  was going to be ‘‘dead on arrival.’’ Senator REIDsaid that it’s a fantasy.  Senator REID, let me give you a reality. The reality is that our men and  women in our armed services, who are  risking their lives for us, deserve better than the politics of usual.  Senator REID, we call on you, and we  call on the President of the United  States to stand with us who are standing for the American people: our men  and women in the Armed Forces, our  parents, grandparents, and our future  generations as well. We have to not  only protect our present but build for  our future and have actual fiscal responsibility in this country. You can  no longer be allowed to be the party of  ‘‘no’’: no  ideas, no solutions, simply  saying  ‘‘no’’  because  of  your  bankruptive ideas.  Now  is  the  time  for action. The  American people are counting on us.  f  Mr.  Speaker,  THE BUDGET CRISIS  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  HULTGREN). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 5, 2011, the  gentleman  from  California  (Mr.  GARAMENDI) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority  leader.  ",2011
627,96,2011-04-07,Mr.  GARAMENDI.,"  thank you.  I want to turn our attention to the  issues that are before us today and see  if we can have a better understanding  of what has taken place.  We just heard a little bit about honoring our troops. Let’s be very clear  about this. The Democratic Caucus in  this House, the President, and the Senate will always and have always honored our troops. We are in the midst of  a very serious budget crisis for this  year with very, very serious issues at  stake, and the Republicans chose to attach to the funding bill numerous cuts  that  devastate  important  programs  that affect  the well-being of  every  man, woman, and child in this Nation  and, indeed, around the world. Because  of those cuts, as well as certain language that was added to the bill, we  chose not to vote for the funding.  The President has  said, Stop  the  games. Stop playing around. Give us a  straight up and down on funding the  government without all of these add-  ons and games that are being played by  our Republican colleagues.  The President has asked for a clean  bill. We should give him a clean bill  and carry on to fund the government  and provide  for our troops and our  military families, and we will do that.  Now  let’s understand what  is  at  stake. Not only in the current year’s  budget, which is the next 7 months, but  in the year beginning on October 12,  the Republicans have put together a  proposal that would devastate seniors  and those who are unable to care for  and to provide themselves with medical services—in other words, those dependent upon the Medicaid program.  b1520  Very straightforward. The proposal  that was put out by the Republican  caucus 2 days ago would terminate and  stop Medicare as we know it today.  Medicare is a program in which every  working American pays  into  it, and  when they became 65, they expect to  receive the Medicare health care benefits that are guaranteed or at  least  have been guaranteed for the last 40-  some years. That’s a uniform benefit  package across this Nation. It is a very  successful program. It’s one that Americans literally live long enough to get  into. And yet the Republican caucus is  proposing to terminate it, to end the  Medicare program. And instead, turn  over the $400 billion a year that goes  into the Medicare services, turn it over  to the private health insurance companies—the biggest gift ever given to the  private health insurance companies.  I know those companies. I was the insurance commissioner in California for  8 years. And I spent most every day of  those 8 years chasing after the health  insurance companies, forcing them to  pay claims and stopping them from discriminating against people who had  preexisting conditions and developing  programs and policies that were underfunded,  underpaid,  and  underperformed.  That cannot happen to our seniors,  but that’s what the Republicans want  to do. And we need to stop it. And we  will because the seniors of this Nation  already sense what is at hand. They already know that the Republican budget  proposed would devastate one of the  two pillars of the social safety net that  every senior in this Nation at one time  or another depends upon.  The second pillar—we’ve already seen  the path that this is going to go on—in  2004, the Republican caucus, together  with the Republican President, George  W. Bush, proposed to privatize Social  Security.

628,103,2011-04-07,Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.," I  thank my friend and colleague from  the great State of New York, where our  congressional districts adjoin at that  New York-Pennsylvania border. I am  really proud to be with you on the floor  today to talk about this game changer,  as you referred to.  Mr. Speaker, we are facing critical  times—record debt, $14 trillion; skyrocketing gas prices,  in some places  over $4 a gallon and climbing; energy  dependence and addiction  to Middle  Eastern oil; and a volatile Middle East.  All  those  things  tie  together. And,  frankly, we’re here to talk about something that is a part of the solution on  how to get out from underneath each  one of those critical issues that is just  piling  on  this Nation,  the United  States of America, and that  is the  Marcellus shale natural gas. We are  proud to also have Marcellus shale underneath much of Pennsylvania. We  have New York and Pennsylvania, West  Virginia, parts of Ohio, parts of Virginia.  The Marcellus is just a tremendous  natural gas play. It’s something that  we have known has been there for a  very, very  long time, but the technology to access it is more of a recent  advent, and it is just so exciting. I’m  glad we are here to talk about all aspects of this tonight.  Over the  last month, the development of the Marcellus shale natural  gas play has been given national attention, in particular, a technical industry  term known as ‘‘hydraulic fracturing,’’  or ‘‘fracking,’’ a process utilized in oil  and gas production for almost a century and regulated now for decades. Oil  and gas workers have completed nearly  1 million fracking jobs nationally, safely and without adverse environmental  impact. Over the years, these technologies have been  refined and  improved for more efficient and environmentally safe use. In fact, Mr. Speaker,  I find that the rapid increase of technology as it comes from the natural  gas industry right now is just incredible. This is an industry that is literally very solid but is always looking  for that new opportunity on how to do  things even better.  Recently, the New York Times attempted to discredit the wealth and experience employed by the industry over  the years and the successful work of  government officials to properly regulate natural gas development. Through  half-truths  and,  frankly,  calculated  quote shopping, the New York Times  made unsubstantiated claims regarding  fracking and its impact on water quality and the environment. They repackaged old stories with sensational new  headlines, and they rehashed allegations against development of natural  resources vital for our country’s energy future.  Now  immediately  following  these  stories, the Pennsylvania Department  of Environmental Protection—which  has, frankly, jurisdiction over the drilling of natural gas  in the Keystone  State—responded, releasing tests that  show that water supplies downstream  of Marcellus shale gas drilling are safe.  This testing has addressed misinformation related to water quality in the  Commonwealth and validated with scientific data that municipal drinking  water is safe.  Mr. Speaker, each day in my district  there is news regarding the Marcellus  shale worthy of a national headline.  Through this resource and these technologies, 70 million homes and thousands of small businesses are paying  the lowest gas prices in years to heat  their homes. The lowest. Let me repeat  that. When you have gas prices, petroleum gas prices  that are at  record  highs, volatile highs for our vehicles,  natural gas prices at the same time are  at a record low. That’s where they have  a national headline. That is all because  of one thing. Natural gas in this country is largely domestically produced. It  is produced by American workers, and  it doesn’t have that volatility that you  see when you become reliant on countries such as in the Middle East.  Thousands of jobs are being created.  I have two counties in particular at the  epicenter. Actually, one of them adjoins your congressional district. The  lowest unemployment numbers probably in history, much lower than national  and State  averages. There’s  nothing better that you can do for a  person  than  create an  environment  that provides them a good-paying job,  and that is happening as a result of the  natural gas industry.  Each day, the local economy in my  district gets a little better, and every  moment the notion of an energy secure  America is easier to grasp. For me, I  define  ‘‘energy security’’ as shutting  off the pipeline from the Middle East.  I recognize that the largest amount  of our oil that we import is from Canada, and Canada is a good ally. I don’t  see any threats from Canadians other  than maybe when we get around to  hockey season between the teams. But  when it comes to the Middle East, I  think when we look at the volatility in  the Middle East today, in Egypt and  obviously Libya and Yemen, I mean,  we should end that addiction  immediately to Middle Eastern oil, and that  achieves energy security.  Now, when it comes to safety, there  can be no shortcuts, no loopholes, and  no exceptions, but sensationalism fails  to serve any good for anyone. Scare  tactics are dangerous when dealing  with such complicated and technical  matters as this. And that is what we  see with many of the headlines that we  articles written  have  been  reading,  with half-truths.  I am so very pleased that you are  hosting this hour today because we can  talk about facts and put the facts out  there. The same goes for dealing with  our Nation’s energy security. We need  to talk about facts. So I am pleased to  be with you, and I yield back at this  time.  ",2011
629,103,2011-04-07,Mr. REED.," Reclaiming my time, I  thank the gentleman for his comments  and I thank the gentleman for participating in this this evening.  When I first came to Congress back  in November of last year, after we took  office after our special election, one of  the issues, and a priority issue to our  office, is the Marcellus shale natural  gas development. One of the things  that I noted back in my district back  at home is that there is a lot of misinformation, as the gentleman identified  in his comments.  One thing that we sought to do is to  establish the Marcellus Shale Caucus, a  caucus of Members of Congress who  represent districts  that overlay  the  Marcellus shale formation, so that we  could come together as a body, as a  representative body, and bring the best  scientists and bring the best data and  bring the best information, not only to  the floor of the House, but back to our  districts.  I am pleased to be joined tonight as  cochair in that caucus as we have established  in this Congress, my good  friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. CRITZ),  who I believe has some comments that  he would like to share on this issue before we get into the presentation of the  facts  in  the  development  of  the  Marcellus shale.

630,103,2011-04-07,Mr. CRITZ.," Well,  thank you, ",2011
631,103,2011-04-07,Mr.  REED.," And, yes, serving as cochair for  the Marcellus Shale Caucus is truly an  honor because we do have such an opportunity before us. As Mr. REEDmentioned earlier, Mr. Speaker, this isn’t a  Democrat or a Republican issue. This  is a bipartisan issue because it’s about  economic opportunity for all of our regions.  Mr. Speaker, I am joining my colleagues to discuss the significant economic potential  that  the Marcellus  shale natural gas play has  for our  country.  As  you may  know,  the  Marcellus shale is the largest unconventional natural gas formation in the  United States. The shale is estimated  to hold almost 500 trillion cubic feet of  extractable natural gas currently valued at nearly $2 trillion.  As with most economic activity, the  impacts of the natural gas affect more  than  just specific  firms directly  involved in the industry. There are also  important employment and income effects on local businesses who supply  the industry, such as oilfield service  companies, restaurants, retailers and  hotels, in addition to effects that result  from  employees  spending  their  wages locally.

It is an honor to serve with you on  our Budget Committee as we  spent  countless hours yesterday dealing with  a saga of a budget for 2012. Just as  we’re trying to avoid a shutdown of  America’s government this very hour,  they are also pushing through  in a  rather rushed format a 2012 fiscal plan  that takes the pain and suffering of the  2011 plan and expands it exponentially.  They grow it drastically, the pain for  2012.  As you indicated, these are choices  that we have before us. I believe firmly  that our budgets, whatever level—Federal, State, local—are a reflection of  our values, our principles, our priorities. That’s where we are now, whether  we are trying to avoid a shutdown for  the 2011 fiscal year which is looming  over us, or whether we are putting together the 2012 fiscal plan. It is about  priorities and values and principles  that we hold near and dear. It is also a  statement on an economic agenda.  I have before me here this chart that  speaks about the 1.8 million jobs that  have been added since last year, since  2010; 1.8 million private sector  jobs.  You can see the precipitous drop that  came with the red ink of the close of  the Bush recession. And then early in  2009, we began to recover. We stopped  the bleeding of the recession, and it has  been a slow but steady and upward and  forward climb as we have introduced  new jobs into the private sector arena  that allows us to now work away at  those 8.2 million jobs that were lost  during the Bush recession.  Why we would want to stop that  progress is beyond me; but those are  the cuts that will be made here in the  2011 scenario, by which we are attempting to avoid a shutdown, and the 2012  budget where there are cuts to R&D  and to science and technology.  I served as president and CEO of  NYSERDA, the New York State Energy  Research and Development Authority,  prior to coming here a couple of years  ago. I saw firsthand what science and  tech means in terms of job growth and  expanding the opportunities.  b1730  And so these cuts that are part of the  2011 plan and the 2012 budget that we’re  dealing with  in double-dose  fashion  will mean  tremendous pain  for our  middle class families.  We need to commit to a jobs agenda.  The people told Democrats and Republicans alike  in campaign season  it’s  about jobs, jobs, jobs, and the economy. It’s not about growing another  pricetag, draining our economy with  the cost of a shutdown. We need to  avoid that shutdown.  One of the concerns yesterday when  we were meeting on the 2012 budget format was—my concern, your concern,  our  concern as Democrats on  that  Budget Committee—to avoid the end of  Medicare. This plan, introduced by our  Republicans on the Budget Committee,  is called the ‘‘roadmap.’’ And I said it’s  a road to ruin for our middle class, for  our working families. They want to end  Medicare, a system that has worked for  over 40 years for 46 million Americans.  And what does it do? It shifts risk from  government over to the senior citizen.  It asks the senior citizen to dig deep  into the pocket, and then every year  dig deeper.  They are already suggesting that the  beneficiaries’ costs will more than double by the year 2022 and then more than  triple by the year 2030. Is this what  we’re about? Are these our values? Are  these our principles? Are these our priorities? I would say boldly, no, they are  not. They are not. And senior citizens  are already getting wind of this idea,  and they are supporting our efforts to  stop the end to Medicare, which is part  of the  format that they have  introduced, part of the legislation they have  introduced for their budget for 2012.  We failed in that attempt. You and I  supported it—GWENMOOREhas joined  us I see. We all supported that push to  end their desire to end Medicare. We  failed with it, and that will be coming  to a vote before the full House I think  next week.  So these are the things that people  need to be alerted to. These are the  issues that are going to be tough for  middle class America to assume for the  poor, the working poor, for the masses  out there. And when we see the concentration of wealth and all the benefits and all the focus being in just the  upper  echelon, we understand what  their choices are. Their choices are different than ours—they’re with Big Oil,  they’re with big banks, they’re with  special interests, they’re with millionaires, billionaires. They’re with handouts to the oil companies that are sitting on record profits of over $1 trillion. We’re there with the middle class  families, the working families, making  certain that we create jobs, retain jobs,  and keep this pattern of activity going.  Thank you, Representative YARMUTH,  for bringing us together  for what  I  think  is an urgent, urgent dialogue  that needs to reach every household in  America.  ",2011

661,131,2011-04-07,Mr. BEGICH.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak about the Wyden-Coats-Begich  bipartisan Tax Fairness Simplification  Act. It is that time of the year again,  tax  time. Across our Nation,  small  businesses and families are struggling  to unravel the annual nightmare of paperwork required to file their taxes.  Across our Nation,  small businesses  and families are struggling. My wife  and I are small business owners so I especially understand how burdensome  and expensive the Tax Code and filing  process can be for folks at this time of  year.  This process  is costly and burdensome. The IRS estimates that Americans spend 6.1 billion hours each year  filling out tax forms and roughly $163  billion each year on tax compliance.  Small businesses are the engine and  the backbone of our still recovering  economy. We  should allow  them  to  spend more time doing what they do  best—creating  jobs and growing  the  economy—not filling out burdensome  paperwork. This is why I have joined  my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle, Senators WYDEN and COATS, to  introduce the bipartisan Tax Fairness  and Simplification Act.  Tax reform has been a long priority  of mine. I am happy to be moving forward on this important piece of legislation today. In a nutshell, our legislation simplifies the Tax Code and alleviates many of the burdensome paperwork and costly requirements that are  bogging down American families and  businesses. Our legislation will allow  most taxpayers to file their taxes using  a straightforward and shortened 1-page  1040 IRS form. This is an example of exactly what it would look like. Also individuals and families will be able to  request that the IRS prepare a tax return for them to review, modify, and  sign.  The Wyden-Coats-Begich bill reduces  the number of tax brackets for individuals from six to three: 15 percent, 25  percent, and 35 percent. It eliminates  the alternative minimum  tax which  forces millions of  taxpayers  to calculate their taxes twice and pay the  higher amount. In order to make capital investments more cost effective for  small  business  owners,  the Wyden-  Coats-Begich bill will allow 95 percent  of small businesses—those with gross  receipts of up to a million dollars—to  expense all equipment and inventory  costs in a single year. These changes  may seem simple and commonsense,  but they make a world of difference to  our middle-class  families and  small  businesses.  Let’s talk specifically about small  businesses for a second, people who are  keeping our economy going, such as  my friend John Brower from Anchorage. John owns and operates Alaska  Laser Printing  in Anchorage. John  works tirelessly, 365 days a year, and is  proud of the business he built. When  new technology  is developing  in the  printing business, it is always bringing  on needs for new equipment. This legislation would allow him to expense all  those equipment costs and would truly  make a world of difference for John  and save him thousands and thousands  of dollars in taxes.  I am here to speak  for the John  Browers and the other small businesses  all across Alaska and the country. My  view is very simple: Let’s quit giving  tax breaks to multimillion-dollar corporations. Let’s close  the corporate  loopholes and help  small businesses  such as John Brower’s.  Right now we are facing a $14.3 trillion deficit. We are hours away from a  potential government shutdown rather  than continuing on a path toward long-  term economic recovery.  Our new bill actually promotes economic growth because it allows businesses to spend more time growing and  less time worrying about the overly  burdensome tax system which we all  know only enables tax avoidance. As  all of us around here know, tax avoidance means outsourcing jobs overseas.  Instead,  our  legislation  incentivizes  and enables companies  to  invest  in  America  rather  than  incentivizing  them to invest overseas.  The legislation also promotes responsible  retirement  savings and  investments by expanding tax-free savings  opportunities.  The  American  Dream  Account,  whether it is for a new home, education  for your children, or health care, provides a unique opportunity to invest in  the American dream. Families and individuals alike can make contributions  to an account that functions much like  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:27 May 09, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S07AP1.REC S07AP1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

During his 10 years as Governor, the State enjoyed extraordinary  success. At a time when many States  were struggling financially, North Dakota had bulging surpluses and low unemployment, almost entirely as a result of the outstanding job then-Governor HOEVENdid in representing the  people of North Dakota. So, as I say, it  is no surprise that they sent him to  join us here in the Senate by an overwhelmingly large majority, and I congratulate him on behalf of all of our  colleagues on his initial speech.

His wife  and my wife have been very good  friends.  What you heard is basically a background of the success he has had in the  leadership of his great State. What you  don’t know  is his ability  to  reach  across the aisle in a bipartisan manner.  I can only say that JOHN is a dear  friend, and JOHN is the type of personality we need in this body to mend this  partisan gridlock in which we find ourselves. I cannot tell you how pleased I  am to still be a colleague of his, and I  look forward to many years of success  working together, reaching out, finding  the problems we have, addressing the  problems, and then, like a good Governor,  taking  them on and making  some good decisions, as he has done so  well in North Dakota.

669,138,2011-04-07,Mr. TESTER.," Madam President, this  week I got an e-mail from a first grader  in Missoula, MT, 7 years old. Her note  read:  Senator Tester, please pass a budget so  that I can go to Yellowstone National Park  this weekend, or at least wait until Monday  to shut down the government.  I get a lot of letters and calls reminding me what is at stake. Yet some of  our colleagues continue to put politics  ahead of doing what is right. I will always remember that e-mail from Missoula. Even 7-year-olds expect us to get  our job done. They expect us to work  together to pass a budget. They expect  us to work together to make responsible cuts. They expect us to make sure  we don’t put our government and the  entire economy on life support. That is  exactly what will happen if some in  Congress  let  the  government  shut  down. They will fail all of us.  If drawing a line in the sand becomes  more  important  than working  together, I think that  is a shame. Of  course, we can’t afford the status quo  either. We all know the problem. Everyone wants to point fingers. I could  spend my time pointing at those who  thought it was a good idea to put two  wars we are fighting on the taxpayers’  credit card or those who squandered a  $128 billion budget surplus in a matter  of months about 10 years ago. But I  will  leave  it at this: Our debt and  spending  problem  is not  something  that we got into overnight, and it is  not something we will get out of overnight.  It is not going to be fixed by slick  talking points ginned up by Washington, DC, consultants. It will not be  fixed by symbolic gimmicks. It certainly will not be fixed by irresponsible  decisions such as ending Medicare as  we know it. It will not be fixed by gutting student financial aid or physical  infrastructure. Those create jobs now  when our economy needs it the most.  Our spending and debt problem will  be fixed by embracing a responsible,  credible, long-term strategy to cut our  debt;  to cut  spending, discretionary  and mandatory—right now we are talking about cuts to only 12 percent of the  budget known as discretionary spending—to  strengthen  our  entitlement  programs so they work for future generations; to reform our Tax Code so it  is fair and sustainable; and to cut our  defense where we can afford to cut.  We owe it to all Americans to get the  job done. But we owe it to them to get  the job done responsibly, and that is  going to require some buy-in. But we  have done it before.  During the Great Depression, people  endured incredible sacrifice. But they  had  inspirational  leadership to challenge them to grow their way to prosperity. In World War II, they worked  together and made sacrifices at home  to build the machinery that helped us  win victory. That momentum also created a powerful middle class. The attacks of September 11 brought us together  again,  and  again we  grew  strong.  When we work together, we succeed.  It is in our DNA. It is what makes us  the strongest, most innovative nation  in the world. Now we have to summon  that strength and determination again,  to lead our way out of our economic  challenges.  It will not happen with  gimmicks. It is going to take responsible decisionmaking, compromise, and  shared sacrifice.  Several of our colleagues in the Senate are already leading the way. I compliment Senators CHAMBLISS, COBURN,  CONRAD, CRAPO, DURBIN, and WARNER.  They  are working  on  a  bipartisan  strategy to cut debt and cut spending.  Their plan will include cuts to discretionary spending. It will make our entitlement programs stronger.  It will  propose cuts to defense spending. And  it will include tax reform.  Last year, Senator Alan Simpson and  Erskine Bowles led a bipartisan commission  in outlining a  smart,  long-  term, credible strategy for cutting debt  and spending. Senator Simpson and Mr.  Bowles say they had 14 reasons for volunteering their time on the Debt Commission. Between them, they have 14  grandkids.  While I may not embrace every component of their plan, I applaud their  hard work, their leadership, their patriotism. Their hard work is a solid  blueprint we are already building from.  I am ready to join them, and so are  many of us in this Chamber. We need  to do it.  Montanans are patriots. They are  ready and willing to follow our lead in  providing a fair Tax Code that provides  certainty and fairness. They are willing to share in the pain of responsible  spending cuts that will not take our  economy backwards. They know we  can afford to make cuts  in defense.  They know we need to fix—but not dismantle or privatize—our entitlement  programs.  What  is the alternative? Well, we  may find out the hard way if folks are  not willing to work together to reach  agreement  by midnight  tomorrow.  Shutting down the government means  our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will  not get their paychecks on time—even  though they will still be serving us.  This week, I heard from a soldier deployed  in Afghanistan. He  said he  would be OK in a short shutdown because he has some savings. But if their  paychecks stop coming, a lot of his fellow soldiers will be hurt. Many have  lower ranks. Many have pressing financial obligations such as mortgages and  car payments, kids to take care of.  They would get the short end of the  stick.

670,152,2011-04-07,Mr. INHOFE.," I came to the conclusion that on Wednesday, April 6—that  marked the 17th anniversary of the terrible thing that happened in Rwanda,  the genocide—and we have information  that actually Secretary General Kofi  Annan had knowledge of that. It wasn’t  shared. We didn’t have warning, and we  all know 800,000-plus people were brutally murdered in Rwanda during that  genocide.  What I wish to do now is make sure  we are on record in warning the United  States, France, and the United Nations  what is going on right now.  First of all, if we look—they say it is  all decided, everyone has made up their  minds, yet President Obiang—President Obiang of Equatorial Guinea. He  is also the current President of the African Union, or the chief of the African  Union. He is on record saying that Africa must be allowed to manage its own  affairs, and this is a quote:  Africa does not need any external influence. Africa must manage its own affairs.  This is the President who is the head  right now of the African Union.  President Sarkozy has said—so there  is no doubt about whether he has authorized his troops to go in there and  participate  in these raids that have  taken place, two of them that I will describe in a minute. French President—  this is reported on BBC News—Nicolas  Sarkozy said in a statement he had authorized 1,600 strong French Licorne  forces in the country.  That shows definitely, and I don’t  think anyone is questioning that. Here  is another one:  One source said soldiers from a 1,000-strong  French Licorne force—  This is a very strong force—  in the Ivory Coast has been deployed in Zone  4, in the south of the city.  I think also it is important to see  that France has authorized its military—and I am reading now from the  same report:  France has authorized its military to participate in a United Nations operation in the  Ivory Coast to protect civilians against escalating violence there. The Elysee Palace said  the operation aimed  to neutralize heavy  weapons belonging to troops loyal to President Gbagbo.  So he is talking about sending them  in. Of course, I think most of us—I will  go ahead and read one more thing here  that  I think  is significant:  ‘‘French  helicopters opened fire on a military  camp in Abidjan on Monday.’’  That is going to go down in history  as ‘‘Black Monday.’’  If anyone wants to see what was happening with helicopters and rockets firing on all kinds of targets near the palace  in  the  residence  in Abidjan of  Ouattara, go to my Web site. We have  pictures of that.  Earlier,  French  President  Nicholas  Sarkozy  said he had authorized France’s  military to  join a U.N. operation against  forces  loyal  to  Ivory  Coast’s  Laurent  Gbagbo.  So, clearly, they are the ones who  had—I want to say this: There are two  major assaults on Cote d’Ivoire. I mistakenly thought that the French were  involved in the one in a city called  Duekoue. I  find out  later that they  weren’t.  They were  supporting,  of  course, Ouattara—the forces that were  there, but they did not have a direct  participation  in  it.

671,159,2011-04-07,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Wyoming.  ,2011
672,159,2011-04-07,Mr. BARRASSO.," Mr. President, I rise  as someone who lives in a State where  we balance our budget  every year,  where  the citizens of Wyoming and  families all across the State live within their means, balance their budgets.  They know what it means to have to  live within a budget. That is why our  State is one that currently today does  not have a deficit, does not have a  debt, a State where every year, by constitutional mandate, we balance our  budget. It is time for Washington to  take a lesson from Wyoming and balance  its  budget. This  irresponsible  spending must stop.  Here we are, a day  from when  it  looks as if we may be dealing with a  government shutdown, and I am ready  to vote. I am ready to vote for a bill  that already passed the House of Representatives early today. I am ready to  vote to keep the government open and  functioning, to make sure services are  there. The bill passed the House. People who have studied civics in school  realize that is how we make a law in  this country. It passes the House, the  Senate, goes  to  the President, who  signs it into law. The bill has already  passed the House. It is coming to the  Senate. I don’t know where other Senators are, but I am ready to vote.  I heard my colleague talk about a  shutdown and who was rooting for a  shutdown. It is no surprise to people  who may be watching at home that it  is  former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean who is  rooting  for a shutdown. The  former  chairman of the Democratic National  Committee says:  I think it would be the best thing in the  world to have a shutdown. He is the spokesman for the party of the other side of the  aisle. That may be what he wants. I don’t  want to do that. I want to vote for the bill  that passed the House. It is the only proposal  that is out there. I haven’t seen the Democrats offer anything. Even the New York  Times said of the President that he was ‘‘silent for too long.’’  We have heard our previous speaker  talk about the social issues. Let’s remember that it is convenient amnesia  for Democrats to talk about that specific issue because the President voted  for and signed into law spending bills  that  included  similar—actually  the  identical social issue in the past, the  one he is opposing today. So did 49 current  Senate Democrats. They  also  voted  for a spending bill that dealt  with that social issue. Why all of a sudden today it is different? I believe it  has to do with what the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee said:  I think it would be the best thing in the  world to have a shutdown.  Republicans are proposing solutions.  What do we see from the other side of  the aisle? We see the senior Senator  from New York saying, ‘‘I always use  the word ‘extreme.’’’ It doesn’t matter  what is proposed. He says, ‘‘I always  use the word  ‘extreme.’’’ There are  tape recordings of him saying this. He  then said, ‘‘That is what the caucus instructed me to use this week.’’ Regardless of how reasonable a proposal may  be,  regardless of  the  solutions  that  may be proposed,  ‘‘I always use the  word ‘extreme.’ That is what the caucus instructed me to use this week.’’  I travel back and forth to Wyoming  every weekend, visit with people and  sit around at different locations, sometimes  a morning  breakfast  group,  sometimes it is people at lunch, dinners, community meetings.  I ask them: How many of you believe  you have a life that is better than your  parents had?  Every hand goes up.  Then I ask: How many of you believe  your children will have a better life  than you have right now?  Very few hands go up. That is the  problem.  I ask them: What  is the concern?  Why do you believe you have a better  life than your parents did but your  children will not have as good a life as  you?  The answer they give is the debt, the  reckless  spending  in Washington—  reckless,  irresponsible, unsustainable.  Yet, when we want to go ahead today,  do cuts in spending, keep the military  going, deal with the issue at hand, keep  the government functioning so we can  come back and continue to work on the  debt and the spending, this body is not  ready to vote.  I am ready to vote. I am ready to  vote  for  the only proposal on  the  table—the one the Republicans in the  House of Representatives passed today.  That is real leadership. It is a plan. It  will work. It is what the American people are asking for.  I have people from Wyoming coming  to Washington all the time. They say:  We realize things are tough this year.  They come and explain a program that  is good for people in the community,  good for children, good for seniors—I  met with six or seven groups like that  today—good  for  students  in  school.  They say: We know that all of us are  going to have to deal with the realities  of the facts, that we can’t continue  with this unsustainable spending where  40 cents out of every dollar we spend is  borrowed,  significant  amounts  from  overseas. Our No. 1 lender is folks in  China.  I say:  Is that your concern?  That is absolutely the concern I hear  around the State of Wyoming.  They see that the President of China  comes over and tells America a few  weeks ago that he wants the Chinese  currency to be the currency of the future and the dollar to be the currency  of the past. That is because he knows  we have an addiction to spending, and  it must stop. That is what I hear from  people from Wyoming who come here  as well. They say: We need to make  sure we get the spending under control.  It seems reasonable to get back to  the level of 2008 spending. That is the  level many American families are living under. They balance their budgets.  It is time for Washington to do the  same.  I know the people in Wyoming. I have  visited with a number  through  the  week and in many communities last  weekend—in Worland,  Caspar,  Laramie. What they are saying is, get the  spending under control, and do it in a  reasonable manner. But for someone to  come from the other side of the aisle  and say he thinks the best thing in the  world to do is to have a shutdown and  for another person to say he always  uses the word ‘‘extreme’’ because that  is what his caucus instructed him to  use this week—that doesn’t solve the  problem. That doesn’t let us find a solution. There is a solution on the table  right now. It is a solution that has  been proposed. This Senate ought to be  voting on it tonight.  For the President to say he is going  to veto it shows that the President is  truly not engaged in this process. He  has been silent too long, according to  the New York Times. His budget that  he has proposed,  the Economist, a  world-renowned, respected publication,  called  ‘‘dishonest.’’ That  is not  the  kind of leadership we need. We need  someone in the White House fully engaged, taking an active role, and making sure we get back on a course that  is responsible, that allows us to live  within our means, as families know,  because we  have  to  stop  spending  money we do not have. Stop spending  money we do not have. That is the way  for Washington to behave in a responsible way, to make the difficult decisions necessary for the future of the  country, to focus on the issues that affect families and their needs. Families  who are trying to deal with kids and  bills and a mortgage know what  it  means to have to  live within their  means.  When we see policies coming out of  this administration that are ones making the pain at the pump even worse, as  families are noticing they are paying  $700 on average more for gasoline this  year than last year, that is money that  is not available for other bills or for a  mortgage or to help with their kids.  Those are the issues they are facing,  people  trying  to pay  for  their own  health  insurance,  realizing  the  increased cost of the insurance because  of the Obama health care  law that  passed way over the objections of the  American people, crammed down the  throats of the American people by the  other side of the aisle.  The American people are saying: This  is absolutely wrong. That  is why  I  think we saw last November the election results we did across the country.  That is why we see people continuing  to stand up and speak out across the  country. That is why people continue  to go to townhall meetings and share  their views about the problems happening in this country.

676,166,2011-04-07,Mr. BENNET.," Mr. President, I came  to the floor the other night to talk  about what I had learned in 2 years of  townhall meetings in Colorado regarding our deficit and regarding our debt.  What I said the other night was that  people  in our State, whether  in red  parts of the State or blue parts of the  State, have a commonsense way of approaching this, and they have a three-  part test they want to apply.  The first test is they want to make  sure we actually come up with something  that materially addresses  the  problem we face. They are tired of gimmicks. They are tired of tricks. They  want us to sort this out. They know it  will not be fixed overnight, but they  want us to get started on it.  The second test is that we are all in  it together. They are tired of the us-  against-them conversation  that happens in Washington. They are tired of  hearing that one person’s ox is going to  be gored or one group of people’s ox is  going to be gored and everyone else  will be left alone. Everybody wants to  contribute to solving this problem.  The third test is they want it to be  bipartisan. Because, frankly, they do  not have confidence in either party on  this  issue and they want to see us  working together.  That is it. We should be working toward that as a Senate and as a House.  We should be having a serious conversation about how not to leave our  children stuck with a bill of $15 trillion  in debt and a $1.5 trillion deficit. I feel  that keenly, as the father of three little girls myself.  But I think it is very important for  the American people to understand the  debate we are having right now. The  threat that we are going to shut the  government down has nothing to do  with the broader conversation about  our deficit and our debt. In fact, shutting the government down is going to  make matters worse.  I said the other night that there is  not a superintendent of schools—I used  to be one in Colorado—there is not a  city council or a mayor in Colorado,  from the largest city to the smallest  town, who would dream—who would  dream—of saying to their constituents:  We can’t work this out, so we are going  to close the government next week. We  can’t work this out, so we are not  going to plow your snow next week or  pick up your trash next week or educate your kids next week, not one local  official in our State. The Presiding Officer knows this. He was a mayor. He  would never have gone to his constituents and said: Oh, by the way, we are  closing next week because we have a  disagreement.  It makes no sense. Nowhere on the  planet would that make any sense. To  say nothing of the fact we find ourselves at a moment in the country’s  history when we are engaged in wars  all across the globe, when we are now  involved  in a multilateral effort  in  Libya, when we have thousands of people—government employees—trying to  help the Japanese weather this unbelievable tragedy they are facing, when  we have economic competitors all over  the globe trying to seek an economic  advantage against the United States in  the 21st century. Yet we are saying:  Well, we are going to take a time out  because we can’t agree. We are going to  pause, take a rest, close the government.  The  American  people must  think, well, you guys must be very far  apart. That is why I brought this chart.  I don’t know the exact details here. Nobody does. The reports on the news tonight were that several billion dollars  separated the negotiators. I have heard  it ranges from $5 billion to $10 billion,  or somewhere in there, so I picked the  number $7 billion, which is more than  several. But that appears to be what divides the parties—$7 billion. Seven billion dollars.  That is a lot of money. It is a lot of  money. But look at it in the context of  our deficit and our operating budget.  Here is this line. You can’t even see it.  This line is the $7 billion, right here.  This is our deficit, and this is our operating budget—$1.5 trillion, $3.6 trillion.  I  apologize, Mr. President,  but  I  couldn’t fit it on one chart so I had to  have two made in order to show what  the order of magnitude of difference is  between what we are squabbling over  here in Washington, and what our deficit looks like and what our operating  budget looks like. That is it. That is it.  That is it.  Do you know, this difference, if this  were  the city of Alamosa—and  the  former mayor is the Presiding Officer—  and my State—which has roughly a $14  million operating budget  in the San  Luis Valley—if they were saying we  were going to shut down our government based on  this difference,  that  would be like Alamosa saying, we can’t  figure it out because $27,000 is what we  are apart.  Mr. President, if you and I went to  Applebee’s tonight and we had their $20  dinner for two, and then we had a fight  over the bill, we would be fighting over  4 cents. That is what would separate  us—roughly  .19 percent of our operating budget.  I could even understand if the parties  were saying we disagree, we disagree,  let’s keep negotiating. But I can’t for  the life of me understand how on those  terms anyone could threaten a government  shutdown, especially when we  confront  the  dangers  we  confront  today.  And so the answer is, it is not about  our budget. The time we have consumed here is taking time away from  the conversations that the Presiding  Officer and I have been part of, that  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:27 May 09, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S07AP1.REC S07AP1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011
677,173,2011-04-07,Mr. BARRASSO.," Madam President, I  am pleased to recognize the Centennial  of Platte County, WY.  Although today’s Platte County  is  vastly different than that of 100 years  ago, its vibrant history connects the  two. The early inhabitants, who were  then part of Laramie County, campaigned passionately for the division of  the  county. They had distinguished  themselves as functional communities,  and they contributed to the State’s  economy by strengthening their ties to  the railroad, agricultural development,  and mining industries. They wanted an  independent identity. On April 28, 1911,  a headline in the Wheatland World jubilantly announced,  ‘‘County division  carries! Platte County a reality.’’ Their  success represents Wyoming’s spirit of  independence.  Platte County consists of 8,200 residents  in  the  five  communities  of  Wheatland,  Guernsey,  Hartville,  Glendo,  and  Chugwater.  Parts  of  Wheatland’s unique irrigation system  are still visible. In the early 1880s, engineers created a system of canals to  transport water  from manmade  reservoirs through the mountains to the  town below. Such foresight assisted in  the taming of a small section of the  great Wild West. A few miles outside of  Guernsey stands Register Cliff, a sandstone outcropping upon which  emigrants recorded their names and dates  as they traveled the historic Oregon  Trail. Wagon ruts from the trail are  also visible and remind us of the grand  journey  people made. The  Sunrise  Mine, located just outside of Hartville,  was one of the largest iron mines in the  country, producing over 42 million tons  of iron ore during its 80-year operation.  Platte County is the only county in  Wyoming with two State parks: Guernsey State Park and Glendo State Park.  Both parks contribute to the area’s irrigation systems, as well as provide excellent year-round recreational opportunities for Wyoming residents. Livestock production has always been a  major  enterprise  in  Wyoming;  Chugwater earned distinction as the  headquarters for Swan Land and Cattle  Company, one of the largest cattle outfits  in the United States. Now, new  generations of ranchers continue the  cattle legacy.  Today, Platte County helps meet  America’s  growing  energy  demands.  The Laramie River Station powerplant,  located northeast of Wheatland, delivers electricity to two separate power  grids and is one of the largest consumer-operated,  joint  power  supply  ventures in the country. Strides have  been made in developing renewable energy  technology,  including plans  to  harness Wyoming’s wind. Also impressive is Platte County’s proximity to  the Niobrara Shale Formation, a shale  rock formation that covers four States  in the West. Drilling beneath this formation will provide numerous opportunities for oil and natural gas production.  Madam President, in celebration of  the 100th anniversary of Platte County,  I invite my colleagues to visit this historic place. This year, the Platte County Centennial Committee has planned  several  countywide  celebrations and  has announced its motto, ‘‘The People,  the Land: Past, Present and Future.’’ I  applaud the citizens of Platte County  in their efforts to celebrate such rich  history and to present it to visitors  from all over the world.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  TRIBUTE TO DR.

679,180,2011-04-07,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President. I rise  today to introduce two bills that would  lay a strong foundation to improve the  Federal acquisition system.  The first bill, the Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act of 2011, S. 761,  co-sponsored by Senators AKAKA and  MCCASKILL, would create a Federal acquisition management fellows program  to develop a new generation of acquisition leaders with government-wide perspective, skills, and experience.  The second bill, the Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act of 2011,  S.  762,  co-sponsored  by  Senators  AKAKA, MCCASKILLand BROWNof Massachusetts, would provide much-needed  organizational clarity  to enable  the  Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to  fulfill its mission of facilitating career  development and better management  of the federal acquisition workforce.  The Federal acquisition  system  is  under tremendous stress. Between fiscal years  2000 and  2010, acquisition  spending by the federal government expanded by 163 percent, from $205 billion  to $535 billion. The necessary costs of  military operations, natural disasters,  homeland  security  precautions,  and  other vital programs will continue to  strain the acquisition system in the  years ahead.  This  unprecedented  level  of  purchasing creates abundant opportunities  for fraud, waste, and abuse. We have  seen far too many outrageous failures  in government contracting. The Secure  Border Initiative Network, the Census  Bureau’s handheld computers for the  2010 Census, and  the Marine Presidential Helicopter programs are among  recent, notorious and costly acquisition failures, which we can ill afford.  These  and  other  failures  demand  strong steps to protect taxpayer dollars and deliver better acquisition outcomes.  As a long-time advocate for stronger  competition, accountability, and transparency in government contracting, I  recognize the actions the Administration has taken recently to improve federal contracting. Many of these initiatives originated from legislation I co-  authored with Senator LIEBERMANduring the 110th Congress.  But, no matter how many laws we  pass  or  guidance  documents  OMB  issues, the effectiveness of our Federal  acquisition system ultimately depends  on a vital human component—the acquisition workforce.  While contract  spending has  risen  dramatically, the number of acquisition  professionals  who  help  plan,  award, and oversee these contracts has  been stagnant. And with roughly half  of the current acquisition workforce eligible to retire by 2018, the difficulties  of strengthening that workforce are becoming  increasingly  acute. A well-  trained and adequately sized acquisition workforce is critical to managing  and overseeing  federal  spending and  the increasingly complex procurements  of services and goods.  The two pieces of legislation I am introducing today are designed to address these important long-term goals.  The Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act would create a centrally  managed, Government-wide Acquisition Management Fellows Program  that combines both a Master’s degree-  level academic curriculum and on-the-  job training in multiple federal agencies. By partnering with leading universities that have specialized government acquisition programs, the government can attract top-caliber students  and retain our best government employees who are interested in pursuing  both academic advancement and public  service.  Compared  to  the  several existing,  agency-specific  intern programs, this  government-wide program would provide a much-needed skill set that we  currently do not have  in  sufficient  number;  that  is, acquisition professionals with multi-agency and multi-  disciplinary training who can understand and manage government-wide acquisition needs and perspectives.  Considering that interagency acquisition now accounts for approximately 40  percent of the Federal Government’s  entire contract spending, and that GAO  has  designated  the management  of  interagency  contracting  a  high-risk  area since 2005, it is evident that we  need to develop future acquisition leaders who understand government-wide  needs and perspectives and are able to  operate effectively outside of the traditional, single-agency environment.  Specifically, the Acquisition Management Fellows Program would include  one academic year of  full-time, on-  campus training followed by 2 years of  on-the-job and part-time training toward a Masters or equivalent graduate  degree  in related  fields; and a curriculum that would include rotational  assignments at three or more executive  agencies covering, among other issues,  acquisition planning, cost-estimating,  formation and post-award administration of ‘‘high risk’’ contract types, and  interagency contracts.  Upon graduation, participants will  have completed all required, non-agency-specific training courses necessary  for a basic contracting officer warrant.  In addition, participants would be required to enter into a service commitment to ensure the Federal Government receives a proper return on its investment. The  service  commitment  would be no less than 1 year for each  year a participant is in the program,  and would require reimbursement of  funds for those who do not successfully  complete the program or do not fulfill  the minimum service requirements.  Our second bill, the Federal Acquisition Institute Improvement Act, would  strengthen the Federal Acquisition Institute, FAI, whose key responsibilities  are to promote career development and  strategic human capital management  for  the  entire  civilian  acquisition  workforce.  The FAI has remained largely underutilized due to a lack of organizational  clarity, the disproportionate  funding  compared to its counterpart in the Department of Defense, and its intermittent use by a few Federal agencies.  The proposed legislation would establish a clear line of responsibility and  accountability for the Institute by requiring that FAI, through its Board of  Directors, report directly to the Office  of Federal Procurement Policy, OFPP;  the director of FAI be appointed by the  OFPP Administrator, and report directly to the OFPP Associate Administrator for Acquisition Workforce; all  existing civilian agency training programs  follow  guidelines  issued  by  OFPP, which would ensure consistent  training  standards necessary  to develop uniform core competencies; and  the OFPP Administrator report annually to Congressional committees of jurisdiction projected FAI budget needs  and expense plans to fulfill its statutory mandate.  With respect to its core government-  wide functions, FAI would be required  to provide and keep current government-wide training standards and certification requirements  including ensuring effective agency  implementation of government-wide training and  certification standards; analyzing the  curriculum to ascertain if all certification competencies are covered, or if  adjustments are necessary; developing  career-path  information  for certified  professionals to encourage retention in  government  positions;  and  coordinating with the Office of Personnel  Management for human capital efforts.  The administration has identified acquisition workforce development as a  pillar for improving acquisition practices and contract performance. While  I fully agree with this goal, we need  specific and concrete action to solve  this problem.  Our  legislation would prompt  the  sustained effort necessary to rebuild  the acquisition workforce. While this  will take time and investment, I am  confident  this  is a wise  investment  that will yield  substantial  returns.  Just  think about  it:  if our better-  trained acquisition professionals can  prevent one failed procurement, it can  save the taxpayer hundreds of millions  of dollars. If they can avoid overpaying  one percent of our contract spending, it  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:27 May 09, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S07AP1.REC S07AP1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011
680,187,2011-04-07,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, in today’s rapidly changing, global knowledge-based economy, making sure that  all students graduate from high school  is more important than ever. A high  school diploma opens the doors to postsecondary education and workforce development programs, which  lead  to  jobs that pay family-sustaining wages.  The bottom line is that a high school  diploma is no longer an option—it is an  essential education credential that all  Americans need to have  in order to  successfully compete in the workforce.  Yet, for far too many, a high school diploma is still out of reach. According  to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, one out of every three students  who enters the ninth grade  fails to  graduate  from high school within 4  years. An estimated 12 million students  will drop out of school during the next  decade, costing the Nation more than  $3 trillion in forgone revenues and increased social service costs.  When Congress passed the No Child  Left Behind Act in 2001, we required  that accountability determinations for  high schools include graduation rates.  However,  the  law  did  not  require  States to use a common formula for  calculating graduation rates nor did it  set  graduation  rate  goals  for high  schools.

700,201,2011-04-07,Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to promote  increased awareness  about patient safety and a higher quality of  health care in our country. According to the  1999 Institute of Medicine report, more than  98,000 patients die annually from medical errors  that  occur  in  the  hospital.  The  HealthGrades analysis of patient safety published in 2009 stated that almost 100,000 preventable deaths occurred annually in Medicare  patients from 2005 to 2007. Based on these  findings, patient safety has not improved in almost a decade.  All of us have either been patients or know  someone who has been a patient, and we expect our loved ones to receive excellent patient care. Recently, I had the opportunity to  meet with a nurse  from Vancouver, Washington, who shared the touching story regarding  the death of her  father. Kristi Victoria  Goodwin  told me about her  father Kenneth  Edgar Anderson, who died from multiple preventable medical errors.  Mr. Anderson, a 55 year old, went  to his  doctor after experiencing chest pains while  riding his bicycle. The doctor ordered cardiac  testing, but, unfortunately, Mr. Anderson was  never notified that his cardiac tests were abnormal. Based on his cardiac tests, Mr. Anderson should have received a cardiology consult, further cardiac testing, and based on his  autopsy results, he would have been a candidate for open heart surgery. Instead, almost  three months after his cardiac workup was  completed, Mr. Anderson died  from sudden  cardiac death while riding his bicycle.  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking  Kristi for coming to D.C. to share this personal  story to illustrate the importance of the issue  of patient safety. I also ask that you join me  in promoting patient safety and improving the  quality of health care in this country.  TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL  PHILIP M. RUHLMAN  IN MEMORY OF ELIZABETH  ‘‘MOTHER LIZ’’ ANN SAMUELS  HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO  OFGUAM  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 7, 2011  ",2011
701,201,2011-04-07,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and pay  tribute  to Brigadier General  Philip M. Ruhlman for 31 years of service and  dedication to the United States Air Force. He  currently serves as the Director of Manpower,  Organization and Resources  in Washington,  D.C., and will retire from active duty on May  1, 2011. He will be missed by many.  Brigadier General Ruhlman graduated from  the U.S. Air Force Academy  in 1980, and  earned his wings  the  following year. He received his first assignment as a jump-qualified  battalion air liaison officer and forward air controller,  flying  the  O–2A  Skymaster.  He  transitioned to the F–16 Fighting Falcon, and  has since flown every version assigned to the  Air Force. In 1987, he earned a master’s degree in Aeronautical Science from Embry-Riddle  Aeronautical University. He  has  also  served as a National Defense Fellow and Air  Force Fellow for the National Defense University, and as a Senior Executive Fellow for the  John F. Kennedy School of Government at  Harvard University.  A command pilot with more than 3,200 flight  hours, Brigadier General Ruhlman has led a  fighter squadron, fighter operations group, and  two wings—including  the  largest operational  F–16 fighter wing in the Air Force. He flew 43  F–16 combat missions over Iraq and Kuwait  during Operation Desert Storm, and served as  a wing weapons officer,  instructor pilot, and  Chief of Standardization and Evaluation. His  staff assignments include joint element, major  command, direct reporting unit, Air Staff and  NATO levels serving at home and abroad.  Throughout his career, Brigadier General  Ruhlman’s exemplary service earned him numerous awards and military decorations. During his command of the 36th Wing on Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, he was  instrumental  in  resolving  road access  issues  for  landlocked properties contiguous to the base.  His efforts  to  find solutions  to  these  issues  demonstrated his commitment to building and  maintaining a positive relationship between the  civilian and military communities. In addition, I  wish  to  recognize  Brigadier  General  Ruhlman’s efforts  in  implementing  the Joint  Region Marianas—a collaboration between the  Air Force and the U.S. Navy that provides installation support  for all components of  the  Department of the Defense on Guam and in  the Northern Mariana Islands. Brigadier General Ruhlman was always a staunch advocate  for Guam and understood the need for greater  collaboration with  the  local government  to  make the military build-up a success. His efforts were successful, in great part, because  of  the  leadership and guidance  that he  received from leaders in the Air Force like retired General Howie Chandler.  Mr. Speaker, Brigadier General Ruhlman  distinguished himself as an exceptional leader  during his career with the U.S. Air Force. His  commitment and dedication will be  remembered for many years to come. I trust my fellow members of  the House will  join me  in  wishing the very best to General Ruhlman, his  wife Lina, and son, Alex on  their  future endeavors.  HON.

702,201,2011-04-07,Mr. ELLISON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  mourn the passing of Civil rights activist, leader, and community advocate Elizabeth Ann  Samuels. Elizabeth Samuels was known by  those in the community of North Minneapolis  as ‘‘Mother Liz’’ for her nurturing and strong  demeanor and as a champion of human and  civil rights.  A  longtime  resident of North Minneapolis,  Mother Liz graduated from North High School  and attended Augsburg College. Mother Liz  served  her  neighborhood  and  the African  American community in a number of key civic  posts. For example, she spent many years as  Director of the American Red Cross in North  Minneapolis and also worked for the Coalition  of Black Churches,  the African American  Leadership  Summit,  and  the  Willard  Homewood Organization.  Mother Liz was deeply dedicated  to her  friends,  family, and community and  touched  the  lives of many people  through her work,  volunteering, and care-giving. I ask that we remember the spirit and passion for equality and  peace  that Mother Liz helped shape  in  the  Minneapolis community.  f  IN  RECOGNITION  OF  KATHLEEN  COLLINS,  PRESIDENT  OF  THE  KANSAS CITY ART INSTITUTE  HON.

703,201,2011-04-07,Mr. CLEAVER.," Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise  today in recognizing the outstanding achievements and cultural legacy nurtured at the Kansas City Art  Institute by  retiring President,  Kathleen Collins. She took over the duties as  President in 1996 and through the years has  built strong community partnerships  that  resulted in creative and innovative projects. Her  efforts enhanced and modernized the quality  and function of the Kansas City Art Institute  into providing an education in creativity, professionalism and business practices.  The Kansas City Art Institute dates back to  1885  to a group of artists who  referred  to  themselves as the Sketch Club. Walt Disney,  Thomas Hart Benton, Robert Rauschenberg  and Robert Morris have all been associated  with the Institute. Two of Kansas City’s most  well known businessmen, J.C. Nichols and  William T. Kemper, Jr., served on the Board of  Trustees. Today, the Kansas City Art Institute  is an  integral part of  the cultural growth of  Kansas City and continues to sustain the support of the community.  Under Kathleen Collins’  leadership, enrollment escalated and  the  Institute expanded,  with over $25 million in renovations and improvements  on  campus.

Father Coughlin, from Chicago, has  been ordained  for 50 years, and has  found time to be an angel to the poor  in Calcutta, India, where he lived with  members of Mother Teresa’s community.

712,8,2011-04-15,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Chairman, there  is one proposed budget that ends the  war in Afghanistan, cuts Cold War-era  weapons  systems,  completely  eliminates the deficit within 10 years and  aligns the Tax Code with the values of  working families. And that’s the people’s budget submitted by the Congressional Progressive Caucus.  Instead of taking away health care  from seniors by gutting Medicare, the  people’s budget provides more affordable health care with a robust public  option that would save this Nation’s  taxpayers $68 billion over 7 years.  The majority’s  budget  will  cost  Americans 1.7 million  jobs over the  next 3 years. Our budget puts America  back to work with badly needed investments  in  transportation,  infrastructure, and a 21st-century education system.  We have a choice. The majority budget which demands more sacrifice from  struggling  families  and  gives  the  wealthy a free ride; or the progressive  budget which invests in people, creates  a budget surplus, and brings our troops  home.  I urge my colleagues, make a smart,  fiscally responsible choice. Vote for the  people’s budget.  ",2011

714,8,2011-04-15,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," I appreciate the  chairman for yielding to me, and I appreciate the opportunity to stand and  speak against the Progressive Caucus  budget because it is a budget that, once  again, will spend too much money.  Mr. Chairman, one of the things that  we have heard from the American people is this: they are tired of the Federal  Government spending taxpayer money  for  programs  they  don’t want  and  spending money that they don’t have.  And it is time for us to put this fiscal  house in order.  Now, quite  frankly,  I  think  that  today is a really great day. When we  get to the end of this legislative day  and the end of this legislative week, we  will have passed  the Ryan budget,  which turns an enormous corner  for  our Nation. Over the next 10 years, it  will reduce spending not by millions  and billions, but by trillions—$6.2 trillion over the next 10 years.  Those are the kinds of  first steps  that the American people are wanting  to see. That’s the kind of fiscal responsibility that the American people are  holding us accountable for: controlling  spending, limiting spending, and making certain that there is a stable and  secure environment in which economic  growth and job creation can take place.  They have spoken loudly and clearly.  And they have said reduce what you  are spending, get your fiscal house in  order, begin to focus not on the next 6  weeks or 6 months but the next 60  years, and focus on our children and  our grandchildren, making certain that  we are not tapping their futures and  trading it to the nations that hold our  debt. I think that  it’s so  important  that we begin to arrest this and get it  under control and to pass the Ryan  budget today.  ",2011

But the  infrastructure needs of our country,  over $3 trillion—according to the Society of Engineers, says that we need $3  trillion in infrastructure spending.  Let’s do something and put America  back to work by rebuilding our Nation’s infrastructure.  ",2011

719,8,2011-04-15,Ms. LEE.," Let me thank our cochairs,  Congressmen ELLISON and GRIJALVA,  for their tremendous leadership.  Budgets are not  just dollars and  cents. They are moral documents that  reflect who we are and what we believe  in. The Republican budget is an assault  on women,  seniors,  the underserved  poor and  low-income  families. It’s a  shameless  attempt  to  finance  tax  breaks for millionaires on the backs of  the most  vulnerable.  The  people’s  budget, however, offers a commonsense  fiscally responsible plan that protects  critical programs and  services  that  millions of Americans depends on.  Our plan would eliminate the deficit  in the next decade, put people back to  work, and restore our economic competitiveness. In these difficult times, it  includes additional funding for unemployment  insurance  to  help  those  who’ve maxed out at 99 weeks to get  additional benefits, recognizing there  are five people to one job.  Our  proposal  eliminates  the  true  drivers of our deficit, the unpaid-for  Bush tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and  Afghanistan, and it restates the law  that no permanent bases will be built  in Iraq. And we protect and preserve  Medicare and Social Security for the  future, and it includes a public option  which saves money. The people’s budget invests in our people, in our communities, and in our Nation.  I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.  ",2011
720,8,2011-04-15,Mr. ROKITA.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself 10 seconds.  There has been a lot of talk about  budgets being moral instruments. The  budget  that we’ve proposed  through  the Budget Committee, the Ryan budget, is a responsible budget. And let me  say, Mr. Chairman, what is immoral is  balancing these choices on the backs of  our children and grandchildren, Americans who haven’t even been born yet.  That’s what’s immoral.  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. MULVANEY).  ",2011
721,8,2011-04-15,Mr. MULVANEY.," I thank Mr. ROKITA  for the time.  I want to applaud my colleagues in  the Progressive Caucus for doing something which I think is intellectually  honest. In fact, I think if you look at a  couple of budgets that we’re going to  be looking at over the next 2 days, the  budget that the Budget Committee has  offered, I think is a fair and honest representation of where the Republican  Party is. The Republican Study Committee budget that we’ll see in just a  few minutes is a fair and honest representation of where the Republican  Study Committee  stands. And  this  budget, I think, is offered as a true and  honest position, a policy statement, of  where the progressives in this body and  in this country stand. And for that I  thank them.  That being said, it’s hard to imagine  a document that is more different from  our document. There are $16 trillion  worth of tax increases in this document. To the extent that the progressives do stand and are honest in their  belief that taxing and spending is the  way to fix the Nation, this document  certainly does contain that.  All of the 2001, 2003 tax cuts, which  we affectionately refer to around here  as the Bush tax cuts, are gone, not just  the ones on the highest income earners, everybody. This is a tax increase  on almost everybody. In fact, it is a tax  increase on everybody in the entire Nation. The top marginal rates under this  proposal go from 45 percent up to 49  percent. The capital gains rate goes up  to as high as 49 percent.  We introduced a new concept in this  budget, apparently,  the progressives  do, that takes the estate tax to a progressive model, where you get estate  tax rates that range from 45 percent up  to 65 percent. We heard a few minutes  ago, my colleague, Mr. LANKFORD, talk  about the fact that there’s a 25-cent  gas tax increase in this particular document.  This is an avalanche of new taxes. At  every single turn, the motivation behind the progressives seems to be that  the government needs more money,  that  the  government  needs more  money and it is our obligation to give  it to the government. And we simply,  wholeheartedly, dismiss that idea.  But, again, I think it is nice for a  change to have honest and open debate  on an intellectual basis in this Chamber. I thank the progressives  for at  least laying out where they stand. And  I  think  it’s a good process  to go  through. I think we’ll have a chance  later on today in just a few minutes to  see where we stand as a Nation, at  least as a body, here on these types of  changes.  I very much hope that this amendment is defeated. I think that the Republican  Budget  Committee  alternative is a better course of action. And  I would like to see this amendment defeated.  ",2011

",2011
724,22,2011-04-15,Mr. FLAKE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  I rise in support of the RSC budget.  With a deficit of $1.6 trillion, a debt of  $14 trillion, it’s no surprise that we’ve  got to do something. We have to do  something dramatic. This budget actually balances over a 9-year period, and  it reforms the programs that are important to many Americans, to make  them  solvent  and  sustainable  over  time.  The proposals from the other side of  the aisle simply don’t do that. They ignore the time bomb that we have in  these programs. So I commend the RSC  staff and Members for putting this together. This is a good budget. We ought  to support it to put our Nation on a  path of financial stability and security.  ",2011
725,22,2011-04-15,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Chairman,  the time bomb that’s ticking is the  time bomb on the Medicare guarantee.  With that, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. WAXMAN), the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.  ",2011
726,22,2011-04-15,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I can’t  express my concern with greater alarm  about this budget. It is a budget that’s  going to inflict terrible harm on Americans from all walks of life, while protecting  the wealthiest  taxpayers  in  America, both individuals and Republicans.  Now, if I give the benefit of the doubt  to the Republican sponsors of their  budget proposal that they’re sincere,  they are speaking from an ideological  point of view, they want to try a social  experiment in this country. But if they  fail to live up to what they say they’re  going to accomplish, there is going to  be tremendous harm.  We have a social contract with seniors to provide affordable, accessible,  comprehensive health care under Medicare. And they want to take Medicare  and end it, and tell those people to go  to private  insurance companies. We  have estimates that the average senior  will face cost increases of $6,000 when  the program begins, and it could be  over $11,000 per beneficiary  in  later  years. But right away, to add insult to  injury, they would reopen the doughnut hole under the part D prescription  drug benefit, meaning people still have  to pay all of the cost of their drugs, reversing what the Affordable Care Act  provided.  But most of their cuts are coming  from the Medicaid program. They want  to take Medicaid and turn it into a  block grant. Medicaid accounts for 43  percent of total long-term care spending in the U.S. Most of it goes to seniors and disabled people who are  in  nursing homes. If the States don’t have  enough money in their block grants,  are they going to dump these people?  These are human beings, and you are  playing with their lives. This means  real harm will be inflicted where Medicaid spending is the greatest.  By  cutting  reimbursement  rates,  Medicaid will lose providers. Nursing  home quality and staffing levels will  decline.  Reject this budget. Don’t experiment  on the most vulnerable of our population.  Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose the Republican  Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2012. Their  budget inflicts terrible harm on Americans from  all walks of life—while protecting the wealthiest taxpayers in America, both individuals and  corporations.  I am particularly disturbed by what the Republican budget does to Medicare and Medicaid.  There is no other way to put it: the Republican budget  is  the end of Medicare as we  know  it, and  it  is devastating  for Medicare  beneficiaries.  Medicare is a social contract with our seniors  to provide affordable, accessible, comprehensive health care. The Republicans want  to turn Medicare over to the private insurance  industry, with payments to seniors that will fall  far short of what they need to get the health  care they deserve.  The Congressional Budget Office analysis of  the Republican budget shows  that, over  the  next decade, it will more than double beneficiary cost for new enrollees.  The average senior will face increased costs  of over $6,000 annually when the program begins. And all of that extra spending by seniors  and people with disabilities will go to private  health insurance plans.  The transfer of seniors into private plans will  raise costs by over $11,000 per beneficiary by  2030.  To add insult to injury, the Republican budget reopens the donut hole under the Part D  prescription drug benefit,  increasing  the burden on seniors starting today.  For Medicaid,  the Republican budget  is  even worse. Medicaid covers 60 million of the  country’s most vulnerable people, one in 3 low  income children, 5 million seniors, and 10 million disabled individuals.  It accounts for 43 percent of total long term  care spending in the U.S.  But the Republican budget cuts Medicaid in  half by 2022, and turns it into a block grant for  the states right away.  job  in  the  losses  rates, Medicaid  And since the Medicaid block grant would  grow by only 1 percent per year, while inflation  is over 2 percent and health inflation and enrollment growth is even higher.  This means real harm will be inflicted where  Medicaid spending is the greatest: on seniors  and  individuals with  disabilities  in  nursing  homes and  those  receiving benefits  to  live  independently in their home.  By cutting  reimbursement  will lose health providers.  Nursing home quality and staffing levels will  inevitably decline.  Medicaid cuts will mean  health professions.  The Republican budget utterly fails the basic  test of humane government. It is extreme, it is  mean, and it must be defeated.  ",2011
727,22,2011-04-15,Mr. GARRETT.," Mr. Chair, I yield 1  minute to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN), who does not  believe it’s a social experiment to do  what all families have to do: live within our means.  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr.  Chairman, folks, no prepared remarks,  no fancy speeches. I brought with me a  financial calculator. And regardless of  how you calculate the numbers, America is spending too much money.  You know, for 3 years in a row we  spent over a trillion dollars more than  we were bringing in as a Nation. We are  over $14 trillion in debt. This budget  puts us on a very clear path to paying  back the national debt, to reducing and  ending deficits in a very timely manner, to protecting the future for our  children and our grandchildren, our  most precious resource as Americans.  I urge my colleagues to get behind  this budget, vote for it, and let’s put  the American  spending  in  priority.  Let’s stop the spending insanity here  in Washington, D.C., and let’s do what  we tell the folks back home we are  going to do, and let’s get our fiscal  house in order.  ",2011
728,22,2011-04-15,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," We can get our  fiscal house in order and do this in a  balanced way without ending the Medicare guarantee.  With that, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman  from  New  York  (Mr.  ISRAEL).  ",2011
729,22,2011-04-15,Mr. ISRAEL.," I thank my friend from  Maryland for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, every budget is about  the bottom line, and here is the Ryan  budget bottom line: If you are making  over  a million  dollars,  you  get  a  $100,000 tax cut. If you are a senior on  Medicare, you get an extra $12,000 medical bill. If you make over a million  dollars, you win the lottery. If you are  a senior citizen, you lose your Medicare.  Mr. Chairman, they say this is about  balancing the budget, but they are trying to balance the budget by giving tax  cuts to people earning over a million  dollars and taking Medicare away from  our seniors. That is no way to balance  the budget.  ",2011

736,36,2011-04-15,Mr.  MULVANEY.,  ,2011
737,36,2011-04-15,Mr. MULVANEY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  would like to start by thanking my  own chairman, Mr. RYAN, and also the  ranking member, Mr. VANHOLLEN, for  the entire process. It has been my first  year. I have enjoyed it. We’ve had some  spirited debates. I know that we have  disagreed more than we agree, but I  have appreciated the opportunity to do  this.  I’ll close with this. This will be the  last opportunity I’ll have to speak on  this year’s budget. We’ve heard a lot  about the benefits that accrued to this  Nation during the Clinton administration. I for one am willing to give partial credit to the President at that  time.  It was a Democrat President.  Yes, it was. It was a House of Representatives controlled by my party.  And  I think  it was a  formula that  worked for the Nation.  We’ve heard a lot of things, though,  about the importance of raising the tax  rates back to the Clinton era in order  to solve our problems. I would suggest  to you it was not the tax rates during  the Clinton era that drove our prosperity at the time.  Let me  show you what President  Clinton did to the size of the government workforce. President Clinton was  elected right about here. There was a  dramatic reduction in the size of the  Federal workforce, a dramatic reduction in the size of Federal spending on  people who work for the Federal Government. In fact, unprecedented in the  last 30 years, done again under a Democrat President and a Republican House.  What happened as a result? As spending as a percentage of our economy  went down,  the unemployment  rate  went down. As the government spent  less, more people went back to work.  As we sit here, we all agree that the  discussion is really about jobs. There’s  nothing more telling than what happened during the Clinton administration as a formula for how to create  jobs—the government needs to spend  less.  My question  to my esteemed colleagues on this side of the aisle  is,  where is this type of leadership out of  the White House these days? Where is  this generation’s Bill Clinton saying  let’s spend less on government spending so that people go back to work? If  we put President Obama’s proposals,  his current budget, up here, it would be  almost the exact opposite of what your  party  proposed  only  20  years  ago.  Where is that type of leadership out of  the White House?  ",2011
738,36,2011-04-15,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to a distinguished member of the Budget Committee, Mr. GARRETTof New Jersey.  ",2011
739,36,2011-04-15,Mr. GARRETT.,"  I  thank  the gentleman.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Democrat substitute amendment.  Let me just quickly here sum up. The  Democrats’ prescription,  if you will,  for our Nation’s fiscal troubles basically  includes what? More spending,  more debt and more taxes, more taxes  on hardworking  families  and  small  businesses. And so while the Democrat  budget has lower deficits than, well,  the President’s budget, you really need  to take a closer  look at how they  achieve this and how they achieve the  deficit  reduction  compared  to  the  White House’s budget.  Let’s take a look at it. First, well,  they raise taxes again. How much? By  $208 billion more than the President’s  budget on all Americans. Then what do  they do next? They cut the defense  budget. By how much? By $614 billion  again relative to the President’s budget over the 10-year window. Now, at the  same time, you already had Secretary  Gates who has said that we need to cut  the Defense budget by $78 billion. They  want to cut Defense by $614 billion on  top of that.  What about in addition to that? Well,  in their budget, if you go into it and  look, there’s about $400 billion in unspecified savings. Unspecified? Here at  the 12th hour they still can’t decide  how they want to try to rein in spending? Of course not, because they really  honestly don’t want to do so.  I believe that budgets must be credible, and the Democrats’ budget doesn’t  pass that test at all. The only specific  savings in the budget come from how?  Raising taxes again on Americans and  cutting the defense budget. The Democrat budget does not tackle even the  drivers behind our deficits. What are  they? It does not address the pending  bankruptcy—yes, bankruptcy—of Medicare  and Medicaid.  The Democrat  budget is nothing more than punting,  which is exactly what the administration and the White House have been  doing as well.  Now, look, the American people want  Congress to do the right thing. The  American people want us to get spending, want us to get deficits, and they  want us to get our debt here in Washington under control, just as American  families have to get their spending,  deficit and debt under control, just as  small businesses across this country  have  to get  it under  control. The  Democrats’ budget is frankly an embarrassment and shows that the other  side is not serious about taking our fiscal challenges seriously.  ",2011
740,36,2011-04-15,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," I yield myself 45  seconds.  What we heard just doesn’t fit the  facts. In fact, our budget does make  cuts to domestic programs, but we do  not do it in a meat ax way. We make  cuts to agriculture subsidies. We do tax  reform  as  the  commission  recommended, getting rid of a lot of clutter in the Tax Code for special interests. That is what we do.  With respect to defense, our numbers  track what the President was saying  the other day, but we do get rid of a so-  called overseas contingency fund which  we think our Republican friends would  like to join us on which gives the executive branch a blank check to undertake any military operations whatsoever for the next 10 years and doesn’t  have to ask Congress. That’s what we  do.  What we don’t do? We don’t end the  Medicare guarantee. What we don’t do  is we don’t keep giving subsidies to oil  companies while we cut education for  kids. That’s what we don’t do.  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of  my  time  to  the very distinguished  Democratic leader, ",2011

I  commend him and the members of the  Budget Committee for their hard work  to bring legislation to the floor to enable us to have this debate yesterday  and today and I think for a long time  to come.  We have said it over and over again:  A Federal budget should be a statement of our national values. It should  reflect what is important to us as we  allocate the resources of investments  for the  future. Much has been said  about this deficit, and I want to join  the distinguished ranking member before I go any further in correcting the  record.  I  listened with  great  interest  as  Members on the other side are taking  credit for the Clinton administration  balanced, or budgets in surplus. And I  remind  them or  tell  them, because  many of them may not know, that  those budgets were a result of the 1993  budget vote that we took on this floor  of the House without one Republican  vote which was the source of that fiscal  discipline and job creation, again, as  other speakers have said, over 20 million jobs created.  So when I hear the Republicans say  it was the Clinton Presidency and the  Republican Congress, no,  it was the  Democratic Congress, because we know  that deficit reduction is essential. We  had to stop the budget deficits that  President Clinton inherited, and now  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:16 Apr 16, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K15AP7.051 H15APPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

753,64,2011-04-15,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Mr. Chair, my Republican  colleagues have introduced a bill to end Medicare as we know it in order to pay for tax giveaways  to millionaires and profitable companies.  Listening to the President’s speech yesterday, and to my colleagues on the floor today,  I’m convinced that this debate is about no less  than the values we hold as Americans. As the  President said, the Republican budget is less  about  reducing  the deficit  than  it  is about  changing the basic social compact in America.  Do we want to live in an America where opportunity is snatched away from young people  who want an education, or one where any student who works hard enough can find a way  to succeed?  Do we want to live in an America where our  seniors can retire with dignity after a lifetime of  hard work, or one where the elderly must ask  their children for the spare room they might  not even have to give?  Much of what the President has proposed  has yet to be fleshed out in detail, and I hope  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:26 Apr 16, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15AP8.008 E15APPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

I am happy  to announce  that Nathan Kruse, of Ottawa, Ohio has been  offered an appointment  to attend  the United  States  Air  Force  Academy  in  Colorado  Springs, Colorado.  Nathan brings an enormous amount of leadership, service and dedication to the incoming  class of Air Force cadets. While a gifted athlete, having earned varsity and junior varsity  letters in football and track, Nathan has also  maintained  the highest standards of excellence  in his academics. He attained a 4.0  GPA at Ottawa-Glandorf High School and is a  member of and president of  the National  Honor Society. Nathan also participated in the  German Club,  Academic Quiz  Bowl  and  Science Olympiad.  Outside the classroom, Nathan is an Eagle  Scout, Junior Optimist Club member and has  volunteered  for numerous  tutoring opportunities. Nathan’s dedication and service  to his  community and his peers has proven his ability to excel among the leaders at the Air Force  Academy.  I have no doubt  that Nathan will  take the lessons of his student leadership with  him to Colorado Springs.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating Nathan Kruse on his acceptance of appointment to the United States Air  Force Academy where he will gain a world-  class education and receive invaluable leadership experience. I am positive that Nathan will  excel during his career at the Air Force Academy, and I ask my colleagues to join me in  extending their best wishes to him as he begins his service to the nation.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE PERSONALIZE YOUR CARE ACT OF 2011  HON. EARL BLUMENAUER  OFOREGON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 15, 2011  ",2011
755,71,2011-04-15,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  am proud  to  introduce  the Personalize Your  Care Act of 2011.  Advances in healthcare have led to increasingly complex health care decisions and more  treatment options  than we have ever before  had the benefit—or the burden—of choosing  between. Both Democrats and Republicans  agree that individuals should be fully involved  in decisions related to their own health care  and should be able  to make  informed decisions about  that care reflecting  their values  and  their needs. We also agree  that when  people have expressed their wishes, particularly in a formal and legally binding manner,  those wishes should be known and respected.  While  there  is widespread agreement  regarding these principles, too often this is not  the reality. Most adults have not completed an  advance directive;  if documents are  completed, they are not regularly revisited and can  be difficult to locate. Because these issues are  difficult to discuss, surrogates often feel ill-prepared  to  interpret  their  loved ones’ written  wishes.  These shortcomings can leave families and  healthcare proxies  faced with  the burden of  determining  their  loved ones’ wishes  in  the  midst of crisis, sometimes with little or no information about how best to direct care. This  adds not only stress and anxiety to an already  difficult situation, but studies show that lack of  advance care planning actually prolongs  the  grieving process after losing a loved one.  One of  the greatest misconceptions about  advance care planning is that it is a one-time  event. Attempting to plan for all possibilities in  a single document or within a single conversation is overwhelming and, quite likely, impossible. Where possible, this should be an ongoing conversation. Careful, early advance care  planning is important because a person’s ability to make decisions may diminish over time  and he or she may suddenly lose the capability to participate in his or her health care decisions.  Successful advance care planning  is  less  about legal documentation and more about facilitating ongoing communication about future  care wishes among  individuals,  their health  care providers, and surrogates. This approach  recognizes that advance care documents like  advance directives are not the ‘‘ends,’’ but the  ‘‘means’’—they are the tools for documenting  care preferences based on informed decisions  that  incorporate an  individual’s values, personal goals, and current circumstances.  This process not only provides higher quality care, but personalized care.  The Personalize Your Care Act aims to support advance care planning by providing Medicare andMedicaid coverage for voluntary consultations about advance care planning every  5 years or in the event of a change in health  status. This periodic revisiting of advance care  documents and goals of care recognizes that  an  individual’s preferences can change over  time. It also recognizes that the advance care  plan should be updated if an individual develops a serious or chronic illness, if additional  curative and palliative  treatment options become available, and to consistently reflect the  individual’s current circumstances and preferences.  Honoring  the expressed wishes of  individuals must also be a priority. For this to occur,  advance care planning documents must be  accessible wherever care is provided. The legislation ensures that an individual’s electronic  health record is able to display his or her current advance directive and/or physician orders  for life sustaining treatment (POLST), so that  his or her wishes are easily accessible and respected. Furthermore, under  the  legislation,  advance directives would be portable, ensuring that advance directives completed in one  the  state are honored  in another state,  in  event care needed to be provided there.  The  legislation  also  provides  grants  to  states to establish or expand physician orders  for life sustaining treatment programs. These  programs have a track record of promoting patient autonomy through documenting and coordinating a person’s  treatment preferences,  clarifying treatment intentions and minimizing  confusion, reducing repetitive activities in complying with the Patient Self Determination Act,  and facilitating appropriate treatment by emergency personnel.  These  investments  in advance care planning will reinforce patient-centered care—engaging  individuals  in planning and decision-  making about their future care and ensuring  that  those preferences are documented, accessible, and can be honored in any state and  in any care setting.  I am proud  to  introduce  the Personalize  Your Care Act with the support of patient advocates, physicians, nurses, and  the  faith  community who see every day how advance  care planning improves individuals’ and families’ peace of mind and  the quality of  their  care.  f  TERRORIST ATTACKS ON ISRAELIS  MARK NEW ESCALATION  HON. TOM REED  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 15, 2011  ",2011
756,71,2011-04-15,Mr. REED.," Mr. Speaker, the recent bombing  in Jerusalem and sharp  rise  in unprovoked  rocket attacks from Gaza have marked an escalation in violence by the Palestinian terrorists backed by Hamas and Iran. These attacks  are a stark  reminder of  the constant  threat  Israel faces from those who want to destroy  the Israeli state. It is also a reminder that the  friendship and partnership  the United States  has with Israel is one that must always be protected and enhanced. Israel must be able to  count on the continued support of the United  States and the American people as they endeavor to live in a democracy free from the  threat of attack.  In just the first 3 months of 2011, terrorists  have fired more than 150 mortars and rockets  into Israel and murdered five members of an  Israeli family in their West Bank home. More  frightening, Israeli forces intercepted 50 tons  of Iranian arms, including advanced anti-ship  missiles and radar, 2,500 mortar rounds, and  67,000 AK–47 rounds destined for Hamas in  Gaza. The acquisition of these kinds of weapons makes it clear that Palestinian terrorists  do not intend to back down from their campaign of terror.  This violence against  the  Israeli people  is  aided by  the  tacit compliance of  the Palestinian  Authority, which  thus  far  has  not  stepped up its anti-terrorism efforts to root out  Hamas and other terrorist elements associated  with the Fatah Party. Instead, the Palestinians  are generally accepting of this continued violence, martyring those who kill innocent civilians. Recently,  the  terrorist Dalal Mughrabi,  who killed 35  Israelis after hijacking a bus,  had a town square named in his honor. This  behavior—and general popular acceptance of  terror—only encourages further violence.  We cannot allow this escalated level of violence to be dismissed as just more back and  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:26 Apr 16, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K15AP8.008 E15APPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011
757,78,2011-04-15,Mr. GRIJALVA.," Mr. Speaker, I am honored  to recognize former United States Army Combat Medic and current University of Arizona  student Matt Randle.  Over the course of his career in the Army,  Matt received two Army Commendation Medals, three Army Achievement Medals and two  Good Conduct Medals for his service.  Following his distinguished service  to our  country Matt returned to his hometown of Tucson, Arizona and enrolled at the University of  Arizona. Once on the UA campus, Matt began  working with UA President Robert Shelton and  his staff to develop and implement a program  to support  returning veterans attending  the  University. I am proud to say that today the  University of Arizona, located in my Congressional district, has one of the most progressive  and impressive veteran education and service  models in the country including a student run  veteran’s office.  Matt’s leadership has also played an integral role in the prosperity of the UA Veterans  club. This club received numerous awards on  the University of Arizona’s campus  including  the Club of the Year and Philanthropic Group  of  the Year  for  the 2009–2010 academic  school year. The Student Veterans of America  also recognized the club nationally, awarding it  the ‘‘Club of the Year Award.’’  This year Matt will receive the UA’s 2011  Robie Award. The award is issued to students  who show personal  integrity,  initiative, cooperativeness, enthusiasm, humility, patriotism,  well-rounded  interests, active participation  in  student affairs and a commitment to service.  Matt Randle  is a model candidate  for  this  award.  Matt Randle’s ambition and leadership both  at the UA and nationally will certainly be of  great benefit to our returning veterans. Every  day more veterans return home from the Middle East conflicts. The programs that Matt built  on the University of Arizona campus support  these men and women as they transition back  to civilian life.  Upon graduation Matt will be attending the  University Of Arizona Rogers College of Law  in the fall of 2011.  I am pleased to acknowledge my constituent  and friend, Matt Randle. I thank him for his  leadership, service and outstanding contributions to the University and our community.  f  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND  FULL-YEAR CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2011  SPEECHOF  HON. KAY GRANGER  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 14, 2011  ",2011
758,78,2011-04-15,Ms. GRANGER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  this Continuing Resolution. We must  pass this bill today to begin to get this Nation  on a path of fiscal stability. I want to make a  few brief remarks about the State-Foreign Operations  title of  the bill. State-Foreign Operations is reduced by 8.4 billion dollars from the  fiscal year 2011 request. While some of my  colleagues might  say  these  funding  levels  mean that diplomacy and development take a  large reduction, we need to keep in mind that  the State-Foreign Operations  bill  grew  by  more than 33% from FY08 to FY10. We simply cannot allow these programs to continue to  grow at this rate. The reductions taken in this  bill are  targeted, so  that we can remain  focused on our highest national security priorities. The bill provides critical  funds  for  the  frontline States of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. It supports security assistance to some  of our strongest allies—like  Israel, Jordan,  Mexico, and Colombia. It also addresses unexpected  humanitarian  crises  around  the  world. I want to thank my colleague, Ranking  Member Lowey,  for working with me  to address these high priority needs. I know we will  continue to work together to address problems  of bipartisan concern.  f  IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF ASHTON GENZMAN ON HER OFFER  OF APPOINTMENT  TO ATTEND  THE  UNITED  STATES  NAVAL  ACADEMY  HON.

I am happy  to announce  that Ashton Genzman of Perrysburg, Ohio has  been offered an appointment  to attend  the  United States Naval Academy  in Annapolis,  Maryland.  Ashton brings an enormous amount of leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming  Class of 2015. She has served  in several  leadership roles: student government, Junior  Induction Committee, Culinary Club and in a  variety of other groups and extracurricular activities. While attending Notre Dame Academy  in Toledo, Ohio, Ashton consistently achieved  high honors, with an exceptional grade point  average.  Throughout high school, Ashton participated  in a number of athletic activities, including tennis, in which she received a varsity letter. She  has also been involved in crew and track and  field. I am confident that Ashton will carry the  lessons of her student and athletic leadership  to the United States Naval Academy.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating Ashton Genzman on the acceptance of her appointment  to  the United  States Naval Academy  in Annapolis, where  she will gain a world-class education and invaluable leadership experience. I am positive  that Ashton will excel during her career at the  United States Naval Academy, and I ask my  colleagues to join me in extending their best  wishes to her as she begins her service to the  nation.

TAMMYBALDWIN, BRIANBILBRAY, SUSAN  DAVIS, PETER DEFAZIO, BOB FILNER,  JOHN  GARAMENDI, ALGREEN, SHEILA JACKSONLEE,  KURTSCHRADER, GREGWALDEN, DAVIDWU,  and DONYOUNG. Together we represent each  of the states that would benefit from an expansion of the Qualified Veterans Mortgage Bond  program.  This program was originally created after  World War  II  to  promote  homeownership  among our  returning  troops. Together, our  states offer veterans mortgage loans at more  favorable interest rates as a reward for their  service to our Nation. As part of a comprehensive review of veterans’ services in the state  of Oregon,  the Oregon Governor’s Veterans  Task Force recommended a further expansion  of this highly effective program.  This Act is based on one particularly timely  recommendation  to expand eligibility  for our  state programs and bring affordable mortgages  to an additional 264,000 veterans.  I  look forward to continuing to work on behalf of  Oregon and  the nation’s veterans  to ensure  that we provide  the best possible quality of  care and service, and so that we can make  this a true lifetime benefit for all qualified veterans.  f  96TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  ARMENIAN GENOCIDE  HON.

761,78,2011-04-15,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to  submit for the record these remarks I gave at  a Capitol Hill ceremony commemorating  the  96th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.  Tonight we commemorate a truly unjust and  tragic chapter in human history—and just as  importantly, we acknowledge that chapter as  an historic fact. From 1915 to 1923, officials of  the Ottoman Empire carried out a systematic  campaign of massacres and  forced deportations of Armenians from their historic homeland. In the end, this genocide cost the lives  of one and a half million murdered men,  women, and children. Another half million lost  their homes.  In a July 24, 1915 cable, American Consul  Leslie Davis said of the genocide, ‘‘I do not  believe there has ever been a massacre in the  history of the world so general and thorough  as that which is now being perpetrated in this  region or  that a more  fiendish, diabolical  scheme has ever been conceived by the mind  of man.’’  We commemorate  the 20th century’s  first  genocide not only  to honor  the  lives of  the  dead, but because  its effects are still very  much with us.

The Association of  Indian Physicians of  Northern Ohio (AIPNO) is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1983, with the mission of using its united resources and knowledge for the welfare and healthier living of the  community that they serve. The organization  hosts bi-annual Health-Fairs where member  physicians volunteer  their  time and skills  to  those of the community free of charge. Their  continued service to both the nation and the  state of Ohio exemplify responsibility and civic  virtue.  In addition to their health fairs, the Association of Indian Physicians of Northern Ohio is a  supporter of medical camps in India, such as  the Medical and Surgical Camp of Bidada  Sarvodaya Trust  in Kachchh. These camps  provide medical and surgical treatment to over  1200 villages and impoverished areas.  The Association of  Indian Physicians of  Northern Ohio  runs various continuing education and learning programs for its members  and students. The organization also has  its  own medical journal, AIPNO Pulse, and provides medical advice to residents of Northern  Ohio  through  their contributions  to Lotus, a  community publication.  Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me  in honor of  the Association of  Indian Physicians of Northern Ohio, which works to unite  Indian physicians in order to achieve their mission of providing  their combined skills and  knowledge  for  the betterment of Ohio and  service to the community.  f  TRIBUTE  TO  TELACU  FOR  ITS  COMMITMENT TO THE ADVANCEMENT AND EMPOWERMENT OF  LATINOS  HON.

763,85,2011-04-15,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with great  honor that I rise today and ask Congress to  recognize May 20th as TELACU Scholars  Day.  The TELACU Education Foundation was established  in 1983  to  respond  to crisis-level  dropout  rates  for Latino Students and has  since grown  into  the  largest community and  economic  development  corporation  in  the  United States. TELACU is a pioneering institution committed to service, empowerment, advancement and the creation of self-sufficiency  within the Latino community.  To  address  the  distinct  struggles many  Latino youth  face, TELACU established  the  LINC TELACU Education Foundation (LTEF).  For upwards of  two decades,  the Education  Foundation has been working towards removing the formidable barriers that could prevent  Latino youth from achieving academic success  and providing them with professional and academic role models. I am proud of the way the  LINC TELACU Education Foundation has contributed  to  the development of our  future  Latino leaders.  The TELACU Education Foundation realized  that there is no more vital asset in any community than its human capital and began their  efforts to reverse these trends. For instance,  The LINC TELACU Scholarship Program is an  exemplary program that helps students realize  their dream of a college education by providing scholarships and supplemental support.  Although TELACU understands  that  financial assistance is a vital component for college  students  to achieve academic success,  they  also  recognize  the  underlying  challenges  many  young  adults  face  including  socioeconomic  factors,  family responsibilities, cultural identity, and financial solvency. Students  who are the first member of their families to  pursue a college degree often must make their  own academic support system  in order  to  achieve  their dreams. TELACU understands  these challenges.  The LINC TELACU Scholarship Program  provides its youth not only with monetary assistance, but with  the counseling,  leadership  training, and  time management  training necessary to help students achieve their dreams.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  today to honor TELACU, the LINC TELACU  Education Foundation and for Scholarship programs like this one, for believing in the dream  of higher education for all of America’s next  generation of leaders. I extend my congratulations to the TELACU scholars and the people  who make their dreams a reality as they celebrate  the 28th Annual TELACU Education  Foundation Scholarship Awards Dinner, Building the Dream, on Friday May 20th, 2011.  f  ARMENIA REMEMBRANCE DAY  HON. DOUG LAMBORN  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 15, 2011  ",2011
764,85,2011-04-15,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Speaker, on April 24,  2011, the world will commemorate Armenian  Remembrance Day and remember  the one-  and-a-half million Armenians that endured unspeakable suffering and loss at the hand of  the Ottoman Empire during World War I.  In addition to the loss of so many Armenian  lives, the twentieth century also bore witness  to the loss of six-million Jews and four-hundred  thousand other persons deemed  ‘‘non-  desirable’’ by the Nazis, the loss of millions of  lives in Russia and in China by communist tyrannies, and modern day horrors in Cambodia,  Rwanda, and Darfur. All too often, we have  not learned from past genocides. As the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states ‘‘No  one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel,  inhuman or degrading  treatment or punishment’’ and that ‘‘Everyone has the right to life,  liberty and security of person.’’  Though nothing changes the fact that mass  killings and unspeakable acts of brutality occurred, today I wish to learn from the past to  better bring about hope for a brighter, more  peaceful future and reconciliation of the people of Armenia and Turkey.  Only with a thorough examination of history  and open acknowledgement of  the past will  fully underthe Armenians be  the plight of  stood.  As we continue confronting atrocities taking  place today, and seek to prevent them from  occurring in the future, we must also be resolute in acknowledging genocides of the past.  f  A TRIBUTE TO SARAH SAVAGE  RAYMOND  HON.

Sarah Savage Raymond has been a resident of Brooklyn since 1927, when, at the age  of 22, she moved from her home in Baltimore.  During her more  than 80 years  in Brooklyn  and  the Tenth Congressional district, Mrs.  Raymond has been a positive example for all  and a valued member of her community.  Mrs. Sarah Savage Raymond has been involved with the First AME Zion Church, originally the Fleet Street Church, since she first  moved  to New York and remains an active  participant. The First AME Zion Church  is  where Sarah met and married her husband,  Mr. Robert Raymond and where she became  involved in her adopted community, becoming  a member in the lodge and on the committee  visiting the sick.  Through more than a century of life, Mrs.  Raymond has kept her indomitable spirit and  remains alert and energetic. Although Mrs.  Raymond has no biological children, she has  three very close relatives that are extremely  supportive of her who live in the Bronx, New  Jersey and Pennsylvania. She also has  five  nieces and nephews that reside in Maryland  that also keep in touch with her. Mrs. Sarah  Savage Raymond has seen and heard what  most of us could only read in history books  and she is always willing to share her experiences with those who are interested in listening.  Mrs. Raymond says that she is ‘‘thankful’’ to  be one hundred six years of age because she  did not expect to live this long. She adds, ‘‘I  appreciate every year and did the best that I  could.’’ It is precisely this humble and exemplary attitude  that has preserved Mrs. Raymond in health and happiness for so long.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Mrs.  Raymond  for her extraordinary accomplishments and her spirit which reflect the best our  nation has to offer.  f  RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST FLIGHT OF  THE SPACE SHUTTLE  HON.

767,92,2011-04-15,Ms. SPEIER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to celebrate the retirement of Mike Murphy, the San  Mateo County Counsel.  I had the great privilege to work with Mike  when  I was a member of  the San Mateo  County Board of Supervisors. He is an exceptional  public  servant,  legal  expert,  human  being and a dear friend.  Mike was born in Yokohama, Japan on November 17, 1948 as the son of a military family. He went to Pacific Grove High School from  where he graduated  in 1966. He  then attended  the U.S. Military Academy at West  Point and graduated in 1970. He later served  on the Military Academy Advisory Committee.  Mike laid the ground work for his legal career at Boalt Hall School of Law at UC Berkeley. He graduated in May of 1978 and just six  months  later was admitted  to  the California  Bar.  In May of 1982, Mike started serving in the  office of the San Mateo County District Attorney. In 1987, the civil division of the office became the San Mateo County Counsel where  Mike continued  to serve. He was appointed  one of two Chief Deputies in 1998 and Assistant County Counsel in 2006. In 2007, he became Counsel until his retirement on March  18, 2011.  Mike served as the principal land use attorney for 22 years, a pressure cooker of a job  that he made appear effortless. Among his  highest achievements were the defense of the  County’s Local Coastal Program and Measure  A, a coastal protection initiative and the defense of Measure T, authorizing  the Devil’s  Slide tunnel bypass. During his entire career,  Mike worked as a legal advisor on the San  Bruno Mountain Habitat Conservation Plan, a  landmark  environmental  document  that  he  demonstrated his legal skill in drafting.  In 1988, Mike and San Mateo County celebrated a  true David vs. Goliath victory. The  Port of Oakland was about to dump 7 million  tons of dredged spoils into the ocean off the  San Mateo coast. The Half Moon Bay Fishermen’s Marketing Association filed a lawsuit to  stop  the dumping but  lost  in  federal court.  Mike and his colleague Stephen Toben studied the case and filed a suit for injunctive and  declaratory relief. It was their legal expertise  and perseverance that resulted in a victory in  front of the California State Court of Appeals.  While  I was  in  the California Senate  in  2003, Mike defended my financial privacy legislation and faced strong opposition from multinational conglomerates. Again, his outstanding  legal acumen  succeeded  in protecting  the  rights of San Mateo County residents.  Mike has also been serving on the Military  Academy Advisory Committee  for  the 12th  Congressional District for many years, helping  select  the next generation of America’s officers.  Mike is the loving husband of Gayle Murphy, his wife of 28 years, and the proud parent of their two daughters Erin and Shannon.  In his well deserved retirement, Mike will undoubtedly enjoy  the additional  time he will  have to read and attend San Francisco Giants  games.  Mr. Speaker, I ask this body to rise with me  to honor an extraordinary man, Mike Murphy,  for his dedication to public service and justice  in San Mateo County.  f  CELEBRATION OF ANTIQUE  TRACTOR PRESERVATION DAY  HON. JO ANN EMERSON  OFMISSOURI  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 15, 2011  ",2011
768,92,2011-04-15,Mrs. EMERSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the celebration of Antique Tractor Preservation Day in West Plains, Missouri. West  Plains, Missouri represents a growing community that is creating a new tradition for tractor  enthusiasts across the country.  Antique tractors and farm machinery serve  as a reminder of a key part of our nation’s agricultural heritage. Antique Tractor Preservation Day provides an opportunity  to display  these  tractors  in a venue where enthusiasts  can share their stories with one another. Enthusiasts who share this common interest can  share their passions for buying and restoring  Antique Tractors.  Antique Tractor Preservation Day also provides others, who might not be enthusiasts, an  opportunity  to  learn more about agricultural  history and  to better understand and appreciate  the significant advancements American  agriculture has made over the last century. It  is  important  to carry on  this  legacy by preserving our antique  tractors  for generations  into the future.  Mr. Speaker,  I commend Michael Hinton  and the West Plains community for their work  in creating an opportunity  for enthusiasts  to  come together and to celebrate this proud heritage and rich history.  f  TRASH REDUCTION ACT OF 2011  HON. JAMES P. MORAN  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 15, 2011  ",2011
769,92,2011-04-15,Mr. MORAN.," Mr. Speaker, our 308 million  American citizens throw away nearly 496 billion pounds of trash each year, a staggering  amount by any analysis. And a sizable contribution  is  from disposable  items,  including  plastic and paper bags. That’s why today I am  introducing the ‘‘Trash Reduction Act of 2011’’  along with my co-sponsor, Congresswoman  ELEANORHOLMESNORTON. We’re asking  for  your  support  in moving  this bill  favorably  through the House.  Just how bad is the problem? According to  the U.S. EPA, the average American throws  away about 4.4 pounds of trash each day or  1,600 pounds per year. That’s nearly 248 million tons of American garbage each year. To  put that in perspective, it’s enough trash to fill  a football-field-sized hole over 93 miles deep.  Or create a similar-sized stack of garbage that  reaches low earth orbit. This amount of trash  could cover the state of Texas two and half  times or fill enough trash trucks to form a line  to the moon.  We consume an estimated 12 million barrels  of oil and copious amounts of natural gas annually to make plastic bags that are used once  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:26 Apr 16, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15AP8.070 E15APPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011
770,99,2011-04-15,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker,  legislation  is  the eighth—and  I hope  Continuing Resolution  the Congress  whole will be considering this fiscal year.  Throughout this debate, I have rejected the  false choice between deep cuts that harm our  fragile economic recovery or shutting down the  government. Rather, as Ranking Member of  the Budget Committee,  I have argued  for a  middle ground of graduated and predictable  fiscal reform that both supports our recovery  and reflects our values and priorities as a nation. In that regard, I am pleased that today’s  agreement reduces non-emergency outlays by  only $352 million for the rest of FY 2011—and  then spreads the next $20 billion in cuts over  the next five years.  I have also made clear that our nation’s fiscal  imbalance cannot be addressed solely  through reductions  in  the 12 percent of  the  budget representing non-security discretionary  spending. Like the Bipartisan Fiscal Commission, I believe the final solution must include  savings from our defense budget, adjustments  to mandatory spending, and  increased  revenue. In my judgment, that revenue can and  should come from comprehensive tax reform  that eliminates  tax  loopholes and  reinstates  the Clinton era marginal rates  for upper  income earners.  Mr. Speaker, to govern is to choose, and today’s legislation contains choices I would not  have made. For example, because I believe  the United States should be second to none  when  it comes  to medical and scientific research, I do not think it makes sense to cut  $260 million  from  the National  Institutes of  Health. Additionally, because our economy  needs more clean energy, reducing energy efficiency and renewable energy research, development and deployment by $407 million is  a visible step in the wrong direction. Finally,  because our nation deserves a 21st century  infrastructure and  the  jobs  that go with  it,  slashing nearly $1 billion  from  the Clean  Water and Drinking Water Revolving Funds is  clearly misguided.  In my view, medical  research, clean energy and infrastructure are all  examples of investments we can and should  be willing to make in order to build a healthier,  cleaner and stronger America.  While I am acutely aware of this bill’s shortcomings,  I also believe  today’s agreement  contains some  important victories.  In a very  challenging fiscal environment, we have been  able to fund critical educational priorities. The  Head Start program  serving our  youngest  Americans will get a $340 million  increase,  and  the maximum Pell Grant award will be  maintained at $5500 so deserving low-income  students can go to college. Additionally, with  our unemployment  rate at 8.8%, we have  largely protected vital job training funds at a  level of $2.8 billion. Finally, while I do not believe the Republican party has any right to impose its ideological agenda on the District of  Columbia, this bill eliminates the vast majority  of extreme policy riders in HR 1 ranging from  women’s health to public broadcasting to the  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Law  to  the  EPA’s efforts to combat climate change.  Mr. Speaker, this has been a far from perfect process, and not surprisingly, today’s legislation is a far from perfect measure. But it is  apparently the best we can do in this sharply  divided Congress—and in the final analysis, I  believe  it  is preferable  to shutting down  the  government.  f  STATEMENT OF REP. EDWARD J.  MARKEY ON THE NINETY-SIXTH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  ARMENIAN GENOCIDE  HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY  OFMASSACHUSETTS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, April 15, 2011  ",2011
771,99,2011-04-15,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  today, we remember and honor the victims of the Armenian Genocide, and we call, once again, for  passage of a resolution affirming the Armenian  Genocide in the U.S. Congress.  Between 1915 and 1923, a campaign conceived and executed by the Ottoman Empire  forcibly deported nearly 2 million Armenians  from  their homes, resulting  in  the deaths of  1.5 million innocent children, women and men.  The history surrounding  this  issue  is abundantly clear—genocide did occur.  While the target of this campaign of extermination was  the Armenian people,  it was  indeed a crime against all people—and we must  not forget lest we let it happen again. On this  day every year, communities across our nation  and across  the world come  together  to  remember this great tragedy. On this day, we  are all Armenians.  The  term  ‘‘genocide’’ had not  yet been  coined in 1915, when the first Armenians were  driven from their homes. The definition of this  most profound crime against humanity came  in 1944 from Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew  who  survived  the Holocaust by  fleeing  to  America after the fall of Warsaw to the Nazis.  In the wake of World War Two, Lemkin led the  international community to establish the United  Nations Convention on  the Prevention and  Punishment of Genocide. Lemkin’s definitive  example of genocide was the crimes against  the Armenians.  And as we commemorate  the Armenian  Genocide, we must  redouble our efforts  to  stop similar crimes being committed  today.  The scorched  towns of Darfur,  in western  Sudan, continue to suffer mass murder, displacement, rape, and torture at the hands of  the government and  its militia allies.  In  the  Democratic Republic of  the Congo, armed  forces continue  to  target ethnic populations  with abductions and violence, leading to more  than 5.4 million civilian deaths in the past 15  years. And just weeks ago, the humanitarian  group Doctors Without Borders was forced to  suspend clinics in eastern Congo due to attacks from armed Congolese soldiers. These  ongoing genocides must be stopped.  Immediately.  In order to eliminate these genocides in the  future, we must keep alive the memories of  genocides past.  The U.S. House of Representatives has had  before  it,  for many years now, a  resolution  which clearly affirms the United States record  on  the Armenian Genocide.  I have been a  strong supporter and vocal cosponsor of this  resolution in every Congress, and I remain so  today.  Last year, when  the Foreign Affairs Committee voted in support of the resolution, Turkey  recalled  its Ambassador  to  the United  States. Turkey’s leaders continue to say that  properly recognizing  the Armenian Genocide  will harm U.S.-Turkey relations—that it is not  the right time to pass this resolution. But it is  always ‘‘the right time’’ for the truth.  Already, 43 states and 20 nations have officially recognized the Armenian Genocide, and  it is time for the United States to do the same.  After all, how can we have the moral authority  to call out and condemn  the genocides  in  Darfur or Rwanda when we are unable to acknowledge the tragedy of Armenia? I look forward to the day that this truth can be spoken  aloud, in one voice, by our government, and  by governments around the world. Because it  is the truth.  In 2009, the governments of Turkey and Armenia announced a roadmap for normalizing  relations between the two countries. In a process brokered by Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton, the two countries signed protocols to  resume diplomacy and end the Turkish blockade of Armenia. However, before the ink had  dried on  those accords,  the Turkish government backtracked on its commitment by adding additional preconditions.  The people of Armenia continue to face the  devastating hardships wrought by  the dual  blockades of Turkey and Azerbaijan.

772,2,2011-05-02,Mrs. MILLER  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, nearly 10 years ago, 19 cowardly terrorists, acting on the orders of  Osama  bin Laden, murdered nearly  3,000 innocents. And yesterday, justice  was delivered to Osama bin Laden at  the hands of Navy SEAL Team 6 and  the incredible professionals at the CIA.  This justice, Mr. Speaker, has been  long in coming and is a direct result of  the  eternal  vigilance  of  our  intelligence professionals, the brave men  and women in our military, our national security leaders, our President,  and the American people.  This Nation will always stand strong  and united against our enemies. We  will not back down, and we will never  surrender.  This should stand as a message to our  terrorist enemies.  If you choose  to  stand against freedom and liberty, and  if you choose to murder the innocent,  no matter how long it takes, we will  hunt you down and bring you to the  same  justice  that was  received  by  Osama bin Laden.  Mr. Speaker, today let us all say a  prayer of remembrance for those we  lost on 9/11 and those we have lost in  defense of freedom. And let us say a  prayer of thanksgiving for those brave  American men and women who have  continued to protect liberty, freedom,  and democracy around the globe.

773,2,2011-05-02,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, as we all,  understandably, join in extending congratulations to the President and Navy  SEAL Team 6 and all those who have  been involved in the amazing accomplishment of last night, I think it’s  very important for us to look back almost 10 years ago.  I have just gotten off the phone with  former Speaker Dennis Hastert, who  reminded me  that when  the attack  took place on September 11 of 2001,  President Bush and he and others came  together to do everything that we possibly could to ensure that the United  States of America would never face the  kind of attack that we had on September 11. Our former colleague Porter  Goss, who was chairman of the Intelligence Committee, went on to serve as  Director of Central Intelligence, and  our former colleague, Jane Harman, of  course, going back to the time when  President Clinton was President—so  many people have been involved in this  effort to ensure that we would not face  the kind of attack that we did.  And, Mr. Speaker, I think it’s very  important to note on this day that we  have been successful  in the past 10  years. We, of course, as reports have  come forward, need to remain vigilant.  But I want to extend congratulations  to all those who have played a role in  ensuring our safety.  f  b1410  THE CHILDREN’S HOME  PROTECTION ACT OF 2011  (Mr. BACHUS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

774,2,2011-05-02,Mr. BACHUS.," I just returned from  my home State of Alabama, where we  have lost over 250 of our citizens. The  loss of  life would have been much  greater  had  NOAA  and  Dr.  Jane  Lubchenco and her wonderful staff not  given us an early warning. But some of  our storms hit at night, and people  were unaware of it.  I am joining several of my colleagues  today to reintroduce legislation that  Brad Ellsworth and I have introduced  in the  last two Congresses, to have  weather radios installed in manufactured housing. This would save many  lives. One of the advocates of this lost  her 2-year-old child. The Senate has  not passed this legislation, but we are  going to try again this year, and if we  are successful, we will save lives.  The cost of these radios is less than  $10, but the cost of not having them, as  we found out this weekend in Alabama,  is the loss of many lives.  f  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL OF  THOSE WHO ENSURE OUR SAFETY  (Mr. DREIER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  A GREAT DAY  (Mr. GINGREY of Georgia asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",2011
775,2,2011-05-02,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, today is a great day in the history  of our country. I can’t remember a better day.  Thinking back to maybe 1980, when  our ice hockey team beat Russia in the  semifinals and went on to win the gold,  that was at the height of the Cold War.  Shortly after, Nikita Khrushchev took  off his shoe and said, ‘‘We will bury  you.’’ Yes, that was a great day that  we had back in 1980. But today, the  ‘‘Finally, we got him’’ moment in regard to, yes, I am talking about Osama  bin Laden.  I want to take an opportunity, Mr.  Speaker, to commend the President,  commend the CIA, commend our military, commend the Navy SEALs, the  brave men and women that effected  this. They have been working hard.  And let’s not forget the intelligence  officers that worked so diligently at  Guantanamo Bay, at Gitmo, not torturing but getting intelligence, finding  out who that courier was, the best  friend of Osama bin Laden that lived in  his neighborhood  in Pakistan. Intelligence is how we got him.  It’s a great day. Let’s all take credit.  Let’s  commend  the  President. We  should be tremendously proud today of  this  accomplishment—this  guy,  the  monster that caused 3,000 people to die  on 9/11 and 17 on the USS Cole. And the  men and women that have given their  lives defending this country since then,  God bless them.  f  RECESS  ",2011

779,9,2011-05-02,Mr. STUTZMAN.,"  I thank my colleague, Congressman BURTON, for his  comments.  What a momentous day, as he said,  that we can all take courage and to  look to the future, but as well as celebrate the ending of a chapter that has  caused so much pain and so much fear  in the lives of many Americans.  Three weeks after my wife and I had  our  first born  child, our American  homeland was attacked by terrorists  on September 11, 2001. As I held my  baby boy, I knew that I had to do something, and ensuring the future security  of my two sons is the reason I ran for  the U.S. Congress.  The terrorist attacks on 9/11 tested  our security, our defense, and our fortitude in protecting our country, but  we have not stood idly by. For nearly  10 years now, our American soldiers  have given their lives every day in Operation New Dawn, Operation Enduring  Freedom, and now Operation Odyssey  Dawn to protect our Nation and to secure justice. Their service demands respect and admiration.  b1920  Last night, justice was served. bin  Laden has been the leader and the symbol of al Qaeda for more than 20 years,  continually plotting attacks against  the United States and its allies.  The word ‘‘Qaeda’’ means foundation  or base. Osama bin Laden was the head  of  this  foundation,  the  face of  terrorism around the world, a foundation  upon which its members expected to  erect a vigorous, widespread network  spreading terror around the world.  Well, folks, we have beheaded their  foundation. We  have  beheaded  al  Qaeda. And should they continue, we  will be glad to bring justice and help  them join their leader once again if  they so choose.  We must continue to fight. Our third  President, Thomas Jefferson, said this:  ‘‘Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom.’’  We must use our strength and cultivate our relationships with the people around the world to ensure we take  a  stand against cruel dictatorships,  tyranny and radical Islam.  As I work with Congress and military  commanders,  I will  fight  to honor  those who have died to secure our freedom because they deserve our utmost  respect, and we  should only be  so  grateful.  I  congratulate  the men  and  the  women of our military and intelligence  communities who have devoted their  lives to this mission. For this, our soldiers have America’s boundless gratitude.  I also want to commend and congratulate President Obama and President Bush for their determination and  their willingness to continue the fight,  to pursue Osama bin Laden, who has  been the eluding terrorist, the face of  terrorism  around  this  world.  And  today, freedom has been victorious.  I am honored to represent the people  of  Indiana’s Third District and am  proud of Indiana’s 14,700 members of  the  Indiana Army and Air National  Guard. It  is the dedication of these  men and women and their families who  have brought the leader of al Qaeda to  justice and will continue to bring justice to those who seek to destroy freedom and destroy America.  As Winston Churchill once said: We  sleep safe in our beds because rough  men stand ready in the night to visit  violence on those who would do us  harm.  So, Mr. Speaker,  today  is one of  those days that I didn’t know that I  would ever see, but stand here knowing  that we have been victorious, but also  know that the fight in front of us is not  over with; that we will continue to be  vigilant;  that we will  support  our  troops, our men and our women, our  Commander-in-Chief  in this  fight on  terrorism.  ",2011
780,9,2011-05-02,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," I thank my  good  friend, Congressman STUTZMAN,  for his remarks, and I really appreciate  you taking your time to come down  here tonight.  Congressman STUTZMANtalked a little bit about the military, and I really  appreciate that because we have thousands, hundreds of thousands of men  and women in the military defending  our freedoms all around the world, in  Afghanistan and in Iraq, and we have  them in Germany and we have them in  Korea. We have  them  in bases all  around the world making sure that the  freedoms we enjoy today and tonight  will be there tomorrow for us and our  kids and our grandkids.  But tonight I’d like to read a little  bit of an article that was written just  yesterday by a  fellow named Marc  Ambinder with the National Journal.  And I think it’s really well done, and it  points out all the hard work that went  into going after Osama bin Laden.  The  team  that killed Osama bin  Laden were members of the counterterrorism unit for the Navy, known as the  Navy SEAL Team 6. It’s a highly elusive group that was developed in the  1980s to rescue American hostages in  Iran. They exist outside the military  protocol and engage in operations that  are at the highest level of classification. The fact that Team 6 is front page  news today is a measure of how important the publicity about bin Laden’s  killing is to the U.S., because normally  you don’t hear about these guys.  The President gave the order on Friday morning for the operation to pursue bin Laden. The strike began early  Sunday morning, at the Ghazi Air Base  in Pakistan,  the MH–60 helicopters  made their way to Osama bin Laden’s  tightly guarded compound, which is 70  miles from the center of Islamabad.  The helicopter carrying the team of  SEALs malfunctioned. Can you imagine that? They’re over their target and  the helicopter  stops working. As  it  hovered outside the high walls, the  pilot gently landed inside the walls of  the 3-story condo, but he couldn’t get  the helicopter going again.  And  yet  the  assault  team  disembarked to raid the massive, walled  compound, prepared to take bin Laden  dead or alive, even though they knew  there was a chance they wouldn’t have  a ride back. Their lives were at risk,  and yet they went ahead and carried  out their mission.  Bin  Laden was  discovered  using  women as human shields as American  forces fired at him. One of the women  was his wife. Bin Laden was shot in the  face by the SEALs during a firefight  after  resisting capture. Three other  males were  killed  along with  bin  Laden. One of them was his adult son.  With the team still in the compound,  the commander on the ground told a  remote  commander  that  they  had  found bin Laden. The Special Forces  blew up  the malfunctioned chopper,  helicopter, then escaped in a reinforcement close to 4:15 p.m., just 40 minutes  after they landed.  The West Wing staff worked most of  the day on the operation. President  Obama joined senior national security  officials in the Situation Room that  afternoon as the  firefight was monitored.  Leon Panetta, one of our old colleagues here, was  in his conference  room at the CIA headquarters, which  he had turned into a conference center  to give him constant contact with the  tactical leaders of the strike team. And  I want to compliment Leon as well. I  hope he’s paying attention to this.  Less than 12 hours after the raid, bin  Laden’s body was taken to the aircraft  carrier, USS Carl Vinson, and he was  buried in the North Arabian Sea overnight. A DNA match from the remains  confirmed that bin Laden was dead at  age 54.  And of course President Obama made  the official announcement of his death  from  the East Room of  the White  House at 11:35 p.m., and he said what  all of us really agree with: ‘‘Justice has  been done.’’  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:41 May 03, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K02MY7.021 H02MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

832,23,2011-05-02,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, we have  heard some terrible stories about severe weather and the damage it is causing across the United States. My heart  goes out to the people of Tuscaloosa,  AL, and all the communities in the  South that were ravaged by tornadoes  of record force and velocity.  In the Midwest, our problems are  more subtle but also devastating  in  terms of the impact of floodwaters. It  is nothing new in our part of the world.  We have the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers at the southern tip of our State, further north on  the Mississippi, the Illinois River and  the Missouri River. Whenever there is  heavy rainfall in one area or more, it  ends up raising the levels of those rivers to perilous heights, which can inundate communities.  I can’t tell my colleagues how proud  I am of the people who come forward in  the midst of this type of challenge  every single year. Thank goodness it  seems as though there is never a lack  of volunteers. People are always willing to step up, starting with the National Guard. They always do the best  job possible, and I thank them over and  over for what they do. Then, local law  enforcement works overtime—the firefighters, the police, and all the rest.  Then there is the extra work that is  going on in hospitals and clinics and  nurses and doctors working overtime.  In my part of the world too, State  and Federal employees have pitched in  at every level, starting with the Army  Corps of Engineers, the Department of  Natural Resources of the State of Illinois, the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It  is an  amazing outpouring of support.  Last Friday, I boarded a plane in Chicago and flew down to Marion, IL, and  took a helicopter into Cairo. Cairo, of  course, is at the southern tip of our  State, as I mentioned earlier, at the  confluence of the Ohio and the Mississippi Rivers. I saw there some things  going on  in the town of Cairo,  IL,  which were truly frightening and disturbing.  This is a town which in its heyday  was one of the major port cities in Middle America. Cairo, as the Ohio and  Mississippi Rivers came together and  then coursed on down to the Gulf of  Mexico, was a major city with major  economic activity. Over the years, as  river traffic changed and the economy  changed, Cairo changed too. Now it has  a population of a little less than 3,000  people. Many of them are very poor.  They have an African-American mayor,  Mayor Childs. I believe he is their first,  if not their second, African-American  mayor. They have had issues of racial  strife over  the  last  50 years. They  struggle to keep businesses in place.  Their schools are always challenged,  and now, on top of that, comes a flood.  If you went along the Ohio River  leading up to Cairo, you would see an  amazing levee. It is the kind of wall of  protection, concrete wall of protection,  which every river community would  love to have—on the Mississippi side,  not so much. But the interesting thing  I found when I went down there is even  that side of the river, the Ohio River,  with this huge concrete levee, has serious problems. It turns out that the  water table is so high in Cairo, IL, that  the pressure of the rising Ohio River is  forcing the water into what are known  as sand boils. So out of nowhere, in the  midst of a lot or a street, up pops a  geyser of river water. You think, what  is going on here? It is 10, 15, 20–50 feet  away from the levee. That is because  the entire ground is so saturated and  the river  is working  its way underneath, eating up the underlayment.  I walked along there with a National  Guardsman who was taking pictures of  the scene. We went to one street that  had been closed with two major openings where water was bubbling, and as  the National Guardsman was taking  my photograph, the street collapsed  under him and he fell 2 or 3 feet down  because all of this water has eaten out  all of the substrata under this street.  That is why this has become so serious  that the mayor, Mayor Childs, started  with  the  voluntary  evacuation  and  then last Saturday night said: Let’s everybody  leave  this  town. We don’t  know what is going to happen next.  That is the reality not only of Cairo  but of several other communities.  The 2,800 people of Cairo, IL, were  evacuated Saturday when  the Ohio  River reached its highest level since  1937. It rose above the 151⁄2-foot level  this weekend and  is expected to go  higher. Five other Illinois communities  are now under a voluntary evacuation  order. The people of Old Shawneetown,  Junction, Brookport, and Golconda are  being asked to clear out for their own  safety.  The biggest threat of major damage  is still at Cairo. I was in Cairo just a  few days ago, and I can tell you the  water levels there were continuing to  rise.  I show you a picture of a home in  Cairo, IL. The water level is already so  high that the home is uninhabitable. I  saw many homes like this, but I also  saw some superhuman efforts which  are hard to even describe, where people  decided, even with a home that close to  the river, they were going to build a  wall of sandbags around their home  and save it. It sounds impossible, but  they are doing it. The sandbags are up  to 5 feet high, holding back the water  which, if they were not there, would  have inundated the home. The pumps  are pumping water out from the home  into the surrounding areas, and people  are up night and day, 24 hours a day, in  rowboats, going back and forth trying  to preserve the one thing on Earth that  means so much to them—their home.  That is the kind of battle that is taking place in homes all around Alexander County and Cairo. The sustained  high water level has put an unprecedented amount of pressure on the levees.  As I mentioned earlier, these giant  sand boils are forming, and they are  working all night to try to contain  them. Local volunteers and National  Guardsmen are doing all they can, but  the Ohio River is expected to stay at or  above flood stage for the foreseeable  future, and the levee may not withstand that pressure. If Cairo’s  levee  bursts, the Army Corps estimates the  town will be inundated with as much as  15 feet of water.  The entire State of Illinois is operating under a state of emergency; 320  National Guardsmen are on hand to  help  evacuate  people  and monitor  water levels. The State has issued and  helped fill more than 1 million sandbags, working with  the Guard,  the  Army Corps of Engineers, and local responders to put in generators and supplies where they are needed.  My thoughts are with the people and  families affected by the floodwaters in  southern Illinois, especially those who  had to leave their homes. I am grateful  for all the people, military and civilian  alike, who are working around  the  clock to control the Ohio River.

836,30,2011-05-02,Mr. LEAHY.," The Senate must do better. We must work together to ensure  that  the Federal  judiciary has  the  judges it needs to provide justice to  Americans  in courts throughout the  country. Judicial vacancies throughout  the country hinder the Federal judiciary’s ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a backlog of  cases that prevents people from having  their day in court in a timely fashion.  This is unacceptable. That is why Chief  Justice  Roberts,  Attorney  General  Holder, and the President of the United  States have spoken out and urged the  Senate to act.  Just before the Senate adjourned for  its two-week Easter recess, the White  House Counsel spoke to the American  Bar Association about the need for a  sense of greater urgency in filling these  judicial vacancies. I hope that we will  follow  this  advice  and make  real  progress to ensure that the Federal  courts are able  to  function  for all  Americans.  We have a long way to go to do as  well as we did during President Bush’s  first term, when we confirmed 205 of  his judicial nominations, bringing the  vacancy rate down from 10 percent to 4  percent. We confirmed 100 othose judicial nominations during the 17 months  I  was  Chairman  during  President  Bush’s first 2 years in office. So far,  well into President Obama’s third year  in office, the Senate has only been allowed  to  consider  79  of President  Obama’s Federal circuit and district  court nominees. We remain well short  of the benchmarks we set during the  Bush administration; 79 is well short of  205.  EXHIBIT1  [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,  Apr. 27, 2011]  BUSINESS, DEFENDANTSHARMEDINCOST-  CUTTINGATFEDERALCOURTS  (By Ashley L. Belleau)  Just as budgets matter, so does justice.  The two are connected. Making sure we have  enough judges in our federal courts will save  dollars, not waste them.  The insufficient number of judges in our  federal courts is costing our country in dollars and protracted litigation. Manpower and  money are  foolishly wasted. Record caseloads in many federal judicial districts cause  trials to be delayed, especially civil cases.  This is not good for the state of justice in  our nation.  The fact that we don’t have enough judges  to decide promptly  the  federal civil and  criminal lawsuits in our country owes itself  to the Congress and the president. Both have  failed to create enough judgeships in high-  caseload areas of the country, like California  and the border courts in Texas. Both have  failed to keep the process moving by timely  providing capable, qualified  individuals to  fill judgeships as they open up due to retirement, death or resignations.  As a result our federal court system is  bursting at the seams. With 12 percent of  judgeships vacant, temporary judgeships expiring, and more courts in emergency mode  than ever, there is an unprecedented crisis in  our third branch of government. The phrase  ‘‘justice delayed is justice denied’’ describes  the dire situation  in many  federal courthouses. Judicial vacancies plainly undermine  the capacity of our courts to render justice  within a reasonable period of time.  Sadly, few Americans understand the impact these judicial vacancies have on their  lives.

837,37,2011-05-02,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, on  April 7, a pall passed over my hometown of Stamford, CT, when the news  began to spread that Mrs. Betty Ruth  Hollander, one of its leading citizens  and a good friend of mine and my family, had passed away peacefully. A pioneer, entrepreneur, philanthropist, inventor, and a devoted wife, mother, and  grandmother, Mrs. Hollander  lived a  truly remarkable life that touched and  inspired almost everyone she met. Her  passing  is a great  loss not  just  for  those of us who were lucky enough to  know her personally, but for the entire  Stamford community and well beyond.  In 1962, while raising four young children, Betty Hollander founded Omega  Engineering  out  of her kitchen  in  Stamford. At a time when women faced  pervasive discrimination in many industries, Betty  utilized  her  steady  work ethic and sharp business acumen  to grow Omega from a firm focused on  manufacturing  a  single  line  of  thermocouples to a globally recognized  business  that  produces  over  100,000  state-of-the-art products for measurement and control.  Omega’s record of success gave Betty  the opportunity to serve on a number  of corporate boards, including Target  Corporation—then Dayton Hudson Corporation—Peoples United Bank  and  Southern New England Telephone. She  was also deeply  involved with many  charities, and served on the boards of  Yale New Haven Hospital, St. Joseph’s  Hospital  and St. Vincent Hospital,  Bridgeport, CT. among many other corporations and nonprofit organizations.  Alongside all her success and busy  schedule, Betty remained deeply committed to her family. Even when serving as corporate executive officer of  Omega, when  asked her  occupation  Mrs. Hollander would reply that she  was ‘‘a wife and mother.’’ Later, she  was able to add ‘‘grandmother’’ to the  title. These,  she  insisted, were  the  most important roles she ever played.  In 1952, she married Milton Bernard  Hollander, her best friend since high  school, beginning a strong 58-year marriage characterized by extraordinary  mutual devotion. Together, they had  four  children,  Eva  Lynn,  Steven,  Aaron,  and  Joel,  and  nine  grandchildren.  To get a sense of the truly exemplary  person that Betty Hollander was, all  you need to do is look over an online  forum set up to honor her memory. Already, over 100  individuals  from all  walks of life have taken the time to express their condolences and share their  favorite memories of Betty.

843,51,2011-05-02,Mr. COSTELLO.," Mr. Speaker, 96 years ago  this month, the Ottoman Empire began a brutal campaign against  its Armenian citizens,  marking the beginning of the Armenian Genocide. At the end of this atrocity in 1923, more  than 1.5 million Armenians had perished.  Once again, despite the absence of an official recognition on behalf of the American government, I stand to commemorate the Armenian Genocide. This  injustice deserves  recognition by the U.S. For years, a resolution affirming the U.S. position on Armenian Genocide has been introduced in the U.S. House of  Representatives and, as a member of  the  House Armenian  Issues Caucus,  I have cosponsored that resolution.  Over two dozen countries and 43 states, including my home state of  Illinois, have affirmed the Armenian Genocide, demonstrating  unwavering support for this position. As I have  said before, there will never be a convenient  time  to  officially  recognize  the Armenian  Genocide, but we must do what is right and  officially declare these atrocities as genocide.  The official commemoration of the Armenian  Genocide also provides an opportunity to recognize the indomitable spirit of the Armenian  people. Their daily contributions to our communities are the best testament of their kindness, strength and commitment to justice and  peace. As a member of  the Tom Lantos  Human Rights Commission, I call on my colleagues in Congress and the Obama administration to join me in recognizing the 96th anniversary of  the Armenian Genocide and  the  significant contributions of the Armenian people.  f  NEAL STANLEY TRIBUTE  HON.

844,51,2011-05-02,Mr. TIPTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize Neal Stanley of western Colorado.  Mr. Stanley is the director of the Great Western Oil and Gas Company, and will receive  ‘‘Wildcatter of  the Year’’  for his work  in  the  field of natural resources.  There are few people who possess the level  of experience and knowledge that Mr. Stanley  provides both his company and the state of  Colorado. He has spent over 35 years working  in the oil and gas industry, serving on several  public and private boards. Most notably, he  was president of the Independent Petroleum  Association of Mountain States from 1999 to  2001 and Senior Vice President–Western Region for Forest Oil Corporation.  Mr. Stanley will  join a  long  list of distinguished  recipients of  the  ‘‘Wildcatter of  the  Year’’ award. His devotion to the oil and gas  industry  is proven by his exemplary career,  and  the expertise he has provided  through  decades of work. There is little doubt that he  has contributed  to  the success and prominence of the industry and all the companies  he worked for.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is an honor  to  recognize  Neal Stanley  today. He has given years of  service  to a number of companies and  the  state of Colorado. He will be appropriately  honored with  the  ‘‘Wildcatter of  the Year’’  award and will continue to lead our country’s  charge into its wealth of natural resources.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF  MITCHELL MULAS  HON. MIKE THOMPSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 2, 2011  ",2011
845,51,2011-05-02,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Speaker,  it is with both great sadness and a sense of  great honor that I rise today, along with my  colleague, LYNNWOOLSEY, to honor and pay  tribute to Mitchell ‘‘Mitch’’ Mulas, of Sonoma,  California, who passed away March 31, 2011  of complications following heart surgery.  It is no exaggeration to say that Mitch Mulas  was an  icon  in Sonoma County and a role  model for generations of fire fighters, teachers  and students, and  farmers. He  represented  the best in community service and in devotion  to his family.  Mitch was born  in 1928  in Sonoma, California, the son of an Italian immigrant father  and a mother who survived  the 1906 San  Francisco earthquake. He met his wife, Nilda  when he was 15 and she was 13. They had  their  first date  three years  later, and  three  years following that, they were married. Nilda  was his partner, friend and soul mate and survives him in his passing.  Mitch was a dairy farmer and a leader in the  county’s agricultural organizations. He  joined  the Farm Bureau after he graduated from high  school and served as President  from 1965–  1967 and 1985–1986. He was  inducted  into  the Sonoma County Farm Bureau Hall of  Fame in 2002.  He took a brief hiatus from leadership positions within the Farm Bureau to serve on the  Sonoma Valley Unified School Board  for 12  years  from  1969  to  1981. His  influence  stretched  from  the classroom  to  the  football  field, where he anchored a favorite spot in the  bleachers each season. Not only did he receive  the  district’s  ‘‘Salute  to Education’’  award but  the Sonoma Valley High School  Athletic Hall of Fame created the Mulas Family Recognition Award in his honor, which is  presented annually to persons or businesses  in  the Sonoma Valley who have contributed  time and  resources  to student athletes and  coaches.  Mitch was also the ‘‘Chief,’’ a title he wore  with distinction and pride. In 1942, at the age  14, he helped his father start what later became  the Shell-Vista Fire Protection District.  He served first as a volunteer firefighter, was  named Assistant Chief in 1955 and served in  that position until he was named Chief  in  1968. He served  in  that position until his  death.  Mr. Speaker, Mitch Mulas was a farmer, educator, activist and sports enthusiast who also  protected his community for 69 years as a fire  fighter. But above all else, he was a devoted  family man who is survived by his wife, Nilda,  four children, six grandchildren and two great  grand children. An entire community mourns  his passing, and  it  is appropriate  that we  honor him at this time.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF  MITCHELL MULAS  HON. LYNN C.

848,58,2011-05-02,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the outstanding achievements of the  International Eye Foundation as it celebrates  its 50th anniversary. IEF, which I am proud to  say is based in my congressional district, is  dedicated to the prevention of blindness and  restoration of sight worldwide.  In 2010,  together with its partner eye care providers in  Africa, Asia, Latin America, and  the Middle  East, IEF treated over 2 million people.  The history of IEF’s work is fascinating. Dr.  John Harry King, Jr., IEF’s founder and a pioneer of corneal transplantation, sought to address the high rates of blindness in the developing world and established the International  Eye Bank  in 1961 under  the auspices of  CARE/Medico. American eye surgeons were  posted to the St. John Eye Hospital in Jerusalem to perform corneal transplant operations  and train local surgeons. Dr. King soon realized, however, that much of the blindness in  the developing world was preventable and that  care could be provided before people became  blind. The name of  the organization was  changed  in 1965  to  the  International Eye  Foundation, which  sharpened  its  focus on  blindness prevention and primary eye care.  In order to remedy the dearth of eye specialists in developing countries, volunteer ophthalmologists were posted by IEF to countries  throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America.  Through IEF’s Society of Eye Surgeons, Dr.  King hosted a World Congress every  four  years, one of  the earliest  international eye  meetings, bringing together distinguished leaders  in ophthalmology and development specialists from around the world.  Throughout the 1970’s, IEF facilitated many  ophthalmic training and exchange programs in  Africa,  the Middle East, and Asia.  In 1972,  U.S. eye surgeons were posted  to Ethiopia  and Kenya and, from 1976–1984, the USAID-  supported  ‘‘IEF Kenya Rural Blindness Prevention Project’’ became a model for East Africa. The training of ophthalmologists and Ophthalmic Clinical Officers was expanded while  countless general physicians, nurses, and village health workers were  trained  in primary  eye care. IEF facilitated an exchange program  that exposed U.S. Navy residents to the challenges of providing eye care in Africa and the  Middle East and brought doctors from Egypt  and Ethiopia to the U.S. for fellowships. Ophthalmic and nurse training programs and vitamin A deficiency control programs were also  conducted  in Afghanistan, Pakistan,  India,  Bangladesh  and  Indonesia.  IEF  started  Malawi’s Ophthalmic Medical Assistants training program in 1980. Importantly, the Queen  Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre had no  eye specialist, so  IEF posted a series of  American ophthalmologists  there  to provide  care, surgery and training over 15 years.  IEF helped establish Eye Banks in Amman,  Jordan in 1979 and in Cairo, Egypt in 1980.  Throughout  the  following decade, U.S. ophthalmologists were posted to a number of Caribbean nations for one year at a time. In 1985,  IEF became the first eye care development organization  to be accepted  into  ‘‘official relations’’ with the World Health Organization. In  1986, USAID awarded child survival grants for  programs in Africa and Latin America that focused on reducing blindness from vitamin A  deficiency, the leading cause of blindness in  children in developing countries at that time.  The availability of Mectizan® (the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin) from Merck & Company  in 1990 allowed IEF to pioneer the first community-based ivermectin distribution programs  in Guatemala, in collaboration with Africare in  Nigeria, and in 1992 in Cameroon and Malawi.  In  the early 1990’s,  IEF was awarded a  USAID grant for programs in Bulgaria and Albania. The grant enabled 18 U.S. ophthalmologists to provide training and technology for  vitreo-retinal surgery and retinopathy of prematurity  to save  the sight of newborns.  IEF  also collaborated with  the Dana Center  for  Preventive Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins  University to conduct the first random sample  epidemiological blindness prevalence survey  in Bulgaria.  In the mid-1990’s, LEF recognized that eye  hospitals  in developing countries were still  underperforming and lacked management capacity  and  revenue  sources.  The  SightReach® Management program was then  established, reorienting the organization’s mission to sustainability planning for eye care institutions. This  included developing a model  that can be adopted by eye units in different  regions of  the world.  In 1999, with  seed  money from USAID, IEF focused on reducing  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:23 May 03, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A02MY8.023 E02MYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011
849,3,2011-05-09,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I note that  Vice President BIDENwas just here in  the Chamber for the swearing-in of our  newest Senator, DEANHELLERfrom Nevada. I add my congratulations to now-  Senator HELLERjoining this body.  f  REDUCING THE DEBT  ",2011
850,3,2011-05-09,Mr. KYL.," Vice President BIDENhas  been kind enough to host discussions—  starting last week and going into this  week and perhaps beyond—with Members of the Senate and the House of  Representatives to try to find a way to  reduce the huge debt that hangs over  the United States, as a prelude, I am  sure he would put it, to the Congress  acting on the President’s request that  Congress increase the debt ceiling.  There have been generally two ways  suggested on how to deal with our debt.  Many Democrats believe the wealthy  in the United States do not pay enough  taxes, and therefore one way to reduce  the debt is for taxes to be increased, especially on the wealthy. Most Republicans believe that is a bad idea, that  since debt is our problem and we got  into debt because we have been spending too much, the better way for us to  deal with the problem is to begin reducing our spending and to make sure  over the years we are able to do that.  There are a couple of  interesting  things that have just come out in the  news recently that I think bear on this  argument.  A lot of folks wonder about the debt  burden  in the United States, and  I  think it is useful to point out the fact  that last week the Wall Street Journal  reported that the Joint Committee on  Taxation found that ‘‘the percentage of  U.S. households paying no federal income tax  . . . reached 51%  for  [the  year] 2009.’’ I think that is the first  time in the history of America that  over half of Americans didn’t pay Federal income taxes. I do not think that  is a good thing. While certainly people  in the lower income brackets are not  able to pay very much in the way of  taxes,  I  think  even  a  very  small  amount, an affordable amount, would  be appropriate so everybody has what  they call skin in the game, so everybody understands the relationship between the burdens and the benefits of  government. I would not impose a significant tax on the lower half or certainly not the lower 10 percent, but I  think it is important for all Americans  to know we all have a stake in this,  and that more than half of the people  cannot  just  expect  the  so-called  wealthy to bear all of the burdens of  government.  But the question remains, are American wealthy taxpayers undertaxed? I  think a useful measure to look at here  is a comparison with other countries,  for  example. The OECD  countries—  which stands for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development—  are generally regarded as the most advanced economies in the world, and the  United States is one of those countries.  A study that is based on 2008 statistics found that the highest earning 10  percent of the U.S. population paid the  largest share among 24 countries examined, even after adjusting for their relatively higher  incomes, and  it concluded:  ‘‘Taxation  is most progressively distributed in the United States,’’ the OECD concluded.  The bottom line here is that for a  country to be competitive, the people  who provide the capital  for  job creation,  for economic growth, have to  have some capital remaining after they  have earned it in order to invest that  capital, return it to their businesses,  hire more people, be more productive,  create more wealth, and thereby provide for the families of the people who  own the businesses and, by earning  more income, increase the amount the  Federal Government and the State government take in as revenues.  Republicans are very happy to concede it would be helpful if the government has more revenues in order to  help close this debt gap we have. The  question is how we get more revenues.  We believe more revenues are a function of a growing economy. Here too  some statistics that just came out over  the weekend, I believe  it was, demonstrated that we can actually delay  the  increase  in the debt ceiling by  some period of time because revenues  to the Federal Treasury have been a  little higher than previously expected.  Why? Because the economy grew more  than expected, and as people made  more money, they therefore paid more  in withholding and in Federal income  taxes. That is the way for the government  to get more  revenue—for  the  economy to do better, for Americans to  do better.  So if you tax more the people who  are the ones likely to do the investing  into businesses, will you get more investment? Will you get more Federal  revenue? Well, you will get a little bit  more to begin with, but in the long  run, you will get less. One of the reasons it is not a good idea to tax more  the very people whom we are referring  to in this study is because half of all  the small business income reported is  reported as part of the highest income  tax bracket for individuals. In other  words, small businesses do not pay as  corporations, they pay as individuals,  and when a small businessman has to  report his earnings, he reports all of  the income from his enterprise. A lot of  that is business expense, but that is  how he has to report it. So you are  talking here about half of all that income reported being taxed at a higher  rate, if, in fact, the President and some  of his colleagues have their way. That  will reduce the amount of investment  and growth in the economy and thereby make it harder for us to pay off this  large debt.  The advocates of a gigantic tax increase are  really very  shortsighted,  therefore,  in assuming  that  if  they  raise tax rates, they are going to get  more revenues. That is what they tried  to do in Japan during the late 1990s. It  did not work out. Japan went back into  a deep recession, and it is not going to  be possible for them to generate existing revenue with their higher tax rates.  The way you get robust growth is not  with higher tax rates but with lower  tax rates. A rapidly expanding economy does create new jobs and income  for investment and wealth-creating enterprises, and obviously some of that  wealth flows back to the government  and can be used to reduce the debt.  But the policy tools we decide upon  in these negotiations will have a lot to  say about how we are able to reduce  the debt and whether part of that will  be a result of economic growth in the  future. Obviously, the point here is not  just to have economic growth so the  Federal Government can earn more in  income tax revenue but to promote  American prosperity and a better future for our families.  So the question is, Will we impose  tax hikes that discourage investment  and punish  job creation or will we  make the tax system more efficient  and conducive to growth?  I wish to cite a couple of studies to  show why it is most important for us  to focus on reducing spending rather  than raising tax rates, because spending cuts, not tax hikes, are the best  way to close the massive budget gap  and help to produce economic growth  in our country.  One study was performed by two Harvard economists, Alberto Alesina and  Silvia Ardagna. By  studying  large-  scale fiscal adjustments by wealthy developed countries  from 1990 to 2007,  they determined that  ‘‘spending cuts  are much more effective than tax increases  in  stabilizing  the debt and  avoiding economic downturns.’’ Moreover, they found ‘‘several episodes in  which spending cuts adopted to reduce  deficits have been associated with economic expansions rather than recessions.’’  Two economists at Goldman Sachs,  Ben Broadbent and Kevin Daly, undertook a  similar  study and  reviewed  every  major  fiscal  correction  in  wealthy nations since 1975. They found:  Decisive budgetary adjustments that have  focused on  reducing government expenditures have (i) been successful in correcting  fiscal  imbalances;  (ii)  typically  boosted  growth; and (iii) resulted in significant bond  and  equity market outperformance. Tax-  driven fiscal adjustments, by contrast, typically fail to correct fiscal imbalances and  are damaging for growth.  So reducing spending was the way  not only to reduce the debt of the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:27 Feb 15, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S09MY1.REC S09MY1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

852,10,2011-05-09,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. President, the  Department of Justice is a great department, and they have some very  fine people there. I know Mr. Cole has  some good qualities. I supported Mr.  Holder for Attorney General, but I am  very uneasy about the direction the  Department is taking on a large number of issues, and I believe one of the  reasons this  is happening  is because  they have surrounded themselves with  a group of leftist lawyers, activist lawyers who don’t operate according to  the more traditional views of law and  justice in America. That is my view.  Other Senators may disagree. That is  my view. I am not able to support Mr.  Cole for that and the reasons I have  stated. I hope in the future the administration will appoint more nominees  that have proven records of independence, effective prosecution, and commitment to law.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.  ",2011
853,10,2011-05-09,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. President, I greatly  respect my friend from Alabama, Senator SESSIONS, although I come to a  different conclusion in regard to Jim  Cole.  I have worked with Jim Cole. I was  part of a legislative committee in the  House of Representatives that had to  do some very difficult work on an ethics issue involving a former Speaker of  the House of Representatives. It was a  tough decision to bring together six  Members of the House—three Democrats, three Republicans—and do it in a  way  that would maintain  the nonpartisan requirements of an ethics investigation. The atmosphere was very  partisanly charged around the work we  were doing. I know this sounds familiar. People  in Maryland  and Connecticut and around the Nation understand we are working in a very partisan environment, and they expect the  people who are charged at the Department of Justice to work  in a nonpartisan manner.  This is not a partisan position, the  Deputy Attorney General. This  is a  person who is working with the Attorney General, the Nation’s lawyer. We  want somebody who has the experience, someone who has the character  and commitment to carry out this very  important position.  As I said, I have known Jim Cole. He  has 13 years’ experience within the Department of Justice. He is a public interest attorney. That has been  the  largest part of his professional career,  the service of public interests. He has  always followed policy, not politics. He  has a very distinguished career in law,  and he is the type of person we like to  see within the Department of Justice.  As I pointed out, I worked with Jim  Cole when I was in the House of Representatives. We worked on a very difficult  investigation  involving  the  former Speaker of the House of Representatives who  at  the  time was  Speaker. The chairman of the committee was Porter Goss, a Republican  from Florida. Porter Goss’s observations of Jim Cole were that he was a  brilliant  prosecutor,  extraordinarily  talented. Then Mr. Goss goes on to say  that over time, he brought our committee  to  a  bipartisan  cooperation  which was desperately needed in order  to successfully complete that matter.  At the end of the day, the six of us  came  together  in a unanimous  recommendation. That is the type of person Jim Cole is. He was professional  and put policy ahead of politics.  Former Senator John Danforth testified at Jim Cole’s confirmation hearing. John Danforth is a former Republican Member of the Senate. He called  Jim Cole ‘‘a lawyer’s lawyer.’’  Jim Cole has support  from Democrats and Republicans. Former high officials within the Department of Justice have all recommended him, including former Deputy Attorneys General  appointed  by  both Republicans  and  Democrats.  Let me quote one other person I had  hoped would be greatly respected on  both sides of the aisle; that is, Fred  Fielding, the White House counsel for  former President George W. Bush. He  said Mr. Cole ‘‘combines all the qualities you want in a ‘citizen public servant’—he understands both sides of the  street and is smart and tenacious, and  is a person of unquestioned honor and  integrity.’’  That  is what Fred Fielding,  the  former White House counsel to President Bush said, about Jim Cole.  Jim Cole is supported by former RNC  officials and DNC officials because he  is nonpartisan. He is a nonpartisan person who has put public interest law as  his top priority.  I was listening to Senator SESSIONS  talk about terrorism. We have had a  spirited political debate taking place  in this country over the best way to  bring terrorists to justice. Mr. Cole,  however, will always put principle over  politics, and he is committed to evaluating each case and matter that comes  before him based on the facts and the  law. That is what you want from the  Department of Justice. They are the  values and the character we want in  our Nation’s Department of Justice,  and Jim Cole will bring that to the Department of Justice—already brought  it to the Department of Justice.  The bottom line about Mr. Cole’s approach on fighting terrorists is one I  believe we all believe in. We are a nation at war with al-Qaida, the Taliban,  and their associated forces. We need  tough, aggressive, and flexible policies  that recognize the paramount importance of providing the President with  the ability to use all of the  lawful  tools—all of the lawful tools—of our  national power to protect the American people and bring terrorists to justice.

854,17,2011-05-09,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President,  I  rise  in opposition to cloture on the  nomination of James Cole to be the  Deputy Attorney General of the United  States.  Last December, I objected to further  consideration of Mr. Cole’s nomination  because of the refusal of the Department of Justice, DOJ, to comply with  reasonable document requests from the  Senate Select Committee  on  Intelligence. Unfortunately, the President  decided to circumvent the Senate and  recess-appointed Mr. Cole on December  29, 2010.  Here we are 5 months later: the Justice Department is still thwarting the  Intelligence committee’s oversight.  The documents we have requested all  relate to the Guantanamo Detainee Review  Task  Force  that made  recommendations to the Administration  on whether to transfer, release, or detain Gitmo detainees. Over 2 years ago,  the committee became aware of rising  recidivism rates among former Gitmo  detainees. At that time, the rate was  around 11 percent—it is now above 25  percent. Congress has a unique obligation to the American people to ensure  that no more dangerous detainees are  released from Gitmo, and that those  who have been released do not resume  their terrorist ways. Each one of the  documents we are seeking is essential  to understanding why the task force  made certain recommendations about  certain detainees, especially those detainees our  intelligence professionals  judged were too dangerous to transfer.  The detainees remaining at Gitmo  are among the worst of the worst, yet  many are still designated for transfer.  Given the upward trend in recidivism  rates, the  Intelligence Committee  is  reasonably concerned that some of the  detainees who have been or may be  transferred to third countries will reengage  in  terrorist  activities. Lingering questions about the monitoring  capabilities of countries that have accepted detainees add to these concerns.  In making its recommendations, the  task force operated under guidance and  recommendations  from  the Attorney  General. The Department of Justice,  however,  refuses  to provide a September 2009 Attorney General memorandum  that  reportedly  recommends  that an entire category of detainees be  presumed to be eligible for transfer. If  classes of detainees are to be presumed  to be eligible for transfer by DOJ, then  I  think  the  Intelligence Committee  should know about it and why such  guidance was considered appropriate.  The Department has also refused to  provide  the  Intelligence  committee  with the task force’s recommendations  for the disposition of the detainees.  The task force documents we have been  given have entire portions of their recommendations blacked out. This is no  way to conduct oversight and it certainly puts the committee at a disadvantage in trying to understand why  transfer decisions were made. Interestingly, the Department has provided the  recommendations  made  by  review  boards during the previous administration.  As with the September 2009 memorandum,  the  Department  argues  against giving this information to Congress because of ‘‘deliberative process.’’  That assertion may work in a FOIA  case or  in the context of executive  privilege, but there is no legal basis for  using  it to deny congressional oversight, especially where the documents  pertain to national security matters. It  is time for the Justice Department to  abandon this baseless argument and  give us the documents.  The Intelligence committee is also  waiting for a list of the 92 detainees  who were approved for transfer as of  August 28, 2009, prior to the application  of the September 2009 memorandum.  The Department indicated in November  2010 that the list would be provided,  but the committee has yet to receive  it.  Last Friday, we heard from the Department for the first time in months,  wanting to work something out on the  documents in advance of the cloture  vote on the Cole nomination. This is a  bit ironic, considering that letters and  e-mails from last year have gone unanswered. The best thing they can do now  is to honor our request and give us the  documents that we have requested.  The Department’s obstruction of a  congressional review is not the only  reason I am opposing cloture. Mr. Cole  still has not explained comments he  made about the 9/11 attacks. In September 2002, he wrote an op-ed in which  he called these attacks ‘‘criminal acts  of terrorism against a civilian population.’’ Following this logic, he diminished 9/11 to being no more than ‘‘the  scourge of the drug trade, the reign of  organized crime, and countless acts of  rape, child abuse, and murder.’’ He also  argued  that  the protections of our  criminal justice system ‘‘must be applied to everyone to be effective.’’ I  could not  disagree more with  this  statement—no  terrorist deserves  the  benefits of our criminal justice system.  Mr. Cole has neither rejected these  comments, nor really explained why he  made them. Until he does so, I have to  question his  judgment and his suitability to be the second-in-command at  the Justice Department.  It is for these reasons, I cannot support cloture on the nomination of Mr.  Cole at this time.  The  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2011

863,31,2011-05-09,Mr.  BINGAMAN.,"  Mr.  President,  today I am introducing the Outer Continental Shelf Reform Act of 2011. This  is a bill intended to reform the management of energy resources on the  Outer Continental Shelf, and to create  a culture of excellence for the industry  and the regulatory agency going forward.  Following the tragic Deepwater Horizon oil rig accident last year, we have  learned a lot about changes that need  to be made by the industry and the regulatory agency to ensure that accidents like this never happen again. In  addition, we should do more, and create a system for the management of  offshore energy development that is a  model for the world.  This bill is intended to put in place  the changes  that can achieve  these  goals. It is identical to a bill reported  unanimously by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in the last  Congress. In the intervening time since  the  committee’s action,  there have  been developments and new information that may indicate the need to update or change some parts of the bill.  But, as we begin to work on this issue  again in the committee, I believe that  it is sensible to start with last year’s  bill. I look forward to working with my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  address these important issues.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 917  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

876,1,2011-05-13,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, on  the violent Texas/Mexico border, Zeta  pirates gunned down David Hartley on  the  international  border  of Falcon  Lake last year. His wife, Tiffany, was  able to escape the shots fired at her.  This happened 8 months ago. David is  one of 111 Americans murdered in Mexico last year, and none of these cases  have been solved.  Tiffany was in D.C. this week trying  to  find out some answers about her  husband’s murder. She wants to know  why the Federal Government is not investigating this case and also putting  pressure on Mexico to do the same.  Only Sheriff Sigi Gonzales of Zapata  County, TX, seems to be pursuing the  criminal case.  However, when ICE Agent Jaime Zapata was murdered  in Mexico,  the  United States quickly, and rightly so,  pressured Mexico  to  investigate  the  homicide. Our government should be  just as concerned about David Hartley  and the other Americans murdered in  lawless Mexico.  Why is our government apparently  missing in action?  Also, President Calderon was in D.C.  this week to receive an award. Too bad  he didn’t stay around long enough to  meet with Tiffany and explain to her  why his government isn’t doing anything to bring the killers of her husband to justice.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE  STATE OF ISRAEL  (Mr. BARROW asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2011

883,8,2011-05-13,Mr. REICHERT.," Mr. Chairman and  Members of this great body, this week  is Law Enforcement Memorial Week.  We have thousands of police officers  from across the Nation here in Washington, D.C., to honor those fallen officers of last year and years before.  Last year we lost 156 police officers  who were killed in the line of duty protecting each and every one of us. This  year we are on track to beat that  record, unfortunately. Sixty-eight police officers have already been killed. I  stand today to have all of you recognize their sacrifice and the  families  who have survived and the police officers who continue marching on.  I yield to the gentleman from New  York.  ",2011

When we lay down at night to sleep  and we kiss our children to bed and we  thank God for the country we live in  and pray for good things for the day  ahead, we know that whether we’re in  a small town with one sheriff or a police department  like New York City  that has over 38,000, that somewhere  there are men and women who are out  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:43 May 14, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A13MY7.007 H13MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

886,15,2011-05-13,Mr. GOHMERT.," Madam Speaker, I  want to identify with the comments of  my  friend  from  Indiana. Well  said.  Great thoughts.  We have wonderful  friends  in this  world, as a Nation. But we need to recognize who are our friends and who are  our enemies and who are the places,  the countries, the peoples that intend  us harm, who are the people that are  willing to assist us in encouraging and  allowing for freedom to spread around  the world.  We should be well aware that there  are people across our border in Mexico  who are not Mexicans, people who  would like to see this Nation fail as  such an important keeper of the peace.  We know that Hezbollah has been  setting up camp across the U.S. border  in Mexico; that they have been working with drug cartels in Mexico, and it  appears we see some of the signs of  that in the ways that people are murdered, the way the crime business has  developed.  We know that people coming across  our border into this country, a significant percentage at  least, are other  than Mexican. OTM, they’re classified.  So many of them from the Middle East,  many who are taught to try to appear  as Hispanic and come across and try to  avoid indicating anything that would  give away the fact that they are coming here, not for jobs, but to set up to  try to do us harm.  So when you are aware that there is  so much violence on the border, Americans being murdered down on both  sides of the border, we have two lakes  between Texas and Mexico, Lake Falcon and Lake Amistad, together about  85 miles of international border that  should  be  patrolled  by  the United  States Coast Guard. But this administration doesn’t wish to see the Coast  Guard there.  Visiting with the Texas Governor a  few weeks ago, he had made clear,  please help me in urging the administration to allocate some Coast Guard  resources to these  lakes, where the  drug cartels are bringing dangerous  people, bringing drugs, bringing mayhem across into the U.S. Texas is committing money, resources, manpower  on the lake, but it’s a Federal job.  And what we’ve seen with this administration, when a State does too  good a job or tries too well to do the  job  the Federal Government  is not  doing in order to protect its State, this  administration decides to sue them.  We’ve seen also recently that if there  is plenty of evidence to support that  people or groups are funding terrorism  in the world, and it is radical Islamists  that are doing that, then this administration wants to embrace the groups  that we have evidence are funding terrorism, rather than confront them and  stop them. It’s an interesting time we  live in.  I do want to follow up on the President’s comments. Here Texas has suffered the  loss of around 2.3 million  acres burned in the last decade or so.  Other Presidents,  other  administrations, and even this administration,  have  recognized  that when  177,000  acres, 300, 400, 500,000 acres have been  destroyed, that is certainly worthy of  declaring a disaster area in order to  provide Federal support.  Texas is a donor State. We always  put much more into the Federal Government from Texas than Texas ever  gets back. We’re proud to be such an  important, vital part of  the United  States.  It does follow that when there is such  a compelling disaster as the wildfires  in Texas, 2.3 million acres destroyed,  that it would be nice to have the support of the President. But just as this  administration  snubbed all  the contributions that Houston provided to  the shuttle program, and refused to  allow a shuttle to be on display permanently in the NASA Space Center in  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:54 May 14, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K13MY7.036 H13MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

961,29,2011-05-13,Mr. ADERHOLT.," Mr. Speaker, today I would  like to recognize a fallen hero, Senior Airman  Mark Andrew Forester, from my hometown of  Haleyville, Alabama.  Mark was killed in action on September 29,  2010, while so valiantly  trying  to  rescue a  wounded comrade, SGT 1st Class Calvin Harris; Mark ran into direct enemy fire, without regard of his own life, in an attempt to pull his  comrade back  to safety. Both died on  that  day, and only earlier on that morning they had  taken a beautiful photo together.  Mark was a highly decorated Airman who  gave that last full measure of devotion and received many honors, such as Purple Hearts  and a Bronze Star with Valor. He was so very  loved by all of the men in his unit, and his  beautiful family.  This coming Saturday, May 14, marks what  would have been his 30th birthday. In recognition of  that occasion  I ask  that a  tribute  to  Mark be  inserted  in  the RECORD, written by  Bert Caswell, at the behest of Mark’s fellow  airman George Earhart who was in battle with  him on that day. Airman Earhart was inspired  by Mark, that Mark was the greatest person  he has ever met, and was greatly impacted by  his love of all the children in theater.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Mark and  his family, as they continue to mourn his loss.  DEVOUT  All In . . .  All in this our Country of Tis of Thee . . .  There are such brave hearts, such magnificent souls such men as these!  Such Strong Bold Men, who all in Strength  In Honor do so believe!  Freedom Fighters who so live and die . . .  All with their most sacred battle cries!  Who are all so Devout!  All in and out, as all in their most magnificent hues!  As they all so stand so very strong, all for  that old Red, White, and Blue!  And all, with families who but live so close!  As on each new morning, their  love but  means the most!  Who now must so live all in such pain, and in  such heartache to remain . . .  As their most swollen tears upon theirface  fall like the rains . . .  As were you Mark, so Devout! A man for all  seasons, all throughout!  As God, Country, and Family . . . were, but  what you were so really all about!  And, ah yes you were but our Father’s  Son . . .

962,29,2011-05-13,Mr. LATHAM.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the American Legion Auxiliary Unit  278 of Osage, Iowa. The Unit has created a  program entitled ‘‘Merit Awards’’ in which the  unit awards the amount of $300 to each successful applicant graduating with  the senior  class of Osage Community School District.  Unit 278  is devoted  to assisting students  in  their pursuit of higher education and I am honored  to submit  for  the  record  the  following  commentary on the program in Osage.  ‘‘American Legion Auxiliary Unit 278 and the  Merit Award Program:  The Osage American Legion Auxiliary Unit  278 is very much attuned to the importance of  education and financial needs of students in  attending post high school institutions of learning. Our unit had developed a process called  ‘‘Merit Awards’’ whereby we raise monies to  be used for the student applicants in furthering  their education.  Each year we hold an event (Merit Award  luncheon and bake sale) for the community.  Proceeds from the event are used entirely for  Merit Awards. All food for the event is donated  by members and prepared at the site. In addition, members are asked  to either donate  items for the bake sale or contribute $5.00 in  lieu of a baked donation. Our unit boasts 378  members, 35 of whom are Junior members.  One of the highlights of this event is a drawing  for an American flag and flag pole which is installed by the Legion free of charge to the winner.  Each year applications are made available  to  the Osage School district  for graduating  seniors. Our unit has a committee to review  applications and determine the successful applicants. This year we had 10 applicants with  a Merit Award in the amount for $300. Two of  those awards will be made by contributions  from  two  families, one honoring one of our  auxiliary members and the other in memory of  one of our deceased members.  Presentation of these Merit Awards is made  by a member of our unit at the Osage High  School Award Assembly  in May. Unit 278  takes great pride in our efforts to communicate  to students the importance of education and  throughout the year we participate in activities  involved in education.’’  Mr. Speaker, as you can see the American  Legion Auxiliary Unit 278 is a great example  of  the commitment of patriotic Americans  to  their community.  I am honored  to represent  them and all of Osage in the U.S. Congress.  I know all my colleagues will join me in congratulating them for a job well done.  f  GEORGE WASHINGTON BOY’S SWIM  TEAM  HON.

964,36,2011-05-13,Mr. MARCHANT.," Mr. Speaker, Dr. BURGESS  and I rise today to celebrate the outstanding  service and accomplishments of Crown of Life  Lutheran School’s eighth grade class. This  group of nine students demonstrates a level of  commitment and philanthropy positioning them  heads and shoulders above their peers. Their  dedication  to anticipating and seeing  to  the  needs of  their community provides me with  great hope for the future of America. Today’s  students are  tomorrow’s C.E.O.s, Chief Surgeons, and Presidents. These eighth graders  will one day make decisions  that will determine what this nation looks like in the years to  come. We have every confidence that we are  in good hands. They have already learned the  most valuable  lesson—leadership starts with  service.  Throughout the 2011 school year, the eighth  grade class proved themselves to be extraordinary leaders through their service to the students at Crown of Life Lutheran School. Every  day, they cleaned the lunchroom and assisted  in  the school’s weekly assemblies. Monthly,  they helped the school set up for Colleyville  Chamber  of  Commerce  Luncheons.  This  Spring, the girls basketball team helped their  school to win a second place at the State tournament. The boys made an impressive showing as well, placing fourth in their tournament.  These  remarkable  students have participated  in numerous  community projects as  well. They helped to organize a bingo night for  Finley Elliot, a three year-old who just completed a successful kidney transplant in April  of 2011. The $5,000 earnings from the event  provided Finley and his family a much needed  reprieve  from  the extensive medical costs.  They also volunteered a day  to clean up  Lakeview Park  in Grapevine  in order  to encourage the maintenance of public parks for  the use of the community. The class also assembled care packages and wrote dozens of  notes  by  hand  to  send  to  our  soldiers  overseas.  We  know  that Crown  of  Life  Lutheran  School  is proud  to claim  these star eighth  graders as  their own, and we are proud  to  offer our sincerest congratulations to Hannah  Andersson, Zachary Dayley, Jacob Diamond,  Sarah Hall,  Justin Hawes, Austin Shone,  Heide Stufflebeme, John Sandfort and Christian Scherff on  their graduation  from middle  school. We wish you all the best.  f  HONORING THE RIVERDALE Y’S  TEEN THEATER PROGRAM  HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 13, 2011  ",2011
965,36,2011-05-13,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker, the Riverdale Y’s  Teen Theater program was established  in  1990 to provide education, entertainment and  enrichment to teens across my district in the  Bronx. The program gives kids age 13–18 a  chance  to  study musical  theater,  to  learn  through music and to perform for their community. This year, they celebrate their 20th season of performances.  The Teen Theater program has  long produced  entertainment  for  residents  of  the  Bronx, who come  to see high-level productions worthy of praise in any context, but especially so considering that the performers are  our community’s young people. This talented  troupe of performers recently broke their own  attendance record during productions of Rent  and The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling  Bee, and they plan more productions in the  coming months.  Children who take part in the program learn  music, dance, dramatic and literary skills and  get  the chance  to perform  for  their  friends,  family and  community. They are enriched  through  the arts,  they  learn  important skills  through the arduous rehearsal process, they  build  self-esteem  and  they make  lifelong  friends. The program has received numerous  National Youth Theater Awards in recognition  of their talented performers, including most recently  for Rent, which won awards  for Best  Ensemble Performance, Best Lead Actor in a  Musical and Best Lead Actress in a Musical.  On behalf of the many alumni of the program, the residents of the Bronx and the entire Seventeenth District, I want to recognize  and honor the Riverdale Y’s Teen Theater and  their director, Laurie Walton, to thank them for  their contributions  to our community and  to  wish them the best of luck in the future.  f  APPLAUDING THE UPPER MERION  SCHOOL DISTRICT  HON.

966,36,2011-05-13,Mr. MEEHAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  applaud the Upper Merion School District of  Pennsylvania  for winning an Environmental  Achievement Award  from  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Upper Merion was  recognized for being a 2010 ENERGY STAR  leader and for reducing its energy consumption by more than 30 percent, an achievement  reached by only about a dozen of the Nation’s  15,000  school  districts. All  six  of Upper  Merion’s schools have earned  the ENERGY  STAR rating and several buildings have energy reductions near 50 percent. The district  has also embarked on an aggressive recycling  program that has resulted in about 50 percent  of  its solid waste being recycled  instead of  going to the landfill. I am proud to represent  the citizens of Upper Merion in Congress, and  their example of stewardship—of a community  taking local initiative to reduce their environmental impact—is a model of bottom-up sustainability  that municipalities across America  should strive to emulate.

It is a thrill and an honor this morning on this propitious day in which a  joint session of the United States Congress will be addressed by Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to introduce  and welcome our guest chaplain of the  day, Rabbi Jeremy Wiederhorn. Rabbi  Wiederhorn is a friend, he is the spiritual leader of The Conservative Synagogue of Westport, and has been so  since 2008. Prior to doing that, he gave  service  in Henderson, Nevada,  for  8  years. He is a leader in the community  and in his synagogue. He is also true to  the ministry dictated by his and so  many of our  faiths,  including, over  time, having  led and mobilized his  community to send an emergency mission to Israel in response to the missile  strikes from Hamas in Gaza.  It  is a real honor.  I know Rabbi  Wiederhorn has served as an important  leader  in Westport  and  throughout  Fairfield County. He has served as a  friend to me. I would say that in addition to his spiritual guidance, he introduced me to cholent, which for this  Presbyterian was a new experience. I  think I thank him for introducing me  to that part of his history and culture,  if not exactly for the culinary experience.  Welcome, Rabbi Wiederhorn.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2011

976,8,2011-05-24,Ms. FOXX.," House Resolution 269 provides  for a modified open rule providing for consideration of H.R. 1216,  which amends the Public Health Service Act to convert funding for graduate  medical education in qualified teaching  health centers from mandatory spending to an authorization of appropriations; H.R. 1540, the National Defense  Authorization Act; and same-day consideration of a rule to consider extending certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. Mr. Speaker, this is the  seventh modified open rule that the  House Republican majority has offered  this Congress, compared to the liberal  Democrats’ one modified open rule during the entire 111th Congress.  The first underlying bill today, H.R.  1216, continues the fulfillment of the  Republican Pledge to America and illustrates that once again Republicans  are keeping our promises to the American people to cut Federal spending.  The  American  people  want  transparency of Washington’s spending of  hard-earned taxpayer dollars. In an act  of gross  irresponsibility, the Federal  Government is spending $1 out of $4 of  gross domestic product.  We hear the term ‘‘Federal money’’  as though it is manna from heaven. Let  me  dispel  that misconception, Mr.  Speaker. The Federal Government has  only the money it takes away from  hardworking  American  families  through taxes or the money it borrows.  As a Nation, we are currently borrowing 43 cents for every dollar spent  at the Federal level.  Some argue that to balance the Federal Government and pay down our  debt, we should raise taxes. As a fiscal  conservative, I have to disagree. Raising taxes on hardworking Americans  and job creators is simply a way to  pass the blame. We must rein in out-of-  control Washington spending and put  an end to it. The American people are  sick and tired of reckless government  spending and Washington’s disregard  for basic budgeting principles of living  within its means. This is one of the  many reasons I urge my colleagues to  support this rule and the underlying  bill before us today, Mr. Speaker.  H.R. 1216 restores congressional oversight to Federal spending by ending the  autopilot spending for physician residency programs at teaching health centers and restoring it to the annual appropriations process. When a program  is put on autopilot, Congress abdicates  its authority to unelected bureaucrats  and takes a hands-off approach. House  Republicans are committed to ending  that approach to Federal spending and  ensuring  that  government  programs  are  accountable  for  how  they  are  spending money. No longer will we accept politically popular excuses. Each  program must prove that it is a wise  steward of taxpayer dollars. If Congress  will not address out-of-control spending now, we are passing the buck to our  children and grandchildren.  Therefore, I commend my Republican  colleagues at the House Energy and  Commerce Committee for seeking to  end mandatory or autopilot funding for  programs  in  the  liberal Democrats’  government takeover of health care.  Because the liberal elites knew their  government takeover of health care  was unpopular and would likely have  consequences at the ballot box, they  included $105 billion in mandatory taxpayer spending in the law itself to protect their favorite programs.  Let me take a moment, Mr. Speaker,  to explain the difference between discretionary and mandatory government  spending. Discretionary spending is appropriated by Congress annually and,  therefore,  subject  to  congressional  oversight  and  review. Discretionary  spending allows Members of Congress  the opportunity to be wise stewards of  the taxpayers’ money by not funding  ineffective or duplicative programs. On  the contrary, mandatory spending operates irrespective of congressional appropriations and must be spent whether we have the money or not. The most  recognized mandatory  spending programs are Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security which operate on autopilot and have not been subject to congressional oversight from year to year  as  funds automatically stream  from  the Treasury to anyone who qualifies  for a particular benefit.  It cannot be emphasized enough that  the liberal elites in Washington chose  to hastily ram through their government takeover of health care with no  regard for the staunch opposition of  the American people. The audacity of  an  elected  official  or,  worse,  an  unelected bureaucrat basically saying  to a taxpayer that he or she knows how  to spend the taxpayer’s money better  than the individual taxpayer is appalling. That  is what the ruling  liberal  elites  in Washington did when they  chose to forgo the annual appropriations, also known as oversight, process  by putting their favorite programs on  autopilot under ObamaCare.  Mr. Speaker, it is my firm belief that  Washington should not be in the business of picking winners and  losers.  During committee consideration of the  underlying bill, my Republican colleagues rightly pointed out that the  liberal Democrats in control last Congress put the funding for residencies at  teaching health centers on autopilot  but  left residency programs at children’s hospitals to fend for themselves  in the annual appropriations process.  In  fact, President Obama’s FY  2012  budget proposes eliminating  funding  for residency programs at children’s  hospitals.  Mr. Speaker, it is hard to understand  why residencies at teaching health centers should receive special treatment.  Why were  these  residency programs  protected while others languished and  were eventually proposed to be eliminated?  b1320  This is a classic example of Washington bureaucrats deciding which programs will win and which will lose. As  I said earlier, every program should be  properly  scrutinized  by  Congress  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:27 May 25, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24MY7.004 H24MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

985,22,2011-05-24,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1216, which rescinds funding  for graduate medical education  in qualified  teaching health centers. The Affordable Care  Act provides funding for the training of medical  residents  in qualifying health centers, which  will strengthen the health care workforce and  support an increased number of primary care  medical residents trained in community-based  settings across  the country. This bill undermines that key objective and in so doing, undermines public health efforts, limits access to  doctors  in communities around  the country,  and weakens our medical workforce.  Teaching health  centers are  community-  based patient care centers  that operate primary care residency programs, such as family  medicine,  internal medicine, pediatrics, and  general  and  pediatric  dentistry. Physicians  trained in health centers are more than three  times as likely to work in a health center and  more than twice as likely to work in an underserved area  than are  those not  trained at  health centers.  Oregon’s  community  health  centers—29  clinics offer care at more  than 150 delivery  sites—provide  high-quality,  comprehensive  health care to more than a quarter-million people across my state. Services  range  from  medical and dental care to prescription medications to behavioral health care. Many centers also provide such support services as  transportation and  translation  to ensure  that  everyone who needs healthcare can access it.  This  legislation, however, would undermine  the ability of these centers to attract doctors  and other health professionals so vital to providing community-based care.  The  Institute of Medicine  reports  that already there is a need for more than 16,000  new  physicians  in  currently  underserved  areas. Unless we invest in medical education  that closes this shortfall, it will worsen in future  years. The Association of American Medical  Colleges estimates that, by 2024, we will need  46,000  additional  primary  care  physicians.  This legislation makes it more difficult to close  this gap.  A recent study by Dartmouth  investigators  published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that beneficiaries living  in areas with better access  to primary care  physicians had lower mortality and fewer hospitalizations. By eliminating  funding  to  train  doctors in community-based settings, this legislation makes it less likely that patients in underserved areas will be able to see a doctor  or to get the care that they need. This legislation will worsen health outcomes  in underserved areas.  Rather than making refinements to improve  the Affordable Care Act, H.R. 1216 merely  eliminates funding. It fails to advance the key  objectives of  the  law  to  improve healthcare  while lowering costs and it fails to offer alternative solutions to meet these important objectives. I oppose this legislation.  ",2011

992,22,2011-05-24,Mr. TONKO.," Mr. Chair, my friends on  the other side of the aisle seem steadfast and determined in their attack on  access  to affordable, quality health  care. Couple that with their plan to  end Medicare, and our Nation’s seniors  are put  in quite a bind. Meanwhile,  they want to place our health in the  hands of Wall Street and Big Insurance, not between doctors and their patients. The seniors in my district and  across the country know that vouchers  will not cover their health care needs.  They see the tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires and handouts for  Big Oil, and are vehemently opposed to  this plan.  Today, we have yet another assault  on affordable access to health care. My  Republican colleagues have found their  next boogeyman: family practice physicians. This is surprising as we have a  dire shortage of primary care physicians in our country.  The American Association of Medical  Colleges has estimated that an additional 45,000 primary care physicians  are required by 2020 just to meet America’s health care needs. A few short  months ago, both sides of the aisle  agreed on the need to build our Nation’s primary care workforce. This is  a proven way to bend the health care  cost curve by decreasing health spending through prevention and early, simple treatment.  Unfortunately,  Republicans  have  since changed their tune. They have  declared that the problem is not that  we have a shortage of these crucial  doctors. Instead, they must believe we  have too many primary care physicians, and so we face this call to eliminate training for those on the front  lines of the fight for quality care.  The underlying legislation guts funding for vital teaching health centers  across our country. Teaching health  centers are residency programs for primary care physicians, providing community-based training for doctors who  will go on to work in rural and in our  underserved areas. From Medicare to  high gas prices to tax rates, my friends  on the other side have proposed time  and time again policies that put middle  class Americans on the  line and  let  Wall Street, Big Oil and Big Insurance  take over and earn big. The constituents in my home district, in the Capital Region of New York State, need a  break. They are looking at the price of  gas, at the price of food and at the  price of prescription drugs, and are just  wondering  how  they will make  it  through the month.  Do we need to balance the budget?  Yes. Do we need to balance the budget  on the backs of hardworking Americans who play by the rules? Absolutely  not.  Mr. Chair, my amendment  is very  simple.

995,29,2011-05-24,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Foxx  amendment and to the underlying bill,  H.R. 1216, to amend the Public Health  Service Act,  to convert  funding  for  graduate medical education in qualified teaching health centers from direct appropriations to an authorization  of appropriations.  This bill would eliminate mandatory  funding that establishes new or expanding programs for medical residents  in teaching health centers and unobligated funds previously appropriated to  the grant program.  Under policies currently being considered by some in the House majority,  academic medical centers and teaching  hospitals face as much as $60 billion in  cuts over the next 10 years to Medicare  funding for indirect medical education  and direct graduate medical education.  These cuts would reduce indirect medical education payments by 60 percent  from the current level of 5.5 percent to  2.2 percent, capping direct graduate  medical education payments at 120 percent of the national average salary  paid to residents.  It would reduce Federal funding for  medical residency training, as wrong  public policy. Given our present situation with the shortage of primary care  and family practice physicians, and the  expected  future growth of our population, it makes no sense for the Republicans to end the present structure  of Medicare. In 2010, 47.5 million people  were covered by Medicare. We have 39.6  million at the age of 65 and older and  7.9 million disabled.  The Republican budget plan  is a  voucher plan that would raise health  care costs and would immediately create higher costs for prescription drugs  for our seniors and disabled. This plan  would end Medicare’s entitlement of  guaranteed benefits and promote rationing by private  insurance companies, who would make decisions on approving or disapproving treatments for  our seniors and the disabled.  The Medicare program is efficiently  managed, devoting less than 2 percent  of  its  funding to administrative expenses. Medicare has dramatically improved the quality of life for seniors  and  the disabled.  It  is  the  largest  source of health coverage in the Nation. Democrats  are  committed  to  strengthening Medicare, not tearing it  down.  Under the guise of reform, Republicans desire to end Medicare as we  know it today.  Last year, the Republicans promised  the American people that jobs would be  their number one priority. Well, I ask,  where are the jobs? But, instead, they  want to make draconian cuts to programs to help seniors and the disabled,  the middle class,  the poor and  the  needy, and yet provide tax cuts of over  $1 trillion to millionaires and billionaires.  And so we ask, where are the jobs and  where are the opportunities? The estimated  1-year  impact of anticipated  graduate medical education cuts for Illinois is $144 million for indirect medical education and $39 million for graduate and medical education, which totals $183 million. If there are no doctors, there can be no medical care.  I urge that we vote against these  measures.  ",2011

998,29,2011-05-24,Ms. WATERS.," I rise in opposition to  the underlying bill, H.R. 1216, which  would undermine the teaching health  centers program, which trains primary  care physicians.  Madam Chairman and members, this  is just one more trick by Republicans  to dismantle health care reform. They  are going after the training of primary  doctors. We need more primary doctors, even if there was no health care  reform. There are many communities  throughout this country that have no  primary health care physicians.  Our Nation is facing a serious shortage of primary care physicians. Primary care physicians are an essential  part of a successful health care system.  They are the first point of contact for  people of all ages who need basic health  care services, whether they are working people with the employer-provided  health insurance, low-income children  on Medicaid, or seniors on Medicare.  The Republicans have made it clear  that they are not concerned about access to basic health care services. The  Republican budget for fiscal year 2012  turns Medicare  into a voucher program, slashes Medicaid by more than  $700 billion over the next decade, and  cancels the expansion of health insurance coverage, which was included in  the The Affordable Care Act last year.  The Republican budget cuts to Medicare are especially detrimental to current and  future Medicare recipients.  Under the Republican budget, individuals who are 54 and younger will not  get government-paid Medicare benefits  like their parents and grandparents.  Instead, they will receive a voucher-  like payment to purchase health insurance  from a private  insurance company.  There will be no oversight to these  private programs. We will not be able  to contain the cost. We will not be able  to mandate what the basic services  should be. As a matter of fact, we know  the stories about the HMOs and the  fact that they had accountants who determined what care you could get, not  physicians who had the knowledge and  the ability  to determine what you  need.  When the first of these seniors retire  in 2022, they will receive an average of  $8,000 to buy a private insurance plan.  That is much less than the amount of  the subsidy Members of Congress receive for our health plans today.  The coverage gap  in the Medicare  prescription drug program will continue  indefinitely. Under the Affordable Care Act, this so-called doughnut  hole is scheduled to be phased out. The  Republican budget will allow seniors to  continue to pay exorbitant prices for  their prescriptions when they reach the  doughnut hole. The Republican budget  also gradually increases the age of eligibility  for Medicare  from  65  to  67  years of age.  Madam Chairman,  the Republican  budget is also detrimental to Americans who depend again on Medicaid, including low-income children, disabled  Americans,  and  seniors  in  nursing  homes. The budget converts Medicaid  into a block grant program and allows  States  to  reduce benefits, cut payments to doctors, even freeze enrollment. Medicaid funding is slashed by  more than $700 billion over the next  decade.  b1630  That  is over one-third of the program’s funding.  Meanwhile,  the Republican budget  extends the Bush-era tax cuts beyond  their expiration in 2012 and cuts the  top individual tax rate down to 25 percent from 35 percent. According to the  Center for Tax Justice, the Republican  budget cuts taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans by 15 percent while  raising taxes for the lowest income 20  percent of Americans by 12 percent.  The national  shortage of primary  care doctors is not a problem for multimillionaires. They will always be able  to find a doctor who will treat them  and pay them whatever they ask for.  But most American seniors need well-  trained primary care physicians and  Medicare benefits that they can rely  on.  I urge my colleagues to oppose the  underlying bill, oppose the drastic cuts  to Medicaid, and oppose the Republican  plan to dismantle Medicare. They’re  trying to dismantle health care reform  piece by piece, inch by inch. Today it’s  an attack on training needed by primary care physicians. What is it tomorrow?  We know that they have a strategy  that  includes hundreds of bills that  would dismantle, again, piece by piece  Medicare reform. It’s not fair, Madam  Chair and Members.

1001,36,2011-05-24,Mr. COURTNEY.," I rise in opposition  to the underlying bill, which, by the  way, is a bill that would repeal a provision of the Affordable Care Act that  was aimed at trying to strengthen the  primary  care  infrastructure  of  this  country, which is in fact a huge challenge for the Medicare program, but for  some reason over the  last couple of  months or so, Medicare just seems to  be the target.  I think it’s important for people to  remember that in 1965 when Medicare  was passed and  signed  into  law on  Harry Truman’s front porch, only half  of America’s seniors had health insurance.  b1730  Part of it was because of the cost,  but part of it was because the insurance companies would not insure that  demographic. It was just simply too  high a risk to write insurance policies  by  individual  companies  for  people  who, again, because of nature carried  the highest degree of risk in terms of  illness and disease. Over time, the genius of Medicare, which was to pool  risk, to create a guaranteed benefit, to  fund it through payroll taxes, to fund  it through Medicare part B premiums,  demonstrated that we could raise the  dignity and quality of life for people  over age 65 and in fact extend life expectancy.  But the Republican Party has been  targeting this program over and over  again. In the 1990s, they came out with  Medicare part C, Medicare Plus Choice,  which was again giving insurance companies a set payment who promised to  provide a more efficient,  lower cost  product  for  seniors. And what happened?  Insurance companies enrolled  millions of seniors in Medicare Plus  Choice products. And realizing  in a  short space of time that they did not in  fact have the funds to create a sustainable product, they canceled coverage  for seniors all across the country.  I was at hearings in Norwich, Connecticut, in 1998, where seniors who had  signed up for these programs suddenly  got notification  in mid-policy year  that the insurance companies changed  their minds, and they dropped them  like a hot potato. In many instances,  seniors who were in the middle of cancer  treatments  and  chronic  disease  treatments were  left high  and  dry  without  coverage. So  that program  failed.  Later, we had Medicare Advantage.  Medicare  Advantage  was  sold  on,  again, the premise that it would provide coverage for seniors cheaper than  regular Medicare. And what  in  fact  happened? The Department of Health  and Human Services had to offer insurance companies 120 percent of the baseline costs for Medicare in order to entice  insurance companies to participate in the Medicare Advantage program; a ridiculous overpayment, treating unfairly seniors who were in traditional Medicare and paying for Medicare supplemental insurance.  Last year we did something about  that unfairness by equalizing the payments to seniors on traditional Medicare  and Medicare Advantage. And  today what we have is the Ryan Republican plan, which says you get an $8,000  voucher if you are under age 55, and  good luck in terms of trying to find  coverage, again, in a market that is  going to be very, very careful about  not extending actual coverage because  of the risk that’s attached to it.  Now, the rank unfairness of saying  that we are going to create a two-  tiered system for people over the age of  55 and people under the age of 55 is obvious even in my own family. I am 58  years old. My wife Audrey, who is a pediatric nurse practitioner, is 51. I get  one version of Medicare; she gets stuck  with  the  loser version of Medicare  under this proposal. Again, the unfairness of it is so obvious to all families  across America. And again, it is one  that is why I think the public is turning so quickly against the Republican  agenda.  And we are told and we are asked:  What’s your alternative? Well, look at  the trustees’ report that came out last  week. Look at it. What it said was that  the Affordable Care Act  in  fact extended solvency for the Medicare program by 8 years. We did suffer some reductions, but that was because of the  economy. Read the trustees’ language.  The smart efficiencies which were introduced  into the Medicare program  through the Affordable Care Act in fact  have made  the Medicare  program  healthier.  And if you look at the Ryan Republican budget plan,  they  took every  nickel of those savings from the Affordable Care Act. Even though that  caucus  demagogued  all  across  the  country, campaigning about so-called  Medicare cuts in the Affordable Care  Act, well, the Ryan Republican plan incorporated every single one of those  changes  in the Affordable Care Act.

1002,43,2011-05-24,Mr.  SMITH  of Washington.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.  I too rise in support of this bill, the  2012 National Defense Authorization  Act. I want to begin by thanking the  chairman and our staffs for the outstanding work that they have done  putting together this bill.  I think Mr. MCKEONhas more than  risen to the level of the bipartisan tradition of our committee. He has upheld  the tradition held by our predecessors  that this committee should work together, Republicans  and Democrats,  that it should be an open and transparent process.  I can say that I and my staff feel  very, very good about the open process  that we have had, although we have  not agreed on everything—we do not  agree on everything—that is in the bill;  but where there were disagreements,  we had an open and honest dialogue.  We had votes in the committee, and  now we will have votes on the floor.  And overall I think the chairman and  the members of both parties and staffs  have put together a very strong bill  that will protect our national defense  and meet the primary duty of this Congress, and that is provide for the national defense and the national security of our country. So I thank the  chairman and his staff for that work,  and I look forward to continuing to  work with him throughout this process.  I also want to note one of our members, who was not able to be there during the course of our markup as she  usually is, but nonetheless contributed  greatly to the process. We all miss Congresswoman GABRIELGIFFORDS’ presence on the committee, but we work  very closely with her staff on issues  and priorities that have been important to her during her time on the  committee, and she and her staff are  still doing an outstanding job with the  committee in contributing to this process. So I thank them, and we all look  forward to GABBYcoming back to this  body and continuing her work.  In putting together this bill, there  are five main areas of priorities that I  think we should focus on. First and  foremost, whenever we have troops out  in the battlefield, as they are in Afghanistan and Iraq, and also spread out  in a whole lot of other countries, priority number one has to be to make  sure that we give them the support, the  equipment and the means necessary to  carry out the mission that we have  given them.  I believe  that  this bill prioritizes  that, both within the base bill and  within the overseas contingency operations funding to make sure that our  troops in Afghanistan and Iraq, elsewhere, have the equipment they need  to carry out the mission that we have  given them.  Second, I believe the counterterrorism in the fight against al Qaeda must  continue to be a top priority of this  committee,  and  I  believe  that we  strongly support that once again. We  all learned as a Nation and the world,  with the killing of Osama bin Laden,  how effective our Special Operations  Command and other elements of our  counterterrorism policy can be, but we  also need to be mindful that the job is  not done, and we continue  to  fund  those priorities.  I do want to specifically commend  the  folks at  the Special Operations  Command. I had the great privilege of  chairing the subcommittee that has  had jurisdiction over the Special Operations Command for 3 years. They do a  fantastic job for our Nation. Certainly,  everybody saw that in the case of getting bin Laden; but they do it every  day in many, many ways that many  people do not know and do not recognize, so I thank them for their outstanding work.  We also have a huge challenge with  the budget. As  the  chairman mentioned, finding efficiencies in the Defense budget is going to be critical. As  we have heard on this floor over and  over in many contexts, we have a massive deficit. We have a deficit that is  over 33 percent of what we spend. The  Defense budget  is 20 percent of the  overall budget. You cannot take 20 percent of the overall budget off the table  and effectively deal with a deficit of  that size.  b1900  We are going to have to look carefully at where we spend our money in  defense, just like everywhere else, to  make sure that we’re getting the most  for our dollar. I believe we have done  that effectively in this bill, but I also  believe that going forward that task is  going to get harder, not easier. We  must  find ways to save money and  spend  it more efficiently within the  Department of Defense. I also believe  that our policy in Afghanistan is going  to be critical.  As I mentioned, we certainly  fund  our troops in the effort that they are  performing right now in Afghanistan,  but going forward, we are going to really need to begin to bring those troops  home to complete that mission. We  will have some amendments that address that issue during the course of  this bill. I look forward to that debate  because I think that Congress needs to  play a strong role in concluding our  mission successfully in Afghanistan.  Lastly, the issue that the chairman  mentioned that I think is very important in this bill is detainee policy and  the AUMF. The chairman very early on  identified this as a clear priority, and I  think he is absolutely right that Congress’ voice should be heard on these  very,  very  important  issues. We’ve  worked  closely  on  that. We  have  reached  some  agreement. We  have  some areas of disagreement. The biggest one we’re going to have an amendment on this is the idea of whether or  not article 3 courts should continue to  be available for Guantanamo Bay detainees and those who would be captured in similar situations in the future.  I  believe  that  it  should. We  shouldn’t always have them in article 3  courts. Military  commissions  have  their  place.  Indefinite  detention  of  enemy combatants has its place. But  article 3 courts have effectively served  this country  for over 200 years. We  have tried and convicted over 400 terrorists  in article  3 Federal  courts.  Right now  in  the United States of  America, we have over 300 of them safely locked up. We can do it. It’s an option we should not take away from the  President.

1004,43,2011-05-24,Mr. BARTLETT.," I rise in support of  H.R. 1540, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012. I have the privilege  of  serving as  the  chairman of  the  Armed Services Committee’s Tactical  Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.  Our  jurisdiction  includes  approximately $78 billion of selected programs  within the Army, Navy, Marine Corps,  Air Force, and Office of the Secretary  of Defense procurement and research  and development accounts.  I first want to thank the subcommittee’s  ranking  member,  REYES from Texas, for his support this  year in putting the bill together. Ours  is a truly bipartisan effort, as it is for  the full committee under the leadership of Chairman MCKEONand Ranking  Member SMITH. The committee’s focus  is on supporting the men and women of  the Armed Forces and their families,  providing  them  the equipment  they  need and the support they deserve.  Our first priority, of course, is in providing the equipment to support our  military personnel serving in Iraq and  Afghanistan. The bill adds no additional funding for the Department of  Defense  programs within  the  subcommittee’s  jurisdiction.  The  bill,  however,  reallocates  approximately  $1.5 billion from canceled, delayed, or  otherwise lower priority programs to  higher priority requirements.  First, an additional $425 million is  provided for modernization of Abrams  tanks and Bradley  fighting vehicles.

1005,50,2011-05-24,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Chair, to my friends on  the other side of the aisle, I am offering an  amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill  which would defund the war in Libya.  The war is unconstitutional. The President  did not come to this Congress, he went to the  U.N. Security Council, he went to a number of  international bodies, but he didn’t come to the  United States Congress. Last week, the President did not observe  the  tolling of  the War  Powers Act, so he’s in violation of the statute.  The action over  in Libya has already exceeded the U.N. mandate; it’s in violation of  the U.N. mandate and there have been violations of international law.  What are we doing there? Why does anyone think we can afford it? Why aren’t we trying to find a path to peace so we aren’t called  upon to spend more money there? These are  questions we have  to be asking;  that’s why  Congress needs  to say we’re not going  to  spend more money there.  People are saying it’s not the United States,  it’s NATO. The Guardian  in  the U.K. did a  study which showed  that 90 percent of  the  cruise missiles are paid for by the U.S. Sixty-  six percent of the personnel working against  Libya are from the U.S., 50 percent of aircraft,  50 percent of all ships—and our government  is saying this is a NATO operation? We have  to recognize what’s going on here, which is an  expansion of the war power by the Executive  and it’s time we challenge that.  One  thing we certainly shouldn’t do  is  to  support the amendment offered by my friend,  Mr. MCKEON, which will hand over  to  the  President Congress’ constitutional authority to  declare and authorize war, substantially altering the delicate balance of power the Founding Fathers envisioned.  The annual  re-authorization  contains unprecedented and dangerous  language which  gives the President virtually unchecked power  to  take  this country  to war and  to keep us  there. The bill substantially undermines  the  Constitution, the institution that the Constitution set up  that  is Congress and sets  the  United States on a path  to permanent war.  Congress has to protect the American people  from the overreach of any Chief Executive—  Democrat, Republican—any Chief Executive  who’s enamored with unilateralism, preemption,  first strike and  the power  to prosecute  war without constitutional authority or statutory  prescriptions.  Permanent global war isn’t the answer. It’s  not going to increase our national security. Far  from ridding the world of terrorism, it will become a terrorist recruitment program. The war  in Iraq is based on lies; the war in Afghanistan  is based on a misreading of history.  Yet in Iraq we’ll spend over $3 trillion. In Afghanistan we’ve spent over half a trillion dollars.  We have people out of work here. We have  people losing their homes, losing their health  care,  losing  their retirement security. All we  hear from the White House is ‘‘we want more  war or more authorization for more war.’’ We  have to stop that and while stopping that we  have to stop this national security state and  stop the extension of the Patriot Act which is  also in this bill.

1011,50,2011-05-24,Mr. WEINER.," Mr. Chairman, you  may recall, I was standing here approximately 2 hours ago waiting to  speak with several other Members on  the efforts of my Republican friends to  eliminate Medicare as we know it, and  for reasons that are known only to the  Chair, I was denied the ability to do  that. Well, I am back.  And just to review the bidding, here  is where it was before that order was  made. We had the chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, a good man, a guy I like, stand  down in the well and say, oh, no—and  this, by the way, is someone who was  elected by the Republican Members to  represent him in races all around the  country, saying that the Ryan plan  wasn’t a plan. It was—and I am quoting  here—a construct to develop a plan.  And he said that the proposal was not  a voucher program. And then he said it  was a one-size-fits-all, that Medicare  was draining our economy is what he  said.  Well,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  that  might be the rationale for our Republican  friends wanting  to  eliminate  Medicare, but none of those things are  true. It is not a construct to develop a  plan. It is the proposal of the Republican Party of the United States of  America to eliminate Medicare as a  guaranteed entitlement. If you don’t  believe me, go get the book that they  wrote. Go get the budget that they  wrote, go get the bill that they wrote.  And if you believe that it’s not a  voucher program, listen to their own  Members talk about it. The Medicare  program today  is not,  I say to my  friends, one size fits all. My good friend  from Georgia (Mr. GINGREY) was on the  floor before talking about how it’s one  size fits all. How can it possibly be you  can be a Member of the United States  House of Representatives and not understand how Medicare works?  Each individual senior gets to go to  the doctor of their choosing, gets to go  to the clinic of their choosing, gets to  decide for themselves where they go,  and then the doctor and the patient  make decisions.  The only question is: Are we going to  say to citizens who are 65 and older,  Here is a coupon. Go buy private insurance at 25 and 30 percent overhead  rather  than  the Medicare  program,  which the actuaries say cost 1.05 percent in overhead?  We have also heard them say, You  are  demagogueing. We  don’t  really  want to get rid of it. You do.  Now, there is a saying here in Washington that a gaffe is when the Republicans actually say what they think. So  there have been plenty of opportunities  to see this gaffe in full play.

1039,71,2011-05-24,Mrs. BOXER.," I just want to acknowledge the hard work of the chairman of  the  Intelligence Committee and  the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee  on the PATRIOT Act and to state I am  on an amendment Senator LEAHYhas  authored which has bipartisan support.  I think Senator LEAHY’s amendment  puts a couple of checks and balances in  this bill that I think are essential. But  I hope we do not have delays because  delays would cause trouble for law enforcement people and for the work we  are doing to make sure we continue  making progress against  those who  would harm this country.  I fully agree with the statements we  have the balance of security and liberty, and I think the Leahy amendment goes a long way toward that. But,  again, we need to give law enforcement  the tools they need.  HOUSEBUDGET  Mr. President, as we look at what is  ahead for us this week, it is not only  the PATRIOT Act, but we also are  going to be looking for votes on a couple of different budget proposals, and I  want to spend some time talking about  the Republican budget that passed the  House that was originally authored by  Representative PAULRYAN. It sort of  got to be known as the Ryan budget,  but let’s be very clear about this: It is  no longer the Ryan budget. It is the  Republican budget.  This is why I say this. Out of all the  Republicans in the House—and there  are a lot of them over there; they run  the place; well over 100—every one of  them voted for this budget except for,  and on our side, not one Democrat.  So let’s be clear what a budget is. I  served on the Budget Committee in the  House and in the Senate. A budget is a  very important document, whether you  write it in your own home for your own  family or you write it in the Senate of  the United States. Why? Because in a  budget you are looking at all your resources and what your priorities are.  If you have an issue with spending—  which a lot of us have in our homes, as  well as having it right here; we know  that; and certainly in my State—this is  when the rubber meets the road and  you have to say: What is important to  us and what is less important?  The questions you ask when you  write a budget around here are: Are our  children important? The answer is, yes.  Is it important we have clean air to  breathe? For me, absolutely. Should  the water be pure? Should we make  sure  the  environment  is  protected?  Yes. Should we have a transportation  system so we can move people and  goods in this century and be the economic world leader? Yes. That is an investment. We go through the budget  piece by piece and we decide what is  crucial.  Of course, we need a strong military.  Having said that, some of us believe it  is time to wind down the two wars we  are in in Afghanistan and Iraq that is  costing us $12 billion a month. We can  use those funds back home and still  keep  the kind  of  counterterrorism  forces we must keep, I believe, in the  region and bring that money home.  There is a lot of talk, a lot of words  are thrown around about how to balance a budget. I have to say, I was fortunate enough to be here, thanks to  the good people of my State, during the  Clinton years,  and we had  similar  issues. What were the issues? We were  running in the red. We had a deficit, we  had a debt, and we had to make sure  the economy kept growing in a robust  fashion. Do you know what we did? We  sat around and said: These are the investments that are important to us.

1040,78,2011-05-24,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Oregon.  ,2011
1041,78,2011-05-24,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, before  my colleague  leaves the Chamber, I  wished to tell him what a welcome addition he has been to the Intelligence  Committee. I have served on that committee for 10 years. We have had excellent  chairs—first, Senator ROBERTS,  then Senator ROCKEFELLER, Senator  FEINSTEIN.  So we continue to try to look for bipartisan support for trying to strike  that balance between collective security and individual liberty. I am struck  both by the clarity of your statement  and the fact that those who are going  to vote on these amendments and the  American people who are listening in  tonight ought to be able to get, in a  straightforward,  easy-to-access  fashion, how the executive branch is currently interpreting the PATRIOT Act.  The fact is, law professors give assignments to their students to write  analyses of  the PATRIOT Act. The  Congressional Research Service actually has an analysis out. But it is not  possible to get the official interpretation  of  how  the U.S. Government  frames this law as far as the operations  are so essential for our country. The  Senator has laid it out very well. It is  a pleasure to serve with him on the Intelligence Committee.  Mr. President, let me sum up with  what this issue has come down to, to  me.  These are dangerous times. If you go  into the Intelligence Committee several times a week, as Senator UDALL  and I do, you come away with the indisputable  judgment  that  there are  threats to the well-being of this country, that there are people who do not  wish our citizens well. In these dangerous times, the sources and methods  of our antiterror operations absolutely  must be kept secret. That  is  fundamental to the work of the intelligence  community—keeping the sources and  methods of those who serve us so gallantly secret and ensuring that they  are as safe as possible.  But while we protect those sources  and methods, the laws that authorize  them should not be kept secret from  the American people. That is what this  is all about—whether the laws that authorize the operations that are so essential, which have been passed by the  Congress—that  their  interpretation  should be kept secret from the American people. I call it ‘‘secret law.’’ I  want to say to this body, yes, we need  secret operations, but secret law is bad  for our democracy. It will undermine  the confidence  the American people  have in our intelligence operations.  You might recall that it was only a  few years ago, during the Bush administration, that they secretly reinterpreted  the warrantless wiretapping  statutes to say that it was possible to  wiretap our people without a warrant.  When it came out, it took years to sort  that out, with the executive branch  and the Congress working together. I  don’t want to see that happen again. So  that  is why  I have  joined Senator  in these amendments, and we  hope we can get bipartisan support for  what we are trying to do and especially  ensure that the official interpretation  of the PATRIOT Act, an important intelligent statute, is made public to the  American people, and I think it can be  done in a way without jeopardizing our  sources and methods.  One of the reasons Senator UDALL, I,  and others feel so strongly about this  is—and Senator UDALL touched  on  this—that this is a time when Congress  should finally say we are not just going  to keep kicking the can down the road.  That is what has been done again and  again over the last decade. The PATRIOT Act was passed a decade ago,  during a period of understandable fear,  having  suffered  in  our Nation  the  greatest terrorist attack  in our history. So the PATRIOT Act was born  out of those great fears.  It seems to me that now is the time  to revisit that and ensure that a better  job is done of striking the balance between  fighting terror and protecting  individual  liberty.  Unfortunately,  every time over the last decade there  has been an effort to do just that—reUDALL visit this and strike a better balance—  we have had the same pattern; we have  said we just have to get it done quickly  and we really don’t have any time to  consider, for example, the thoughtful  ideas Senator UDALLhas mentioned. I  just don’t think it is time now to once  again put off a real debate on the PATRIOT Act for yet another always-distant day.  There is an irony about what this is  all about, and that is that Senators are  going to want to consider the amendments of Senator UDALL—and I believe  Senator PAUL is here, and others who  care strongly about this. It is awfully  hard to have a thoughtful debate on  these specific amendments, whether it  is  the Leahy amendment,  the Paul  amendment, the Udall amendment, or  the ones we have together, if, in fact,  you cannot figure out how the executive branch is interpreting the law.  An open and informed debate on the  PATRIOT Act requires that we get beyond  the  fact  that  the  executive  branch relies on the secret legal interpretations to support their work, and  Members of the Senate try to figure  out what those interpretations are.  Here are the rules. If a U.S. Senator  wants to go to the Intelligence Committee—and  I  think Senator UDALL  touched on this—the Senator can go  there and get a briefing. Many Members of Congress, however, don’t have  staff members who are  cleared  for  those kinds of briefings. Under Senate  rules, it is not possible for Senators to  come down here and discuss what they  may have picked up in one of those  classified briefings.  I just don’t think, with respect to the  legal interpretation, that is what the  American people believe we ought to be  doing. The American people want secret operations protected. They understand what sources and methods are all  about and that we have to have secrecy, for example, for those in the intelligence community to get the information we need about sleeper cells and  terrorist groups and threats we learn  about in the Intelligence Committee.  But that is very different from keeping  these legal interpretations secret.  In my view, the current situation is  simply unacceptable. The American  people recognize that their government  can better protect national security if  it sometimes is allowed to operate in  secrecy. They certainly don’t expect  the executive branch to publish every  detail about how intelligence is collected. Certainly, Americans never expected George Washington to tell them  about his plans  for observing  troop  movement at Yorktown. But Americans have always expected their government to operate within the boundaries of publicly understood  law. As  voters, they certainly have a right to  know how the law is being interpreted  so that the American people can ratify  or reject decisions made on their behalf. To put it another way, Americans  know their government will sometimes  conduct  secret operations, but  they  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:59 Feb 24, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S24MY1.REC S24MY1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011
1042,85,2011-05-24,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, today I  am pleased to recognize a community  in North Dakota that is celebrating its  125th anniversary. From June 24 to 26,  the  residents of Cogswell, ND, will  gather to celebrate their community’s  founding.  Cogswell townsite was founded at the  junction of the Soo Line Railroad and  the Milwaukee Road Railroad. Some  believe it was named for a Soo Line  Railroad official, while others say it  was named for MAJ Thomas Cogswell,  a Revolutionary War hero.  Located in Sargent County, the citizens of Cogswell are proud to mention  the many reasons their community is  so  strong. The  city  offers  genuine  smalltown living with a post office, bar  and grill, repair stores, and construction companies. The people of Cogswell  are known for their exceptional work  ethic and caring attitude toward others, making it a great place to live and  raise a family.  In honor of the city’s 125th anniversary, community  leaders have organized an all-school reunion, school reunion supper, street dances, a parade,  5K run/walk, games, classic car show,  quilt  show,  talent  show, and other  celebratory events.  I ask that my colleagues in the U.S.  Senate  join me  in  congratulating  Cogswell, ND, and its residents on their  first 125 years and in wishing them well  in the  future. By honoring Cogswell  and all other historic small towns of  North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future  generations.  It  is  places  such  as  Cogswell that have helped shape this  country into what it is today, which is  why this fine community is deserving  of our recognition.  Cogswell has a proud past and a  bright future.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE  At 10:13 a.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Mrs. Cole, announced that the House  has passed the following bills, in which  it requests the concurrence of the Senate:  H.R. 1383.

1056,106,2011-05-24,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I do not  believe small businesses need government assistance to exist. In fact, I believe the best thing our government  can do is to shrink the size and cost of  the Federal Government. With  less  government, minimal Federal regulation, and lower taxes, businesses—regardless of size,  industry, and  location—will innovate in meeting American consumer demands and achieve  phenomenal growth.  Instead of encouraging dependence on  the Federal Government, I believe politicians should seek to find ways to free  businesses to thrive independently. Additionally, with a national debt of almost  $14.3  trillion, Congress  should  start considering ways to enable sustainable economic growth  instead of  authorizing or increasing more Federal  subsidy programs that more often than  not have limited or questionable benefits.  As a former small and large business  owner, I know the struggles small businesses face because of unnecessary government regulations and taxes. In fact,  the Federal Government’s interference  in my ability  to practice medicine  prompted me to first seek office. Small  businesses are invaluable to the economic health of our great country and  embody the American dream.  While I join the Senate and the President in recognizing the contributions  of small businesses all over the country, I would like to join Senator PAUL  in opposing a resolution passed by the  Senate today that  lauds big government and the use of taxpayer dollars to  subsidize certain small businesses.

1057,106,2011-05-24,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. President, I was a  small businessman before I was elected  to the Senate. I know well the struggles small businesses face because of  government regulations and taxes.  I  also know that small businesses are a  key driver of economic growth and employment. That is why I join the Senate and the President in recognizing  the contributions of small businesses  all over the country during National  Small Business Week.  Unfortunately, this resolution goes a  step  beyond  recognizing  the  hard-  working  entrepreneurs who are our  small businessmen and businesswomen.  The resolution also praises big government and using taxpayer dollars to  subsidize small businesses. I do not believe small businesses need government  assistance to exist. I do not believe we  need an entire agency of the Federal  Government  to  encourage  entrepreneurs. Quite the opposite—I believe  that with less government, businesses  of all sizes will be created, existing  businesses will grow, and the American  spirit will thrive. That is why I voted  against this resolution.  ",2011

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON  OFTHEDISTRICTOFCOLUMBIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 24, 2011  ",2011
1063,113,2011-05-24,Ms. NORTON.," Mr. Speaker, today, in honor  of National Preservation Month, I rise to reintroduce the National Mall Revitalization and  Designation Act. The National Mall is Washington’s most neglected and underutilized federal property, despite being so well-known and  treasured. The Mall lacks everything that this  majestic natural wonder deserves, from an official identity to basic amenities. My bill authorizes  the National Capital Planning Commission, NCPC, to expand the boundaries of the  Mall where commemorative works may be located, requires NCPC to study the commemorative works process, and requires  the Secretary of the Interior to submit a plan to Congress to enhance visitor enjoyment, amenities  and cultural experiences in, and the vitality of,  the Mall within 180 days.  I worked closely with NCPC and other agencies  in drafting  the bill. The bill would give  NCPC the responsibility and necessary flexibility to designate the Mall area for commemorative works for the first time and to expand  the Mall area  for  that purpose when appropriate. The bill requires NCPC to accommodate future commemorative works and cultural  institutions. Tourists and workers downtown  should be able to walk to the Mall and hear  terrific music and other entertainment,  from  string quartets  to poetry  readings, perhaps  during lunch at attractive tables where good—  not  fast—food  is available. Residents of  the  city and region should be able to find space  for fun and games beyond the cramped space  between Third Street and the Lincoln Memorial.  Bordered by world-class cultural institutions,  the Mall itself has been reduced to a lawn with  a few—too few—ordinary benches and a couple of fast food stands. The Mall needs a total  makeover for the 21st century that would be  worthy of Pierre L’Enfant’s vision for the city  he planned and the McMillan plan, which is  largely  responsible  for what  is  referred  to  today as  the Mall—the space between  the  Capitol and  the Lincoln Memorial.  In writing  the bill,  I  recognized  that  the  federal  funds  needed to make the Mall the 21st century destination it should be will not be forthcoming in  this  fiscal  climate. Nevertheless, we must  move now  to begin  to  rescue  this space,  which has been damaged by heavy use and  is often used by pedestrians as no more than  a  throughway, despite  its magnificent potential. With  the necessary  imagination, making  the Mall an  inviting place with cultural and  other amenities is achievable now.  The NCPC is well on its way to meeting the  bill’s requirement for an expansive, 21st century definition of the Mall. Frustrated by continually  fighting off proposals  for new monuments, museums, and memorials on  the already crowded Mall space, I asked the NCPC  to devise a mall presentation plan. In 2003,  Congress  amended  the  Commemorative  Works Act  to create a reserve area—a no-  build zone where new memorials may not be  built. This action was helpful in quelling some  but by no means all of  the demand  from  groups  for  placement  of  commemorative  works on what they view as the Mall.  Recognizing the need for more commemorative works sites, NCPC and the Commission  on Fine Arts, CFA, released a National Capital  Framework Plan in 2009, which identifies sites  near the Mall that are suitable for new commemorative works,  including East Potomac  Park, the Kennedy Center Plaza, and the new  South Capitol gateway. Five new prestigious  memorials are scheduled  for such sites,  including the Eisenhower Memorial and the U.S.  Air Force Memorial.  I appreciate  that NCPC  and the CFA work closely with the District of  Columbia in designating off-Mall sites for new  monuments. The District welcomes  the expanded Mall into our local neighborhoods to  increase the number of tourists that visit them,  enhancing the work of the District of Columbia  government and the local organizations such  as Cultural Tourism that offer tours of historic  District neighborhoods. The off-Mall sites  for  monuments also complement development of  entire new neighborhoods near the Mall, particularly  the District’s  redevelopment of  the  Southwest Waterfront and work on The Yards,  which, under my bill, now  includes a waterfront park and eventually will include a mixed-  use public-private development.  The Mall Revitalization and Designation Act  is the first step in an effort to focus Congress  on finally giving the Mall its due after decades  of neglect and indifference. The bill starts at  the beginning—expanding what we mean by  the Mall, and taking the first steps to breathe  life into a space that is meant for people to  enjoy.  f  HONORING PATRICIA A. MAYO  HON.

1065,3,2011-06-01,Mr. PIERLUISI.," Mr. Speaker,  the  2010 census confirmed that Hispanics  are a growing part of the American  family. There are now more than 50  million Latinos in the United States,  accounting for more than half of the  Nation’s population growth between  2000 and 2010. Today, one in six Americans is Hispanic.  This tremendous growth adds to our  country’s rich diversity, but  it also  brings  challenges.  The  number  of  English language learners in our Nation’s schools has increased by 50 percent over  the past decade. English  learners are found in States with traditionally  large Hispanic  populations,  like Texas and New Mexico, and  in  States that have experienced a recent  influx of  immigrants,  like Colorado  and Indiana. And English learners are  found in large numbers in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico.  How well our schools educate those  students will determine the future success of our Nation. And providing a  quality education means ensuring that  they graduate from high school with  proficiency in English. The benefits of  learning English are clear for students  living in the 50 States where it is difficult  to obtain most  jobs without  being fluent in the language.  But learning English is also vital for  students in Puerto Rico. In my life I  have visited many countries around  the world; and everywhere I have traveled, I have seen young people studying  English with passion and determination. Puerto Rico’s sons and daughters,  particularly as American citizens living in a U.S. territory, simply must be  proficient in English to compete effectively in the modern globalized world.  Yet for too many years, some politicians in Puerto Rico sought to limit  the teaching of English in our local  schools in a misguided effort to influence the debate over Puerto Rico’s political status. This cynical approach  has harmed our children and our island. Regardless  of  one’s  views  on  Puerto Rico’s status, there can be no  question that proficiency in English, as  well as in Spanish, is in the best interest of Puerto Rico’s youth. To deny our  children  the  opportunity  to  learn  English is to deny them the countless  opportunities that come with being bilingual.  Accordingly, since arriving in Congress, one of my primary goals has  been to improve English language instruction in Puerto Rico schools. That  is why I have introduced a bill to raise  a cap that restricts the amount of Federal  funds the  island can receive to  strengthen  its English  language programs. In order to ensure that the children of Puerto Rico have the same opportunities as children in the States, it  is imperative that the island be treated  fairly when it comes to allocating Federal funding for English language programs.  Moreover,  our  schools’  success  in  teaching English  learners  in Puerto  Rico and in the States will depend on  the number of well-prepared bilingual  teachers available  to  instruct  these  students. In Puerto Rico the challenge  has been to find enough teachers who  are sufficiently proficient in English to  effectively teach the language. At the  same time, the  increased number of  English learners in the States has left  school  districts  scrambling  to  find  enough teachers who are fluent in foreign languages, such as Spanish and  Mandarin, as well as in English.  In both cases,  schools are asking  themselves, How can I find an experienced teacher to meet this need? One  answer: teacher exchanges.  I recently introduced legislation that  would fund teacher exchanges between  school districts in different regions of  the United States. Under my bill, for  example, a  teacher  in Puerto Rico  could improve her English ability by  spending a year in the States trading  places with a native English-speaking  instructor who seeks to improve her  Spanish language skills. Through this  exchange the teachers and, more importantly, the students in each community would benefit. No wonder that  organizations  representing  English  teachers, foreign language instructors,  principals, and school boards have all  endorsed my bill.  b1020  As Congress works to reform the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,  I urge my colleagues to address the  needs of English  language  learners,  whether those students are located in  Santa Fe, San Antonio, or San Juan.  Our goal should be as simple as it is  ambitious: to ensure that every student in our Nation has the opportunity  to graduate from high school as a fluent English speaker.  f  BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT  ",2011
1066,3,2011-06-01,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) for 5 minutes.  ,2011
1067,3,2011-06-01,Mr. DEFAZIO.," Well, yesterday the  House resoundingly rejected a so-called  ‘‘clean’’ increase in the debt limit, as it  should have. But different people are  going  to draw different  conclusions  from this vote. The Republicans will  say  this means unlimited  spending  cuts, that’s how we’ll balance the budget. And on my side of the aisle, there  will be those who say this puts revenues back  into play. Actually, both  should be right.  There is no way, no way to deal with  a  $1.7  trillion deficit—I guess we’re  down to $1.4 trillion this year; money  is coming in a little better than expected—to deal with that without dealing with both sides of the equation,  that is, revenues and cuts in spending.  Now, unfortunately, around here it  seems that coming together  for the  problems of the Nation is somewhat  quaint and old fashioned. I’ve been here  long enough to remember when we used  to do those things, when we had the  surtax on millionaires back when Bush  I was President and brought back some  fiscal  sanity, before my  time when  Ronald Reagan  raised  taxes  three  times because he realized that supply-  side economics didn’t work. Well, we’re  now  back  to  supply-side  economics  over here. It doesn’t work. And more  tax cuts, they’re proposing more tax  cuts in the face of deficit. Absurd.  So how are we going to force that  discussion? I believe we need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We actually passed one when  I was here in 1995. I voted for it. It  failed by one vote in the Senate. Now,  just  think, had  that been  in place  when, in the last 2 years of the Clinton  Presidency, we not only balanced the  budget, we began to pay down debt for  the first time since 1969. Then came  Bush II, and he said we’re going to give  that money back to the people. And  even when we went  into deficit, he  said, well, we need more  tax cuts.  That’s what we need is more tax cuts,  because we’re running a deficit now  and that’s how you deal with deficits is  to cut taxes because then people will—  whatever. Somehow that creates more  money.  If we had had the balanced  budget amendment to the Constitution  in place, Bush couldn’t have gotten  away with  that. He  couldn’t  have  launched an unnecessary war in Iraq  and cut taxes at the same time; the  first time our Nation has gone to war  while cutting taxes. And he managed  to double the debt in 8 short years,  ending with the spectacular crash on  Wall Street and  the TARP bailout,  which many forget was the Bush TARP  bailout—I voted against that, too—not  the Obama bailout; although Obama  continued  those  same Wall  Street  friendly policies, to his discredit.  And then the Obama stimulus. Forty  percent of that was Bush tax cuts.  What is it? What is it we don’t get that  cutting taxes in the way that George  Bush wanted to do and did do with  trickle-down economics and piling up  more debt does not put people back to  work? It’s not investment. It doesn’t  generate economic activity and jobs.  The theory  is, oh, the rich people  have so much money, they’ll invest it  in meaningful ways. Corporations are  sitting on  $2  trillion  in cash. Wall  Street billionaire hedge fund managers  pay a 15 percent rate of tax, half that  of an Army captain. Are they investing  in a meaningful way to put people back  to work? No. They’re speculating and  driving up the price of gas and screwing the American people and depressing  the economy.  It’s time to get real around here. I  believe a balanced budget amendment  would focus the minds and deal with  this deficit and debt in a way that is  serious, both with dealing with revenues and dealing with spending cuts.

1072,10,2011-06-01,Mr. REED.," Mr. Speaker, the question  before the House is: Should the House  now consider House Resolution 287?  While  the  resolution  waives  all  points of order against consideration of  the bill, the committee is not aware of  any points of order. The waiver is prophylactic in nature. Specifically, the  Committee on Rules is not aware of  any violation of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act nor has the Congressional Budget Office notified the Rules  Committee of any violation of the act.  Additionally, the open rule before the  House  today allows any Member of  Congress to amend or strike any provision of the bill, which is the ultimate  failsafe.  In order to allow the House to continue  its scheduled business  for the  day, I urge Members to vote ‘‘yes’’ on  the question of consideration of the  resolution.  I reserve the balance of my time.

1074,10,2011-06-01,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," There is a lot of  talk and legalese about what is going  on today, but the reality is what the  Republicans are trying to do underneath all of that legalese language is to  enshrine in law the Republican Ryan  budget. By voting for the rule, what  you do is to put into force that budget.  What does that budget do? It ends  Medicare.  Now, there are people who resent  that term—that oh, no, we’re really  going to save it. Well, I’m going to tell  you, when you take away the guaranteed benefits of Medicare—that’s what  seniors get right now—for people 55 and  under, they are thrown into the not-so-  loving arms of the insurance companies, and their costs will increase out  of their own pockets by about $6,000.  That’s what the bill does.  The bill also turns Medicaid upside  down, which is not only the health care  plan for poor children in the United  States but also the largest payer for  nursing homes and home health care.  That is the single biggest part of Medicaid—paying  for nursing home care  and home health care. So it’s another  slap at the seniors.  The other thing that the legislation  does is to offer more tax breaks for the  wealthiest Americans. It lowers the tax  rates for corporation, many of which  aren’t even paying any  taxes  right  now, a couple of which got tax refunds  from  the  government.  You’ve  got  major companies paying  fewer taxes  than ordinary Americans. That’s what  this does.  ",2011

1079,10,2011-06-01,Mr. ELLISON.," I yield myself the remaining time.  Mr. Speaker, we should be creating  jobs,  not  destroying Medicare. We  should be preserving what has made  America great, which is the basic sense  that we are all in this thing together.  Yes, it is absolutely true that people  should go out into the private sector  and try their luck in the free market—  skill,  ingenuity  and  all  that—but  America has always had a strong public sector, which has been essential to  the survival and the success of that  private sector: fair rules, good infrastructure, good jobs, times in America,  like during the Depression, when Eisenhower led us to build and create  that infrastructure. Then in 1968, when  we created Medicare, this country has  been at its best. Yes, a private sector  but also a strong, vibrant public sector.  We are at a point in American history today when at least the Republican caucus believes we don’t need a  public sector. We just don’t need one.  We may need one, maybe, for military  stuff, but beyond that, they just don’t  see a purpose for it. I believe Americans think that things like Medicare,  infrastructure development, Social Security, and things like the GI Bill are  important parts of what make America  ‘‘America’’ because they are how we  recognize as Americans that we are all  in this thing together, that our senior  citizens will not be abandoned, that  our GIs coming back will not be left behind, that communities which need police, fire and EMT services will not just  be left to the ravages of others.  We need an American commitment  to Social Security and Medicare, and  that’s what we’re going to be arguing  for today. The American people can  count on the Democratic Caucus to  never abandon our seniors even as Republicans want to take Medicare apart  as a program that has served so many  people so well. You want to do something to change Medicare? Why don’t  we let Medicare negotiate drug prices.  That could probably save us several  billion dollars a year, as much as $53  billion a year. Republicans don’t want  to do that because they’ve got their interests to protect.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

Yet,  in response to the comments  that have been tendered by my colleagues from the other side of the aisle,  I would say that Republicans are not  here to destroy Medicare. They are  here to save Medicare.  We have put forth a responsible plan  that has been openly and continuously  debated in the public forum and in this  Chamber about how we’re going  to  move forward with the problem that we  have in Medicare. It is a problem we  cannot deny. Both sides of the aisle  know that Medicare is on a path to  bankruptcy. We have put forth a plan.  We have put forth a plan that guarantees that we can deal with the problem  in such a way that those who are on  Medicare are not  impacted and that  those within a generation of retiring  into Medicare are not impacted. Yet  we’re villainized by the other side for  allegedly  throwing grandma off  the  cliff—for taking away Medicare.  b1250  That is not being honest with the  American public. We will be honest  with the American public. We recognize the problem in Medicare. We put  forth a plan.

I cannot sit and not rise and object  and ask everyone in this body: Please  let’s identify limits to what we will say  and where we will go, because what we  say here the world listens to; but more  importantly, the God that we pray to  listens, too.

Today, we consider this rule and the  Homeland  Security’s  appropriations  bill where you actually cut 60 percent  of the moneys that the Federal Government sends to our  local cities—yes,  those cities that are struggling, those  cities that protect us. We don’t protect  the American people from the Capitol.  It’s  the  local  law enforcement,  the  local fire department, the local hospitals. If a terrorist attack or a natural  disaster happens, the local responders  are the ones who first help the American people, and you’re cutting  the  money. They’re already under attack  at the local level. They have already  let firemen and policemen go, and now  you’re taking away 60 percent of the  moneys that we send to protect the  American people.

The Democratic Congresswoman-  elect hails from the most Republican  district in my State, a district that  JOHNMCCAINwon in 2008.  Just one week ago, voters in her conservative-leaning district resoundingly  rejected the Republican plan to end  Medicare. Apparently, the Republican  majority here in Washington didn’t get  the message. Voting to end Medicare  once was not enough for them. The rule  vote that we are about to take will,  once again, deem the Ryan plan to end  Medicare as enacted and will put us on  a road to ruin where seniors will see  out-of-pocket expenses skyrocket by at  least $6,000 every year as Medicare is  ended so as to continue the handouts of  tens of billions of dollars to oil companies.  In a few moments, after they’ve finished voting to end Medicare again, I  hope that as my Republican colleagues  congratulate our New York colleague  on her election they will see her as yet  another face and as yet another voice,  an outspoken voice, to save Medicare.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the rule, which will end Medicare as we  know it, and also to the underlying  bill, which reduces Homeland Security  grants by 50 percent to our cities, to  our ports, to our transit.  Is there any reason to believe, I ask  my Republican colleagues, that there  is a 50 percent reduction in threat?  If anything, law enforcement tells us  that the number of threats is up since  the death of Osama bin Laden. Police  Commissioner Kelly, in New York City,  tells me that since 9/11 there have been  13 serious terrorist attempts, and six of  these were  focused on mass transit,  which has been cut by 50 percent.  We need to remember what law enforcement  has  told  us:  that  our  antiterrorist efforts have to be right  every day, every hour, every second,  every time. Yet terrorists just have to  be lucky once.  I  ask my Republican  colleagues:  What would be the impact on the loss  of lives and on our economy if we were  attacked again as they are trying to  do? The chatter is up. Law enforcement  tells us the threat is up, not down. So  why are we cutting it 50 percent?  b1410  My Republican colleagues, I say to  you that you are not just gambling  with dollars; you are gambling with  lives.

Now, that might come as a  surprise to many who are watching  this debate, or to the Speaker or anyone else in this Chamber today, that  we are actually debating a rule that  deals with homeland security.  Now, the fantasy discussion going on  on the left right now on any topic that  comes to mind might be entertaining  to some, but for the rest of this country, they would love to see this body  actually  debate  issues  that  are  on  topic, and that issue is homeland security. Agencies like Border Patrol, ICE  agents, Coast Guard personnel, the Secret Service, funding for all sorts of  agencies, $1 billion for FEMA disaster  relief fund, are these not issues important enough to discuss on the  floor  today?  The bill prohibits the use of funds to  move detainees at Guantanamo Bay,  Cuba, into the United States and denies them immigration benefits such as  visas,  admission  into  the  United  States, and classification as refugees,  all sorts of things that are critical to  homeland  security,  to  protecting  Americans  from  terrorism,  keeping  Americans safe.  And we are doing it under an open  rule, and that is the issue on this rule  debate.

1099,24,2011-06-01,Mr. ADERHOLT.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  It is my honor to present the fiscal  year 2012 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security.  This bill before us today, perhaps  more than any other bill, exemplifies  the difficult choices that need to be  made in order to address our Nation’s  fiscal crisis.  This bill demonstrates how we can  fully  fund  vital  security  programs  while also reducing spending overall.  Furthermore, this bill does not represent a false choice between fiscal responsibility and security. Both are national security priorities, and both are  vigorously addressed in this bill.  I am under no illusion that everyone  here in this Chamber will agree with  the  spending  reductions  included  in  this legislation; but now, more than  ever, our government needs fiscal discipline, and this bill takes the necessary steps toward that goal.  The bottom  line: more money and  more government do not equal more security. So in this time of skyrocketing  debt and persistent threats, we must  get our homeland security priorities  right.  The bill before us today provides $40.6  billion in discretionary funding, or almost  $3 billion, which  is  7 percent  below the request, and $1.1 billion, or  almost 3 percent below the fiscal year  2011 level. In addition, the bill also includes $1 billion in offset, emergency  supplemental funding for FEMA’s disaster relief fund immediately upon enactment. There are no earmarks that  are set out in this bill or the accompanying report.  The bill places priority on funding  our Nation’s greatest security needs—  fully  funding all  frontline personnel  such as Border Patrol, CBP officers,  ICE officers, Coast Guard military personnel, and Secret Service agents, and  fully  funding  all  intelligence,  watchlisting,  and  threat  targeting  functions.  In addition, the bill provides funding  where the administration and the Department of Homeland Security have  failed. This bill makes up for the nearly $650 million shortfall handed to us  by the Department through phony, unauthorized fee collections. It is irresponsible  for  the  administration  to  submit a budget based on the illusion  that Congress is going to raise taxes or  fees in this current economy.  This bill also addresses the wholly inadequate  request  for  disaster  relief  funding and provides the resources to  help our  communities  recover  from  natural disasters,  like  the unprecedented flooding across the Mississippi  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:28 Jun 02, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A01JN7.011 H01JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 D K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2011

1101,31,2011-06-01,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  to  support  the  LaTourette-Pascrell amendment, and I  too recognize the challenges that Mr.  ADERHOLTand Mr. PRICE faced in the  confines of trying to address some difficult times. But as a Member of the  Homeland Security Committee, I believe it is imperative that we look at  the reality of the world in which we  live. In an article dated April 24, 2011,  out of the State of Texas, reads: hundreds of weary firefighters were racing  against the clock on Sunday, pushing  back massive brush fires that have destroyed near-record swatches of Texas  countryside. Firefighters were hoping  to make as much progress as possible  before low humidity and strong winds  set the stage for more potential flare-  ups late Monday and Tuesday.  Fires were still burning  in Texas.  Firefighters are still being called upon.  Cities and States across America are  laying off firefighters. And we are reminded of the needs, if you will, that  were addressed on 9/11 when firefighters  from the City of New York rushed in to  save their fellow New Yorkers and others, and many of them, many of them  perished.  They are, in fact, first responders.  And I believe it is important that we  make the sacrifice, we find the adequate  offset,  and we  support  this  amendment.  I’m also reminded of a  story  that many of you may have  heard, the sad story, it aired on local  television,  where  firefighters  from  some  locality watched while a man  drowned and could not save him. The  reasoning was that the particular team  that would have had the skills and the  equipment to save this drowning man  in what has been called the most powerful Nation in the world, was fired,  laid off, eliminated. And,  therefore,  from the shoreline many looked in horror as this particular man drowned.  Is this what America has come to?  I  believe  this  amendment  is  extremely important, one, to be able to  show appreciation to the firefighters  across America who come to the aid of  those  in need  from different States  when a crisis or tragedy occurs.  I heard someone mention, it might  have been Mr. LATOURETTE, but who is  it that plucks you out of a burning  house or rescues, when they do have  the resources or the team, out of a predicament where you are stranded  in  some crisis, whether  it  is drowning,  whether it’s a fire, whether it is an  emergency health condition or whether  or not they are confronting a terrorist  act? Firefighters are truly our first responders.  In the City of Houston they are considering closing out or shutting down  600-plus police officers. And firefighters  have the same concerns.  So I think it is very important that  we own up to our duties. And as I mentioned in a metaphor before, let the  American people be winners today. Let  the  firefighters be present and accounted for. And let us be reminded of  their great heroic acts of 9/11. This 10th  year anniversary, let us not say thank  you  in the way that we deny them  funding, but let us say thank you in  the way that we provide them with the  funding that they need.  I ask my colleagues to support this  amendment.  ",2011

1105,38,2011-06-01,Mr. BROUN of Georgia.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my amendment to H.R. 2017. My amendment simply cuts $600,000 from the Office of the  Under Secretary in the Department of  Homeland Security and places those  funds in the deficit reduction account.  During this economic emergency, we  must find cuts wherever we can, especially when a Department is not being  a good steward of the funding that Congress provides it.  If you look at this bill, the Secretary  is being allocated nearly $127 million,  of which $6 million goes to the Office of  Legislative Affairs. I think the American people would agree with me that  $6 million is a lot of money for political appointees who refuse to do their  job and participate  in the oversight  process.  On several occasions this year, Mr.  Chairman, the Department has either  refused to sit on the same panel as  other witnesses or has outright refused  to appear before various House committees and subcommittees. In fact, as  chairman of the House Science Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, I held a hearing on behavioral  science and security with the goal of  understanding how  science  informed  the development of TSA’s SPOT program.  b1720  The Department refused my request  for a witness from TSA for their own  program, and I’m not the only chairman who has received such shabby and  unacceptable treatment. This pattern  of arrogance makes fulfilling our oversight responsibilities of the executive  branch very difficult, if not impossible.  In the end, it’s the American people,  Mr. Chairman, who lose if its government cannot perform  its most basic  constitutional responsibilities.  If the  Department is not going to meet its  obligations of appearing before Congress when requested, it is prudent to  apply the funds rescinded in this, my  amendment, to more constructive uses  such as reducing our deficit.  If 10 percent is good enough for the  Lord, I think the Office of Legislative  Affairs can part with 10 percent of  their funding to aid in our efforts of reducing the burden of debt on our children and grandchildren.  I can think of no higher priority than  reducing the deficit and creating jobs  in America. I would urge all of my colleagues  to  support  this amendment  today.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

And  the bill already cuts $4,993,000 off of the  fiscal year 2011 level for the Office of  Under Secretary for Management; and  it cuts $14,118,000 off of the administration’s request.  Now, Mr. Chairman, I know this is an  easy  target. Who knows even what  under Secretary for Management does.  It’s a very common technique around  here to go after these accounts, these  administrative  and  front  office  accounts, just for the sake of cutting or  maybe to pay for something else that  sounds good. But  I don’t think  it’s  wise. I don’t think it’s responsible. And  I would urge rejection of the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR.

1108,38,2011-06-01,Mr. POE of Texas.," I thank the Chairman.  This amendment takes $10 million  from the Office of the Under Secretary  for Management of DHS and moves it  to the Border, Security, Fencing, Infrastructure,  and  Technology  account  with the purpose of being used for border cell phone communications to help  border residents disseminate border security-related  information  to Border  Patrol and  law enforcement  for the  protection of their lives and our border.  I appreciate the support of Congressfrom Pennsylvania  in  this bipartisan amendment.  This amendment really is the idea of  Congresswoman GABBYGIFFORDS from  Arizona. After having been to the border of Arizona with her staff, I learned  firsthand the problems that not only  Texas and other States but Arizona  specifically has with communication  when ranchers are on their property.  On March  27,  2010,  rancher Bob  Krentz of Arizona was murdered  20  miles north of the border from Mexico  in an isolated area of Arizona. The lack  of  communications  capability made  Krentz more vulnerable than he would  have been otherwise and complicated  the search for the assailants. His wife  believes it was in a cell phone dead  zone where he was killed and that he  was trying to call for help, but his cell  phone would not work.  Since that time, Congresswoman GIFFORDShas been working diligently on  this issue, and I have had the opportunity to work with her on other border security issues as well as this one.  These dead zones are so common that  often times border ranchers in Arizona  and Texas rely on shortwave radios to  communicate and call for help when  they are in trouble or they see illegal  crossings into their property.  The inability of the U.S. Government  to secure the U.S.-Mexico border creates public safety hazards for residents  of border areas and the law enforcement agents who patrol them. Many  border areas are rural and lack wireless  communication capabilities like phone  service, and they exacerbate the border-related public safety concern.  Once again, I want to thank Congresswoman GIFFORDSand her staff for  this legislation.  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.  ",2011

1112,59,2011-06-01,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  today in support of the amendment offered by my colleague regarding UASI.  This amendment will better ensure  that all cities and localities will be eligible  for critical UASI  funding, not  just those under the arbitrary caps  that are in the underlying bill.  UASI funding is critical to my district of Sacramento, California, and a  number of other major American cities. It has helped create and develop  one of the Nation’s foremost counterterrorism and readiness task forces located at  the  former McClellan Air  Force Base in my district. This facility  has greatly enhanced the collaboration  and  communication  amongst  local,  State, and Federal  law enforcement  agencies and  first  responders. From  there, officials are better able to prevent attacks by training, sharing information,  and  coordinating  investigations. And in the unthinkable scenario  in which an attack does occur, this facility, funded by UASI dollars, will better able the region’s law enforcement  and first responders to react and respond to an attack.

1113,73,2011-06-01,Mr. ISSA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  the distinguished career of Sergeant Major  Jeffrey H. Dixon on the occasion of his retirement from the United States Marine Corps. I  offer SgtMaj Dixon my sincerest thanks for his  33 years of dedicated service in protecting our  nation and safeguarding its future.  SgtMaj Dixon  joined  the Marine Corps  in  1978 at Parris Island, South Carolina. On four  separate occasions, SgtMaj Dixon was meritoriously promoted through the ranks with participation in the evacuation of a U.S. embassy,  the Palestine  Liberation Organization,  and  subsequent combat operations in Beirut, Lebanon—all within the first five years of his career.  In 1983, SgtMaj Dixon reported to 2/1 and  completed a deployment as a Platoon Sergeant to Okinawa, Japan as well as a western  pacific deployment. During  this  tour, SgtMaj  Dixon’s exceptional skills were set apart when  his squad won the First Marines Rifle Squad  competition. Shortly  following, SgtMaj Dixon  was selected along with nine other Marines to  form what became the Combat Assault Training Section where he designed and instructed  multiple courses that are utilized to this day.  SgtMaj Dixon’s additional tours of duty include Operation Desert Shield and Desert  Storm,  the 11th and 15th MEU, Operations  Desert Thunder and Desert Fox, Task Force  58 in Afghanistan and Operation Iraq Freedom  I & II. Throughout these deployments, SgtMaj  Dixon distinguished himself by extraordinary  acts of leadership time and again. Among his  many accomplishments, his decorations  include Meritorious Service Medals, a Navy  Commendation Medal,  Navy  Achievement  Medals and a Combat Action Ribbon. These  recognitions are a  true  testament of SgtMaj  Dixon’s dedication,  leadership and commitment to our country.  In 2007 SgtMaj Dixon was assigned as the  SgtMaj  for Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton where  in 2008, as a reflection of his  work,  the Base won  the Commander and  Chiefs  Installation Excellence award. Moreover, SgtMaj Dixon’s service in his current position as  the Sergeant Major  for  the Marine  Corps  Installations West has  truly been  the  capstone of a remarkable military career.  SgtMaj Dixon’s  demonstrated  leadership,  dedication and expertise has  inspired countless  fellow Marines As he enters  this new  stage of his life, I hope that SgtMaj Dixon will  benefit  from his years of work,  just as  the  United States Marine Corps has benefited. I  offer him my congratulations and may he  enjoy a rewarding retirement.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you to please join me in  honoring all the brave men and women who  have  served  in  the United States Armed  Forces, and the admirable service of Sergeant  Major Jeffrey Dixon.  HONORING THE ARLINGTON FOOD  ASSISTANCE  CENTER’S  (AFAC)  PERMANENT  HOME  CAPITAL  CAMPAIGN, AND KELLER WILLIAMS, ARLINGTON  HON. JAMES P. MORAN  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 1, 2011  ",2011
1114,73,2011-06-01,Mr. MORAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize the Arlington Food Assistance Center’s (AFAC) Permanent Home Capital Campaign, and Keller Williams, Arlington, both of  which are located in Virginia’s Eighth Congressional District.  AFAC’s Permanent Home Campaign was  launched in 2008. The goals of the campaign  are to pay off the mortgage of their new building, establish a capital needs fund, and pay  back AFAC’s modest endowment  fund  from  which the downpayment on the building purchase was borrowed.  The Arlington Food Assistance Center has  many generous and faithful friends who have  assisted  them  in  the campaign effort. They  have raised $760,000 so far, moving closer toward their $1 million goal.  No community partner has worked as tirelessly on  this effort as  the Community Outreach Committee of Keller Williams, Arlington.  Keller Williams has graciously hosted  fundraisers for AFAC and their Permanent Home  Campaign, and is now the largest donor to the  Campaign—having raised over $100,000 in 3  years.  I would like to commend the Arlington Food  Assistance Center for their work on behalf of  the less fortunate in Arlington County and recognize  Keller  Williams,  Arlington,  for  partnering with them in support of their Permanent Home Campaign and overall mission to  feed the hungry in our region.  f  HONORING CLEM ROY  HON. JOHN B. LARSON  OFCONNECTICUT  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 1, 2011  ",2011
1115,73,2011-06-01,Mr. LARSON.," Mr. Speaker, the passing of  Clem Roy—an old friend of mine—happened  so abruptly, and struck at the core of the notion we all have of our brief time on this planet, and the importance of friends and family,  and what we mean to one another.  Faith  teaches us  that Clem  is  in a better  place: at peace and without suffering, while  we scramble to fill the void left by his passing  with stories and memories of  the  friend we  laughed with, argued and debated with, and  with whom we shared in the ups and downs  of the human comedy that is life.  Two  Connecticut  writers—both  contemporaries of Clem’s—Kevin Rennie of The Hartford Courant, and Mark Pazniokas of the CT  Mirror, wrote excellent pieces about Clem that  I am proud to submit for the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORDat the same time that a flag will fly  over the United States Capitol in Clem Roy’s  memory. These writers captured his essence.  The  following are  the articles as  they appeared in The Hartford Courant and CT Mirror:  LOBBYISTCLEMROY: A SHARPOPERATOR  WITHALOTOFHEART  (By Kevin Rennie—The Hartford Courant)  ‘‘You can read a bill and you can vote for  a bill, but you shouldn’t do both.’’ So goes  the wisdom of an original in Connecticut politics, Clem Roy.  A lobbyist for more than 30 years, Clem  has been  struck by an aggressive brain  tumor diagnosed a few weeks ago. In those  decades bivouacking in the Capitol village,  he has fashioned a distinct, colorful legacy  in the gray world of state politics.  You could  tell  the  future by watching  Clem. He was what consumer analysts call  an early adopter. The first cellphones were  bigger than bricks. Clem made his look like  a natural accoutrement to his careful look.  Hard frame briefcases were at the end of  their run when Clem began carrying a Coach  leather backpack. He was right that keys  and a thick wallet wreck the drape of an elegant suit.  You could live by his compendium of aphorisms, which his legion of friends have been  sharing as they buck up each other’s flagging spirits. That is usually Clem’s job.  Born in 1946 and raised in Bristol, Clem  served in Vietnam from 1966 into 1967. Really  served, not just told people he did on the way  to a seat in the U.S. Senate. (Don’t get him  started on that.) He returned to the United  States and worked for Robert Kennedy’s 1968  presidential campaign.  He worked for a legislative committee in  the late 1970s and then, without a client, became a lobbyist. His foresight expanded beyond technology and  fashion.  In 1981, he  managed Thurman Milner’s successful campaign for mayor of Hartford, helping Milner  become the first black mayor of a New England city.  For more than 30 years, Clem has been a  source of pungent opinions, smart insights  and surprises. He represented tobacco companies at a time when the same people who  gasped at the lighting of a cigarette supported making taxpayers give drug addicts  free needles. He brought a sense of proportion  to human weakness  in  its  struggle  against tiresome Utopians.  He has had many clients and he can argue  most briefs. He knows how to create a diversion that unbalances an adversary on one  issue while working with them on a different  one. In a place where a governor’s repetitive  green ties pass for fashion, Clem Roy does it  all with high style, often purchased from  swank Louis, Boston.  Lobbying has been good to Clem. He can  employ a gruff demeanor and a memory for  slights (not the worst thing), but he has a secret. Shouldn’t everyone? He is a secret Samaritan.  When a friend was celebrating a milestone  and her newly married daughter could not  afford to fly to Connecticut from California,  Clem bought her a ticket so she could surprise her mother. The halls of government  and Hartford Hospital, where he now is, reverberate with such stories.  Clem believes mixing in mannered company can help lift one’s lot. A few years ago,  he sent the residents of a women’s shelter to  a salon, told them to get dolled up and had  them to delivered to his favorite haunt, Max  Downtown. There,  compliments  of Clem,  they learned about what was once called deportment while the staff raised their spirits  and enriched their knowledge of another part  of the world.  A successful lobbyist needs a vigilant eye  for detail and relentless  focus. Clem possesses those attributes and his perceptions  extend beyond the matter of the moment. He  had an urge to lift in ways that would escape  others. An advancing brain tumor did not  keep him from doing one more good work.

1128,3,2011-06-13,Mr. LATOURETTE.," This is a simple,  straightforward amendment.  During the committee markup of the  Military Construction bill, under the  able  leadership of the subcommittee  chairman, an amendment was offered  by Mr. FLAKEof Arizona to deny funding to the President’s Executive order  dealing with project labor agreements.  The matter was accepted by voice vote.  It was accepted by voice vote because,  quite  frankly,  I  couldn’t  rustle up  enough votes in the committee to overturn it.  However,  this continues a pattern  that we’ve seen in this Congress. I believe we’ve had on the floor four votes  on whether or not Davis-Bacon should  be the law of the land. In each one of  the cases,  the proponents of Davis-  Bacon have been successful, the last  one  garnering  52 Republican  votes.  This would be the third vote by those  who would wish  to  do  away with  project  labor  agreements  that will  occur on the House floor. In the previous two, again, the proponents of  project  labor  agreements have  prevailed. In the last instance, 28 Republicans were,  in  fact,  supportive  of  project labor agreements.  Mr.  Chairman,  basically,  project  labor agreements are those agreements  wherein someone who is doing a construction project determines that they  want to have an all-encompassing universal agreement that covers the construction from start to finish. If union  labor is involved, it denies unions the  ability to strike. It denies the contractor the ability to lock out. Wages  are set. Terms are set. Conditions are  set. And, quite  frankly, the project  labor agreements have been resounding  successes.  As a matter of  fact, project  labor  agreements,  90 percent of  them are  used by private industry. Some of the  biggest users of project  labor agreements are the Disney Corporation and,  in fact, Walmart. So neither of those  companies have ever been sort of identified as big labor-loving organizations.  Now, this is a backdoor piece of language in line 16 to 21 because it doesn’t  attack project labor agreements. What  it does is, if you go back and look in  February when President Obama enacted this Executive order, he said: I  don’t know which is going to be better  and which is going to be cheaper, based  upon the size of the project, where the  project is located, what it is we want  to get done.  So  funds are appropriated  to  the  agencies. Say it’s the Department of  Veterans Affairs  and  they’re  going  build a new hospital. You say, Department of Veterans Affairs, you study  which is going to bring that project in  at the best quality, the best price, on  time, and giving the taxpayer the best  bang for his or her buck.  Well, this amendment strikes that  funding. And so it doesn’t say you can’t  use project labor agreements. What it  does say is that the agency can’t make  that comparison. And  if you’re not  making that comparison to find out  which is better for the taxpayer, which  is in fact going to cause the project to  come in at the lowest cost and with the  best quality and under time, then it  has nothing to do with saving the taxpayer money.  We hear a lot about these are tough  times and we have to tighten our belts.  I agree with that. I voted for that consistently. But that is just union bashing. This is just saying we don’t want  to know whether a project labor agreement can develop a project that  is  cheaper, of better quality, and under  time.  Quite  frankly, although  there are  studies on both sides, there is an organization called ABC. They have a study  that shows that it adds so much cost.  You have a study by organized labor  that says it reduces so much cost. I  choose not to look at either of those  because each of those folks and organizations, quite frankly, have some skin  in the fight and have some incentive, if  you will, to look at the data one way  or another.  I would go with our nonpartisan, bipartisan Congressional Research Service, which last October was asked to  study this issue, and they indicated,  quite frankly, that the jury is out and,  if anything, the data  indicates that  they really can’t say and they can’t  find any convincing data as to whether  or not project labor agreements save  money or don’t  save money, which  really is the genius of the President’s  Executive order because  it says you  should study it.  Quite frankly, the CRS goes on to indicate that in those areas of the country where there’s a lot of organized  labor,  the project  labor agreements  tend to bring these projects in on time,  under  cost, with better quality.  In  those areas of the country which aren’t  heavily unionized, the opposite is, in  fact, true.  So with the jury being out and all of  us wanting to achieve the greatest savings for the taxpayer and build good,  quality projects in the military construction account which benefits our  men and women in uniform, why would  we deny the departments the opportunity to study which way is cheaper,  better, more effective, and with a better quality? So there’s only one reason.  It’s to continue this constant drumbeat  of: We hate unions. And that’s not a  good reason to have this language in  the bill.

1133,17,2011-06-13,The Acting CHAIR., The question is  on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FLORES).  The amendment was agreed to.  AMENDMENTOFFEREDBYMR. COFFMANOF  COLORADO  ,2011

1135,17,2011-06-13,The Acting CHAIR.," The Clerk will report the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  At the end of the bill (before the short  title) insert the following:  SEC. ll. None of the funds made available  in this Act may be used to by the Secretary  of Veterans Affairs  to provide disability  compensation under chapter 11 of title 38,  United States Code, to any veteran for post-  traumatic stress disorder if the required in-  service stressor claimed by the veteran is related to the veteran’s fear of hostile military  or terrorist activity and the places, types,  and circumstances of the veteran’s service  did not include a combat zone.  ",2011
1136,17,2011-06-13,Mr. CULBERSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  reserve a point of order on the gentleman’s amendment.  ",2011
1137,17,2011-06-13,The Acting CHAIR., A point of order  is reserved.  The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes.  ,2011
1138,17,2011-06-13,Mr.  COFFMAN  of  Colorado.," Mr.  Chairman, I stand with the American  people in wanting to make sure that  our  returning  servicemembers  from  Iraq and Afghanistan are taken care of.  The signature wound in this war has  emerged to be post-traumatic stress  disorder. Since  2008,  almost  100,000  claims  for disability based on post-  traumatic  stress disorder have been  awarded at a tremendous cost; but the  concern is, again, that these veterans  are taken care of. In July of last year,  new rules were promulgated as to the  eligibility criteria for post-traumatic  stress disorder. What they did was to  no longer require the servicemembers  to relate a specific combat occurrence  or occurrences to their post-traumatic  stress disorders.  It is my belief that these rules are  too loosely written and that what we  ought to have is more definition to say  that someone who has never served in  a combat zone should not be eligible  for post-traumatic stress disorder disability benefits—not  treatment. Certainly, one would be eligible for treatment,  but  I  understand  that  this  amendment will require the Veterans  Administration to create a definition  and to make decisions on something  they currently don’t do, which is: service in a combat zone.  ",2011
1139,17,2011-06-13,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia., Will the gentleman yield?  ,2011
1140,17,2011-06-13,Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado., I yield to  the gentleman.  ,2011
1141,17,2011-06-13,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  I certainly can appreciate the concerns that the gentleman raises that  have caused him to offer the amendment. Yet I want to remind the gentleman of the awful incident that occurred at Fort Hood in Texas. There  were a lot of our servicemembers who  were  present who  experienced  that  awful,  awful  situation. Under  this  amendment, it would prevent the veterans  and  servicemembers,  once  they’re discharged, from being able to  take advantage of the benefits of the  Department of Veterans Affairs because they were at Fort Hood as opposed to Afghanistan or Iraq or in some  other place of hostility.  Also, I would remind the gentleman  that the servicemembers who operate  our unmanned aerial vehicles, such as  the Predator, which has great capability for causing destruction in war—  it’s one of our great weapons—actually  can see on video, in realtime, the death  and  the  destruction  and  the  dismemberment that is caused by the utilization of that, although they’re  in  Nevada and  the weapon  is actually  making its impact in Afghanistan. Of  course, because of that, they would be  disqualified.  Under this amendment, I think the  gentleman’s point  is well  taken  in  wanting to make sure that only those  people who are entitled to veterans  benefits in fact get them, but I think  that perhaps there are some problems  in the artful drafting of the amendment, which should be clarified. Because of that, I am reluctant to support it, and of course must oppose this  amendment.  ",2011
1142,17,2011-06-13,Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado.," Reclaiming my time, the chairman has raised a  similar  issue. I certainly agree with  him and understand about the issue of  expanding the definition in this amendment to reflect terrorist activity that  would be beyond a combat zone. Again,  certainly, treatment would be available. We’re not  talking about  that.  We’re merely talking about disability  compensation. I probably disagree with  you, as a combat veteran myself, on  the ground side of your UAV example.  I realize that the amendment is out  of order because of the fact that it really impedes on authorizing versus appropriating. Certainly,  it  is my  intent—and I’d be happy to work with  the gentleman from Georgia as well as  with  the gentleman  from Texas—to  come up with a definition that makes  sure that we take care of those veterans who are most in need.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.  ",2011

1145,24,2011-06-13,Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas.," I thank  the gentleman.  I hear a lot of folks who talk about  the problem that we have economically,  the debt problem, all of  the  many things that we have been trying  to address here in the House, and I hear  them say, well, if we can just get to  where we need to be after the next  Presidential election, after the next  President, whoever that President is,  after that President is sworn in in January of 2013, if we can just get to that  point in time, then we can really address the problems.  b1940  That scares me because I don’t think  we can wait anywhere near that long.  In fact, I think we are already living on  borrowed time in terms of the crisis  that this country is facing. We know  for a fact President Clinton appointed  a Medicare commission over a decade  ago, a bipartisan Medicare commission.  Why did he do that? He did it because  we had a problem then. We had a problem then in 1998, and we still have that  problem now. We have a problem with  the insolvency of Medicare. We have a  problem with rising health care costs.  We have a problem with our debt and  the deficits that we run year after year  after year. We have a problem with too  much  regulation—too much  government regulation—which stifles job creation. We have a problem with our Tax  Code. If you’re talking about our business Tax Code and business taxes, we  have a problem there. Why? Because  it’s hard to compete with other countries when you’ve got the highest corporate tax rate in the world.  It’s not about whether you like big  business or small business. It’s about  job creators. And our Tax Code discourages  job creation.  If you’re  talking  about individual income tax, we’ve got  a problem there, too. We’ve got one of  the most complicated Tax Codes.  So what have we done about it here  in the House? Well, on all of these  counts we have acted. We have acted.  And we’ve been passing legislation that  addresses the jobs issue, our spending  issue, Medicare, the Tax Code, overregulation. This  is what we’ve been  doing day in and day out since we got  here.  And I would like to yield to some of  my friends. Before I do, I would just  like to say this: we’re the only one  with a plan. Where’s the Senate’s plan?  Where’s the President’s plan?  So as we discuss here tonight, I just  ask us all to think about where is the  other plan that we can compare ours  to. There’s not one. In fact, a former  Democratic National Committee chair  who’s running for Senate now in Virginia, Tim Kaine, said today, It’s a  pretty bad deal when the Senate hasn’t  even passed a budget. The U.S. Senate  doesn’t have a plan. The President  doesn’t have a plan. This House has a  plan. And we’re working hard every  day to execute it and implement it.  I would like to yield now to the gentlelady from Washington.  ",2011
1146,24,2011-06-13,Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER.," Thank  you. I appreciate my friend’s work here  on the floor.  I just came back from a week in my  home  district  in  southwest Washington. It’s a tremendous place. It’s  where I grew up. Some of my fondest  memories are in and around southwest  Washington, whether it was lakes or  rivers or streams or working my first  job at the Vancouver Mall. It’s not  even called the Vancouver Mall anymore. I had a lot of opportunities—a  lot of opportunities that I am very  worried the next generation of Washingtonians are not going to have. And  let me tell you why. Our unemployment has been over double digits going  on 3 years now.  Let me read this to you because this  is important. These aren’t just empty  numbers. These represent families and  lives: Clark County, 10.2 percent; Cowlitz County; 11.9 percent; Lewis County, 13.2 percent; Pacific County, 12.5  percent; Wahkiakum,  11.8  percent;  Skamania, 12.9 percent; and Thurston  County is at 8 percent.  Let me  compare  those  numbers  quickly. I’m not happy about 8 percent.  I’m not happy about 13 percent. But  there’s a slight difference in the reason  that the Thurston County numbers are  lower  than  the other counties, and  that’s because that’s where the State  government is housed.  So there are more government jobs,  more public sector jobs in that area.  But the rest of the district and even in  Thurston County  is based on  small  businesses. These are the hearts and  souls of our economy. Small business  owners,  entrepreneurs, mom-and-pop  shops.  I got  to  tour Somarakis Vacuum  Pumps. He is an engineer that started  a small  little company. Built  it up.  He’s passing it on to his son. He’s now  expanded into two counties. He has a  vision to grow and hire people. In fact,  he has been able to stay afloat these  last  few years because a  lot of the  trade that he’s done, he deals with  other corporations and other countries  across the world, which is one of the  reasons he’s been able to remain competitive.  You know what he told me this last  week when I was home and I was touring his new facility? He said, JAIME—I  wish I could give you his Greek accent,  but I can’t—he said, JAIME, I’m a proud  American.  I built this company because I believe in the entrepreneurial  spirit of America.  I believe  in this  country. But you in Washington, D.C.—  and he’s  speaking  to  the governing  class here—are making it harder for me  to function. You’re making it harder  for me to survive: the unpredictability,  the high taxes, the new energy proposals, some of which the President has  supported.  He said, JAIME, if that cap-and-trade  bill went into effect or if you increase  my energy taxes through the EPA, I  will be out of business. I will not be  able to hire the next generation of engineers and pass this company on.  And other small businesses around  our whole region and around our Nation are saying the same thing: can  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:40 Jun 14, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K13JN7.064 H13JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2011

1175,38,2011-06-13,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  wanted to address the issue of patent  reform—a bill the Senate has already  passed by an overwhelming margin. It  is my understanding the House of Representatives is expecting to pass a patent reform bill the House wants, and in  the process the House wants the Senate  to agree very soon thereafter and do it  without a formal conference.  I want my colleagues to understand  why I hope the House-passed bill will  contain a provision that was not in our  Senate bill but passed unanimously out  of the House Judiciary Committee.  The House committee report recognized that the ‘‘need to modernize patent laws has found expression in the  courts’’ but that ‘‘the courts are constrained in their decisions by the text  of statutes at issue.’’ That is from the  House committee report.  The  House  Judiciary  Committee  amendment that passed unanimously  resulted from a recent Federal court  case that had as its genesis the difficulty that the FDA—the Food and  Drug Administration—and the patent  office face when deciding how to calculate Hatch-Waxman deadlines. The  Hatch-Waxman law was a compromise  between drug patent holders and the  generic manufacturers. Under the Waxman-Hatch law, once a patent holder  obtains market approval, the patent  holder has 60 days to request the patent office to restore the patent term—  time lost because of the FDA’s long deliberating process eating up valuable  patent rights.  The citation for the case I am talking about is 731 F. Supp 2nd 470. The  court case found:  the FDA treats submissions to the FDA received after its normal business hours differently than it treats communications from  the agency after normal hours . . . when notice of FDA approval is sent after normal  business hours, the combination of the patent trade office’s calendar day interpretation  and its new counting method effectively deprives applicants of a portion of the 60-day  filing period that Congress expressly granted  them . . . an applicant could lose a substantial portion, if not all, of its time for filing  a patent trademark extension application as  a result of mistakes beyond its control . . .  an interpretation that imposes such drastic  consequences when  the  government  errs  could not be what Congress intended.  That is the end of the judge’s statement on why he ruled as he did in this  particular case. Congress did not intend those drastic consequences that  happen as a result of a difference between whether you are making an application to or an application from an  agency. In other words, there should  not be any difference. Congress did not  intend  the  consequences  that  come  from such a different application of the  law. So the court clarified the law so  when FDA sends a notice of approval  after normal business hours, the 60-day  period  requesting patent  restoration  begins  the next  business  day. The  House Judiciary Committee takes the  court decision where common  sense  dictates: to protect all patent holders  against losing patent extensions as a  result of confused counting calculations.  I want to quote Ranking Member  CONYERSof the House Judiciary Committee who sponsored the amendment  and committee Chairmen SMITHwho  supported ",2011
1176,38,2011-06-13,Mr. CONYERS.," Ranking Member JOHNCONYERSstated during markup the amendment is needed to  ‘‘remove what amounts  to a  trap and  would clarify the term ‘business day’  . . . and so, our attempt here  is to  make the congressional effort at patent reform more clear, more efficient.’’  Chairman LAMAR also advocated passage of this amendment during markup  in the House Judiciary  Committee. I will quote him.  SMITH I will recognize myself in support of the  amendment. Now, the gentleman’s amendment—  Meaning the Conyers amendment—  clarifies the counting rules that are imposed  on patent holders who must submit documents to the agency within statutory time  limits. It has been established that the PTO  has inconsistently applied these rules, which  is not fair to various patent holders. The  gentleman’s amendment tracks the recent  court case decided in favor of a patent holder  that originally applied for an extension 10  years ago. My understanding is that there  are not scoring problems with this provision  and I support it.  That is what Chairman LAMARSMITH  of the House Judiciary Committee said.  This is a commonsense amendment.  It improves our patent system fairness  through certainty and clarity, and I  hope the House will leave that in their  bill when it sends it over here to the  Senate.  My interest in this amendment is because I opposed it 2 or 3 years ago when  it was first brought up. Because of the  court decision, I am convinced the different application of the 60-day rule is  very unfair. As ranking member of the  Senate Judiciary Committee, I want  the House  Judiciary Committee  to  know  that  several Republican  and  Democratic Senators have asked me to  support the Conyers language as well.  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",2011
1177,38,2011-06-13,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  THE ECONOMY  ",2011
1178,38,2011-06-13,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Mr. President, the  latest unemployment numbers indicate  that nearly 106,000 Arkansans are unemployed. This 7.7 percent unemployment rate is higher than when the so-  called stimulus passed that President  Obama  and Majority  Leader REID  promised would produce jobs for hard-  working Americans. Although this rate  is below the national average, the numbers show that out-of-work Arkansans  continue to struggle to find gainful employment.  What is more alarming is that the  President and the majority here in the  Senate are resisting real change and  insisting on more of the same borrow,  spend, and tax policies that have given  us record unemployment and a sluggish  economy.  In November, Americans gave a clear  sign that job creation needs to be a priority. Unfortunately, the Senate majority and President Obama have failed  to prove that this is at the top of the  agenda. Time and time again, the Senate and our President add to the uncertainty  that  is  stifling  job creation.  Commonsense  legislation  that would  create the conditions for job growth is  not brought to the floor. It is not because the Senate has more pressing  issues. There is no excuse as to why the  Chamber avoids voting on legislative  and policy items that will provide real  relief for the unemployed, such as the  stalled free-trade agreements.  As news reports have pointed out  over the past several weeks, the business in this body is progressing at a  historically slow pace. As the Washington  Post  reported  last  week,  ‘‘Quorum calls have taken up about a  third of its time since January, according to the C–SPAN statistics.’’  Americans are tired of the games.  They need jobs, and it is our duty to  help.  Linda from Mountain Home, AR, recently wrote to me asking the same  thing millions of Americans want to  know: ‘‘Where are the jobs?’’ She continued her e-mail asking what legislation Republicans introduced that will  stimulate the economy and create jobs.  I want to thank Linda for her letter  and let her know my colleagues and I  are on the side of the American worker, and that is evident by the legislation we have offered. These practical  free market ideas will put Americans  back to work, and, like the millions of  Americans who are looking for jobs, we  are anxious to vote on them and approve these measures.  In  February,  we  introduced  the  REINS Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. Too often, Federal agencies  overstep their boundaries and enact expensive mandates that strangle investment and job creation without congressional  approval. This  commonsense  legislation provides a check and balance between Congress and the executive branch and allows business  to  focus on growth instead of how to comply with burdensome regulations.

1179,59,2011-06-13,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, if I might  add one point.  I think the Senator from Minnesota  did point out that there are a significant number of jobs that are associated  with this  industry—in  fact, one-half  million jobs. They are American jobs.  They are jobs in the heartland of this  country. They are jobs that help grow  the economy, make it more prosperous.  It strikes me, at least, that what we  ought to be looking at is more jobs in  this country and  less  investment  in  foreign regimes, where we get a lot of  our energy today.  Mr. President, $1 billion a day  is  what we send outside the United States  because of our addiction to foreign oil.  We have a dangerous dependence upon  foreign energy, and we have a fuel that,  as I said, displaces 445 million barrels  of oil every single year—more than we  import from Saudi Arabia. That is a  pretty remarkable number when you  think about it.  We had a debate here a few weeks ago  on the floor of the Senate about whether we ought to change tax policy with  regard to oil companies. The decision  was reached that we should not do  that; that  it would be punitive, directed at oil companies. We decided,  too, that it would raise taxes on gas for  people in this country.  I would make the same argument  today. We are talking about a tax increase—a large tax increase—which we  know is going to get passed on. So we  are talking about raising taxes on consumers at a time when they can least  afford it.  We have today 31⁄2to $4-a-gallon gasoline. The last thing consumers in this  country need is something that would  actually push that gas price higher. In  fact, if we did away with biofuels altogether—which some people would like  to do—there was a study out last year,  in 2010, that said the price per gallon of  gasoline would go up by 89 cents a gallon. So we have a proposal here that  would have an adverse impact on energy prices, fuel prices for people in  this country, which, frankly, again, because of  the commitment  that was  made  last December, strikes at the  very  heart  of  economic  certainty,  which so many of us come down here  and talk about: the importance of having policies in place that are reliable,  that people who are investing in particular areas of our economy can know  they are going to be there, at least  when Congress makes a commitment.  This  completely  undermines  the  commitment Congress made back  in  December that this particular tax credit would be in place until the end of the  year. So what the Senator from Minnesota and I have done is propose a  path  forward that we believe makes  sense and that is a thoughtful, measured, reasonable, responsible way  in  which to get to the goal that many of  the proponents of the amendment that  will be voted on tomorrow want to get  to; that is, to phase down the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit. But it  does it in a way that makes sense for  American consumers and  those who  have  investments  in  the  industry  today.  So I hope my colleagues will take a  look at this legislation. We think we  can get it moving this year. It does, as  was noted by my colleague from Minnesota, put a significant amount toward reducing the debt, which I think  is something all of our colleagues are  very interested in doing. So we will  present this legislation, obviously, to  our colleagues and hope there will be  many who will choose to support it.  Mr. President, I yield the floor back  to the Senator from Minnesota.  ",2011
1180,59,2011-06-13,Ms. KLOBUCHAR.," Mr. President,  again, we just hope our colleagues will  look at this bill. It is a serious bill and  very different  than other bills  that  have been proposed in the past, and it  actually takes existing money that was  set out for the end of this year and puts  a big number—$1 billion—into debt reduction.  f  SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS  SENATE  RESOLUTION  PORTING  NATIONAL  HEALTH WEEK  Mr. CRAPO submitted the following  resolution; which was considered and  agreed to:  207—SUPMEN’S  S.

1182,66,2011-06-13,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pleasure that I rise today to join the supporters  and volunteers gathered this evening to congratulate Habitat for Humanity of Greater New  Haven as they celebrate their silver anniversary. In its 25 year history this outstanding organization, fueled by the generosity and energy of its volunteers, has revitalized many of  our neighborhoods and enhanced the quality  of life in our community. Theirs is a mission  that is quite literally reflected in the theme of  this  celebration—building  hope,  lives,  and  neighborhoods.  Over  the course of  its history, Habitat  for  Humanity of Greater New Haven has forged  partnerships with  individuals,  religious  and  civic organizations, as well as  local businesses and corporations that have translated  into homeownership opportunities  for more  than eighty families. Offering a hand up rather  than a hand out, families who qualify for the  homebuyers program work side by side with  community volunteers to build their home, investing a minimum of 400  ‘‘sweat equity’’  hours to the project. The families’ personal investment also translates into their personal investment in the community.  Founded by a group of community leaders,  Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven,  like its sister chapters across the country, is a  real grassroots organization.  It encourages  people to dedicate their words and actions to  the elimination of poverty housing and attracts  more than 2,000 volunteers every year. The  need  for affordable and safe housing  is as  much a need today as it was when this local  organization was founded 25 years ago and it  is heartening to know that there are so many  who so willingly devote their time and energies  to these efforts.  I would like to take this opportunity to extend my deepest thanks and appreciation to  the many volunteers and donors who have  gathered tonight to celebrate this remarkable  milestone. Without  their generosity, compassion, and willingness to devote their time and  energy,  the mission of Habitat  for Humanity  would not be possible. Whether they have donated  funds, construction material, or simply  their time, it has been through their good work  that Habitat  for Humanity of Greater New  Haven has been able  to make such a difference in our community.  A home is so much more than simply a roof  over ones head—it is a source of pride, comfort, independence and stability. This is the gift  of Habitat for Humanity and I have been proud  to support the good work that they have accomplished throughout Greater New Haven. I  am honored  to stand  today  to extend my  heartfelt congratulations to Habitat for Humanity of Greater New Haven on their 25th Anniversary. I have no doubt that they will continue  their extraordinary contributions for as long as  there is a need.  f  BOB HENLEY TRIBUTE  HON. SCOTT R.

In 1996, Mr. Henley began working as a  tour guide for Chimney Rock, which helped to  foster his appreciation of  the archeological  area, and urged him to seek that tours of the  ruins be  independently operated  in order  to  ensure the area receive proper attention and  upkeep. In 2003, Mr. Henley’s work helped to  make Chimney Rock an independent organization.  Because of his efforts and  the efforts of  many volunteers, the Chimney Rock Interpretive Association hosts nearly 11,000 visitors in  total each year, allowing it to be independently  funded and operated. In addition, the Association  is able  to give elementary schools  free  tours, educating between 300 and 500 students about the history of the Chimney Rock  Archeological site every year.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is my honor  to recognize  Bob Henley today.

For her numerous contributions to her  community, Lila will receive the congregation’s  prestigious ‘‘Woman of Valor’’ award.  Lila has served as a leader of the Rockland  Jewish community since 1953. As her husband Jules rose to the head of their congregation  in  the 1970s, Lila sought  to encourage  women’s involvement in the Jewish issues as  Chairwoman of Rockland County Israel Bonds  Women’s Division, President of Sisterhood at  the Jewish Community Center, and a lifelong  member of Hadassah.  In addition to her work in the Jewish community, Lila pursued a career as a  ‘‘Professional Volunteer.’’  While raising  three children, she  took  the  time to work as a Pink Lady at Good Samaritan Hospital and as a literacy volunteer.  Lila now works as an adult  teacher at  Shaaray Israel where she teaches a class on  Jewish appreciation. Every Wednesday she  leads a discussion on Jewish issues ranging  from religious issues to Israeli politics.  As a grandmother of 11, Lila has instilled in  her  family a respect  for Jewish  tradition as  well as a sense of gratitude and support for  the state of Israel, which she and her husband  travel to frequently. Her visits to Israel began  in 1950, when she first went with her parents  lugging suitcases of clothing as well as money  for the needy of the fledgling new country.  Through her charity and tireless dedication  to her community, Lila has certainly earned  her title as a ‘‘Woman of Valor,’’ and I congratulate her on this honor.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

HONORING  HARRIET  BEECHER  STOWE ON HER BICENTENNIAL  ANNIVERSARY  HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO  OFCONNECTICUT  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 13, 2011  ",2011
1187,73,2011-06-13,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Speaker,  this month  marks the bicentennial anniversary of the birth  of one of our nation’s most influential and eminent women authors, Harriet Beecher Stowe,  and it is with great pride that I rise today to  join Connecticut’s Harriet Beecher Stowe Center in recognizing this remarkable milestone as  well as celebrate this Connecticut daughter’s  life and distinguished career.  Harriet Beecher Stowe was  the most  famous American woman of  the 19th century  and what earned her that status was her best-  selling, anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin.  What you may not know is that she made her  home in Hartford, Connecticut, and with neighbors including Mark Twain, Isabella Beecher,  Joseph Hawley, Charles Dudley Warner, and  William Gillette, Stowe  lived and worked  in  what was one of the nation’s preeminent literary communities.  Uncle Tom’s Cabin was and still is an extraordinary story. Through  its pages, Stowe  brought humanity  to slavery  in  the United  States and catapulted the issue to the forefront of the time’s political debate. Her informal, conversational style spoke  to people,  touching them in a way that political speeches  and newspaper accounts could not. While  there were many contributing  factors  to  the  outbreak of the Civil War, it is often said that  Uncle Tom’s Cabin and the debates that its  publication sparked helped 19th century Americans determine what kind of country  they  wanted. In fact, it is said that upon meeting  Stowe in the White House in 1862, President  Abraham Lincoln said to her, ‘‘So you are the  little woman who wrote the book that started  the Great War.’’  Stowe was a prolific writer and Uncle Tom’s  Cabin may have been her most famous work  but it was certainly not her only book. In fact,  over her  lifetime, she wrote more  than 30  books and novels. Her broad range of interests resulted  in such varied publications as  children’s text books, advice books on homemaking and child  rearing as well as biographies and religious studies. In each of her  works, Stowe’s unique style encouraged discussion among everyday people and  those  ranged from slavery to religious reform to gender roles. Though overshadowed by her most  famous of works, Stowe’s ability to influence  public debate on a variety of controversial topics and the influence she had on shaping public opinion is undeniable.  Today, the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center,  located in Hartford, Connecticut, uses Stowe’s  life story and work to inspire social justice and  positive change with programs and initiatives  that  reach  thousands across  the world.  In  Connecticut, we are proud to call Harriet Beecher Stowe our First Lady of Literature and we  could not be more proud to celebrate her life,  her work, and her invaluable contributions to  our society. Two hundred years after her birth,  Harriet Beecher Stowe’s life continues to inspire the belief that each of us can make a difference in the world—that one person, using  their  talent  and  determination,  can  create  change.

1188,80,2011-06-13,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. Speaker, today, I would  like to recognize Jessica Boland, a third-grade  teacher at Rose Lane Elementary School  in  Phoenix, Arizona, who on April 28th, 2011, received the 2010 Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science. This honor  is recognition of teachers with an exemplary  record in both mathematics and science. Ms.  Boland  is one of only 85  recipients of  this  celebrated honor.  Ms. Boland always knew she wanted to be  a teacher. The goal of all teachers should be  to do everything possible to encourage, support, and promote excellence  in  the classroom, and she eagerly takes on this challenge  every day. Ms. Boland has proven that she is  up to this task, and while she is humbled and  honored by  this award,  the satisfaction she  gets every day when a classroom of eager  students ‘‘get it,’’ is by far her greatest reward.  Jessica’s day does not begin with the first  bell, nor does it end when her class is dismissed. She provides before and after school  assistance to students who are struggling with  their school work, offering a greater opportunity to succeed. She facilitates math academies for parents so that their children have  more than just one teacher to help them understand. Her belief is that if a parent can help  at home, then the child never runs out of opportunities to learn. She also works with student teachers who will soon be entering the  field of education. This allows for each new  generation of teachers to have a greater feeling of comfort when entering the classroom for  the first time. Students then receive a quality  education,  regardless of  the experience of  their teacher.  Few awards offer such esteem and honor  as  the Presidential Award  for Excellence  in  Mathematics and Science. This award is testimony to the gratitude that our nation shares  for teachers like Jessica Boland. I am proud  today  to enter  this  recognition of Jessica’s  achievements  into  the  RECORD, and hope that all teachers across our  great nation share  in  the  responsibility  that  she has undertaken. It is with great joy and  honor  that  I  recognize Jessica Boland, and  thank her with never-ending gratitude for giving her students  the greatest opportunity  to  succeed.  CONGRESSIONAL  f  HONORING MARINE SERGEANT  SEAN T. CALLAHAN  HON. FRANK R. WOLF  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 13, 2011  ",2011
1189,80,2011-06-13,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, Marine Sergeant  Sean T. Callahan  of Warrenton, Virginia,  made the supreme sacrifice for his country on  April 23, 2011, while conducting combat operations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Sergeant Callahan was assigned antitank missile  duties and was with the 3rd Battalion of the  9th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II  Marine Expeditionary Force, based at Camp  Lejeune, North Carolina.  Sean  joined  the Marine Corps  in March  2008 and received a combat meritorious promotion to the grade of sergeant on February  2, 2011. He deployed in support of Operation  Iraqi Freedom from August until October 2009.  He deployed again in support of Operation Enduring  Freedom  in December,  2010. His  awards include a Purple Heart, the Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal,  Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Iraq Campaign  Medal, Global War  on  Terrorism Service  Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, and Navy-Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Valor  Device. Sean was escorted home from Dover,  Delaware, by his brother, Corporal Daniel J.  Callahan, who is assigned to the 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion  at Camp  Pendleton, California.  Sean was born on Flag Day, June 14, 1987,  in Manassas, Virginia,  the youngest of  four  children. He grew up in Prince William County  and graduated from Brentsville High School in  2005. He was an accomplished guitar player  who loved music and went out of his way to  encourage younger musicians to pursue their  shared love of music.  Sergeant Callahan’s leadership qualities, his  loyalty and dedication all  found a purpose  when he  joined  the United States Marine  Corps. He believed deeply in his calling to defend the freedoms granted in America and in  the defense of dignity and  freedom  in other  countries.  Sean was a true son of Virginia and will be  deeply missed by those who knew and loved  him.  f  SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS  Title  IV  of Senate Resolution  4,  agreed to by the Senate on February 4,  1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized schedule of all  meetings and hearings of Senate committees, subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference.

1191,5,2011-06-21,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) for 5 minutes.  ,2011
1192,5,2011-06-21,Mr. GOHMERT.," Mr. Speaker, as always, it’s an honor to speak here in the  House of Representatives.  I heard Democratic friends mention  earlier that what we need to do to get  the economy going is start spending on  infrastructure  because  our  grandchildren will really appreciate the dollars that they have to pay years from  now that we spent on infrastructure.  The only  thing  is,  that’s  exactly  what our friends across the aisle were  saying in January of 2009 when they  wanted an $800 billion stimulus package that turned out to be maybe $900  billion or $1 trillion. It was going to be  for  infrastructure. And many  in the  American public said, yeah, that’s a  good  idea.  It  turned out  that only  around 6 percent or so, 6 to 7 percent  may have been for infrastructure.  Okay. Fooled us once, shame on you.  Fool us twice, shame on us.  The  thing  is,  some of us weren’t  fooled even back then. We had already  seen things that were said that would  be done that were not done. So I voted  against that so-called ‘‘porkulus’’ stimulus, or whatever you want to call it,  bill. I voted against TARP because in  America we’re not supposed to  just  give one man $700 billion and say, go do  whatever  you want with  all  this  money; we don’t care, just fix things.  Because he certainly didn’t fix things,  although he did engorge his buddies at  Goldman Sachs.  Nonetheless, we do face economic difficulties. And within the last 2 weeks  there were six of us, a bipartisan group,  in Turkey. Their economy seems to be  going very well, and we were seeing  things  growing  and  doing well  in  Istanbul. And they don’t understand  sarcasm very well and so, but I, nonetheless, said to some of their economic  leaders, business leaders, so you must  have had many huge stimulus packages  to get the economy going. They looked  at me like I was crazy because they  don’t understand sarcasm very well in  another  language  I guess. But they  spoke good English.  Nonetheless, they didn’t use stimulus  packages. But they did say they had  dropped their corporate tax rate that  was much too high down to 20 percent,  and now businesses have been coming  in. That works. It works whenever it’s  been tried.  But  let me get to another point.  Credibility is always relevant. In my  days as a judge and chief justice that  was one of the rules of the court. Credibility is always an issue. It’s always  relevant. So when this country makes  promises to people and doesn’t keep  them, or they’re stupid promises to  people we know will not keep their  word to us, we lose credibility.  We found out now that this administration  is  negotiating  with  the  Taliban; basically, you know, just let  us out. We’re negotiating with  the  Taliban? Did Hoover negotiate with  Dillinger, and Bonnie and Clyde?  Did Robert Kennedy, as Attorney  General, negotiate with the Mob?  When people are involved and they’re  criminals and they’re murderers and  they’re engaged  in criminal activity  and they’ve never kept a promise, do  you really want to be making that  deal?  Now, I know it seems like we should  have learned a lesson from the Clinton  administration. When North Korea was  trying to build nukes, the Clinton administration sends Madeleine Albright,  and she comes in, hey, hey, how about  dropping  pursuing nuclear weapons?  We’ll build you a nuclear power plant if  you’ll just—you’ll build us a nuclear  power plant if we just tell you we won’t  pursue it? Sure, we’ll tell you that all  day long.  b1230  So they cut a deal. We built them a  nuclear plant, and that has been used  to develop nuclear weapons, just like  anybody should have figured it would.  When you deal with criminals, with  lying thugs, you can’t trust that agreement.  For us to be negotiating with the  Taliban is a blight on those who have  given their lives there. I attended a funeral this weekend of Brad Gaudet,  who went down in a helicopter accident  on June 5. We owe those people who  have given their lives fighting against  those who want to destroy our way of  life better than cutting a deal.  Let’s rearm the Northern Alliance,  the people that originally defeated the  Taliban—just give them the advisers,  the trainers, all that they need, and let  them whip the Taliban for us again.  Let’s not negotiate with Dillinger. It  makes no sense and we lose credibility.  f  RECESS  ",2011

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, on Friday, Congressman DARRELL ISSAconducted a field hearing in  North Charleston, South Carolina. A  witness who really brought home the  consequences families will face as a result of the NLRB’s  job-killing complaint was Cynthia Ramaker, who is  currently employed at Boeing.  Bringing a human face to the complaint, she explained how the NLRB is  denying her right to work. She explained that Boeing’s new 1.1 million  square foot building is already completed. Manufacturing is to begin this  summer, with over 1,000 jobs already,  and up to 3,800 more jobs could come.  With construction and suppliers, ultimately 9,000 jobs could be created.  Boeing was attracted to South Carolina because of the trained world-class  workforce, a welcoming pro-business  climate, right to work laws, and a pro-  business government of Republicans  and Democrats.

1200,19,2011-06-21,Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado.," In listening to the opposition, the statements  against this legislation, it would make  it sound like the EAC, the Election Assistance Commission, is a branch of the  Justice Department, that it’s there to  enforce the right to vote. It doesn’t do  any of that at all.  The primary goal for the Election Assistance Commission was, after  the  Florida recount, the problems there in  the 2000 election, that according to the  Help America Vote Act,  that  the  States such as Colorado that I was the  Secretary of State in, were going to  have to have a voter registration system that would be interactive, interactive database,  to make  sure  that  there wasn’t fraud, that there wasn’t  duplicative registrations; and that the  EAC would be the conduit for Federal  resources grants to States to be able to  facilitate that, and to make sure that  that was carried out by the States. And  that was for the 2008 Presidential election,  long  since done,  long accomplished.  As to the EAC, which has no ability  to mandate anything to States, but as  an  advisory  tool,  election  officials  across this country don’t utilize  it.  There are associations  that provide  those best practices at every level of  elections, from the county clerks to  the Secretaries of State. And so this is  an agency who’s primary purpose  is  long since over with, and we can transfer the remaining function over to the  Federal Elections Commission. And I  rise in strong support for H.R. 672 and  would urge its passage.  ",2011

1203,19,2011-06-21,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, it is disappointing that we are  here in the dark of night discussing the  issues of election fairness. I would almost imagine it would be somewhat  similar to taking up the Voting Rights  Act, the one of 1965, in the dark of  night.  We can speak lightly about this, but  I will tell you that every election time  someone is denied the right to vote in  the United States. I hope Americans  are paying attention tonight to realize  that even though it is represented that  the change and eliminating the particular agency  that deals with  the  questions of fairness, the Election Assistance Commission, we’re actually  not saving money, and passing the responsibilities off to the Federal Elections Commission.  Why could we not have accepted the  amendment of the distinguished gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. GONZALEZ),  who said let’s do it right. Let’s have a  general accountable study and know  what we’re doing and if we’re taking  away the rights of those who are desiring to vote.  I will tell you that the purging of  voters that occurs in Texas and other  places around the Nation, and in particular  in Harris County,  is not a  minor issue. The distraction of African  American male voters in Florida during the 2000 election is not simply a  distraction.  And so the question is, even if this  deals with interactive data, let me suggest to you that it is an important tool  for local government because without  this particular commission, those resources or those responsibilities and  the finding of the money will be on  local governments. So now we’re doing  unfunded mandates.  I would simply say that it was painful to pass the health bill.  ",2011

It  is history, my colleagues know that it  is, but they know how painful it was to  be engaged in hanging chads and discussions about who was turned away  from the voting booth—and also the  discrepancies on how we count our  votes in America, the most sophisticated Nation in the world, the Nation  that others look to and say, how do we  promote democracy?  Why would we stand on the floor of  the House at 8 o’clock tonight and  deny democracy? I ask my colleagues  to oppose this legislation and to stand  for democracy and fairness.  ",2011

1209,19,2011-06-21,Mr.  HOYER.," He did not state that the EAC  should have an eternal life. What he  said is, it was essential, in its present  form, in the function that it provides.  I think he also indicated that everything is not a simple budget or mathematical problem. There is cost benefit  to look into and see what the true benefit is for the investment of that Federal dollar.  Much has been said about the National Association of Secretaries of  State coming out with a resolution.  That is not news. From the very inception they opposed the creation of the  Election Assistance Commission, and  on a regular basis they would pass a  resolution expressing that opposition.  But I do wish to point out that the  president of the National Association  of Secretaries of State, Secretary of  State of Minnesota Mark Ritchie—  whose State knows something about  the cost of problematic elections—testified before our committee on March  31 that he was certainly not in favor of  terminating  the Election Assistance  Commission.

I am a  Republican and have been active in the  Republican Party since 1968. I am also  the Republican member of the Standards Board of the Election Assistance  Commission.  As a representative of a local board  of elections, we are very isolated and  depend on the EAC as a clearinghouse  of information and resources. The EAC  has been most helpful to local boards of  elections in supporting our election administration and providing guidance in  future elections. The FEC is too political and cannot do and perform as the  Election Assistance Commission.  The passage of H.R. 672 will be a loss  to local boards of election nationwide.  We are the grassroots of the election  community, and we need the support of  the EAC.  In closing, we will in fact defeat this  tomorrow. I’m hoping that my amendment will be ruled in order and that we  will have a chance to really look at the  potential effect this bill will have on  local election officials. Not to politicize it. This is not about Republicans  or about Democrats; it’s about how effective and efficient our local election  officials can be. With the assistance of  the only clearinghouse, the only commission with  the expertise and  the  dedication to that single goal. There  will be no other agency like it, there  will be no other commission like it,  and it’s well worth the investment that  we make on a yearly basis to assure  the integrity and the efficiency of our  local elections. I don’t know of any  better investment.  I understand that we have to tighten  our belts. Do we do it, though, at the  cost of the efficient running of our  elections, the very basis for our democracy?  I commend the Members on the other  side of the aisle for this effort, but it is  truly misguided. It’s not based on facts  or the realities on the ground. And almost every local election official will  echo those sentiments today.  I oppose this bill. I will be voting  against it. And I ask my colleagues to  please oppose this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2011

1238,40,2011-06-21,Mr.  JOHANNS.," Madam President,  over a year ago now, the President  signed into law health care legislation  that we are finding is certainly long on  promises but short on sound policy.  Unfortunately, the legislation did not  follow a transparent or thorough process.  Instead,  it was hastily  rushed  through on a premise that has now become  famous,  as  said  by Speaker  PELOSI: We have to pass it to see what  is in it. Now, almost daily, newspapers,  constituent mail, and independent reports continue to reveal that the law’s  promises are not reality.  Recently,  the  Columbus Dispatch  told the story of a family with a preexisting  condition. Two  years  ago,  their struggles to find health insurance  coverage outraged this administration.  In fact, their hardship was specifically  used as an example of why we needed  to get the health care system reformed.  Well, party affiliation did not define  how we felt about this family. We all  empathized and sympathized with their  struggles and recognized the need for  basic health  insurance reforms. But,  unfortunately, we did not harness that  common ground to develop sound policy that addresses the very real problems within the health care system. Instead,  a  bitterly  partisan  bill was  shoved through Congress, and now we  are stuck with its consequences.  So what are the consequences for the  family who struggled to get insurance?  The article reports that their annual  premium has  increased  a whopping  $12,000. Clearly, one result of the law is  soaring premiums. President Obama  promised no fewer than 20 times that  he would cut premiums by $2,500 for  the average family by the end of his  term. But, unfortunately, this is not an  isolated story. This broken promise is  evident in homes all across this great  Nation. Mail from frustrated Nebraskans continues to flood my office. They  question how a health care law that  costs so much yet still allows skyrocketing premiums could have ever  passed.  A single mother from Bellevue, NE,  recently found out that her family’s  health care premium increased by $700  per year. Her insurance provider explained it was due to mandates in the  new health care law.  She pleaded with me:  Please stand up on behalf of single moms  like me. We do all we can to hold our world  together, give up time with our children to  work two jobs . . . and now this! How am I  supposed to maintain health insurance for  my family?  Well, I wish I could tell constituents  their premiums will not go up, as the  President promised. I wish I could tell  them  the new health care  law addressed the rising costs of health care,  as the President promised it would. Instead, these stories reflect what the experts predicted would happen if the law  passed. The nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office  estimated  that  individual  health  insurance  premiums  would increase by an average of $2,100  per family due solely to the new mandates included in the law. That puts  the gap between Candidate Obama’s  promise and President Obama’s health  care law at an alarming $4,600 per family.  The administration’s own Medicare  Actuary expects health care costs to  increase $311 billion over the next decade under the new law. In fact, the Actuary  testified  that  the President’s  promise that the health care law would  lower costs was ‘‘false, more so than  true.’’  Now, some may say: MIKE, just wait  until the  law  is  fully  implemented.  That is when the promises will be fulfilled. But I continue to get reports on  my desk forecasting the negative consequences  of  this  irresponsible  and  shortsighted piece of legislation.  For example, one of the law’s major  flaws  is that about half of  its new  health insurance coverage is achieved  by locking millions of more people on  an already-broken Medicaid system.  Yet the New England Journal of Medicine recently released a study showing  those on Medicaid struggle to find doctors to treat them.  The medical  journal’s research revealed that 66 percent of individuals  who mentioned Medicaid’s Children  Health Insurance Program when calling to schedule a medical appointment  were denied an appointment  for the  child.  That is compared to only 11 percent  who said they had private insurance.  That  is right—those on Medicaid’s  CHIP were six times more likely to be  denied treatment.  And when Medicaid was accepted, the  children had to wait, on average, 22  days longer than those with private insurance.  Researchers blame low Medicaid payments, delays in paying, and bureaucratic  redtape driving doctors  from  even accepting these patients.  As a former Governor, I can tell you  that these problems have long plagued  the Medicaid Program.  Yet in 2014 the President’s new law  dramatically expands Medicaid, dumping over 24 million more Americans  onto this very broken system. How can  the President promise guaranteed coverage for these millions of Americans  when this study shows the majority of  our most vulnerable population is denied treatment under the Medicaid system? The bottom line is you cannot receive care if you cannot find a doctor  to provide it. The logic simply does not  match the promise.  Another recent study by the consulting group McKinsey & Company  calls another one of the President’s  guarantees into question. Their study  analyzed the impact of the health care  law on employer-sponsored benefits.  Prior to the health care law, America’s employers were the backbone of  our Nation’s health care system, providing  165 million Americans with  health care coverage. The McKinsey  study found that 30 percent of employers will definitely or probably stop offering their employees health care insurance after 2014.  During the health care debate, supporters of the law insisted that the law  builds on the principle of employer-  sponsored coverage.  The President even repeatedly promised if you like your plan, you can keep  it. But again, this appears to be an  empty promise.  According to the study—and others  that came before it—employees will be  stripped of plans that they like and  dumped onto the new law’s health care  exchanges to fend for themselves.  I realize there is some disagreement  surrounding this particular study. But  how can we deny this commonsense  logic?  The more you know about this law,  the more you conclude it just does not  make sense for employers to offer a  health care plan.  Beginning in 2014, the health care law  mandates that employers with more  than 50 workers offer health insurance  coverage or pay a penalty of $2,000 per  worker. And with this mandate comes  a slew of other requirements. Suddenly  dropping coverage and paying the $2,000  penalty becomes an economic necessity.  During  the health  care debate,  I  spoke about this on the Senate floor. I  and many others warned that the proposed penalties  for businesses would  create a perverse incentive. When you  do the math, I said back then this is no  penalty at all, compared to the cost of  private insurance.  It is a wise business decision if you  are worried about  the bottom  line.  That is how the law encourages employers to dump their employees onto  the exchange.  A Deloitte consultant told the Associated Press, ‘‘I don’t know if the intent was to find an exit strategy for  providing benefits, but the bill as written provides  the mechanism.’’ John  Deere has responded by saying businesses will look into ‘‘just paying the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:54 Feb 24, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S21JN1.REC S21JN1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

1251,47,2011-06-21,Mr. LEVIN.," I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield myself 10 minutes.  Mr. President,  the nomination  of  Leon Panetta to be Secretary of Defense is a wise and a solid nomination.  Director Panetta has given decades of  dedicated public service to this Nation,  and we should all be grateful he is once  again willing to answer the call and  take the helm at the Department of  Defense. We are also grateful to his  wife Sylvia  for her  significant  sacrifices over the last 50 years in supporting Leon Panetta’s efforts in the  public and private sectors.  When Mr. Panetta appeared before  the Armed Services Committee at his  nomination hearing, all of our Members commented invariably in the same  way—reflecting the view that we are  grateful Mr. Panetta is willing to take  on this position. He is going to bring a  reassuring level of continuity and in-  depth experience. He has been a critical member of President Obama’s national security team during his tenure  as Director of the Central Intelligence  Agency. The Department of Defense  will need Director Panetta’s skill and  his wisdom to navigate the extraordinarily complex set of challenges in  the years ahead.  Foremost among those demands are  the demands on our Armed Forces, and  these are exemplified by the ongoing  wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Between  those two conflicts, we continue to  have approximately 150,000 troops deployed. The U.S. military is also providing support to NATO operations to  protect the Libyan people. In addition,  even after the extraordinary raid that  killed Osama bin Laden, we face potential terrorist threats against us and  against our allies which emanate from  Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other  places.  The risk of a terrorist organization  getting their hands on and detonating  an improvised nuclear device or other  weapon of mass destruction remains  one of the gravest possible threats to  the United States. To counter  that  threat,  the Defense Department  is  working with  the Departments  of  State, Energy, Homeland Security, and  other U.S. Government agencies to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons,  fissile materials, and dangerous  technologies. As Secretary of Defense,  Director Panetta’s leadership in this  area will be of vital importance. Here  again, it is that experience as Director  of the CIA which will be so invaluable.  In  the  coming  weeks,  President  Obama and his advisers will  face a  number of key national security decisions. While  the drawdown of U.S.  forces in Iraq remains on track, there  have been recent signs of instability in  that country. As a result, it is possible  that Iraq’s political leadership may ask  for some kind of continuing U.S. military presence beyond the December 31  withdrawal deadline which was agreed  to by President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki in the 2008 Security Agreement.  Another key decision point is looming  in Afghanistan  regarding  reductions  in U.S.  forces  starting  next  month. President Obama said the other  day:  It’s now time for us to recognize that we  have accomplished a big chunk of our mission and that it’s time for Afghans to take  more responsibility.  The President also said a few months  ago that the reductions starting next  month will be ‘‘significant.’’ Hopefully,  they will be. Director Panetta, while  not assigning a specific number, agreed  they need to be significant. A significant reduction in our troop level this  year would send a critical signal to Afghan leaders that we mean it when we  say our commitment is not open-ended  and that they need to be urgently focused on preparing Afghanistan’s security forces to assume security responsibility for all of Afghanistan. The more  that Afghan security forces do that,  the better the chances of success because the Taliban’s biggest nightmare  is  facing  a  large,  effective Afghan  Army—an army which is already respected by the Afghan people, but now,  hopefully—and soon—in control of Afghanistan’s security.  Another major issue facing the Department is the stress that 10 years of  unbroken war has placed on our Armed  Forces. Over the last decade, many of  our service men and women have been  away from their families and homes for  multiple tours. Not only is our force  stressed, so are our military families.  We owe them our best efforts to reduce  the number of deployments and  increase the time between deployments.  The next Secretary of Defense will  have to struggle with the competing  demands on our  forces while Washington  struggles with an  extremely  challenging  fiscal  environment.

Director Panetta  has  contributed  nearly five decades of public service to  our Nation, including as an officer in  the U.S. Army, a distinguished Congressman, and most recently as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency,  a position for which he was confirmed  by the Senate on February 12, 2009. He  and I served together in the House of  Representatives from my first term in  1979 until he departed in 1993 to become  Director of the Office of Management  and Budget. Over the past 21⁄2years, I  have had the opportunity to frequently  work with Director Panetta, in my role  as a senior member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  Like  his  predecessor, Dr. Robert  Gates—who also served as CIA Director  before becoming Secretary of Defense—  Director Panetta brings to the Pentagon a wealth of experience built over  a lifetime of service to his Nation and  his fellow Americans. Over the past 21⁄2  years, Director Panetta has repaired a  damaged relationship between the CIA  and Congress, an  impressive accomplishment, to say the least, and led the  agency and the Nation’s human intelligence activities at a time when the  Nation waged two wars and contended  with  such  threats as  Islamic extremism, terrorism, and cyber intrusion  and attack.  And of course, Director Panetta will  forever be remembered as the CIA Director during the May 1, 2011, mission  in which U.S. forces once and for all rid  the world of public enemy No. 1 and  brought justice to the evil incarnate  that was Osama bin Laden. On that  night, the combined might of our Nations military, intelligence, and counterterrorism professionals sent the unmistakable message to the terrorists of  the world that America will prevail in  this fight.  I deeply appreciate Director Panetta’s efforts at the CIA, and believe he  leaves  the entire Agency,  from  the  halls of Langley to its agents in the  farthest reaches of the world, a better  and more capable organization than it  was when he arrived. I am confident  that Director Panetta’s unique experiences within the military, the Congress,  and  the  intelligence  communities will serve him, the Department  of Defense, and the Nation well when  he assumes the role of Secretary of Defense.  More than 41⁄2years ago, in December  2006, I rose in support of the nomination of Dr. Gates for the position for  which we consider Director Panetta  today. At the time, I said that Dr.  Gates and the Nation were facing the  imperative of charting a new course  and strategy in Iraq, rising violence in  Afghanistan,  global  terrorism,  the  threats posed by nuclear states such as  North Korea and possibly Iran, and the  increasing strains on our military.  Director Panetta faces similar challenges today. He must continue to help  shape our role in Iraq, define our strategy  for the Nation’s  future  involvement in Afghanistan, and recapitalize  and reconstitute the elements of our  military that have been at war  for  nearly a decade, while ensuring that  the U.S. military is prepared to meet  and overcome any hurdle on the horizon, whether in North Korea, China,  Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, or other, as yet unknowable,  places around this globe.  At his confirmation hearing before  the Senate Armed Services Committee  on June 9, Director Panetta said, ‘‘We  are no longer in the Cold War. This is  more like the blizzard war—a blizzard  of challenges that draws speed and intensity  from terrorism,  from rapidly  developing technologies, and the rising  number of powers on the world stage.’’  Director Panetta must confront the  unpredictable vagaries of this ‘‘blizzard  war’’ within perhaps the most arduous  budgetary environment our Nation has  faced since the Great Depression—an  environment in which President Obama  has already called for $400 billion in reductions to national security spending  over the next decade, much of which  will come out of Department of Defense  budgets.  It is hard to imagine how exactly  cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars  to national security budgets can be  possible without both significant tradeoffs and a fundamental retooling of our  national  security  strategy. Perhaps  more imperative than any other task  confronting him, Director Panetta will  likely be the individual most responsible for ensuring that our national security strategy is appropriate for meeting our global and national security interests, and that our defense budgets  are sufficient to meet those challenges.  In this era in which distance alone is  insufficient  to  insulate  the United  States and our global interests from  terrorists and nations that wish to do  us harm, Director Panetta faces the extraordinary task of ensuring that our  Armed Forces remain able to defeat today’s  conventional  and  irregular  threats, project power and U.S. presence around the world, and develop the  war fighting capabilities necessary for  our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines to prevail in the conflicts of the  future.  If any nominee possesses the defense  and budget bona fides required for such  times, it is Director Panetta, who has  demonstrated his capabilities as Director of the CIA, as former OMB Director, and as the  former chair of the  House Budget Committee.  I believe  that he is well prepared for the challenges of  leading the Department of  Defense, and I will vote to confirm Director Panetta as our 23rd Secretary of  Defense.  On a final note, Secretary Gates will  soon take leave from his post at the  Pentagon, and I believe that he will be  remembered for his consummate role  in transforming our Nation’s military  from a force that focused on Cold War  operations to one that was capable of  defeating threats in Iraq and Afghanistan, while possessing the  flexibility  necessary to successfully carry out a  mission like the one that killed bin  Laden.  As Secretary Gates prepares to depart public life, I would like to thank  him for the countless sacrifices he has  made over a lifetime of contributions  to the nation, which includes serving  eight Presidents, as well as the distinctions of being the only Secretary of Defense in U.S. history asked to remain  in that office by a newly elected President, and the only career officer in the  CIA’s history to rise from entry-level  employee to Director. These two stand-  out achievements speak volumes about  Secretary Gates’ work ethic and love of  country. Our country and our security  have been forever enhanced by his dedication to public service, and I wish him  well in his future endeavors.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2011

1256,54,2011-06-21,Mr. MANCHIN.," Mr. President, I have  the utmost  respect  for  the Senator  from Arizona and his commitment to  this country and his service to this  country.  I can only report what I have seen. I  was in Afghanistan twice—as a Governor in 2006, representing the National  Guard of West Virginia, and I went  back in 2010. While there, I saw deterioration. I did not see a country that had  an infrastructure and an economy. I  saw  corrupt  leadership and nothing  good coming of it.  With that, I know that the Senator  has had much more experience. I can  only speak from common sense and for  the people of West Virginia about what  they feel. We are a very hawkish State  and a patriotic State. If 10 years is not  enough, how long is enough—I think  that is the question being asked—for  the sacrifices being asked of them?  When we cannot buy water lines and  sewer  lines or  fix  roads and  repair  bridges in West Virginia, yet they hear  about the billions we are spending in a  country that doesn’t want us there, I  think it is time to leave.  Respectfully, that might be the disagreement we have.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2011

1260,61,2011-06-21,Mr. CASEY.," Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about our policy in Afghanistan. We know the President is  about to announce a major decision on  the policy. As the President determines  the degree and scope of the drawdown  in Afghanistan, there will be a lot of  debate, about troop levels, principally.  But while this is an important discussion, we need to step back and comprehensively focus on overall U.S. strategic interests in the region.  Over the course of my time in the  Senate, some 41⁄2years now, I have participated in more than 20 Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Afghanistan and Pakistan. This week we will  hear  from Secretary Clinton on the  U.S. policy on both Afghanistan and  Pakistan.  I  personally  chaired  four  hearings on U.S. policy in the region, I  have traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan on two occasions, and met with  our military and civilian leadership as  well as senior government officials in  both countries. I have spoken repeatedly on the Senate floor about the importance of accountability of U.S. military and civilian programs.  When it comes to matters of war, the  Senate has a special responsibility to  ask questions and to hold the executive  branch accountable no matter what  party is in the White House. I have  taken this responsibility very seriously  and have repeatedly questioned and examined U.S. policy in south Asia.  There has been substantial progress  in Afghanistan. On the battlefield, the  United States coalition and Afghan  forces have rolled back advances made  by the Taliban. We have made measurable, albeit fragile, gains on security in  key provinces of the country. Al-Qaida,  operating from Pakistan, has been significantly degraded.  There  has  also  been measurable  progress in the education and health  fields. Only 900,000 boys and no girls attended school under the Taliban. Today  more than 6 million children are  in  school and a third of them are girls. In  the field of health, more than 85 percent of Afghans now have access to at  least some form of health care, up from  9 percent in the year 2002.  These gains have not come without  immeasurable sacrifice on the part of  our Armed Forces and of course their  families. In Pennsylvania we have lost  30 servicemembers killed in action in  Operation  Enduring  Freedom  since  2001. To date, 461 have been wounded,  some of them grievously wounded.  In Iraq, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania lost 197 servicemembers killed  in  action  and  1,233 were wounded.  These courageous men and women gave  what many years ago Lincoln called  ‘‘the last full measure of devotion’’ to  their country. We owe them a debt of  gratitude. We owe the same debt of  gratitude to their families and to all  veterans and their families returning  from the battlefield.  After  this  exhaustive  review, and  based upon measurable gains  in Afghanistan, I believe the United States  can shift from a strategy of counterinsurgency toward an increased focus on  counterterrorism.  It  is time  for the  United States to lighten its footprint  in the country. It is also a time to accelerate the shift in responsibility to  Afghan forces and for a drawdown of a  significant number of United States  troops from Afghanistan. The capabilities of both al-Qaida and the Taliban  have been severely degraded.

This event will  feature music performed by the David Pernell Ensemble as a  preview  to  the Smithsonian’s annual Folklife  Festival. This year, one of the Folklife Festival  themes is Rhythm and Blues: Tell It Like It Is.  The 2011 Smithsonian Folklife Festival will  celebrate  the people and culture of R & B  music  in  the United States. R & B encompasses jump blues, soul, funk and more contemporary styles and is recognized throughout  the world as one of the most identifiably American forms of popular music. The Festival program will explore the social and cultural history integral to the development of R & B and  will present not only performances, but also  conversations and discussions with some of  the artists,  songwriters,  radio personalities,  and others who have worked behind  the  scenes to produce the music.  From June 30th–July 4 and from July 7–11,  the Rhythm and Blues: Tell It Like It Is program will consist of two large covered stages  on the National Mall and a smaller discussion/  narrative stage, highlighting select styles associated with African American urban centers in  the United States. Through performance and  narrative presentations, Festival visitors will  discover  exciting  connections  between  different  forms of musical performance, social  dance, the recording industry, and broadcast  radio—all of which accompanied and contributed to shaping the musical heritage of R & B.  The program is being produced in partnership  between the Smithsonian’s Center for Folklife  and Cultural Heritage,  the Folklife Festival,  and the National Museum of African American  History and Culture.  I encourage my colleagues and their staff to  take a few minutes and enjoy some great R &  B  music  today  as  a  preview  to  the  Smithsonian’s 2011 Folklife Festival.  f  REMEMBERING LAURENCE  BUTLER DILLARD  HON. ERIC CANTOR  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 21, 2011  ",2011
1262,75,2011-06-21,Mr. CANTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor the memory and legacy of an individual  that served this body, the Commonwealth of  Virginia and our Nation  tirelessly  for many,  many years, Mr. Laurence Butler Dillard, who  most of us came to know simply as Larry.  I had the pleasure of meeting Larry many  years ago, during the early days of my own  journey in public service. Larry proudly served  the people of Virginia’s 3d Congressional District in the office of my friend and colleague,  BOBBYSCOTT. With Larry’s passing, Congressman SCOTT’s office has lost not just an employee, but a  friend, and  I offer my condolences to Representative SCOTTand his entire  staff.  Larry’s quest  for knowledge and genuine  appreciation  for history, especially Virginia’s  history and culture, was infectious to all that  had the pleasure of interacting with him.  In an environment that is often described as  unyieldingly partisan, Larry’s approach to the  legislative system and constituent service was  indeed refreshing. His unique ability to overcome differences, backed up by his positive  and enthusiastic personality, bridged the parties together and remains a model for all of  us. And that’s how Larry was—never deterred,  no issue insurmountable, always finding that  common ground. He devoted his  life  to  the  service of others.  I hope this body will join me in offering sincere condolences to Larry’s wife Sherry, his  son Brandon, his brother Randy, Congressman SCOTT and his staff and Larry’s many  family members and  friends. Larry Dillard’s  contributions to this institution will always be  remembered.  f  PROCLAMATION  FOR  COLTON  BULLARD,  RECIPIENT  OF  THE  ‘‘2011  LITTLE  LEAGUE  INTERNATIONAL’S  GOOD  SPORT  OF  THE YEAR AWARD’’  HON.

In particular,  I  would like to commend the achievements of  Brooks Byers of Flower Mound, Texas. Mr.  Byers is the newest winner of The Congressional Award Gold Medal, Congress’s only  and very prestigious award for youth.  Earning the Gold Medal requires great commitment and devotion to service; each award-  winner must spend two or more years completing more  than 400 hours of community  service Mr. Byers’s service projects included  organizing youth tennis camps and gift-wrapping fundraisers to raise more than $3,000 for  Susan G. Komen for the Cure, tutoring at-risk  children each week and  raising money  for  their after-school program  through a book  drive, and organizing homecoming celebrations for soldiers each weekend as part of the  Welcome Home a Hero Program.  Mr. Byers’s accomplishments do not end  here. The Congressional Award Gold Medal  also  requires participants  to  complete 200  hours of personal development and physical  fitness activities, which Brooks fulfilled through  a junior golf league and his high school’s tennis team. For the Expedition part of the Gold  Medal program, Brooks planned a trip to enrich his understanding of ancient European  history in Scotland and France.  The Congressional Award Gold Medal recognizes youth who show great  initiative and  an inspiring ability to reach complex, self-imposed goals. This experience, what Mr. Byers  himself calls  ‘‘transformative’’, shows an  incredible commitment  to excellence and  the  principles of our country’s future leaders. It is  an honor  for me  to have  the opportunity  to  recognize and represent Mr. Brooks Byers.  f  A TRIBUTE TO JOSE´R. SA´NCHEZ  HON.

1269,89,2011-06-21,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, June 18, 2011, the  people of Dallas, Texas and the United States  suffered a great loss with the passing of Al  Lipscomb. Al Lipscomb was a strong community leader, businessman and a devoted public  servant. He was never afraid of controversy;  he was a true advocate for peace, racial justice, and social equality. He was 86 years old.  Mr. Lipscomb was born in East Dallas. He  was educated in the Dallas public schools, attending Booker T. Washington High School  and graduating from Lincoln High. He joined  the Army Air Force in California with the military police in 1943. He returned to Dallas in  1950, married and became the head waiter in  the executive dining room of the First National  Bank. He was reprimanded by his boss after  going  to  the courthouse  to watch Thurgood  Marshall  file a Dallas school desegregation  case.  In 1966, he became a neighborhood organizer for the Dallas Community Action Agency.  He was also an organizer for the Dallas chapter of Dr. King’s Southern Christian Leadership  Conference.  Al  Lipscomb  is  known  for  filing  a  groundbreaking  lawsuit  that  forced Dallas  to  elect council members by individual districts.  He served on the city council for 15 years and  was  the  first black person  to run  for Dallas  mayor.  In 1972, Mr. Lipscomb opened  the South  Dallas Information Center on Pennsylvania Avenue, where he handled a constant stream of  phone calls and questions  from passersby  seeking assistance. The center was supported  by donations. He also kept a high profile by  making the rounds at public meetings, asking  tough questions, and offering suggestions.  In 1984, he was elected to the City Council  and became a vocal critic of the Dallas Police  Department’s  treatment of minorities. And  in  the late 1980s, Mr. Lipscomb and Ms. Diane  Ragsdale—the only black members of  the  council—drew national media attention and  local death threats. Despite the hostilities toward him, he remained both a critic and a  skeptic of  the city he  loved.  ‘‘I see a great  change,’’ he said.  ‘‘I see a great change, a  change for the better.’’  Al was a man of great commitment. He provided tremendous support for me as a public  official. I am deeply grateful for his counsel,  support, assistance, and unquestionable trusted friendship.  I remember him as being extremely affable,  charismatic, and passionate about the needs  of community. For all of us he was as one of  the most accessible elected officials, always  available to listen and reach out to us in addressing complex  issues  in a hands-on and  collaborative fashion.  Today, Texas’s 30th Congressional District  salutes and honors Al Lipscomb. We  thank  Mr. Lipscomb’s wife, Lovie, his children, and  his grandchildren  for sharing his exuberant  and compassionate spirit with us. His family  was always supportive and understanding of  his  commitment. His  fight  for  justice and  equality should not, can not, and will not be  forgotten.  f  HONORING NATHAN CHARLES  DARRAH  HON.

Over the  many years Nathan has been  involved with  scouting, he has not only earned numerous  merit badges, but also the respect of his family, peers, and community. Most notably, Nathan has contributed to his community through  his Eagle Scout project. Nathan reclaimed and  built over a mile of hiking  trail around Lake  Jacomo in Jackson County, Missouri.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  commending Nathan Charles Darrah  for his  accomplishments with  the Boy Scouts  of  America and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.  f  RECOGNIZING  THE  DEDICATED  SERVICE OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL  DONALD  C.  WURSTER,  UNITED STATES AIR FORCE  HON. JEFF MILLER  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 21, 2011  ",2011
1271,89,2011-06-21,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to recognize the service of Lieutenant  General Donald C. Wurster upon his retirement from the United States Air Force.  For over 38 years of service to our nation,  Lieutenant General Donald Wurster lived the  core values of  Integrity First, Service before  Self, and Excellence in All We Do. On June  24, 2011 General Wurster relinquishes command of Air Force Special Operations Command and leaves behind a hallmark of accomplishments generated  through his  leadership  of some of America’s finest men and women.  Since his graduation from the United States  Air Force Academy, he has been a part of  some  of  the most  dynamic  changes  in  airpower’s history. Along  the way, General  Wurster’s vision and leadership helped usher  in some of the most unique warfighting capabilities  in  the Air Force. From counter-insurgency leadership to building aviation programs  that provided national power any  time, any  place, his legacy will remain one of steadfast  dedication.  As a  tip-of-the-spear helicopter pilot, General Wurster amassed more than 4,000 flying  hours,  including assignments  in both rescue  and special operations. During his career, he  commanded special operations units at  the  squadron, group, wing, joint task force, sub-  unified command, and finally Air Force major  command level where he led over 16,000 personnel executing missions across the globe in  support of national interests and objectives.  Throughout his career, his wife Ronda has  been there every step of the way. For over the  three and a half decades, Ronda supported  her husband, their growing family, and the fellow men and women who have chosen  to  wear the uniform as protectors of our nation’s  freedom. She has been there in times of celebration for graduations, promotions, and unit  gatherings, as well as during the difficult times  when someone has been lost or injured in the  line of duty.  Let it be recognized that in a time of persistent combat and other military operations,  the United States Air Force had the right guy,  in the right place, at the right time. Furthermore, his leadership and framework for success has helped build a strong following of talented warriors ready to protect our nation.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States  Congress, I am honored to congratulate General Wurster on his retirement. My wife Vicki  and I wish him and Ronda all the best for continued success.  f  AGE NOT AN ISSUE FOR  BASEBALL’S JACK MCKEON  HON. HOWARD COBLE  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 21, 2011  ",2011
1272,89,2011-06-21,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, many senior citizens who  travel  to Florida are doing so  to  enjoy  the  retired  life after years of working  while filling their days with hours spent on the  beach. Jack McKeon, from the Sixth District of  North Carolina, crushes this stereotype as he  begins his second term as manager of baseball’s Florida Marlins.  McKeon has the full support of his family to  leave his home in the town of Elon to return  to the world of professional baseball, a move  that makes him the second-oldest manager in  history. This  calculated  return  comes with  pressure as McKeon  led  the Marlins  to  the  2003 World Series championship. His age is  sometimes  criticized,  but  the  80-year-old  McKeon said,  ‘‘I  look at  it  this way—why  should experience get penalized?  I’ve managed since I was 14 years old. I’ll probably  manage until I’m 95.’’  Marlins president of baseball operations,  Larry  Beinfest,  said,  ‘‘It’s  good  to  see  [McKeon] back. He never really left. We turn  to him to help us at a very difficult time.’’ The  Florida Marlins seem to be in need of McKeon  after a recent 10-game losing streak and the  resignation of  former manager Edwin Rodriguez. McKeon  is passionate and optimistic  about his return and has high hopes for the  coming  season.  ‘‘I  don’t  need  this  job,’’  McKeon said, ‘‘but I love it.’’  From one octogenarian to another, and on  behalf of the citizens of the Sixth District of  North Carolina, we congratulate Jack McKeon  on  resuming his duties as manager of  the  Florida Marlins and wish him the best of luck  for the remainder of this season and for however long he wishes to manage. We know that  whenever he retires for good, we are sure that  it will be in the Sixth District of North Carolina.

1273,18,2011-06-27,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President, I would  like to congratulate a group of exceptional students and teachers from the  State of Hawaii for their participation  in the 2011 Kenneth E. Behring National History Day Contest. This year’s  theme, ‘‘Debate and Diplomacy in History:  Successes,  Failure,  Consequences,’’ was the starting point for  student projects nationwide.  The National History Day, NHD, is a  highly regarded academic program for  elementary and secondary school students. Each year, over a half a million  students participate in the NHD contest where students choose historical  topics related to a theme and conduct  extensive primary and secondary research through libraries, archives, museums, oral history interviews and historic sites. Once students draw their  conclusions about their topics’ significance  in history, they present their  work in original papers, Web sites, exhibits,  performances  and  documentaries. The projects are entered into  competitions in the spring at local and  state levels where they are evaluated  by  professional historians  and  educators. National History Day  culminates with the Kenneth E. Behring  National Contest at the University of  Maryland at College Park each June.  This year, two student teams from  Hawaii  received  national  honors.  Kamaile Aluli, Kaylee Alana Miller  and Truman Spring from Laie Elementary School placed first in the junior  Web site competition with their entry  titled,  ‘‘Between a Rock and a Hard  Place: the Battle over Hetch Hetchy.’’  Their teachers are Serena Tuliloa and  Colleen Spring. Moanalua High School  students Janal Kim, Keri Ann Nagaishi  and Kelly Zakimi took second place for  their senior group exhibit, ‘‘Creation of  Pakistan.’’ Their  teacher  is Angela  Brooks.  As a former educator, I am pleased to  see our keiki succeeding on a national  level. Throughout my career in Congress, I have worked closely with my  colleagues to ensure that students in  Hawaii and the nation have quality  teachers,  schools and academic programs. The Kenneth E. Behring National History Day Contest is one such  program that offers children who have  a passion for history, a way of rewarding them for their hard work.  Once again I offer my sincere congratulations and aloha to all the students and teachers who participated in  the 2011 Kenneth E. Behring National  History Day Contest and wish them all  success in their academic futures.∑  f  AWWA PIPE TAPPING CHAMPIONS  ∑",2011
1274,18,2011-06-27,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President, I wish to  congratulate  the Honolulu Board of  Water Supply, HBWS, women’s team  that won the American Water Works  Association, AWWA, Pipe Tapping Contest in Washington, DC, on June 15,  2011. Known as the Wahine, the HBWS  women captured the first place title for  a second year in a row at the 130th  AWWA Annual Conference with a time  of 2:35.81 minutes. This was the third  AWWA Championship  for  the  team,  having won in 2010 and 2005.  The Wahine faced off against four rivals  in a contest where top utility  teams race to tap a cement-lined, ductile  iron pipe. The women of HBWS  demonstrated amazing skill and showcased the expertise of AWWA members.  The HBWS Wahine  includes  Cat  Sawai, setter, Susan Oda, copper, and  Danielle Ornellas, cranker. The team  was led by coach Gary Fernandez.  I congratulate the Honolulu Board of  Water Supply Wahine on their accomplishment, and I wish all of them the  best in their future endeavors. I extend  the same congratulations to all members of the Honolulu Board of Water  Supply who participated in this year’s  AWWA Conference on a job well done.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO LARRY AND BARBI  WEINBERG  ∑",2011
1275,18,2011-06-27,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, Winston  Churchill once said, ‘‘We make a living  by what we get, but we make a life by  what we give.’’ Today  I honor  two  great Americans who have made a wonderful life by what they have given.  Lawrence and Barbara Weinberg, or  Larry and Barbi as their family and  friends know them, have given much to  their faith, to their country, and to  their family and friends. Today I call  attention to their service that the good  life they have made can serve as an example to us all.  Larry answered our Nation’s call to  duty and served in the U.S. Infantry in  France during World War II. He was  nearly killed by the explosion of a  landmine. While he was injured on the  ground, a German soldier bayonetted  him in the stomach. He remained motionless and isolated for over thirteen  hours. Against all odds, he was rescued  by a Catholic Army Chaplain and spent  a year recovering in the hospital.  After Larry was  discharged  from  both the hospital and the Army, he  met Barbi. It was the summer of 1946.  They married 6 months  later. Larry  then  started  a Los Angeles homebuilding business. He began with just  four houses, but built his company to  become the Larwin Group Companies,  the largest privately owned single-family housing producer  in  the United  States. He later became the principal  owner and CEO of the Portland Trailblazers from 1975–1988, and served on  the board of governors of the National  Basketball Association from 1980–1983.  Together, Larry and Barbi have been  unwavering supporters of the Jewish  community and Israel. In 1973, Barbi  was elected president of the Jewish  Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles, becoming the first woman to be  elected president of a major federation  in the United States. She used her position to expand the previously secular  Foundation to Orthodox, Conservative,  and Reformed Jewish congregations.  Larry also continued his work supporting the American-Israeli relationship. He was elected president of the  American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, in 1976 for 5 years, later  serving as its chairman from 1982–1987.  He is known as the founder of modern  AIPAC.  Larry established the Jewish Foundation Barbi Weinberg Chai Award to  honor individuals who have made an  outstanding contribution  to  the enhancement of and appreciation for Jewish life. Barbi sponsored a program to  prepare junior and senior high school  students with  the knowledge,  confidence, and training to speak up for  themselves and for Israel, and to fight  anti-Semitism and anti-Israel bias on  college campuses. These programs are  so important for our Nation’s youth.  In  1984, Barbi  founded  the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.  This research foundation has become  one of the most influential think tanks  in Washington, advising policymakers  on Middle East issues.  Larry and Barbi have lived a life of  dedicated public service. They are most  proud, however, of their loving dedication to their family. During their 64  years together, Larry and Barbi have 4  children, 12 grandchildren, and 3 great-  grandchildren. All  are hardworking,  successful Americans that share Larry  and Barbi’s  commitment  to  public  service.  Larry and Barbi truly have made a  good life by what they have given. I am  proud to consider myself a friend. And  may their service be an example to us  all.∑  f  LUBEC, MAINE  ∑",2011
1276,18,2011-06-27,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, Lubec,  ME, is the easternmost town in the  United States, the place where the rising Sun first shines on America. That  unique geographic location has special  meaning in this, Lubec’s bicentennial  year. Today, as they have for two centuries, the people of Lubec greet every  day with the optimism and determination each dawn brings.  Located on a slender peninsula that  separates Passamaquoddy Bay and the  Atlantic Ocean, Lubec is more than a  town on the sea. It is a town of the sea.  Its 95 miles of shoreline once were lined  with cargo-filled docks, shipyards, sail  makers, canneries, smokehouses, and  tide-powered sawmills. Its namesake,  Lubeck, Germany, was chosen to emulate that ancient seafaring city’s role  as a center of open and free trade. The  magnificent  sea  captain  homes  throughout the town stand as monuments to Lubec’s role as an early hub  of America’s global commerce.  Now, it is a shoreline of aquaculture  pens,  lobster  traps, and urchin and  scallop boats.

1277,6,2011-07-11,Mr. TURNER.," Mr. Chair, this House  has three times previously confirmed  our commitment to fully funding the  NNSA activities. I would urge that as  we go through the process of this bill  that this funding be restored.  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw  the amendment.  ",2011
1278,6,2011-07-11,Mr. MCKEON.," Mr. Chair, I rise in support of  my colleague’s amendment to restore funding  to the defense activities of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). In May,  the House overwhelmingly passed—by a vote  of 322 to 96—the Fiscal Year 2012 National  Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA  recognized the critical need to shore up our  nuclear security enterprise and authorized full  funding for NNSA.  Unfortunately, the appropriations bill before  us reduces the NNSA budget by $1.1 billion  from the level authorized by the NDAA. The  funding level authorized by the NDAA was a  key component of a deal between the Administration and Congress. This deal would finally,  after decades of neglect,  reinvigorate and  modernize our nuclear security enterprise  to  ensure  the safety, security, and reliability of  our nuclear weapons in exchange for the nuclear  force reductions contained  in  the New  START  treaty. The 10% NNSA budget cut  proposed by  this bill greatly endangers  this  modernization, and reneges on this deal.  I recognize  that  the offset  in  this amendment  is difficult  for many of my colleagues.  Unfortunately, there are no easy offsets within  the energy and water bill.  Through my committee, Armed Services,  the House authorizes all defense  funding—  both for the Department of Defense and the  NNSA. We must recognize that NNSA is defense spending, and treat it as such. As Secretary Gates  told my committee earlier  this  year, NNSA’s work  is  ‘‘incredibly  important’’  and is, ‘‘intimately tied to our national security  and should be regarded as part of the security  component.’’  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support national defense, and restore funding for  NNSA.  The CHAIR. Without objection, the  amendment is withdrawn.  There was no objection.  AMENDMENTOFFEREDBYMR. TIERNEY  ",2011

1281,6,2011-07-11,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Chairman, this is  a revised amendment that deals with  the objection raised by the chairman  on the previous amendment that was  proposed on this matter. It still gets to  the fundamental issue here, that we  need to restore the Army Corps of Engineer budgets here through the Construction and Operation and Maintenance accounts to the point of at least  where it was in fiscal year 2011.  We have serious issues confronting  our economy. This is a way to make  sure that the Corps has the resources it  needs  to  deal with  its  numerous  issues—our  ports,  dealing with  our  economy, moving the cargo, and essentially putting people to work, and also  protecting the homes and the welfare  of people that  live along ways that  need dredging or that need jetties repaired that haven’t been repaired for  decade after decade.  While I understand that the chairman had a difficult role and opportunity was limited due to the amount  of money that was allocated for him  and this committee, and I respect what  he tried to do, simply speaking, I think  we have the choices to make here, and  those choices are to protect the interests of people, to make sure that we  get people back to work, to give the  Army Corps  the  resources  that  it  needs, at the same time reducing other  accounts by a rather minimal amount  so that we effect our purposes without  causing too much destruction to programs that other people may favor.

1285,6,2011-07-11,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Chairman,  move to strike the last word.  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2011
1286,6,2011-07-11,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Chairman, I do  not know if a point or order will be insisted upon, I do not know if it will be  prevailed upon, but I would want to  make  a  comment  relative  to  the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from Massachusetts.  I agree with everything  that Mr.  has  said—and more—during  committee and during the general debate on this floor. I mentioned that in  the 2009 report card on America’s infrastructure,  the American Society  of  Civil Engineers estimated an  investment shortfall of $2.2 trillion that is  necessary to bring our Nation’s infrastructure up to good condition.  Additionally, the engineering society  gave our Nation’s dams, levees and inland waterways grades of D or D minus.  I want to use my time because we  have had a  lot of discussion—and  I  have joined in that discussion—about  the inadequate allocation that the subcommittee has been given.  I would also point out that there is  another failure, and that is the budget  request itself. And the subcommittee  has taken note of that on page 13 of  their report by stating that the budget  request by the President represents a  level of investment, as with previous  budget requests, that is not reflective  of the Corps’  importance to the national economy,  jobs, or our  international competitiveness. And further,  the committee urges the administration to take into account while developing a special request the extraordinary  economic  benefits  of  the  projects  historically  funded  in  the  Corps  accounts, which,  again,  jibes  with exactly the points that the gentleman from Massachusetts has said.  So I am in agreement with the gentleman. This  is woefully  inadequate.  The administration bears a blame here  as well. But I also must add my voice  to the chairman’s and respectfully oppose the amendment simply because we  are in a very tight situation with this  bill and we prefer that the amendment  not be adopted, despite the relevance of  it and the correctness of the gentleman’s position from Massachusetts.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

1294,13,2011-07-11,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN., I reserve a  point  of  order  on  the  gentleman’s  amendment.  The CHAIR. The point of order is reserved.  The gentleman from Connecticut is  recognized for 5 minutes.  b1530  ,2011
1295,13,2011-07-11,Mr. COURTNEY.," Mr. Chairman, this  amendment  is  simple.  It would  increase the Army Corps of Engineers operations and maintenance budget by  $808 million in 2012. This number is not  a random number that was just picked  out of the air. This number represents  the difference between the tax revenue  collected through the harbor maintenance tax and the amount of money  that is actually being spent out of the  harbor maintenance trust fund for the  purpose of maintaining and dredging  America’s harbors.  Again, for some listeners it might be  helpful to understand that in 1986, the  Congress passed a harbor maintenance  tax, which is a tax—it is really a user  fee—on  imported goods coming  into  America’s harbors all across this country, East Coast, West Coast, all across  the coastlines of the United States of  America. The purpose of that tax was  to create a fund to dredge harbors so  we would have passable waterways.  Again, we have heard over and over  this afternoon, that is good for the U.S.  economy.  What has happened since 1986 is the  revenue collected through the harbor  maintenance  tax has gone up at a  steady rate. It has gone up 13 percent  just in the last year because there are  a lot more imported goods coming into  this country, but the funding for actual  dredging has plateaued. It has been at  a level pace so that today, we have a  budget which calls for using only 53  percent  of  the harbor maintenance  taxes  collected  for  the purposes of  dredging  America’s  harbors.  This  would be like having only 53 percent of  our gas taxes being spent on surface  transportation in this country. If motorists saw only 53 percent of gas taxes  being actually used to maintain roads  in this country, there would be a revolution, because there is a promise in  terms of Federal gas taxes that it will  be used to maintain surface transportation.  Well, that was the equivalent idea  under  the  harbor maintenance  tax  passed in 1986, that it would be used to  invest and reinvest in America’s harbors.  Because we are,  in  fact, diverting  year in and year out hundreds of millions of dollars out of the harbor maintenance tax away  from  its  intended  purpose, we have what we have seen  here  this afternoon. We have heard  from Members  from Massachusetts,  from New York,  Louisiana,  South  Carolina, and New Jersey.  I can chime in from Connecticut. We  have about $113 million of dredging  that is underfunded from Bridgeport all  of the way to Stonington. And I know  the gentleman from New Jersey is familiar with the fact that we are on the  silty side of Long Island Sound. Again,  we have a Navy base which requires  dredging  to  keep  our  attack  submarines going in and out of New London. But we also have a maritime economy that depends on having these Federal waterways dredged.  The budget that we will be passing  this year, whether it is the President’s  budget or whether it is the one that the  subcommittee  has  reported  out,  is  clearly inadequate in terms of making  sure that our waterways are passable.  As we have heard from other Members, because of the increase in terms  of imports, whether we pass these new  free trade agreements or not, the expansion of the Panama Canal is going  to  double  the  amount  of  imports  brought in by sea into this country,  and we have a system that is clearly  inadequate  in terms of dealing with  that challenge.  Now there is legislation pending before the Congress. I am a cosponsor  with  the gentleman  from Louisiana  (Mr. BOUSTANY). It is called the RAMP  Act.  It  is an acronym  for Restore  America’s  Maritime  Promise  Act,  which is a grandiose title, but it is  true. We need to make sure that these  harbor maintenance taxes are being directed to their intended purpose when  that tax was created in 1986. What the  RAMP Act will do is basically cordon  off this tax revenue so that it is used  for the intended purpose that Congress  meant when it was passed in 1986.  What that will do is it will take pressure off  this  subcommittee’s budget  year in and year out. Again, it will deal  with this problem that has worsened,  as the subcommittee chairman mentioned, because earmarks are now a  thing of the past in terms of dealing  with dredging projects. What it will do  is create a stable flow of money into  the Army Corps of Engineers harbor  maintenance dredging fund so that all  of these projects that we have heard  about this afternoon—again, from one  end of the country to the other—are  actually going to be paid for. We have  over 100 bipartisan cosponsors.  The Transportation Committee had a  hearing this past Friday, and it does  appear from Mr. MICA that they are  going to move  forward  in terms of  adopting the RAMP Act as part of the  transportation authorization bill.  This amendment, again, puts a spotlight on the fact that only 53 percent of  the harbor maintenance tax revenue is  being used for its intended purpose, and  that is the reason why I have offered  this amendment.

I share my colleague’s concern for  sufficiently maintaining  our waterways. These waterways contribute significantly to our national economy by  providing  a means  of  cost-effective  cargo transportation. In recognition of  the economic benefits of navigation  generally and maintenance dredging  specifically, the bill before us provides  funds above the President’s budget request for navigation needs—$191 million in total and $99 million specifically  for the operation and maintenance  activities. This  funding  represents a 12 percent increase over the  President’s own budget for navigation.  I also agree with the gentleman from  Connecticut’s idea that if the Federal  Government levies a tax for a specific  purpose, the revenue should be used for  that purpose. Unfortunately, the only  way to do that at this point would be  to make  substantial  reductions  in  other priorities in our bill.

1310,20,2011-07-11,Mr. MCINTYRE.," Madam Chairman,  under the Water Resources Development Act, which we know as WRDA, of  1986, Congress authorized most coastal  and shoreline protection and beach restoration projects  to be periodically  nourished according to a cost-sharing  agreement between the Federal Government and a local sponsor, usually a  municipality, for a period of up to 50  years from the starting date of the initial construction of the project.  Several of these projects are rapidly  approaching the end of that first 50-  year period of Federal participation.  Currently,  there  is no  language  in  place to provide a process for the reauthorization of these projects.  In order for the Federal Government  to remain a continuing partner to protect the people, the infrastructure, the  economy, and the environment of our  Nation’s  coastal  communities, Congress must give the Army Corps of Engineers the authority to assess continued Federal participation in expiring  beach and coastal projects prior to the  end of their original authorizations in  order to prevent interruptions to Federal renourishment efforts.  This authority would  ensure  that  communities’  shorelines will  remain  safe and economically viable for years  to come by letting the Army Corps and  the local communities help determine  whether or not to continue a shore protection project based on science, on  local support, and the standards that  the Corps uses for determining whether  there should be continued Federal fiscal participation and whether it is warranted.  These projects are of national and regional  significance.  Coastal  storm  damage  reduction projects not only  support  regional economies and,  indeed, the national economy, but they  provide critical protection against hurricanes and, as we now are in hurricane  season, realize the seriousness of this  and other dangerous storms.  Federal  participation  in  these  projects is determined based on a benefit-cost analysis, meaning that these  projects go through a significant study  in order to determine that they are  merited and that it is in the Federal  Government’s financial interest to continue to participate in these projects.  However,  let’s be  clear  that  this  amendment would not cut Congress out  of the loop, because Congress would always have the final say on final approval of reauthorizing these projects.  Any approval for a construction phase  would still have to be approved by Congress. So it only makes sense to allow  these  projects  to  proceed without  interruption.  Madam Chairman, I yield back the  balance of my time.  POINTOFORDER  ",2011

I share the gentleman’s support for  the Corps of Engineers’ participation in  beach replenishment projects that provide protection from coastal storms for  individuals  and  businesses.  Coming  from a State with 137 miles of shoreline, I too understand the importance  of these projects to local, regional, and  our national economy.  The  amendment  offered,  however,  would add authorizing language to the  Energy and Water bill; therefore, it is  subject to a point of order.  So while I am sympathetic to the  gentleman’s intent, I must oppose the  amendment and insist on my point of  order.

1312,27,2011-07-11,Mr. DOYLE.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself 5 minutes.  I rise in opposition to this bill. I was  on the committee back in 2007 when we  first wrote  the  efficiency  standards  that Republicans are trying to repeal  here today. The way I remember it, our  current chairman, Mr. UPTON,  introduced the bill to set the standards. Our  former House Speaker, Dennis Hastert,  supported it, along with many Republicans. And, finally, President George  W. Bush signed these standards into  law.  In fact, if you look at the history behind consensus efficiency standard, you  will see that this used to be something  that we all agreed upon. Beginning  with President Reagan  in 1987, Congress and the White House have enacted Federal energy efficiency standards five times, each time with bipartisan support. These standards were developed as consensus agreements with  manufacturers, energy efficiency advocates, and States.  There’s more than 50 products on the  market today that are covered by a variety of these Federal standards. Everything from dishwashers and refrigerators to traffic signals have become  more efficient as a result of these Federal standards, saving the country energy and saving consumers money.  These standards have been in effect  since 1987, have saved Americans about  3.6 quads of energy. If we continue with  enacting Federal efficiency standards,  we can save up to 6.1 quads of energy  by 2030. That is more energy than was  used in my State of Pennsylvania in  2008. The light bulb efficiency standards alone will save Pennsylvania 3.64  billion kilowatt hours of energy in a  year. That means we’ll save $465 million  in Pennsylvania  in  just 1 year  from these standards.  In Congress we don’t always agree on  much; but for the last 25 years, we have  been able to agree on energy efficiency.  And it’s been good for the country and  for American families and for the environment. So why would we wish to reverse this policy today? But you know,  energy and cost savings aren’t the only  benefits from these standards.  Having lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, my whole life, I have seen how  efficiency can revolutionize an industry and revitalize a city. In the seventies, I worked two summers at J & L  steel mill on Pittsburgh’s south side.  The industry was doing well, and Pittsburgh was a company town. But in a  few years, that  industry came to a  screeching halt as international competitors were making steel using new  technologies and more efficient processes, allowing them to undercut the  price of U.S. steel. But the steel industry didn’t leave the United States, and  it  didn’t  leave  Pittsburgh.  It  reinvented  itself.  It got  smarter and  leaner and more energy efficient.  U.S. steelmakers started using blast  oxygen furnaces rather than old open  hearth furnaces that used more energy.  They started doing continuous casting  rather than ingots and molds that required reheating. They started using  waste heat recovery and energy monitoring and management technologies.  As a result, the U.S. steel industry has  reduced the amount of energy needed  to produce a ton of steel by 33 percent  since 1990.  The  lighting  industry has already  begun to revolutionize, much like the  industrial steel industry did back in  the nineties. When the industry agreed  to these efficiency standards in 2007, it  was because they knew they could innovate and still be profitable by making the  incandescent bulb, yes, colleagues, the incandescent bulb more efficient  and  developing  new  technologies like compact fluorescents and  LED light bulbs. And even better, the  lighting industry began making those  bulbs right here in the United States of  America. Even in Pennsylvania, Sylvania retooled a plant in St. Mary’s,  Pennsylvania, to make these incandescent light bulbs that meet the energy  efficiency standards that we passed in  2007.  b1740  They are being made in the United  States by United States steelworkers  in Pennsylvania, and you  can  find  them on your shelf at the grocery store  or the hardware store. Or you can get  these Philips bulbs, also incandescent  light bulbs, colleagues. They meet the  energy standards that were set in 2007.  Steelworkers are making  the  filaments  in these bulbs  in Bath, New  York. In fact, United Steelworkers is  opposing this bill and telling us at a  time when Americans continue to experience downward  financial pressures,  energy-efficient light bulbs present an  everyday solution to a much-needed  cost savings.  But it’s not just steelworkers that  are benefiting. Light bulbs that meet  these standards are being made all over  the United States of America. In 2011,  TCP, one of the world’s largest makers  of CFLs, is opening a new factory in  Ohio.  The SPEAKER pro  tempore  (Mrs.  MILLERof Michigan). The time of the  gentleman has expired.  ",2011
1313,27,2011-07-11,Mr. DOYLE.," I yield myself 30 additional seconds.  CFL is making a new factory in Ohio  to meet the demand. Seven thousand  U.S. jobs have been created by companies like Cree in North Carolina, Lighting Science Group  in Florida,  and  Lighting Philips Company, the world’s  biggest lighting company, to produce  the next generation of efficient LED  light bulbs. GE recently invested $60  million to create a Global Center of  Excellence for linear fluorescent lamp  manufacturing in Bucyrus, Ohio, an action that will double the number of  jobs there.  New innovation and energy efficiency  has brought jobs to this country. This  is not the time to repeal these standards.  UNITEDSTEELWORKERS,  Washington, DC, July 11, 2011.

1314,34,2011-07-11,Mr. HONDA.," Mr. Speaker,  I am appalled  that  the Republican majority  in  the House  would even craft a bill such as the BULB Act,  much less actually bring it to the floor for a  vote. This bill  is based on  inaccurate and  downright false claims like the one made by  the Wall Street Journal when it outrageously  tried to say that by setting energy efficiency  standards for light bulbs, ‘‘Washington will effectively ban the sale of conventional incandescent light bulbs.’’ Nothing could be further  from the truth.  The lighting efficiency standards enacted by  Congress  in 2007 do not ban  incandescent  light bulbs, they simply make those bulbs 25  to  30  percent more  efficient  and  help  incentivize the development of even more efficient  lighting using alternative  technologies,  such as compact fluorescent lighting or light  emitting diodes.  Major light bulb manufacturers such as Philips, Osram Sylvania, and General Electric  have already developed more efficient incandescent bulbs that consumers can purchase in  the store today that meet the new standards.  Clearly, statements like the one made by the  Wall Street Journal are incorrect, because incandescent bulbs  to meet  the standard already exist developed  solely because  the  standard is in place.  The standard is also spurring manufacturers  to develop even more efficient lighting options  than just these new incandescent bulbs, creating R&D and high-tech manufacturing jobs in  the U.S. In Silicon Valley alone, Philips employs over 700 people and hired more  than  100 people at  its LED  facility  in San Jose,  California in 2010. We need to encourage this  kind of work, not roll back standards that led  to  the shipping of bulb manufacturing overseas.  The standard is good for the environment,  too—it will save the amount of electricity generated by more than 30 large power plants,  and prevent  the emission of global warming  pollution equivalent to the amount released by  14 million cars and light trucks each year. Critics may argue that by promoting the use of  compact fluorescent bulbs, the standard would  increase exposure to mercury, but on this they  are also wrong—the  reduction  in mercury  emissions from coal power plants that would  be achieved because less electricity is needed  for lighting is ten times greater than the mercury that could escape from a compact fluorescent bulb in a landfill.  Repealing  the  lighting efficiency standard  would cost the typical consumer around $100  per year  in additional energy costs.  In essence, Republicans want to institute an energy  tax on consumers in order to cling to some  antiquated vision of the past.  As a representative of Silicon Valley, I know  that we must look to the future and do everything that we can to promote the development  and  domestic manufacture  of  new  technologies that will help us use less energy and  grow our economy. That is why I support the  new  lighting efficiency standards and vehemently oppose H.R. 2147, the BULB Act.  ",2011

1322,41,2011-07-11,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," I will be brief.  The gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  HARRIS) and I are pretty close, but I  will respectfully oppose his amendment  for a couple of reasons.  One is that the program that is subject to his amendment is coordinating  programs with other countries. We’re  not, by definition, sending jobs overseas to other countries. The theory of  the program is to provide technical assistance  for activities to help prime  markets  for  clean  technologies  in  major emerging economies, and  the  theory of the program is also that it  can bring home lessons learned from  other experiences and share them at  the national, State and local levels.  I say I reluctantly oppose his amendment and that we are very close because I have great concerns over any  number of these types of programs at  the Department of Energy. I have expressed my displeasure  to  the Secretary, among others, that if we are  going to invest our taxpayers’ money—  our money—in  these  endeavors, we  ought to be very discreet as to how  those moneys are spent to develop markets in the United States of America  and, God bless, the rest of the world.  So I will in this instance take the Department of Energy at its word, and  that’s why I would respectfully oppose  the amendment. I would be happy to  stay in close communication with the  gentleman, and I would be happy to  stay in very close touch with the Department of Energy  relative  to  the  management of this program and, assuming the moneys are in the fiscal  year 2012 budget, to pursue this program to make sure that your point is  heard and that their expenditures are  not violative of what you want to do  today.  ",2011
1323,41,2011-07-11,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN., Will the gentleman yield?  ,2011

1325,41,2011-07-11,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," I have mixed  views as well.  Obviously, Israel is a strong ally, and  were it not for Kazakhstan, we perhaps  wouldn’t be able to do some things  militarily to support our troops that  are both  in Afghanistan and Iraq. I  think that it bears close watching, but  there  is a perception that somehow  we’re giving China, India, Brazil, and  other countries sort of an advantage. I  view this program as a two-way street.  It does provide a degree of access to  American companies.  So I reluctantly oppose your amendment, but I can assure you that both of  us  feel very  strongly  that  it bears  watching. It has borne some fruit, so  it’s not money wasted, and  it’s not  money given away to our competitors.  At least that’s my view of it.  ",2011
1326,41,2011-07-11,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," But I think, again,  it draws attention to the fact that we  should be very closely monitoring the  department as far as the expenditures  of these funds.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

1330,41,2011-07-11,Mr. HARRIS.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Let me just briefly address this so  that we can move on.  We only cut $6 million out of the $8  million. There is actually budget language further on that protects a cooperative agreement between  the U.S.  and Israeli Governments, so it does not  eliminate all the funding; it protects  that program, and there will be another amendment offered  later  that  will make that quite specific.  I understand that there is some possibility of actually getting a benefit for  partnering—and I thank the ranking  member  for  offering  assistance—but  honestly, I’m not sure what we’re going  to learn from Kazakhstan by sending  money over there to provide training  on industrial efficiency. I thought that  we were the powerhouse of the world in  industry. I thought we were the leader  of the world. It’s fine when we have a  lot of money, but the fact of the matter is we borrow 40 cents out of every  dollar, and the largest program expenditure outside of the joint program with  Israel is that expenditure in China.  Now, I want everyone to understand  there is still money available. It’s in  the Department of State budget. This  doesn’t eliminate these programs. This  just removes the Department of Energy’s contribution. I will remind the  body why the Department of Energy  was formed years and years ago. It was  to reduce our dependency on foreign  oil, and it has failed to do so. It has existed for decades, failing to do the mission for which it was established. In  my district, people in private industry  tell me, if they had a division or a department that failed to do its job for  decades, they wouldn’t be cutting it  back—they’d be eliminating it.  So, again, I thank the chairman and  I thank the ranking member, and I  urge the body to support the amendment.  ",2011
1331,41,2011-07-11,Mr. BROUN of Georgia.," In reclaiming  my time, I am going to support Dr.  HARRIS’ amendment.  As we face this huge budget deficit as  a Nation, we’ve got to look at every  source of cuts that we can possibly accomplish. It’s time not only to cut  spending, but we’ve got to start paying  back our debts, and we’re not doing  that here in this country. I think it is  absolutely critical. The American people, the people who are looking for jobs  today, want us to do the right thing.  Programs like this and many others  are killing our economy, and they’re  killing jobs in America.  So I’m going to support Dr. HARRIS’  amendment. I hope at least enough of  our colleagues here in the House will  understand  the  financial crisis  that  we’re in as a Nation and will support it  also.  I yield back the balance of my time.

1334,48,2011-07-11,Mr. GARRETT.," Mr. Chairman, I ask  my colleagues to rise with me in support  for my amendment, which will  save Americans over $500 million.  My  amendment  before  us  today  makes reasonable and targeted spending reductions  in order to do what?  Achieve significant savings that will  contribute  to  our  Nation’s  fiscal  health.  Mr. Chairman, we must really now  step forward and take bold steps to reduce spending. And I do commend my  colleague from the State of New Jersey  for the hard work that he has put in,  and I appreciate so many of the comments that he has already made on the  floor, pointing out to the other side  that in so many cases there is money  in these accounts, the money hasn’t  been spent, and they have taken a serious  look to try to rein  in spending  throughout the committee process. For  they realize that our Nation is on a  path to bankruptcy and we have maxed  out our Nation’s credit card.  So while the committee did an admirable job and made significant cuts in  the underlying bill, I stand here myself, and I and the Republican Study  Committee believe that we can go further than this. So this amendment is a  very reasonable attempt at showing  that this body is serious about cutting  spending.  Mr. Chairman, for too long the Federal Government’s  energy  programs  have been sold to the American public  as basically wise investments that will  yield  vast  new  technologies whose  costs would basically pale in comparison to the benefits later on. But when  you think about it, when you think  about the billions and billions of dollars that we have spent year after year,  our  energy  infrastructure  remains  largely the same in many respects, and  we are still here today dependent upon  foreign  sources  of  oil. And  energy  prices? Well, they just continue to spiral upward.  The other side talked wise energy  policy. Well, time and time again, Federal energy programs have  failed to  live up to their potential. These Federal programs have allowed the government to basically play venture capitalists, if you will, and they do so not  with their own money. Not at all. They  do it with taxpayer moneys. And despite the little return on their investment, they have little choice in making these investments. American taxpayers basically are commanded to increase this investment every year.  For example—I will just give out one  since we have been here for a long time  this evening—the American people are  being asked by their government to invest  literally millions  to  promote  something called ‘‘advanced solid-state  lighting.’’ What is that? It’s a technology that even its supporters can see  is far too expensive to compete in today’s marketplace. So does this sound  like something that an intelligent investor would do? I think not. But only  Members of Congress who are spending  other people’s money would do so.  Mr. Chairman, the United States is  home to the most vibrant marketplace  of ideas and investors. So the very best  way for government to encourage energy  innovation  and  revolutionary  technology is to do what? It is to use  that marketplace and get out of the  way and allow private capital to make  those investments. It is in the marketplace where private individuals will assess the risks and rewards, and they  will invest responsibly with their own  money on projects that will merit further development.  So to conclude, considering the precarious state of our economy and the  fiscal condition of this country, the  government can no  longer  invest  in  some of  these extremely  risky and  unproven projects without regard to  loss and expense. Government can no  longer play the role of that reckless investor. We must eliminate the waste  where it exists and encourage the Federal Government to spend the American public’s money in a wise and prudent manner.  For that reason I urge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to vote in  favor of this amendment and fiscal responsibility.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

1337,48,2011-07-11,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," First of all,  let me compliment my colleague and  good friend from New Jersey (Mr. GARRETT). And, of course, I’m reluctant because he’s done his homework and he’s  worked hard, and I believe, with him,  that we need to reduce Federal spending. We’ve been going over a financial  precipice.  But we on the Energy and Water  Committee made a commitment. Of  course, we were given a very low allocation, so we had to meet that. But we  have cut Energy and Water back to approximately the 2006 level after multiple hearings. We have put into the  bill more oversight. I believe we have  made  the  tough  choices. We’ve  reviewed all accounts. We’ve put at the  pinnacle, of course, our responsibility  for national security, national defense,  and the weapons program and the nuclear navy, the next class of Ohio ballistic submarines, and also made substantial  investments  in  the Army  Corps of Engineers.  I am reluctant to oppose this amendment, but  I  think we’ve made  the  tough choices. I urge Members to oppose the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

The gentleman mentioned advanced  solid-state  lighting. It  is my understanding  that Philips has  indicated  that a small investment in manufacturing  technology  to  improve  the  mechanisms as far as the construction  and manufacturing of these lightbulbs  would allow them to bring back jobs  that are currently outsourced overseas.  If we make that investment, and I hope  we do, I certainly would want to join  with other colleagues to see if, in fact,  Philips Electronics  is good to their  word. But at this point I would state  my objection.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

I  am joined by my colleagues Don YOUNG  of Alaska, CHARLESBASSof New Hampshire, and PAULTONKOof New York in  this bipartisan, commonsense amendment.  Now,  it’s  important because buildings use more energy than either transportation or industry. Fully 40 percent  of our energy is consumed by building  systems and in homes. My friend PAUL  TONKOcited the figure that 70 percent  of electricity  in America  is used  in  buildings.  At a time of both record energy costs  and record unemployment, we need to  protect Americans from crushing energy costs by improving the efficiency  of  existing  and  new  buildings  and  homes.

1356,69,2011-07-11,Mr. HATCH.," The article is written by  Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy  Center or TPC. TPC is a tax policy  think tank that is the product of two  center-left  think  tanks. The article  presents conclusions from a TPC distribution analysis of tax expenditures.  The analysis concludes that about  two-thirds of tax expenditures benefit  the top quintile of households in the  study. Viewers on C–SPAN may wonder  what a quintile is. It refers to one-fifth  of the given population. The TPC analysis is, therefore, measuring the top  one-fifth of the population.  According to that study, where does  that top one-fifth of the population  begin? It begins at $123,000 of household  income. It should be noted that household income is a bit broader than the  adjusted gross  income which  is  the  basis of the President’s definition. According to TPC, that top quintile earns  55 percent of income and shoulders a  huge amount of the Federal tax burden. They say it is 67 percent.  Now, perhaps not too surprisingly,  TPC finds that tax expenditures for the  top quintile approximate that top one-  fifth’s share of the tax burden. With  the exception of the refundable credit  tax expenditures, a taxpayer has to pay  income tax to benefit from the tax deduction credit or exclusion.  Those asserting  that  tax expenditures are mainly wealthy taxpayer benefits are principally relying on TPC’s  distribution  analysis.  If  confronted  with the TPC data, it seems to me they  have four choices. Their first choice  would be to revise downward the income basis of their definition of ‘‘rich.’’  They could say we really did not mean  families  at  $250,000  of  income; we  meant families of $123,000 of income.  That would be similar to the adjustment made for ObamaCare. Joint tax  distribution  tables  for  ObamaCare  showed that  for every  family below  $200,000 who received an exchange credit, four families paid higher taxes.

1382,76,2011-07-11,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Colorado’s great educators and community  leaders, David Getches, who  passed  away on Tuesday, July 5, 2011, at the  too-young age of 68.  This is more than a poignant moment for me. I had planned to come to  the floor to discuss David Getches’ career and character because he was stepping down after 8 very productive years  as the dean of the University of Colorado Law School.  We all have had this terrible experience in our lives when somebody whom  we love and respect suddenly finds they  have a cancer that is aggressive—beyond aggressive. Literally a month  ago, David was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In the 4 weeks since  that time, that cancer stole him from  us. But he was always upbeat. He was  always someone who we looked to for  enthusiasm and inspiration. I will be  inspired in my remarks today by what  he did. I will attempt not to dwell on  his loss.  As I said, Dean Getches served as  dean of the Colorado Law School for  the last 8 years. With him at the helm,  CU Law became one of the most forward-looking  institutions  of  legal  training in the country. I want to share  a few examples of his vision and leadership. I could not cover all of them if I  had a full hour. I want to share some of  them with the Senate and with his  friends and admirers in Colorado.  He steered this school through the  construction of the new LEED Certified Wolf Law Building, which put CU  and its law school at the cutting edge  of  environmental  sustainability  and  energy efficiency—two ideas that were  connected to the values that Getches  was committed to fostering throughout  his career. Getches previously served  as executive director of the Colorado  Department of Natural Resources and  as an adviser to the Interior Secretary  in the Clinton administration. He had  an extensive background in water, environmental,  and  public  lands  law.  Through his work, Getches impressed  upon all Coloradans the importance of  good stewardship of our State’s precious natural resources.

1383,97,2011-07-11,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor  the  life and memory of my  longtime  friend and staff member, Barbara Donnelly.  Mr. Speaker, the first person I hired for my  office when I was elected back in 1976 was  Barbara, which was one of the best decisions  I have made during my 35 years in Congress.  From  the moment  I  took  the oath of office,  Barbara served the people of my district with  a level of selflessness, loyalty and dedication  to helping others  that  is unrivaled. You will  never meet a more reliable or meticulous staffer, or a more caring person than Barbara Donnelly was. She was a perfectionist with a  heart.  Throughout her career, Barbara touched the  lives of thousands of residents in my district.  From helping constituents with Social Security  or veterans benefits, to assisting with immigration difficulties or the adoption of a child, Barbara did it all with compassion, discretion and  determination. With Barbara at the helm of my  constituent service program, I knew that she  would not rest until our office had done everything possible to help people in need.  Barbara was the definition of a public servant, giving everything  to her  job and never  asking for any credit. People like Barbara are  the unsung heroes of public service, who work  day and night to help others and almost never  see their names in the newspapers or on TV.  Barbara did not seek glory or recognition for  her work, she only sought to improve the lives  of others.  Mr. Speaker, there are few people like Barbara in this world. I feel blessed to have had  the honor of knowing her and calling her my  colleague. Over the years, I learned a lot from  Barbara’s example and it is my hope that she  will inspire others to lives of public service and  good works.  Mr. Speaker, Barbara was an irreplaceable  friend, staffer and human being. My condolences go out to her family, friends and all the  people who had the privilege of knowing her  and working with her. At this time of great sorrow,  I ask  the House of Representatives  to  join me  in honoring  the  life and memory of  Barbara Donnelly.  f  A BILL TO AMEND THE AFRICAN  GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT  HON. JIM McDERMOTT  OFWASHINGTON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 11, 2011  ",2011
1384,97,2011-07-11,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  introducing legislation that would update one  of our most important preference programs—  the  African Growth  and Opportunity  Act  (AGOA). This bill addresses  two  important  issues.  First,  it extends  the  ‘‘third-country  fabric’’  provision of AGOA for three years, which is  due  to expire  in September 2012. This will  align the third-country fabric provision with the  rest of  the AGOA program which expires  in  2015. Of course we are working on an  improvement and extension of  the AGOA program beyond 2015 right now.  The ‘‘third-country fabric’’ provision is one of  AGOA’s most  important elements.  It allows  apparel producers in lesser-developed sub-Saharan African countries  to use  third-country  fabric  in making apparel  that gets duty-free  treatment under AGOA (subject to a quantity  limit).  In 2010, textiles and apparel were one of  the  leading AGOA  import categories—$730  million in trade last year alone. Much of these  imports require fabric that is not commercially  available in sub-Saharan Africa. They depend,  in other words, on use of the third-country fabric benefits.  Textiles and apparel are key exports for a  number of AGOA countries including Lesotho,  Kenya, Mauritius, and Swaziland who last year  exported $692 million of goods to us, mostly  in apparel.  As U.S. Trade Representative Kirk recognized at last month’s ‘‘AGOA Forum’’ held in  Lusaka, Zambia, ‘‘AGOA textiles and apparel  have created new opportunities for investment  and  trade  that benefit businesses and consumers in both the United States and Africa.  This sector remains an  important  foundation  for Africa’s growing industrial base.’’  It is critical that the AGOA third-country fabric provision be extended now. It’s critical for  businesses here in the U.S. and for jobs.  Buyers and  retailers work on substantial  lead times and need stable terms and conditions  into  the  future.  If  there  is uncertainty  about whether AGOA apparel products will be  there next year, they will begin to turn away  from Africa. We cannot allow that to happen.  The second part of my bill  takes another  step in welcoming the new Republic of South  Sudan to the community of nations.  On July 9—the South Sudanese took their  future  into  their own hands and created  the  Republic of South Sudan.  The democratic process that resulted in the  birth of  this new country  is an astonishing  achievement—honoring  the  results of a  referendum in which more than 4 million people,  or 97 percent of registered voters, participated  with 98 percent voting for secession.  The fact that this comes at the end of the  longest and bloodiest  civil wars  in Africa  makes it all the more incredible.  President Obama  and Secretary Clinton  have already signaled U.S. support  for  the  new Republic of South Sudan.  We need to make sure we do all we can to  help South Sudan be successful. We should  act expeditiously, which  is why  I am  introducing this bill on the first legislative day after  the creation of this new nation.  I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support it.  f  ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES  APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2012  SPEECHOF  HON.

1387,3,2011-07-21,Mr. THOMPSON  of Pennsylvania.,"  Mr. Speaker, since 1947, every August,  the Little League Baseball World Series  is held  in South Williamsport,  Pennsylvania, within Pennsylvania’s  Fifth Congressional District. And each  year, Little League International recognizes Little League graduates who  have become outstanding citizens and  role models as adults for induction into  the Little League Museum Hall of Excellence.  Among previous  recipients of  this  honor include prominent figures such  as Vice President JOEBIDEN in 2009,  General Peter Pace in 2003, and former  New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in 2002.  This year’s ceremony will prove to be  extra special. For 2011, Little League  International plans  to  enshrine  the  first-ever  Little  League  graduate  known to have received our Nation’s  highest military award, the Medal of  Honor. That person is Army Private  First Class Ross Andrew McGinnis of  Knox, Pennsylvania. Ross McGinnis  played second base and outfield for 6  years  and  is  a  graduate  of Little  League in Knox, Pennsylvania, also in  the Fifth District.  In 2006, Army Private First Class  Ross McGinnis heroically gave his life  to save  four others  from a grenade  blast inside a Humvee during Operation  Iraqi  Freedom.  On  June  2,  2008,  McGinnis was awarded the Medal of  Honor posthumously for his heroic actions.  I will quote from President George  Bush: ‘‘In a selfless act of bravery, in  which he was mortally wounded, Private McGinnis covered the  live grenade, pinning it between his body and  the vehicle and absorbing most of the  explosion,’’ the official citation read,  which  was  awarded  by  President  George  Bush.  McGinnis’  mother,  Romayne, says baseball taught her son  teamwork  and  a  commitment  to  achieving common goals.  Today, because of McGinnis’ sacrifice  and commitment to others, four men  will live on to enjoy their families and  their futures. Congratulations to you,  Ross Andrew McGinnis. We thank you  for your service, and may you rest in  peace. Thank you  to Little League  International  for  recognizing  Mr.  McGinnis’ heroic achievements. To the  McGinnis family, we are proud of your  son, a true American hero.  f  b1020  PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES  ",2011
1388,3,2011-07-21,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for 5 minutes.  ,2011
1389,3,2011-07-21,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, almost  no one in Washington is talking about  jobs. For 2 months now, both Chambers  of the Congress have been locked down  in talking about the debt ceiling.  Meanwhile, if you look back at the  Bush years, America lost over 8 million  jobs while the largest recession since  the Great Depression, was precipitated  by the Bush Wall Street bailout. America has only gotten back about 2 million jobs. Yes, only 2 million; still jobs  are being created at about 120,000 per  month. That is far from where we need  to head to achieve economic recovery  for all.  But rather than this Congress engaging in intelligent dialogue on how to  create jobs, we keep going down these  side roads to nowhere. Meanwhile, unemployment  just went  up  another  10,000 jobs. 10,000 more workers filed for  unemployment.  Every Member in both Chambers will  be judged on not doing the work that  the people want us to do. Instead Congress must focus on how to use the  power of the Federal Government to  create jobs.  If you take a look at what the Republican majority in the House wants to  do, they want to cut unemployment  benefits. That’s not even understandable to any rational person.  They want to cut food. I invite any  one of them, come to my district. Come  and stand in the food lines. See how it  feels. Better yet, help us pack some of  the food bags, and then distribute them  and give them to veterans who are  coming home from the wars who don’t  have jobs. And then ask yourself what  are you really doing here. What are  you doing here? America needs jobs.  What about health benefits for people  who’ve fallen out of work, and don’t  have any more health benefits for their  family? Why should we cut there?  You know, there are some who like  to proudly proclaim they’re pro-life.  Pro-life doesn’t only involve the period  before a child is born. It involves the  entire  life of a person, of a human  being until natural death.  I think there are some philosophical  questions our Members ought to be  asking themselves about helping the  American people at this critical point  in our history.  Now, all of us want to produce balanced budgets. When you have full employment, you get balanced budgets  and you even can get extra funds. Full  employment means you can pay down  your  long-term debt. But you don’t  hear anything up here being talked  about jobs. If it were happening, we’d  have more job creation. But we have  less job creation. More people are going  on unemployment benefits. So the current conversation and discussions are  totally off base.  Let’s just look at one sector where  America and the Federal Government  could save a lot of money. America, as  a country, spends over $250 billion a  year on prescription drugs. And nearly  a third of that amount is paid for by  the Federal Government, which actually means our people paying their fair  share of taxes, when they work, to the  Federal Government and then the Federal Government meeting  its obligations to our citizenry for their security  and our Nation’s future. Now, some of  my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle are saying, cut Social Security,  cut Medicare. Hurt the American people. Hurt the people who have worked  for a  living. They don’t talk about  trimming  the  excess profits of  the  pharmaceutical  companies. So,  let’s  look at that pharmaceutical industry.  You know what? They’re not paying  their fair share into the Federal till.  Let’s just look at one bag of heparin  in a hospital for which Medicare ends  up paying over $600, and in total, millions and millions of dollars a year for  a product, a blood thinner that’s been  off patent for years. It’s made in China.  The  ingredients are made  in China.  They’re not even made here. Do you realize how much money a couple of companies are making off of selling just  that  one  product? My  Republican  friends aren’t trying to get fair prices  for the American people.  Celebrex, for treating arthritis, Medicare pays for an average patient $148 a  month. For Lipitor, for those trying to  lower cholesterol, $122 a month.  Now if you take a look at the profits  of Pfizer, Pfizer made $8.3 billion in  profits, and its CEO made $25 million  last year, just in what he’s willing to  admit. Johnson and Johnson made $13.3  billion  in  profits, while  their CEO  walked away with $29 million. Other  big drugmakers like Abbott Labs, $4.6  billion. These are with Bs—billions.  These aren’t with Ms—millions. These  aren’t millions; these are billions. And  Eli Lilly, $5 billion in profits our Federal Government is just forking over  billions all the time. Yes, the Federal  Government is the pharmaceutical industry’s biggest customer, and the industry surely knows it.  Why doesn’t the Federal Government  use its purchasing power to get better  bids on these drugs and have competitive bidding in order to purchase more  fairly-priced pharmaceuticals?

1391,10,2011-07-21,Mr. LANDRY.," Mr. Speaker, when I  ran for this office, I didn’t run to get a  job. I ran to create jobs.  I know that there is a new poll out  there, supposedly, that tells us that a  vast majority of Independents wants us  to compromise for a deal; but the question which all of the Members of this  House should poll their constituents  and the American people on is whether  or not they want this Congress to compromise their country for a deal.  Do we compromise our country for  the sake of simply getting a deal?  I also ran to uphold the Constitution.  I supported Cut, Cap, and Balance. It is  the compromise that I came here to  make. I compromised in agreeing to  raise the debt ceiling if we get real  cuts, if we cap our spending and if we  do what a vast majority of the States  in this country do—and that is to have  a balanced budget amendment.  What is so wrong with this balanced  budget amendment? It’s hard for me to  understand, Mr. Speaker.  Then along comes the Gang of Six.  Let’s see what the Gang of Six has.  Part one is that they cut $500 billion  in gimmicks compared to our real cuts.  How do they cut $500 billion? Part of it  is by changing the CPI formula and indexing for Social Security. Only in this  city does the law of mathematics not  work. You see, when I was in the second grade, I was taught that 2 + 2 is 4  and that 2 × 2 is 4. That hasn’t changed.  It’s still that today. But in this town,  when you  get  inside  this Beltway,  mathematics is different. You can get a  different outcome based upon a different formula.  Then the second part is they used the  reconciliation process in order to control our spending. Let’s see.

1393,17,2011-07-21,Ms. SPEIER.," I thank my good friend  from Ohio.  This  is getting old. The majority  knows it can’t kill an idea whose time  has come. So now they’re trying to  slow down the process, just like their  friends in the banking industry who  use tricks and traps to separate American  families  from their hard-earned  money. This bill is nothing more than  an attempt to turn the CFPB into the  Center For Profits and Big Business.  The Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau will provide  families a  level  playing field upon which to shop for  the  full range of  financial products.  Nothing is getting banned. Consumers  can still choose to make bad decisions  if they wish, but now they’ll have the  tools to be better informed through the  process. Instead of mountains of mortgage documents, they’ll get a simple-  to-read one-page document that they  can then use to answer crucial questions like, Is this something that I can  afford? Is this the best deal that I can  get?  The Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau is the most accountable regulatory body in the world. In fact, it has  a whole slew of regulators watching  and questioning everything it does. It  is required to undergo an annual GAO  report; have all enforcement actions  subject to appeal; and be regulated, in  turn, by every other agency on the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  Simply put, the CFPB helps families  hold on to the money they might otherwise give  to  the banks. And  the  banks hate that.  That is precisely why the majority  has  thrown  this  ridiculous  bill  together. Among other things, this legislation would require those regulating  predatory lenders to stop if their actions threatened the company’s ‘‘safety  and soundness.’’ In other words, their  profits.  We heard all about this issue when  we banned unreasonable penalties on  credit cards. At the time, the credit  card companies said this would absolutely crush their model. Well,  look  what’s happened. Are they still alive  and well? You bet they are. But the  truth  is this  legislation  isn’t really  about any of that. No, this is about the  only area where the majority has any  kind of legislative record: legislative  delay.  The anti-consumer bloc in this Congress is engaged in a legislative Ponzi  scheme. They’re helping Wall Street  suck a few more dollars out of American families before the inevitable happens and the CFPB stands up. Every  day politicians can stall the opening of  the bureau, well, that’s more profits.  Today, the CFPB is alive, and I want  every American to look at this opportunity to call this number. This is a  hotline available today for you to access if you’ve got problems with your  credit cards; but you had better act  now because the majority wants to  shut it down.  ",2011

House Republicans  have today officially  launched their  legislative effort to make sure these  protections will never have the chance  to do the job of protecting our consumers and  safeguarding  the  larger  economy. It is as if our friends across  the aisle are blind to the painful lessons of the Great Recession. It’s the  group that says let’s pretend the recession never happened. The Republican  strategy to defang, defuse, and delay  the consumer protection agency  ignores critical issues that contributed  both to the credit bubble and the financial meltdown.  Deceptive and misleading practices,  predatory lending, unsafe credit standards—these practices cost Americans  dearly.

1398,24,2011-07-21,Mr. SESSIONS.," I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  I’m going to have to stand up for  what we’re here for today, and that is,  Madam Speaker, that after this bill  was passed, it took almost one year for  the President to appoint the person  who would run the CFPB. The person  who runs the CFPB is required to have  Senate  confirmation. During Senate  confirmation—and it’s a process that  takes place for senior administrators  who run our government—during that  period of time this person who is nominated by the President would be expected to come  in on behalf of the  agency as a result of understanding  their mission statement and the things  that they do and would be expected to  come to the United States Senate and  to express their ideas. This is a brand  new agency. How it would be run, what  their mandate would be, how  they  would manage the assets and resources  not only of the agency but how they  viewed that mission statement vis-a-  vis the industry.  The President took a year to nominate this person. That person has not  even begun their hearings. I think, and  this  is what Republicans think, and  this is what our bill says today. I know  the gentleman, Mr. FRANK, said, Oh,  no, Republicans have  something  far  greater and bigger. It’s that they don’t  want this agency. Well, perhaps we  don’t want  the CFPB. Perhaps we  don’t. But that’s not what we’re here  today saying. We’re here saying that  until that head of that agency has a  chance—a brand new agency—has a  chance—after all, it’s taken a year to  come and speak forthrightly to elected  officials that are called Members of the  Senate to answer questions about how  they would run this agency, what the  philosophies should be, what the intent  of the agency is, how the interaction  between other agencies really should  be done, what they think of the law,  and what they see their job as being.  Those are important issues. And so Republicans are  saying we  should not  move forward on that until such time  as we are able to go through that process. So that’s really what Republicans  are here for.  I know there are a lot of people listening and watching and think there’s  something sinister about Republicans.  This is common sense. Republicans are  here talking about an agency that will  have broad and almost unlimited access to the marketplace. To overregulate, if you look at the possibilities.  And we’re trying to say before we kick  this thing off, let’s make sure we have  an idea of what the leader would say.  Otherwise, we should go to a group of  people who will run this, not just one.  to do  So  that’s what we’re here  today.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011

1400,24,2011-07-21,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," First,  Madam Speaker, I want to reassure the  gentleman  from Texas I don’t think  he’s sinister. I think he is opposed to  effective consumer protection. I think  he and the other Republicans, some of  them  believe—the  chairman  of  the  committee—that  the  regulators  are  there to serve the banks. I do believe  that they were opposed to it last year.  And I appreciate his honesty, his approach towards openness when he said  perhaps  they’re against  it. Perhaps  they’re against it. They understood it  would be a bad idea to go all out to try  to weaken it.  But let me respond to his point about  confirmation.  It’s  bogus,  Madam  Speaker. He said we’re just trying to  hold this up until there’s a confirmation. But 44 Republican senators have  announced that they will not allow any  confirmation to go forward—they will  filibuster it, and they have more than  the 40 they need to do that—until the  agency  is weakened. They have said  they will not allow it to go forward  until we allow the bank regulators,  who Republicans think are there to  serve the banks, can overrule this. And  they weren’t  just saying that about  Elizabeth Warren. Forty-four Republican senators contradicted the gentleman from Texas. He talked about  this wonderful confirmation process. It  can’t happen because 44 Republicans  have said until we give in and weaken  the agency, they won’t confirm anybody.  ",2011
1401,24,2011-07-21,Mr. SESSIONS.," Madam Speaker, I  appreciate the gentleman’s perspective  of looking into my brain and knowing  what I think or talking about how 44  senators override what I’m saying. I  would tend to offer the argument that  as we near now the August recess, they  had  every  understanding  that  the  President, without this person going  through hearings, having to come to  Congress, to the Senate, to talk about  and go through these hearings, that the  President would just offer a recess appointment. In other words, bypassing  exactly  what  we’re  talking  about  should happen, and that is where this  brand-new nominated person, after a  year, waiting until just a few weeks before the August recess.  Madam Speaker, what we’re saying is  we’re not going to allow, in the Senate,  the  44 Senators  saying  they’re not  going to allow a recess appointment  where this person is appointed, nominated, and just gets it done because the  Senate  is gone. We’re not going to  allow him to skip out of coming and  having to be thoughtful and talking  about what he’s going to do as the head  of this CFPB.  So to say that 44 Senators really are  trying to do the wrong thing or that  I’m here trying to suggest something  different is not true. We believe that  this new agency must have the person  who’s going to head it to come to Congress, be forthright and open to hearing questions and responding back. I  think that’s open, honest, transparent,  and legitimate. And if the President  waited a year, he should expect that we  would probably have an opinion that  we would not want a recess appointment.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011

1403,24,2011-07-21,Mr. ANDREWS.," I thank my friend  from New York for yielding.  Tomorrow will be yet another Friday  without  a  paycheck  for  15 million  Americans, and this is the 198th day of  the Republican majority. It is the 198th  day that they’ve brought no legislation  to the floor to address the jobs crisis  and create jobs for the American people. Now most  of  those  198  days,  they’ve ignored the problem.  Today’s bill is a curious approach to  the problem that  I think makes  it  worse. Americans painfully remember  what happened in the fall of 2008 when  the big banks started to go under and  slip under. People’s  401(k) accounts  melted,  people’s  home  equity  disappeared, and to this day most Americans’ homes aren’t worth nearly what  they were worth in the fall of 2008.  Foreclosures went up, jobs went down,  and people’s hopes went out the window.  The predicate of today’s bill is the  reason  that  all  happened  is  there  weren’t  enough  regulators watching  the banks. Or, excuse me, the predicate  of today’s bill is that there were too  many regulators watching the banks. I  had it backward because it’s so obvious.  You  understand  that  today’s  bill  starts from the presumption that the  problem here is that there were too  many people watching what the banks  did to make sure they did the right  thing by the country. I think exactly  the opposite was true.  I think the  fact that these banks  could take money insured by the taxpayers under the FDIC and gamble it  on credit default swaps was wrong; I  think the fact that they could sell junk  bonds masquerading as valid mortgages  was wrong; I think the fact that they  charged extortionist credit card interest rates was wrong; I think the fact  that they papered over loans for people  who never should have gotten  loans  was wrong. And the problem was not  that their hands were too tied; the  problem was that they were being ignored by the regulators.  ",2011

1411,31,2011-07-21,Mrs. CAPITO.," I yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, a year ago, the President signed into law the most sweeping  financial regulatory reform package in  nearly a generation. The centerpiece of  the Dodd-Frank Act was the creation  of the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau. While there was nearly unanimous agreement  that  improvements  were needed in the regulatory structure  for  financial  services and consumer credit, we as Republicans did  not agree that the best answer to the  problems was creating an entirely new  bureaucracy.  No legislation is perfect, and Dodd-  Frank is a law that needs to be improved and refined.

1414,38,2011-07-21,Mr. GARRETT.," So he says on the one  hand that the risk retention is most  important; then he turns around and  says that any  loans with 4 percent  down payment should be exempt from  risk retention. I don’t know very many  loans that are at that level. So I find it  surprising that he is attempting to exempt everyone from what he claims is  the most important portion of his bill  instead of accusing everyone else of attempting to destroy this job-destroying  bill.  Mr. Chairman, I would ask that the  gentleman  from Massachusetts think  before he speaks on the legislation and  then come out in support of the same  legislation that he once supported in  the past.  ",2011
1415,38,2011-07-21,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," How  much time  is remaining, Mr. Chairman?  ",2011
1416,38,2011-07-21,The Acting CHAIR., The gentlewoman  from West Virginia has 4 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 53⁄4minutes remaining.  ,2011
1417,38,2011-07-21,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," First,  the gentleman from New Jersey more  consistently misstates things that  I  said. I suppose it’s kind of flattering  that he hangs on my every word. I just  wish he didn’t hang askew on my every  word. He said I should be supporting  this legislation. In fact, the gentleman  from Alabama said it. Once again, listen to what they say on the other side.  This has three pieces. It has a single  member versus a commission. More importantly, it increases the ability of  the other bank regulators who have an  historic  terrible  record of consumer  protection and who the chairman of  the committee, Mr. BACHUS, says are  there to serve the banks. It would put  them in a better position to cancel the  work of the CFPB. The gentleman from  New Jersey said I’ve supported this.  I’ve never supported anything remotely  like that. The gentleman  from New  Jersey knows that. I have no idea why  he would do that, except for this. And  yes, I will impute some motive.  Of the three parts of the bill, the  only one that they think won’t be very  unpopular is the one about a single director versus a commission. But, again,  the gentleman said, oh,  I misstated  that or that I was in favor of something  last year. No, I was never  in  favor of those parts of the bill.  By the way, as to the risk retention,  I did say you could get the 4 percent if  you also had a very good debt-to-income ratio and loan-to-value ratio.  So the pattern of misstatements of  what I said, it’s flattering that the gentleman is so interested in what I say. I  did not ever support putting the bank  regulators back in charge. In fact, I  will say this about the gentleman from  New Jersey. He’s more clear about  what he really believes.  Again, I hope the gentlewoman from  West Virginia, when she closes, will  tell us. She voted against this  last  year. She now says, oh, we’re not trying to undo it. Well, has she switched  her position?  The gentleman from New Jersey was  very clear. He doesn’t really like this,  and he voted against it and he would  abolish the whole thing. That’s what  we are saying, that people who voted  against it last year. He says we made it  partisan. No. When the vote came up  on this, they all voted against it. I wish  that wasn’t the case, but they had  voted against  it because they didn’t  want an independent consumer agency.  The chairman of the committee said it  again today on television: We don’t  worry about the FDIC or the Federal  Reserve. We worry about an agency  whose sole mission is to protect the  consumer without worrying about how  the banks work.  And then we had the performance by  the gentleman from Wisconsin, again,  talking only about one part of it and  claiming, oddly it seemed to me, that  this somehow hurts the small banks  versus the bigger banks. In fact, the  small banks are given preference with  regard to who gets examined.  And in terms of the ability to overturn rules, no, it’s not simply—and this  is one of the things some people may  misunderstand. Things that threaten  the system might be the action of one  particular entity like AIG, but they  could also be a pattern like subprime  loans,  particularly  subprime  loans  issued by nonbanks. This bill regulates,  for the first time, those nonbanks.  So let’s go back over this. Ms. Warren came up with this. And I do want  to address the single member versus  commissioners.  The one issue they have found, it was  originally proposed by Ms. Warren, and  I introduced the administration’s bill  to make it a commission. We had hearings. We had conversations. Every single  consumer  group  that we  dealt  with—and  the gentleman  from Wisconsin mentioned all his supporters.  There wasn’t a single consumer group  there. The AARP just came out against  their bill, as have all of the consumer  groups—the Consumer Federation, et  cetera. They persuaded me that a single member would be better than a  commission.  I  acknowledge we had  hearings. I listened to people who were  for it.  So here’s the debate. We have everybody who voted against establishing  this in the first place, who are against  it in principle, who think we should  leave it to the bank regulators, they  want a commission. We have everybody  who supports the entity as an independent consumer protector, therefore,  a single member. I listened. I was persuaded. So, yes,  I will acknowledge  having changed my position based on  the evidence.  I will repudiate, once again, the gentleman’s inaccurate suggestion that I  was for the other parts of this. No, I  was not. I think putting the majority  of the bank regulators able to overrule  virtually anything doesn’t work.  And the proof of that? The Republicans offered their own version last  year, the gentlewoman  from  Illinois  (Mrs. BIGGERT). It created a 14-member  council, Secretary of  the Treasury,  Secretary of Defense, a bunch of others, and they were empowered to set up  a hotline. If they got things from the  hotline or the Web site that were complaints about the banks, what did they  do with them? They sent them to the  very  financial  regulators who have  failed to do things in the past.  b1630  That’s where we are. That’s what  they preferred. They opposed then, and  I believe continue to oppose, an independent regulator whose primary role  is the consumer.

1427,52,2011-07-21,Ms. CHU.," Mr. Chairman, my amendment would give additional responsibility to the Commissioner who is already in charge of oversight of the Bureau’s activities pertaining to the protection of older consumers, minorities,  youth, and veterans. It would require  research on how language barriers can  lead to unfair and abusive lending practices, and a report to the full Commission on ways  to protect consumers  from potentially unfair and deceptive  practices.  Take the case of Ms. Huang, who  went to a car dealership and negotiated  a car sale with a salesperson in Chinese. But then when she went to sign  the contract, it was totally in English,  and she didn’t understand it. When she  got it translated later, she discovered  that she bought a different car with an  extremely high interest rate. She went  back to the car dealership for redress,  but they refused. She was so upset that  all she could think of to do was go back  to the dealership and wrap herself in a  white sheet and hold a sign that said  ‘‘Cheaters’’ and walk up and down in  front of the dealership in protest. Well,  that gained attention. It turned out  that many other immigrants had been  cheated in this manner as well, so I  sponsored a bill in the California State  Assembly to address these deceptive  practices. But that is just one State  and one small fix.  Now I know that the Consumer Financial Protection Safety and Soundness Act does not include oversight of  automobile  loans,  but Ms. Huang’s  story highlights how persons with language barriers can be victims of deceptive practices. We need someone on a  national level looking out for people  like Ms. Huang and staying on top of  ways people are being duped because of  language barriers. And  that  is  just  what my amendment will do.  I urge support of my amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011

1430,52,2011-07-21,Mrs. CAPITO.," I would like to thank  the gentlewoman for her amendment.  I would like to also highlight, in the  Dodd-Frank bill, and I’m sure she is  well aware of some of the provisions  that are already being made through  the CFPB  for multilingual outreach  and understanding.  During a conference call with a large  number  of  bipartisan  congressional  staff, the senior officials at the CFPB  indicated that the Bureau would have  the capacity to translate into 180 languages. That is a very broad reach, I  think. And there are other foreign language disclosures outreach by the Secretary of the Treasury to help persons  facing language barriers and other aspects around the same issue that the  gentlelady is speaking about.  I am delighted that she wants to  amend the Commission because, as we  know, and I have spoken more than a  few times on this in just the last several hours, about my ardent support for  the Commission. There is one Commissioner who is charged with overseeing  some special segments of our population, and certainly ones who have  language barriers would be included in  this.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

1432,52,2011-07-21,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," I appreciate the gentlelady from West Virginia making a very important point,  seriously,  talking  about  the multilingual aspects, because an important  bipartisan  part  of  our  committee’s  work over the years, and we’ve had  some differences, but the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Mrs. BIGGERT), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. HINOJOSA) and  a number of others have stressed an  important part of this Agency’s mission is financial literacy.  We all agree that if people were better educated, they could defend themselves better. This is an ongoing, joint  effort on our committee. And obviously, if you’re trying to do financial  literacy, it has to be in a language that  the people understand. So I appreciate  the gentlelady highlighting that, and it  does help us do it.  I would note, and I think the gentlewoman from California is quite correct  in wanting to do this, but you don’t  need a commission to do it. If there  wasn’t a commission, we could do it  with various agency heads. For example, there has been some concern about  making sure that veterans are taken  care of and people in the military. One  of the things that Elizabeth Warren  did, and she did a number of extraordinary things, and I don’t know if people are aware of the head of the military Bureau that protects members in  the services, a very experienced woman  from  the  military  named  Holly  Petraeus, the wife of General Petraeus.  That’s an example of how you can do  these things.  So  the principle  that  the gentlewoman from California advocates is a  very good one, and I’m sure we’ll find a  way to accommodate it. I thank her.  ",2011
1433,52,2011-07-21,Ms. CHU.," Mr. Chairman, I would like  to say that this does not create any  overly burdensome responsibility. Instead, it supports the goal of the legislation. It protects those persons who  might be the victims of such unfair and  deceptive practices.  What this does is clarify that this  specially  designated  Commissioner  would take into account how language  barriers might be  impacted by such  abusive practices, and it makes sure  that that is done.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

1448,80,2011-07-21,Mr. CRENSHAW.," Mr. Chairman,  claim time in opposition.  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  from  Florida is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2011
1449,80,2011-07-21,Mr. CRENSHAW.," I thank the gentleman for bringing all of these issues  to our attention; but I want to direct  him to United States Code, title 44,  which basically directs  the Government Printing Office to do the things  that they do. So, if the gentleman is  concerned, I’d suggest the first thing  he do is read title 44 and find out what  is required by Congress. If we change  that, we might be able to change some  of the printing that goes on.  The Government Printing Office only  produces what it is ordered to produce  I  by Congress. I think we all know that  we’ve already cut their budget by 16  percent, and I don’t know what’s magic  about the last 4.3 percent. I think our  subcommittee,  through  a  series  of  hearings and informal hearings, looked  at the facts. We set some priorities,  and we said we’re going to reduce the  funding by 16 percent. We detail in our  report some of the things that are of  interest to us. We actually are going to  take a look at privatizing the entire  Government Printing Office, but once  again, so much of that is driven by this  title 44.  I  b2050  Already GPO has announced a buyout  program. They’re going to reduce their  workforce by 15 percent through this  buyout program. That’s 330 positions.  And any  further significant changes  are going to require a change in this  printing law.  So while  I  think  the  gentleman  makes some good points, I simply want  to say that we looked at the facts. We  reduced the spending by 16 percent. We  think that’s appropriate.  So I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this  amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011
1450,80,2011-07-21,Mr. STUTZMAN.," Mr. Chairman,  yield myself 1 minute.  I do appreciate the points about the  responsibilities of the GPO and that  they are required by law to print certain documents, but let me give you  several examples. And again, let’s remind ourselves that all of these—this  is actually an environmentally friendly  bill. This is an amendment that would  actually  reduce  the  cost  and  the  amount of paper that we print many of  these words on.  These are all available to any American on the Internet, and especially to  each one of us as individuals of Congress, Members of Congress, and to our  staff. But we have the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD, the Congressional Directory,  the Senate and the House Journals,  memorial addresses of Members, nominations, U.S. Code and Supplements,  laws and treaties, envelopes provided  to Members of Congress for the mailing  of documents, House and Senate business and committee calendars, bills,  resolutions  and  amendments,  committee reports and prints, committee  hearings. All of these are obviously  very important documents, but I believe in the day and age that we live in,  all of these can be done electronically  and digitally and would actually save  dollars for the American taxpayer.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011
1451,80,2011-07-21,Mr. CRENSHAW.," Mr. Chairman,  I  would like to yield 1 minute to the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. HONDAfrom California.  ",2011
1452,80,2011-07-21,Mr. HONDA.," I thank the chairman  for yielding.  My  daddy used  to  say  that you  should really be careful of zealots because they come in hacking and hewing. I think there are a couple of things  that the chairman has pointed out that  require some study and thought.  The gentleman who’s wanting to do  the cutting, he indicated there was a  book that was talking about deficits,  but that book has been paid by CBO, so  it is not a cost of GPO.  And then in terms of security, GPO  has the security, but they’re required  to issue passports, and with passports  you have to have security there.  So I think a more studied approach  would probably be in place. Cuts for  cuts’ sake, I think, is, in the words of  my  father,  foolhardy.  I would  recommend that we slow down and make  haste with all deliberate speed, and I  agree with my chairman here.  ",2011
1453,80,2011-07-21,Mr. STUTZMAN.,"  I yield myself  1  minute, the remaining balance of my  time, Mr. Chairman.  I understand the gentleman’s point  about CBO spending their dollars on  this publication, but we see these publications around Capitol Hill everywhere. You go to any congressional office and you will see documents and  publications that people never use.  Again, let’s advance ourselves into  the day and age that we live in and  using these documents  in electronic  format.  But also my understanding is that  the 16 percent reduction is returning  ourselves to the 2009 levels, if my understanding is correct. I believe that  we need to reduce ourselves even further than that.  Again, this is a very simple amendment.  I  think  the American people  would agree with this and that we are  saving  every dollar and  looking at  every opportunity to save tax dollars.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011
1454,80,2011-07-21,Mr. CRENSHAW.," I yield myself such  time as I might consume and simply to  say that the subcommittee looked at  this. We have concerns. We reduced  spending by 16 percent. If you want to  have any more significant savings, you  are going to have to change the printing laws that are there in chapter 54.  So I would simply say I think we’ve  done a good job of what we’re trying to  do. We are looking for ways. And remember, they print what they’re asked  to print. When GAO asks them to print  something, they pay for it. A lot of  people say that we ought to just privatize  the whole  thing,  and  that’s  something we’re thinking about doing.  But I think we’ve cut down sufficiently. I think they can still do their  job. They don’t need any further cuts.  I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. STUTZMAN).  The question was  taken; and  the  Chair announced  that  the ayes appeared to have it.  ",2011

If I hit 10 minutes, I might ask unanimous consent  for an additional  5, and  seeing  the  smile on the Presiding Officer’s face,  perhaps he will be conducive to that request. I also wish to associate my remarks with the distinguished Senator  from Texas.  Every  generation  confronts  challenges. The greatest generation declared victory over fascism and imperialism. The  next  generation  faced  down  an  enormous  competition  between the United States and its way of  life based on free markets, private ownership,  and  free  expression  on  one  hand; and the Soviet Union and its way  of life based on central planning, collectivization and police state control  on the other. Again, victory belonged  to America and the free world.  A new generation  in America has  now come of age since the Soviet system collapsed. It is a generation that  too often,  in my opinion, takes  for  granted the hardship and sacrifice of  our forebears. It is this generation that  must confront the crippling $14.3 trillion debt—and climbing. We have met  the enemy and he ‘‘is’’ us. The enemy  today is our unsustainable debt, as has  been  pointed  out  by  speaker  after  speaker on both sides of the aisle.  I am privileged to represent the people of Kansas and the people of Kansas  are rightfully angry over the endless  posturing and all the rhetoric and all  the  fingerpointing regarding yet another  increase  in the national debt.  That is right, another increase in the  debt limit. Here we are again trying to  reach agreement. I wish the President  and the House leadership well in their  current talks. I wish the Senate was  engaged. We certainly don’t need to  kick the can down the road any farther.  We are faced with one issue; that is,  to rein in spending.

1462,122,2011-07-21,Mr. NELSON  of Florida.," Madam  President,  I know that the Senator  from Massachusetts has time. I  just  want to take this time while he is coming into the Chamber to say that you  can almost hear  in  the background  very foreboding music as we are counting down the days. Here we are in a situation in which we cannot get a certain group of people over in the House  of Representatives to be willing to sit  down, and, as the Good Book says, to  come and let us reason together.  If we are going to govern this country, we have to come and reason together, people of goodwill who will respect each other’s point of view, to  hammer out a final agreement in order  to start bringing this country into balance. It is sad that it is taking this  long and this much of a difficult torturous process.  FLORIDA’SHISTORY  On a much happier note, at a subsequent time I want to share with the  Senate the wonderful heritage that we  have  in this country, not  from the  English but from the Spanish. We are  about to celebrate 500 years of the discovery of what is now America, the  United States,  from the Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon who first came to  the shores of my State. Then soon  thereafter we will celebrate the 450th  anniversary of the oldest continuous  settlement, a  settlement  that  is  42  years before the English came and settled Jamestown.  Those celebrations are going to be  not just for Florida and not just for St.  Augustine but for all of Florida and all  of the country. We have a commission  that has been appointed by the Secretary of the Interior. We have just  kicked off that commission. I will be  sharing with the Senate a lot about  this  historical  restoration  in  the  public’s mind of all of those Spanish  explorers who helped  establish  this  country, first with Ponce de Leon in  1513, and he came back in 1539.  By the way, the Puerto Rican community is quite energized and excited  about  this because Ponce de Leon,  when he came and found at the Feast  of Flowers, Pascua Florida—and thus  he named La Florida—he was the Governor of Puerto Rico.  So they are quite excited, as they  should be, and they will be part of this  celebration.  After him came a Spanish explorer  named de Ayllon, who sailed up the  coast.  Later, in 1527, came Spanish explorer  Narvaez, who landed somewhere in the  Tampa region and went up into the  panhandle of Florida.  After him came the Spanish explorer  Hernando de Soto in the late 1530s. He  ended up landing also in the Tampa  Bay region when, all over Florida, they  celebrated the first Christmas because  he had Spanish priests with him and  was in what is today Tallahassee by  Christmas Day. They celebrated the  first Christian Christmas by Europeans  in this new world of what is now the  United States. That was the late 1530s.  Then he ended up traveling all over the  United States, what is now the Southeastern United States.  Then along came de Luna thinking  he would have the first permanent settlement in 1559 in Pensacola, and in  1561, along came a hurricane, and it  wiped them out. We had the King and  Queen of Spain in Pensacola on that  anniversary back in 2009.  Then later came the French thinking  they were going to set up the first permanent settlement at Fort Carline at  the mouth of what is today the St.  John’s River at Jacksonville in 1564.  But when they heard that the Spanish  explorer Menendez had come 30 miles  to the south to set up this permanent  settlement  at  St. Augustine,  they  sailed to wipe out the Spanish colony  and instead got hit by a hurricane and  were shipwrecked and thus dispatched  by  the Spanish  explorer Menendez.  From there, St. Augustine continued  all the way to the present day. You  ought to see that restored city. It is a  sight to behold, and it is not only the  history of St. Augustine, the history of  Florida, it is the history of this United  States.  I will share a lot more about our  Spanish history, our roots in this country. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts  for his kind  indulgence  so  that I might share this with the Senate.  I yield the floor.  ",2011

1464,122,2011-07-21,Mr. KERRY.," Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from Florida. I  am delighted to accommodate him and  join with all Floridians in a good celebration of a great part of our history.  Madam President, obviously everybody in America is well aware that the  date of August 2 is fast coming at us.

1465,129,2011-07-21,Mr. LEAHY.," Madam President, on  Monday I, again, set forth the history  of our efforts to extend the term of  Robert Mueller as the FBI Director in  response to the President’s request. I  am glad that the Senate is now being  permitted to proceed to pass the bill.  The holds have finally been lifted.  I worked with Senator GRASSLEY to  respond to the President’s May 12 request, and the Judiciary Committee reported a bill to do that more than one  month ago. I am pleased that a bill finally passed the Senate today. I hope  the House will take up and pass the bill  so that it can be signed by the President, and the Senate can confirm Director Mueller’s renomination prior to  August 3, 2011.  This important legislation, S. 1103,  would  fulfill the President’s request  that Congress create a one-time exception to the statutory 10-year term of  the FBI Director, in order to extend  the term of the incumbent FBI Director for 2 additional years. Given the  continuing threat to our Nation, especially with the 10th anniversary of the  September 11, 2001, attacks approaching, and the need to provide continuity  and stability on the President’s national security team, it is important  that we respond to the President’s request and enact this necessary legislation swiftly. The incumbent FBI Director’s term otherwise expires on August  3, 2011.  ",2011
1466,129,2011-07-21,Mr. PAUL.," Madam President, I am  voting no on S. 1103, a bill to create a  second 2 year term for the FBI Director. I am opposed to changing the term  limits  on  this  important  position,  which serve as a safeguard and check  against the significant power of the position. I am not opposed to Director  Mueller and will not oppose his renomination, but I do oppose the idea that  term limits should be changed when it  is convenient. I thank him and the Bureau for their cooperation and answers  to my questions over  the  last  few  weeks.  ",2011
1467,129,2011-07-21,Mr. REID.," I want to extend my appreciation  to  Senators  and  for  together  this  matter done.  He has done a wonderful job for 10  years, and the country believes they  need him for 2 more years, and he has  agreed to take that, and I appreciate  that very much.  ",2011

1473,136,2011-07-21,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President, I come  down here  frustrated and hopeful.  I  want to see the glass half full even  though we have been through a frustrating number of days and months  dealing with our debt crisis, and here  we are careening toward another crisis.  Congress went through this earlier in  the year. It seems as though the only  way we ultimately get things done is  to take it right up to the edge and then  come through with an agreement.  I  don’t think it is fair to the American  people. It clearly isn’t a formula for  providing certainty in our economy for  those who are running businesses and  for households that are making tough  decisions.  If there is one word that characterizes where we have been this entire  year, it is ‘‘uncertainty’’—uncertainty  about what the future is going to look  like. Are we going to default or not? Do  we have enough money to pay the bills  or not? What are the consequences of a  potential default? When we had the  continuing resolutions to provide funding for the rest of the year, we went  from one extension to another extension  to  another. Everything  is  in  limbo. How can you run an economy,  how can a business man or woman  The  to  make a decision  if they don’t know  what is coming down the line in terms  of taxes, in terms of regulations, in  terms  of  the  economic  climate,  in  terms of whether people will be buying,  selling, or just sitting on their money?  Into the third year of a slowdown and  recession, the economy is growing but  not growing at a rate that is putting  people back to work. We all want to  get the economy moving again, and inserting certainty into the process will  certainly be a positive step forward.  I think there is virtually unanimous  consent  that  this  government  has  grown too big, it spends too much, it  doesn’t have the revenues to pay for  what it does, and there needs to be real  reform taking place soon.  We are 12 days away from August 2,  the date the Treasury Department has  indicated we run out of money and  don’t have enough to pay our bills. Obligations that have been committed to  and promised can’t be paid because we  won’t have the funds to do so on August 2.  We have known this day was coming  for a long time. We were originally told  we would run out of money in March,  and then for some reason it was moved  to May and then to August. I don’t  know how  they are moving money  around at the Treasury to extend this  particular date, but it appears we are  now at the end of the road, we are at  the wall, and decisions have  to be  made.  Are we going to take the necessary  steps, make the tough decisions, and do  what we need to do to control our  spending, to put in place mechanisms  that will ensure we don’t continue to  do what has been done over the past  several years, and put policies in place  that will stimulate our economy and  get people back to work? After all, it is  really all about jobs. It is all about an  economy that is providing opportunities for young people coming out of college and high school, opportunities for  people to buy homes and raise their  families and save money and send their  kids to school, to keep a good-paying  job, to be able to pay the mortgage and  all the bills that come to the household  every month. That is really what it is  all about. Unless we address  these  issues before us here fiscally, we are  not going to get to the point where  people have hope for the future.  I said I am frustrated, and I guess I  just expressed some of that frustration,  but I am also hopeful. I am hopeful because in times of crisis, solutions can  be found. We wish we could do it in a  more systematic way. We wish we had  done it in the past several months, but  we didn’t, so here we are. And now I  think the focus is clearly on getting to  a solution.  We are debating a plan called cut,  cap, and balance—cut because we are  spending more money than we can afford to spend; cap because we want to  put procedures in place not to spend  more than we can afford in years to  come; and balance, a balanced budget  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:45 Jul 22, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00047 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G21JY6.069 S21JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2011

1475,143,2011-07-21,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Mr. President, I  wish to say a few words about the debt  ceiling that is rapidly approaching. But  on this particular day, I cannot come  to the floor and speak about anything  without  just making one,  I guess  I  would say, note of personal privilege;  that is, that today is a particularly sad  day in my home State of Rhode Island  because one of the great Rhode Islanders has passed away.  Former Gov. Bruce Sundlun, whom I  worked for for many years and formed  a very devoted affection for has died  peacefully at home with his  family  after one of the most accomplished and  eventful lives in Rhode Island history.  I know my  senior Senator, JACK  REED, and I will be back on the floor at  a  later  time  to  give Gov. Bruce  Sundlun his proper due and recognition. But for all he has meant to me,  for all he has meant to our State of  Rhode Island, for all he has meant to  the people whose lives have been made  so much better or who have been protected from very bad outcomes by his  courage and by his determination, I  simply could not overlook that at this  point. So more will follow on my dear  friend, Bruce Sundlun.  So to the matter at hand. Less than  2 weeks from now, our Nation is going  to hit its statutory borrowing limit,  and it may begin, for the first time in  its history, defaulting on  its obligations.  Unless we act very soon, the Treasury of the United States of America,  long the issuer of the safest and the  most  conservative  securities  in  the  world, will simply run out of money.  Social Security checks, as the President has already said, would be at risk.  Millions of American  families would  suddenly lose their household income.  The Treasury would have to suddenly  stop paying more than 4 out of every 10  Federal dollars, choking off all the economic  activity  supported  by  those  funds.  Private  sector projects across  the  country that depend on Federal dollars  or Federal permits or Federal regulatory approval, all would grind to a  halt—a catastrophic triple whammy on  our economic activity.  In addition, an increase in interest  rates would likely freeze investments  and cause  the  financial markets  to  plummet. So reaching the decent limit  will not just put us back into recession, it would risk economic calamity.  With the stakes so high and with time  so short,  it  is unfortunate that the  House Republicans who created this  completely  unnecessary  crisis  have  sent us this so-called cut, cap, and balance bill.  This bill, which cuts no tax  loopholes, not one, and puts no cap on corporations offshoring jobs or earnings  and dodging U.S. taxes, would do one  thing:  It would kill Medicare. Consistent with the Republican 2012 budget, this bill puts the costs of deficit reduction right down on those who can  least afford it: senior citizens, the disabled, and our children.  The cut, cap, and kill Medicare plan  the House Republicans have proposed  would begin with steep cuts to Federal  programs in 2011, while we are still in  this  recession,  slashing  domestic  spending  by  over  $111  billion,  and  eliminating 700,000 jobs from our economy when we need them the most.  It would also require immediate cuts  to social safety net programs likely reducing—or eliminating even—student  loans, Pell grants, school lunches, Medicaid, and  food stamps, some of the  most important programs to families  who are struggling to get back on their  feet during this prolonged period of  high unemployment. This is simply unacceptable.  The second part of the cut, cap, and  kill Medicare bill would limit Federal  spending beyond 2012 to levels significantly lower than during the Reagan  Presidency. In fact, our Nation has not  seen spending at those low levels since  1966. Mr. President, 1966 was a time  when only 9.2 percent of the population  was retired and drawing benefits, compared with 12.9 percent today.  So the effects of those spending levels would be even harsher. The cap on  Medicare and Social Security makes no  adjustment for the $2.5 trillion of Social Security reserves that Americans  have paid into that system, that the  government then went and borrowed. It  makes no adjustment for that being  their money or  for the aging population that we are experiencing.  So with  a  fixed  cap,  and  baby  boomers retiring in greater numbers,  the Republican plan forces devastating  cuts to Social Security and Medicare  benefits. There is simply no other way.  It would address our deficit  in  the  worst way possible, by taking an axe to  the retirement programs on which tens  of millions of retired Americans rely  and which most every working person  in America looks forward to.  For  ordinary Americans,  this  approach  is wrong. Frankly,  it  is unthinkable, although it is the goal of a  few determined  extremists who are  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:45 Jul 22, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G21JY6.077 S21JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2011
1476,164,2011-07-21,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor  the American Volunteer Group (AVG)  known in China as ‘‘The Flying Tigers,’’ on the  occasion of its 70th anniversary.  In 1941, Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-  shek authorized retired U.S. Lieutenant General Claire Lee Chennault to create a group of  American pilots and airmen to assist and train  Chinese aerial forces. With President Franklin  D. Roosevelt’s  permission, Armed  Forces  members were allowed  to volunteer  for  this  assignment. In total, 97 pilots and 185 ground  personnel from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps volunteered.  The group faced many initial challenges. To  start, the group had 100 P–40 fighter planes  (painted with  the now-famous  ‘‘shark’s  face’’  nose), many of which were in less than ideal  condition. Additionally, the group had only four  months  to  train and prepare before action  started. However, the AVG was able to establish three separate squadrons: Adam and Eve,  the Panda Bears, and Hell’s Angels.  The group first saw action on December 20,  1941, just 12 days after the attack on Pearl  Harbor. While U.S. air forces and the Royal  Air Force were generally unsuccessful against  the Japanese at the war’s onset, the AVG was  notably successful, largely due to Chennault’s  innovative fighting tactics.  For their efforts, at the group’s 50th anniversary,  the AVG was rewarded veteran status  for service in World War II. The following year  they were also rewarded with the Presidential  Unit Citation.  In 1992, each member of  the  AVG  ground  personnel was  awarded  the  Bronze Star and pilots were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me  in honoring  the American Volunteer Group  ‘‘Flying Tigers,’’ whose bravery and courage in  the face of incredible difficulties will inspire future pilots and military servicemen and women  for years to come.  f  COMMEMORATING THE 37TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TURKISH OCCUPATION OF CYPRUS  HON.

1477,164,2011-07-21,Ms. BERKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to call  my colleagues’ attention to the 37th anniversary of the Turkish tragic invasion of Cyprus.  Turkey’s unlawful occupation, which began on  this day  in 1974,  left  thousands of  innocent  Greek Cypriot civilians without  their homes,  their land, and their families. It is crucial for us  to commemorate this unfortunate situation and  assist the people of Cyprus in reaching a solution.  Many of the Cypriot generation who suffered  the invasion have not lived to see justice or a  resolution  to  this conflict. Although many of  the survivors have had the opportunity to return to their homes on the northern side of the  island, it was only to discover them occupied  by Turkish settlers.  Only Turkey recognizes the occupied northern side of the country as a Turkish Cypriot  state, but  it does not even provide a valid  standard of living to their own citizens. This  was made evident  through  the recent demonstrations by Turkish Cypriots who have displayed their own dissatisfaction with the Turkish occupation.  Thirty-seven years after  the  invasion,  the  Turkish government continues to throw obstacles in the path to peace. Instead of compromising, Turkey threatens a deadlock on relations between Turkey and the European Union  if the Republic of Cyprus takes over the presidency of the European Union in July 2012. It  is clear that Cypriots of all kinds are ready for  peace, but how can peace be reached when  Turkey will not even accept Cyprus as a member of  the European Union? The  time has  come for Turkey to end their threats, withdraw  their troops, and return the territory that is not  rightfully theirs. That way, the Cypriots—and  the Cypriots alone—can make  the decisions  affecting their future.  f  DEBT REDUCTION PLANS EFFECTS  ON POVERTY  HON. MARCIA L. FUDGE  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 21, 2011  ",2011
1478,164,2011-07-21,Ms. FUDGE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  highlight the devastating effects of the Republican agenda on  the poor. Debt  reduction  plans that gut social safety net programs will  put millions of low-income families at risk.  According to the U.S. Census, the number  of people in poverty in 2009—43.6 million—is  the largest number in the 51 years for which  poverty estimates have been published.  In my home state of Ohio, 15.2 percent of  the state’s population lived in poverty in 2009.  Among African-American seniors, 67 percent  are at or below the poverty line, and 12 percent of African Americans rely on Medicare to  survive.  Cuts to Medicaid will disproportionately affect African-American communities.  In 2009,  27  percent  of  African-Americans—approximately 10 million people,  including 6 million  children—were covered by Medicaid.  When everyone talks about the budget, all  you hear about are numbers. Behind  those  numbers are people: hard-working Americans  or the unemployed or those who are just getting by.  There is an urgent need to resolve the debt  ceiling issue and it is beyond irresponsible not  to raise the debt limit. We all agree that we  have to responsibly reduce the deficit, but not  on the backs of the most vulnerable. My job  in Congress is to be a voice for the voiceless  and I will fight to help these Americans by opposing the Republican budget.

As  the Cohocton  Volunteer Fire Department celebrates its 125th  anniversary,  I applaud  the many ways  they  have served our community.  From July 22–24, members of the department will hold several events commemorating  the service of their valiant volunteers. Historical displays, parades, competitions and dinners will be held. The department will even be  publishing a commemorative book on its history to celebrate this milestone.  For the past 125 years, members have selflessly given their time and energy to serve our  community  throughout periods of emergency  and disaster. While  the Cohocton Volunteer  Fire Department should be commemorated for  all of their service to our community, I want to  especially highlight  their  tireless work during  the 1972 Flood, the Ice Storm of 1991 and the  Blizzard of 1993—three major storms which  devastated the Chemung Valley.  Furthermore, the department also aided the  national community during the terrorist attacks  of September II, 2001. Under a mutual aid request, the department sent an ambulance and  personnel to the Twin Towers Site after the attack. The ambulance was equipped with medical supplies donated by the local community  for use by the FDNY.  Members of  the Cohocton Volunteer Fire  Department have repeatedly risked their lives  in order to save our friends and neighbors. I  am proud to recognize such a self-sacrificing  and courageous organization.

RON PAUL  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 21, 2011  ",2011
1480,171,2011-07-21,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce  the Entrepreneurship Tax Cut Act of 2011.  This bill allows Americans  to make penalty-  free withdrawals from accounts such as Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) or 401(k)s  in order to start, or invest in, new businesses.  People who make  these penalty-free withdrawals will be able  to  replenish  their accounts.  One reason unemployment rates remain so  high is that entrepreneurs are unable to obtain  the capital  they need  to create new businesses and new  jobs. Clearly,  the policy of  throwing billions of  taxpayer dollars at big  banks and allowing  the Federal Reserve  to  shovel billions more into bank coffers has not  succeeded. Congress must come up with innovative ways to ensure entrepreneurs and investors can raise the funds to start new businesses and put Americans back to work. Letting Americans use more of  their money  to  start new businesses is a common sense solution  to  the unemployment problem. Therefore, I urge all my colleagues to help budding  entrepreneurs and  venture  capitalists build  new businesses and create the jobs of tomorrow by cosponsoring the Entrepreneurship Tax  Cut Act.  f  TRIBUTE TO MR.

(Joe) Salter, a longtime  resident of Albany, Georgia, who passed away  this spring after a series of serious health setbacks. Mr. Salter was 82 years old at the time  of his passing.  A native of Arlington, Georgia, Joe Salter  graduated from Arlington High School in 1945  and served in the United States Air Force during  the Korean War. A  few years  later,  in  1952, he graduated  from Emory University  and went on to spend most of his adult life as  a well-respected, successful realtor in the Albany area where he was also an active member of a number of different civic groups such  as the Albany Golden K Kiwanis Club, the Albany Jaycees and  the Albany Chamber of  Commerce.  In work and at home, Joe Salter was first  and foremost a man who loved his family, his  country and his God and not necessarily  in  that order. In practically everything he undertook, Mr. Salter sought  to expand personal  freedom and individual liberties. He was a frequent author of columns and op-ed pieces in  the local newspapers of Georgia and through  his diverse list of contacts around the country,  Mr. Salter soon became known for his heartfelt concerns about  the direction of our beloved country. While Joe Salter was the epitome of a southern gentleman, always courteous to one and all, he was also a textbook  example of an active and engaged citizen.  Many a mayor, congressman, senator and  governor knew when Joe Salter was concerned about a matter, especially the role of  limited government.  As a husband, father and grandfather, Joe  Salter loved his family and worked tirelessly to  leave behind a better community, state and  country for them to inherit. In addition to being  a dedicated family man, Mr. Salter was also a  real patriot who loved the men and women of  our nation’s military as well as our veterans  who, like Mr. Salter, had made a lifetime of  sacrifices for a better America.  Mr. Speaker, Joe B. Salter was not only a  true friend to all who knew him but he was an  inspiration to young and old alike and at this  time, I would ask the House to join me in extending our deepest sympathies to his widow,  Betty Ann, as well as their daughter, Florrie,  her husband, Tracy, their son, John, as well  as  their  three grandchildren, Raleigh Elizabeth, Callie Grace and Benjamin Avert.  f  RECOGNIZING WILLIAM VANDER  ARK  HON.

1482,171,2011-07-21,Mr. YODER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize William Vander Ark of Leawood,  Kansas. William was diagnosed with Type 1  diabetes when he was 8 years old. William  must act as a mathematician, a physician, a  personal  trainer and a dietician  just  to stay  alive. His insulin pump functions as his lifeline.  This summer William  joined 150 children  and teens who participated in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Children’s Congress  in Washington, DC. Collectively,  they  are  fighting  for a cure and working  to help  raise research money for this chronic, debilitating disease  that affects nearly 26 million  Americans nationwide.  William  is entering high school  in  the  fall  and wants a cure for Type 1 diabetes so the  disease doesn’t change the course of his future. His dream  is  to become a commercial  pilot, but current rules prevent those who have  Type 1 diabetes from getting a license. While  the  law  is  in place because of safety concerns, there have been large strides in the development  of  new,  transformational  technologies since its passage. Despite adversity,  William is committed to his dream and knows  that if he keeps his mind to it and works hard,  he can someday change the rules.  One of these new technologies is the development of an artificial pancreas that is at a  critical point in the regulatory process.

1490,9,2011-08-02,Mr. MERKLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  to address  the Obama-Boehner debt  deal. I must say it is an issue on which  I have been immersed in wrestling to  understand the impact on unemployment, the impact on investments that  will strengthen our Nation down the  road; certainly an impact on programs  that strengthen our families. It is in  that context we try to understand how  do we build the strongest possible Nation for working families. How do we  do that? Is the Obama-Boehner debt  deal the right path? I must conclude  that it is not the right path. I conclude  that for four reasons.  The first is the impact on jobs. We  are facing a gathering storm on the job  front. We have 5 to 8 million additional  foreclosures that are suppressing the  success of our construction market,  driving down the value of houses and  having a devastating impact on the attempts at a recovery.  Second, the unemployment benefits.  The extended unemployment benefits  expire this year, and the rough estimate is that that will result in a reduction of around 500,000 jobs. That is a  tremendous blow in 2012. Then we have  the termination of a payroll tax holiday and the estimate is that may well  produce  losses of  jobs of more than  900,000 across America. Add them and  you are talking about nearly 1.5 million lost jobs that we will face in 2012.

1491,16,2011-08-02,Ms.  MIKULSKI.,"  Mr.  President,  through  serious negotiation,  leaders  from both parties and the President  have reached a bipartisan solution that  will lift our debt ceiling and prevent a  downgrade of our credit.  Make no mistake, this agreement is  stark and stern but necessary. It includes cuts that I would have never  voted  for  under  different  circumstances. However, if we fail to take  action,  the  economy will be  irrevocably fractured.  While  it  is  far  from perfect,  the  agreement meets my  principles  for  avoiding default and downgrade. It provides a long-term extension of the debt  ceiling, a significant downpayment on  cuts, and a path forward to reform tax  earmarks and entitlements.  The consequences of a default and  downgrade would be significant and severe and would alter the course of the  United States for a century. Default  would have  led to sky-high  interest  rates that would have created a new  tax on every single American. It means  if you have a variable rate mortgage, it  would skyrocket. If you have a student  loan, the interest would increase. And  if you have a car loan, the payments  would be greater.  Under default, the President would  also have to prioritize what obligations  to pay. First, we would have to pay our  troops. Then we would have to meet  our obligations to seniors and veterans.  Federal  funding  for State and  local  governments  would  run  out.  This  would affect  infrastructure projects,  funding for schools and teachers and  firehouses and police stations. Contractors who work for the Federal Government would face layoffs without pay,  and businesses would  reduce hiring.  The economy would be further weakened, and it would be a self-inflicted  wound. I could not allow this to happen.  I took an oath to protect and defend  the Constitution. The 14th amendment  says  that  the validity of America’s  debt must not be questioned. While the  lawyers made the interpretation complicated, the framers made it simple.  America pays its debt with no exceptions. Failure to reach an agreement  would be a violation of the American  people and our creditors’ trust. And it  would have violated my oath to the  Constitution.  America must meet its obligations to  its creditors. We must also meet our  obligations to each other. Throughout  this debate, I have insisted on no benefit cuts to soldiers, seniors, and veterans, and I will continue to do so. Obligations made must be obligations  kept.  I will also fight to fulfill our obligations to the next generation who will  lead us through the 21st century. We  can’t cut our way to a new economy.  We need to invest in it by rebuilding  roads, bridges, and increasing access to  broadband. This is what will lead to  new  jobs, new opportunity, and new  prosperity.  We also need to invest in education,  science,  research  and  technology.  These investments will lead to jobs of  the  future and prepare students and  workers to compete in a global economy. This means making  sure kids  have access to higher or career education. It means supporting scientists  who are finding cures for the most devastating diseases. And it means giving  businesses the tools they need to develop new products. We can’t afford not  to make these investments.  After wrenching analysis, I will vote  for this bipartisan agreement because  it is an achievable and pragmatic solution to the crisis that would be caused  by inaction. It will require tough action and  strong medicine down  the  road, but it is necessary to honor our  obligations to the greatest generation  and the next generation.  ",2011

Default would have increased interest  rates for every American with a mortgage, car loan, student debt or credit  card. For these reasons, I voted to support this agreement.  Critically, the deal protects Social  Security, Medicaid, Medicare and veterans from benefit cuts and leaves open  future opportunities to fight tax loopholes, sweetheart deals and giveaways  for special interests. I will certainly  continue these  fights and seek comprehensive  tax  reform  to guarantee  that there is a fair balance and truly  shared sacrifice.  Now more than ever, we must move  to focus on our number one priority—  creating  jobs and spurring economic  growth. Americans are still hurting,  seeking to  find work, stay  in their  homes, pay  tuition  for  schools and  keep their families together. We must  put Connecticut and America back to  work and get our country moving in  the right direction.  ",2011
1498,23,2011-08-02,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, debate  over the fiscal future of our Nation has  been at the center of the 112th Congress. With the passage today of the  Budget Control Act of 2011, we have  avoided a default on our national debt,  we have made a significant downpayment on our deficit, and we are establishing a Joint Select Committee that  provides a real opportunity to achieve  even greater deficit reduction by the  end of this year.  As chairman of the Senate Budget  Committee, I am privileged to have a  staff of dedicated professionals who advise me on  the complicated budget  issues that have been before this body.  My staff also shares its expertise with  Members on both sides of the aisle.  They are a credit to the Senate, and I  would like to take this opportunity to  thank them for their hard work during  the session.  Budget  Committee  staff  director  Mary Naylor deserves particular credit  for putting together a team that regularly provides thorough and accurate  analysis, often on incredibly short notice. Deputy staff director John Righter also deserves a special mention. Mr.  Righter’s mastery  of  baselines  and  scoring has been invaluable as we have  developed and compared various plans  to address our long-term fiscal issues.  Deputy staff director Joel Friedman  and committee chief counsel Joe Gaeta  have also played a critical role in the  committee’s work this session.  The committee has a dedicated communications  staff,  including  Stu  Nagurka, Steve Posner, Adam Hughes,  and Kobye Noel, that ensures that the  committee’s analysis is made available  to Members and the general public in a  clear, concise, and timely manner. In  addition,  committee  analysts Steve  Bailey, Jeannie Biniek, Amy Edwards,  Jennifer  Hanson-Kilbride,  Robyn  Hiestand, Mike Jones, Sarah Kuehl  Egge, Matthew Levy, Jim Miller, Matt  Mohning,  Michael  Obeiter,  Miles  Patrie, and Brandon Teachout each  have expertise in specific policy areas  that has proven invaluable to me as  the committee has reviewed every aspect of the Federal budget. The committee’s support staff and staff assistants, Anne Page,  Josh Ryan, Ben  Soskin,  and Ronald Storhaug  have  worked  late nights and weekends to  make sure we all meet the demands  placed on us. And finally, I would like  to recognize committee’s chief clerk  Lynne Seymour  and  administrative  staffers  George  Woodall,  Letitia  Fletcher, Cathey Dugan, and Kathleen  Llewellyn-Butts, who provide support  to both sides of the Budget Committee.  We as Senators place incredible demands on our staff, and they deserve to  have their service to this institution  and our  country  recognized. As we  move to the next chapter of our debate  over the  federal budget,  I offer my  most  sincere  appreciation  for  their  hard work.  ",2011
1499,23,2011-08-02,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, over the  last several weeks, we have been debating the increase in the debt ceiling. For  the time being, that debate is coming  to an end. But I would like to address  briefly some revisionist fiscal history  that we have heard repeated during  that debate.  We have heard  this historical account often over the past decade. You  hear it from our friends on the other  side whenever  the Senate  discusses  spending policy and tax policy. I have  noticed that the arguments boil down  to two points. My friend and colleague,  the  former  chairman  and  ranking  member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator GRASSLEY, came up  with this thumbnail description of this  creative historical account.  First, all of the ‘‘good’’ fiscal history  of the 1990s was derived from the partisan tax increase bill of 1993.  And second, all of the ‘‘bad’’ fiscal  history taking place within the past 10  years is because of the bipartisan tax  relief plans originally enacted during  the last administration and continued  under the present administration.  You could go one step further and, as  a policy premise, refine that thumbnail  description  to  two  short  sentences.  First sentence—lower taxes are bad.  Second  sentence—higher  taxes  are  good. Not  surprisingly,  these  revisionist historians support higher taxes  and higher government spending. And  not surprisingly, the revisionists oppose cutting taxes and cutting government spending.  Since time is short today, I direct  folks to Senate floor remarks I made  on February 14, 2011. They are available on the Senate Finance Committee  under the Ranking Members Newsroom  tab for that date. But it is important  to reiterate the main point of those remarks. Basically the assertion by our  friends on the other side that raising  taxes is the key to all good fiscal history can be summarily dismissed.  Let’s take a quick view of the 1990s  data. According to the Clinton administration’s Office of Management and  Budget—or OMB—the  impact of  the  much-bragged about tax hike bill of  1993 was minimal. The Clinton administration’s OMB concluded that the 1993  tax increase accounted for only 13 percent of deficit reduction between 1990  and 2000. Thirteen percent puts the 1993  tax increase behind other factors such  as defense cuts, other revenue, and interest savings. The data show that tax  increases did not drive deficit reduction.  So as a matter of fact, only 13 percent of the positive fiscal history of the  1990s is due to the partisan 1993 tax increase? That is it. Thirteen percent.  Well, what about the  last decade?  The period of 2001–2010 saw a lot of deficits. From what you hear  from our  friends on the other side, those deficits  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:37 Aug 03, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G02AU6.041 S02AUPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B 6 X X D 1 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011

1501,30,2011-08-02,Mr. CORKER.," Mr. President, I want  to speak just momentarily about the  legislation that was just passed.  I, for the last 14 months traveling my  State in almost every nook and cranny, have talked about the situation our  country is in, talked about possible solutions,  and  offered  legislation—the  only bipartisan, bicameral legislation  offered until this point—to deal with  our country’s deficits and debt.  I had hoped that we would figure out  a way to deal with $5 trillion to $7 trillion worth of spending and/or savings  over the next 10 years, and finally decided that $4 trillion was the magic  number.  I  know  the markets  had  looked at  that,  the  rating agencies  looked at that, the people who buy our  Treasurys had looked at that number.  Over the course of the last few weeks,  it became apparent that $3 trillion was  probably the most that was going to be  achieved, and then now we have ended  up with this bill that passed today, and  I supported that hoping to achieve $2.1  trillion to $2.4 trillion in savings over  the next decade.  Mr. President, obviously, like many  of us in this body on both sides of the  aisle who know our country is in dire  straits and we have a lot of work to do,  I am disappointed at the magnitude of  this legislation. But I am hopeful and  thankful that we have taken the first  step. I think this is going to be a decade of us having to focus on our country’s  irresponsibility  over  the  past  many years. Both parties, no doubt,  have been responsible for putting us in  this situation. It is going to take both  parties to move us away from where we  are. But I think everyone in this body  fully understands that on the present  course our country’s best days are behind us. I think all of us want to ensure  that  this  country’s  greatness  continues; that we can continue to display  American exceptionalism not only here  but around the world.  I look at this solely as the first step.  I know we are going to have an appropriations opportunity to look at even  more savings at the end of September.  I know we are going to have a committee that is going to be looking at  this during the months of November  and December. I know we are going to  have a series of opportunities for us to  deal with this. Again, today was just a  first step.  I learned through a lifetime of business, starting with doing very, very  small projects at the age of 25 when I  first went in business, that as a company, you can never go broke taking a  profit. What I have learned in the Senate  is you  should never  say no  to  spending cuts.  So while these spending cuts are not  of the magnitude that I would like to  have seen, I think this is a very good  first step and is something that we can  all build upon. I look forward to working with people on both sides of the  aisle to ensure that this is just the  first step and that our country continues to have the discipline, the fortitude, the courage, and the will to  make the tough decisions that all of us  know we are going to need to make  over the course of the next many years.  That  is what we owe these young  pages who are getting ready to leave  after service to this country over the  last month; that is what we owe future  generations;  that  is what we  owe  Americans; and, candidly, that is what  we owe the world as citizens of this  world; that is, for us to be disciplined  and to know that we have to live within our means and to know the best  thing we can possibly do as a country  at this moment in time is to show we  have that courage and that will.  Mr. President, I thank you for the  time to speak on this topic. I know all  of us leave here and go home to recess.  I know many of us will be talking  about the vast amount of work that  needs to be done as it relates to making sure we rein in this out-of-control  spending that has been taking place for  many years. I look forward to that. I  look  forward  to  talking  to citizens  back in Tennessee, and I look forward  to coming back in September and dealing with folks on both sides of the aisle  to make sure we put that thought into  action.  I yield the floor.  ",2011

1503,30,2011-08-02,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President, I want to  thank the Senator from Tennessee, Mr.  CORKER, for what he just said. I want  to affirm the extraordinary amount of  effort he has made to not only inform  this Senate body of the crisis that we  face financially, but also to come forward with some very constructive solutions on how to deal with this crisis.  I know he is disappointed that we  were not able to reach a better solution  than the one voted on today. I know he  struggled to decide what was the best  course to follow moving forward. In the  end, he decided to support the bill as a  first step; but, as he said, this is the  first step of what probably will be a  decade-long challenge facing all of us  to successfully address this deep hole  of debt we have dug for ourselves as a  nation.  I rise today to speak, sharing all  those  concerns,  certainly  believing  that our work has  just started and  there is much more to do. But also as  someone who decided to vote against  the bill that we just had before us. I  have not taken this vote lightly.  For the past 11⁄2years, as a candidate  I traveled the State of Indiana, to just  about every town and city in the State,  talking to thousands and thousands of  Hoosiers on a day-after-day basis hearing what they had to say. If, frankly, I  could categorize their thoughts  into  one statement, it would be a deep concern about the future of our country  and a deep desire to have their elected  representatives go to Washington and  do everything they can to address this  situation.  I have spent the last 7 months in the  Senate hearing from hundreds, if not  thousands, of Hoosiers who have written, called, visited, and talked with me  back at home. Nothing has changed except the urgency of these concerns, and  the deep worries that they have expressed have simply grown.  We saw, in 2010, Americans across the  country express their desire for Congress to get hold of our fiscal situation;  that the era of spending, of promising  beyond our means, was over, and that  we had to take major steps to reverse  that. That is why I decided to return to  the Senate, to come back to work to  help repair our country’s economic future.  I came back  to work on  the  things that many consider politically  toxic: entitlement reform, tax reform,  passing a balanced budget amendment  to make sure that we would never end  up in this situation again; that if there  was a legacy that we could pass on to  our children, if there was something  that we could do for the future of our  country, something that we could do  for our children and grandchildren, and  everyone’s children and grandchildren,  it would be to never have them have to  go through what we are going through  now because we had taken fiscal responsibility, passing a balanced budget  amendment  that would,  as we  are  sworn in, require each of us to come  here and put our left hand on the Bible  and our right hand in the air, to repeat  the oath to honor the Constitution, and  that Constitution would attain a balanced budget amendment as a requirement.  So before taking this vote, I pondered  for days and nights about the many  Hoosiers who had put their faith and  confidence in me and sent me back to  the Senate to do everything I could to  accomplish this goal. Some of those  Hoosiers had tears in their eyes, worried about the future for themselves  and for their children. Some had fingers in my chest, saying: Don’t let me  down. Don’t go and settle for too little.  Do everything you can. That is what I  have tried to do.  After giving it consideration, I decided not to support this bill because I  could not come to grips with having to  come back and tell Hoosiers that this  is the best we could do.  I do wish to recognize the work and  leadership, the strategy and the efforts  of our minority leader, Senator MCCONNELL, and whip, Senator KYL, those in  leadership and others—JOHNBOEHNER  and ERICCANTOR in the House and the  people who represented Republicans at  the White House.

U.S.  Navy LCDR Jane Lanham Tafoya was  assigned to the Naval Branch Health  Clinic in Manama, Bahrain, in support  of Operation Iraqi Freedom. She died  from non-combat  related  causes on  September 19, 2006. She was 43 years  old.  For her heroic service, Lieutenant  Commander  Tafoya  received many  awards, medals and decorations,  including the Navy and Marine Corps  Commendation Medal with Gold Star,  the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal,  the National Defense  Service Medal with Bronze Star, the  Global War  on  Terrorism  Service  Medal,  the Armed  Forces Reserve  Medal, and the Navy Pistol Shot Medal  with Sharpshooter Device.  Lieutenant Commander Tafoya had  served for 18 years in the Navy. Before  her assignment  in Bahrain  she had  served at the Naval Hospital and Naval  Reserve Center in Philadelphia, the Bureau of Medicine here in Washington,  DC,  the Naval Hospital  at  Camp  Lejeune, NC, aboard the U.S.S. Ronald  Reagan, and at Navy Environmental  Preventive Medicine Unit 2 in Norfolk,  VA. In Bahrain she was working as an  industrial hygienist.  Born  in Daviess County, KY, Jane  was a graduate of Owensboro Catholic  High School, Murray State University  and Temple University. Her mother,  Avis Lanham, remembers Jane as a  smart student who enjoyed learning,  got all As in school, and loved to read.  In high school Jane played softball and  volleyball, and she was on the Murray  State intramural bowling team.  Avis says that Jane loved to travel,  and she loved being in the Navy.

Whenever something negative was said  about a person, Jane would  just respond with, ‘‘Well, nobody’s perfect.’’  We are thinking of Jane’s loved ones  today,  including her husband John  Tafoya; her daughters Rachel and Natalie Tafoya; her mother Avis Lanham;  her brother and sister-in-law Brad and  Kathy; her sister and brother-in-law  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:25 Aug 03, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G02AU6.076 S02AUPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B 6 X X D 1 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011
1507,44,2011-08-02,Mr. BARRASSO.," Mr. President, it is  fitting that Harriet Hageman will be  inducted into the 2011 Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. Harriet is known  across Wyoming and across our Nation  as a stalwart promoter and defender of  agriculture. With this honor, she is following in the footsteps of her father  Jim Hageman, who was previously inducted in the Agriculture Hall of fame  in 2002.  Harriet comes from a long history of  agricultural  producers.  Her  great  grandfather homesteaded in Wyoming  in 1879 and her parents bought their  first ranch near Fort Laramie in 1961.  Harriet grew up on the family’s cattle  ranches  in  the Fort Laramie area.  Rather than pursuing a career in agriculture, she earned a law degree from  the University of Wyoming. Yet she did  not stray from the agriculture industry. Much of her  legal practice has  been  focused  on  protecting  agriculture’s land, water, and natural resources. She uses her Ag background  coupled with her fine mind to effectively argue on behalf of Wyoming’s  ranchers and farmers in courtrooms at  all levels of the judiciary.  A few of her many accomplishments  should be noted. Harriet was the lead  attorney for the State of Wyoming in  protecting its share of the North Platte  River. She fought the USDA to protect  Wyoming’s access to national  forest  lands. She successfully defended Wyoming’s Open Range Law before the Wyoming Supreme Court. Her clients include ranchers, farmers, irrigation districts and grazing permitees. Harriet  represents them with a passion that  can only come from love of agriculture.  I have had the honor of working with  Harriet Hageman and have benefitted  from her wisdom. I would ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating  Harriet on this well-deserved honor.  f  TRIBUTE TO NIELS HANSEN  ",2011
1508,44,2011-08-02,Mr. BARRASSO.," Mr. President, at  Wyoming’s State Fair, I will have the  honor of inducting Niels Hansen into  the Wyoming  Agriculture  Hall  of  Fame.  Forty-eight  percent  of Wyoming’s  97,100 square miles are managed by the  Federal Government. Often, a Wyoming ranch will consist of a checkerboard of public and private lands. Running a profitable ranch, while negotiating various Federal and State regulations, is a challenge. However, Niels  Hansen has done just that operating  the PH Livestock Company. Niels is  known as the public  lands ranching  leader of Wyoming. He has dedicated  himself to building relationships with  Federal  land managers. He  creates  partnerships and opens lines of communication with fellow ranchers and government agencies. According  to my  friend, Wyoming Stock Growers Association vice president Jim Magana,  Niels is highly recognized for his relentless efforts to maintain sustainable  public land ranching.  Niels’ efforts not only benefit his  four-generation Wyoming ranch, he is  also an asset to agriculturalists across  Wyoming. He has worked closely with  the Bureau  of Land Management’s,  BLM, field office range staff and has  been a State leader on agreements in  conjunction with the BLM, U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Services,  the Wyoming  Game and Fish Department, and the  Wyoming State Grazing Board. Realizing that energy is the backbone of  Wyoming’s economy, Neils has brought  oil and gas developers to the table.  Anna Helm, Niels’ sister and ranch  partner,  said,  ‘‘Many  ranchers have  come to depend upon his insightful wisdom, understanding of the issues and  willing  leadership  to  help  them  through difficult times of their own.’’  I ask my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Niels Hansen, the 2011  inductee into the Wyoming Agriculture  Hall of Fame. Wyoming  lands—both  public and private—are better because  of his service.  f  NIOBRARA COUNTY, WYOMING  ",2011
1509,44,2011-08-02,Mr. BARRASSO.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  honor  the Centennial  of  Niobrara County, WY.  The residents of Niobrara County are  fortunate to live in such a timeless and  scenic place. Nearly 2,500 residents live  in the communities of Lusk, Manville,  Lance Creek, and Van Tassel. Its many  natural wonders that fill the landscape  make Niobrara one of the top places to  visit in the State. Part of the county  includes land set aside and known as  the Thunder Basin National Grasslands. This area provides a valuable  habitat for Wyoming’s wildlife and numerous recreation opportunities for its  residents. Two  rivers,  the Cheyenne  and  the Niobrara,  run  through  the  county and can be credited for creating  rich, fertile soil in the area.  Although Niobrara County is one of  the smallest counties in the State, it  certainly has one of  the most  fascinating histories. The county boasts a  wide array of prehistoric dinosaur fossils at  its premier Spanish Diggings  site. Several rare artifacts have been  found and are displayed in national exhibits. The region also saw heavy traffic from Native Americans who used  the grasslands as prime hunting and  camping areas. Members of the Lakota  Sioux, the Cheyenne, and the Kiowa  tribes settled in the area many years  ago.  With the great westward expansion  came the greater urbanization of the  West. Niobrara County was not  immune from such development—instead,  it embraced the changes. The grassland  area of the county became a popular  area for fur traders, homesteaders, and  other emigrants caught in the throes of  gold  rush  excitement. One  popular  stage stop, Running Water, was located  along the banks of the Niobrara River  and was used by several travelers as a  spot to rest and refuel. The Cheyenne-  Deadwood Stage Route, which traveled  the length of the county, provided important transport of freight, gold, and  passengers. This important route and  the additional stage lines which passed  through were essential to the development of the county.  Today,  the  residents  of Niobrara  County have capitalized on that industrious spirit. Thanks to the temperate  climate and the fertile soil in the Powder River Basin, Niobrara County’s primary  industry  is  agriculture.  The  county’s farmers consistently produce  profitable crops like grain, wheat, and  beans, and its ranchers work diligently  in livestock production. The county’s  vast mineral resources played a key  role in the county’s robust economy.  Several minerals and precious metals  have been discovered and mined in the  grasslands of Niobrara County. Both  gold and silver were discovered and  mined in the early days of settlement.  Later, uranium was discovered near  Lusk, a discovery which  sparked a  statewide boom  in uranium drilling.  Finally, the discovery of oil in Lance  Creek was perhaps the most profitable  of all mineral extraction. During World  War II, Lance Creek was one of the  country’s important oil rigs, producing  vast amounts of oil needed  for the  American war effort.  It is an honor to help the residents of  Niobrara County celebrate their 100th  anniversary. I invite my colleagues to  visit this enterprising community in  person.  The  residents  of  Niobrara  County should be proud to present this  heritage to visitors from all over the  world.  f  UCON, IDAHO  ",2011
1510,44,2011-08-02,Mr. RISCH.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to congratulate and acknowledge  the  centennial  anniversary  of  the  founding of the city of Ucon, ID. On  August 13, 2011, the citizens of Ucon  will gather at Simmons Park to commemorate its 100th year and unveil a  monument to its founders. This is a  very historic and special day for this  community.  Once a barren wilderness, the city of  Ucon is an example of the Western spirit and determination  in making the  desert bloom. First colonized in 1884 by  George Simmons, early settlers were  confronted with challenging  terrain.  Despite the harsh conditions, the settlement quickly grew. Within 13 years,  a church, school, amusement hall, and  several dozen homes were built.

1513,65,2011-08-02,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  rise today to introduce Early Intervention for Graduation Success Authorization Act. This legislation would, if enacted, amend the current School Dropout Prevention provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  It would focus attention on identifying  and helping students who are at risk to  not graduate from high school as early  as pre-kindergarten and through elementary and middle school.  Some may ask, ‘‘Why are you concentrating on toddlers and elementary  school children when you are trying to  solve the high school dropout crisis  facing our Nation? Why not focus attention and our Nation’s  scarce  resources on high school students, or  even middle school students?’’  The reason  is simple. Early on  is  when  children’s  troubles  in  school  begin, and an ounce of prevention is  worth a pound of cure. High school and  middle  school  students do not  just  wake up one day and say, ‘‘I think I’ll  drop out of school today.’’ Twenty-five  years of research tells us that dropping  out is a long process of frustration,  alienation, and even boredom, it is not  a sudden decision. We know that students with disabilities, minority and  poor  children,  and  students whose  home lives are, in all sorts of ways, difficult have lower graduation rates than  their peers. The challenges children  face today are all too prevalent, and we  know the factors that make it harder  for them to succeed in school. We know  this.  It only makes sense that we re-work  the program that is intended to help  schools increase their graduation rates  so that it actually helps schools help  children when we can make the most  difference. We need to act before these  children have fought for years just to  stay afloat, and before they are too  tired, frustrated, alienated, and angry  to fight anymore.  Factors  that have been  shown  to  present a significant risk factor even in  elementary  school  include:  low  achievement, grade retention, poor attendance, misbehavior and aggression,  and low socioeconomic status. Family  background characteristics play a role  as well, such as family disruption, not  living with parents, and parents’ low  educational  attainment.  Even  low  birth weight has been shown by numerous studies to be linked with poor educational outcomes.  My ‘‘Early Intervention for Graduation Success’’ bill would focus Federal  funds on states that have the lowest  graduation  rates.  State  education  agencies would be required to develop  or update their plans to increase graduation rates. They would also be required to work with health, social services,  juvenile  justice, and other relevant state agencies to help school districts and early childhood education  providers better identify which of their  students have research-based risk factors. In turn, schools and early learning providers would be required to develop and update  individual  learning  plans  for these students and ensure  that the next school of enrollment has  the child’s plan.  My bill also gives States and partnerships a menu of research-based activities from which to choose to improve  services to students, including professional development, program quality  improvement,  curriculum  alignment,  community  integration  and  support  services, and setting high expectations  for academic achievement.  In short, my bill helps States and  schools to give students the support  they need to achieve their dreams, and  inspires them to dream big, right from  the very start.  We can continue to spend millions of  dollars every year on intensive services  for teenagers who are  far behind  in  school, who are frustrated beyond all  measure, and who gave up on success  long ago. We may even have some limited success helping some young people  get back on track and graduate from  high school. Or, we can start at the beginning, making sure that the children  who already have challenges get the  help they need to succeed.  I look forward to passage of this bill  or incorporating it into the reauthorization of  the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

1515,72,2011-08-02,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, today  Senator ALEXANDERand I rise to recognize over  250 Nurse-Managed Health  Clinics in a Resolution designating the  week of October 2, 2011, as National  Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week.  Nurse-managed health clinics provide  primary care and wellness services to a  diverse  population  through  all  age  groups and ethnicities. These clinics  provide care to over two million patients  in underserved or vulnerable  areas across this country. Nurse-managed health clinics offer a full range of  accessible and affordable health services,  including primary care, health  promotion, and disease prevention to  low-income, as well as un-and under insured patients, regardless of their ability to pay. The care is primarily provided by nurse practitioners working in  partnership with an  interdisciplinary  team of health professions  including  clinical nurse  specialists,  registered  nurses, health educators, community  outreach workers,  health  care  students, and collaborating physicians. As  recognized by the Institute of Medicine’s ‘‘Future of Nursing’’ report, the  nurse managed clinics play a critical  role  in  community-based  preventive  health care and have done so since  their inception three decades ago.  A Senate resolution will help pave  the way for this effort. We ask our colleagues to join us in supporting this  tribute to Nurse-Managed Health Clinics.  f  SENATE  CONCURRENT  RESOLUTION 28—AUTHORIZING THE USE  OF EMANCIPATION HALL IN THE  CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER FOR  AN EVENT TO AWARD THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL, COLLECTIVELY, TO THE  100TH  INFANTRY BATTALION, 442ND REGIMENTAL  COMBAT  TEAM, AND  THE  MILITARY  INTELLIGENCE  SERVICE, UNITED STATES ARMY,  IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR DEDICATED SERVICE DURING WORLD  WAR II  Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mrs.  BOXER) submitted the  following concurrent resolution; which was referred  to the Committee on Rules and Administration:  S.

RES. 254  Whereas the airborne forces of the Armed  Forces have a long and honorable history as  bold and fierce warriors who, for the national security of the United States and the  defense of freedom and peace, project the  ground combat power of the United States  by air transport to the far reaches of the battle area and to the far corners of the world;  Whereas  the United States’ experiment  with airborne operations began on June 25,  1940, when the Army Parachute Test Platoon  was first authorized by the Department of  War, and 48 volunteers began training  in  July 1940;  Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary  of the first official Army parachute jump on  August 16, 1940, to test the innovative concept of inserting United States ground combat forces behind a battle line by means of a  parachute;  Whereas the success of the Army Parachute Test Platoon in the days immediately  before the entry of the United States into  World War II validated the airborne operational concept and led to the creation of a  formidable  force  of  airborne  formations,  such as the 11th, 13th, 17th, 82nd, and 101st  Airborne Divisions;  Whereas included in these divisions, and  among  other  separate  formations, were  many airborne combat, combat support, and  combat service support units that served  with distinction and achieved repeated success in armed hostilities that provide the lineage and  legacy of many airborne units  throughout our Armed Forces;  Whereas the achievements of the airborne  forces during World War II prompted the evolution of those forces into a diversified force  of parachute and air-assault units that, over  the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam,  Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf region,  and Somalia, and have engaged  in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;  Whereas since the terrorist attacks on September  11,  2001, United States  airborne  forces, which include members of the XVIII  Airborne Corps, the 82nd Airborne Division,  the 101st Airborne Division, the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, the 4th Brigade  Combat Team (Airborne) of the 25th Infantry  Division, the 75th Ranger Regiment, and special operations forces of the Army, Marine  Corps, Navy, and Air Force, together with  other units of the Armed Forces, have demonstrated bravery and honor in combat, stability, and training operations in Afghanistan and Iraq;  Whereas  the modern-day airborne  force  also includes other elite forces composed of  airborne trained and qualified special operations warriors,  including Army Special  Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units,  Navy SEALs, and Air Force combat control  and para-rescue teams;  Whereas of the members and former members of the United States airborne forces,  thousands have achieved the distinction of  making combat jumps, dozens have earned  the Medal of Honor, and hundreds have  earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the  Silver Star, or other decorations and awards  for displays of heroism, gallantry,  intrepidity, and valor;  Whereas the members and former members  of the United States airborne forces are all  members of a proud and honorable tradition  that, together with their special skills and  achievements, distinguishes such members  as intrepid combat parachutists, air assault  forces,  special  operation  forces,  and,  in  former days, glider troops;  Whereas the history and achievements of  the members and  former members of the  United States airborne forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of the people of the United States; and  Whereas since the airborne forces, past and  present, celebrate August 16 as the anniversary of the first official jump by the Army  Parachute Test Platoon, August 16 is an appropriate day to recognize as National Airborne Day: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the Senate—  (1) designates August 16, 2011, as ‘‘National  Airborne Day’’; and  (2) calls on the people of the United States  to observe National Airborne Day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.  f  NATIONAL CHESS DAY  ",2011

There being no objection, the Senate  proceeded to consider the resolution.  Mr ROCKEFELLER: Mr. President, I  rise today in support of this resolution  to designate National Chess Day as October 8, 2011. I greatly appreciate the  support  of my  colleague,  Senator  LAMARALEXANDERof Tennessee.  National Chess Day is designed to enhance awareness and encourage students and adults to engage in a game  known  to enhance critical  thinking  and problem-solving skills.  There  are  76,000 members  of  the  Chess Federation and half of them are  students. Studies indicate that chess  programs can help with students improving in math and reading. Engaging  students in such activities can make  learning fun and help them develop a  lifelong pastime to engage their skills.  Engaging students in chess is a wonderful opportunity  to promote  education, and I hope as school begins in a  few weeks, more students will join the  Chess Federation and learn this historical game.

1538,100,2011-08-02,Mr. TOWNS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  recognition of Harvey Lawrence and his exceptional service  to  the public health of his  community and his ongoing public service career.  Mr. Lawrence began his career by attaining  a Master of Science degree in Management  Science and Policy Analysis  from Harriman  college and SUNY Stony Brook. He is also a  graduate of  the Johnson & Johnson/UCLA  Health Care Executive Certificate Program.  Mr. Lawrence has been serving in the capacity of President and CEO of the Brownsville Multi-Service Family Health Center since  January 2009. Before his assent to President,  Mr. Lawrence served as the Corporation’s Executive Vice President and COO. Working with  the Brownsville Family Health Center since  1994, Mr. Lawrence has been responsible for  most of the new initiatives and expansions the  corporation has taken on.  Using his vast experience in public finance  and non-profit development, Mr. Lawrence has  been able to accelerate the growth of this corporation and provide more services  to  the  public. Mr. Lawrence began his public service  career as Management Trainee at  the Port  Authority of New York/New Jersey and quickly  gained experience  in NYC’s Office of Economic Development.  Mr. Lawrence is a former non-profit developer for affordable housing and vice president  in the investment banking, public finance and  real estate divisions of the former Manufacturers Hanover Trust Bank. Using his knowledge,  Mr. Lawrence maintains his position as the executive director of the city’s industrial commercial incentive board and senior finance/development director at the NYC Public Development Corporation.  Mr. Lawrence is a man of exceptional character and one that has been humbled through  his ability to serve those with greater needs.

1539,100,2011-08-02,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of the Women’s Civic Improvement  Club, WCIC, as they celebrate their 75th anniversary.  It  is my pleasure  to  recognize  the  Women’s Civic Improvement Club’s dedication  to promoting  the professional and personal  growth of members of the Sacramento region.  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring their leadership.  The Women’s  Civic  Improvement  Club  began in 1936 as the Negro Women’s Civic  Improvement Club. The Club was created to  provide housing for African American women  that had moved to Sacramento to work at the  McClellan Air Force Base. At the time, racial  segregation and  the  financial devastation of  the Great Depression made  finding a safe  home next to impossible for many women. In  1945, the Club’s Board of Directors signed incorporation  papers  and  the  name  was  changed, making it the WCIC that we know of  today. Throughout all of the changes our nation has faced since 1936, the WCIC has remained strong and relevant to those of us in  Sacramento.  Over the course of the last 75 years, the  WCIC has evolved  into an organization  that  helps people from low-income and disadvantaged families. The Club has expanded to include several new programs, helping individuals of all ages grow through community involvement. Their congregate meal program  provides  food and  recreational activities  for  senior citizens, allows members of  the program to get a healthy meal, and provides opportunities to socialize and be involved in the  community. Moreover,  the Playmate Head  Start Program provides quality childcare to its  members and has maintained an excellent  focus on healthy child development.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to  the Women’s Civic Improvement Club on their  75th anniversary, and  to  their outstanding  commitment to improve our community. I ask  my colleagues  to  join with me  in congratulating them on their 75 years of success.  f  PROCLAMATION  HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR.

1542,107,2011-08-02,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  in strong opposition to the Budget Control Act  of 2011, S. 365.  First, with all the conflict and frustration surrounding this vote, I’m reverting to basic principles. One of which is, ‘‘don’t negotiate with  thugs.’’ It’s been long obvious that we have no  partner with whom to negotiate; only a party  that started as our comrades in government,  then our colleagues, who evolved into our opponents, declared  themselves our enemies  and now demand that we be their enablers. I  refuse to play.  Thugs are in the game to destroy, not build.  They would destroy the government, and especially this presidency. They take hostages,  and there is much work at stake that would be  their next targets. It will be endless. The president has given into all of their demands, and  they remain insatiable. It’s time we starved the  beast. Then . . .  They came  to Washington  they say committed not to do business as usual. Then they  demanded  that we protect every  loophole,  every billionaire and every greedy element in  our society except those who need some help.  They set-up something that is their fail safe.  I call it the ‘‘Kevorkian Commission’’ that will  deliver  the poison  if  in November, we don’t  volunteer to do it ourselves.  We Democrats in the House were not at the  table, and we wind up on the menu.  There are arguments  that are valid and  good for voting ‘‘aye.’’ But I didn’t come to this  place to forget the homeless, the hapless and  the hungry.  The most vulnerable  in our society don’t  watch their 401K plan, the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the futures market. Their future is getting through till tomorrow. They are  more concerned about having a roof than they  are the national debt ceiling. They need jobs,  nutrition, education and encouragement. The  time we’ve spent on this debate would indicate  that we’ve bought into the trickledown theory.  Here’s what I know: the people I came here  to help need real help. Their lives and future  are really endangered. What happens  to us  people with portfolios, and Wall Street watchers is scary, but conjecture.  Sounds hokey, but  I’m voting  came here to do.  for what  I  f  PROCLAMATION  HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR.  OFGEORGIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 2, 2011  ",2011

1544,107,2011-08-02,Mr. HALL.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor  a wonderful  couple  from Denison,  Texas, and outstanding community leaders—  Lacy and Dorothy Harber. I have known Lacy  and Dorothy Harber for many years and they  are  beloved  and  respected  for  their  outstanding philanthropic work, generous spirit,  and many contributions  to  their community.  Knowing people like Lacy and Dorothy—and  gratitude for their close friendship—is a great  part of the benefits I receive as a Member of  Congress.  This year  the Harbers were awarded  the  Ellis Island Medal of Honor, presented by the  National Ethnic Coalition  of Organizations.  Each year, NECO honors ‘‘remarkable Americans who exemplify outstanding qualities  in  both  their personal and professional  lives,  while continuing  to preserve  the richness of  their particular heritage . . . creating a better  world for all of us in the future by the work  they do today.’’  The Harbers are in good company, joining  past winners of  the Ellis  Island Medal of  Honor,  including Presidents George H.W.  Bush and Gerald Ford, Rosa Parks, and Bob  Hope.  The couple’s desire to help others springs  from Lacy’s humble beginnings. His father was  a city bus driver and his mother cooked in a  school lunch room. With four children in the  family, Lacy, at the age of seven, began selling popcorn at baseball games.  From an early age, Lacy also suffered from  severe scoliosis which,  left untreated, would  have likely prevented him from walking as an  adult. At  the  time,  the Texas Scottish Rite  Hospital in Dallas was developing new treatments for physically challenged children without charging for service. The hospital provided  treatment for Lacy for nine years, and when  he reached high school he was able to take  his back brace off and compete on the track  team.  Lacy learned from any early age the value  of hard work and the understanding of what it  means to do without. Through hard work, Lacy  has become one of America’s most successful  entrepreneurs, and the couple has used their  good  fortune  to  improve  the  lives of  those  around them.  Lacy and Dorothy, who have been married  over  fifty years, wholly own  the American  Bank of Texas, but take no profits from the  business. Rather,  the profits go  to charities  and to those less fortunate.

1556,8,2011-09-06,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I rise today  to urge my colleagues to support H.R.  1249, the Leahy-Smith America Invents  Act. Some other responsibilities may  take me from the Senate floor during  this coming week when we will be debating the act and therefore I wanted  to  lay out my views at  this  time,  strongly urging my colleagues to support the bill.  Although the present bill originates  in the House of Representatives, it is  actually based on and is substantially  identical to the bill that passed the  Senate in March by a vote of 95 to 5.  Also, before Chairman SMITH brought  his bill to the House floor, he negotiated final changes to the bill with the  lead supporters of the measure in the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee.  The  House and Senate have now been working on patent reform for 6 years. The  present bill is a good bill. It reflects a  genuine  compromise  between  the  House and the Senate. It is a bill that  will provide substantial benefits to the  U.S. economy in the coming years, so I  hope that, as I said, the Senate will  adopt this legislation and be able to  pass it on directly to the President for  his signature.  The overarching purpose and effect of  the present bill is to create a patent  system that  is clearer,  fairer, more  transparent, and more objective. It is a  system that will ultimately reduce litigation costs and reduce the need to  hire patent lawyers. The bill will make  it simpler and easier to obtain valid  patents and to enforce those patents,  and it will cure some very clear litigation abuses that have arisen under the  current rules, abuses that have done  serious harm to American businesses.  By adopting the first-to-file system,  for example, the bill creates a rule that  is clear and easy to comply with and  that avoids the need for expensive discovery and litigation over what a patent’s priority date is. By adopting a  simple definition of the term  ‘‘prior  art,’’ the bill will make it easier to assess whether a patent  is valid and  cheaper for an inventor to enforce his  patent. By recognizing a limited prior  user right, the bill creates a powerful  incentive  for manufacturers to build  factories and create jobs in this country. By allowing post-grant review of  patents, especially low quality, business method patents, the bill creates  an inexpensive substitute for district  court litigation and allows key issues  to be addressed by experts in the field.  By eliminating  the  recent  surge of  false-marking litigation, the bill effectively repeals what amounts to a litigation  tax  on American manufacturing.  Let me take a few moments to describe how the provisions of this bill  will provide concrete benefits to American inventors, both large and small,  and to the American manufacturing  economy. First, prior commercial use  defense.  A new provision of the present bill  that was added by the House of Representatives will provide important advantages to U.S. manufacturers. Section 5 of the bill creates a new defense  to patent infringement of prior commercial use. This new defense will ensure that the first inventor of a new  process, or of a product used in a manufacturing process, can continue to use  the invention in a commercial process  even if a subsequent inventor later patents the idea. For many manufacturing  processes the patent system presents a  Catch-22. If the manufacturer patents  the process, he effectively discloses it  to the world. But patents for processes  that are used in closed factories are  difficult to police. It is all but impossible to know if someone in a factory in  China, for example, is infringing such a  patent. As a result, unscrupulous foreign and domestic inventors will simply use the invention in secret without  paying licensing fees. Patenting such  manufacturing  processes  effectively  amounts to giving away the invention  to foreign manufacturers.  On the other hand, if the U.S. manufacturer does not patent the process, a  subsequent party may obtain a patent  on it and the U.S. manufacturer will be  forced to stop using a process that he  was the first to invent and which he  has been using for years.  The prior commercial use defense  provides relief to U.S. manufacturers  from this Catch-22, allowing them to  continue to use a manufacturing process without having to give it away to  competitors or running the risk that it  will be patented out from under them.  To establish a right to this defense,  however, the America Invents Act requires  the manufacturer  to use  the  process in the United States. As a result, the AIA creates a powerful incentive for manufacturers to build their  factories  and  plants  in  the United  States. Currently, most foreign countries recognize some prior user rights  that encourage manufacturers to build  facilities in those countries. This bill  corrects this imbalance and creates a  strong incentive for businesses to create manufacturing jobs in this country.  Second,  something  called  supplemental examination. A provision of  this bill that will particularly benefit  small and startup investors is section  12, which authorizes supplemental examination of patents. It is one of the  reasons the bill has such strong support in the small business community.  Currently, even minor and inadvertent  errors in the patent application process  can lead to expensive and very unpredictable and very inequitable conduct  litigation.  It  is often the case that  startup companies or university  researchers cannot afford  to hire  the  very best patent lawyers. Their patents  are prosecuted by an in-house attorney  who does a good enough job but who is  unfamiliar with all of the sharp corners  and pitfalls of the inequitable conduct  doctrine, such as the need to present  cumulative  studies  and  prior  art.  Later, when more legally sophisticated  investors evaluate the patent for potential investment or purchase, these  minor flaws in prosecution can deter  the investor from purchasing or funding the development of the invention.  An investor would not risk spending  hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a product if a potential inequitable conduct attack may wipe out the  whole investment.  Parties on both sides of these exchanges report that investors routinely  walk away from inventions because of  their inability under current law to resolve uncertainties whether a flaw in  prosecution was,  in  fact,  inequitable  conduct. These decisions not to invest  in a new invention represent important  new cures never tested and brought to  market and other important inventions  that are never developed.  The America Invents Act provides a  solution to this problem by authorizing  supplemental examination of patents.  This new proceeding will allow inventors or patent purchasers to return to  the Patent Office with additional material and have the Patent Office reevaluate the patent in light of that material. If the patent is invalid in light  of the new material, the Patent Office  will cancel the claims. But if the office  finds that the patent is valid, the parties will have a patent that they can be  legally certain will be upheld and enforced. The authorization of  supplemental  examination will  result  in  path-breaking inventions being developed and brought to market that otherwise would have lingered on the shelf  because of legal uncertainty over the  patent. It will ensure that small and  startup companies with important and  valid patents will not be denied investment capital because of  legal  technicalities.  Let me talk about what I think is undoubtedly the most important among  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:22 Jun 08, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\SEPT\S06SE1.REC S06SE1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

Three  years  into  President  Obama’s administration, we have yet  to confirm 100 judges.

1560,15,2011-09-06,Mr. LEAHY.," The Senate  is  today  turning  its  attention  back  to  the  America Invents Act—a measure that  will help create jobs, energize the economy and promote innovation without  adding a penny to the deficit. This legislation is a key component of both  Democratic and Republican jobs agendas, and is a priority of the Obama administration.  Too often in recent years, good legislation has failed in the Senate because  bills have  become  politicized. That  should not be the case with patent reform. Innovation and economic development are not uniquely Democratic or  Republican objectives—they are American goals. That is why so many Democratic and Republican Senators have  worked closely on this legislation for  years, along with a similar bipartisan  coalition of House Members.  And that is why a Democratic chairman of  the Senate Judiciary Committee can stand on the floor of the  Senate and advocate, as I do today,  that the Senate pass a House bill, H.R.  1249,  sponsored  by  the Republican  chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, LAMAR of Texas. As  Chairman SMITH and I wrote earlier  this year in a joint editorial, ‘‘Patent  reform unleashes American innovation,  allowing patent holders to capitalize  on their inventions and create products  and jobs.’’  This bill, which passed the House  with more than 300 votes, will make  crucial improvements to our outdated  patent  system. These  improvements  can be divided  into three  important  categories that are particularly noteworthy.  First, the bill will speed the time it  takes for applications on true inventions to issue as high quality patents,  which can then be commercialized and  SMITH E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o used to create jobs. There are nearly  700,000 applications pending at the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) that  have yet to receive any action by the  PTO. The Director of the PTO often  says that the next great invention that  will drive our economic growth is likely sitting in that backlog of applications.  The America Invents Act will ensure  that the PTO has the resources it needs  to work through its backlog of applications more quickly. The bill accomplishes this objective by authorizing  the PTO to set its fees and creates a  PTO reserve fund for any fees collected  above the appropriated amounts in a  given year—so that only the PTO will  have access to these fees.  Importantly, the bill also provides  immediate tools the PTO needs to fast  track applications, and continues discounts for fast tracked applications requested by small business, as well as  for applications involving technologies  important to the Nation’s economy or  national  competitiveness,  thanks  to  amendments offered in the Senate by  Senators BENNETANDMENENDEZ.  Second, the America Invents Act will  improve the quality of both new patents issued by the PTO, as well as existing patents. High quality patents  incentivize  inventors  and  entrepreneurs by providing a limited monopoly over the  invention. Low quality  patents, conversely, can impede innovation if the product or process already  exists.  The bill makes  commonsense  improvements to the system by allowing,  for example, third parties to comment  on pending applications so that patent  examiners will have more and better  information readily available. The bill  also implements a National Academy  of Sciences recommendation by creating a postgrant review process to  weed out recently issued patents that  should not have been issued in the first  place.  The bill will also improve upon the  current system for challenging the validity of a patent at the PTO. The current inter partes reexamination process has been criticized for being too  easy to initiate and used to harass legitimate patent owners, while being  too lengthy and unwieldy to actually  serve as an alternative to  litigation  when users are confronted with patents  of dubious validity.  Third, the America Invents Act will  transition  our  patent  filing  system  from a  first-to-invent system to the  more  objective  first-inventor-to-file  system, used throughout the rest of the  world, while retaining the important  grace period that will protect universities  and  small  inventors,  in  particular. As business competition has  gone global, and inventors are increasingly filing applications in the United  States and other countries for protection of their inventions, our current  system puts American inventors and  businesses at a disadvantage.  The differences cause confusion and  inefficiencies for American companies  l a e n b j VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:22 Jun 08, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\SEPT\S06SE1.REC S06SE1         ",2011
1561,22,2011-09-06,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  today I celebrate the 225th anniversary  of  the  incorporation of  the city of  Charles Town, WV. Charles Town has a  rich history and heritage of great significance not only to West Virginia but  to the entire nation.  Charles Town was originally founded  in 1786 in what was then Virginia. The  city was named after Charles Washington, the brother of our first President,  George  Washington.  Charles  Washington moved to the lower Shenandoah Valley  in 1780 and there he  began building his home known as  ‘‘Happy Retreat.’’ In 1786, he asked the  Virginia State Legislature for permission to incorporate a town there, which  he  named  ‘‘Charles  Town.’’  After  Charles Washington’s death, Charles  Town became the county seat of newly  formed Jefferson County.  Our Nation’s focus turned to Charles  Town in 1859 with the trial and execution of abolitionist John Brown and his  followers after their historic raid on  Harper’s Ferry. The trial proceedings,  and the words uttered by John Brown  in Charles Town on the institution that  held millions of Americans in bondage,  helped shape our Nation’s debate on  issues surrounding the Civil War. When  Virginia  seceded  from  the  Union,  Charles Town became part of the newly  created State known as West Virginia.  Today, visitors come to Charles Town  from all over to view an area steeped in  the history of our Nation.  Charles Town has undergone many  changes  over  225 years. And  those  many changes are evident in its abundance of historic sites, including its architectural  landmarks and museums,  and transitions over time in its local  economy. The  residents  of Charles  Town have always met these changes  with courage and vision, and have confronted challenges with resilience and  strength of spirit. They are proud and  hard-working,  and will  undoubtedly  help carry the city into a promising future.  The city’s  local  leaders—both past  and present—also deserve credit for the  city’s success. Their leadership and inspiration have guided Charles Town as  it has developed and grown, while remaining true to its heritage and our  West Virginia values.  I  join Mayor  Peggy Smith and the city council in  celebrating this momentous occasion.  Two hundred twenty-five years ago,  Charles Washington had a vision for  the city of Charles Town and the people of the  lower Shenandoah Valley  who would establish their lives there.  And, as the citizens and  leaders of  Charles Town  look ahead,  I believe  strongly that the city continues to  hold great promise for a prosperous future.∑  f  BILLINGS BIG SKY ALL-STARS  ∑",2011
1562,22,2011-09-06,Mr. TESTER.," Mr. President, I wish  to share some exciting news from my  home State of Montana. As many already know, the Little League World  Series reached its thrilling completion  last month. Montana’s team, the Big  Sky All-Stars from Billings, played in  the U.S. Championship Game after a  breathtaking,  extra-inning  victory  over California in its previous game.  This Billings team was the first team  from Montana  to  reach  the Little  League World Series. Only eight teams  from the thousands of Little Leagues  across  the country make  it  to  the  World Series held in South Williamsport, PA, each year. One of our boys,  Ian Leatherberry, originally said that  the team was just hoping to play in the  regional  tournament.  Instead,  they  played so long that they had a good excuse  for missing  the  first week of  school.  Behind  the  leadership of manager  Gene Carlson and his coaches, these  Treasure State  champs became  the  talk of the tournament and the Nation.  With great pitching, outstanding defense, and timely hitting, they quickly  proved  they  belonged  by  defeating  South Dakota and Louisiana, winning  each game by a thrilling two-run margin.  Despite our State not even having a  million  people, Montana’s All-Stars  didn’t blink when taking on the team  from Huntington Beach, CA,  for the  right to reach the U.S. championship  game. Montana’s starting pitcher Cole  McKenzie battled California’s hitters,  holding  them  scoreless.  Then  Ben  Askelson hit a dramatic walk-off home  run to give our boys an amazing 1–0  win in extra innings.  It is honestly no surprise to me that  the Big Sky All-Stars punched above  their class. Whether competing in Little League baseball or showing the rest  of the world true sportsmanship, Montana knows how to compete.  Despite their  loss  in the national  championship game, Gene and his players earned the respect of all of Montana. These 12 boys—Ben Askelson, Jet  Campbell,  Sean  Jones,  Connor  Kieckbusch,  Pearce  Kurth,  Ian  Leatherberry, Brock MacDonald, Andy  Maehl, Cole McKenzie, Dawson Smith,  Gabe Sulser  and Patrick Zimmer—  played with great skill and determination, making everyone  from the Big  Sky State proud of their immense accomplishment.∑  f  HONORING RAYMOND MEDER  ∑",2011
1563,22,2011-09-06,Mr. TESTER.," Mr. President, today I  honor Raymond Meder and his service  to the Army of the United States during World War Two.  Raymond arrived in Normandy 6 days  after D-day and went on to fight in the  frigid Battle of the Bulge. After that  defining battle, Raymond Meder and  his commanding officer were ordered to  take a jeep full of ammunition to the  front line—in German territory.  A mortar exploded in front of Raymond’s jeep, flipping it over. The crash  shattered Raymond’s wrist and he suffered from shrapnel in his leg. Still  under  heavy  fire, Raymond Meder  crawled to the side of the road and covered his commanding officer with his  own body. Sadly, that officer never  made it. But Raymond returned fire  through the night and into the morning with a machine gun until reinforcements arrived.  In a hospital  in France, Raymond  Meder was visited by an Army captain  who told him, ‘‘You’ll earn medals for  this.’’  Yes, he earned them. But he never received them.  Three weeks  later, Raymond  returned to the battlefield. His wrist was  deformed for the rest of his life. He  never complained. And his military  records were destroyed by a 1973 fire in  St. Louis.  Raymond Meder passed away just a  few months ago, on March 30. His son  Ray and daughter-in-law Corine started asking questions about Raymond’s  service. Last month I had the honor of  presenting  to  his  family Raymond  Meder’s Bronze Star, Combat Infantryman Badge 1st Award, World War Two  Victory Medal and Honorable Service  Lapel Button.  These may be small tokens, but they  are powerful symbols of true heroism,  sacrifice, and dedication to service.

1566,36,2011-09-06,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Mrs.  Jennifer Castelazo, a truly remarkable person  who has been chosen to be the Napa County  Teacher of the Year for 2012.  Mrs. Castelazo has always had a profound  love for teaching and it is clearly visible with  her students. She has been teaching Chemistry, Honors Chemistry, and Advanced Placement Chemistry at Vintage High School since  1998.  Born in Massachusetts but raised in Livermore, California,  she  obtained  an  undergraduate degree in microbiology and her Master’s of Science in food science and nutrition  at California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo. She  is a credentialed teacher in Physical and Life  Science.  Throughout  her  teaching  career,  Mrs.  Castelazo has volunteered for leadership positions on her campus, including twice participating on Western Association of Schools and  Colleges leadership teams and serving as the  9th grade House lead teacher. She has supported student enrichment activities, serving  as advisor to the Adventure Club, the GREEN  Club, and senior class. Mrs. Castelazo has  also led student sports, coaching Junior Varsity Girls’ Soccer, Boys’ Varsity Tennis and  teaching  the  foreign exchange student summer program physical education course.  Mrs. Castelazo has been married  for 15  years to Mark Castelazo. She is the mother of  12-year-old Maddie, 9-year-old Connor, and 7-  year-old Ethan, and  is often seen coaching  her daughter’s soccer games on Saturday  mornings.  Mrs. Castelazo makes herself available  to  all students to ensure they are achieving their  highest potential and works to ignite a passion  for the sciences. She is a natural teacher and  a leader among her peers. It is therefore appropriate that we honor her at this time for her  service to Napa students and the community.

1567,3,2011-09-15,Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, I have a great idea. Let’s pass  the American Jobs Act.  It cuts taxes, it invests in infrastructure, and most importantly, it helps  small businesses be more competitive  in the global economy. Economists of  all political stripes tell us that this act  will create 1.9 million jobs, and it does  it, in part, by making sure that U.S.  taxpayer dollars are spent on U.S. jobs  by applying the Buy American provisions.  We should pass the American Jobs  Act, and then we should take the simple  idea  that U.S.  taxpayer dollars  should go to create U.S. jobs and then  apply it to every corner of the Federal  Government. For  instance, we could  create another 600,000 jobs on top of the  1.9 million if we’d just clean up loopholes that allow for thousands of defense contracts to go to overseas companies.  You see, rhetoric on the floor of the  House of Representatives doesn’t create jobs. Real, now-focused policies do,  like the American Jobs Act and the  Buy American policy.  f  U.S. OBJECTION TO PALESTINIAN  STATEHOOD IN THE U.N.—A HOLLOW, LONE VOICE OF REASON  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2011
1568,3,2011-09-15,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, the  Palestinians are going to the United  Nations to seek some type of recognition as a state, but this decision should  only be decided with direct negotiations with Israel and Palestine. The  Palestinians have rejected this proper  process for peace and go instead to the  anti-Israel U.N. for recognition.  Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the U.N., said: ‘‘If there was a  U.N. resolution whose first clause was  anti-Israel and whose  second clause  was that the Earth was flat, the U.N.  would pass it.’’  The U.S. has come to this issue late,  and even though it will object to the  Palestinian  statehood  through  the  U.N., in recent years, the United States  has given mixed signals about its support  for Israel. That  is unfortunate.  Israel is our most loyal friend and ally  in the Middle East.  The U.S. objection to the Palestinian  statehood in the U.N. will be a hollow,  lone voice of reason. It will show once  again that the U.S. has little leadership in the United Nations. However,  the U.N. will reaffirm its position of  bigotry against all things Israel even if  it means proclaiming the Earth is flat.  This is yet another reason to cut U.S.  aid to the U.N. We don’t need to pay  the U.N. to hate Israel. They will do it  for free.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  PASS THE JOBS ACT  (Mrs. CHRISTENSEN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2011
1569,3,2011-09-15,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," I am very worried about our country. Democrats and  our President are calling on the Congress to pass the Jobs Act so that our  fellow Americans who have been unemployed can go back to work; so that  teachers, firemen, and police can keep  their jobs; so that those whose incomes  have dropped will have a little more  money to spend on their families; so  that our children will have  schools  that show we care about them; and so  that struggling small businesses will  get the help they need.  Building the political will to do this  requires not only patriotism;  it  requires compassion. After watching the  Tea Party debate, where the audience  and some candidates indicated an uninsured person should be left to die and  where there was loud applause for capital punishment, I wonder if we can  still feel another’s pain.  This calls out to the good people that  I know who remain the majority in  this country to do more, to speak louder to drown out the voice of hate, and  to renew and strengthen the values  that have always made  the United  States of America the greatest country  in the world.  We are commanded to love our neighbor. As my pastor preached last Sunday, if we do, we will not wish our  neighbors ill or do them harm.  f  PROVIDING  FOR  CONSIDERATION  OF H.R. 2587, PROTECTING JOBS  FROM  GOVERNMENT  INTERFERENCE ACT  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker,  by  direction  of  the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 372 and ask for its immediate  consideration.  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:  H. RES. 372  Resolved, That upon the adoption of this  resolution it shall be in order to consider in  the House the bill (H.R. 2587) to prohibit the  National Labor Relations Board from ordering any employer to close, relocate, or transfer employment under any circumstance. All  points of order against consideration of the  bill are waived. The amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the  Committee on Education and the Workforce  now printed in the bill shall be considered as  adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order against  provisions  in  the  bill,  as  amended,  are  waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, to  final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce; and (2) one motion  to recommit with or without instructions.  ",2011
1570,3,2011-09-15,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," The gentleman from South Carolina is recognized for 1 hour.  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker,  for  the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes  to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. MCGOVERN), pending which I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of  this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.  GENERALLEAVE  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to  revise and extend their remarks.  ",2011
1571,3,2011-09-15,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Is there  objection to the request of the gentleman from South Carolina?  There was no objection.  b0920  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Because the one Republican amendment  submitted to the Rules Committee was  not germane and because the Democrats chose not to offer any amendments at all, House Resolution 372 provides for a closed rule for consideration  of H.R. 2587, the Protecting Jobs from  Government Interference Act.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of this rule and the underlying bill.  The underlying bill would amend the  National Labor Relations Act to prohibit the NLRB from ordering any employer to relocate, shut down or transfer employment beginning the date of  passage. Since  the NLRB  filed  suit  against Boeing, I have been reminded  of an old saying: ‘‘A government that  is big enough to give you all you want  is big enough to take it all away.’’  What you see now is exactly that,  Big Government killing jobs under the  guise of protecting workers. Let me be  clear. Despite what opponents will say,  this is not a union issue. This is a classic example of government overreach  which will, in the end, destroy American jobs and encourage companies to  look elsewhere in the world.  With unemployment at 9.1 percent  and an economy which is best described  as fragile, we do not have the luxury of  being able to afford this action. Plain  and simple, my legislation will remove  the NLRB’s ability to kill jobs.  The  government,  especially  an  unelected board, does not need to be involved in the business decisions of the  private sector. In fact, it cannot be. We  already live in a country where our  corporate tax structure is the second  highest in the world, and we cannot  add another strike against us.  Today, the NLRB’s overreach threatens 1,100 jobs in my hometown of north  Charleston. Let me  say  that again:  1,100  jobs already created and  filled.  Who is to say tomorrow it does not preclude another company from looking to  expand, not just in South Carolina, a  State where our unemployment rate is  at 10.9 percent, but anywhere in the  country. This  instability  is the  last  thing our job creators need right now.  Once again, Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of this rule and the underlying  legislation. This commonsense solution  will help spur job creation and, more  importantly,  it will  remove  impediments to job creation.

1572,10,2011-09-15,Mr. MCGOVERN., Will the gentleman  yield?  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. I yield  to the gentleman from Massachusetts.  ,2011
1573,10,2011-09-15,Mr. MCGOVERN.,"  I’m  just curious.  When are we going to debate a bill on  this floor that helps create jobs? Why  don’t you bring the President’s plan to  the floor and let’s have it out?  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Our  President wants an up-or-down vote on  this one package.  We believe that the fastest and most  effective way to show the American  people that partisan politics  is over  and that we’re now  focused on the  American people, we will take those  parts, those aspects of the President’s  bill that we agree with, like regulatory  reform like we’re doing today, and simply say to the American people that  we’re listening. We will take, without  any question, an opportunity to debate  the necessity of reducing the corporate  tax structure to make America’s corporations more competitive.  Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope we can  move past the politics and the games  which  so often  sidetrack  things  in  Washington and pass this  important  legislation here today.  This is not a question of pro-union—  I agree with you—or anti-union. It is a  question of right versus wrong.  The NLRB has plenty of tools at its  disposal to protect workers and hold  employers  accountable  for  unlawful  labor practices. There is simply no reason it should have the power to dictate  where a private business can establish  its workforce.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time, and I move the previous  question on the resolution.  b1020  ",2011

1576,17,2011-09-15,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 15 seconds.  The gentleman  from Virginia  just  said that this bill restrains companies  from growing jobs. Here’s what it restrains. It restrains from saying to a  worker who dares to stand up and bargain for themselves and fight for themselves, ‘‘You’re fired.’’ That’s what it  restrains; and it should restrain that,  because that’s our law.  Mr. Speaker,  at  this  time  I  am  pleased to yield 11⁄2minutes to one of  the most passionate voices for working  Americans  in the modern history of  this country, my friend from Ohio (Mr.  KUCINICH).  ",2011
1577,17,2011-09-15,Mr. KUCINICH.," The National Labor  Relations Act was a New Deal initiative which helped save American capitalism by creating a process which  would protect the rights of employees  and  employers.  This  was  before  NAFTA, GATT, and the WTO, which  tore  legal rights  for workers apart,  moved millions of jobs out of the U.S.  Yes, we stand for the workers at Boeing in Washington State, but we also  stand  for the workers at Boeing  in  South Carolina, because they will have  no recourse if Boeing wants to move  jobs to China.  You can’t say you want to create jobs  here at home while destroying  the  rights of workers to organize, the right  to  collective  bargaining. These  are  basic rights in a democratic society.  You can’t say you want to protect  American jobs and not protect American workers. Take  away workers’  rights to free speech, take away workers’ right to due process and you create  a new class of slave laborers here in the  United States who are helpless to stop  the movement of jobs out of America.  This  bill  not  only  sacrifices  the  rights of Boeing workers  in Washington State,  it also sacrifices  laws  that are designed to protect workers’  rights. It’s an attack on all American  workers.  It’s one thing to take the side of the  boss or the owners; it’s another thing  to take the side of the boss or the owners when they want to move jobs out of  America.  Stand up for the American workers,  stand up for workers’ rights, stand up  for American jobs, and stand up for employers who want to keep jobs in the  United States.  ",2011
1578,17,2011-09-15,Mr. KLINE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes  to another member of  the  committee, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON).  ",2011
1579,17,2011-09-15,Mr.  BUCSHON.,"  you, Mr.  Thank  KLINE.  Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to talk  about jobs. The first thing I want to do  is correct this ridiculous notion that  this bill causes jobs to go overseas. I  would argue it does just the opposite.  Just like Dr. ROE, I grew up in a  union household. My  father was  a  United Mine Worker, and that’s why I  am here today. I was elected to Congress to protect all workers, not just a  select few.  Ninety-three  percent  of American  workers are not in a union; 7 percent  are, in the private sector. The National  Labor Relations Board complaint is an  attack on American job creators.  Again, I was elected to protect all  workers, not just a select few.  The NLRB’s decision to punish Boeing for creating 1,100 new jobs is just  another example of the administration  abusing its position to advance a biased agenda. I want to remind everyone  no jobs were taken from Washington  State.  This  is a straightforward bill that  prohibits the NLRB from ordering an  employer to close, relocate, or transfer  employment under any circumstances.  This bill will create an environment  necessary  for  employers  to  develop  their businesses in the State that offers the best opportunity—and, I would  argue, in the best country that offers  the best opportunity—to grow and create jobs and not have this left up to a  board  of  unelected  bureaucrats  in  Washington, D.C.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and  let’s get America back to  work.  ",2011
1580,17,2011-09-15,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to yield 11⁄2minutes to a daughter and sister in a union family who  doesn’t forget where she came from,  the gentlelady from New York (Mrs.  MCCARTHY).  I  Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York.  thank my colleague.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 2587, a bill I call the ‘‘Outsourcing Bill of Rights.’’  Especially during these difficult economic times, we have come together to  do the patriotic thing—protect and create jobs here at home.  This  legislation  eliminates  the  NLRB’s already limited authority to  order an employer  to  restore work  taken away in a wrongful way. By passing this bill, we are telling our Nation’s workers we cannot and we will  not help them. Plain and simple, if this  bill passes, it will lead to increased  outsourcing of jobs. Further, the bill  will make certain that employers will  not be held accountable.  My colleague on the other side just  mentioned that 93 percent of American  workers are not unionized, and I also  would like to bring up the point that  we have seen wages across this country  going down and yet we have seen the  profits in corporations going up. That’s  why we are in the situation we are in  right now.  I come from a union family, and I am  proud of that. It was able to give us the  education that we needed, for my father and mother to be able to buy us a  home. That, we’re not seeing today.  Why? Because we’re hitting the workers. Why did we have unions in the first  place? To give them a voice.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this  bill. In my opinion, the corporations  should be a little bit more patriotic  and start hiring people so we can get  this economy going and make  this  great country what we are. America  can go forward, but not without good  pay for our workers.  ",2011
1581,17,2011-09-15,Mr. KLINE.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  pleased to yield 3 minutes to another  member of the committee, the gentleman  from  South  Carolina  (Mr.  GOWDY).  ",2011
1582,17,2011-09-15,Mr. GOWDY.," I want to thank the  chairman  for his  leadership on this  issue and so many others on the Education and Workforce Committee.  Mr. Speaker, the NLRA is supposed  to balance the rights of employees, employers, and the general public, but  you would never know that from the  recent  actions  of  the NLRB. This  unelected group of executive branch recess appointees has abandoned all pretense of objectivity and has become,  frankly, nothing more than a taxpayer-  funded law firm for Big Labor.  Boeing is the most glaring example  of their overreach, but it is not the  only one. At a time when union membership is at a historic low, the NLRB  seeks to give Big Labor a historically  high level of influence with this administration, whether  it’s quickie elections or mandating advocacy posters in  the workplace or this, the economic  death penalty. The NLRB is out of control and it needs to be reined in so it  does not do even more damage to this  fragile economy.  With respect to the bill at hand in  which my  friend and colleague Mr.  SCOTTseeks to remove a single remedy  from the arsenal of the NLRB, leaving  a dozen other remedies, this bill simply  says that you cannot force Boeing to  close a billion-dollar facility, which is  already being constructed in Charleston, and fire the thousand workers who  have been hired and send the work  back to Washington State, which  is  tantamount  to  the  economic  death  penalty. Not a single worker has lost a  job or a benefit in Washington State,  Mr. Speaker, when Boeing started this  separate, distinct supply line.  The NLRB thinks a company should  stay in a union State no matter how  many work stoppages there are, no  matter  how many  customers  have  threatened  to go do business  somewhere else because they can’t get their  planes on time, no matter how many  fines have been paid because of late delivery of airplanes because of work  stoppages, no matter what. No matter  how much money is lost, Mr. Speaker,  the NLRB thinks that Boeing should  have to stay in a union State because  it planted a flag originally in a union  State.  This Congress has limited civil remedies when they have been abused. This  Congress has limited criminal remedies  whether they have been abused. And  this Congress must limit administrative  remedies when  they are being  abused, as they are now. Even the Chicago Tribune, Mr. Speaker, hardly a  bastion of conservative thought, acknowledges that the NLRB is out of  control.

1593,52,2011-09-15,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, Malcolm  Wallop of Wyoming  is a man with  whom I served in the Senate for approximately 10 years. He represented  the State of Wyoming. During that  time, I can remember the work he and  Alan  Simpson  did  together—Alan  Simpson, another retired Senator from  Wyoming. Senator Wallop died yesterday. He was 78 years old.  Senator Wallop was a fine man. His  roots in Wyoming stem back to pioneer  ancestors in the Big Horn. Although he  was born in New York, he served his  country admirably  in the Army and  then worked for many years as a cattle  rancher and businessman before running for office. He was extremely good  friends with the great Nevadan Paul  Laxalt.  There were occasions when Malcolm  and I didn’t agree on political issues,  but he was always an agreeable man, a  very  fine man.  I honor his  service  today, both as a soldier and a Senator,  and certainly will miss him, as everyone in Wyoming will and all of his colleagues who worked with him here in  the Senate.  HISPANICHERITAGEMONTH  ",2011
1594,52,2011-09-15,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, in my office  right across the hall, I have a wonderful picture painted by a Nevadan. It is  a big painting, and it shows this handsome young man on this horse with all  the trappings of a horse that is really  nice, a nice horse and a beautiful saddle, and all the adornments on this  man’s clothes are good. I am sure the  painting didn’t take into consideration  how he really looked when he arrived  in the Las Vegas Valley because this  man, Rafael Rivera, was the first non-  Indian to see the Las Vegas Valley, and  I am sure he was worn out and tired because he was basically  lost. He was  part of a Spanish expedition, and he  left them almost 100 miles from where  he wound up in Las Vegas. But for us,  Rafael Rivera is the person who founded Las Vegas. He was able to see this  beautiful place in 1829, and as a result  of that, we have a number of facilities  named after Rafael Rivera, as well they  should be, in Las Vegas Valley.  The picture is painted perfectly. It  shows  Las Vegas Valley’s  Sunrise  Mountain. The difference is, there are  no people there. Now there are 3 million people in Nevada, and we have little Sunrise Mountain  there.  In  the  painting, there is no one or anything  around it, but of course now there are  buildings and hotels and lots of activity there.  Today, though, Mr. President, I join  more than 50 million Hispanic Americans in the United States in marking  the  first  day  of Hispanic Heritage  Month. This celebration of history and  culture lasts through October 15. So I  look  forward  to  the opportunity of  bringing Hispanic heritage and all it  has to Nevada and the rest of the country to honor the contributions of a population that is such an integral part of  our national identity. For hundreds of  years, Latinos have helped shape the  face of this Nation.  I wrote a history of my birthplace,  Searchlight, NV, and one of the interesting things I found in my research is  that the railroad was built into Searchlight in the early 1900s, it is 26 miles,  and it was a difficult railroad to build,  but it was basically built by Mexicans  who had come to the United States to  do the labor that it took to do that.  Some 7,000 of them built that railroad.  It is not very long—26 miles long—but  it took a lot of work to get it done.  So everyplace you go in America, everyplace especially you go in the West,  you find contributions made by Hispanics. They have made contributions  in the battlefield,  in the workplace,  and the classroom. They have spurred  progress  in  the  laboratory,  playing  field in all athletics, and, of course, in  the halls of justice. They have shaped  the way we farm and the way we do  business. They have influenced our art  and our literature. Construction sites  of casinos and shopping centers around  the State of Nevada—they have contributed mightily to that work that is  being done and has been done.  The language has even influenced the  name of the State of Nevada, which  means  ‘‘snow  covered.’’ Las Vegas  means ‘‘the meadows’’ in Spanish.  Hispanic Americans have also played  an  important  role  in  this Nation’s  Armed Forces, as I mentioned just a  minute ago. They have served in every  conflict since the Revolutionary War.  Nearly 30,000 of them have fought for  our country in Iraq and Afghanistan  and are still fighting. I thank them for  their brave and dedicated service.  Every year, Latinos help propel contributions to our economy. More than  2.3 million Hispanic-owned businesses  employ millions of Americans and provide crucial goods and services.  Mr. President, before leaving the subject of veterans and the good things  they do, I want to make sure the Republican leader recognizes that we all  celebrate a Kentuckian who today is  going  to be awarded  the Medal of  Honor, for this 23-year-old boy, in the  fields of Afghanistan, saved the lives of  about 40 soldiers—1 person. They had a  wonderful piece on public broadcast  today about his courage and what he  did—of course wounded himself, but he  carried people to and from battle and  saved the lives, as I indicated, of a couple score of people. His name is Dakota  Meyer. So I congratulate the Republican leader for having such fine people  come from the State of Kentucky.  Today,  the Senate  recognizes  the  commitment of more than 50 million  Hispanic Americans,  family, community, and country. And that is the way  it should be.  FEMA  ",2011
1595,52,2011-09-15,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I want to  spread on the record how much I appreciate the support of the Republicans in  allowing us to be able to get on the  FEMA bill. We are on that bill now. We  have some amendments pending. If we  are not able to work out an agreement  on that today, we will have votes on a  number of cloture  issues relating to  that most important legislation affecting millions of Americans who have  been devastated by Mother Nature.  I am disappointed, however, in one of  our Republican colleagues who at this  stage is holding up something that is  so vitally necessary.  The House sent us two pieces of legislation that passed overwhelmingly in  the House, one that will keep 1.7 or 1.8  million people working on highway and  other construction around the country  dealing with highways. That is an extension of 6 months. They also sent to  us a 4-month extension, fully funded, of  the Federal Aviation Administration,  also vitally important.  Unless my friend, the junior Senator  from Oklahoma, agrees to allow us to  go forward, one Senator will stop 80,000  people from working. I hope he will reconsider. The issue he has presented is  a little unusual. He says he doesn’t like  bike paths being part of the highway  bill. Well, for most Americans they are  absolutely important. They are good  for purposes of allowing people to travel without burning all the fossil fuel on  the highways.  I got up this morning very early, and  I went out and did my exercise. I am  not exaggerating, there were scores, at  least 30 or 40 bikes—so scores may be a  slight exaggeration—of people not just  for exercise but traveling to work with  backpacks on. That is what bike paths  are all about.  We have told my friend the Senator  from Oklahoma: If you don’t like it, we  will have a vote on it.  He said: I don’t want a vote.  He said: Whatever I want, I want  stuck in that bill.  We can’t do that. That isn’t what the  House sent us, and we can’t do that.  He said: Well, separate the two bills.  We have the bills from the House of  Representatives. That is the arrangement we have made, and it is a good arrangement to get these two vitally important pieces of legislation passed so  that we can keep people—almost 2 million people—working.  I am disappointed in that. I hope we  can work something out during the day  because it is really unfair for him to  hold up this extremely important legislation.  There is not a State in the Union  that does not have problems with 80,000  people laid off. In Nevada we have a  new  tower being built at McCarran  Field. That is important. These people  will have  to  stop working. That  is  wrong. One Senator? It is not fair to  the Senate or to the country.  Will the Chair announce the business  of the day?

1596,73,2011-09-15,Mr. JOHANNS.," I rise today to actually extend an invitation. The invitation I extend is to our EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson. The reason for  the invitation is very straightforward.  There is a lot of confusion about EPA’s  position on regulating farm dust. It is  remarkable. The Administrator  says  one thing, but then the agency takes a  different  position—back  and  forth,  back and forth it has gone.  Administrator Jackson said, and  I  am using her words, ‘‘It is a myth that  EPA  is proposing  to  regulate  farm  dust.’’ That seems pretty clear, but  then her agency says: Well, no, we cannot distinguish between farm dust and  other dust subject to regulation, so  rural America is not off the hook, it is  out of luck.  Well, I was very pleased recently to  offer a solution to this EPA dilemma.  My solution was offered in partnership  with my  friend and colleague  from  Iowa, Senator CHUCKGRASSLEY, and  others actually from both sides of the  aisle. We proposed a simple solution to  this confusion. We proposed legislation  that—very straightforward—says: EPA  cannot regulate farm dust unless there  is scientific proof that it causes harm.  That proof does not  exist  today.  Meanwhile, Ms. Jackson and her agency continue to have problems getting  this story straight. You see, she scoffs  at the idea of regulating farm dust, and  then her agency turns around and says:  Well, it is really a possibility.  I understand that sometimes the direction from the top can get muddled  as it works its way down. After all,  EPA is a very large organization.  Surely, Administrator Jackson does  not intend to be saying one thing while  her agency is saying and potentially  doing something quite different. So I  am hopeful I have come up with yet another solution.  Today, Senator GRASSLEYand I sent  a letter to Administrator Jackson. We  have invited her to publicly support  our bill blocking the regulation of farm  dust. After all, using her own word,  this was a ‘‘myth’’ in the first place. I  think it is a perfect solution. She says  EPA has no  intention of regulating  farm dust, so there is absolutely no  reason why she would not support this  legislation that makes it official. My  letter invites her to put her words into  action by  issuing a  straightforward  supportive statement. I look forward to  hearing back from her or simply seeing  her statement of support in print. Either will be acceptable.  I will tell you this: I believe if Administrator Jackson stands up in response to this and says, yes, I was serious, we are not going to regulate farm  dust,  that  is a myth, and Senator  has  it all wrong, I believe  rural America will cheer.  Supporting my bill that puts an end  to this crazy, ridiculous notion of regulating farm dust would do more to imJOHANNS prove Administrator Jackson’s image  than the charm offensive EPA has recently undertaken.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2011

1601,73,2011-09-15,Mr. LEVIN.," Madam President, I understand  that a couple of our colleagues are on their way, and I will  yield to them if they get here as expected.  In the meantime,  I wish to share  some thoughts with the Senate about  the very complex and difficult duty we  all now face, which is to agree to legislation that will reduce the deficit by at  least $1.2 billion over the next decade.  And, if we fail to do that, by the end of  the year, huge automatic budgets in  vital national programs, including in  security, will take effect to meet the  deficit  reduction  goal. Those  automatic cuts would take an unacceptable  toll on vital programs. I believe every  Member of Congress must do their best  to avoid that outcome, and that begins  with the 12 members of the Joint Select Committee who have been given  the assignment of crafting a plan for us  to consider.  Despite the difficulty, the task  is  achievable. We can reach our deficit reduction targets and help ensure fiscal  stability while avoiding not only the  damaging  automatic  cuts  but  also  avoiding devastating cuts to defense,  health, education, and other programs  vital to America and to its families.  Achieving this goal will require sacrifices. Everyone is going to have to  contribute. But  if all of us,  every  American, will make the sacrifices necessary, we can get this done.  How can we do it? Well, we could pretend we can resolve this problem by ignoring why we got here to try to balance  the budget by  simply  cutting  more spending or we can take a realistic look at both spending and revenues. We need to take a realistic look  at both spending and revenue. A little  historical perspective might be helpful.  Federal revenues today are at the  lowest share of gross domestic product  in generations, just 14.9 percent. For  the past 60 years, that number has  averaged about 18 percent, and during  that period we have balanced the budget five times, and each time revenues  totaled 19 percent of gross domestic  product or higher.  Past efforts to reduce high deficits  have made new revenue a significant  part of the equation. President Reagan  presided over three deficit reduction  plans that achieved more than three-  quarters  of  their  deficit  reduction  through revenue  increases. That was  President Reagan. Revenue  increases  were a major part of his deficit reduction plan. The deficit reduction legislation that we passed in 1990 under the  first President Bush achieved about  one-third of  its deficit cuts through  added revenue. President Clinton’s 1993  deficit reduction plan was roughly 55  percent new revenue and 45 percent  spending cuts and yielded our most recent balanced budgets.  Apart  from  history,  the mathematical reality simply is that we must  generate additional revenues. If we are  going to reduce the deficit and do so  while avoiding unacceptable cuts to  programs that provide for the common  defense and general welfare, revenue  must be part of the discussion.  Many of our Republican colleagues  have focused solely on nondefense discretionary programs for deficit reduction. The simple fact is those programs  are not big enough to allow real deficit  reduction. They make up only about 12  percent of the Federal budget. If we  eliminated all those programs, zeroed  them out, we would have done grave  harm to millions of American families,  but we still would have huge deficits as  far as the eye can see.  So as the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group, said: For a grand bargain on deficit reduction, finding a way  to bring in some revenue is a crucial  piece of the puzzle.  The nonpartisan Committee for Responsible Federal Budget said that putting the deficit on a downward path requires looking at ways to generate additional revenues.  In the balance of my remarks I set  out  seven different  loopholes which  need to be closed. It is only fair that  these  loopholes be closed. They are  loopholes which cannot be  justified.  They are loopholes which I think almost every American would say should  not be in our Tax Code. If we simply  will change our Tax Code and reform it  and close these loopholes, we can raise  about $1 trillion over 10 years. That is  a huge part of what this Joint Select  Committee is required to do.  We have to protect middle-class families from tax increases. We have to  protect them from losing critically important programs, such as education.  We can do that. I have sent a letter to  the members—including my dear friend  from Massachusetts—of our select committee laying out the seven loopholes  which can, and should, be closed which  will have an equitable  impact. It  is  only fair these loopholes be closed, and  I have laid out including the use of offshore tax havens to avoid paying taxes.  In this letter that went to all the members of this Joint Select Committee, I  have set  forth what these  loopholes  are.

1616,87,2011-09-15,Mr. BENNET.," Mr. President, I went  back to the office and I saw my senior  Senator sitting here at this late hour  and I wanted to come down and keep  him company. So I am glad to be here  with you tonight, proud to be from the  West tonight with two great Senators  from Wyoming remembering Malcolm  Wallop’s service in this body. It was  wonderful to hear their remembrances  of him. I am glad we were here to share  that being from the West.  Similar to the Presiding Officer, I  spent most of August in our beautiful  State—the most beautiful State in the  United States, if I do say so myself—in  townhall meetings, mostly in red parts  of the State, but in red and blue parts  of the State. They do not actually  think of themselves that way, but that  is how Washington would talk about it.  In the townhalls, I always start the  same way. I say: Ask any question you  have. Bring any criticism you have. I  tell them I was an urban school superintendent for almost 4 years, it is impossible to hurt my feelings. It was  beaten out of me a long time ago. Then  we have a conversation.  This  time,  every  single meeting  started with somebody saying: What is  wrong with you guys? Why can’t you  work this out in Washington, DC? We  are struggling in the worst economy we  have had since the Great Depression,  and what we see are a lot of political  games being played back there.  That is the version of the conversation I have heard now for 21⁄2years in  our State.  Then, one of the things we get into at  the very beginning is the fact that this  is not a garden-variety recession that  we are just coming out of. This is the  first time—this last decade, not just  this  recession,  the  last decade—the  first  time  in  this country’s history  when median family income actually  declined instead of going up.  Generation  after  generation  after  generation of Americans saw their income rise. Median  family  income  is  sort of shorthand for middle-class family income in this country. It is the  backbone of this country, and it has  fallen for the first time in a decade, as  the cost of health insurance doubled on  the people who live in Colorado, and  the cost of higher education went up by  60 percent.  People are saying: MICHAEL, I have  been at my job for this whole decade  and I am earning less at the end of the  decade than I was at the beginning of  the decade. My costs of not ‘‘nice to  haves,’’ my costs of critical things to  move my family ahead to create stability for me and my small business—  such as health care, such as higher education—have done nothing but  skyrocket.  I am going to show you some numbers that are pretty scary that came  out this week from the Census Bureau  that reflect, in numbers, what I am  talking about and reflect how profound  the structural issues are that we face  in our economy, structural that do not  fit on the back of a bumper sticker or  a political slogan or during a debate at  night on the television set.  This week’s Wall Street Journal, on  Monday, had an article on the front  page with the headline that reads as  follows:  ‘‘As Middle Class Shrinks,  P&G Aims High and Low.’’ P&G  is  Procter & Gamble. There is not a more  iconic brand in our country’s history  when it comes to the middle class than  Procter & Gamble.  Here are some of the things they  make: Crest toothpaste; Head & Shoulders shampoo; Tide detergent; Pamper’s diapers—I am glad to be out of  those in my house, by the way—Bounty  paper towels; Downy  fabric softener,  Scope mouthwash; Duracell batteries;  Charmin toilet paper; Bounce  fabric  softener—nobody needed  fabric  softener before there was a middle class in  this country, but they make it—Mr.  Clean; Pepto Bismol; Pringles; Swiffer  brooms and dusters—we have that in  our  closet—Old  Spice  deodorant;  Nyquil  cough  syrup; Puffs  tissues;  Ivory soap; Covergirl makeup.  That  is what Procter & Gamble  makes. That is what they sold to the  great middle class in this country for  decades. Here is this article that says  Procter & Gamble aims high and low.  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 12,  2011]  ASMIDDLECLASSSHRINKSP&G AIMSHIGH  ANDLOW  (By Ellen Byron)  For generations, Procter & Gamble Co.’s  growth strategy was focused on developing  household staples for the vast American middle class.  Now, P&G executives  say many of  its  former middle-market shoppers are trading  down to  lower-priced goods—widening the  pools of have and have-not consumers at the  expense of the middle.  That’s forced P&G, which estimates it has  at  least one product  in 98% of American  households,  to  fundamentally change  the  way it develops and sells its goods. For the  first time in 38 years, for example, the company launched a new dish soap in the U.S. at  a bargain price.  P&G’s roll out of Gain dish soap says a lot  about the health of the American middle  class: The world’s largest maker of consumer  products is now betting that the squeeze on  middle America will be long lasting.  ‘‘It’s required us to think differently about  our product portfolio and how to please the  high-end  and  lower-end markets,’’  says  Melanie Healey, group president of P&G’s  North America business.  ‘‘That’s  frankly  where a lot of the growth is happening.’’  In the wake of the worst recession in 50  years, there’s little doubt that the American  middle class—the 40% of households with annual incomes between $50,000 and $140,000 a  year—is in distress. Even before the recession, incomes of American middle-class families weren’t keeping up with inflation, especially with the rising costs of what are considered the essential ingredients of middle-  class life—college education, health care and  housing. In 2009, the income of the median  family, the one smack in the middle of the  middle, was  lower, adjusted  for  inflation,  than in 1998, the Census Bureau says.  The slumping stock market and collapse in  housing prices have also hit middle-class  Americans. At the end of March, Americans  had $6.1 trillion in equity in their houses—  the value of the house minus mortgages—  half the 2006 level, according to the Federal  Reserve. Economist Edward Wolff of New  York University  estimates  that  the net  worth—household assets minus debts—of the  middle fifth of American households grew by  2.4% a year between  2001 and  2007 and  plunged by 26.2% in the following two years.  P&G isn’t the only company adjusting its  business. A wide swath of American companies is convinced that the consumer market  is bifurcating into high and low ends and  eroding in the middle. They have begun to  alter the way they research, develop and  market their products.  Food giant H.J. Heinz Co., for example, is  developing more products at  lower price  ranges. Luxury retailer Saks  Inc.  is bolstering its high-end apparel and accessories  because its wealthiest customers—not those  drawn to entry-level items—are driving the  chain’s growth.  Citigroup calls the phenomenon the ‘‘Consumer Hourglass Theory’’ and since 2009 has  urged investors to focus on companies best  positioned to cater to the highest-income  and lowest-income consumers. It created an  index  of  25  companies,  including Estee  Lauder Cos. and Saks at the top of the hourglass and Family Dollar Stores Inc. and Kellogg Co. at the bottom.

1617,94,2011-09-15,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. President, I  rise to speak today as citizens of Lorain County, OH soon gather to honor  one of their favorite sons, ADM Ernest  Joseph King, an American hero, who  served as commander in chief of the  U.S. Fleet, and Chief of Naval Operations during World War II.  This Sunday, September 18, 2011, Admiral King’s memory will be honored  with  a  Lorain  elementary  school  named  in his honor. An open green  space, in the shape of an anchor, will  be dedicated directly across the street  from the admiral’s birthplace, a home  at  113 Hamilton Avenue  that  still  stands  today. Both  the  elementary  school and the green space will remind  future generations of  the admiral’s  contributions to our country and the  personal  traits  that made  him  an  American hero: tenacity, love of country, fearlessness.  Ernest Joseph King was born in Lorain on November 23, 1878, to Elizabeth  and James Clydesdale King. He was the  older brother to two sisters and two  brothers. Admiral King attended Lorain High School and graduated fourth  in his class from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1901. Still enrolled at the Naval  Academy, he  served  in  the Spanish  American War. In 1905, he married Martha Lankin Edgerton  in Baltimore,  with whom he raised six daughters and  a son. King was known to return to Lorain throughout his  life to visit his  childhood friends.  After his  distinguished  service  in  World War I, in 1927, he became a naval  aviator, and only 6 years later, he was  made chief of  the Bureau of Aeronautics of the U.S. Navy, where he  made patrol bombers an essential naval  arm. He was appointed by President  Franklin D. Roosevelt in World War II  as chief of the U.S. Fleet and Chief of  Naval Operations, taking the post only  2 weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He earned his nickname, Eagle  Eye Ernie, by possessing boundless energy, and being a strict disciplinarian.  He retired from the Navy as a decorated officer, having been awarded 10  medals and 14 Foreign Awards, including  the Navy Distinguished Service  Medal and the National Defense Service Medal. Upon Admiral King’s passing, on June 25, 1956, President Eisenhower remarked:  ‘‘Admiral King carried his heavy responsibility with courage, brilliance and continued devotion  to duty.’’  This weekend, the city of Lorain, the  Black  River  Historical  Society,  Charleston Village  Society,  Lorain  City Schools, along with several members of Admiral King’s family will join  together to honor the  legacy of an  American hero. For  school children  who will attend Admiral King Elementary School, and for all Lorain residents who will pass by his home on  Hamilton Avenue, let us remember the  lessons of Admiral Ernest Joseph King,  that patriotism and service forever anchors the greatness of our Nation.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  TRIBUTE TO SHELLY  FAGENSTROM  ∑",2011
1618,94,2011-09-15,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, today I  recognize Shelly Fagenstrom, an outstanding educator from my home State  of Montana. Shelly is the principal of  East Middle School in Great Falls and  has been recognized by the Montana  Association of Secondary School Principals as the Montana Principal of the  Year for 2011.  Shelly has taught and served as an  administrator in the Great Falls school  system for 38 years; all but 2 of those  have been at the middle school level.  She has been the principal at East Middle School since 2005 and prior to that  served for 6 years as the principal at  Paris Gibson Middle School. This isn’t  the first time Shelly has been honored  for her dedication to her students—in  2010 she was named Educator of the  Year by the Montana Parent Teacher  Association.  In nominating her for these awards,  teachers, staff, students, and parents  have praised Shelly’s work to build a  respectful environment at East Middle  School while creating a personalized  learning environment for each student,  her ability to collaborate and seek innovative  solutions  to complex problems. Shelly has also worked to integrate more technology into the curriculum to help prepare students for  the challenges of the 21st century economy. Shelly says she loves being in  education,  ‘‘because of  the  relationships you build with kids and their  families. I love the energy of middle-  schoolers, you can’t take yourself too  seriously with them.’’  Shelly is also involved in the Great  Falls community volunteering for the  United Way and serving in leadership  positions at Central Christian Church.  This month Shelly will be visiting  Washington, DC, with other award-winning principals when they will be recognized  for  their  hard  work  and  achievement  in  educating  and  preparing our children for the future, and  have the opportunity to share ideas on  how to strengthen our education system.  I congratulate Shelly on being named  the 2011 Montana Principal of the Year  and thank her for her decades of service to the Great Falls school system.  Montana has some of the best teachers,  principals, and school administrators  in the country. I would like to commend all of them for their hard work  and  dedication  in  providing  young  Montanans with a world class education that prepares them for a bright  future.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO MR.

1619,94,2011-09-15,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President,  today I wish to honor the 65th wedding  anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. Virgil Poe,  the parents of my good friend serving  the 2nd District of Texas, Congressman  TEDPOE.  In the summer of 1945, following his  service  in Germany  in  the Second  World War, TSgt Virgil Poe was stationed at the US Army Post in Fort  Hood, TX, re-equipping and preparing  for a possible land invasion of Japan.  At the same time, Miss Dorrace Hill  was serving the local Army hospital as  a volunteer for the Red Cross. On a  Wednesday night during that summer  of 1945, Virgil met Dorrace at a prayer  meeting church service. The next year,  the couple was married on October 16,  1946.  Virgil and Dorrace began their wedded life operating a DX service station  where Virgil pumped gas, sold tires,  and fixed cars. Soon thereafter, they  moved to Abilene, TX, where Virgil enrolled at Abilene Christian University.

1620,101,2011-09-15,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President,  I rise  today in support of the Safeguarding  Disaster Funding Act of 2011, which I  am  introducing along with Senator  BROWN from Massachusetts. This legislation would amend the Congressional  Budget Act and the Budget Control Act  to require the President to provide a  more comprehensive view of disaster  funding in his annual budget request.  Our bill would ensure that the true  cost of disaster assistance is reflected  in the President’s budget, by requiring  that Presidents’  annual  budget  requests  for disaster programs  include  funding  levels equal to the average  amount provided annually over  the  previous ten years, excluding the highest and lowest years, to account for  years with unusually high or low disaster activity.  As disaster funding is already considered ‘‘no-year’’ money, unused monies  would  carry  over  to  support years  where additional  funds are required.  The status quo of Congress providing  emergency appropriations to support  these  efforts,  rather  than  including  reasonable estimates, based on past  disaster activity trends, is fiscally irresponsible. We should be working with  the Administration to  fund the necessary and appropriate activities of the  Federal government, including disaster  assistance. Responsible budgeting  for  disasters is the right thing to do for  the victims of devastation, as the vivid  images of the damage from Hurricane  Irene have reminded us.  Hurricane Irene caused more than 4.5  million homes and businesses along the  East Coast to  lose power,  including  nearly 185,000  in my home State of  Maine, which  suffered  flooding  and  washed out bridges in the Western portion of the state. But now that the  winds and rain have subsided, our cities and towns must rebuild from the  devastation.  With the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s  funding currently  running unnecessarily low, they now  must work on an  ‘‘immediate needs  funding’’  basis, meaning  that  non-  emergency recovery projects are put on  hold. Support of natural disaster recovery should not be stalled by the need  for Emergency Supplemental Appropriations. While we cannot completely  predict the number or nature of natural disasters, we do know that these  events occur and cause massive damage. Policymakers cannot continue to  play with the livelihoods of recovering  Americans; assurances must be made  that  their  recovery  is  facilitated  through current Federal disaster recovery programs.  The Safeguarding Disaster Funding  Act of 2011 will ensure that the President  properly  accounts  for  disaster  spending. By basing  the President’s  budget request for disaster funding on  a ten-year average, and excluding the  highs and the lows, we are assuring  that  funds are neither overextended  nor  falsely underestimated.  In these  hard economic times, Congress must  promote fiscal responsibility while ensuring that those areas struck by disasters are able to access the funds needed  to quickly rebuild.  I hope that my fellow colleagues will  support this bill. In the wake of recent  disasters it is readily apparent that we  must plan better for these events.  By Mr. CASEY:  S. 1565. A bill to establish the National Competition for Community Renewal  to encourage communities  to  adopt innovative strategies and design  principles to programs related to poverty prevention, recovery and response,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.  ",2011
1621,101,2011-09-15,Mr. CASEY.," Mr. President,  today  over 15 percent of Americans live in  poverty  including  22 percent of our  children. 46.2 million Americans and  16.4 million children struggle every day  to survive in a system that is demoralizing and unfortunately does more to  maintain people who live in poverty  than to help them escape. Last year,  2.6 million Americans were added to  the poverty rolls and 8.9 million have  been added since 2007.  This must change. That is why I am  today reintroducing the National Opportunity  and  Community Renewal  Act. This legislation puts forth some  new ideas and will grant waivers to ten  communities so they can test different  approaches to combatting poverty. I  am not saying this is the only path forward or the most suitable path  forward. But we must begin somewhere  and we must take a comprehensive approach. As Robert Kennedy once said  when talking about tackling the poverty problem in our country, we must  ‘‘grab the web whole.’’ Piecemeal approaches won’t work.  I know there are other Senators and  Congressmen along with policy professionals and academics who share my  concern and commitment to reducing  poverty. I invite people to review this  proposal. Let me know what you think  and if you have other ideas to bring  them to the table. It is long past time  to reinstill our national commitment  to the least fortunate.  We must also acknowledge that there  is not one answer to helping people out  of poverty. That is why this legislation  is  important.  It will allow communities to pursue innovative approaches  to problems arising from poverty and  avoids a  ‘‘one size  fits all’’ method.  This  legislation also targets  individuals and mandates the creation of an  individual opportunity plan for every  household.  It also helps address the  root causes of poverty by giving local  communities to design programs that  fit their community and they would  not be restricted by the current law.

1622,115,2011-09-15,Ms. MOORE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Antonio M. ‘‘Tony’’ Pe´rez, recipient of  the 2011 Frank P. Zeidler Public Service  Award. Mr. Pe´rez is a long-time social justice  advocate, mentor, community leader and consummate professional. He currently serves as  secretary-executive director of  the Housing  Authority of  the City of Milwaukee (HACM).  The Frank P. Zeidler Public Service Award acknowledges residents whose efforts most embody the social justice and public service values and vision of former Mayor Zeidler, who  died in 2006 at the age of 93.  Mr. Pe´rez’ body of work has been exemplary. He founded the Milwaukee Community  Service Corps (MCSC), a non-profit vocational  training organization that continues to provide  employment and education to young adults in  Milwaukee.  It was modelled after  the 1930s  Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Mr. Pe´rez  developed a holistic program  that  integrates  education and life skills with on-the-job work  experience  for  low-income 18–23-year-olds.  During his  tenure at MCSC  from 1991  to  2000, more than 900 participants found jobs  and  received more  than $4.5 million  in  income. MCSC serves an average of 100 young  participants per year and has served approximately 2,000 young adults since its inception.  In 1996, Mr. Pe´rez was one of six inspirational youth role models and mentors profiled  on PBS’, ‘‘The Merrow Report: Searching for  Heroes’’.

1623,115,2011-09-15,Mr. GRAVES of Missouri.," Mr. Speaker,  I  proudly pause  to  recognize Austin Salmon.  Austin is a very special young man who has  exemplified  the  finest qualities of citizenship  and leadership by taking an active part in the  Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1376, and earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout.  Austin has been very active with his troop,  participating in many scout activities. Over the  many years Austin has been  involved with  scouting, he has not only earned numerous  merit badges, but also the respect of his family, peers, and community. Most notably, Austin became a brotherhood member of  the  Order of  the Arrow and earned  the rank of  Fire Builder in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, as well  as maintaining a position on the Honor Roll of  Liberty North High School in Liberty, Missouri.  Austin has also contributed to his community  through his Eagle Scout project. Austin built  shelving and renovated the basement of Blue  Ridge Trinity Lutheran Church  in Raytown,  Missouri, a small church long in need of the  renovation.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  commending Austin Salmon  for his accomplishments with  the Boy Scouts of America  and for his efforts put forth in achieving the  highest distinction of Eagle Scout.  f  PHARMACEUTICAL STEWARDSHIP  ACT OF 2011  HON. LOUISE McINTOSH SLAUGHTER  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 15, 2011  ",2011
1624,115,2011-09-15,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of  the Pharmaceutical Stewardship  Act of 2011.  Across  the country, unused and expired  pharmaceuticals are polluting our water ways,  poisoning our children, and putting our public  safety at risk. Americans should have a convenient and safe option when they want to rid  their cabinets of unused drugs. The pharmaceutical stewardship bill  I  introduced  today  would ensure that these drugs are kept out of  drinking water and out of the hands of both  criminals and unsuspecting children.  The need for a safe drug disposal program  has never been greater. In a 2008 investigation, pharmaceutical contamination was found  in 24 out of 28 metropolitan areas’ drinking  water. Over 50 pharmaceuticals or byproducts  were found in the Philadelphia source watershed alone.  Unlike the citizens of approximately a dozen  other countries, Americans do not have a convenient and consistent place  to bring  their  medications. Without a drug  take back program, pharmaceuticals are frequently diverted  to purposes for which they were not intended.  The results can be deadly. Unguarded, unused pharmaceuticals can cause accidental  poisonings, be misused, or diverted for criminal purposes.  Every fifteen minutes, a child under four will  overdose on drugs found at home. In 2011,  the Centers  for Disease Control  (CDC)  reported  that unintentional prescription opioid  overdoses now kill more Americans than cocaine and heroin combined.  In Florida,  the  death rate for prescription drugs increased 84  percent.  Without safe disposal options, our most vulnerable and unsuspecting citizens are in the  bull’s eye of a proliferating pharmaceutical  black market. The elderly are at risk of violent  home break-ins, scams, and death as prescription drug addicts seek to steal their medications.  Drug  thieves  also  target  ‘open  house’  events and ask to use the bathroom in order  to have access to the medicine cabinet. The  problem  is so rampant  that realtors  in Ohio  are given medication lockboxes to store medications during open houses and the National  Association of Realtors recommends hiding all  prescription medications during open houses.  Americans who want to reduce the threat to  their health and safety posed by leftover prescription medications have few options.  Federal agencies from the Office of National  Drug Control Policy to the Drug Enforcement  Agency are encouraging Americans to use secure medicine  take-back programs  to return  drugs for environmentally sound disposal. But  these programs are too few and far between,  and communities are struggling  to provide  them. Because secure  take-back programs  are not widely available,  the FDA currently  recommends that the most toxic and addictive  substances be flushed down the toilet and into  the wastewater system. When take-back programs are not available, federal agencies are  forced to advise that all other unwanted pills  should be mixed with undesirable substances  in an attempt to prevent theft and then thrown  in the trash for delivery to the landfill.  The  current disposal methods are  inadequate and even dangerous. A mother with  Crohn’s disease was prescribed an opioid  patch 100 times stronger than morphine but  she was afraid her plumbing could not handle  the used patch so she threw it away. Her 4-  year old died after  finding and applying  the  patch from the trash.  Furthermore, pharmaceuticals disposed  in  the trash or down the drain reach our nation’s  waterways and our drinking water.  In 2002, the United States Geological Survey found that 80 percent of streams and 93  percent of groundwater was contaminated with  at least one pharmaceutical. In 2008, an investigation found that at least 46 million Americans  are  exposed  to  prescription  drugs  through  their drinking water. Others are exposed when food crops are fertilized with polluted biosolids and absorb pharmaceuticals  through the roots to the plant itself. Perhaps  even more frightening is that the current extent of pharmaceutical pollution  is unknown  and understudied.  Aquatic organisms and  indeed whole ecosystems can never escape this witches brew  of pharmaceuticals. The USGS  recently  reported the widespread sexual disruption in fish  across the United States. Of the many compounds  in  the  pharmaceutical  slurry  that  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:00 Sep 16, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15SE8.006 E15SEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011
1625,122,2011-09-15,Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to proudly recognize the  First Annual Orange County Stand Down to be  held  in Santa Ana, California on September  17–18, 2011. Nationally,  it  is estimated  that  one-third of  the homeless population  in  the  United States are  veterans of  the United  States Armed Forces, many of whom face a  constant battle with the effects of their time in  service to our nation. There are approximately  5,000 veterans residing within the borders of  Orange County that currently experience some  form of homelessness during the year.  This event will create a ‘‘one-stop’’ environment  for  these homeless veterans and  their  families to receive basic social services such  as veterans benefit assistance, mental health  and substance abuse counseling, along with  housing and employment placement assistance. The  first Orange County Stand Down  expects  to serve approximately 400–500 of  the county’s homeless veterans and their families, many of whom have served their country  valiantly  in  theaters of combat ranging  from  World War II to the current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Attendees of the Stand Down  will be able to receive hot showers, new clothing, hot meals and a chance to bond with their  fellow veterans.  Veterans First, a community-based organization in my district that serves homeless veterans along with other community groups and  government entities such as the United States  Veterans Administration  (VA), State of California Employment Development Department  (EDD) and Department of Motor Vehicles  (DMV), the County of Orange, the American  Legion, Elks Lodge, American GI Forum, the  American Red Cross, and Furnishing Hope,  have come together to serve a group of brave  individuals who have fought for the freedoms  we value and cherish.  I would  like  to recognize  the First Annual  Orange County Stand Down and commend its  mission to restore honor to our homeless veterans and assist them in rebuilding their lives.  As ranking woman on the Armed Services  Committee, I would like to extend best wishes  of success to the First Annual Orange County  Stand Down in the hopes that it will become  a  sustainable  annual  event  to  assist  our  homeless veterans until all of our heroes are  no longer on the streets.  f  HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION  WEEK, SEPTEMBER 19–25, 2011  HON.

And I congratulate those  institutions for their efforts as HSIs across the  country celebrate National HSIs Week next  week, September 19–25, 2011.  Hispanic Serving Institutions play an important  role  in educating many underprivileged  students and helping them attain their full potential through higher education. National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week recognizes the  contributions of these exemplary institutions at  the forefront of service to our nation’s youngest and largest ethnic population. It is significant that we pay tribute to them for their commitment  to secure academic access, equity,  excellence and success for every American.  Hispanic-Serving  Institutions provide hope  and opportunity to America’s diverse communities of  learners,  reflecting  the belief  that  every American should have access to a college education. While HSIs constitute  less  than 5 percent of America’s  institutions of  higher education, they enroll 50 percent of all  Hispanic Americans enrolled in colleges and  universities.  This year also marks the 25th Anniversary  or Silver Anniversary of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), an  association working to improve the capacity of  HSIs to help students succeed across our nation.  In honoring the many contributions of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), we recognize  the critical  role  that HSIs play  in providing  quality educational opportunities to Hispanics  and to all other students who attend these institutions.  Congratulations to HACU and to the nations’  Hispanic Serving  Institutions, and  thank you  for your service to our communities and your  contributions to higher education.  f  THE INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL  EMPLOYEE  SHORT-TERM  DISABILITY INSURANCE ACT OF  2011  HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON  OFTHEDISTRICTOFCOLUMBIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 15, 2011  ",2011
1627,122,2011-09-15,Ms. NORTON.," Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Federal Employee Short-Term Disability Insurance Act of 2011. This bill will offer  federal employees short-term disability insurance at no cost  to  the  federal government.  Employees will be responsible for 100 percent  of the premiums. If federal employees elect to  purchase  the short-term  insurance provided  for in my bill and they become injured or ill because of a non-work related injury or illness,  federal employees will be able to collect disability insurance benefits, for up to one year,  to replace a portion of their lost income.  I decided to investigate how we could provide short-term disability insurance to federal  employees after learning that many of them already buy short-term disability insurance in the  private market at high  individual  rates. Although  federal employees have good health  insurance,  federal health benefits do not replace lost income if employees are unable to  work. And, while federal employees may have  limited available sick or annual  leave days,  these are often insufficient to cover the costs  of an employee’s living expenses if he or she  has to be out of work for an extended period  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:00 Sep 16, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15SE8.022 E15SEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

1629,6,2011-09-26,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President,  I  wish to follow up on the remarks of  Leader REID by  reminding everyone  how unfortunate but in some ways necessary this situation is.  This whole debate,  in my view,  is  worth having. It is unfortunate it is so  close to the end of the year because the  Senate actually offered a bill, as the  Presiding Officer may remember, earlier in September to try to avoid getting to this last minute. But this whole  controversy started  just a  few days  after Hurricane Irene had raked the  east coast and wreaked havoc  from  North Carolina, through Connecticut,  into Vermont and New Hampshire, and  people are still reeling. The way this  controversy  started was Representative CANTOR said: Before we can provide help, we need to find an offset in  the budget. In other words, before we  can help  the victims of  Irene—the  thousands of homes that were flooded,  the electrical wires on the ground, the  businesses flooded out—we have to go  to Washington and find a program to  cut. I strongly objected then, and I  have objected every day since then to  that Cantor doctrine. So this is an argument and a debate worth having.  This  could  have  been  completely  avoided if, the day after, Representative CANTOR, with all the outcry from  his own district and newspapers around  the country, many of which editorialized against that position, would have  just said: I am sorry, I made a mistake.  And I have had to say that in my political career: I am sorry, I made a mistake. But instead of saying that, he  doubled down, and he doubled down on  the backs of people from Pennsylvania,  to New York, and actually to Louisiana and Mississippi because it is our  projects that have been stopped for the  last 6 weeks. FEMA, as far as Louisiana is concerned, was out of money 6  weeks ago.  This  is what  the Cantor doctrine  looks like to a very clever cartoonist. I  am going to put this up in my office  and keep it forever. It says:  Welcome to the Republican disaster relief  hotline. At the tone, please tell us the emergency and how you plan to offset the cost of  your rescue.  Here is Grandmother sitting on the  roof, with her little cat on the chimney, with her television and her cane,  calling FEMA.  I am the appropriations chair of this  committee, as my colleagues know. It  is a good thing I am chairing this appropriations committee because I happen to know a lot about disaster relief,  having to lead the effort for the gulf  coast  in the wake of Katrina, Rita,  Gustav, and Ike. This is not a little  matter, as some of the press reported  over the weekend. I have read most of  the  editorials  from  coast  to  coast.  Some have written: Why is Congress  arguing? This is such a minor matter.  I don’t think the $40 billion it took to  rebuild the gulf coast is a minor matter, and I don’t think any taxpayer in  America would think $40 billion is a  minor matter.  This Cantor doctrine must be  rejected. I am not the only one who believes this. There are wonderful articles and editorials in papers all across  the country. I am going to read some of  them today. I am so glad people were  working through the weekend and focusing on this debate.  From Colorado,  the Denver Post  writes:  . . . and some Members of Congress are so  bent on budget cutting—  They are  referring  licans, of course—  to  the Repubthat they happily seize the opportunity to  demand concessions, despite the larger impact on our struggling economy. In this case,  it is demanding that money for the Federal  Emergency Management Agency to provide  emergency disaster assistance to communities hit by flood, fire, and other manner of  natural disasters, be offset by comparable  cuts to the Federal budget. Demanding such  offsets is unprecedented in terms of emergency relief, and it has again manufactured  the prospects of a shutdown. To be clear, we  are not supporting a blank check—  And neither am I. I have been an appropriator since I was 23 years old. I  am 56. I understand balanced budgets  and debt  limits and curbing government spending. I have been a part of  those efforts. The last time we had a  balanced budget, a Democrat was in  the White House—Bill Clinton—as the  Presiding Officer knows. We understand there is no such thing as a free  lunch or a blank check, and we are  going to pay for these disasters, but we  don’t have  to  pay  for  them while  Grandmother is on the roof. We can figure out how to pay for it later and send  help to her now.  The article goes on to say:  . . . but we think any near-term spending  cuts are best dealt with by the super committee as opposed to a symbolic standoff  that sends ripple effects beyond Washington.  This is the Brattleboro Vermont Reformer:  Though individuals eligible for Federal disaster aid and State and city governments recouping emergency response costs are still  receiving funds, projects dating back as far  as Hurricane Katrina are once again waiting  for money. How did House majority leader  Eric Cantor of Virginia respond? He said:  ‘‘Change like this is hard.’’  The paper goes on to say:  However, not as hard as waiting for power  lines to get restrung along the Auger Hole  Road, wondering when, if ever, you will be  able to move back into your waterlogged  home or when your road might become passable again. Though Congress has about a  week to get everything ironed out, we can  expect this argument to go down to the last  minute.  I wish we weren’t here at the last  minute. I wish to remind everyone that  the Senate passed—with a bipartisan  response to this, which provided the  money FEMA needed without the offset—it was passed bipartisanly with 10  Republicans and all the Democrats and  sent to the House. They could have  passed that bill, and we would all be  gone now, with FEMA replenished, set  up for the next year, and the jobs program, which is really a private sector  effort to create jobs in America, would  be untouched and would be moving forward.  This argument  started when Representative CANTOR came up with a  new tea party agenda, which  is  for  flood victims to let FEMA know what  offset can be required before they are  rescued.  Other  newspapers  throughout  the  country, including Pennsylvania, say:  Much  of northeast Pennsylvania needs  Federal assistance to recover from flooding,  but two of the region’s representatives—  In this case, both Republican Representatives—  offered an unacceptable condition.  They go on  Members.  They say:  to  say—they  list  the  The problem isn’t the Senate, which earlier had passed a bill by a positive vote that  included 10 Republicans to appropriate more  than $7 billion for FEMA that handles disaster relief. That fund could run dry. The  House responded with a bill that would provide $3.7 billion, but only if two loan programs for energy development projects were  rescinded.  Senator HARRYREID, they say, ‘‘goes  on  to offer a compromise with  the  House.’’ But I guess we are in the time  of no compromise and take whatever  hostages you can. In this case, the tea  party Republicans want to take hostage the Grandma who is on her roof  asking for help.  Even the New York newspapers:  Congress shouldn’t allow disaster aid for  people devastated by Tropical Storm Irene  to be stalled by a fight over how much is  enough and how to cover the tab.  We are willing to negotiate with the  House over how much. We believe our  number of $6.1 billion is not enough for  the year, and I think the records will  show as we move forward that I am accurate. But given the situation we are  in, we don’t need to fight over that  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:40 Sep 27, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G26SE6.006 S26SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011

1631,13,2011-09-26,Ms. LANDRIEU.," I am going to read a  letter written by the Members of the  Indiana delegation. At least three Republicans have signed this letter: Senator LUGAR from Indiana, Representative DAN from  Indiana, and  Representative MIKEPENCE from Indiana.  They wrote, on June 25:  BURTON We write today to highlight the remarkable automotive innovation occurring in Indiana—and  the  tremendous  potential  for  Hoosiers to lead our national effort in transforming the automotive sector. Indiana is  uniquely qualified and prepared to lead the  nation and the world in the development and  commercialization of advanced battery, electric drive vehicles and other  innovative  transportation technologies.  Hoosiers are committed to reaching our  national goal of reducing our dependence on  foreign oil, and they are actively researching, developing, and manufacturing  technologies that will be cleaner and create lasting jobs.  The Hoosier state is the most manufacturing-intensive state in the union and is  home to some 700 automotive related companies which employ more than 130,000 workers. Moreover, Indiana’s broad diversity of  domestic and  international companies,  its  long experience manufacturing light duty,  heavy duty, recreational and military vehicles, and its rich legacy pioneering the development of the electric power train makes the  state a national hub  for automatic automotive technology development.  They go on and on. They say:  Indiana already is home to a number of established and emerging battery and electric  vehicle technology companies. . . .  In addition, Indiana’s world-class research  universities including Purdue University, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, and the University of Notre Dame  have formed an active research and development partnership.  The  letter goes on to say what a  great job they are doing. ‘‘We strongly  encourage you to give  full consideration to the innovative applications for  federal  investment made by  Indiana  companies’’ through the electric drive  vehicle battery component manufacturing initiative and the $25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program. That  is  the  exact loan program Republicans from  Indiana have written to ask funding for  that they are now eliminating to pay  for disasters. If this were a program  that was not working, if this were a  program that did not create jobs in  America, if this were a program that  Republicans privately and publicly acknowledged was not a good program,  that would be one thing. But to run  home and cut ribbons, to say you are  creating  jobs  in  Indiana or  in New  York or in Illinois and then run up here  and cut  the program, claiming you  have to do so to help disaster victims  when it is just about unprecedented in  the history of our country, there  is  something terribly wrong.  We do not need to be destroying jobs;  we need to be creating them. We do not  need to be making excuses about how  we do not have to help victims of disasters; we need to be helping them.  I guess I take this a little bit personally because while the rest of the Members  sort of  say  things  like: Well,  FEMA  is not really running out of  money, and they can probably make it  until Friday—there is some talk about  that going on. There are some technical ways that could be done—I wish  to remind everyone here that this is already  an  emergency  for  over  400  projects that were shut down weeks  ago. If you are a small business owner  who had a subcontract building a road  in Alaska, it is an emergency for you  because you were shut down and you  cannot make  payroll. You  already  bought the supplies to build the bridge,  and nobody on the Republican side is  caring about your crisis.  FEMA is technically out of money as  we speak. The only way they are continuing to operate is because they have  shut down these projects.  This is the third time in the last 6  years, to my knowledge, that projects  have been shut down across the country. Why is that right? Many of those  projects are in Louisiana, some of them  are in Mississippi, and some of them  LANDRIEU now are in Joplin. If you were in a disaster that happened a few years ago,  because Republicans either will not  budget the money or will not budget  enough money or every time you go to  ask for a dime, they require an offset  somewhere  else—truly what  is happening  is disaster victims  in other  parts of the country are subsidizing  this foolishness.  This does not  fall equally on the  backs of Democrats and Republicans. I  know people are tired of hearing it, but  it does not. HARRYREIDdid not start  this  fight. MARY did not  start this fight. DICKDURBIN did not  start this fight. ERICCANTOR of Virginia, a Republican leader, started this  fight when he said: We cannot fund the  2011 disasters without an offset.  So in this whole debate, what they  have done is shut down projects in Louisiana and Mississippi despite the fact  that I have said: We don’t really need  an offset. We have made arrangements  in next year’s budget. It is unprecedented, Representative CANTOR. Your  State is going to be hurt as well.  He doesn’t seem to care. But I do  care, and I do think it is worth talking  about.  I don’t know if we will win this battle today. I don’t know if we will win  this vote this afternoon. I am not the  whip. I do not count the votes. All I do  is keep my eyes on the people who are  in disasters because I have had to for  the years I have been, unfortunately,  the Senator from Louisiana who has  been through the worst natural disaster our country has ever known. I  have walked  through  too many destroyed neighborhoods,  I have cried  with  too many people, and  I have  watched what they go through.  For me, this is not a simple change.  This is a major change which we cannot afford in this country and which  our people do not deserve. We cannot  have a budget meeting  every  time  there is a disaster in America and try  to run up here and in 30 minutes or 2  days or a week decide what program we  are going to slash that everybody can  agree to so we can send help, whether  it is to West Virginia or to Florida or  to Michigan or Louisiana. That is no  way to run a government.  Now  tea party people and Republicans want to bring change to Washington. I welcome some of that change  but not this. This is not a change we  need. This  is not a good policy  for  America. I am not opposed to change. I  am adaptable. I am a centrist. I am a  moderate. I can listen to what Republicans and Democrats say, and I am  proud of that. It is a strength. I consider it a strength, not a weakness.  This  is not a change I can support  lightly, and that is what this fight is  about. We may be forced to change, but  if we are, I want the people of America  to know this was ERICCANTOR’s idea.  This is on the tea party agenda. I do  not think it should be on America’s  agenda.

1640,34,2011-09-26,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, in the  aftermath of September 11, Americans  found strength in each other and in our  common values. At a time when polarization and division seem to characterize the public debate on many of the  important issues confronting our Nation, including terrorism and border security, the 10th anniversary of September 11 has been an occasion for us  to reflect and refocus on the core values that unite us as Americans, including the belief that each person should  be free to live without persecution, regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity.  It is in that spirit that I wish today  to recognize the work of the Anti-Defamation League; which has carried out  important work in opposition to the  anti-Semitic sentiments of those promoting September 11 conspiracy theories. As we mark the 10th anniversary  of September 11, we must strongly condemn  the  anti-Semitic  conspiracy  theories that blame Jews or Israel for  carrying out the September 11 terrorist  attacks that continue to this day.  The ADL also plays an  important  role in addressing the consequences of  hate and fostering a dialog through its  recent work with a broad coalition of  groups. In its retrospective, ‘‘9/11 Ten  Years Later: The Changing Face of  Hate, Terrorism  and Democracy  in  America,’’ the ADL assesses the proliferation of anti-Semitic conspiracy  theories related to the September 11  terrorist attacks, the nature and magnitude of homegrown extremism and  terrorism, the growing problem of anti-  Muslim bigotry, and the recalibration  of the balance between security and individual rights. The ADL also has been  a leader in promoting police-community partnerships and expanding training for law enforcement.  We  face  serious challenges  in  the  fight against terrorism and violent extremism. In meeting those challenges,  we as lawmakers should be inspired by  efforts like those of the ADL to transcend division and differences.  On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of September 11, it is an honor for  me to recognize the work of the ADL  and underscore the importance of their  message.  f  RECOGNIZING THE FREEPORT  FLAG LADIES  ",2011
1641,34,2011-09-26,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr. President, today I  wish to pay tribute to three truly remarkable Mainers—Elaine Greene, Carmen Footer and JoAnn Miller, affectionately known as, The Freeport Flag  Ladies.  It has been said that great  things come in threes. That adage applies many, many times over for my  friends and phenomenal Mainers, all  retired  and  residing  together  in  Elaine’s home on School Street  in  Freeport. I am  in awe of them and  their story which is one of unabashed  patriotism, limitless inspiration, and a  love of country that makes us all inexpressibly proud.  Every Tuesday morning from 8 to 9  a.m., regardless of weather and irrespective of season, these renowned Flag  Ladies have stood not far from another  icon  in Maine, L.L. Bean, with the  presence and exuberance of not one,  but three Statues of Liberty having  come to life for the single purpose of  paying rightful homage to those who  have sacrificed for all of us—our brave  service men and women and our first  responders.  And incredibly, they have never, ever  missed a Tuesday—not once. They have  given up vacations and used the money  they saved for this and other endeavors, including sending care packages to  those fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.  They travel to Bangor International  Airport two to three times a week to  join the Maine Troop Greeters, or to  Pease International in New Hampshire,  they attend numerous troop send-off or  welcome-home ceremonies, and Elaine  estimates  she has  taken  1 million  photos of the troops when they greet  them at various locations.  These women project the inescapable  belief that our strength and resolve as  a State and a nation have always emanated not  from Augusta, not  from  Washington, but from the people themselves—from tireless patriots of their  own volition performing the most extraordinary of deeds. I well recall when  we stood shoulder to shoulder as the  steel beams from the Twin Towers—bequeathed by officials at Ground Zero to  the town of Freeport—journeyed this  past May from their hallowed home in  New York to be enshrined  in a 9/11  Memoria1.  Elaine,  Carmen,  and  JoAnn’s  leadership  in  bringing  the  steel to Maine was instrumental.  How fitting it is that this massive  steel beam that once undergirded the  World Trade Center now undergird our  spirits, our hearts, and our memories  in Freeport. After all, there are only a  finite number of steel pieces that remain from the Twin Towers, and the  requests for them within America and  around the world far exceed what is  available. To have the proud distinction of displaying this beam—in which  so much meaning is infused—defies description. But behind Maine’s selection  was the knowledge that we would be  more than custodians of this patriotic  emblem—that we would in fact be its  steward. What better stewards than the  Freeport Flag Ladies.  The words are difficult to find to adequately convey the height of my admiration, not to mention the sense of  privilege I have felt when joining them  on Main Street  to wave American  flags. People honk as they drive by,  they wave, they stop and thank them—  it really is something. Let me just say,  it was the highest of honors to join  Elaine, Carmen, and JoAnn on the 10th  anniversary of the September 11 attacks in Freeport.  Ever since I learned of their exceptional response to the horrific events of  9/11, Tuesdays have never been  the  same for me, for my staff, and for the  countless individuals who have encountered them in Freeport or heard about  them in the news. Indeed, after the heinous acts that occurred that Tuesday  morning on September 11, 2001, when  President Bush asked us all, as Americans, to walk outside and light a candle in remembrance of those individuals taken tragically from us too soon,  Elaine, Carmen, and JoAnn did  just  that. But they also kindled a deeper  flame in all of us by bringing American  flags with  them  to wave on Main  Street in Freeport. And for that we are  so very grateful.  It is fitting that these three women  with backgrounds in health care have  taken it upon themselves—one Tuesday  at a time, one greeting at a time, one  photo at a time, and one good word at  a time—to help heal our Nation by harnessing the best of who we are and  what we stand for, whether in the best  of times or when facing adversity.  When considering their stalwart dedication to our country and those who  serve her, I cannot help but recall one  of Maine’s giants and America’s military heroes, GEN Joshua Chamberlain,  who once said, ‘‘I long to be in the field  again, doing my part to keep the old  flag up, with all its stars.’’ The Freeport Flag Ladies, by being civilian sentinels of  freedom have  indeed been  doing their part for 10 years. Thank  you Elaine, Carmen, and JoAnn.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  TRIBUTE TO DR. C. PAT TAYLOR  ∑",2011
1642,34,2011-09-26,Mr. BLUNT.," Mr. President, today I  pay tribute to Dr. C. Pat Taylor, who  has served as president of Southwest  Baptist University in Bolivar, MO, for  the last 15 years, making him the longest serving president in the 133-year  history of the school. Dr. Taylor already had an impressive record in higher education before coming to SBU in  1996. In the last 15 years he has added  to that record of accomplishment and  earned respect for his leadership and  dedication to the students and community at Southwest Baptist University.  Southwest Baptist University  is a  very special place to me. I earned my  undergraduate  degree  there  and  20  years later served 4 years as its President. Dr. Taylor is my successor, and I  have enjoyed watching the university  grow and get even better under his  leadership.  During  his  SBU:  Dr. Taylor has presented a record  11,881 degrees since 1996.  SBU  has Missouri’s  third  largest  nursing degree program on its Springfield campus.  The number of student missionaries  sent out in North American has doubled to more than 400 in the last decade, and Dr. Taylor hopes to see that  continue to increase.  remarkable  tenure  at  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:04 Sep 27, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A26SE6.019 S26SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011

1644,2,2011-10-04,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I was  in Colombia at the end of August with  a delegation organized by the Washington Office on Latin America.  In Medellin, we met with the National Labor School, or ENS, to discuss  the current labor situation in Colombia. Their reports on threatened and  murdered unionists are internationally  recognized; and because of this, ENS  faces constant threats and efforts to  discredit them.  While not at the levels of the early  2000s,  violence  against  Colombia’s  workers continues. It is persistent and  frequent. It is a reality that cannot be  denied, and it is meant to silence people. At least 40 trade unionists have  been murdered since President Santos  took office last year.  One  benchmark  in  the  Colombia  Labor Action Plan is for the attorney  general’s office to meet with ENS and  determine how to address the more  than 2,900 cases of murdered unionists,  of which 90 percent remain in impunity. The  first meeting happened  in  May, but there’s been no second meeting. In Bogota, I met with Deputy Attorney General Juan Carlos Forero. I  asked him when  the next meeting  would happen, and he  said  ‘‘imminently.’’ Five weeks  later,  still no  meeting.  Last week, Human Rights Watch sent  a study to Colombian Attorney General  Viviane Morales. It says ‘‘virtually no  progress’’ has been made  in getting  convictions for killings of labor activists that have occurred in just the past  41⁄2years. So virtually no progress on  recent murders of labor activists, and  little progress on past cases.  Mr. Speaker, I met with port workers, campesinos, workers on palm oil  plantations, and petroleum and factory  workers. Their reality  is  filled with  risk, threats, and even death. They are  not valued as human beings, Colombian  citizens, or productive members of society. In Cartagena, port workers went  on strike in March. Their working conditions are  inhumane, and they are  forced to work under various subcontracting schemes. These contracts deny  them basic benefits and keep them in  constant uncertainty about whether  they will be working next week or even  the next day. They just want the right  to negotiate their contracts directly  with their employers, the port associations.  The port workers ended their strike  after  just  a  few  days  because  the  Santos government promised to facilitate talks between the workers and the  port associations. But nothing happened. Nothing changed. In fact, some  things are worse. As part of the LAP,  the  most  common  subcontracting  scheme, the so-called  ‘‘cooperatives,’’  was abolished, except nothing was done  to  facilitate  direct  contracting  between workers and their employers. So  a new scheme has popped up called  ‘‘simplified joint stock companies,’’ or  SAS.  Good-bye  cooperatives,  hello  SAS. Meet the new boss; worse than  the old boss.  The government has done little to  help, unfortunately. When I asked Vice  President Garzon about the port workers, he promised to meet again with  their union leader. Mr. Speaker, it’s  not the workers he needs to meet with  and convince  to negotiate.  It’s  the  presidents of the port associations.  Oil workers from Meta showed me  photographs and documents describing  poor living and working conditions, unfair contracts, and how the Canadian  Venezuelan  oil  company,  Pacific  Rubiales, acts like a sovereign government on Colombian  soil, destroying  public roads, firing workers for organizing, and calling in security forces to  tear gas striking workers. I’m sure it’s  not the whole picture, but once again  striking workers returned to work because the government promised to open  talks with the company. Again, all the  workers are asking for is the right to  negotiate directly with the company  about their contracts and their living  and working conditions, and once again  the Colombian Government  let  the  workers down.  In September,  the  strike was  renewed, more explosive on all sides than  the  last  one,  because nothing had  changed since July. Bruno Moro, the  U.N. delegate in Colombia, called on  everyone to come to the table and resolve the crisis, describing the conflict  as the result of no one creating conditions for dialogue. The workers have  again  returned  to work because of  agreements by the government to open  talks with the company. This time, I  hope the government keeps its word.  Mr. Speaker, nothing I saw in Colombia indicated things have changed for  the better on the ground for Colombia’s  workers. Before we take up the FTA,  we must demand  concrete  improvements in labor rights and security for  Colombia’s workers. Whatever we’re  doing now isn’t working, it isn’t making a difference, and  it simply  isn’t  enough.

1646,9,2011-10-04,Mr. POMPEO.," Mr. Speaker,  since  coming to Congress 9 years ago, I have  sadly relearned that the government in  Washington D.C. only grows and grows  and grows. When Democrats and many  Republicans, too, come to the floor of  the House and  talk about  spending  cuts, they are often talking simply  about slowing the rate of growth of  government. There is seldom, if ever,  any real discussion about cutting the  size of  the Federal Government or  about eliminating an entire program or  agency. But today, with $14.8 trillion in  debt, we can’t continue to simply slow  the rate of growth. We’ve got to cut it,  and we’ve got to get rid of some things.  As a first step this week, I will proffer a bill that will eliminate the Economic Development Agency. It’s part  of the Department of Commerce and  was established in 1965 as an element of  President Johnson’s Great Society. For  over 45 years, the EDA has spent billions on  local projects, not national  projects, trying to pick winners and  losers amongst various projects by region, industry, and community. Much  like a stimulus bill or earmarks, the  EDA provides loans and grants to pet  projects  of  the  administration  in  power.  In 2008, the EDA spent $2 million on  the Harry Reid Research and Technology Park at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Just  last year,  it  spent $25 million on the Global Climate  Mitigation Incentive Fund. This year,  the agency will spend almost $300 million of  taxpayer dollars. Now,  this  might not sound like a lot of money  sometimes here in Washington, D.C.,  but  in Newton,  in  Independence,  in  Wichita,  and  in  Goddard,  Kansas,  that’s still a lot of money.  I want to take just a minute to talk  about the EDA. Most folks in Congress  and most  folks back  in Kansas will  have never heard of it. I had not before  I entered Congress. It provides these  grants and loans to projects it selects  all over the country. At its very core,  the EDA is nothing more than a giant  wealth redistribution machine. It takes  money from people in one place and at  one time and redistributes it all across  the  country  for  inherently  local  projects.  For example, it gave $2 million to the  ‘‘culinary amphitheater,’’ wine tasting  room, and gift  shop  in Washington  State. It gave $350,000 to renovate a  theater in Colorado. In 2011, it gave $1.4  million to build infrastructure development so that a steel plant of $1.6 billion could be built in Minnesota. Like  the vast majority of projects,  that  steel plant would have been built without Federal taxpayer dollars. It was a  $1.6 billion project helped by the Federal Government to the tune of only  $1.4 million.  Our even bigger problem, however, is  with EDA. It’s duplicative. It’s just one  of at least 80 Federal economic development agencies. HUD and Ag and HHS  all have economic development grants  as well.  Second, it’s ineffective. It typically  provides a very small part of any given  project. The GAO reports that most of  its financing did not have any significant effect on the success of projects  and produced, at best, inconclusive results and, in some cases, may even detract from a more flexible workforce.  Third, this is an incredibly wasteful  agency. It was identified by GAO as  one of the agencies that ought to go  away. Indeed, a recent inspector general audit of 10 projects totaling $45  million showed that 29 percent of the  grant money had been wasted due to  various violations of EDA grant requirements. Four of the 10 projects  EDA funded in that group were never  completed.  Finally  and  perhaps more  importantly, this is not the role of the Federal Government. As the Cato Institute  has written, the Federal Government  has no business trying to direct economic activity through politicized subsidy vehicles like the EDA. We’ve seen  that with bad outcomes,  like with  Solyndra, only too recently.  Every great  journey starts with a  single step. This is a small agency, but  it’s time for the first time in decades  that we eliminate an entire program,  an entire agency, so that it cannot continue to grow and grow and grow as  part of our Federal Government.  I  would ask my colleagues to support the  EDA Elimination Act.  f  POVERTY  ",2011
1647,9,2011-10-04,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. LEE) for 5 minutes.  ,2011
1648,9,2011-10-04,Ms. LEE of California.," Mr. Speaker,  as one of the founding members of the  congressional Out of Poverty Caucus, I  rise  today  in my ongoing effort  to  sound the alarm on poverty.  As you may know, the census released data showing that 46.2 million  Americans lived in poverty in 2010. The  data also revealed that the poverty  rate for whites was 9.9 percent in 2010.  Worse, the poverty rate  for African  Americans  was  27.4  percent.  For  Latinos, the poverty rate was 26.6 percent. For Asian Pacific Americans, the  poverty rate was 12.1 percent.  These statistics come on the somber  anniversary of the 10 years of the war  in Afghanistan, which was a blank  check that should not have been written and that, of course, I could not support. In many ways, this war has significantly contributed to these staggering statistics, which we know are  not just numbers but are human lives.  We must create jobs. We have to create  a way to maintain our social safety  net.  So today I am here to ask my colleagues to join 47 Members of Congress  and me in a letter to the Joint Select  Committee on Deficit Reduction, asking them to protect vital programs  that comprise our social safety net, including but not limited to Medicaid,  Medicare, and Social Security, as well  as the programs that provide the economic security and opportunity to millions of Americans.  b1030  None of us envy the work of those  members on this Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, as they  will have to make tough choices that  affect the lives of millions of Americans.  However, we  should  all  recognize  that for the last 25 years, when we have  come to deficit reduction agreements,  these agreements have, for the most  part, protected low-income programs.  We  absolutely  cannot  balance  the  budget on the backs of the most vulnerable, those people facing or living in  poverty. This is really a moral obligation that we cannot ignore.  These programs assist  the over-46  million Americans living in poverty in  2010—men, women, children, young and  old alike from all backgrounds—in obtaining or maintaining their access to  basic, mind you, and I am just talking  about basic human needs,  including  food, shelter and health care. These  vital safety net programs both support  and create consumers, which results in  increased demand and  job  creation.  This, of course, reduces our deficit by  enabling people to participate in this  economy.  And not only that, many of these  programs do provide pathways out of  poverty and opportunities for all. More  and more Americans are struggling to  find work and struggling to make ends  meet. And until we create jobs, and we  have a way, a pathway where people  clearly can be provided these opportunities, we have a real moral obligation  to protect these programs. Anything  short of this is really un-American.  In times like these, it’s unconscionable to consider cutting programs that  help those most in need like our Nation’s seniors and our Nation’s children. Asking the Joint Select Committee for Deficit Reduction to protect  these vital human programs is, though,  not enough. We have to do more. The  most effective anti-poverty program is  an effective jobs program.  So while I ask my colleagues to join  me on the letter to the Joint Select  Committee,  I am also here  to ask  Speaker BOEHNER to move the American Jobs Act as soon as possible to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:36 Oct 05, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K04OC7.008 H04OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011
1649,16,2011-10-04,Mr. YODER.," Mr. Speaker, it’s time  to put America back to work again,  and that’s why I rise today to lend my  voice in support of the three pending  free trade agreements that the President has submitted to Congress.  At a time when 13.9 million Americans are looking for employment, these  commonsense, bipartisan bills are the  types of pro-job legislation upon which  this Congress should be focused.  It’s estimated that these agreements  could create hundreds of thousands of  jobs in the United States and increase  American exports by tens of billions of  dollars a year. This means real jobs in  the Third District  of Kansas  and  throughout my home State, where exports are a major component of our  economy, accounting for almost $10 billion  in  economic activity and  supporting 30,000 jobs.  Mr. Speaker, Americans are tired of  partisanship and they’re looking for solutions  to our economic challenges.  Today, let’s come together, pass these  trade agreements, and let’s get Kansas  and all of America working again.  f  AMERICAN JOBS ACT  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2011
1650,16,2011-10-04,Mr. YARMUTH.," Mr. Speaker,  the  American Jobs Act has been presented  to the American people, but  in this  House it doesn’t sound like it’s going  to get much of a hearing. Republican  leadership has called it dead and has  called it a partisan piece of legislation.  Well,  I’ve got some evidence that  shows that  it’s not really that partisan. As a matter of fact, we sent out  a survey to over 4,000 Louisvilleans  asking them for their opinion on all  provisions of the American Jobs Act.  The percentage of support was astounding. Almost 80 percent want to spend  $50 billion to improve our infrastructure; 76 percent want to cut payroll  taxes for every worker, 77 percent to  cut the payroll tax for businesses, 73  percent allowing businesses to write off  100 percent of new investments, a Republican proposal; 79 percent want to  provide a tax credit for hiring American veterans.  No, the only thing that’s partisan  about the American Jobs Act is the Republicans’ attitude about it. And it is  time to pass this act to create a new  future for the American people and a  better American economy.  f  AMERICAN JOBS ACT  (Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)  ",2011
1651,16,2011-10-04,Mr. CONNOLLY  of Virginia.," Mr.  Speaker, how many different jobs could  be created if America just had more  snakes? venom specialists? animal control? mongoose peddler? I only ask because,  in the  face of stagnating  job  growth, Republican leadership in the  House Oversight Subcommittee actually recommended relaxing restrictions  on exotic snake sales to create jobs.  Apparently, in the face of ongoing unemployment, the one job Republicans  feel confident they can create is snake  oil salesman.  In contrast, President Obama’s jobs  proposal takes a page out of a former  Republican  playbook, most  notably  that of Dwight D. Eisenhower, supporting policies  that put Americans  back to work. It includes infrastructure investments to build and repair  schools,  roadways,  bridges,  creating  construction jobs. The President’s proposal cuts business taxes to incentivize  hiring in the private sector, and it cuts  payroll taxes for every current worker  to spur economic demand. These bipartisan policies have been successful in  the past.  The American people need real jobs,  Mr. Speaker, not snake charmers, and I  ask that my colleagues support real  proposals like the American Jobs Act.  f  LABOR-HHS EDUCATION  APPROPRIATIONS CONCERNS  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2011
1652,16,2011-10-04,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  express my  deep  concern  over  the  Labor-HHS Education  appropriations  draft posted last week by the majority.  Not only did this action circumvent  the procedures of the House and disregard the input of committee members, but the bill is misguided and dangerous for our Nation’s families and  economy.  The draft eliminates the cost-effective Title X family planning program,  blocks  funds  for  evidence-based  sex  education programs to instead spend  them on programs proven ineffective  and discriminatory, and, again, threatens to shut down the government over  Planned Parenthood.  This plan harms our health  care  workforce by slashing the job-creating  National Health Service Corps program  by 55 percent and making steep reductions to the Community Health Center  program. And it wipes out the successful Senior Corps and AmeriCorps programs that not only provide jobs, but  also critical low-cost services to our  families and seniors.  The list goes on, but the theme is the  same we’ve seen all year: The majority  is more interested in putting ideology  over common sense and partisanship  over people’s needs.  f  PASS THE AMERICAN JOBS ACT  (Ms. EDWARDS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2011
1653,16,2011-10-04,Ms. EDWARDS.," Mr. Speaker,  the  other side has been in the majority for  39 weeks and they still haven’t passed  a single piece of legislation to create  jobs or help small businesses. And now  they reject out-of-hand, commonsense  ideas in the American Jobs Act that  would help small business owners who  really are the economic engine responsible for creating 70 percent of the jobs  in this country.  Last week, I visited with small business owners  like Susan Bishop,  the  owner of Jaha Hair Studio. She has  been in business 16 years, has eight employees, and she has found it impossible to get a $30,000 credit extension to  meet payroll from a bank that she has  done business with for 16 years. She  wants to expand her business, to hire  others, to train others, and she can’t do  it, but she could with the American  Jobs Act.  Constituents  Abeba  and  Lene  Tsegaye, owners of Kefa Cafe, told me  that they would actually hire someone  if they could get the tax credits available in the American Jobs Act.  So why aren’t we doing it, doing it  for the owners of Kefa Cafe and other  small businesses throughout my congressional district? These are real job  creators. It’s time for this to be our top  priority.  Pass  the American Jobs Act. Get  America back to work. It’s time for the  majority to act.  f  b1230  PENDING FREE TRADE  AGREEMENTS  (Mr. MORAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2011
1654,16,2011-10-04,Mr. MORAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  speak  for  the  three bilateral  trade  agreements which the President submitted to the Congress yesterday. I applaud the administration on the negotiated revisions to these agreements,  which will improve market access in  Korea, tax transparency  in Panama,  and labor rights in Colombia. Through  their hard work, our trade negotiators,  led by Ambassador Kirk, have made  real and significant improvements to  these agreements. Their passage is long  overdue.  While political negotiations over previously uncontroversial Trade Adjustment  Assistance  programs  have  dragged on here in Washington, American businesses have been losing market share in these three countries.

1656,30,2011-10-04,Mr. CARNEY.," I thank my colleague  from Hawaii, one of the other small  States. I know you’re a delegation of  two; we’re a delegation of one. I represent the whole State of Delaware. I  tell my constituents that we have two  Senators and one Member of Congress.  That means that I have to work twice  as hard, Mr. Speaker, to serve the people in my State.  I’m pleased to join my freshman colleagues on the Democratic side of the  aisle this afternoon for our discussion  about small business and job creation,  and I’d  like to talk  for a  little bit  about the situation in my State, the  State of Delaware.  All of us are coming off a district  work week, where we spent our time,  I’m sure, meeting with constituents,  talking to business owners, small business owners, large business owners, and  working our districts. And I did the  same thing in Delaware, not too far  from the Capitol here. I would like to  highlight two meetings that I had in  particular. One was a job fair that we  held in Georgetown, Delaware, which is  the county seat in the lower part of our  State. Many people  from the Washington, D.C. area know Georgetown as  they pass through it to go to our lovely  beaches during the summer time to  enjoy time with their family at the  beach.  This particular day we sponsored a  job fair in Georgetown, along with Senator CARPERand Senator COONS. This  was a program  that Senator COONS  championed  in Wilmington  initially,  and we’ve moved it now to the other  two counties of our State and had a job  fair in Dover and a job fair in Georgetown this past week, really helping to  connect those folks in our State who  are  unemployed  or  underemployed,  people looking to move up with employers who are looking to hire. And  even though we have over 9 percent unemployment nationally and a little bit  over 8 percent unemployment in our  State of Delaware, there are still a lot  of  jobs that go wanting, mostly because the employers are not able to  find people  that have  the  required  skills for that particular enterprise.  So the good news about this job fair  is that we had 55 employers there,  many of whom were prepared to hire  people and offer them jobs, certainly  take resumes and interview people or  set up interviews. But we had over 8,000  people who came seeking employment  or seeking an upgrade in their current  job situation. And that’s a lot of people  in the small State of Delaware in the  least populous area of our State. So it  tells us the very serious problem that  we have with the lack of jobs and the  lack of skills that people might have to  do the jobs that are out there.  Later on in the week, I met at PATS  Aircraft, which is an airplane manufacturing facility at Georgetown Airport.  They’ve been hiring airplane mechanics over the last several years. In fact,  when I was lieutenant governor, one of  the biggest problems that they had was  finding workers that had the requisite  skills to do the jobs that they had.  Now, they have since lost some of that  work; but they were looking ahead and  anticipating,  with  some  assistance  from the FAA, to extend the runway  there  at Georgetown Airport—going  back to your point about the need for  infrastructure to stir business development, business growth and  job creation. If we were able to extend the  runway  there at  the airport, PATS  would be able to hire more mechanics.  But there are a  lot of people out  there, while they might want those  jobs, would not have the skills to do  the work. And so Delaware Technical  and Community College, with the help  of the State government, has developed  a training program specifically to prepare workers for that facility and other  airplane manufacturing  facilities  in  our region.  b1450  We have a Dassault Falcon plant,  which does airplane maintenance and  mechanics at the New Castle County  Airport, as well as a large Boeing facility over the line in southeastern Pennsylvania. So these are jobs. They are  highly skilled jobs. They are jobs that  require mechanical ability. They are  jobs that require training. And there  are certainly lots of folks out there  that are looking for employment, and  these are the kinds of jobs that we need  to prepare people for.  One of the press conferences we had  this week was at Delaware Technical &  Community College where we highlighted a Federal grant that was going  to Delaware Tech to create training  programs for businesses, basically to  enable people to upgrade their skills to  take the jobs that are available. One of  the problems, obviously, that we have  in our country—and  the President’s  employment council has identified this  problem—is that we have jobs that are  out there, but we don’t have people  with the right kinds of skills for those  jobs. So we need to have programs—  and this  is where the public sector  comes into play, particularly technical  and  community  colleges—to provide  that training and those skills for those  folks.  Later on  in the week,  I met and  spoke with the Georgetown Chamber of  Commerce; and the Georgetown Chamber, of course, is comprised mostly of  very small businesses. They had a really simple message for me, as a Member  of Congress, and that is that they see  their businesses struggling because of a  lack of confidence among consumers.  And when you think about the U.S.  economy at large, about 70 percent of  economic activity is consumer driven.  So when consumers don’t have confidence either in their employment situation in the present—they may not be  employed—or their future employment  situation, they’re not willing to spend  money on small business services or  products in the community and, therefore, these small businesses suffer.  So their message to me was really a  simple one,  twofold. One  is: Do no  harm in Washington, DC. Do the work  of the people, solve the problems that  we have, and inspire confidence. And I  think one of the ways that we can do  that—there’s a lot of discussion. Most  of the discussion that I hear from my  constituents in the State of Delaware—  and we’ve had  town hall meetings.  We’re going to have a telephone town  hall meeting tonight. I’m sure I will  hear the same thing: Enough with the  partisan  bickering  back  and  forth  across the aisle. Let’s  focus on the  challenges that we face—creating jobs  and strengthening businesses, creating  a business climate in the short term  where  businesses  can  thrive, where  consumers  can  have  confidence  so  they’ll be willing to spend on small  businesses and other procurement. And  in the long term, address our deficits,  our debt, and our budget imbalances.  If we’re able to do that, we’ll at least  provide some confidence to the people  that we represent that those that they  send from Delaware, the Members of  the House of Representatives here and  our Senators across the Capitol, are  doing their part, are working together,  are focused on not the politics of where  we all stand in relation to the next  election but on solving the problems  that face our country.  I think the vote that we have coming  at the end of this year, which will be  the result of the work of the Committee on the Budget, will be maybe  one of the most important votes in a  number of years. I have heard our majority whip STENYHOYERrefer to it as  the most important vote here in the  last 30 years. And I think that’s right  in many respects, because people out  there, my constituents, your constituents, Ms. HANABUSA, in Hawaii—I see  our colleague from Rhode Island (Mr.  CICILLINE) has joined us as well—our  constituents are asking us, begging us  to do our work to inspire confidence  and to do the right thing for the country. And that involves giving people  the skills they need to be able to do the  jobs that are available out there, creating  confidence  so  businesses  can  make investments, so people will be  willing to spend money and consume so  our economy will get back on its feet  again. In the long term, we’ll set up a  fiscal situation with our government so  that the economy can be strong and  create jobs for my children and their  children.  So I want to thank my colleague  from Hawaii for leading our dialogue  this  afternoon  on  job  creation,  on  small business development across our  country in our respective districts, and  I look forward to sitting here with you  for a few more minutes and engaging in  this dialogue. I just wanted to give a  few words about how the people  in  Delaware are responding to the work  that we are doing or are not doing here  in the Congress.  ",2011

1659,37,2011-10-04,Mrs. ROBY.," The only other thing  that I would have to offer is to say  that, as we move forward in the coming  months and weeks, we’ve got to find  common ground, but we do not have to  forfeit our principles in doing so. We  stand by the things that conservatives  stand by.  It’s a  three-legged  stool:  We’re  fiscally  responsible, we’re  socially conservative, and we are pro-  military, pro-defense. And we can still  stand on that stool but yet continue to  seek  opportunities  to  find  common  ground.  The problem is that the Senate is not  even  having  this  conversation. We  watched 2 weeks ago as they tabled the  continuing resolution that we passed in  the House, meaning they’re not even  going to take an up-or-down vote on  this, and ultimately passed something  much different.  We are asking our  friends on the  other side of the aisle in the Senate  and the White House to have a conversation with us. We have passed all  of these bills that will lift the heavy  hand of government off of the very job  creators in this country; and we just  want an opportunity  to debate and  then find where we do share that common ground, again, without ever compromising our core conservative principles.  Thank you again to the gentleman  from Arkansas. I really appreciate the  opportunity to spend this hour with  you.  ",2011
1660,37,2011-10-04,Mr. GRIFFIN of Arkansas.," I would  like to say a few things, if I could,  about  the President’s  so-called  jobs  bill.  We’ve heard about the desire for bipartisanship. We’ve heard about the desire to work together and find common  ground. Well, not too  long ago, the  President visited us here in the House.  He  spoke  from  the podium and he  talked about his new jobs bill. Well, he  didn’t  talk  about  finding  common  ground. He didn’t really talk about  meeting us halfway, finding areas we  could agree on. He just said, Pass my  bill; pass it as it is. Then he ran around  the country saying, Pass my bill; pass  it as it is. Well, at that time there  wasn’t even a bill here in the House to  pass. And when we finally did get the  text of  it, we saw that  it certainly  didn’t  reflect  bipartisan  agreement,  certainly didn’t reflect meeting halfway. It was stimulus 2, stimulus the sequel, and we know how ineffective the  first stimulus was.  I’m here to work with other folks,  find areas where we can agree and  move forward. But there hasn’t been a  shortage of bills and legislation passed  in this House. As we talked about earlier, we’ve passed bill after bill after  bill that will help create an environment in this country where the private  sector will want to do business and  grow jobs.  When the President’s bill finally got  here, the so-called jobs plan, we found  out there are not even enough Democrats to pass it in the Senate. I see just  a few minutes ago the Republican leader in the Senate wanted to have an immediate vote on the President’s jobs  bill, and he has been blocked. He has  been blocked by the Democrat majority leader in the Senate. He doesn’t  want to allow a vote on the President’s  jobs bill. I suspect that has something  to do with the fact that most of the  Democrats over there aren’t going to  vote for it either. They didn’t just get  here. They were around when the last  stimulus passed and they realize how  ineffective it was. And so the President  can’t even convince his own party to  support his so-called jobs bill.  I think at the end of the day we can  agree here that we want to pass legislation that will help the private sector  grow and create jobs, no question. No  question. We’ve passed a number of  those here, and we’re willing to work  on more. What we need is the Senate to  actually take up some of the stuff that  we’ve passed, because I’ll just say this:  I’ve talked to a lot of job creators in  the Second Congressional District of  Arkansas, which  is basically central  Arkansas, with Little Rock at the core,  and a lot of them, they have money to  invest and expand and create jobs, but  they’re holding on to it. Why? Because  they’re uncertain about  the  future.  They don’t have confidence in the direction of this country. They’re worried.  So businesses, job creators do what  families do. They hold tightly to their  money, save up, hoping that things will  get better, hoping that they will gain  some confidence in the direction of the  country so that they can then spend  that money to expand a plant and hire  more people and what have you.  So what makes  them  uncertain?  What makes them worried? Well, what  I hear is overregulation, the need for  tax reform so that we can be competitive with other countries, the health  care bill that passed last year. That’s  got a bunch of folks worried because  they don’t know what the impact is  going to be. The Dodd-Frank bill is absolutely killing our small town community banks that are a critical source  of credit for small businesses and families. They’re worried to death. All of  this stuff. And let’s not leave out the  debt.  People are concerned about the debt  because the national debt affects the  markets. It affects interest rates. It affects the value of our currency. And  folks see what’s going on in Europe and  they say, man,  if we don’t get this  under control, we’re next.  b1600  All of that, all of those different concerns, those worries, add to the uncertainty.  I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.  ",2011

And he ends his comments  with this, ‘‘Right now, Dodd-Frank appears to have completely killed my  business.’’  We dealt earlier today and we will  continue  to  deal with  the Cement  MACT rule that talks about what we’re  going to do to basic manufacturing elements in our country when it comes to  cement.

Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the  motion to proceed to S. 1619.  The Senate will recess from 12:30 to  2:15 today to allow for our weekly caucus meetings.

We will notify Senators when they are scheduled. I hope  Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, who wish to offer amendments  will contact the managers of the bill.  We need to get these amendments moving as quickly as possible. Hopefully,  on most of them, we can do time agreements. This is important legislation,  and we need to expedite it as much as  possible.  This is a busy work period, and we  have a couple of important holidays.  We have Yom Kippur, which starts Friday at sundown, which is the highest of  all of the holidays of the Jewish faith,  and then we have Columbus Day, which  is Monday.

1665,51,2011-10-04,Mr. REID.," Madam President,  last  night the Senate held an overwhelming  bipartisan vote to move forward with  legislation preventing continued currency manipulation by  the Chinese  Government.  This  unfair  practice,  which  gives  Chinese  exports  an  unmerited  advantage  in  the  global  marketplace,  injures  the American  economy, it hurts American manufacturers, and it costs American jobs, lots  of them.  In 1990, America’s trade deficit with  China was $10 billion. Twenty years  later, thanks to currency manipulation  that gives an edge to Chinese exporters, that trade deficit has soared to  $273 billion—from $10 billion to $273 billion. That trade deficit has fueled the  loss of about 3 million American jobs,  including  2 million manufacturing  jobs, in just the last 10 years alone. In  Nevada, we have lost more than 14,000  jobs to China trade, and it is all because of currency manipulation. The  eight hardest hit States have lost 1.4  million positions total, and 17 States  have lost more than 2 percent of their  jobs.  Manufacturers simply can’t compete  when the Chinese Government gives its  exporters advantages other countries  don’t get. American workers and manufacturers work as hard and are as ingenious as any in the world. They don’t  need  special advantages  to  succeed;  they just need a fair shot. This important  jobs  legislation will give them  that fair shot.  Putting an end to China’s deliberate  actions to undervalue its currency will  even the playing field. It will also support  1.6 million American  jobs. Demanding a fair playing field will pump  $300 billion into our economy in just a  few short years.  But don’t take my word for it. Just  ask American manufacturers. The Alliance  for  American  Manufacturers  called this jobs bill the ‘‘deficit-reducing, job-creating, no-cost stimulus that  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

1674,58,2011-10-04,Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts.," Mr.  President, I appreciate the opportunity  to come down to the floor once again  to speak to you and the American people. I come to the floor today because  there is something that too many people  in Washington, DC, are missing  right now; that is, we are Americans  first.  It is a simple idea but one that seems  easily  forgotten  in politics because  Washington has a way of making elected officials act like partisans rather  than problem  solvers. For  example,  how can any one Member of the Senate  be 100 percent right? I just don’t know  how that happens. How can they also  vote 100 percent of the time with their  own party? Do they honestly believe  their party is right 100 percent of the  time or is it easier than going with the  alternative—easier  than working  together with people whom one doesn’t  agree with on every single issue?  I ran for the Senate to make a difference, and I believe the voters of this  country sent us here to find ways in  which we can all agree, to move our  country forward and to make things  better. Governing wisely doesn’t mean  spending  all  our  time  politicking—  making the other side uncomfortable  by voting a certain way or taking uncomfortable votes, putting those votes  in the bank for more petty attacks during the election season. But why else  would we spend hours and days trying  to ram through one-sided bills that  can’t pass simply to highlight our differences? Is that honestly why we were  sent here today? Because there is no  Republican bill that is going to pass  and there is no Democratic bill that is  going to pass. It needs to be a bipartisan, bicameral effort that the President will sign.  We face very huge challenges. That  means we must rise to the occasion and  rise above politics to accomplish the  very big things the American people  expect from their elected officials. Our  jobs and economic picture, as we all  know, is bleak. The line of unemployed  workers would stretch across America  and back again. Our national debt and  deficits are spiraling out of control.  Working families are getting squeezed  by the high cost of energy, high health  care costs, high education costs. Businesses are squeezed by high tax rates,  burdensome  regulations,  and  uncertainty about the future and the political  leadership  in this country. Our  housing market is frozen, and the government is making it harder and harder, rather than easier, for borrowers to  refinance. Yet with all these challenges  we have, the answer here  in Washington is just more of the same—more  threats, more gridlock, more partisanship. I say enough already, because I  have said this back home in Massachusetts and people, I think, greatly appreciate the sentiments: We are Americans first. If we don’t work together  right now—at this moment  in time,  right now—then we are going to miss a  great opportunity.  We need to focus on jobs. We need to  focus on the economy. That is what I  have done since the day I got elected. I  believe the American people deserve  better. They deserve better than congressional  gridlock  and  political  gamesmanship. For example, the President—not you, Mr. President, but the  President—has given us a jobs bill that  isn’t perfect, but it is a start. The majority leader has said the Senate might  consider the President’s package eventually. Really? Eventually? We are in a  financial emergency. We are going to  talk about creating jobs eventually?  Let’s be honest with those who sent  us. The  current  proposal  from  the  President  isn’t going to pass either  Chamber if it relies entirely on tax increases to pay for it. I know it and the  Presiding Officer knows it. So when we  bring it up, are we going to try to  make it better? Are we going to try to  pass it?  I urge the majority leader to bring  the jobs bill—or jobs bills—to the floor  that can actually get 60 votes as well  as have a chance of passing  in the  House. What would  they  look  like?  They would  look  like parts of  the  President’s proposal that actually have  bipartisan support and can help our fellow Americans immediately. We should  take the things everybody agrees on  and bring  them  forward now—right  now. We could pass a payroll tax cut  for both employers and employees. I  stood when he said that. I clapped. I  agree with him.  We can also pass his version of the  Hire A Hero Act that provides tax incentives for employers to hire our heroes who are returning from doing incredible service for our country. It puts  them back to work. Their unemployment rate is 25 percent. I am all for it.  I clapped again. It is a great idea.  We can get to work on reforming our  Tax Code  in a way that eliminates  loopholes and leads to lower rates. We  can do  these  things.  It  is possible.  Those are the things we agree on and  we should be doing immediately—not  just bringing a bill forward, knowing it  is not going to pass and then spotting  a particular person or party  for an  election season that is so far away that  if we don’t do something right away,  we are going to be in deep trouble and  miss the opportunity. We are Americans first. We can do it better and we  should do it better.  I have been a little bit discouraged—  it seems to go in ebbs and flows—about  the ability to actually have an open  amendment process. We had to sign a  letter to the President guaranteeing we  would actually move forward with the  trade agreements. Then we had an open  amendment process and, quite frankly,  I think when it was done, everybody  was satisfied that it was just that—an  open amendment process—and we got  some good suggestions and sent them  off to the President. I am eager for  those bills to be passed.  We need to allow our Members to  offer their own ideas on job creation.  There  is no  one  particular  person,  whether it be the President, the majority leader, the minority leader, or any  individual here, who has all the ideas  on job creation. Since when? I have a  vote, just as each and every one of my  colleagues does. I am sure the Presiding Officer has some amendments he  thinks would help job growth in his  State. I know we have worked on one  that was cited by independent groups  as being probably the No. 1 way to actually get the economy moving, but we  will not even have the opportunity to  allow that to be filed as an amendment. Is that right? Of course not.  I have a number of bipartisan pieces  of legislation, one of which I just referenced with the Presiding Officer, to  help boost our economy in Massachusetts. Whether it is working with our  fishermen  to  protect  that  industry  which provides food for American citizens  and  throughout  the world  or  whether it is the high-tech sector, biofarming—you name  it—my bills will  help solve, as will the Presiding Officer’s and others, some of our economic  problems. It will not be done overnight,  but it is a first step. There is absolutely no reason we can’t move forward  to have an open amendment process on  a bill that will actually create jobs.  But they will make a difference  in  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:30 Oct 05, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G04OC6.013 S04OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P V 6 K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2011

1678,72,2011-10-04,Mr. BROWN of Ohio.," Mr. President, I  appreciate the Presiding Officer’s comments earlier in support of the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform  Act of 2011. The Presiding Officer and  I—both Democrats—joined by five Republicans and three other Democrats—  are the prime sponsors of the Currency  Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act  of 2011.  The cloture motion on the motion to  proceed was agreed to—the rules in the  Senate are  sometimes a bit  impenetrable, but the cloture motion on the  motion  to proceed  to  the bill was  agreed to last night with 79 votes out  of 98. So there is clear interest in this  body to debate one of the most important jobs bills we have seen in front of  us, I say to the Presiding Officer, in  our almost 5 years in the Senate. I  have not seen in my time here another  jobs bill be voted on this overwhelmingly, this bipartisanly, that was this  important for putting people back to  work.  Let me sort of expand on that. First  of all, this Currency Exchange Rate  Oversight Reform Act of 2011 has broad  support from business and labor. It creates  jobs without spending taxpayer  dollars. In fact, this legislation raises  revenue and reduces our deficit, clearly, because when people go back to  work, people who are now on unemployment benefits—sometimes receiving  food  stamps,  sometimes getting  other subsidies, maybe trade adjustment assistance, which the Presiding  Officer has been so  involved  in—instead, people going back to work will  be paying taxes and not be the beneficiaries of those programs. So it is a  plus both ways in terms of reducing  our government’s budget deficit.  Most important, it is in response to  an enormous problem, an enormous  economic threat, brought on by the  Chinese  Communist  Party  Government.  Senators  SCHUMER,  CASEY,  STABENOW,  SESSIONS, BURR,  SNOWE,  HAGAN, COLLINSand I have been working closely to bring this bill to the  floor. I thank the majority leader, who  usually sits at this desk, for bringing  this bill to the floor to respond, purely  and simply, to China’s protectionist  trade policies. This is not the United  States turning inward and pointing fingers at other countries. This is a response  to Chinese protectionism,  to  Chinese economic policies and trade  policies that have been unfair, that  cheat—the Chinese have cheated—and  that cost us American jobs.  We know when a factory closes—we  have had 50,000; Senator SANDERS said  earlier today, we have had 50,000 factories close in this country in the last  decade or so, not all because of China.  I do not blame them nearly for all that.  But when a factory closes, we know  what it does to a community, whether  it is in Harrisburg, whether it is in  Sharon, whether it is in Erie, whether  it is in Cleveland or Akron or Canton.

1679,79,2011-10-04,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, there are  thousands of small and medium size  counties across our country that form  the backbone of our shared history and  cultural heritage. These communities  shape our political, economic, and social structure. Each has a unique history that defines its region and its citizens. Delta County, MI, set along Lake  Michigan in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, is one such place, and since its inception 150 years ago, has contributed  much to the rich and proud history of  my home State.  While human life in this region dates  back to at least 500 A.D. as evidenced  by cliff paintings found in the area, the  area was first surveyed in 1843, and in  1861, a triangle shaped section of this  land was incorporated as Delta County.  At one point in the early 1850s, the  mouth of the Escanaba River was home  to the largest timber producer in the  world; built by one of the county’s  founding  fathers, Nelson Ludington.  Two years after the county’s incorporation, the Chicago and Northwestern  Railroad constructed Delta County’s  first iron ore dock. Over the ensuing  decade, the residents of Delta County  witnessed the construction of the first  frame houses and a hotel, in addition  to the Sand Point Lighthouse in Escanaba. The Delta County Historical Society restored this lighthouse in 1987,  and it still stands today along Delta  County’s majestic coastline.  The years  following Escanaba’s establishment were prosperous, as Delta  County grew as a transportation hub  for  iron  in the north, powering the  growth of the Great Lakes region’s  manufacturing prowess.  In  1877,  the  city of Gladstone was incorporated at  the end of the Soo Line railroad. Twenty-one years after its founding, Delta  County  constructed  its  first  courthouse, and a year later, in 1883, the village of Escanaba, the county seat, incorporated as a city. Today, the county  takes pride  in  its continued role  in  transporting ore, partnered with a diversified paper industry and its popularity as a destination for tourists visiting one of our Nation’s most pristine  regions.  The Hiawatha National Forest accounts  for more than half of Delta  County’s land area. This beautiful natural resource stretches across Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, touching three  of the five Great Lakes and contains  413 inland lakes, making it a popular  destination  for campers and outdoor  enthusiasts. A respect for the environment is a central part of the culture of  Delta County residents, and  in 1991,  Delta County was awarded one of six  statewide ‘‘model’’ program grants for  a recycling and composting program.  Delta  County’s  sesquicentennial  marks a great moment for the countless  citizens who  have  contributed  much to the success of this region and  have helped shape the cultural fabric of  this area over the last century and a  half. On June 22, Delta County held a  ceremony reminiscent of its 100th anniversary celebration, raising a flag and  exploring in depth the long, rich history of the county. I know my colleagues  in  the Senate  join me and  thousands of citizens across Michigan  in wishing the residents of Delta County the best as they chart a course for  another century of accomplishment.∑  REMEMBERING AMOS MCCLURE  ∑",2011
1680,79,2011-10-04,Mrs. MCCASKILL.," Mr. President,  today  I  pay  tribute  to Mr. Amos  McClure, who passed away on October  1, 2011, at the Veterans Administration  Hospital in St. Louis, MO. A veteran of  the Korean war, during which he was  taken prisoner, Amos lived the life of  an American patriot.  Just out of high school, Amos joined  the U.S. Army in 1948 at the age of 17.  At the U.S. Armed Forces Institute in  Fort Lewis, WA, he became an expert  rifleman before specializing in heavy  infantry during the Korean war. On November 29, 1950—just 19 days shy of his  20th birthday—Amos was captured by  the enemy while serving his nation in  Korea. He spent almost 3 years as a  prisoner of war, until his release on  August 8, 1953—Armistance Day.  Amos was shot and wounded as a  prisoner of war. But Amos was a survivor and his strength and determination helped him overcome both  the  physical and emotional wounds that  were inflicted on so many American  POWs. For his service, and in recognition of the sacrifices he made for his  country, CPL Amos McClure received  numerous military awards,  including  the Prisoner of War Medal.  Amos returned home from serving in  Korea to marry his sweetheart, Norma  Jean Southerland. They were married  for almost 52 years before she passed  away. They leave behind five children.  After his discharge, Amos worked for  the Atomic Energy Commission as a  storage battery technician. Later, as a  civilian  for  the U.S. Air Force, he  worked as a storage battery technician  before moving to St. Louis to become a  service manager and electrician until  his retirement in 2004.  I honor Amos today out of appreciation for the sacrifices he made on behalf of his fellow Americans, for his  contributions to his community, and  for the example he set for his children.  He had the benefit of a strong family  support system and a work ethic that  allowed him to move forward from the  horrors of war. His spirited approach to  life  is  emblematic  of  the  courage,  honor, and strength of our veterans  who fought for our freedom.  I join his family, the people of Missouri, and all Americans, in saluting  Amos McClure’s courage, and I humbly  recognize him for all that he has done  and for all that he endured for this  country. Amos McClure was a  true  American hero.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO MAUREEN  BEAUREGARD  ∑",2011

The Eagle Scout  rank  is  the highest advancement rank in scouting. Only about five  percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout  Award. The award  is a performance based  achievement whose  standards  have  been  well-maintained over the years.  To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout  is obligated to pass specific tests that are organized by requirements and merit badges, as  well as completing an Eagle Project to benefit  the community. Zach’s Eagle Scout project involved refinishing a historic monument in the  Elma community.  In addition  to  this project  Zach also took it upon himself to improve the  community’s bike  trail by  landscaping and  erecting  signage  for  the Old Roundhouse  Trail.

JOE BACA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 4, 2011  ",2011
1697,142,2011-10-04,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask  Congress  to  recognize October as National  Breast Cancer Awareness Month  (NBCAM).  Sadly, every  two minutes a woman  is diagnosed with breast cancer, making it the most  commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. I extend my prayers to the women and  families affected by this disease, and my appreciation  to  the  advocates  at Susan G.  Komen working tirelessly on their behalf.  The 2.5 million breast cancer survivors living  in  the United States  today are a  testament  both to courage, and the necessity to promote  awareness  for breast cancer,  following  recommended  screening  guidelines,  offering  treatment to those affected, and continuing to  fund ground-breaking  research. Early detection affords women the best chance of fighting  this disease and we must understand the importance of  regular mammograms and  following recommended screening guidelines.  This October, Susan G. Komen for the Cure  has launched the Promise Action campaign to  increase breast cancer screening rates. Today  Komen is the largest source of nonprofit funds  dedicated to the fight against breast cancer in  the world, but the organization started with a  sister’s promise to end the disease her dying  sister was fighting. Breast cancer touches far  too many  families  in my  community  and  across the nation. We are all indebted to the  Komen affiliates fighting every minute of every  day for a world without breast cancer.  As a husband, father, grandfather, and great  grandfather, I know it is essential to do all we  can in Congress to ensure breast cancer research  is adequately  funded. This  is why  I  have  introduced  legislation  that would  reauthorize the sale of a special-rate U.S. postage  stamp, with proceeds from the stamp funding  breast  cancer  research.  In  2007, Senator  and  I  introduced  legislation  that was signed into public law by the President which  reauthorized  the stamp  through  this year. The Breast Cancer stamp has been  highly successful in both raising tens of millions of dollars  for  important  research, and  raising public awareness of the ongoing need  to fight a disease that affects millions of American women and their families.  On behalf of my wife, Barbara, and my children, we bestow our thoughts and prayers to  those women and their families suffering from  DIANEFEINSTEIN breast cancer. As we recognize October as  NBCAM, we stand by all those affected by this  disease. I will continue to work to raise greater  awareness and promote new funding for research into breast cancer. I am hopeful that  my colleagues, organizations like Komen, and  families across the nation can come together  to fight this disease. God bless the mothers,  sisters, and daughters battling  this disease,  and their families for their love and support.  f  RECOGNIZING THE AIR COMMANDO  ASSOCIATION  AND  THE  AIR  FORCE  SPECIAL  OPERATIONS  COMMUNITY FOR THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF JUNGLE JIM AND  FOR ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO OPERATIONS DESERT STORM AND  ENDURING FREEDOM  HON. JEFF MILLER  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 4, 2011  ",2011
1698,142,2011-10-04,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to recognize  the Air Commando Association  and the Air Force Special Operations Community as they celebrate the 50th anniversary of  Jungle Jim, the 20th anniversary of Operation  Desert Storm, and the 10th anniversary of Operation Enduring Freedom.  Fifty years ago, in response to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev’s call to spread communism via  ‘‘wars of  liberation,’’  the United  States Air Force founded the 4400th Combat  Crew Training Squadron (CCTS) at Hurlbert  Field, Florida. The squadron’s Airmen—hand-  picked and  rigorously screened—formed  the  backbone of a  counter-guerrilla  force  that  would eventually grow into the Air Force Special Operations Command  (AFSOC).  The  4400th CCTS, nicknamed ‘‘Jungle Jim,’’ had a  dual  focus on  training  foreign air  forces  in  counter-insurgency operations, and executing  combat missions against guerrilla  forces  in  Vietnam and other nations fighting communist  insurgencies.  Today,  the Air Commandos  based at Hurlbert Field remember Jungle Jim  as the genesis of the missions they continue  to execute.  By the time Operation Desert Storm began  in August 1990, AFSOC had been formally established. Air Commandos from AFSOC performed direct action missions, combat search  and  rescue,  infiltration, exfiltration, air base  ground defense, air interdiction, special reconnaissance, close air support, psychological operations and helicopter air refueling. Each of  these unique capabilities contributed  to  the  stunning  victory  over  Saddam  Hussein’s  forces, as  the coalition of nations drove  the  Iraqi military out of Kuwait. The dramatic successes of our Air Commandos helped further  cement AFSOC’s role as a premier special operations organization.  When  the United States was attacked on  September 11, 2001, special operations forces  gained a new prominence in efforts to defend  our nation. By  the end of September 2001,  AFSOC had deployed forces to pave the way  for Operation Enduring Freedom, enabling the  Northern Alliance to drive out Taliban and Al  Qaeda  forces who were responsible  for  the  heinous attacks on our homeland. To this day,  AFSOC maintains forces forward-deployed in  defense of our nation.

The Technology Center at the Gerard Carter  Community Center, sponsored by Time Warner Cable and the Jewish Community Center  of Staten  Island,  is  fully equipped with  the  newest computers, high-speed  Internet,  flat  screen and high definition televisions and educational software to help Americans succeed  in  the 21st Century. The hard-working  residents of Staten Island can now take advantage of modern technology to train and search  for 21st century jobs.  Facilities like the Gerard Carter Community  Center provide state-of-the-art  tools  for displaced workers to update their skills and regain their competitive advantage in the labor  market. It also provides a place for students to  utilize  the  latest  technology  to  further  their  education.  I applaud Time Warner Cable and the Gerard Carter Community Center  for  giving  Stapleton residents access to the latest technology. I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding Time Warner Cable and the Gerard  Community Center to create the Technology  Center—its ventures like this give the unemployed and the underemployed the opportunity  and  the encouragement  they need  to  take  back their lives and get to work.  f  HONORING THE DEER LAKES AA  BOYS VOLLEYBALL TEAM  HON.

This past season, the team  won the WPIAL championship as well as the  Pennsylvania State Championship. I congratulate them on an outstanding season and commend  their hard work  in winning both prestigious titles.  Over the course of their season, the team  showed  remarkable  consistency while  displaying exemplary  team play.  Incredibly,  the  team did not lose a match all season.  I would also like to give special recognition  to two members of the team who played to the  best of  their abilities each and every game.  Tony Nicotra and  Jeremy Gaston deserve  praise for their team leadership and work ethic  throughout the season. Their hard work was  rewarded when they received the co-most valuable player award for both the WPIAL and  state tournaments.  In addition, a team is only as good as the  coaching staff that stands behind their players.  Head coach Richard Tatrn along with assistant  coaches BJ Ruyes, Terry Gaston, Joe Giradi,  and Kevin Hamilton all deserve recognition for  their encouragement, instruction, and leadership throughout their championship season.  I again congratulate the Deer Lakes Boys  Volleyball Team’s players and coaching staff  on all of their achievements. It is with great joy  that I pay tribute to this team on their well-deserved accomplishments this season.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CAPE COD  TIMES  HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING  OFMASSACHUSETTS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 4, 2011  ",2011
1701,149,2011-10-04,Mr. KEATING.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the seventy-fifth anniversary of the  Cape Cod Times, a daily newspaper circulated  throughout the towns and villages of Massachusetts’ Cape and Islands.  Seventy-five years ago, businessmen J.P.  Dunn and Basil Brewer came  together  in a  Hyannis garage  to publish  the Cape Cod  Standard-Times. This union grew out of  the  men’s desire to provide the residents of the  Cape and Islands with access to community  news, so they teamed up with the New Bedford  Standard-Times  for  joint  distribution  through  the 1960s. By 1970, however,  the  success of local small businesses and industries had brought an era of expansion to the  region, augmenting the need for a local paper  to service  the needs and  interests of  the  unique communities of the Cape and Islands.  In 1975, the first Cape Cod Times edition was  published  as  an  ‘‘independent Cape Cod  newspaper,  printed  and  published  on  the  Cape, by Cape Codders, for Cape Codders.’’  Today, the Cape Cod Times provides over  60,000 readers in the region with daily headlines of national and  local  relevance—from  summer beach  closings  to breaking news  across  the  globe. The  paper’s  circulation  reaches beyond the Cape and Islands through  its online subscription, allowing readers to stay  up-to-date on community happenings no matter their location.  Time and time again, the paper has been  recognized for its national significance, having  been named  to such prestigious awards as  ‘‘Newspaper of  the Year,’’  ‘‘Website of  the  Year’’ and ‘‘Sunday Newspaper of the Year’’  by  the New England Press Association,  the  New England Newspaper Association, and the  New England Associated Press Executives  Association.  Having owned a home on Cape Cod  for  twenty years, it is with pride and gratitude that  I congratulate the Cape Cod Times, its editors  and staff on providing seventy-five years of  authentic journalism to the people of the Tenth  Congressional District of Massachusetts. I extend my best wishes to the paper for many  more years of award-winning  journalism  to  come.  f  HONORING WILLIAM ENSIGN  HON.

We offer our condolences to  his wife of 61 years, Joan,  their children  Maria, Kimberly, Madonna, Christopher, Joel  and Thomas, as well as their families.  William J. Ensign was born  in 1924.

1703,3,2011-10-12,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  New York (Mr. GIBSON) for 5 minutes.  ,2011
1704,3,2011-10-12,Mr. GIBSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the fair trade agreements  that we will vote on later today. I commend the Obama administration  for  their work in ensuring that our businesses and workers get the best agreement possible to grow the economy and  create jobs.  While these agreements have been in  the works for years, our country has  benefited from the improvements garnered by our U.S. Trade Representative, Ron Kirk, and his team. This is  particularly evident in their refining of  the South Korean agreement so that  our farmers and automobile manufacturers get a fair deal. Of course, each  trade agreement is different, and they  all have to be evaluated on their merits. Details matter.  Overall, these agreements will help  increase U.S. exports by an estimated  $13 billion, adding $10 billion to our annual gross domestic product and creating nearly a quarter million jobs, including many in my district in upstate  New York; and we’ll do that without  adding a single dollar to the deficit. In  fact, these fiscally responsible agreements will help cut the deficit.  Our farmers, in particular, stand to  gain  significantly  from  these agreements, opening up nearly $30 million in  new business a year for our farmers in  New York. These agreements are enthusiastically supported by our New  York State Farm Bureau and by my  Agricultural  Advisory  Panel,  comprised of farmers from across the 10  counties and 137 towns I represent, a  congressional district with over 1,000  family farmers.  Mr. Speaker, we have the smartest,  hardest-working farmers in the world.  Their  issue  is profitability. We help  farmers when we attack the impediments to growth, which include taxes,  regulations, health care costs, and energy costs. We help farmers when we  have access to quality infrastructure—  not only roads and bridges, but also access to high-speed broadband. And we  help farmers when we expand markets  to help them sell their goods. These  agreements enhance our farmers’ profitability.  Supporting our farmers is supporting  the American way. Our family farmers  represent the best of our country. And  this is also a national security issue—  no farms, no food. We must ensure our  family farms can compete, or we risk  losing them and relying on  imports  with the attendant food security risks.  That’s not what my constituents want;  that’s not what our country wants,  which is why we need to pass these  agreements.  Now, in addition to helping our farmers, the independent, nonpartisan U.S.  International Trade Commission estimates key U.S. manufacturing sectors  are also poised to gain. This includes  the increase of U.S. exports of motor  vehicles and parts by about 50 percent;  metal products by over  50 percent;  chemical, rubber, and plastic products  by over 40 percent; and machinery and  equipment by over 30 percent. This will  directly help companies in my district,  who are already relying on exports,  with  expanding markets  for  selling  their products, companies  like B&B  Forest Products  in Greene County,  Momentive in Saratoga County, EFCO  Products in Dutchess County, and Hudson River Stove Works in my home  county, Columbia.  What’s often missed  in these conversations about trade are some of the  key points. Right now, over 90 percent  of the products coming from Colombia  and Panama are already duty  free,  when less than 40 percent of our goods  currently go duty free to these countries. Our goods to South Korea suffer  under  tariff  rates about  four  times  higher. With passage of these fair trade  agreements, we will address these imbalances. These agreements will add to  our GDP, strengthen existing jobs, and  create new ones.  Let’s recognize what’s at stake, and  let’s not fool ourselves. If we fail to  pass these fair trade agreements and do  nothing, we will fall behind. In South  Korea, we have seen our beef industry  lose more and more of the share of that  country’s  business  year  after  year  since the 1990s. South Korea is poised  to  increase  agricultural  trade with  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:39 Oct 12, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K12OC7.004 H12OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011
1705,10,2011-10-12,Mr.  COFFMAN  of  Colorado.," Mr.  Speaker, today I rise to honor a soldier  who made the ultimate sacrifice and  laid down his  life  for our  freedom:  United  States Army Private First  Class David A. Drake.  Private First Class Drake enlisted in  the United States Army  in January  2011. In the Army, he served as a combat engineer, leading from the front  with his unit, the 515th Engineer Company, 5th Engineer Battalion, 4th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, and deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. On September 28, 2011, he  gave his life in Ghazni province, Afghanistan,  conducting  operations  against the enemy.  David is remembered not only for his  heroics on the battlefield, but for the  tremendous impact he had on his family, friends, and his community. His  brother recalls David’s absolute devotion to others  in describing why he  joined the Army.  ‘‘For him,  it was  pride in serving our country, serving  the people, keeping our freedom.’’ His  character and patriotism are an example for us all.  Private First Class David Andrew  Drake personifies the honor and selflessness of service in the United States  Army. His bravery and dedication to  duty will not be forgotten. As a Marine  Corps  combat  veteran, my  deepest  sympathies go out to his family, his  fellow soldiers, and to all who knew  him.  f  SENIORS TASK FORCE: ENTITLEMENTS  AND  THE  SUPERCOMMITTEE  (Ms. MATSUI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2011
1706,10,2011-10-12,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to voice my support for older  Americans and pledge to protect the  program they have paid into, have been  promised and deserve.  Throughout much of the year, we  have heard how Congress needs to cut  Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security benefits under the guise of deficit  reduction. I reject that premise.  I do so for Dale, a Sacramento resident, who, at 70 years old, recently retired with his wife. The dream of retirement went well for a short while,  then utility  and home  repair  bills  started piling up. And if this weren’t  enough, both Dale and his wife have  suffered  deteriorating health, which  has increased their medical bills to levels they cannot afford. Cuts to Medicare or Social Security would, as Dale  put it, ‘‘take from the poorest of the  poor.’’  That is unacceptable. Any proposal  to meet our deficit must meet the test  of protecting our seniors.  f  THE IMPORTANCE OF PRAYER  (Mr. FORBES asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2011
1707,10,2011-10-12,Mr. FORBES.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today on behalf of the Congressional  Prayer Caucus to note the importance  of prayer in our Nation’s history. On  October 12, 1844, 167 years ago today,  John Chambers, the Governor of Iowa  Territory,  issued a proclamation declaring a day of Thanksgiving to God.  Chambers  said,  in  part,  ‘‘I  have  deemed it proper to recommend a day  of general Thanksgiving to Almighty  God for the many and great blessings  we enjoy as a people and individually,  and of prayer and supplications for the  continuance of His mercy and goodness  towards us; and for the prosperity, happiness, and ultimate salvation of the  American people.  ‘‘We  are  told  that  ‘righteousness  exalteth a nation’ and are taught by divine  authority  that  the  voice  of  thanksgiving and prayer is acceptable  to our Father in Heaven. Let us then  unite our voices in the humble hope  that they will reach the Throne of  Grace and obtain for us a continuation  and increase of blessings.’’  f  b1210  PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT WEEK  (Ms. BASS of California asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)  ",2011
1708,10,2011-10-12,Ms. BASS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to recognize National Physician Assistant Week, which  is observed  annually  from  October  6  through October 12.  On October 6, 1967, the first PAs graduated  from Duke University. Today,  more than 40 years later, legions of  practicing PAs have reached the number of over 83,000, and 307 million patients visited PAs last year alone. I  know firsthand the key role of the PA  profession in the delivery of care. Before serving  in office,  I worked  for  nearly a decade as a PA and served as  a clinical instructor who trained future  PAs.  Created in response to a shortage of  primary care physicians, the PA profession today is crucial to developing a  strong primary care workforce. Not  only do PAs provide high-quality, cost-  effective care in virtually all health  care settings, but PAs also extend the  reach of medicine to underserved communities  throughout  the U.S. With  health care reform expanding access to  33 million Americans, PAs are needed  now more than ever.  Mr. Speaker, as we mark the final  day of PA week, I ask my colleagues to  join me  in celebrating the contribution, as well as the promise, of the PA  profession.  f  FREE AMERICA TO TRADE  FREELY WITH COLOMBIA  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2011
1709,10,2011-10-12,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, the  House today will vote on a jobs plan  that will create thousands of jobs for  Americans. I’m talking about the pending free trade agreement with Colombia that has been waiting for years to  be voted on.  In my great home State of Texas,  new jobs will be created in the exporting sectors like petroleum, chemicals,  and machinery. Texas is the number  one State that exports to Colombia,  but in my district alone, the 22 companies that exported to Colombia  last  year paid almost $12 million in unnecessary tariffs. When tariffs on these  products are removed, United States  companies will be able to expand their  markets, export more products, and  create American jobs; and America will  become more of a competitive country  in the international marketplace.  I’ve been to Colombia, and unlike  some South Americans, Colombians  like Americans. They are a U.S. ally.  Free trade with Colombia helps both  nations and solidifies our joint interests in South America. This agreement  is a diplomatic win to help thwart the  influence of dictator Chavez of Venezuela in that region.  Create  jobs. Pass  the  free  trade  agreement with Colombia. It’s good for  Americans, and  it’s good  for Colombians.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE,  AND MEDICAID  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2011
1710,10,2011-10-12,Mr.  CICILLINE.,"  Social  Security,  Medicaid, and Medicare were created  because they reflect the values of our  country. We should be incredibly proud  of  these programs, which provide a  vital safety net for our seniors, and we  should commit ourselves to strengthening them.  There are seniors like Rita Manley,  in my district, who depend on Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Rita  is 82 years old, suffering from cancer.  She lives in Central Falls, Rhode Island. She was recently laid off from her  job at the Central Falls Housing Authority, and relies on Social Security  for income and Medicare to cover her  medication, which costs about $400 a  month. Rita would not be able to afford  her cancer medication without the support of Medicare.  We should do everything we can to  protect and strengthen Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for seniors like Rita all across this country.

1711,17,2011-10-12,Mr. CAMP.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the lead chief Democrat cosponsor of the bill we’re considering  today, the Colombia trade promotion  agreement, Mr. FARRof California.  (Mr. FARR asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2011
1712,17,2011-10-12,Mr. FARR.," I thank the chairman for  yielding.  I rise in support of this agreement.  Look, Colombia  is a very  important  country to us. It has a lot of problems,  but it has incredible potential. Colombia is a big country. It’s the 20th-largest  trade  partner with  the United  States.  It’s our best ally  in Latin  America. It was the oldest democracy  in Latin America, the first country to  accept Peace Corps. It allowed an Air  Force base to be built  in Colombia.  Other countries haven’t allowed that.  They fought alongside of us and are  now fighting alongside of us in Afghanistan. They help us with Mexico drug  cartels by teaching the Mexican national police and military how to handle those cartels.  It’s the first country to adopt a labor  action plan. And let me speak to that.  That  labor action plan was adopted  this year on April 11. You’re going to  hear  a  lot  of  complaints—well,  it  hasn’t moved fast. It’s only been in effect 6 months. It’s already been able to  organize the grocers into unions and  other big industries into unions. It’s  the strongest labor plan ever adopted  in the history of the United States  trade agreements. And that’s not my  opinion; that’s the opinion of the Secretary of Labor of this country. It’s the  opinion of the Congressional Research  Office.  And, frankly, a lot of people say, oh,  this is another NAFTA. No. No. No. It’s  not NAFTA. NAFTA didn’t have the  ILO declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work and the follow-up provisions. This is the Peru free  trade agreement which we passed. It  has that right here under article 17,  and this is the Colombian free trade  agreement. They are exactly the same.  The principles are the same. Number 2  reads, effective recognition of the right  to collective bargaining—effective recognition. That means that anything  that stops that can be brought under  this agreement, an action against the  country.  So,  look,  you’ll  hear  arguments  today that it will create a loss of jobs.  There’s going to be a loss of jobs if we  don’t do this. Do you know that we  have made a free trade agreement with  every single country in Latin America  except Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador? Every one of them, none of them  with  these  labor protections. These  will be the strongest. But if we don’t  lift those trade barriers, all the products that we send to Colombia have a  tariff on them. All those other countries, they don’t. All of the European  countries that are entering into a free  trade agreement with Colombia don’t  have  it. Canada doesn’t have  it. So  guess what? We’re going to lose the  jobs of people who make things here  and send them there because it’s going  to be too expensive to buy them in Colombia. So we don’t want to lose those  jobs. We want to grow those jobs. And  there’s a great market in Colombia to  do that.  They say union workers are not protected, and they’re not allowed to organize. That’s not true. In fact, the only  country that counts the crimes against  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:54 Oct 13, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K12OC7.033 H12OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011
1713,24,2011-10-12,Mr. CAMP.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would just say, this agreement will  create new market access for U.S. exporters  of  consumer  and  industrial  products. Over 87 percent of our exports to Panama will become duty-free  immediately, with the remaining tariffs to be phased out that are left over  a 10-year period. This will cut by more  than half the average 8 percent tariff  that our exporters face.  This will provide U.S. firms with an  advantage  over major  competitors  from Europe and Asia. And because  Panama recently signed an agreement  with the EU, our advantage is dependent on having our agreement enter into  force  immediately. So  it’s not  just  about what the U.S. and Panama are  doing in a vacuum; it’s about what the  rest of the world is doing as well.  As I said, there are key export sectors  that  get  immediate  duty-free  treatment:  aircraft,  construction  equipment, fertilizers, medical and scientific equipment. This levels the playing field for our exporters versus importers from Panama, and this agreement will create new opportunities for  our farmers and ranchers.  More than half of the current U.S.  farm exports to Panama will become  duty-free  immediately.  It gives our  U.S. farmers an advantage over our EU  and Canadian competitors. Our exports  in agriculture to Panama now face a 15  percent average tariff. Our exports of  pork, rice, soybeans and wheat, and  most fresh fruit will receive immediate  duty-free treatment, while our competitors in Asia and Europe will continue to face tariffs on those commodities as high as 90 percent. And that’s  why you’ve seen great support, both bipartisan,  for  this  agreement.  The  American Farm Bureau estimates that  the increase in farm exports to Panama  alone could increase our agricultural  exports by $46 million a year.  Obviously, this agreement also provides our access to Panamanian services markets. It will give our U.S. service  firms market  access,  national  treatment,  regulatory  transparency,  and that is going to be very helpful as  we continue to try to grow our economy and create jobs here in the United  States.  b1420  I would agree with my friend from  Massachusetts, Panama has improved  their tax transparency; and because of  the cooperation, adoption of the Tax  Information Exchange Agreement, as  well as other numerous double taxation  treaties that I won’t repeat that he referenced, they have been removed by  the OECD  from  the  so-called  ‘‘gray  list’’  to  join countries  such as  the  United States that meet internationally-agreed-to tax standards.  So  by  almost  any measure,  this  agreement is positive, and it is something that we should strongly support.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011
1714,24,2011-10-12,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 4 minutes.  Public Citizen is an organization that  dedicates  itself to an  impartial economic analysis of trade agreements.  They  looked  at  the Panama  trade  agreement, and here’s what they came  up with. They said that it includes extreme foreign investor privileges and  offshoring protections and their private enforcement in international tribunals. It includes limits on financial  and other service sector regulation, a  ban on Buy America procurement preferences, limits on environmental safeguards and imported food and product  safety and limits on drug patent rules  that limit generics.  The AFL–CIO is one of the most important workers’ organizations in the  history of this country. They’ve analyzed  the Panama  free  trade agreement, and here’s what they have said.  They’ve said it’s the wrong trade model  at the wrong time. Instead of helping  workers here or in Panama, it rewards  a country that has a history of repressing labor rights and has achieved much  of its economic growth by making it  easy  for money  launderers and  tax  dodgers to hide their income from legitimate authorities.  Moreover, this agreement, which was  negotiated by the previous administration, contains too many flawed trade  policies of the past, rather than laying  out a new and progressive vision for  the future. President Obama should not  waste valuable time and effort advancing  this  inadequate agreement, but  should instead focus on effective job  creation measures, including currency  reform, infrastructure investment, and  robust training and education, and reforming our trade model so that  it  strengthens  labor  rights protections  for all workers, safeguards domestic  laws and regulations, and promotes the  export of goods, not jobs.

In  response  to  the  two  previous  speakers, I just want to highlight at  this time the lunch bucket that I carried with me for over 29 years at Great  Northern Paper Company in the mill.  The Korea free trade agreement is bad  for the workers who carry a  lunch  bucket similar to this.  At this time I would like to yield 1  minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SA´NCHEZ).  ",2011
1716,31,2011-10-12,Ms. LINDA T.," SA´NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  speak  in opposition  to  this  fatally  flawed trade agreement. During a time  when our top priority should be job  creation, Congress  is  instead considering free trade agreements that will  ship more American jobs overseas.  Making matters worse, we need to  make sure that our current trade laws  are being enforced. This Korea FTA  will allow China to dump even more  cheap goods into the U.S. without paying proper duties. And we’re not talking about just a couple of dollars here  either.  Chinese companies  fraudulently  labeled many of their products as ‘‘Made  in Korea’’ to the tune of $153 million  last year. This fraud will mean lost  jobs  and  lost  revenue here  in  the  United  States.  If  this  agreement  passes, more Chinese companies will  I  ignore our trade laws. I think we can  all agree that we should be working toward  supporting  our manufacturing  sector, not making it easier for China  to cheat us.  Working families in this country deserve better than this  flawed agreement. For that reason, I’m urging my  colleagues to vote against it.  ",2011

1718,31,2011-10-12,Mr. MARCHANT.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today in support of these free trade  agreements. Simply  put,  the  trade  agreements create more jobs, increase  exports, and broaden economic growth.  At a time when the United States unemployment hovers around 9 percent,  including 81⁄2percent in Texas, engines  of job growth are needed.  As  the  independent  International  Trade  Commission  points  out,  the  three trade agreements would increase  U.S. exports by $13 billion. While more  jobs are good news for the country as a  whole, Texas, in particular, stands to  benefit from increased trade. In today’s  globalized  economy,  Texas  depends  more than ever on world exports.  Businesses in the Dallas-Fort Worth  area are positioned for big gains. DFW  Airport, one of  the world’s  leading  trade gateways, already handles almost  65 percent of all international air cargo  in Texas. The trade agreements would  increase shipments of goods from DFW  to some of the most lucrative Latin  American and Asian markets.  ",2011

1723,31,2011-10-12,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," On balance, the  package of measures moving forward is  a constructive development for America’s economy, and particularly for my  State of Oregon. The people I represent  will see increased sales abroad of machinery, technology, and agricultural  products. This, in turn, will lead to increased activity at our ports. Beef exports from Oregon will increase to help  our State’s farmers and ranchers. Services ranging from engineering, design,  to the legal sector, all will increase.  The  Korean  free  trade  agreement  means jobs for Oregonians.  Some people have complained this  process took too long, but I commend  this administration and, particularly,  my colleague, Mr. LEVIN, who didn’t  rush  to  approve  trade  deals  that  weren’t good  enough. Dramatic  improvements have been made to the Korean free trade agreement where blatant  unfairness  towards  American  automobile sales in Korea have been  addressed.  Indeed, this agreement  is  now supported by the American workers who make cars. And I commend Mr.  LEVINfor his untiring efforts.  In total, these agreements represent  improvements that we can build upon,  but do not signal that we can relax our  efforts. There’s more that can be done.  We need to redouble our efforts to ensure the benefits of trade are more  widely distributed, and  in the spirit  with which we discussed today, that  they, in fact, are enforced.  I’ve been encouraged by the renewed  commitment to use the tools as they’re  supposed to be. I was pleased the Senate has acted on Chinese currency manipulation, and that the administration’s decision to impose tariffs on illegal Chinese activity in the tire market  was sustained by the WTO. I look forward to helping ensure a continued  focus on appropriate  trade  enforcement.  Our economy has grown increasingly  interdependent around the world, especially in Oregon. Our best efforts are  needed to make sure we realize the  promise of  international trade. It  is  not a one-way street. The years spent  to improve these agreements were an  important step in that direction.  b1530  ",2011

1725,31,2011-10-12,Mr. KISSELL.," Madam Speaker, I rise  in strong opposition to the Korean free  trade agreement, and I want to make  two points. One, Korea is a very important ally, a good friend of ours. It’s  just that their name is on the latest of  these NAFTA-type template deals that  we’ve been asked to pass. Two, I love  exports, but if you look at our trade  deficit, you’ve got to figure out that we  don’t know how to get our exports  higher than our imports, not even get  close.  I want to talk about the textile industry today. I spent 27 years of my  life working in textiles. Hundreds of  thousands  of  good Americans were  working there. Their only mistake was  in  believing  their American Dream  could be fulfilled in an industry that  our government decided to give away  in trade deals. Now we’re at it again.  The South Korean  free trade agreement will eliminate around 40,000 textile jobs. How much more can one industry be asked to give? They give  good solid jobs, and, once again, we  give those jobs away.  We heard  last week  the  average  American working family is now effectively down to a standard of living of  the mid-1990s.

1727,38,2011-10-12,Mr. ROSKAM.," Madam Speaker, as  the public is listening to this, I think  they’re  kind  of  collectively  going,  Whew, finally there’s something that’s  going on in Congress. Finally there’s  something going on with  the other  body. Finally there’s something going  on with the White House that is common  ground  around  a  very  simple  premise, and that’s this: no-cost job  creation. It doesn’t cost a single dime.  For my home State, the proof is in  the pudding. This means it’s going to  help 145,000 Illinois jobs right now that  are tethered within 650 companies that  are dealing with exports. This deal  helps them. Twenty-five percent of all  manufacturing jobs in my home State  of Illinois are related to exports. And  let’s face it, 95 percent of the world’s  consumers live outside of the United  States. So you know what this trade  deal does, this says: game on. The U.S.  can compete. Give us a fair playing  field, and game on. We can compete.  These were hard-headed, hard-nosed  negotiations  led by Chairman CAMP  and  the White House and Ranking  Member LEVINand others. These were  tough deals  that were put  together  that were not just weak handshakes.  This was staring down opponents and  finally coming to common ground and  putting something together that has a  great deal of possibility, a great deal of  promise in a country that is desperate,  I mean absolutely desperate, for solutions; and this is a remedy. This is a  way for us to move forward.  b 1610  It’s important from a strategic point  of view. We’ve got one of our Nation’s  best friends poised in Asia, the 10th  largest economy in the world, a country that has moved from the devastation of the Korean War, that has transcended all of that and is now a donor  nation, and we’ve got the opportunity  to be in a unique and strategic relationship with them.  This is our opportunity to move forward. I think we need to support all of  these FTAs. I urge their passage.  ",2011

1730,38,2011-10-12,Ms. KAPTUR.," I thank my dear colleague Mr. MICHAUD, who has fought  equally hard.  I’m proud to stand here on behalf of  the communities and workers and businesses of our country that want to  compete on a level playing field. The  problem with our trade policies is they  export more U.S. jobs than products.  The gentleman  talks about possibility. I don’t want possibility. I want  results. When you look at what’s happened over the last quarter century, we  don’t have  any  balanced  trade  accounts. They’re all  in the red. And  these trade deficits snuff out economic  growth. Didn’t  anybody  here  take  math? Look at the balance sheet. It’s  all negative.  This  is Korea today. All negative.  Our trade accounts with them have  been negative. They’re already negative. What difference does this deal  make? It only says  ‘‘maybe.’’ Maybe  Korea will allow us to sell more than  7,450 cars in their market when they’re  selling half a million here already.  Shouldn’t reciprocity be at the heart of  our trade deals?  We’ve got a half a trillion dollar  trade deficit. How many times do you  have to be hit over the head before you  say, You know what? This isn’t working.  Soybean exports aren’t enough. Cranberries aren’t enough. Look at the job  outsourcing of America from coast to  coast. Our people’s wages are going  down. Their standard of living is going  down. Their jobs have been outsourced.  They’re losing their homes. Unemployment is stuck. GDP isn’t rising. Is anybody here listening? Is anybody paying  attention?  This is just another example of powerful Washington elites being totally  out of step with Main Street and the  American people.  I’m proud of the Tea Partiers who are  out there organizing and I’m proud of  the Occupy Wall Street rallies because  they’re saying, You folks, you are out  of step up here in Washington. Pay attention to what is happening on Main  Street.  I oppose this agreement with Korea  as well as Colombia and Panama and  ask this Congress to have some real  common sense and move to trade balance rather than trade deficit. Create  jobs in America by balancing our trade  accounts.  ",2011

1732,38,2011-10-12,Mr. CANSECO.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  in strong support of the South  Korea free trade agreement, which is  the most significant trade agreement  the United States has negotiated  in  more than 16 years, and I thank the  leadership of our chairmen, Mr. CAMP,  Mr. BRADY, and Mr. DREIER, in this regard.  The  International Trade Commission’s analysis shows that the South  Korean agreement will  increase U.S.  exports to South Korea by at least $9.7  billion annually, the tariff cuts alone  will add $10.1 billion to the U.S. economy annually, and that U.S. exports to  South Korea will increase by nearly 30  percent more than imports from South  Korea.  The economic activity that will result from the South Korean agreement  will mean thousands of new jobs here  at home. The Commerce Department  has estimated that every $1 billion in  exports creates 6,000 new jobs.  In  particular,  the  South Korean  agreement is especially beneficial for  agriculture.  In  the  23rd District of  Texas, I have the privilege to represent  many  agricultural  producers.  This  agreement would be a huge win  for  American farmers and ranchers by ensuring that our competitors who are  also  seeking  trade agreements with  Korea are not at an advantage in South  Korea’s $15 billion per year agricultural market.

I rise today as a former mill worker  who punched a time clock for over 29  years at  the Great Northern Paper  Company in East Millinocket, Maine.  What I’ve seen firsthand is the devastation that these free trade agreements  can do to our communities.  This agreement is the most economically significant since NAFTA, and its  consequences  for  America’s middle  class will be enormous. Since NAFTA,  we have lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs. We’ve seen more than  50,000  factories close  in  the  last  10  years alone. The Korea FTA will bring  more of the same. It will cost us more  manufacturing jobs, it will shut down  more factories, and it will ship more  jobs overseas, all at a time of 9 percent  unemployment when  the American  middle class can least afford it.  My  colleagues have already highlighted the many reasons to oppose the  Korea FTA, but I want to highlight two  of those  issues again. First,  it does  nothing to protect the U.S. in the face  of Korea’s currency manipulation. Second, this agreement isn’t just a giveaway to Korea; it’s also a giveaway to  China.  Korea has a history of manipulating  its currency to boost its exports.

TEXTILEWORKERSDELIVER27,000 PETITIONS  URGING‘‘NO’’ VOTEONU.S.-KOREAFTA  UNITEDSTATESREPRESENTATIVEVIRGINIA  FOXX(R–NC)  2,584 PETITIONSSIGNED  The U.S. textile  industry has witnessed  firsthand  the  damage  that  poorly  constructed trade agreements inflict on textile  and apparel producers in our country. The  industry requested that the Obama Administration renegotiate the textile and apparel  chapter of the Korea FTA and was ignored.  At a time when our country’s unemployment rate remains at record high levels, the  industry would like to count on you to stand  up for textile jobs and vote NO when this  poorly negotiated agreement comes up for a  vote.  The textile industry is creating jobs in the  United States. Exports have increased more  than 16 percent this year alone. The industry  is experiencing a shift of sourcing by brands  and retailers out of China and into the Western Hemisphere in order to take advantage  of the hemisphere’s unique trading relationship and its ability to quickly supply major  retailers in the U.S.  Enacting the Korea FTA will reverse this  positive trend. The reality is that this agreement benefits China and a select group of  Korean exporters while it hurts U.S. textile  workers.  PLEASEVOTENO ONH.R. 3080, THEU.S.  KOREAFREETRADEAGREEMENT  ",2011

1741,45,2011-10-12,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker,  I  would like to insert into the RECORDa  letter from the International Union of  Painters and Allied Trades and a letter  from the National Farmers Union in  opposition to the Korea FTA.  INTERNATIONALUNIONOFPAINTERS  ANDALLIEDTRADES, AFL–CIO,  Hanover, MD, June 30, 2011.  DEARREPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the  140,000 active and retired members of the  International Union of Painters and Allied  Trades (IUPAT), I am writing you regarding  the proposed Free Trade Agreement between  the United States and the Republic of Korea  (KORUS FTA). I have serious concerns about  duty  free construction materials entering  the United States and the devastating effect  that this and all free trade agreements have  on the manufacturing sector.  The  IUPAT represents men and women  working in the finishing trades as commercial and  industrial painters, drywall  finishers, wall coverers, glaziers, glass workers,  floor covering installers, sign makers, display workers, convention and show decorators, and many more occupations. Our union  is made up of over 400  local union halls  throughout  the United States. While  the  IUPAT is working overtime to make sure  our membership has the ability to provide  for their families through this time of chronic and crippling unemployment, I find it unimaginable that this job killing trade agreement would even be considered. According to  the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 13,700,000  Americans remain unemployed and nearly  2.5 million Americans have given up on finding work because job loss is so rampant in  their communities. The United State International Trade Commission  (ITC)  report  from March 2010 projects that implementation of the Korea Free Trade Agreement  would increase the U.S. goods trade deficit.  This predicted increase in the U.S. trade deficit under the Korean FTA would risk the  jobs of millions of Americans,  including  IUPAT members, employed in our industries.  Even the White House has ceded the point  that this Free Trade Agreement will cost  jobs when they demanded on May 16, 2011,  that Trade Adjustment Assistance be a prerequisite to the ratification of any of the  three pending Free Trade Agreements. While  the IUPAT is supportive of the president’s  promise to provide burial insurance to thousands upon thousands of Americans who will  lose their jobs due to the Korean Free Trade  Agreement. A better policy would be to focus  on rebuilding the frail U.S. economy by investing  in American workers  instead  of  workers from North Korea, Korea, China or  any other country that imports component  parts through Korean ports.  Approximately  20% of  IUPAT members  work  in  the manufacturing  sector. They  work to maintain factories and manufacture  paint, plate glass, and floor covering materials, and fabricating glass systems. According to the ITC, these members’ jobs and their  livelihood would be directly threatened by  the duty free importation of the products  they proudly manufacture or  fabricate as  American made.  IUPAT members working in glass fabrication  shops manufacture  energy  efficient  shells for buildings and factories. Their product would be turned away in favor of duty  free glass panels shipped from Korea. The  ITC report indicates that IUPAT members  who manufacture floor covering materials or  wall coverings would be told to find a new  career when cheap carpets, rugs, and wall  covering materials flood the United States  duty free. It is clear that duty free will destroy American  communities  and  leave  Americans families helpless.  Beyond the very troubling job loss predicted by the USITC, I am deeply concerned  about the weak rule of origin that was negotiated by President George W. Bush in this  Free Trade Agreement. In 2009, millions of  pounds of toxic drywall entered the United  States. That lack of oversight put thousands  of IUPAT members and an estimated 60,000  families at risk. This was the direct result of  allowing  uninspected  products  from  an  under-regulated country. The weak rule of  origin opens the United States, the members  of the IUPAT, and American property owners up to the strong possibility that subpar  and possibly dangerous building materials  will enter the United States and be used in  our homes and businesses.  In the interest of the United States economy and all of the families who wish to be  working again, including the membership of  the IUPAT, I strongly urge you to stand up  for American made products and jobs by voting against the Republic of Korea/United  States Free Trade Agreement.  Sincerely,  JAMESA. WILLIAMS,  General President.  JULY7, 2011.

1743,52,2011-10-12,Mr. KIND.," I thank my good friend  and colleague from the committee for  yielding me this time.  Madam Speaker, many of us have  been rising throughout the course of  the debate today talking about the  merits  of  the  three  pending  trade  agreements before us and why it’s important  for us  to move  forward on  them, the reduction of tariff and non-  tariff barriers, greater market access  to the goods, product services that are  being made right here in America, a  system of rules that all countries have  to abide by that are parties to this  agreement, according to international  labor and environmental standards included in the body of the agreement,  fully enforceable with any other provision, protection of  intellectual property rights, and on and on and on.  That’s why I’m supportive of the three  bilateral agreements before us.  But to be honest with the American  people, and as long as trade remains a  two-way street, there will be adverse  impacts of  trade on companies and  workers here in America. When that  occurs, then the workers of that business should not just be left on their  own.  That’s why the reauthorization of the  Trade Adjustment Assistance is important today, to move forward hand-in-  hand with those trade agreements so  those workers will have an opportunity  to upgrade their skills, to go to school,  to have a better match in the job market and find placement as quickly as  possible. Since 1962, the TAA program  has assisted those workers who  lost  their position as a  result of  international  trade, helped  them  retrain  and acquire skills needed for them to  be more competitive in the global marketplace.  In Wisconsin alone in 2010, we had an  estimated 10,359 workers who were covered by this program, and my State’s  not alone. In fact, the three largest  TAA State recipients were Michigan,  Ohio, California.  In 2010 in Wisconsin, 52 percent of the  TAA  participants were  successfully  employed within 3 months of leaving  the program, and 88 percent of those  participants  continued  that  employment over the next few quarters. The  benefit of this program not only helps  workers in my State, but also those  specifically in western Wisconsin that I  represent.  In 2010, again, when Chart Energy &  Chemicals in La Crosse moved some of  its production line to China, approximately 230 employees were laid off, but  they were able to receive reemployment and training services under the  Federal TAA program. When Northern  Engraving Corporation shut down its  Luxco division tool shop in La Crosse,  27 workers were laid off; and they too  qualified for assistance so that they  could get reintegrated in the regional  economy.  There are many more examples of  that throughout Wisconsin and, I am  sure,  throughout  the  country. And  that’s why it was a bit discouraging  that it took so long for us to reach an  agreement  on  TAA  reauthorization  when there’s wide bipartisan support  and great support on the outside, from  the Chamber of Commerce to the AFL–  CIO, saying this is the right and decent  thing to do for America’s workers if we  are  going  to move  forward  in  a  proactive trade agenda.  I want to take a moment and commend my good  friend and colleague,  the chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee, Mr. CAMP,  for the work  that he did with Senator BAUCUS in  order to get the TAA reauthorization  in the place that it is today. I think it  was very helpful.  The SPEAKER pro  tempore  (Mrs.  MILLERof Michigan). The time of the  gentleman has expired.  ",2011

1745,52,2011-10-12,Mr. KIND.," I thank my friend.  As I mentioned  in committee  last  week during the markup, I think it  would make sense if the committee,  Ways and Means that had jurisdiction,  were to hold some hearings as we move  forward on ways that we can improve  the efficiency and the outcome of the  TAA program. Any program is worthy  of change and improvements. I think  this is right for that.  My concern is this is only a 3-year reauthorization. I hope we can continue  bipartisan support that continues beyond 3 years so it’s not having to be  linked to other trade agreements, but I  think our committee has some work to  do to improve a very successful program.  I encourage my colleagues to support  it.  ",2011

1748,52,2011-10-12,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Madam  Speaker, I thank the Ways and Means  Committee for their excellent work on  the trade agreements and, most importantly, on Trade Adjustment Assistance; and I agree with the comments of  my colleague  from Wisconsin about  why this program is so important.  I mean the bottom line is the TAA  and the trade agreements themselves  are part of figuring out how to help  American workers and the American  economy compete in a very, very difficult global economic situation. The  amount of skills that our workers need  now are vastly beyond what they needed  in previous generations, and the  need  to update  them constantly  in  order to continue to be competitive, to  continue to be employable are a significant challenge for American workers.  This program  is one way  to give  them help, to help give them the training and the skills that they need to  continue to be employable. It is incredibly important for our workers, and we  have heard the statistics about the  number of workers in our country who  have benefited from these programs.  But I also submit to you that it is  critically important to our economy.  Our economy needs a skilled workforce  in order to compete. Trade Adjustment  Assistance  is one way  to help our  workers get  those  skills  that  they  need. Certainly it helps them, but it  also helps our businesses and our overall economy.  I, along with my colleague from Wisconsin, support all three trade agreements. I believe trade is critically important to growing our economy as  well, and it’s simple math. Ninety-five  percent of the people in this world live  someplace  other  than  the  United  States of America, but  the United  States of America is responsible for 20  percent of the world’s consumption.  If we’re going to grow, we need access  to other markets. Korea, Colombia,  and Panama are good steps in that direction to give us access to those other  markets so that our businesses can  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:43 Oct 13, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K12OC7.113 H12OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

1763,66,2011-10-12,Mr. CARTER.," Reclaiming my time, I  agree with everything that you say,  and I want to say this further: it’s the  duty of the President of the United  States and the executive branch to enforce the laws of the United States, to  protect  the  borders  of  the United  States  against  intrusion.  It’s  their  duty to protect our Nation from those  who would wreak havoc and harm upon  our Nation wherever they may be located, Iran being the primary example  on the face of the earth today as a  threat to our country.  And, quite honestly,  jobs are very  important in our country, and once we  get the government out of the way  we’ll get some jobs started, but it’s  time  for  this administration  to do  something on the border of this country to protect the citizens on the border. There’s no reason why a landowner  who lives on the border has to get assassinated like the landowner in Arizona, or has to get run off his land by  armed men, as our landowners in Texas  are doing, without the protection of  the Federal Government. We are the  United States of America, and when  they attack one State, they attack all  of the States of our Union.  b1940  When they attack our border, they  attack every State in this Union. By  the way, there are many Americans  who realize that today. I had sheriffs  from the State of North Carolina and  the State of Maryland and maybe one  other State, I don’t remember where it  was, but those two I know were in my  office telling me, Hey, this violence is  all the way in Maryland, it’s all the  way in North Carolina. They showed  me pictures of an assassinated cartel  member shot in the back of the head  found right outside of a town in North  Carolina.  So these guys in their terror tactics  come from across that border and are  all the way up here on the East Coast  dealing terror in smaller doses but just  as serious for the future of this country. Meanwhile, we’ve got Iran contracting with this criminal element,  which is a ruthless criminal element,  and saying, We want you to do our bidding on our behalf, and here’s  the  money. As Judge POE says, Have gun,  will travel. And you’ll travel and kill  whoever we want you to kill and blow  up whoever we want you to blow up in  any form or fashion that we see fit.  How about a deal? And they were making a deal.  That ought to scare the pants off of  everybody, and it ought to wake the  Obama administration up that there  are serious things being overlooked by  their  cavalier  idea  that  everything  America does  is bad and everything  other countries do is excusable. That  seems to be our policy, to the point  where they’re willing to let an agency  of the United States Government become the biggest gun runner in the history of Mexico in Fast and Furious,  which we are investigating right now  in the Halls of this Congress. These are  things that people ought to wake up  and say, My Lord, this is insane. What  is wrong with us? Where are those people who stood up for Americans and  stood up for freedom and fought for the  right ideas? They seem to have disappeared.  I yield to my friend.  ",2011
1764,66,2011-10-12,Mr. FRANKS of Arizona.," Mr. CARTER,  I think we forget when we talk about  the economy and jobs that the most  important  thing we can do  for  the  economy and jobs is to make sure that  this country is secure and that productivity is allowed unfettered; that it has  a secure environment in which to flourish. If the government will get out of  the way, this economy will flourish. It  will go forward. But if we fail as a government to do what is our duty, which  is national security, there’s nothing  that could damage our economy more.  I remind everyone that we lost $2  trillion in our economy when two airplanes hit two buildings. It’s very easy  to forget the cost of war. Someone said  that war devours everything that peace  gives. And we need to make sure that  we defend this country and make sure  that the people who are investing in  this country and are trying to work in  this country and be productive know  that they can do so in a fully secure  environment. It is the most important  thing that we can do for our national  economy.  And I would suggest to you that it’s  important for us to start asking this  administration  some key  questions.  The number one question is: Where do  they put the national security of the  United States on their priority list?  Secondly: What are they willing to do  to clarify this dangerous jihadist ideology in stark terms where everyone  can understand what we’re  dealing  with and that we’re willing to do whatever is necessary to prevent terrorism  in this country and protect the American people? And third: What is Mr.  Obama willing to do? What is he willing to do to prevent Iran from gaining  nuclear weapons with which to threaten the peace of mankind?  With that,  I thank my  yielding.  ",2011
1765,66,2011-10-12,Mr. CARTER.," I appreciate you being  here, TRENT. You’re a good friend, and  I value your opinions that you have  given here tonight.  This is a problem that has risen its  head because of this event. We could  talk for days about this because it is so  serious to the future and welfare of  every American citizen. And to think  that any enemy of our country is contracting with a criminal element that  has a track record thus far of killing  44,000 people, many of whom were just  bystanders, just in an ongoing event of  driving their illegal operation. If they  get  involved  in  international  terrorism, heaven help us. I hope that  heaven will. And I hope this administration will take a hard look at where  they’re going to be willing to draw the  line and say, We’re not taking this any  more. And I would argue at least it  ought to be at the borders of our country and at those who would develop a  nuclear weapon that could devastate  mankind.  I thank both of my friends for joining  me tonight, and I yield back the balance of my time.  friend  for  f  PUTTING AMERICANS BACK TO  WORK  ",2011

1847,80,2011-10-12,Mr. HATCH.," I compliment my colleague for his kind and good words on  the floor. He is a great leader in the  Senate, and the Senator from Iowa is  one of the truly great people I have  met.  Today, we are finally considering our  free-trade agreements with Colombia,  Panama, and South Korea. It has been  9 long years since the authority to negotiate  these  trade agreements was  passed by Congress, and it has been  over 4 years, as the distinguished Senator from Iowa said, since each of these  agreements was signed.  After a burst of international economic  engagement  under President  Bush, we witnessed nothing but passive  indifference by the 111th Democrat-led  Congress and  then,  in more  recent  years, by the Obama administration.  While purporting  to  support  trade  and seemingly acknowledging its benefits, the current administration took  little concrete action to advance these  or any trade agreements for years. In  fact, the opposite was true. Instead of  devising ways to gain their approval,  President Obama used his time to create excuses for not supporting any of  the three agreements.  Finally, early this year, under relentless political pressure  from Congress  and  from American  businesses  and  farmers who will benefit  from these  agreements, the administration’s excuses slowly melted away. Then, with  every reasonable excuse gone and with  bipartisan  support  for  passing  the  agreements building and the end  in  sight, President Obama threw another  obstacle in the path of their consideration. This time he made new demands  for more spending on domestic worker  retraining  programs. Let’s  consider  that at a time when virtually every  government spending program faces intense scrutiny and many programs are  being  cut,  this  administration  demanded more spending for a program of  dubious value and with an unproven  track record. In doing so, the President  put his thirst for more spending ahead  of the interests of the broader American economy that would benefit from  these agreements entering into force,  and he risked the tens of thousands of  jobs his own administration  insists  these agreements will create. His reckless demands ground any progress we  had achieved to pass the agreements to  a halt. Accordingly, it took months for  Congress to unravel this substantive  and procedural Gordian knot of the  President’s own making. Meanwhile,  U.S. workers continued to lose ground  as our foreign competitors completed  agreements to benefit their workers at  our expense.  With today’s vote, our Nation can  hopefully begin to awaken  from  its  trade stupor and confront the opportunities and challenges the world economy offers once again. Frankly, I am  baffled by  this administration’s disregard  for trade. They should know  better. Our country benefits from free-  trade agreements, and the reason  is  simple: The tariffs of our trading partners are generally significantly higher  than are those of the United States.  Free-trade agreements even the playing field for U.S. exporters by lowering  the tariffs of the United States and our  trading partners to the same level of  zero.  For those who say they demand fair  trade, it is hard for me to conceive of  fairer trade than that—a level playing  field where our products and services  enjoy the same access and protections  that foreign goods and services enjoy  here in the United States. By leveling  the  playing  field,  free-trade  agreements promote U.S. exports. Indeed,  U.S. exports to our  free-trade-agreement countries increased at a faster  rate than U.S. exports to the rest of  the world from 2009 to 2010. Moreover,  in 2010, U.S. exports to our free-trade  partner countries constituted 41 percent of all U.S. exports. Yet the United  States has free-trade agreements with  only 17 countries, and that is out of the  234 countries on which the U.S. Department of Commerce collects trade data.  So our exports to our free-trade-agreement partners—just 17 countries—come  close to dominating U.S. exports.  Let’s look at this another way. The  combined population of our free trade  agreement partner countries  is only  about 310 million, while the world population is approximately 7 billion. So  almost half of U.S. exports go to the  less than 5 percent of the world’s population  that  lives  in  countries with  which we have free trade agreements.  To me, it is clear that if we really want  to double exports over the next 5 years,  among the best tools available to us  are our free trade agreements.  The export numbers under our recent  free trade agreements certainly bear  this out. Staff economists at the U.S.  International Trade Commission share  these observations on the benefits of  the recent free trade agreements. They  wrote  last month  that  ‘‘the United  States has a significant and sustained  trade surplus with recent FTA partners.’’ In an analysis of recent  free  trade  agreements  that  excluded  oil  trade, these economists noted that the  U.S. trade surplus with these recent  free  trade agreement partners grew  from $1.7 billion in 2005 to $16.7 billion  in 2010, and they stated that this expanded trade surplus was driven mainly by a $24.5 billion increase in U.S. exports to those countries. During this  same period, U.S. non-oil exports to  the recent FTA partner countries increased by 23 percent, while non-oil imports  from those countries grew by  only 3 percent.  So the facts are clear that the recently  implemented U.S.  free  trade  agreements have benefited the United  States. There is little doubt that the  pending U.S. free trade agreements will  do the same. As with existing U.S. free  trade agreements, the free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:36 Oct 12, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G12OC6.017 S12OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2011
1848,87,2011-10-12,Mr. LEVIN.," This is what Mark Zandi  said about the President’s job proposal:  [It] would help stabilize confidence and  keep the U.S. from sliding back into recession.  [It] would add 2 percentage points to GDP  growth next year, add 1.9 million jobs, and  cut the unemployment rate by a percentage  point.  The plan would cost about $450 billion,  about $250 billion in tax cuts and $200 billion  in spending increases.  Many of the president’s proposals [may be]  unlikely to pass Congress, but the most important have a chance of winning bipartisan  support.  They  deserve  bipartisan  support.  Again, most of these proposals have  been made by Republicans, not just by  Democrats. But even if we cannot get  the Republicans to support the proposal—because at least on the spending  side it is the President’s proposal; on  the revenue side, it is now a Democratic Senate proposal in terms of the  millionaires’ surcharge—but if the Republicans will not vote for it, if they  will not offer a substitute, an alternative of their own, if they will not  seek to amend it to improve it, for  heaven’s sake, allow us to take up this  bill.

1855,94,2011-10-12,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, as  every one of our colleagues knows, so  much of what we do depends on the  hard work and commitment of  the  dedicated staffers who toil behind the  scenes on behalf of us and the constituents we represent. I wish to take a few  minutes to recognize a member of my  own staff who has been with me for  many years, through good times and  bad,  and whose work  ethic,  competence, intelligence, and passion for  public service is truly deserving of admiration and recognition as she now  moves on to a new job, after more than  10 years of service in my office.  Alex Glass came to work for me on  April 2, 2001. We hired her on as the  deputy press secretary. She had graduated from Bryn Mawr the year before  and had gone to work for the Gore for  President campaign before joining my  staff. Alex was similar to many young  people who make their way to our Nation’s Capitol after college. She was  passionate about public service, wanted  to make a difference, and cared deeply  about her  country and  the  serious  issues we faced.  From the start, I knew Alex was a  strong addition to my team. But just a  few months later, it became clear to  me she was much more. It was a Tuesday morning. We were right here in the  Nation’s Capitol. My communications  director happened to be traveling that  week. So even though Alex had just  joined my staff, she was my only press  staffer here that day.  As we all remember, a little bit after  9 a.m., we got word in the Capitol that  planes had struck the World Trade Center. Shortly after that, I looked out the  window of the Capitol and saw black  clouds of smoke filling the sky above  the Pentagon.  It was September 11,  2001, a day of unspeakable tragedy and  devastating loss for our Nation. For  those of us here in Washington, DC,  and those in New York, and for families across America, it was a day of  great confusion, uncertainty, and fear.  On that day, Alex stepped up for me,  she stepped up for our office, and she  stepped up for our constituents. Alex  felt the same way every one of us did  that day. But right away, she realized  families in my home State of Washington were going to want to hear from  their elected official in this time of national crisis. She was calm, she was  collected, and she was already thinking  ahead to what we were going to need to  do that day.  So before we even evacuated,  she  quickly scribbled down the phone numbers of  the major press outlets  in  Washington State, and then throughout that dark day and into the night,  Alex  and  I  stayed  together  and,  through our State’s press, I was able to  reach out to families who were desperate  for news and who needed to  know that, despite this tragedy, their  government  remained  strong.  That  day, I knew what Alex was made of,  and I saw that spirit and dedication  again and again over the next 10 years  because Alex always knew what this  job was all about—it was about helping  people and solving problems.  I remember so many times I was in  the room with my staff, where we were  discussing one issue or another. Every  once in a while, we would hear a soft  voice from the chair to my left—Alex  only talks when she has something to  say—and in the clearest and most concise way, she would help bring our discussion  from the theoretical to the  practical: How does this affect families  in our State? How will these policies  help the people I was sent to represent?  These were the questions that were always on Alex’s mind because she knew  those were the most important questions to me.  So many  times over  the years  I  would wake and check my e-mail and  see an article Alex had forwarded to  me—stories  about  veterans  who  weren’t getting the care they deserved,  workers who couldn’t find a job or families falling through the cracks. She  didn’t include a comment with those  stories. She knew she didn’t have to.  She just passed them along because she  knew I would want to see them. She  understood  it was those people, the  ones in those stories, whom I came to  DC to fight for. Alex isn’t from Washington State, but she dove  into her  adopted State with gusto, and within a  few months she knew more about the  issues  facing our  local communities  than most people from Washington.  I remember one time—and I never  thought  I would tell this story out  loud—Alex and I were in Port Angeles,  and someone thought  it would be a  good idea for us to travel in a helicopter to our next event.

1860,115,2011-10-12,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  today in the wake of another very sobering jobs report. Unemployment remains stalled at 9.1 percent; 14 million  Americans are out of work; another 9  million have been forced into part-time  jobs because they simply cannot find  full-time  employment.  These  challenging economic times demand that  Congress and the administration put  aside partisanship and work together  in earnest to address the prolonged  jobs crisis.  Many of the decisions that will come  before Congress in the next few months  will be difficult ones, including those  that must be made to restore fiscal  order to our Nation’s books. But there  are bipartisan measures that we know  will create and preserve jobs now. We  must work together to advance them.  One such measure before us today is  the free-trade agreement with South  Korea. As President Obama stated last  week, this agreement  ‘‘will make  it  easier for American companies to sell  their products in South Korea and provide a major boost to our exports.’’  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:03 Oct 13, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G12OC6.074 S12OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2011
1861,122,2011-10-12,Mr. REED.," Mr.  President,  since  World War II the United States has  traded  away American  jobs  in  the  name of foreign policy by entering into  bilateral and multilateral trade agreements.  With a 9.1 percent national unemployment rate, 14 million Americans  looking for work, and 10.6 percent unemployment in Rhode Island, there are  no more jobs to give. As such, I cannot  support these trade agreements with  Korea, Colombia, and Panama that the  Senate is considering today.  I am not convinced these trade deals  will result in net job growth for the  United States. The International Trade  Commission’s analysis of  the agreements finds negligible changes to aggregate employment and output. Analysis from The Economic Policy Institute estimates that the Korea FTA  would lead to a loss of 159,000 jobs—  much of this in the manufacturing sector. It must be stressed that, according  to these analyses, any potential  job  gains  associated with  increases  in  American exports will be offset by job  losses resulting from increased imports  to the United States.  Moreover, as a recent economic study  has shown, my State is one of the most  susceptible to labor-intensive imports.  And as the International Trade Commission’s sector analysis of these free  trade  agreements  found,  industries  that are based in Rhode Island align  with those foreign industries that will  have the most access to U.S. markets.  I am very concerned that Rhode Island  businesses will feel the brunt of this  import pressure while realizing little of  the potential gains from exports.  It is likely that U.S. job losses associated with the Korea FTA will be disproportionately felt in Rhode Island,  particularly in the textile sector. The  nature  of  the  agreement  and  the  change in tariff schedules pick clear  winners and  losers. U.S. agriculture  and passenger vehicles will be winners,  while manufacturing industries central  to my State like textiles will be losers.  I have heard from Rhode Island businesses opposed to the Korea agreement  for this very reason.  I,  also,  have  serious  reservations  about  the  Colombian  and Panama  agreements.  These  agreements will  have a relatively small impact on the  U.S. economy, but present basic questions of accountability. Colombia has  one of the highest rates of anti-union  violence in the world. Panama has its  own duty free zone and there are concerns about whether there are enough  resources being dedicated to deter illegal  transshipment  of  goods, which  could lead to other nations taking advantage of our trade agreement with  Panama by skirting customs and violating ‘‘rules of origin’’ requirements.  Additionally, despite Panama’s recent  tax information exchange agreement,  questions remain about the degree to  which transparency and bank secrecy  laws will continue to be obstacles to  enforcing U.S. tax law.  Both Colombia  and Panama have  made efforts to correct these issues.  However, the results of these efforts  are not clear and more work remains  to be done to ensure that accountability is built into the system.  I do want to stress that my opposition to these agreements is not meant  to undercut the good work of our partners and allies in Korea, Colombia, and  Panama. Korea is one of our most vital  partners in Asia and a democracy that  shares our values. Colombia is an important Latin American ally that has  made enormous progress in strengthening the rule of law and combating extremist organizations and drug traffickers. And the United States has a  singular  relationship  with  Panama  that has  progressively  strengthened  over time.  However, at this time, I think we  should stop and pause and think about  our domestic needs and how to get our  economy back on track. The United  States needs to enter into trade agreements that will unequivocally benefit  Americans workers—these trade deals  do not. So,  I will vote against the  Korea, Colombia, and Panama trade  agreements, and continue working to  find a better way to promote bilateral  trade that will lead to job growth here  at home.  ",2011
1862,122,2011-10-12,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President,  our  country continues to struggle with the  aftereffects of the housing bubble and  the economic mistakes of the previous  decade. There has been a great human  cost to this economic slump—families  forced out of their homes, shameful increases in child poverty, and a shrinking middle class.  President Obama has offered a number of steps to help heal our economy  and put people back to work. One such  plan includes a doubling of U.S. exports  within five years. Exports are good for  America and good for American jobs.  They  strengthen  our manufacturing  and agriculture sectors and in turn create good paying jobs. Quite simply, to  help create more jobs here at home, we  need to be able to access new markets  and eliminate trade barriers for U.S.  exporters.  At the same time, we must ensure  that we engage not just in free trade,  but fair trade—trade that upholds our  values on labor, human rights, and environmental  protections,  fair  treatment of U.S. products, and supports  transparent markets.

1867,129,2011-10-12,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, today I  rise to pay tribute to Sgt Daniel David  Gurr of the U.S. Marine Corps.  Sergeant Gurr was assigned to the  3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, 3rd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary  Force. He was killed by small arms fire  while on patrol in Helmand Province,  Afghanistan. Sergeant Gurr was only 21  years of age, but as a testament to his  character and reputation, hundreds attended his memorial service and hundreds more lined the procession route  to where he was laid to rest.  Sergeant Gurr always wanted to be a  marine. In fact, his friends and family  from Vernal, UT, remember a young  man who could hardly wait until his  senior year at Uintah High School before enlisting in the Marine Corps. But  even during his school years, his personality  and  character  exemplified  what it means to be a marine. Sergeant  Gurr was the captain of his high school  soccer team and was always there for  his teammates. By all accounts, whether in high school or as a noncommissioned officer, he was a  leader and  loved by many.  Sergeant Gurr had a profound sense  of duty and deep commitment to freedom and liberty. All he asked for was  the opportunity to dedicate his life to  the service and safety of others. His  dedication and leadership were clearly  apparent to the marines who advanced  him to the rank of sergeant, a truly  impressive accomplishment  for a 21-  year-old.  As we grieve the loss of one of this  country’s finest, let us celebrate Sergeant Gurr’s life. His selfless and noble  actions will never be forgotten.  I know I am joined by the entire Senate in extending heartfelt condolences  to Sergeant Gurr’s family. Elaine and I  will certainly keep them in our prayers.  CORPORALRAPHAELR. ARRUDA  Mr. President, today I also wish to  honor  CPL Raphael R. Arruda  of  Ogden, UT.  Corporal Arruda was an Army reservist assigned to the 744th Engineer Company,  416th Theater Engineer Command. As a combat engineer tasked  with finding improvised explosive devices, Corporal Arruda  never  shied  away from driving the lead vehicle on  operations. Out in front protecting his  fellow soldiers was where he was when  an explosion took his life. Adding to  this tragedy, Corporal Arruda’s mother  had died 10 days before, and the corporal was but days away from his 22nd  birthday.  Corporal Arruda was raised in Brazil  until the age of 12. His family immigrated to the United States and settled  in South Ogden, UT, where Corporal  Arruda  graduated  from  Bonneville  High School  in  2008. While  in high  school, he joined the Army Reserves  and left for basic training only days  after  graduating  from  high  school.  After basic training, he attended Weber  State University  for a semester and  planned to continue his education upon  his return.  Upon  learning  about  Corporal  Arruda’s life, I was struck by what his  family and friends had to say about  him. Andrey, his brother and also an  Army reservist, said Corporal Arruda  was the ‘‘life of the party.’’ His fellow  soldiers said the corporal was ‘‘the guy  who pushed everyone and made everyone laugh.’’ It is a special leader who  has the unique ability to motivate others while simultaneously making them  feel at ease.  Corporal Arruda was a brave and selfless soldier. His  family now bears a  heavy burden. However, I hope they  will take comfort in knowing that I am  joined by the entire Senate in extending our condolences over the loss of  Corporal Arruda and his mother. My  wife Elaine and I will have them in our  prayers.  REMEMBERINGMIKEPUSKAR  ",2011
1868,129,2011-10-12,Mr. MANCHIN.," Mr. President, only a  few people in your lifetime stand out as  people of the highest caliber, people  who truly care about making the world  a better place not only for the present  generation but also for the next generation and many generations to come.  My dear friend Mike Puskar was one  of those rare people. My wife Gayle and  I consider ourselves extremely lucky to  have even known a man of his caliber,  let alone be dear friends with him for  many years.  Mike passed away on Friday after a  long battle against cancer.  I first met Mike in the early 1980s before the start of a football game in the  then-gravel parking  lot at the WVU  stadium, a place we both truly loved.  The generator in his motor home was  not working, and, luckily, the generator in my brother’s RV that I was  using did work. So Mike plugged into  our RV that day, and we were plugged  in thereafter.  Mike was a man whose friendship was  unconditional. It was not about whether you lined up exactly with his beliefs.  He supported you as a person.  Mike dedicated his  life to helping  others and to making a real lasting impact in West Virginia. He had a tremendous heart and a strong sense of  giving. Mike truly epitomized the word  ‘‘friend’’ at every level.  We can see Mike’s handprint everywhere—at West Virginia University, at  Mylan Park, and in charitable organizations throughout West Virginia that  serve those in need.  Mike loved to build things—whether  it was his company or the waterfront  in Morgantown. He gave the  largest  gift  in the history of West Virginia  University because he truly believed in  making our State, our schools, and our  hospitals the best in the country. In  fact, that gravel parking lot where we  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:09 Oct 13, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A12OC6.012 S12OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2011
1869,143,2011-10-12,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  rise today to thank Senator BINGAMAN  for leading the effort to reauthorize the  Secure Rural Schools and Community  Self-Determination Act.  Over  100 years ago  this Congress  passed a law which formed a compact  with counties, boroughs and parishes in  rural America where the National Forests are located. That compact stipulated that the Forest Service would  share 25 percent of its revenues with  local governments to support roads and  schools.  This agreement was put into law 60  years before the Payment in Lieu of  Tax  law was written  to help compensate counties for the loss of revenue  caused by the inability to tax federal  property.  Over the years, the Forest Service  shared  billions  of  dollars with  the  counties and, until 1990, the amount of  those payments increased almost every  year. In fact, the Forest Service sold  $1.6 billion worth of timber in fiscal  year 1990. As a result, counties received  more than $402 million in 25 percent  payments to support schools and roads.  More importantly, the Forest Service  timber sale program in 1990 generated  more than 102,000 direct and indirect  jobs in areas that now have the highest  unemployment rates  in the country.  Those  timber  sales  generated more  than $5.3 billion—that is billion with a  ‘‘B’’ of economic activity and $800 million in Federal income taxes. Further,  revenue from the Forest Service’s timber sale program supported many of  the other Forest Service’s multiple-use  programs, including recreation, wilderness, road building and maintenance,  and fire suppression.  All that changed  in 1990 and 1991,  when activists used  the Endangered  Species Act to reduce, and in some instances stop, timber harvesting across  the West. If I could wave a magic wand  and legislate reforms to the many environmental laws that have been twisted  and misconstrued in order to block any  development of our natural resources,  rather than ensuring responsible decision making by our Federal land management  agencies,  as  Congress  intended, I would.  BINGAMAN In the long run, I think that is what  is needed, and I am convinced that  given the economic malaise this country suffers, the American public is beginning to understand the wrongheaded  direction our Federal  land management has taken over the last two and a  half decades.  But I don’t think I can accomplish  that in this Congress, and I am compelled to avoid adding any additional  pain and suffering to the shoulders of  the small rural communities that depend on Secure Rural Schools and  Community  Self-Determination  Act  payments. Therefore I am joining Senators BINGAMANand WYDENand others  in cosponsoring  legislation  to  reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and  Community Self-Determination Act for  another 5-year period.  Senator  has  fully  described the bill, but it reauthorizes the  Secure Rural Schools and Community  Self-Determination Act at fiscal year  2011 payment levels for 5 more years.  We have reduced the annual reduction  in payments from the 10 percent level  in current law down to a 5-percent annual reduction. Under this plan, counties, parishes, communities and schools  will receive up to $364 million in temporary assistance each year  for the  next 5 years.  I say ‘‘temporary’’ because this program was, and  is, designed to be a  short-term bridge  to allow counties  and communities to transition to the  new economic reality that our wrongheaded Federal lands policy has forced  upon them.  I want everyone to also understand  that while having signed on to this bill  I am also considering a number of  other alternative solutions that have  the promise of generating enough revenue and jobs from Federal land activities to make our counties whole. I am  willing to go as far as turning control  of some Federal lands over to counties  so that they may get some economic  benefit from them. But first I will be  taking a careful look at Representative  HASTINGS’s bill to generate additional  resource management by  lifting  restrictions and expediting the processes  needed to offer additional timber sales.  I want everyone to know that if a legitimate, acceptable, offset to pay for  the cost of this program is not identified by the time the bill is ready to  move to the Senate floor, I will have no  alternative but to remove my name  from the bill and will have to work to  defeat the bill.  I would tell my fellow Senators that  the folks in the House Resources Committee are fundamentally correct. We  are going to have to either utilize our  Federal lands to support our rural communities or we should divest the Federal Government of those lands and let  the States, or the counties, manage  those lands. I look forward to working  with my colleagues in the House to  find a path forward for this approach in  this and future Congresses.  I will close by speaking directly to  the counties, parishes, boroughs and  communities that have now depended  on the Secure Rural School program  for more than a decade—and for some  counties  in Oregon, Washington and  Northwest California  for more  than  two decades—the Secure Rural Schools  Payments are coming to an end. It  could be this year if enough people do  not rally around the bill that Senator  BINGAMAN, I, and our other cosponsors  have proposed. It could be 2 years from  now  if Representative HASTINGS and  other Representatives prevail. Or  it  could be 5 years from now if we find the  acceptable offsets needed to pay for our  legislative proposal. My fervent hope is  that the program will be replaced by a  forest management system that actually puts people back to work in the  forest, but it’s coming to an end, and  the counties and schools need to prepare for that eventuality.  By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Ms.  MIKULSKI, Ms. LANDRIEU, and  Mr. CARDIN):  S. 1696. A bill to improve the Public  Safety Officers’ Benefits Program; to  the Committee on the Judiciary.  ",2011
1870,143,2011-10-12,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, today, I  am pleased to introduce legislation to  improve  the Public Safety Officers’  Benefits Act, PSOB. This law, enacted  in 1976, is a vital safety net for our first  responders who are permanently disabled in the line of duty, and for the  families of those who make the ultimate sacrifice while serving their fellow citizens.  This legislation, along with several  technical refinements to the program,  will add certain classes of  first responders who, due to gaps in the law,  have been left without protection. For  example, the bill contains legislation I  introduced in the 111th Congress in response  to  the  tragic death of Dale  Long, a decorated emergency medical  responder in Vermont. The Dale Long  Emergency Medical Service Providers  Protection Act would  protect Mr.  Long’s survivors and those who may  follow and encounter the same limitations under the current law.  Under current PSOB law, in order to  be eligible for benefits, a member of an  ambulance crew must work for an organization that  is deemed a unit of  State or local government, and thus be  deemed a public employee.  In Dale  Long’s  case,  as with  rescue  crews  across the country, he worked for a private, non-profit entity that nonetheless served his community in a way indistinguishable  from an organization  with status as a unit of government.  Based  upon  this  distinction,  Dale  Long’s surviving family was ineligible  for these benefits. This is unfair, and  undermines the Federal policy that is  in place to support and protect these  men and women. The bill I introduce  today would end this disparate treatment.  The legislation also includes a provision  to ensure  that a cadet officer  killed during a dangerous training exercise would be eligible for such benefits.

1871,150,2011-10-12,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Marin County’s departing Director of  Pubic Works, Farhad Mansourian. After more  than three decades of service to the County of  Marin and seven years as Director of the Department of Public Works, Mr. Mansourian has  demonstrated an unparalleled commitment to  the people of Marin. His passion for managing  public works initiatives has earned him the respect and admiration of colleagues across the  North Bay. Mansourian moves on to a position  as General Manager of  the Sonoma-Marin  Area Rail Transit (SMART) District, where his  voice of experience will be  instrumental  in  bringing our regional rail service to completion.  Farhad Mansourian began his service with  the County of Marin in 1980 as a Junior Civil  Engineer, gradually branching into new fields  as he was promoted to administrative analyst,  traffic operations engineer, road maintenance  engineer, and eventually Assistant Director. In  2002, the Marin County Board of Supervisors  named Mansourian Director of the Department  of Public Works, putting him in charge of an  agency with over 200 employees and an annual budget of roughly $80 million.  Since  that  time, Mansourian has distinguished himself as  the principal guardian of  the County’s  infrastructure,  including  roads  and bridges,  flood control operations, hazardous waste systems, and public buildings.  The County has turned to Mansourian every  winter  to keep an aging  infrastructure  functioning in the aftermath of heavy storms. The  community turned to him in the event of emergencies  like  flooding or earthquakes many  times. Mansourian also serves as Co-Commander of  the Regional Urban Search and  Rescue Task Force, which has provided assistance not only in the North Bay, but in other  communities recovering from natural disasters,  as far away as the Gulf Coast.  In countless ways, Farhad Mansourian has  been responsible for keeping our County functioning by facilitating environmental protection  and economic development  that ensure  the  safety of Marin County residents. I have found  him  to be a  thoughtful, reliable, and expert  partner when working  together on  these  important issues.  Over  the past several years, Mansourian  has also been a strong advocate  for  the  SMART initiative linking the urban centers of  the North Bay with a modem and environmentally responsible rail system. He was active in gathering support for the proposal and  in achieving the overwhelming public support  received for the bi-county ballot measure providing SMART funding. Mansourian’s new role  managing the SMART District is fitting for a  man so committed  to advancing  the North  Bay’s vision for its future, while bridging its infrastructure needs with strong environmental  priorities.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in thanking Farhad Mansourian for his many contributions to Marin County. He represents an admirable model of public service, and we wish  him the same success in his new endeavors.

1872,150,2011-10-12,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, I submit an opinion  that I have received from the Government Accountability Office that White House Office of  Science and Technology Policy,  led by Dr.  John Holdren, is in violation of the law and the  Anti-Deficiency Act due to its continued dealings with the Chinese government.  UNITEDSTATES  GOVERNMENTACCOUNTABILITYOFFICE,  Washington, DC, October 11, 2011.  Hon. FRANKR. WOLF,  Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies, Committee  on Appropriations, House of Representatives.  Subject: Office of Science and Technology  Policy—Bilateral Activities with China  This responds to your request for our opinion on the propriety of activities undertaken  in May 2011 by the Office of Science and  Technology Policy (OSTP) with representatives of the government of the People’s Republic of China. Letter from Representative  Wolf to the Comptroller General (May 11,  2011)  (Request Letter).  Specifically,  you  point to meetings with Chinese representatives during the U.S.-China Dialogue on Innovation Policy (Innovation Dialogue) and  the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) held in Washington, D.C., in  May 2011. You ask whether OSTP violated  section 1340 of the Department of Defense  and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations  Act, 2011. Section 1340 prohibits the use of  OSTP appropriations for bilateral activities  between OSTP and China, or Chinese-owned  companies, unless specifically authorized by  laws enacted after the date of the appropriations act. Pub. L. No. 112–10, div. B, title III,  125 Stat. 38, 123 (Apr. 15, 2011).  As  explained  below, we  conclude  that  OSTP’s use of appropriations to fund its participation in the Innovation Dialogue and  the S&ED violated the prohibition in section  1340. In addition, because section 1340 prohibited the use of OSTP’s appropriations for  this purpose, OSTP’s involvement in the Innovation Dialogue and the S&ED resulted in  obligations in excess of appropriated funds  available to OSTP; as such, OSTP violated  the  Antideficiency  Act,  31  U.S.C.  §1341(a)(1)(A).  Our practice when rendering legal opinions  is to obtain the views of the relevant agency  to establish a factual record and to elicit the  agency’s legal position on the subject matter  of the request.

Mrs. Bates passed away on October 9,  2011, following a year-long battle with stomach cancer. Previously, she had beaten both  breast and  colon  cancer, attesting  to  the  strength and perseverance  that drove Mrs.  Bates throughout her life.  Mrs. Bates moved from her native Baxley,  Georgia  to  the Glades area  in Florida as a  child. She graduated  from Roosevelt High  School in West Palm Beach. After graduation,  she enrolled in several business management  courses at what is now known as Palm Beach  State College and  later  found an  interest  in  cosmetology. It was not long until she opened  her own hair salon,  the  Intimate Salon of  Beauty in Riviera Beach. Mrs. Bates was believed to have been the first licensed African-  American beautician in Palm Beach County.  She was known by many in the community  as an activist who worked tirelessly for what  she believed was right and in the best interest  of the Riviera Beach community. She served  as the chairwoman of the Citizens Task Force  and was a campaign manager  for multiple  candidates,  including a successful campaign  for City Council in 2007.  Mrs. Bates was a woman who was  truly  loved by her community and worked hard for  what she believed in. I am deeply saddened  by her passing, which is more than a personal  loss, but also a loss for the community that  she fought for and inspired. Her selfless efforts will continue to be felt for many years to  come.

1876,157,2011-10-12,Mr. BACHUS.," Madam Speaker,  the  free  trade agreement between  the United States  and Colombia means jobs. If you are looking  for bright spots in the U.S. economy, our trading relationship with Colombia is one of them.  Even though we have been operating under a  handicap  to competitors  like Argentina because of higher  tariffs and duties, American  exports to Colombia have been growing. Our  exports last year were worth $12.1 billion, up  26 percent, and the International Trade Commission estimates this agreement will increase  exports by at least another $1.1 billion.  Each of those exports supports jobs in the  United States, not to mention jobs in the State  of Alabama. Colombia  is one of Alabama’s  best export markets in this hemisphere, and it  is an excellent customer for high-value manufactured products like machinery and transportation equipment. Our  former Governor Bob  Riley demonstrated the importance of the partnership when he led a trade delegation to Colombia  in 2009, and  it  is my view  that  this  agreement will create even more opportunities  for mutually beneficial trade.  Colombia is a strategic ally committed to a  free market economy. Working  together, our  governments have made progress in addressing the scourge of narcotics. The Colombian  government has also instituted major labor reforms, and the labor provisions in this agreement reflect the government’s commitment to  protect those rights. For the record, I am submitting information I received from the Colombian Ambassador  to  the U.S.  regarding  the  Action Plan on labor protections.  The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement  will open up new avenues of cooperation between our two countries, and provide an immediate boost to our farmers, the textile industry, our energy industry, and our manufacturers to name just a few. It is a win-win agreement and I am pleased to support it.

At a time  when our national unemployment rate is at 9.1  percent, with 14 million Americans looking for  work, we cannot afford to pass trade agreements that cost jobs here in the United States.  Instead, I urge my colleagues to bring a real  jobs bill—one that will create jobs for American workers—to the floor of the House immediately.  America depends on  trade with countries  around the world to expand export markets for  our products and create good-paying jobs in  the U.S. To achieve  fair  trade, agreements  must not export U.S.  jobs or economically  harm communities. We must  insist  that all  trade agreements promote environmental sustainability, workers’ rights, and improved living  standards  for people  throughout  the world.  The negotiated trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea do not meet  the standard of fair trade agreements and will  leave Americans worse off. I do not support  their passage.  In Colombia, the intimidation and murder of  trade unionists and human rights workers  is  widespread.  According  to  Human  Rights  Watch, over 50 trade unionists were murdered  last year. The Colombian government’s human  rights record may be improving but it is still  very poor. This is not the time to reward Colombia’s poor record with a preferential trade  arrangement. This agreement does not advance fair trade, and I urge my colleagues to  vote against it.  The proposed  free  trade agreement with  Panama  fails  to create any American  jobs.  Widely known as a tax haven for multinational  corporations, Panama has not shown the inclination or ability to change its status as an off-  shore tax shelter. This practice rewards U.S.  companies  that ship  jobs overseas  to avoid  taxation here. This agreement does not advance fair trade, and I urge my colleagues to  vote against it.  In South Korea, between 2001 and 2009,  the U.S. ran a trade deficit in goods of approximately $125 billion. The Economic Policy  Institute  found  that  implementation  of  the  Korea  trade deal would  increase U.S.  trade  deficit by $16.7 billion and result in 159,000  American jobs lost over the next seven years.  According  to Public Citizen,  almost  8,000  good-paying jobs would be lost in the 4th Congressional District of Minnesota. This agreement does not advance fair trade, and I urge  my colleagues to vote against it.  As we’ve seen with free trade agreements  with China, NAFTA, and CAFTA, unfair trade  deals cost American jobs. This is why Trade  Adjustment Assistance, TAA, exists—to provide  training  to workers who  lose  their  jobs  due to trade. Considering TAA while we consider these three agreements is evidence that  these deals result in the loss of jobs here in  the U.S. I support the passage of the needed  TM extension, H.R. 2832, in order to provide  some protections for American workers.  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to  oppose these unfair trade deals and support  the badly-needed extensions of TAA.  f  YES ON COLOMBIA AND PANAMA  AND NO ON KOREA  HON. HOWARD COBLE  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 12, 2011  ",2011
1878,164,2011-10-12,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, at one time, North  Carolina’s Sixth Congressional District was  one  of  America’s  manufacturing  power  houses. Over  the years, our manufacturing  strength has been compromised by discriminatory trade practices that unfairly benefit overseas competitors.  Unfortunately, the Korea-United States Free  Trade Agreement  (KORUS)  is  a  critically  flawed trade proposal. With respect to textiles,  South Korea has a highly sophisticated and  vertically  integrated  industry.  In 2010, South  Korea was America’s 8th  largest supplier of  textiles and apparel by volume. For example,  yarns and  fabrics,  the  largest component of  the U.S. industry, South Korea was America’s  2nd largest source of imports this past year.  The U.S.  textile  industry  is staunchly opposed to the KORUS agreement due to the  fact  that  it provides Korean  textile exporters  with  instant, duty-free access  for virtually all  textile and apparel products, while giving U.S.  producers no time to adjust. At the same time,  KORUS has a number of non-reciprocal tariff  phase-outs that favor the South Korean textile  industry in key product areas.  We also understand that China could exploit  the KORUS agreement by utilizing business  relationships  in South Korea  to  reach U.S.  markets.  Our manufacturers are competing against  foreign trade barriers, high tariffs, export subsidies, state-ownership of enterprises, and currency manipulation. The goals of  this Congress should be to prioritize fixing U.S. trade  policy, stopping manufacturing  job  loss, and  closing the trade deficit.  South Korea and its people are true allies of  the United States, and I value our diplomatic  relations. As a Korean War-era veteran, I have  witnessed  first-hand how  relations between  our two great nations have improved dramatically over the years.  Unfortunately, I cannot support KORUS because it will do real harm to the North Carolina  textile industry. I am sure that our two countries will continue our harmonious  relations,  but I am hopeful that we can reach a trade  deal someday that is fair and equitable to both  trading partners.  On the other hand, trade with Colombia and  Panama does not pose similar threats to the  textile industry in the United States generally  and North Carolina’s Sixth Congressional District specifically.  In  fact,  textile  trade among  these great nations is healthy and balanced—  we trade raw materials, value added materials  and finished goods. Furthermore, agreements  with Colombia and Panama are far less likely  to be exploited by countries such as China or  Vietnam.  Colombia and Panama are strategic diplomatic partners with America  in Central and  South America. Free  trade agreements with  these countries will boost our economy, according  to  the  International Trade Commission. A deal with Colombia will boost exports  of goods by $1.1 billion and add $2.5 billion to  our Gross Domestic Product. An agreement  with Panama will greatly improve the export of  American  agricultural  goods, manufactured  goods, specialized services, and support other  diplomatic efforts to close a notorious tax reporting  loophole  that  involves money  laundering and tax cheating.  The agreements with Colombia and Panama show  the way  fair  trade agreements  should be written. My hope  remains  that a  similar deal can be reached with Korea in the  near future.  f  UNITED  STATES-KOREA  FREE  TRADE AGREEMENT  IMPLEMENTATION ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. DUNCAN HUNTER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 11, 2011  ",2011
1879,164,2011-10-12,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  express my opposition  to  the U.S.-Korean  Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). Put simply,  this agreement is a bad business deal for the  United States.  KORUS is an example of an agreement that  stands to benefit certain industries at the expense of others. For instance, the Obama administration went  to great  lengths  to  include  special provisions  to ensure  that our auto  manufacturers have equal access  to South  Korean markets. While the economic fairness  may help,  the effect  is  likely  to be minimal.  Currently, over 95 percent of South Koreans  drive South Korean cars. Because of  this,  I  have serious concerns about the realistic ability of our auto industry to succeed in a reluctant Korean market.  In addition to my concerns with the feasibility of success for the auto industry in South  Korea,  it  is widely acknowledged  that  textile  workers will lose out because of the deal. The  Economic  Policy  Institute  estimates  that  159,000 American manufacturing jobs will be  lost, and because of the administration’s failure to address textile issues, it is estimated  that 40,000 textile jobs will be lost. I have always said that 1 job lost as a result of free  trade is too much.

1880,171,2011-10-12,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pleasure and pride that I welcome President  Lee Myung-bak of  the Republic of Korea  to  the United States and his address to the Joint  Session of Congress on October 13, 2011. His  visit to our great nation is another significant  step in broadening and deepening the friendship and cooperation between our  two sovereign nations.  For more than 60 years an enduring friendship has existed between  the United States  and the Republic of Korea which has been of  enormous economic, cultural, and strategic  benefit  to both nations. Our countries share  common ideals and a clear vision for the 21st  century, where  freedom and democracy are  the  foundations  for peace, prosperity, and  progress.  During  the Korean War  the United States  and the Republic of Korea forged a bloodshed  alliance. Approximately 1,789,000 members of  the United States Armed Forces served in-theater along with the forces of the Republic of  Korea and 20 other members of  the United  Nations to defend freedom and democracy of  the Republic of Korea  from 1950  to 1953.  Since 1975, the Republic of Korea has invited  thousands of American Korean War veterans  to revisit Korea in appreciation for their sacrifices. Currently more than 28,500 members  of  the United States Armed Forces have  served annually in the United States Forces  Korea to defend the Republic of Korea against  external aggression, and to promote regional  peace.  The Republic of Korea is among the closest  allies of the United States, having contributed  troops in support of United States operations  during the Vietnam War, Gulf War, and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while also supporting  numerous  United  Nations  peacekeeping missions throughout the world.  As a Korean War veteran,  I am proud  to  see that in the 60 years since the outbreak of  the Korean War, the Republic of Korea has  emerged from a war-torn economy into one of  the major economies in the world and one of  the  largest  trading partners of  the United  States.  The success of Republic of Korea is a shining example of the peacekeeping efforts and  contribution made by the United States.  I would  like  to congratulate President Lee  Myung-bak  for  recently being awarded  the  World Statesman Award for his leadership in  furthering democracy,  freedom, peace and  human rights, on September 20, 2011, by The  Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an  interfaith organization founded and presided by my  good friend, Rabbi Arthur Schneier.  I applaud President Lee Myung-bak’s many  accomplishments, including his tenure as the  CEO of Hyundai Engineering and Construction, Member of the Korean National Assembly, Mayor of Seoul, and as the 10th President  of  the Republic of Korea. Under his presidency since 2008, Republic of Korea has  emerged as one of  the key players on  the  international scene through hosting the 2010  G–20 Seoul Summit. Now with the passage of  the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, I hope  that the economies of both the United Sates  and Republic of Korea would continue to prosper as our partnership remains strong.  f  UNITED  STATES-KOREA  FREE  TRADE AGREEMENT  IMPLEMENTATION ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. FRANK D. LUCAS  OFOKLAHOMA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 11, 2011  ",2011
1881,171,2011-10-12,Mr. LUCAS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  this legislation.  The free trade agreement with Korea is of  vital  importance  to America’s  farmers and  ranchers.  Korea is the fifth largest market for our agricultural exports. But currently, America’s farmers and ranchers face an average tariff of 54  percent when  exporting  to Korea. Similar  goods from Korea enter our country at an average rate of only 9 percent.  Passing this agreement corrects that imbalance and gives us better access to Korea’s 49  million consumers.  The Farm Bureau estimates that once the  agreement is fully implemented, we could see  $1.9 billion in increased farm exports.  Every dollar in agricultural exports creates  another $1.31 in economic activity off the farm  in  industries  like processing, manufacturing,  and  transportation. So  the agricultural provisions alone have  the potential  to provide a  significant boost to our economy.  That  isn’t  including  the other  tariff cuts  in  this agreement, which the International Trade  Commission predicts will add more than $10  billion annually to our GDP.  Within agriculture, we could see dairy exports  to Korea quadruple under  this agreement. Fruit and vegetable sales would  increase by 50 percent. And processed  food  sales would increase by more than a third.  Those increased sales will translate directly  to more jobs—both on and off the farm. That’s  especially good news because workers whose  jobs depend on trade earn 13 to 18 percent  more than the national average.  That’s why there is such tremendous support among  the agricultural  community  for  these free trade agreements.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support our  farmers and ranchers . . . to support American jobs . . . and to support this free trade  agreement.  f  REMARKS ON TRADE  AGREEMENTS  HON. RUSH D. HOLT  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 12, 2011  ",2011
1882,171,2011-10-12,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition  to the pending free trade agreements with Columbia, Panama, and Korea we are considering today.  I do not support these agreements for one  simple  reason:  I  remain completely unconvinced that they can create jobs in the short  term. Job creation must be our principal objective. That is what nearly everyone in New Jersey tells me is their concern. Given the tough  economic times we face and the high rates of  unemployment  and  underemployment,  we  need to take steps to help create jobs now. In  my view  these agreements  fail  that  job-creation  test.  Instead of advancing  these steps  that might possibly start producing some jobs  years from now, we should be passing immediately legislation that creates jobs now, legislation that helps homeowners now, and legislation that helps the middle class now.  f  H.R. 3078, THE UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA  TRADE  PROMOTION  AGREEMENT  IMPLEMENTATION  ACT,  H.R.  3079,  THE  UNITED  STATES-PANAMA  TRADE  PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT, AND H.R. 3080, THE  UNITED  STATES-KOREA  FREE  TRADE AGREEMENT  IMPLEMENTATION ACT  HON.

1883,171,2011-10-12,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition  to  the pending  free  trade  agreements (FTAs) with Colombia and Korea.  I wish, however, to commend my good friend  from Michigan and Ranking Member of  the  Committee on Ways and Means, SANDYLEVIN,  for  his  hard  and  effective work with  the  Obama Administration to improve them. Sandy  and the Administration have fought hard to ensure  improved market access  for American  workers and companies, all while insisting that  our trading partners’ labor protections be improved. Nevertheless, my  experience with  FTAs has been one of nearly two decades of  broken promises and widespread domestic  economic dislocation, particularly in my home  state of Michigan. With our economy teetering  on  the edge of  recession and  the painful  memory of millions of lost jobs, I cannot vote  in good conscience for more free trade agreements.  With respect to Colombia, I am disappointed  by the Administration’s decision not to include  the Labor Action Plan as a binding and enforceable provision of the FTA. Colombia has  a well known history as one of  the world’s  most  inhospitable places  for  labor  leaders.  While the country was showing some signs of  progress under the action plan, there is nothing to prevent Colombia from backsliding once  the FTA is in effect and the plan itself does  not have the force of law.  Although  I  recognize  that  significant  improvements in terms of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade have been made in the Korean  trade agreement,  I  rather unhappily believe  that promises will not translate into reality. In  short, I believe the United States is giving up  far too much for mediocre market share gains  in  the short  term. This agreement may well  boost our exports to Korea over the next few  years, but I am firmly convinced that the benefits Korea will reap in the long run—especially  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:09 Oct 13, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A12OC8.052 E12OCPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

1885,6,2011-10-19,Mr. MORAN.," I am here today, as we  debate H.R.  2112,  the Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,  to address a particular provision  that,  in my view,  needs to be addressed. I also hope to  have the opportunity  later today to  offer an amendment regarding the Watershed Rehabilitation Program and to  allocate some additional funds for that  program, and I hope to have the chance  to speak during the debate on this bill  on the proposed school lunch regulations the Senator from Maine has so  appropriately addressed previously.  At this time, I would like to turn my  attention to a problem with the pending legislation; that is, its failure to  address the proposed rule titled ‘‘Implementation of Regulations Required  Under Title XI of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008; Conduct  in Violation of the Act,’’ commonly  known as the GIPSA rule. This proposed rule has the potential to adversely affect  livestock producers  in  my State and around the country, as  well as consumers of meat products.  The House included a funding limitation on implementation of this rule in  its appropriations bill. That is not included in the Senate version of the bill.  I am a member of the agricultural appropriations subcommittee and believe  that, in this case, the House is correct.  Initially, this rule that the Department of Agriculture is proposing grew  out of the 2008 farm bill. As a Member  of the House of Representatives back  then, I was a member of the conference  committee that developed that  farm  bill. It directed the Department of Agriculture to issue regulations in five  very discrete areas.  In June 2010, the Department of Agriculture responded with the issuance of  its proposed GIPSA regulations that  clearly went way beyond the mandate  of that 2008 farm bill and way beyond  the Department of Agriculture’s authority under the Packers and Stockyards Act. The GIPSA rule as written  is exactly the type of burdensome regulation that was the focus of our President’s January 18 Executive order.  In addition to the Executive order,  the President promised to have a very  transparent and open administration in  regard to the development of rules. Unfortunately,  the process  surrounding  the GIPSA  rule has been  far  from  transparent. This  rule was proposed  with zero economic analysis from the  Department despite the major impacts  it could have on the agricultural economy.  For months, USDA denied that this  would be an economically significant  rule, until multiple private sector studies and overwhelming comments from  agricultural producers and others, such  as those in my home State of Kansas,  finally convinced the USDA this rule  would indeed have a significant economic impact. Private analysis at that  time indicated that these GIPSA regulations, if finalized as proposed, would  cost the U.S. meat and poultry industry nearly $1 billion.  Under this pressure, the Department  of Agriculture is now conducting an  economic analysis. While I certainly  welcome that economic analysis, I am  very  concerned  about whether  this  analysis will be made public before a  final rule  is announced and whether  the public will be able to analyze and  comment on the data and methodology  used by USDA to complete the study.  In fact, I asked the Secretary of Agriculture, during an agriculture appropriations subcommittee hearing, if he  would release that economic analysis  before the comment period concluded  or open a comment period after the  analysis  is  complete  so people  can  make comments based upon what the  economic analysis demonstrates. Certainly, in my view, the Secretary failed  on a number of occasions to answer my  question and give me that commitment  that the process would be open and  transparent and that a comment period  would occur.  I sincerely believe it is incumbent  upon this Congress to exercise its oversight discretion and direct the necessary  transparency  and  thoughtful  analysis that USDA to date has not  publicly provided. We need  time  to  study and comment on the methodology, and we need to make sure we get  these rules right if they are going to be  implemented. It would be irresponsible  to not adjust the rules to mitigate a  negative economic impact determined  by  the Department’s own  economic  analysis.  As I mentioned, the House included a  provision barring funding for the current proposed GIPSA regulations, and  USDA should be delayed  from going  forward until it can limit itself to the  five areas set forth in the farm bill—its  congressional  authority—and  until  public comments can occur regarding  that economic analysis. We ought not  have a final rule without the benefit of  the economic analysis. The Department of Agriculture should not just be  going  through  the motions because  there was insistence that an economic  analysis occur. We need to be able to  mitigate any negative impacts that we  learn from that economic analysis.  Madam President, I appreciate the  opportunity at this point in the day to  address an issue that is appropriate as  we discuss the agricultural appropriations bill throughout today. I look forward to being back on the floor later  today to offer an amendment to that  bill regarding watershed rehabilitation  and also at that time to speak in regard to what I view as some crazy ideas  that are proposed School Lunch Program regulations.

1886,6,2011-10-19,Mr. CARDIN.," Madam President,  I  rise to remember the 10th anniversary  of the anthrax attacks on our country.  During the weeks following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2011,  our Nation was exposed to chemical  warfare for the first time.  Two anthrax attacks were delivered  through our country’s postal system.  The first set of letters was mailed to  media outlets,  including ABC, CBS,  NBC, the National Enquirer, and the  New York Post in September.  Three weeks later, two other anthrax  letters were mailed to U.S. Senators—  Senator Daschle and Senator PATRICK  LEAHY. The letter to Senator LEAHY  never made it to Capitol Hill. The envelope addressed to Senator Daschle,  however, was opened on October 15 in  the Hart Senate Office Building in the  mailroom of the office I use today.  Emergency responders rushed to join  Capitol Police to evaluate the situation and determine the extent of contamination.  It was 10 years ago this week on October 17, 2001, the Capitol was evacuated. At that time I was a Member of  the House of Representatives. I remember the fear and trepidation all Americans felt in the days and weeks following September 11.  I take this time to honor the courage  of our Nation’s Federal employees. Two  made  the  ultimate  sacrifice,  dying  from the exposure of the deadly anthrax toxin at the postal facility that  handled all the mail that came to the  Senate and House offices. U.S. postal  workers Thomas L. Morris, Jr. and Joseph P. Curseen, Jr. gave the ultimate  sacrifice after being exposed to the infected Senate mail while they worked  in the Brentwood post office facility  here in Washington, DC.  Mr. Morris and Mr. Curseen were  Maryland  residents. Like  so many  other Federal employees, they went to  work every day, serving the American  people and trying to earn a living for  themselves and  their  families. Less  than a week after being exposed to the  deadly anthrax at the mail  facility,  both men died of their exposures.  The Brentwood postal facility, which  was shuttered  for months while the  building was disinfected, now proudly  bears their names, honoring two Federal employees who died doing their  jobs.  Literally thousands of other Federal  employees bravely went back to work,  making sure our government continued  to function in the most uncertain of  times.

Senator ALEXANDERand I had some  disagreements on things. But, man, I  think we agreed on 80 percent of this. I  think I had an 80-percent agreement—  I mean, that is Senator ENZI’s rule. He  has this 80-percent rule, which is that  we agree on 80 percent and we focus on  the 20 percent. I have a 64-percent rule  which is that 80 percent of the time we  agree on 80 percent. We see that Senator BENNETlaughed because he is proficient at math.  ",2011
1895,20,2011-10-19,Mr. HARKIN., I did not know if the  Senator from Kentucky wanted me to  yield to him for a question to get involved in the colloquy or the Senator  from North Carolina.  ,2011
1896,20,2011-10-19,Mr. BURR.,  I would  time.  ,2011
1897,20,2011-10-19,Mr. PAUL.," I do have a question. Several Senators on the committee have  said they would be happy to have meetings 24 hours a day. Why do we not  have a hearing on the bill? Why do we  not  invite teachers, superintendents,  and principals? There has been no hearing since the last election. There is no  reason why we cannot.  The other question we have and we  need to answer is: What do we say to  the American Association of School  Administrators, the National Association of Elementary School Principals,  the National Education Association,  the National School Boards Associalike my own  tion, and the National Association of  Secondary School Principals that say:  Let’s do not get pushed aside in this  race against the clock.  I am not opposed to much of what is  going to happen with the bill. I think  No Child Left Behind has many errors  and we can fix some of them. What I  am opposed to is the process of giving  us an 868-page bill yesterday and saying take it or leave it. We need more  time to read the bill. We need these organizations that are very interested in  education—it  is  their  livelihood—to  come in and make comments on this  bill. That would be an open-hearing  process. Anything else to me is disingenuous.  ",2011
1898,20,2011-10-19,Mr. HARKIN.," I will yield the floor  very soon. I say to my friend from Kentucky, I will say again: We put this bill  online 1 week ago Tuesday. Some of  the mail the Senator is talking about,  the letters came in after that because  they read the bill. I think the primary  objections on all those letters had to  do with teacher evaluations and what  we were going to do  in the bill on  teacher evaluations.  That is what we fixed in the managers’ amendment that we laid down  Monday morning. I am told—I have not  seen  it—but I am told the National  Education Association,  for  example,  has withdrawn from that letter because  of the fix we made. That is why we put  the bill online.  I said that earlier. We put it online.  A lot of objections came in. We modified it in the managers’ amendment to  move forward on that bill. That is exactly how we do it. I say to my friend  from Kentucky that we have had a  whole week.  Again, my friend filed 74 amendments  to the bill. How can you file 74 amendments if you haven’t read the bill? It  seems to me that if you file 74 amendments, you must have read the bill. I  assume  that  last week  the Senator  must have read the bill and then filed  74 amendments. You cannot have  it  both ways—say I haven’t read the bill,  but here are  74 amendments. That  doesn’t hold together logically.  Again, I will close on this note. The  Senator  from Colorado  is absolutely  right. We are here talking about process and who is up, who is down, all of  this kind of stuff. These teachers out in  America who are grappling with kids  who are under this burden of No Child  Left Behind and these AYPs, knowing  that  no matter  how much  they  progress their kids in 1 year, they are  still failing—this bill relieves them of  that, takes that yoke off them.  Every one of us has heard  from  teachers, parents, and administrators  that this No Child Left Behind is not  good, that it has to be fixed, and that  is what our bill does. How are we going  to change it and fix it if we are not  even allowed to meet?  Again, I hope the Senator from Kentucky will allow us to move forward in  this process and allow us to have our  amendment process. I say to my friend  he has another shot at this bill on the  floor. We will have committee, and we  will come to the  floor, and amendments will be offered on the floor. That  is the legislative process. No one person gets to dictate what is in this bill—  not me, not Senator ENZI, not the Senator from Kentucky. But all working  together  collaboratively  in a bipartisan fashion, I think we can move this  bill forward.  I yield the floor.  ",2011

1900,20,2011-10-19,Mr. BURR.," Mr. President, I say to  my colleagues that there were a lot of  blanket statements about one’s level of  participation. I have negotiated with  the chairman of this committee for 9  months on the reauthorization of our  emergency preparedness and biodefense  in this country. I know what negotiations are. I know what compromise is.  I know what commitment of time is. I  got this bill last Friday. I will find out  where it went online, or which copy  went online. My staff got this bill last  Friday. Yes, we have read it. We have  eight amendments, which is not as voluminous as Senator RANDPAUL; but  he gets that ability, as he gets the ability to be heard.  The minority’s only leverage in this  institution is to have an opportunity  to offer amendments and  to debate  them. I hear what the Senator is saying, but based upon the timeframe you  set—you don’t get  the privilege of  doing that when you have to deal with  the minority.  I know the chairman,  for whom I  have deep respect, has been here a long  time, and he knows it. This could have  been something very easily worked out  with communications on both sides of  the aisle. The fact is that, as I prepared  for this markup, I was told there was  an  agreement,  and  that  agreement  meant the chairman and ranking member were going to hold this bill intact.  There were going to be no exceptions  to it. They were going to vote to make  sure this bill didn’t change.  That doesn’t give one a lot of comfort, knowing what  the outcome of  amendments will be regardless of the  merit of the amendments. When we  started  this morning,  the chairman  was very gracious and let me say my  due for about 5 minutes. I am appreciative of that. I made it very clear to  Members at that time, the only thing I  asked them to do was weigh it on the  merits of  the amendment—my  first  amendment out of the chute, and it  was my best shot. I will say right here  on  the  floor,  it was a damn good  amendment. You know what. Lockstep  we went down the line, and they proved  to me that there is a deal.  You know, the next amendment was  offered by Senator FRANKEN. I was the  first one who stood up and said I disagree with the base text—it was offered  by both of them—but I will support it.  I am in year 17. Senator FRANKENsaid  he spent more time on this bill than  any bill ever.

1908,27,2011-10-19,Mr. BLUNT.," Mr. President, I join my  good friend in suggesting we would like  to see our colleagues come over here.  These  three appropriations bills are  being handled on the floor and they are  open to amendment. We haven’t had  appropriations bills on the floor of the  Senate in this way in quite a while. We  would  like  to get  these bills done.  Hopefully, we can get these bills done  maybe even this week and send them  on over to the House to talk about  these bills and their bills—3 bills, 16  amendments, and those aren’t all the  amendments we expect to be offered.  But we hope these amendments are offered today—a significant number—and  as the Senator from Maryland said earlier, we expect votes on some of these  amendments around 6 o’clock. Between  now and then, we look forward to a vigorous debate on as many of these as  the sponsors can come and debate. But  the Agriculture bill  that  I am  the  ranking member  of;  the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development  bill, which  the Senator  represents so well; and the Commerce-  State-Justice bill are all bills that are  moving forward in as close to a regular  process as we have had in a while.  We  look  forward  to  seeing  these  amendments  debated  this  afternoon  and some of them—as many of them as  possible—voted on this afternoon and  this evening.  ",2011

1910,27,2011-10-19,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, the  Senator  from Missouri  is  right. We  haven’t had a regular order for some  time. Leadership on both sides of the  aisle has created this fantastic opportunity. We are actually following a regular order on our appropriations. We  are actually following a regular order.  This is our opportunity to show we can  have a regular order, that we can move  our annual appropriations together in  a well-measured, well-paced, well-debated, and well-scrutinized way.  I  hope  our  colleagues who  have  amendments will come over. We know  Senators have  lots of opinions, and  opinions sometimes get translated into  amendments. But we  ask  our  colleagues now to show we can govern.  Come down, come to the floor and offer  these amendments and show we can  move three very important bills. The  one affecting transportation and housing is important to our economy. This  is a jobs bill, putting people to work  building highways, roads, and housing.  Agriculture is an important part of our  economy, and also Commerce, Justice,  and Science  is the  innovation committee, the trade committee, and the  advocacy  for  justice committee.

1914,27,2011-10-19,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, in a few  minutes, I want an opportunity to, for  clarification,  talk  about  the LRA,  troops who have gone over to northern  Uganda, including Rwanda and south  Sudan. I will wait now because a lot  will want to speak subject to these  amendments.  I wish to mention something I think  is significant because nobody is talking  about it. People have heard me talking  over the years about the overregulation being pursued by this administration in every area and what it is costing in terms of jobs.  I know I talk about this quite often,  but this time I am talking about a different area of overregulation. Most of  the time I am talking about what the  EPA is doing to destroy businesses in  this country. I do that because I am  the ranking member on the Environment and Public Works Committee,  which has jurisdiction over the environmental regulations and the EPA.  When we see what they are doing, it  is something that is more serious—or  at least as serious as all the deficits  that are coming out of this administration because it is chasing jobs overseas.  We will talk about that. This is a different area altogether.  We  talk about  the overregulation  that comes from the EPA in the EPW  Committee, where we have  jurisdiction. Today, I want to mention what is  going on in the USDA. In the 2008 farm  bill, the USDA was instructed to revisit and update the marketing regulations authorized to the Packers and  Stockyards Act of 1921. That particular  act is governed by the Grain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration, or GIPSA, as it is referred to.  That is all within the USDA.  The agency is supposed to regulate  and deal with the marketing practices  within the  livestock  industry.  I am  from Oklahoma, and it is a huge industry in Oklahoma. This provision of the  farm  bill was heavily  debated  and  amended when it was considered and,  ultimately, the USDA was instructed  to provide regulations  for a  few explicit objectives. Among  them were  broader  contract  cancellation  rights  for livestock growers; the disclosure of  foreseeable future necessary capital investment required for contract growers  within  their growing contracts; and  criteria for GIPSA to determine whether producers are treated with unreasonable  preference  or  advantage. The  House already considered this. In fact,  they have done their Agriculture appropriations bill.  Several months after the farm bill  was enacted—the one I referred to—  GIPSA released its preliminary rule,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:56 Oct 20, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G19OC6.046 S19OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011

1919,34,2011-10-19,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment is as follows:  On page 6, line 17, insert ‘‘: Provided further, That $8,000,000 of the amount made  available by this heading shall be transferred  to carry out the program authorized under  section 14 of the Watershed Protection and  Flood Prevention Act (16 U.S.C. 1012)’’ before  the period at the end.  ",2011
1920,34,2011-10-19,Mr. MORAN.," Madam President, the  amendment I am offering today was  one I discussed in the agricultural appropriations  subcommittee.  I  am  a  Member of that subcommittee and am  very interested in the topic of the appropriations for the Department of Agriculture.  This  amendment  would  transfer $8 million from the Department’s administrative account to the  Watershed  Rehabilitation  Program.  The Watershed Rehabilitation Program  is a bit broader than this, but basically  what we are talking about are PL–566  watershed structures. Across our country, more than 1,000 structures have  been built over a long period of time.  Many of them are up to 50 years old.  These structures are built for purposes  of flood control, for nutrient management, for conservation, wildlife habitat,  for  recreation.  Clearly,  these  structures have  been  an  important  component of the economy and well-  being of communities and people across  America for a long time.  In fact, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture, these PL–566  structures provide agricultural benefits  at their estimate of $404 million. These  benefits are things such as erosion control, animal waste management, water  conservation, water quality  improvement, irrigation efficiency, changes in  land use—things such as that.  There are also nonagricultural benefits which the NRCS estimates at $877  million in benefits. These are associated with recreation, fish and wildlife,  rural water supply, water quality, municipal and industrial water supply, incidental  recreation  uses.  Then,  of  course, what is particularly important  as we look at what has happened in our  country during this season, during this  year: flood control. Agricultural flood  control by NRCS estimates is a value  of $320 million; nonagricultural flood  protection, $425 million. We are talking  about  flood  control  structures  that  have benefited, for a number of reasons, about $2 billion. This amendment  does not create the opportunity to construct more of those structures. The  problem this amendment addresses is  that those structures are aging. As I  said earlier, many of them are nearly  50 years old.  In my view, it is very much like the  analogy we have with bridges. We focused some attention over the last several years on deteriorating bridges and  infrastructure in our highway system.  We know if we don’t provide the maintenance, the deterioration occurs, and  ultimately we  could have  a  catastrophe. That is what I am trying to address here, is my fear that in the absence of paying attention to the maintenance of these flood control structures, we run the potential of having a  disaster. Not only do the benefits accrue to agriculture and to communities  and water supply and recreation, but  the real thing here is about the loss of  property values and, more importantly,  the loss of life. In the absence of maintaining these structures, we run the  risk that the investment we have made  over decades begins to disappear. Not  only do we lose the value of the asset,  we potentially lose life by those who  would be harmed by the flooding that  will occur in the absence of these flood  control measures.  Therefore, a watershed rehabilitation  program was created years ago. The  problem in the funding we have today  in the appropriation bill before us is  there is no money, zero money in the  bill, to maintain these structures. So  ours is a very modest proposal to keep  the program ongoing of transferring $8  million  into that rehabilitation program to maintain those structures and  prevent bad  things  from happening.  This is probably woefully inadequate in  regard to the amount of resources that  should be devoted to this. Looking at  the bill and looking at the structure of  the bill and how we tried try to find  the right priorities and the balance  within the agriculture appropriations  subcommittee and at the full Appropriations  Committee, we  concluded  that we had the opportunity to at least  put $8 million into the program.  The watershed  rehabilitation  program is administered by the Natural  Resource  and Conservation Service,  and here is what it is described to do.  It assists project sponsors with rehabilitation of aging project dams. Only  dams installed under PL–566 and a couple of other programs are eligible. The  purpose of this program is to extend  the service life of dams and meet applicable safety and performance standards. Priority  is given by NRCS to  those structures that pose the highest  risk to life and property. Projects are  eligible when hazard to life and property increases due to downstream development and where there is a need  the  for  rehabilitation  to  extend  planned life of the structure.  What that is saying is in many of  these  instances where  the  structure  has been built, almost 50 years ago,  communities have been built downstream and  the dam becomes  even  more  important  to protect property  and life for that development. So we  are here trying make certain there is a  level of funding for repairing and replacing deteriorated components, repairing  damage  from  catastrophic  events, such as the floods we have experienced this year, and upgrading the  structures  to meet new dam  safety  laws or to even decommission a structure.  I would guess we are not going to  fund new structures here in this Congress  in this  fiscal environment. We  ought to at least take the responsibility of providing money to maintain  the structures that are there. In my  view, it is important that we do so. Unlike in past years, we can be assured  that the money we put into this bill  will go to the highest priority projects,  the dams that are in the most need of  repair and maintenance. There is no  opportunity for Members of Congress,  under our rules here in the Senate, to  earmark  these  dollars,  and  so  the  USDA, the Department of Agriculture,  through the Natural Resource and Conservation Service, will make those decisions.  We are not one of the States that has  the most dam structures, although it is  an  important aspect of maintaining  water in its proper place and to provide  wildlife habitat and conservation practices and improve the agricultural environment. Those structures are important to us, and we see this each and  every day.  In fact, for most of the time I have  been in Congress, we do an annual what  I call conservation tour. We look at the  role of the Department of Agriculture,  the private sector, wildlife and habitat  organizations, and how they partner  and come together to make good things  happen to  improve our environment.  This year we focused on water quality  and water quantity. Clearly this program of PL–566 structures is critical.  When I talk about that partnership,  it would be important for Members of  the Senate to know that this program  requires  a  35-percent  local match.  There is local money. The sponsors of  these projects, these dams across our  country, will have to  find  local resources in order to make that match.  I would ask the Senate to approve  the amendment I am offering today.  Again, it is something I raised in our  subcommittee and raised  in our  full  committee with the hopes we would be  able to find a satisfactory offset, and  from my view, the priority we place on  this program is one that is deserving of  Senate support.  I offer the amendment as I described.  I yield the floor.  ",2011

1923,41,2011-10-19,Mr. PRYOR.," I see that I have other  colleagues on the floor. I will only be a  couple of minutes.  Today I rise to oppose an amendment  offered by Senator MORAN, amendment  No. 815. I really do appreciate the intent of Senator MORAN’s amendment. I  actually support the intent of what he  is trying to do because he is trying to  support the Watershed Rehabilitation  Program.  While I am not opposed to that program, and I recognize that difficult decisions had to be made in order to meet  our statutory spending caps outlined in  the Budget Control Act, I regret to say  I cannot support the Senator’s amendment as it is written because its offset  comes from departmental administration which provides numerous essential  services to the USDA.  These cuts would force USDA to reduce their number of employees, which  would have a detrimental effect on the  Department and its operation. In fact,  Secretary Vilsack reached out to the  Agriculture  Appropriations  subcommittee staff to relay his serious  concerns.  These USDA employees provide essential services to some of the most  rural areas in the country, so I cannot  support the amendment that would, in  effect, reduce services to rural America.  On top of that, it is important for my  colleagues to understand that the level  for departmental administration is already over $13 million below the fiscal  year 2010 level and $7 million below the  President’s request.  Although I definitely support the watershed rehabilitation program, I certainly hope Senator KOHLand Senator  MORAN can find a good offset that is  agreeable to the majority of us. Still, I  must oppose this amendment and urge  other Senators to oppose it as well.  With that, I yield the floor.  ",2011

1944,55,2011-10-19,Mr.  SESSIONS.," Mr. President,  I  would  like  to  speak on amendment  number 812, which would prohibit the  Patent  and Trademark Office  from  using funds to implement Section 37 of  the America Invents Act, more commonly known as the ‘‘Medco Fix.’’  The Medco fix was a bailout for a  well-connected law firm—WilmerHale—  and its malpractice insurer to the tune  of $214 million, and the essence of special interest legislation that will result  in increased costs for the government,  hospitals and consumers. I offered an  amendment  to  the America  Invents  Act to strike this special interest fix  and it was narrowly defeated by a vote  of 51 to 47.  This  saga  began  in  2001,  when  WilmerHale apparently missed a routine deadline  for  submitting  to  the  PTO a patent term extension (PTE) application on behalf of its client Medco.  The PTO denied the application, concluding it was not filed in a timely  manner. Legal deadlines like this exist  for a reason. They provide certainty  not only to the litigants in a particular  matter but also to the public. Every  day in courts across America where a  deadline  is missed the result  is the  same. Claim is dismissed the remedy  available to the harmed party is a malpractice claim against the offending  attorney.  Yet,  in  the  10  years  since  WilmerHale’s  malpractice,  Medco  never sued the law firm. Instead, in  February 2011, the parties agreed to a  settlement whereby the firm would pay  Medco $214 million, of which $99 million will be paid by the firm’s malpractice insurer.  WilmerHale also  immediately paid  $18 million up front to cover Medco’s  litigation and lobbying expenses over  the past decade. The settlement was  tied to their success in getting either  the PTO or Congress to grant an extension of Medco’s patent  term before  June 2015, when the extension period  overturning the PTO decision would  otherwise expire.  Both the company and its law firm  have  spent millions  of  dollars  and  many  years  lobbying  Congress  to  change the rules and to politically fix  their legal mistake. Unfortunately—in  my view—they succeeded.  One of the many reasons I oppose  this special interest fix is because I believe it is unnecessary, unwise and dangerous for Congress to interfere with  ongoing litigation, which is what happened here. It goes against historical  precedent and sound policy  for Congress to directly interfere with active  judicial proceedings on behalf of one  party over another. Here, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Virginia had already ordered the PTO  to  ‘‘consider’’ Medco’s  application  timely filed and adopt an interpretation of the word ‘‘date’’ in the statute  that  includes a  ‘‘next business day’’  construction  rather  than  ‘‘calendar  day’’ as the PTO argued. Although the  PTO did not appeal the decision, a generic company, APP Pharmaceuticals,  intervened in the case with an appeal  to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. At the time that Congress was  considering the America Invents Act,  oral  arguments  before  the  appeals  court already had been scheduled for  just a few weeks later. The court had  not even had the chance to hear arguments when  some of my colleagues  were arguing that the Medco fix merely  enshrined in statute the holdings of the  courts.  However, it is my understanding that  APP—the  intervening party—pointed  out to the appeals court that even if  the Medco fix applied to this appeal,  according to the language of the America Invents Act, it would not take effect for one year from the date of enactment. Indeed, the America Invents  Act provides  that, unless otherwise  specified, all provisions are to take effect one year after the date of enactment and no special effective date is  provided for the Medco fix. Should we  now expect them to come to Congress  for a fix for lobbying malpractice?  Given this, the Federal Circuit postponed oral argument, ordered the parties to file briefs regarding the impact  of the effective date, and then rescheduled the argument for November 15th. I  would point out to my colleagues who  so forcefully insisted on this fix that  the Federal Circuit’s  actions  demonstrate that this is by no means merely technical. The court  is reviewing  this very question of law, both for effectiveness and to determine whether  Congress has the power to revive a patent once it has expired and entered the  public domain.  As I have said many times before,  this body should not be intruding on  the jurisdiction of the judicial branch.  Today, I am offering an amendment to  right this wrong and to allow the Federal Circuit, without interruption, to  fulfill its constitutional role in deciding a pure question of law.  Mr. President, there is no unanimous  consent, I know, to bring up amendment No. 812, which I have submitted.  It is a very important amendment. It is  something  I will  insist on  through  every appropriate power an individual  Senator has to get an amendment to be  voted on. Hopefully it will be coming  up tomorrow or the next day. Let me  again summarize it briefly.  Amendment 812 would prohibit the  Patent  and Trademark Office  from  using funds to implement section 37 of  the America Invents Act, more commonly known as the Medco fix. When  the patent bill moved through the Senate and the House—that took a decade—efforts were made to reverse a decision by the Patent and Trademark  Office that had declared a major Boston law firm had failed to file a document in time to preserve a patent for  their client Medco and, as a result of  that, Medco was  to  lose  its patent  sooner than otherwise would be the  case. Generic manufacturers would be  able to manufacture the drug and it  was asserted that it would cost $214  million as a result of this error.  If a doctor makes an error, the doctor gets sued for malpractice. If lawyers make errors, they get sued  for  malpractice. They have malpractice insurance. Apparently they had some insurance.  At any rate, it appears millions of  dollars, or hundreds of millions of dollars, were set aside for lobbying and  other efforts to politically reverse the  patent office during a time while the  matter was litigated in court. When  the patent bill came up a few months  ago it was contended that this is the  only vehicle to fix this problem and we  needed to fix it. The House voted not to  put it in their bill. Then somehow a  new vote was obtained, and by the narrowest of margins the House put it in  and it came to the Senate.  I had been objecting for a decade, and  I objected and others objected, and we  had a vote and by the margin of 51 to  47 it was decided not to amend the patent bill that the House had passed and  to pass it just as the House did, although many  people  told me  they  agreed with me that this Medco fix intervening in ongoing litigation should  not occur, but changing the patent bill  would send it back to the House and  endanger the passage of the bill.  I was disappointed then. But what we  discovered is that the litigation continues. It is now before the U.S. Court  of Appeals. The Court of Appeals  is  taking  arguments  on  a number  of  issues that relate to this. It is a very  real problem. It is a matter that ought  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:51 Oct 20, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A19OC6.029 S19OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011
1945,62,2011-10-19,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, in 1737,  Marguerite D’Youville, a young widow  and mother of three, founded the Sister  of Charity in Quebec, Canada. Despite  her own misfortune and poverty, she  devoted her life to caring for those less  fortunate—the poor, the sick, and the  orphaned.  Since that time, the Grey Nuns, as  the sisters are known, have expanded  their work of compassion throughout  Canada,  the United  States,  South  America,  and  the  Caribbean  with  schools, hospitals, and orphanages. St.  Marguerite D’Youville, whom  Pope  John XXIII called the ‘‘Mother of Universal Charity,’’ was canonized in 1990,  the first native-born Canadian saint.  My home State has been blessed by  the works of St. Marguerite and her  followers. On November 20, 1878, three  Grey Nuns stepped off a train in Lewiston, ME, equipped with  little more  than caring hearts and determination.  Within 2 weeks, they opened the first  bilingual school in that largely Franco-  American city, with 200 children arriving for the first day of class. Within 6  months, they opened an orphanage.  The Hospital of the Sisters of Charity  they founded was often referred to as  the ‘‘Sisters’ Hospital’’ or the ‘‘French  Hospital,’’ but  the Grey Nuns welcomed all. It was the first hospital in  the twin cities of Lewiston-Auburn and  the first Catholic hospital in Maine.  Fees for care in the hard-working mill  community were low and were often  paid in loaves of bread, bolts of cloth,  or bushels of apples, which the sisters  gladly accepted.  A major expansion of the hospital in  1902 gave Lewiston the two magnificent  domes that grace the city’s skyline. In  1910,  the name was changed  to St.  Mary’s General Hospital. The growth of  the hospital was well underway, with  the latest medical innovations and a  bilingual School of Nursing.  Today, St. Mary’s Health System includes a 233-bed acute care facility; a  strong  physician network,  an  independent  living  center,  and  occupational health services that reach out to  businesses throughout the region. St.  Mary’s D’Youville Pavilion is one of  the largest nursing homes in New England and a national model  for elder  care.  On October 24, St. Mary’s General  Hospital will honor the Sisters of Charity, past and present, for more than 130  years of healing for the body and the  soul. I rise today to join in that tribute. Through the tender care and willing sacrifice of the Grey Nuns, the  words of St. Marguerite d’Youville,  ‘‘We  shall continue  to  love and  to  serve,’’ still resonate today.∑  f  FOOD DAY  ∑",2011
1946,62,2011-10-19,Mr.  BARRASSO.,"  Mr.  President,  today I wish to submit for the RECORD  an article written by Ann Wittman, executive director of the Wyoming Beef  Council and published October 8, 2011,  in  the Wyoming Livestock Journal.  The article’s title  is  ‘‘Food Day Includes Gravy.’’  As Ann correctly points out, Monday,  October 24, 2011, is being billed as Food  Day with events planned across the Nation. Here in Washington, DC, the National Archives will be hosting a Food  Day open house in conjunction with  their  ‘‘What’s Cooking, Uncle Sam?’’  exhibit. Of note, the open house  is  being supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Food and  Drug Administration along with the  primary Food Day sponsor, the Center  for Science in the Public Interest.  It is the Center for Science in the  Public Interest’s agenda Ann calls into  question. As she writes, the group’s  goal  is to  ‘‘encourage people around  the country to sponsor or participate  in activities that encourage Americans  to ‘eat real’ and support healthy, affordable food grown in a sustainable,  humane way.’’  The question must be asked, who is  defining what is or what is not sustainable, healthy, and humane? In the article she points out behind the innocent  name of the ‘‘Center for Science in the  Public Interest’’ are groups with very  extreme positions such as the Humane  Society of the United States, People  for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,  Farm Animal Rights Movement, and  FBI-designated  terrorist  groups,  including the Animal Liberation Front.  These  groups  push  radical  environmental, animal rights, and vegan positions and lifestyles that have very little to do with either science or public  interest.  The USDA and FDA should not align  themselves with  fringe  groups who  push ideology over science. I commend  Ann for her research and wise judgment  in  exposing  special  interest  masquerading as public interest.  The material follows.  FOODDAYINCLUDESGRAVY  (By Ann Wittmann, Executive Director,  Wyoming Beef Council)  When I started working at the Wyoming  Beef Council more than a decade ago, I had  fewer gray hairs, fewer wrinkles and enthusiasm that might have been referred to as effervescent. My ideals were grand, my trust  was large and I had great faith in the public  to  seek and gravitate  toward  the  truth.  Don’t get me wrong, my enthusiasm has not  waned, anyone who works with me or in the  continental vicinity of me knows that I am  passionate about my work, but the direction  and means of expressing my enthusiasm has  become more focused over the years. It’s become less like an exploding soda pop and  more like simmering gravy.  Several weeks ago I read with great interest an invitation to work with an organization called Center for Science in the Public  Interest (CSPI) to participate in and facilitate ‘‘Food Day’’ activities throughout Wyoming. The invite billed ‘‘Food Day’’ as a national event on Oct. 24, 2011 to ‘‘encourage  people around the country to sponsor or participate in activities that encourage Americans to ‘eat real’ and support healthy, affordable food grown in a sustainable, humane  way.’’  Had I received that offer 10 years ago, I  would have been shocked to discover the true  message and motive behind the effort. After  all, the event was created by the Center for  Science  in  the Public  Interest, and who  among us doesn’t believe that science should  be in the public interest? My older, wiser  simmering brain prevailed, however, and  held back enthusiasm pending further investigation.  Research into the event listed partner organizations as Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, Farm Animal Rights  Movement and the notorious Humane Society of the United States. Similar to the CSPI  group,  these organizations have  feel-good  names that serve to mislead the public. Most  of us are aware that the Humane Society of  the United States (HSUS) is a national nonprofit organization with a $200 million budget raised under the guise of funding pet shelters, but that spends all but one percent of  that budget on efforts to eliminate animal  agriculture. The other two groups, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine  (PCRM) and Farm Animals Rights Movement (FARM) may not be as familiar. PCRM,  in spite of its name, has a very small number  of physicians as members and has direct ties  to PETA, as well as several FBI-designated  terrorist groups including Animal Liberation  Front (ALF) and Stop Huntingdon Animal  Cruelty (SHAC). FARM is a national nonprofit organization promoting a vegan lifestyle through public education and grassroots activism to end the use of animals for  food.  As cautious as I am about jumping to conclusions, less than 60 seconds into my research I began to think ‘‘Food Day’’ was not  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:44 Oct 20, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G19OC6.034 S19OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011
1947,6,2011-10-27,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield such  time as he may consume to a most active member of our committee, the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL).  ",2011
1948,6,2011-10-27,Mr. PASCRELL.," Good morning.  I come to the floor today in support  of H.R. 674, which will repeal a burden  on government contractors, particularly small businesses.  I opposed the enactment of the 3 percent withholding when a Republican  Congress and a Republican administration enacted it because I knew that it  would hurt the economic engines of our  economy.  The repeal of this requirement will  free up small businesses’ cash flow, increasing their ability to add jobs and  bid on new projects. This is only a very  small part of a jobs plan that could  help to reduce unemployment and wage  stagnation.  The majority has not allowed a vote  on known job-creating measures such  as the infrastructure bank or funding  for our first responders and teachers,  so I would imagine that that’s not very  important,  those  items. Rather,  the  majority has decided to promote their  ‘‘False Fifteen’’ bills that attack clean  air, safe water, and consumer safety.  Be prepared, America, to eat poison.  Not only do independent economists  state that these bills do not create  jobs, a recent report found that the so-  called  ‘‘economically  stifling’’  regulatory atmosphere is not as bad as they  say. The report says this:  ‘‘Obama’s  White House has approved fewer regulations than George W. Bush at this  same point in their tenures, and the  costs of those rules haven’t reached the  annual peak set in fiscal 1992 under  President Bush’s  father,’’ President  Bush I. You would never think that by  listening  to  the propaganda on  the  other side of the aisle. We’ve overregulated—supposedly—and we’ve  caused  businesses to spend so much money on  these regulations. But again, when we  look at the facts, this is not true.  Eat your words. Even former Reagan  Treasury official Bruce Bartlett quoted  the Wall Street Journal saying, ‘‘The  main reason U.S. companies are reluctant to step up hiring is scant demand,  rather than uncertainty over government policies.’’ So you can grow as  many horns as you want onto  the  President. Once again, look at the facts  and the statistics: more regulations at  this point when former President Bush  was the President, Bush II.  It is ironic that the majority is adjusting health reform to pay for this  legislation. You condemn the health  act, and then you take the money from  the health act to pay for this legislation. That is a Ponzi scheme if I’ve  ever heard one. The majority already  voted to repeal health reform, yet to  pay for this legislation—which is a separate piece of  legislation—health reform must be in place for 10 years. How  do you do that? They get rid of the  health care act—well, they’re trying to  thank  the genanyway—and yet they use every dime  for the first 10 years to pay for the bill.  b0940  How do you do that? I’m anxious to  see how you do this.  Just as their 2012 budget was paid for  by health reform savings, and we’ve  discussed  this  in  the  budget  committee, this bill is again paid for by the  health reform which they want to annihilate. If the majority is against the  health reform bill, perhaps they should  stop making their agenda so dependent  upon it.  While I support H.R. 674, we cannot  pat ourselves on the back and claim  victory that this is a victory for jobs.  Congress must do much more.  ",2011
1949,6,2011-10-27,Mr. HERGER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. PAULSEN), a distinguished  member of the Ways and Means Committee.  ",2011
1950,6,2011-10-27,Mr. PAULSEN.,"  I  tleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I also rise in favor of  H.R. 674, a bill that will repeal this ill-  conceived 3 percent withholding rule  for all government contractors, including private hospitals that accept Medicare or Medicaid payments and those  who provide even lunches for schools.  This is one area in which Republicans  and Democrats are working together,  as even President Obama singled out  this provision as burdensome to our  Nation’s job creators. The President, in  his jobs plan, he proposed delaying this  rule. The very fact that this rule continues to be delayed and has not been  implemented since being first created  in 2005 just tells you how bad of an idea  it truly is. But we shouldn’t just delay  it; we should eliminate it and repeal it  immediately.  I’ve spoken with many small businesses in my district that will be negatively impacted by this law because the  profit margin for many of these companies that have government contracts is  right around 3 percent.  One Minnesota company, Valley Paving, says that withholding 3 percent,  the new  3 percent withholding  law  would be catastrophic on their balance  sheet, meaning  that covering costs,  paying bills, and just covering operating costs would be a challenge. And  as they point out, during these hard  economic  times,  withholding more  money from our small businesses like  themselves would be that they most  likely would not be able to update  their equipment, not grow as fast, and  not be able to hire more people.  Mr. Speaker, this goes against everything that Washington should be doing,  giving our employers certainty to create more jobs. This law needs to be repealed.  Another contractor  in my district,  Hardrives,  Incorporated, pointed out  the Federal Government does not need  to be playing banker with our earned  income.  This law may have sounded like a  good idea on paper but, in practice, it  will be disastrous. This is made evident  by the cost of the program itself. Implementing it for the Department of  Defense alone  is  estimated  to  cost  about $17 billion over 5 years.  And here’s the irony, Mr. Speaker.  The program is forecast to bring in a  little over $11 billion across the whole  spectrum of government. So the program is going to cost more to implement than it will take in.  I strongly urge support of this commonsense approach and bipartisan approach on adopting this bill. The President supports the pay-for.  I thank the member of the Ways and  Means Committee, Mr. HERGER, and I  ask for its support.  ",2011

1953,6,2011-10-27,Mr. HERGER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to reference the Statement of Administration Policy on this  bill. In this letter from the President,  just to quote from it, ‘‘The Administration supports passage of H.R. 674, which  would repeal a 3 percent withholding  on certain payments made to private  contractors  by Federal, State,  and  local government entities.’’  ‘‘The effect of the repeal of the withholding requirement would be to avoid  a decrease in cash flow to these contractors, which would allow them to  retain these funds and use them to create jobs and pay suppliers.’’  Mr. Speaker, jobs are the number one  priority of the American people, and  jobs should be the number one priority  of this Congress. Many initiatives that  are billed as ‘‘creating jobs’’ are controversial. This is not. We’re repealing  a tax that hurts small businesses and  that will cost the government more to  implement than it collects. This is a  win-win-win  for businesses, workers,  local public services, and taxpayers.  I urge all Members to vote to repeal  the 3 percent withholding tax and create new jobs now.  With that, I yield back the balance of  my time.  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT  ANDBUDGET,  Washington, DC, October 25, 2011.

More meaningfully,  though,  this concludes another week where a nightmare is about  to come true for our constituents. This  is another week without a paycheck for  a lot of Americans. It might be the  week that their unemployment benefits expire. This might be the day that  someone shuts down their small business and closes the doors for the last  time. This might be the week that the  foreclosure  notice  is  executed  and  someone  loses their home. This has  been a bad week for a lot of Americans.  It’s been a bad time for a lot of Americans. But what they have lost is not  simply their job, not simply their business, not simply their health insurance  or their pension. Many of our neighbors  have lost their basic faith that America is fair.  Mr. Speaker, 50 percent—50 percent—  of the American people recently surveyed said the American Dream was either dead or on life support. They see  in the halls of big institutions, they see  on Wall Street and they see  in the  Halls of Congress a basic sense that  America is not fair anymore, that the  basic deal that if you work as hard as  you can, give as much as you can and  do as much as you can that you can go  as far as your abilities will take you,  too many of our constituents no longer  believe that.  My motion makes what I believe is  an  improvement to a good bill. I’m  going to support this bill that says  that no small business person should  have to make an interest-free loan to  the Federal Government to do business  with the government. I think that’s exactly right. But here’s the  improvement it makes. It recognizes that some  who would take advantage of that provision are taking advantage of our tax  system and not paying their fair share.  When I say  ‘‘not paying their fair  share,’’ I’m not talking about policy or  arguing about tax rates. I’m talking  about someone who is delinquent on  their taxes and cheating the rest of us.  So when someone looks at their pay  envelope this afternoon and sees what’s  taken out in FICA and Federal withholding tax, they’re paying their fair  share. Some like it, many do not, but  they’re paying their fair share. Why  should it be that someone who is not  paying their fair share to support this  country should take advantage of this  very good bill? I say they shouldn’t.  So my improvement to this bill is  very simple. If you run a barber shop or  a software company or a delicatessen  or  a manufacturing  plant,  you  no  longer have to make an interest-free  loan to the government to do business  with  the government.  I agree with  that, and I salute the authors of the  bill. But if you are delinquent on your  taxes,  if you haven’t paid your  fair  share, if you are cheating the rest of  the community, then you may not take  advantage of this opportunity.  This amendment  is not  just about  improving the revenue flow to the Federal Government.  It’s about making  the country a little more fair again.  It’s about saying that those who follow  the rules, our small businesses, our  middle class citizens, those who follow  the rules can take advantage of the  law, but those who do not follow the  rules may not take advantage of the  law. I think the American people want  to see that in big hospitals and insurance companies; I think they want to  see that on Wall Street; and I think  they want to see it right here on the  floor of this Chamber.  So let’s cast a vote today not just for  an improvement to this bill, but let’s  make America a little more fair.

1964,27,2011-10-27,Mr. CALVERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and honor Howard H. ‘‘Tim’’ Hays  who recently passed away at the age of 94.  He will be deeply missed.  Mr. Hays spent 51 years at the Riverside  Press Enterprise, the sixth largest newspaper  in the state of California. Before coming to the  newspaper, Mr. Hays was an FBI Special  Agent during World War II. In 1946, he joined  the paper as an Assistant Editor and also  passed the California bar exam. The Riverside  Press Enterprise wrote an article detailing the  many accomplishments of Mr. Hays and the  incredible contributions he made to the newspaper, the community and the country.  [Oct. 14, 2011]  FORMERP–E PUBLISHERANDEDITORTIM  HAYSDIES  Howard H. ‘‘Tim’’ Hays, Jr., the Harvard-  educated  lawyer who chose a newspaperman’s life and led what became The Press-  Enterprise  into national prominence as a  Pulitzer Prize-winning advocate of open government and defender of the First Amendment, died Friday in St. Louis. He was 94.  Mr. Hays had been struggling with Alzheimer’s disease, his son Tom Hays said Friday. He said his father died in the afternoon  at Barnes-Jewish Hospital following a brief  acute illness.  Mr. Hays spent 51 years at The Press-Enterprise. He was an FBI special agent during  World War II and joined the newspaper as assistant editor in 1946. He passed the bar the  same year but never practiced law.  His subsequent roles included editor, co-  publisher, publisher and chairman. He continued as chairman until 1997, when The  Press-Enterprise was sold to the A.H. Belo  Co., ending 67 years of family ownership of  the Riverside-based newspaper.  The news organization’s five-story office  on Fourteenth Street was named in 2006 as  the Howard H. ‘‘Tim’’ Hays Media Center.  ‘‘Tim was a rarity, a man whose moral  compass  was  set  on  true,’’  said Mel  Opotowsky, the former managing editor of  The Press-Enterprise.  ‘‘That  is especially  important as a newspaper owner because of  the obligation as a public trust. There are  many  instances of Tim’s beneficence, not  only to his employees, but to his readers and  to principles of quality journalism.’’  Mr. Hays once joked that his choice of  journalism over law and his ‘‘semi-meteoric  rise’’ at the newspaper were due to  ‘‘diligence, and the fact that my father was co-  owner.’’  Courtly, soft-voiced and with a penchant  for remembering anyone’s name, from civic  leaders to cleaning crews in the hallways of  his newspaper, Mr. Hays’ personality contrasted sharply with flamboyant news-executive contemporaries. His memos were to his  ‘‘Fellow Employees.’’  But his reserved manner was matched with  a steely resolve.  He stood up to pressure and confrontation  to lead his newspaper to a Pulitzer Prize. He  took two open-government cases to the U.S.  Supreme Court, winning both.  Media attorneys use shorthand to refer to  two landmark cases won by the newspaper,  Press-Enterprise One and Two.  In January 1984, the newspaper won a case  establishing the public’s right to attend jury  selection in criminal trial proceedings. In a  1986 case, the court asserted the right of the  public to attend pre-trial hearings in criminal cases with few exceptions.  Mr. Hays oversaw publication of a series of  articles in 1967 that exposed malpractice in  the  conservatorship  program  for  Agua  Caliente Indians in Palm Springs. Editorials  combined with more than 100 stories, mostly  written by reporter George Ringwald, earned  the newspaper the Pulitzer Prize for meritorious public service in 1968. (Ringwald died  in 2005.)  During the newspaper’s reporting of that  issue, a judge who was under investigation  became infuriated by a Press-Enterprise editorial and ordered Mr. Hays arrested.  The publisher stood his ground and was not  jailed.  Mr. Hays also stood by his reporters, even  as advertisers took their business away in  protest over investigative pieces.  Despite national  recognition, Mr. Hays  kept his community at the foreground of his  work. He was among the civic leaders who  worked to get a University of California  campus  established  here.  UC  Riverside  opened in 1954.  ‘‘Tim had a very active mind that saw beyond the ordinary but was able to bring it  down to earth,’’ said his former executive  secretary, Jean Wingard. ‘‘He was an excellent newsman, and had the respect of those  who worked with him and for him.’’  Mr. Hays established the Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture in 1966, which was underwritten in 1998 by a $100,000 endowment after  the newspaper was sold.  The free lectures, open to the public, featured leaders in news media, including retired Washington Post Executive Editor Ben  Bradlee; Gene Roberts, former managing editor of the New York Times; and W. Thomas  Johnson, who was then president of Cable  News Network.  Mr. Hays also undertook the cause of preserving the Mission Inn.  He and other  civic  leaders maintained  their effort during a seven-year stretch in  which the state and national historic landmark in downtown Riverside was closed—at  one time surrounded by a chain-link fence.  Several attempts to reopen the Inn failed.  Some suggested the land was a prime spot  for a parking lot. In 1992, Duane Roberts  bought the hotel and invested millions of  dollars in renovations.  The Press-Enterprise under Mr. Hays also  quietly helped to underwrite local cultural  and arts organizations.  ‘‘I’m not married to any cause,’’ Mr. Hays  once said.  ‘‘I believe in generosity to the  community in which you live. I think you  can contribute more with time and energy  than with dollars. But I guess the money can  be pretty dandy, too.’’  Retired  appellate  court  Justice  John  Gabbert said Mr. Hays, similar to his brothers, developed his sense of community engagement early in life.  ‘‘He was motivated by the very strong  civic background that he probably inherited  from his father,’’ Gabbert said Friday. ‘‘They  were all there, out in the community, making it better.’’  Contemporaries of Mr. Hays said he was  less  likely to deliver a  fiery speech, and  more likely to argue his points over lunch or  in a casual conversation. Former state Sen.  Robert Presley said each time he would meet  Mr. Hays at the same downtown Riverside  restaurant, the publisher would prod him for  support of downtown Riverside projects.  ‘‘He didn’t seem to have a lot of ego, although he could be vigorous and persuasive  in his arguments,’’ Presley said Friday from  Sacramento.  ‘‘He was  a  very  special  person,’’  said  Marcia McQuern who worked for Hays at The  Press-Enterprise and eventually became the  paper’s publisher. ‘‘He had a true journalist’s  heart. He always tried to  live up to his  standards and ideals.’’  McQuern remembered Hays being well tied  into the community. So much so that he  often knew what was going on before his reporters did.  ‘‘I would come to him with a story and he’d  say, ‘You finally found that out,’’’ she said.  ‘‘But he never would kill anything.’’  Even when it may have been unpopular  among the community leaders he mingled  with.  ‘‘He took a lot of heat. He really stuck by  the newsroom. That’s where his heart was,’’  she said.  McQuern remembered one instance where  the paper wanted the name behind a large  anonymous donation to UC Riverside.  ‘‘We fought for access,’’ she said. ‘‘He let  us go fight for the information. We were  about to file suit and he finally admitted it  was him.’’  Howard H. ‘‘Tim’’ Hays, Jr. was born in  Chicago on June 2, 1917, the son of Howard H.  Hays, Sr. and Margaret Mauger Hays. He  came to Riverside with his parents in 1924.  A graduate of Riverside Polytechnic High  School, he was editor of the school newspaper, Poly Spotlight, during his senior year.  Mr. Hays earned a bachelor’s degree in social sciences at Stanford University, graduating in 1939.  In 1942, he received a law degree from Harvard Law School. After his service with the  FBI, he briefly served as a reporter at the  San Bernardino Sun before joining the family newspaper and beginning his leadership  role in American journalism.  Mr. Hays moved to St. Louis part time in  1989, and began living there full time after  his retirement  from The Press-Enterprise,  his son Tom said.  In a message read at the 2007 dedication of  the news building named after him, Mr. Hays  noted that he still read every day the newspaper that he had led for so long.  Survivors include wife Susie Hays of St.  Louis, sons Bill Hays of Corona Del Mar and  Tom Hays of New York City, and brother  Dan Hays of Riverside. His brother, William  H. Hays, died earlier this year. Mr. Hays’  first wife, Helen Hays Yeager, died two years  earlier, to the day, of Mr. Hays’ death.  Said Tom Hays, ‘‘He lived a very long and  productive and fortunate life, and he died  very peacefully,  so we are  thankful  for  that.’’  Mr. Hays will always be remembered for  his incredible work ethic, generosity, love of  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

1965,34,2011-10-27,Ms. HIRONO.," Mr. Speaker, October is Filipino American History Month, giving us opportunity to remember the storied history of Filipinos in Hawaii.  From the barrios of the Philippines, Filipinos  boarded ships and sailed across the Pacific.  Upon reaching Hawaii, they worked on sugarcane plantations where  life was hard but  filled with hope and the dream of a brighter future.  Today, generations later, Filipinos represent  the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority  in the islands. Through hard work, they continue to make steady strides in all professions.  They are our doctors and lawyers, our teachers, small business owners, and community  leaders. The next generation of Filipino Americans will build upon this legacy of accomplishment.  I had  the pleasure of meeting with  members of the Kabatak Filipino Club at the  University of Hawaii—Maui College in Kahului.  Their primary goal is to raise an awareness of  Filipino culture and to encourage the recruitment, retention, and achievement of Filipino  students on the Maui campus. This is a noble  endeavor.  For more than a century, Filipino Americans  have left their mark on America. Let us reflect,  celebrate, and honor this cherished heritage.  f  HONORING  THE  HIGH  SCHOOL  TENNIS TEAM  ROCK  LADY  BRIDGE  BRUINS  HON.

1970,41,2011-10-27,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to recognize Tommie Speights, upon his  retirement  from  the Florida Department of  Transportation (FDOT) as District 3 Public Information Director, after 22 years of service to  the State of Florida.  Born in Panama City, Florida and raised in  Marianna, Mr. Speights worked in a number of  different capacities prior  to  joining FDOT. A  true patriot, he chose to serve his country during the Vietnam era and wore the uniform of  the United States Army. Upon being honorably  discharged  from  the  Army,  he  attended  Chipola Junior College and Florida A&M University. After completing his studies in Broadcast Journalism, he worked as a  television  news reporter  for CBS affiliate WTVY–TV 4  News  in Dothan, Alabama. During his 15  years there, he received several awards, including one  from  the Associated Press  for  ‘‘Best Investigative Reporting.’’  In 1989, Mr. Speights began his impressive  career with FDOT as Public Information Director for District 3. This district includes 16 counties in Northwest Florida, stretching from Jefferson County in the east to Escambia County  in the west. For the last 22 years he has devoted his professional life to helping those in  need. Serving others brings him great satisfaction, and co-workers and supervisors alike applaud Mr. Speights for his dependability and  unwavering commitment.  My wife Vicki and I wish him; his wife, the  former Lillie Kendall of Marianna; their three  children, Sheilah, Ron, and Marisa; and four  grand-children, Alexus, NyAsia, Amarion, and  Kensley all the best.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States  Congress, I am honored to congratulate Mr.  Speights on his retirement and thank him for  his service to Northwest Florida and our great  nation.

1971,13,2011-11-09,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President, I  rise today to oppose the Senate Joint  Resolution 6, which was brought under  the Congressional Review Act—about  which I wish to talk—to disapprove the  FCC’s open Internet rules, such as they  are.  Americans want the Internet to be  free and open to them. They want to go  where they want to go, see what they  want to see, do what they want to do  on the Internet. They don’t want to  have somebody blocking them or to  have gatekeepers. They want it to be a  nice, open forum for them. They care  about the Internet. Everyone uses it.  They want to be able to develop new  businesses, and they want to read and  watch video. They want to reach out to  friends and  family and  community.  And they want to do it online. They  want to do all of these things on the  Internet—without having to ask permission from their broadband provider.  The FCC has promulgated balanced  rules that let Americans do all of these  things, and keep the Internet open and  keep the Internet free.  Let us be clear from the outset. No  matter how S.J. Res. 6 is dressed up in  language that suggests it will promote  openness and freedom, it will not do  that. The resolution is misguided. It  will add uncertainty, in fact, into the  economy, and it will hinder small businesses dependent upon fair broadband  access, where otherwise they might be  put in a slower lane. They want to be  in a fast lane. They want to be able to  compete with other parts of the country. This resolution will, in fact, undermine innovation. It will hamper investment in digital commerce. It will imperil the openness and  freedom that  has been the hallmark of the Internet  from the very start.  The FCC’s rules were the product of  very hard work, consensus, and compromise. The  agency had  extensive  input from stakeholders from all quarters. They opened up and said send in  your comments. In fact, they had written input from more than 100,000 commenters. About 90 percent of those filing  supported  the adoption of open  Internet rules. On top of this, the rules  are based on longstanding and widely  accepted  open  Internet  principles,  which were first articulated during the  second Bush administration.  These rules do three basic things.  First, they impose a transparency obligation on providers of broadband Internet  service.  This means  that  all  broadband providers are  required  to  publicly disclose to consumers accurate  information  regarding  the network management practices.  Second,  the  rules  prohibit  fixed  broadband  providers  from  blocking  lawful content, application, services,  and devices. This means consumers and  innovators will continue to have the  right to send and receive lawful Internet  traffic, with mobile  broadband  service providers subjected to a more  limited set of prohibitions. I will speak  about that in a moment.  Third, the rules aim to ensure that  the Internet remains a level playing  field by prohibiting  fixed broadband  providers from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network  traffic—which they have done.  Finally, the rules are meant to apply  with the complementary principle of  reasonable  network  management,  which provides broadband providers the  flexibility  to  address  congestion  or  traffic that is harmful to the network.  These are principles that I believe everyone  can  support.  I  see  nothing  wrong with them. The word ‘‘reasonable’’  somehow  doesn’t  scare me.  Maybe it should, but it doesn’t.  I ask my colleagues, what is wrong  with transparency? Why would we want  to promote Internet blocking or discrimination? Why would we want to  have some people on the fast lane and  some on the slow lane, depending on  whether you paid your Internet provider enough money? What is unreasonable  about  reasonable  network  management?  I believe that the FCC’s effort, along  with ongoing oversight and enforcement, will protect consumers, and I believe  it will provide companies with  the certainty they need to make investments in our growing digital economy.  While many champions of the open  Internet would have preferred a stricter decision—and I am one of them; I  myself have  real  reservations about  treating wireless broadband differently  from wired  broadband—I  think  the  FCC’s  decision was  nevertheless  a  meaningful step forward. In a moment,  I will talk about other people who feel  the same.  Supporters of the joint resolution fail  to acknowledge that the FCC’s open  Internet  rules  have  received  overwhelming  support  from  broadband  Internet service providers, consumers,  and public groups, labor unions, as well  as high-tech companies.  AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson stated earlier this year that while he wanted  ‘‘no regulation,’’ the FCC’s open  Internet order ‘‘ended at a place where  we have a line of sight and we know  and can commit ourselves to investments.’’  Time-Warner Cable said at the time  of the order’s release that the rules  adopted ‘‘appear to reflect a workable  balance between protecting consumers’  interests and preserving incentives for  investment  and  innovation  by  broadband Internet service providers.’’  Numerous analysts  from major  investment banks have found that the  open Internet order removes what they  call regulatory overhang and allows  telecom and cable companies to focus  on investment.  Google, Facebook, Twitter,  eBay,  Skype, and other leaders in innovation  all urged the FCC to adopt ‘‘commonsense baseline rules . . . critical to ensuring that the Internet remains a key  engine of economic growth, innovation,  and global competitiveness.’’  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:53 Nov 10, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09NO6.014 S09NOPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2011

1974,20,2011-11-09,Mr. FRANKEN.," Madam President, I  rise today to urge my colleagues to  vote against the motion to proceed to  the joint resolution of disapproval of  Senator HUTCHISON, which would repeal  the FCC’s net neutrality rules.  As many of you know, I have repeatedly said net neutrality  is the  free  speech issue of our time. I still believe  that is the case, and I am here to state  why we need to do everything we can  to stop this partisan resolution in its  tracks.  But before I get into the reasons we  should oppose this resolution, I think  it is important to step back and remember what the American people expect of us. I do not need to tell anyone  in this body that the approval rating of  Congress is at an all-time low. Why is  that? I think it has something to do  with the fact that we are using our extremely limited, valuable time to debate partisan proposals like this one  rather than working together to create  jobs, stimulate our economy, and get  Americans back to work.  When this resolution of disapproval  passed the House back in April, I hoped  that would be the end of it. I hoped my  colleagues would recognize we should  let agencies do their jobs and not employ an arcane procedure to erase a  rule the FCC started thinking about in  2004 under Republican chairman Michael Powell, and again in 2005 when a  different Republican  chairman,  this  time Kevin Martin, adopted a unanimous policy  statement on net neutrality.  When the White House issued a statement indicating the President would  veto this resolution of disapproval if it  came to his desk, I thought my colleagues would be sensible and would  recognize that this was not only unnecessary and foolhardy, but it was also a  pointless exercise and would be just a  giant waste of everyone’s time. Alas,  that is not the case and here we are  spending valuable time on two resolutions of disapproval when we should be  turning to legislation that will get our  economy back up and running again.  I hope the votes we take tomorrow  will send a strong message that we  need to stop these political stunts and  work together to create jobs, jobs, and  more jobs.  But let’s get to the substance of why  I am standing here before you today. I  am here today to talk about net neutrality. Net neutrality is a simple concept. It is the idea that all content and  applications on the Internet should be  treated the same, regardless of who  owns the content or the Web site. This  is not a radical idea. It certainly is not  a new one. We may not realize it, but  net neutrality is the foundation and  core of how the Internet operates every  day and how it has always operated.  When scientists and engineers were  creating the basic architecture of the  Internet, they decided they needed to  establish some basic rules of the road  for Internet traffic. One of the fundamental design principles of the Internet was that all data should be treated  equally, regardless of what was being  sent or who was sending it. That is net  neutrality. It is the same principle we  rely on every day when we use the  Internet, and it is the same principle  our phone companies must adhere to  when they connect our phone calls.  They did not discriminate based on  what we say or whom we call, and the  founders of the Internet thought the  same should be true about data traveling across networks. Everything and  everyone should be treated the same.  This principle of nondiscrimination  is baked into the DNA of the Internet.  This  is not radical or new. This  is  about having a platform that is free  and open to all, regardless of whether  one is a big corporation or a single individual and regardless of whether one  pays a lot of money to speed up how  fast their content gets to their customers. Net neutrality is what we all  experience today when we log on to our  computers, and it is what we have always experienced since the very beginning of the Internet.  I think it is important to focus on  that point for a minute because our opponents are telling us something quite  different—and they are wrong. Net neutrality is not about a government takeover of the Internet, and it is not about  changing anything. Net neutrality and  the rules the FCC passed are about  keeping  the  Internet  the way  it  is  today and the way it has always been.

1979,27,2011-11-09,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," I thank the Chair.  Mr. President, I have been looking  for a time when the floor was open to  refute some of the comments and concerns raised earlier on the Senate floor.  I want to start by taking on a comment that was made by the Senator  from Minnesota, Mr. FRANKEN, who  said YouTube started above a pizzeria  in 2005 and sold for $1.6 billion 2 years  later to Google, and that wouldn’t have  been possible without net neutrality.  Well, Mr. President, I must point out  that we didn’t have net neutrality in  2005. We haven’t had Federal regulation  of the Internet in this country such as  we have seen during this last year put  forward by this administration. In fact,  YouTube and Google were both created  in a marketplace without net neutrality regulations. Other online successes—Facebook, Hulu, Twitter, and  new devices such as the Apple iPhone  and  Amazon  Kindle—all  happened  without  net  neutrality  regulations.  These  are  innovations  that  have  changed communication patterns not  only  in our country but around the  world as well. So we have had these innovations without the heavy hand of  government.  It is very interesting to hear the debate on the Senate floor because we  seem to hear that net neutrality  is  something that will keep the Internet  open. The opposite is true. It is beginning to put the clamps on the successes  that we have had by having an open  Internet. All these companies they are  talking about needing net neutrality to  come forward and blossom and grow  are the companies that have done exactly that without net neutrality regulations.  What we should do is assure that we  don’t put a blanket over the Internet  and start saying to everybody who has  a new idea or a new product or a new  service provider: You better go to the  FCC before you go forward with that or  you could be in jeopardy. You could be  penalized. You could be  thought  to  have an ‘‘unreasonable’’ product on the  Internet because we don’t know yet  what is reasonable. We just know you  have to be reasonable because we have  a new regulation now that says you  must be reasonable, without any definition of what this FCC—which had no  authority to go into this area—is going  to determine is a ‘‘reasonable’’ product  that would not interfere with anything  else.  Mr. President, we haven’t had net  neutrality before. All the successes I  hear talked about in this debate have  happened without  the heavy or  the  light hand of government stopping the  originality and  innovation  that has  marked the success of our country.  Earlier, Mr. KERRY, the Senator from  Massachusetts, said the Internet made  the 1996 Telecommunications Act obsolete 6 months after it was enacted. But  if the 1996 act did not sufficiently address the Internet, thus making it obsolete, how can that same law be the  genesis and basis of the FCC’s assertion  it has the power to regulate the Internet? We have to have one or the other,  and it is our assertion the FCC did not  get specific authority to regulate the  Internet that is required for Congress  to give it in order to make rules in this  area. So Senator KERRYcan’t have it  both ways. He can’t  say  the Telecommunications Act was obsolete but  it is also the basis of these new restrictive regulations.  Senator KERRY sent a  ‘‘Dear Colleague’’ letter to everyone in the Senate asking them to vote against this  resolution. What  I  think  Senator  KERRYwas saying in that letter is that  net neutrality is not a regulation of  the Internet because it is just a regulation of the onramp. In other words, we  are not trying to support the FCC regulating the whole Internet; they are just  doing the gateway, they are just doing  the onramp.  Well, that was the position the FCC  took when they made this regulation.  But we can’t argue that net neutrality  is not regulation of the Internet because the Internet service providers are  the only onramps to the Internet. It is  a misleading statement to say that  just regulating the onramp isn’t regulating the Internet. The Internet is the  entire global network of millions of  computer networks. It uses the Internet protocol standard to interconnect  with  each other.  Internet backbone  providers and last-mile Internet service providers serve as the foundation of  the Internet. So they are the foundation.  Web sites and services such as e-mail  and voice-over IP, or VOIP, allow users  to communicate on top of the foundation. The Internet is the whole online  ecosystem put together. We can’t have  the edge without the core and vice  versa. The onramp is as much a part of  the information superhighway as are  the cars traveling on it.  FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell  put it well in his dissent from the open  Internet order that we are discussing  today. He said:  To say that today’s rules don’t regulate  the Internet is like saying regulating highway on  ramps, off  ramps, and pavement  don’t equate  to  regulating  the highways  themselves.  Mr. President, if we are going to say  the FCC can regulate the onramp—and  that is the first heavy hand of government that is going to start controlling  and making decisions about what  is  reasonable  and  what  is  not—that  means businesses are going to have to  go to the FCC and say: Mother may I.  If they have an  innovative product,  that  is going to cost the consumer  more because they will have had to go  and hire lawyers to go to the FCC to  get prior approval or it will delay the  product getting out to consumers, possibly letting a European service provider that doesn’t have these kinds of  barriers get ahead of us.  Internet technology is the basis of  hundreds of thousands of jobs and products in our country. We are in a crisis  right now. We all know we have 9 percent unemployment and that our economy is even dead in the water. So we  have to do something to jump-start the  economy. The last thing we want to do  is put a blanket on it to make it harder  for it to come back. I don’t think anybody in this country with any common  sense is going to say we have a thriving  economy right now. So  it does defy  common sense to say we are going to  allow regulations Congress has not approved and that Congress has not authorized the regulator to make, knowing it will have the effect of either  freezing or delaying  the  innovation  that has been the hallmark of the success of the Internet and technology in  our country.  There are several organizations that  have banded together to ask that people vote for the resolution today. I ask  unanimous consent to have printed in  the RECORDa letter from, among others, Americans for Tax Reform, Taxpayers Protection Alliance, Hispanic  Leadership Fund, and Americans  for  Prosperity.

1984,34,2011-11-09,Ms. CANTWELL.," I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee for  his leadership on this important issue.  I am glad to be on the Senate floor to  set the record straight because we are  here to talk about Internet  freedom  and about making sure the Internet  does not have undue costs and expenses  for consumers.  If you liked TARP and you liked the  bailout of the big banks, well, guess  what. Then you should vote for this  resolution because this resolution  is  about whether you are going to let the  communications companies that want  to make the Internet more expensive  by  various  technologies  have  their  way.  If you believe the FCC should establish some rules to protect the freedom  of the Internet, then you should oppose  the Hutchison resolution. I prefer legislation that I have introduced, and some  of my colleagues support, called the  Freedom of the Internet Act, that goes  further than what the Federal Communications Commission has done to implement true net neutrality. I would  prefer that, and maybe in the future  my colleagues will be working on such  legislation.  But as it is today, the Federal Communications Commission has taken a  half step,  if you will, by proposing  some rules that will set in place some  protections  for  consumers  to make  sure they are protected on important  aspects of keeping Internet costs down.  The problem with the FCC rules is they  only apply  in  some  cases  to  fixed  broadband  and  not  to  mobile  broadband.  So if you think about it this way, the  Internet  is moving  to  a mobile  broadband platform; that is, our hand-  held devices, whether they are a BlackBerry or phone or what have you. So  many more Americans are accessing  the Internet that way. So the FCC has  come up with rules on transparency  and no blocking; that is, to make sure  no content is blocked or slowed down  for any undue cost or reason, and a  nondiscrimination rule.  Unfortunately, those two last points,  no blocking and unreasonable discrimination, do not apply to the mobile side.  So we have work to do to make sure  the youth of America who are consuming  so  much  content  online  through their mobile devices are not  going to be artificially charged more or  slowed down in their access all because  the  telecommunications  industry  wants to have its way with the Internet.  My colleagues have been out here  talking about  innovation. I can tell  you, the Internet has had a ton of innovation and a ton of content creation,  all because there has been an even  playing field and net neutrality. The  fact now  is  that  the  telecommunications companies are debating an important issue, and the lines get blurred  between telecommunications and the  Internet, and it is clear we do not have  all of the rules in place to make sure  consumer interests are protected.  But today we have one thing: the  FCC rules that are trying to slow down  telecommunication companies from artificially either blocking or making  content on the Internet more expensive. Again, when we go to the mobile  phone model and we are being charged  for time and data transfer, the  fact  that the data transfer and time take  longer means we are going to have  more expensive phone bills. That  is  why I said it was TARP-like, because  the ‘‘cha-ching’’ we are going to hear  from  the  phone  companies  on  the  money they are going to make from  this is unbelievable.  So thank God the FCC took a half  step and said: Whoa. Slow down. We are  not going to let you do that. That is  why people  like Vint Cerf and Tim  Berners-Lee, the architects and inventors pushing the Internet, have said  what a bad idea it is to not make sure  that net neutrality is the law of the  land.  I notice my colleague who just spoke  said, well, there have not been any  problems. There have not been any  issues. I read the online publications.  Larry Lessig, someone I trust, was recounting in one of his interviews exactly what happened. Comcast went in  and basically blocked large data files  of peer-to-peer transfer, what is called  bit torrent traffic.  First, Comcast said: No, no. We do  not do that. We did not block that. We  do not do it. But when it was basically  found out that they did, they said: Oh,  no, we did not block it. We just slowed  it down. They sent little messages, as  Mr. Lessig says in his article, to the  Internet traffic to confuse the recipient  and basically disrupt their traffic. OK?  So that is what is happening.  These providers think  if they can  control the pipe, now they can also  control the  flow.  It  is also, as Mr.  Lessig said later in this article, as if  the entire electricity grid, our refrigerators and our toasters and our dryers, all of a sudden would start charging different rates on different things  because the electricity company would  decide it had the ability to charge different rates. Would we put up with  that? No, we would not put up with  that.  So why would we put up with allowing telcos to run at will on the Internet  charging  consumers  anything  they  want based on the fact that they think  they have the control of the switch?  I am so proud the chairman, Senator  ROCKEFELLER, has led this fight for the  freedom of the Internet to drive down  costs, to keep innovation, and to protect net neutrality. The FCC rules do  not go far enough. We cannot continue  to have this half step and not clearly,  on the mobile side, give consumers the  protection they need.  But for today, if you want to vote  with Internet consumers and Internet  users on driving down the costs of the  Internet, then vote against this resolution and keep the minimal FCC rules in  place until we can get stronger legislation passed. Make no mistake about it,  the other side is talking about, well,  they do not want to regulate the Internet. That is true. They do not want to  regulate telcos that want to take advantage of the fact that they own the  pipe and can charge a lot more.  I am glad the FCC at least took this  measure. We  should make  sure  it  stands until we can even get stronger  Internet freedom protection.  I yield the floor.  ",2011

1997,41,2011-11-09,Mr. CORKER.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak about a bill we introduced called  the Residential Mortgage Market Privatization and Standardization Act. I  wish to speak briefly on this bill that  deals with the pressing  issue that I  know the Senator from Arizona probably as much as anybody in the Senate  has spoken about and has championed  for many years.  The  current dynamic permit  conservatorship  is not sustainable with  Fannie and Freddie and the GSEs as  they are today. There has been discussion about various things happening  with these organizations. The FHFA,  which actually regulates Freddie Mac  and Fannie Mae, is begging Congress  for direction but,  in their words,  is  only getting mixed signals. Today, we  introduced a bill to give a very clear  direction as to what ought to happen  to these major GSEs.  Together, they sit atop $5 trillion in  obligations, plus hundreds of thousands  of our REO properties—in other words,  properties they have taken back and  are now overseeing throughout America. With a $5 trillion book, any mistake they make is very expensive, and  obviously the taxpayers of this country  know full well that billions of dollars  continue to flow in these organizations  to keep them afloat. Yet these organizations today are lameduck organizations with no clear guidance on their  future. They really have no idea what  the  future holds. The organizations  themselves  basically  are  treading  water.  Over the most recent decade, Fannie  and Freddie became corporate welfare  schemes for mortgage banks. There is  no question that what was happening  was the governance balance sheet was  helping  fund  corporate welfare programs or basically mortgage brokers  could sell off to Fannie and Freddie  mortgages they had put in place and  have them guaranteed.  As they raced to the bottom to lower  guarantee fees so they could take a  bigger market share  for the biggest  mortgage  originators,  they  actually  helped fuel the housing bubble that has  led us to where we are today. There is  no question about it.  So many people talk about Fannie  and Freddie  and  say  that without  them, we would not have affordability  in housing. Well, at the end of the day,  Fannie and Freddie don’t make housing more affordable. What they do is  simply make  interest rates too  low.  What that actually does  is push up  home prices. That is the exact equation  that occurs in this process. Housing affordability  is  determined  by  your  monthly mortgage payment. Fannie  and Freddie make interest rates cheap,  but the price of housing ends up being  more expensive as a result of that. So,  in effect, the taxpayer is suddenly on  the hook for losses when these housing  prices are pushed up, and the fact is we  end up having a bubble like we have  had.  The market can and will take over  the functions of mortgage credit risk if  we make the transition in an intelligent way, and that is what this bill  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:13 Nov 10, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G09NO6.065 S09NOPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2011

2022,5,2011-11-15,Mr. TERRY.," ‘‘It is the debtor that is  ruined by hard times.’’ That was said  by our 19th President, Rutherford B.  Hayes. It  is a timely and  insightful  comment.  The United States now is the debtor.  We are $15 trillion in debt, rising at a  yearly clip of $1.5 trillion with really  no institutional control to stop that.  Yes, we’re in hard times—9 percent-  plus  unemployment  for  3  years  straight. A report the other day said  the real unemployment rate from those  that have  just given up  is probably  closer to 15 percent—16 million to 20  million Americans. Our  savings, decreasing, mostly because of the dollars  that are going towards buying bonds or  selling bonds to China.  Now, before us this week, though, is  probably one of the most  important  votes that this Congress will take this  year, and that is to pass an amendment  to our Constitution forcing this body  to balance its budget. Now I know it’s  stunning to many people that our Constitution didn’t have that. There were  lots of fail-safes built into our Constitution, and I think that our Founding Fathers never thought that deficit  spending other than at a time of war  would ever occur in our country, but it  has, and it’s become the norm.  Why has it become the norm in Congress? Simply answered, because you  can. There’s nothing to stop it. The  easiest way, the most political way so  you never have to say ‘‘no’’ is to deficit  spend. My friends, that has to end. It  has to end this congressional session.  Now,  the balanced budget amendment is a simple one. It says, basically,  we cannot spend more than our revenues. That’s what most State constitutions have, that’s what the Nebraska  constitution has, and that’s what the  city charter for Omaha has. I spent 8  years on the Omaha city council. We  had to have a balanced budget. You  have  to make  tough decisions.  I’ve  been there when people have come and  said, we need new water parks or we  need something else. We on the city  council, because we had to live by a  balanced budget, had to make a decision of raising taxes, cutting somewhere else, or saying ‘‘no.’’ Those are  your only three options.  Well the time has come that Congress needs the institutional barriers  to spending, and it’s the balanced budget amendment. It will be the institutionalized  discipline  that  has  been  lacking here for decades. The time has  come to pass it.  I want  to  leave  this one general  point, both disappointing and hopeful.  There was an article in USA Today,  November 4 or so, 11, 12 days ago,  where it quoted the Democratic leadership saying to their own people, kill  the balanced budget amendment. They  want to preserve the right to deficit  spend our future away at $1.5 trillion  per year. Fortunately,  as we have  heard  from one Democratic Member,  he’s not following the Democratic leadership’s orders here. I hope that we will  get enough of our Democratic friends  who believe in fiscal discipline to join  us.  It takes two-thirds of both the  House and the Senate to do that. It  will be a close vote. So on something as  simple as saying that our expenditures  can’t exceed our revenues, I ask for all  of my colleagues’ support.  f  TRUTH-TELLING ABOUT THE WAR  IN AFGHANISTAN: A FIREABLE  OFFENSE  ",2011
2023,5,2011-11-15,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from  California  (Ms. WOOLSEY)  for 5 minutes.  ,2011
2024,5,2011-11-15,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, sometimes it seems like the surest way to  get in the most trouble is to tell the  truth about the war in Afghanistan.  Witness  the  case of Major General  Peter Fuller, whom Congressman WALjust talked about. General  Fuller was  one  of  our  troop  commanders in Afghanistan until he decided to speak his mind. After President Karzai made the outrageous statement that he would back Pakistan in a  war against the United States, Major  General Fuller delivered a colorful and  candid on-the-record  reply. He  said,  ‘‘Why don’t you just poke me in the  eye with a needle?’’ He said this of  President Karzai, whom he also described as erratic and ‘‘isolated from  reality.’’  TERJONES He added that the Afghan Government doesn’t properly appreciate the  enormous  sacrifices  Americans  are  making on Afghanistan’s behalf, especially at a time when we have major  economic  challenges  right  here  at  home.  And what was Major General Fuller’s  reward for telling it like it is? What did  he get for expressing the frustration so  many Americans feel? He was thrown  immediately under the bus. He was  fired, relieved of his command by General John Allen, who admonished General Fuller  for  ‘‘inappropriate public  comments.’’ An interesting choice of  words:  ‘‘inappropriate  public  comments.’’  As Time magazine pointed out, the  implication there seems pretty clear:  What Major General Fuller had the audacity to say out loud—that the Karzai  regime is feckless and corrupt—is what  most people secretly believe. Time correspondent Mark Thompson put it this  way: ‘‘It is not a good sign when what  everyone is saying privately cannot be  stated publicly. In that case, only the  troops—the ones dying—and the taxpayers—the  people  employing  both  Allen and Fuller—are kept willfully in  the  dark.’’ The writer  Christopher  Hitchens put it even more bluntly, saying that to silence Fuller ‘‘is to establish a stupid culture of denial in the  ranks.’’  Throughout this decade, Mr. Speaker, this decade that we’ve been at war,  the failure of our government to level  with us has been a persistent problem.  b1040  Whether it’s the phony weapons of  mass destruction in Iraq or prisoner  abuse and torture or just the refusal to  let soldiers’ coffins be photographed—  that was during the Bush administration—over and over again the American people have been fed a steady diet  of misleading spin and outright lies.  But the people who are paying for this  war in blood and treasure deserve much  better. They are tired of propaganda.  They are owed an honest accounting of  what’s going on, what obstacles we  face, and what kind of progress we’re  making—or not making.  Major General Fuller had enough respect for the American people to tell  them the truth. By refusing to dish out  the same phony platitudes, he may  have lost his job, but he maintained his  integrity. If the continued rationale for  this war is built on a lie that no one  must expose, then surely that’s a sign  that this mission is beyond repair.  The real solution is not to cover up  everything that’s going horribly wrong  in Afghanistan. The solution is to recapture our integrity as a nation and  end this war once and for all, not in  2014, not at some uncertain date in the  future—now. It’s time now to bring our  troops home.

2025,12,2011-11-15,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Madam Speaker,  last night I held a telephone town hall  meeting, and I spoke with hundreds of  my  constituents about  the pressing  issues facing America today.  Many people on the call spoke about  the need for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and an overwhelming majority replied in a survey  that there should be a balanced budget  amendment. I was pleased to report to  them that the House will be voting this  week on a balanced budget amendment  that will help Washington get its fiscal  house in order. And it will reverse the  dangerous practices of saddling our future generations with insurmountable  debt.  A  balanced  budget  amendment,  Madam Speaker, is not a radical idea.  It is a normal expectation for hardworking taxpayers, families, and businesses, as well as State governments.  Why  not  the Federal Government,  Madam Speaker?  f  THE GOP’S JOB PROPOSALS  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2011
2026,12,2011-11-15,Mr. YARMUTH.," Madam Speaker, the  average American household has lost  $8,000 of income over the last few years.  If we want to put a number on the economic crisis facing our country right  now, that should be it.  If you ask the average person how to  get $8,000 back  into the pockets of  American  families, you’d  get  some  pretty good answers. But if you ask the  average  congressional  Republican,  you’d get an answer that’s so out of  touch with reality you’d think they  were creating policy by playing Mad  Libs. Mad Libs, the children’s game  where you provide random words to  complete a  story you haven’t  seen.  That seems like the only conceivable  explanation  for the Republicans’ so-  called jobs proposals.  Think about how they  fill  in this  blank: The best way to get Americans  back to work is—poison our air and  water, get rid of consumer protections,  end Medicare. It’s  like they haven’t  read  the  question.  It’s no  surprise  Americans find the GOP’s Mad Libs economics maddening. It’s time to stop  playing games and  start getting  to  work on building an economy  that  works for all Americans.  f  KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE  (Mr. YODER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2011
2027,12,2011-11-15,Mr. YODER.," Madam Speaker, both  parties in this Congress have espoused  support for job creation. In fact in this  House  daily,  both Republicans  and  Democrats have said the economy and  jobs should be our top priority. The  President has stated in recent months  that he would pivot his time and energy to a focus on jobs.  Yet,  last week this administration  pivoted away from jobs again when it  effectively delayed until 2013 the construction of the Canadian Keystone XL  pipeline, and along with this delay,  killing the potential to create 20,000  jobs. This  $7 billion pipeline would  bring oil from Canada to refineries in  the United States, and it is expected to  add billions of dollars of investment in  the American economy.  With  the  economy  continuing  to  struggle, we can’t wait to create these  new jobs.  The American people are tired of seeing their government say one thing and  do another. It’s time for the rhetoric to  meet the road, and I urge this administration to reconsider its decision, to reconsider this delay, and to unify this  country back to a focus on jobs.  f  JOBS AND FINANCE REFORM  (Ms. LEE of California asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2011
2028,12,2011-11-15,Ms. LEE of California.," I rise to call  on Republicans to wake up to the needs  of Americans, millions of Americans,  mind you, and to create jobs.  The Republican-led Congress has led  almost an entire year without enacting  a  single  piece  of  jobs  legislation.  Madam Speaker, America cannot wait.  Republicans continue to ignore the  crisis of unemployment and poverty in  America  and  instead keep  bringing  more bills to bail out the wealthy.  Let’s stop bailing out Wall Street and  bring some real relief to Main Street.  Let’s  stop wasting  time  pretending  that markets can regulate themselves.  We need strong oversight so that we  have no more Bernie Madoffs and bank  bailouts. Let’s stop wasting time pretending that tax cuts for the wealthy  pay for themselves. We need corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair  share.  Last week, Madam Speaker, I held a  jobs fair. Thousands showed up. People  want to work. This is a national emergency. Let’s  reignite  the American  dream by passing the American Jobs  Act now.  IRAQ MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO  SOUTHERN BORDER  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2011
2029,12,2011-11-15,Mr. POE of Texas.," Madam Speaker,  the troops  in Iraq will be home by  Christmas. Also coming back to America is a large amount of military equipment. Why not send some of that taxpayer-funded equipment to secure our  southern border? Our border sheriffs  say they are outmanned, outgunned,  and out-financed by the drug cartels.  Today,  I’ve  introduced  legislation  which mandates that 10 percent of certain military equipment coming back  from Iraq will go to our southern border.  If  there’s an urgent need,  the  equipment could be kept by the Department of Defense. This equipment  includes Humvees, night-vision equipment, and surveillance UAVs.  This is not a new idea. The Department of Defense already has a program  for distribution of surplus equipment.  My legislation will simply utilize this  already-existing program, expand  it,  and allocate resources to our southern  border.  Americans have paid for this equipment to bring safety and security to  the people of Iraq. It’s time we use this  equipment to protect our own citizens  from the invasion of the drug cartels.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION  (Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)  ",2011
2030,12,2011-11-15,Mr. CONNOLLY of Virginia.," Madam  Speaker, failure is not an option. Let  none of us forget that we work for the  American people, and they expect us to  do our job. World markets are watching, balance is demanded; $1.2 trillion  in deficit reduction is the minimal target we must meet.  Current Federal spending is 25 percent of the GDP. It’s too high. But revenue is only 14 to 15 percent of the  GDP. It’s too low. It is the height of irresponsibility to ignore either one of  those two data points.  It might be easy, but it’s not rocket  science. It requires both parties to do  what a clear majority of Americans  want us to do: break out of our respective straitjacket orthodoxies.  I was proud to join a hundred bipartisan Members of this body urging the  supercommittee to go big—find $4 trillion in deficit reduction. Such efforts  would reduce the debt to a more manageable percentage of GDP, reassure  markets, preserve our Nation’s triple A  bond rating and provide the stability  to  get America’s  economy  growing  again.  I urge my colleagues on the supercommittee to join us and go big for  America.

2031,19,2011-11-15,Mr. NUGENT.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  In 2007 a Colorado man named Matthew Murray allegedly wrote online,  ‘‘All I want to do is kill and injure as  many Christians as  I can.’’ Murray  then went on to a shooting rampage,  first killing two young students at a  missionary training center outside of  Denver. And then at a gathering of  7,000 people in and around the New Life  Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado,  with a rifle and a backpack full of ammunition, Murray entered the church  and opened  fire, killing two sisters.  Murray was ultimately  stopped and  killed by a church member and a volunteer security guard, Jeanne Assam,  who has a concealed-carry permit and  once  worked  in  law  enforcement.  Assam shot Murray several times, leading him to kill himself.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011
2032,19,2011-11-15,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Madam Speaker, I  would like to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado, a member of  the Rules Committee, ",2011
2033,19,2011-11-15,Mr. POLIS.,  ,2011
2034,19,2011-11-15,Mr. POLIS.," I thank the gentleman  from Massachusetts.  In hearing the story of my  friend  from Florida and my colleague on the  Rules Committee, again I think it just  emphasizes that my State, Colorado,  also has a concealed-carry process. We  have a must-issue provision. Some of  our county sheriffs were not issuing  and were denying issuance unreasonably. Again, it highlights that this entire bill  is a dangerous solution  in  search of a problem.  Colorado has  reciprocal concealed-  carry  arrangements  with  over  30  States, including all of our neighboring  States. So you can drive from Colorado  to Wyoming in the north, to the south  to New Mexico, and east or west, and  you’re in no danger about your concealed weapon permit not being recognized.  And, yes, there are some States that  we don’t have a reciprocal agreement  from. For instance, the State of Nevada. I fail to be convinced that the  proper venue for that is not for the  people of the sovereign State of Nevada  and the sovereign State of Colorado to  elect leadership that will work on a reciprocal carry arrangement  if that’s  what they want to do. If there is a real  issue there, and my constituents are  hampered by their ability not to have  their Colorado concealed weapons permit recognized let’s say in the State of  California, that’s a matter between the  States.  Opening the door for Federal intervention  in  this very  sensitive area  opens the door to a Federal gun owner  registry, which a number of gun rights  advocates  in my  district  have  expressed a great deal of worry over, as  well as opening the door for a whole  host of other problems that can come  from Washington, D.C., bureaucrats deciding where you can and can’t take  your guns rather than protecting our  Second Amendment in the States.  Some other concerns have been articulated to me from some of the gun  owner rights groups  in the State of  Colorado. They’re worried about more  onerous standards to acquire a permit.  They’re worried about a national database of permit holders. They’re also  worried about this particular provision  nullifying the constitutional carry provisions that are on the books in Arizona, Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming.  And that States that have a popular  election method of amending the Constitution are able to do so.  So again, what’s the problem? I have  not had any constituents contact me  worried that they can’t use their concealed weapons permit in a particular  State. I think they are generally, and I  have many  concealed-carry  license  holders in my district. I don’t happen  to be one myself, but they are able to,  again, in all the bordering States drive  across State borders and not have to  worry about relicensing or notifying  authorities in those States. I think the  gentleman from Florida articulated an  example  in Colorado where our concealed-carry permit holder helped save  some lives, and I think that is a fine  and good thing. Again, it is an area of  State sovereignty.  I asked the chair of the Judiciary  Committee yesterday in Rules whether  he thought this provision was constitutionally required to protect the Second  Amendment. He responded that no, the  State does not have to have a concealed weapons system, a concealed-  carry system under the Second Amendment. It is a matter of discretion or  policy in that State.  I think this bill runs contrary to  State sovereignty and to the privacy of  individuals. That’s why I encourage my  colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill.  ",2011
2035,19,2011-11-15,Mr. NUGENT.," The gentleman talks  about States’ rights. We agree, there  are States that do not have concealed-  carry permits. So  it  is within  the  States’ rights to decide how they are  going to regulate that particular issue  in regards to weapons in their State.  Madam Speaker, I would like to yield  3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from  North Carolina, Dr. FOXX.  ",2011
2036,19,2011-11-15,Ms. FOXX.,"  I  thank my colleague  from Florida for handling the rule.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying  bill. As a life member of the National  Rifle Association and strong supporter  of  the Second Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  I  am  pleased to speak in support of H.R. 822,  the  National  Right-to-Carry  Reciprocity Act, which will help protect  law-abiding American citizens’ right to  bear arms.  The Supreme Court ruled in District  of Columbia v. Heller that ‘‘the inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right,’’  and in McDonald v. City of Chicago  that the Federal Government can intervene to ensure that State and local  governments are not restricting Second Amendment rights. Statistics show  correlation between right-to-carry laws  and a decrease in violent crime rates.  According to NRA estimates based on  the FBI’s Annual Uniform Crime Report, States that have right-to-carry  laws have 22 percent lower total violent crime rates, 30 percent lower murder  rates,  46 percent  lower  robbery  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:46 Nov 16, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A15NO7.016 H15NOPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

2039,26,2011-11-15,Mr. LARSEN of Washington.," I reluctantly rise to object to the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Puerto  Rico, which would  undermine  the  Jones Act.  The amendment would allow foreign-  flagged,  foreign-built,  foreign-owned,  and  foreign-manned vessels over  100  gross tons to carry passengers within  Puerto Rico. As  such,  this waiver  would disadvantage U.S. maritime operators and U.S. seafarers who might  otherwise provide such services. In its  present form, we cannot support the  amendment.  I commend the gentleman from Puerto Rico for his sincere efforts to expand  maritime commerce  in Puerto Rico,  but I cannot support the amendment  he has offered today.  With that, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2011

2041,26,2011-11-15,Mr. PIERLUISI.," In closing, Madam  Chair, I hear that there is some opposition, but what frustrates me is that  there are no specifics. I haven’t yet  heard a specific way in which my proposed  amendment would  harm  any  U.S.-flagged vessel or industry.  Indeed,  the  groups  that  are  supposedly opposing have not been able to  articulate  any  specific  amendment  that I could make to my bill to take  care of their concerns. Rather, their  concerns appear to be more of a generalized and of a vague quality, namely  that they are concerned that allowing  any modification or revision to the  Passenger Vessel Services Act will  eventually lead to other requests for  modifications down the line.  I believe we have to be balanced.  Puerto Rico has been  economically  going through a recession now for 5  years in a row, and this could make a  difference. Helping Puerto Rico helps  the U.S. We are  talking, after all,  about an American  territory, about  American jobs, and about the nautical  tourism industry in Puerto Rico and  the U.S.  I urge my colleagues to support my  amendment.

2058,33,2011-11-15,Mr.  BECERRA.," All of these folks, if I have  not left out anyone, have been talking  time after time of Make It In America.  But more  importantly, we are not  broke. If we can insist on letting our  small businesses and our manufacturers get a leg up and we stop giving  giveaways to those who are the beneficiaries of the Bush tax cuts and begin  CLYBURN,  some new concepts in funding, I think  we can make it.  I want to close by simply saying to  my friends in the private sector, you  complain when we talk about pass the  jobs bill. Frankly, I think it’s a commonsense approach—payroll tax relief,  hiring  the  chronically  unemployed,  putting to work teachers so that class  sizes can go down, educating your next  workforce,  firefighters,  police,  et  cetera. It is well documented that our  large companies have a very flush cash  flow. It is well documented that our  major banks, our multinational banks,  are well endowed with resources. My  plea is that all of us become patriots,  not party belongers, not card-carrying  sign wavers as it relates to what party  you’re in, and begin to invest in America.  Frankly,  our  President  has  stabilized—stabilized—the  economy.  It’s  not where we want it to be. It’s not  bleeding. It’s not where we want to go,  but it’s on the surge up. The numbers  will show that it can do that.  We need the kind of partnership with  the private sector that is long overdue,  and we need the support by our government of supporting our manufacturing.  We can come back. Before you know it,  we will be percolating along and being  the  leader,  if you will, of manufacturing, businesses, job creation, and investment as not arrogantly so but the  model for the world in how do you invest in your people. And I’m looking  forward  to  that  starting with  supporting a number of initiatives that  are already  suggested and certainly  some that I’m introducing.  But I am just delighted that we have  the thinkers that realize that investing  in America is not the end but the beginning of a greater and greater America.  ",2011
2059,33,2011-11-15,Mr. TONKO.," Thank you, Representative JACKSONLEE, for your outstanding  leadership on behalf of the Texas district that you represent with your outstanding  leadership  on  this  floor.  You’re so right. Everywhere we turn,  you can see job creation and what it  means to the local regional economy.  I have a touring concept that we do  in our district, and we have a roundtable discussion routinely held with  the small business community. And it  is just profound to go around and see  how many people are investing in manufacturing out there; and their product  delivery is powerful, and the fact that  they’re exporting  is an encouraging  and enthusiastic thought. So it’s all  about showcasing what can happen.  And just think of it on a grander  scale  when  we  provide  the  underpinnings of support, when we invest in that concept of manufacturing  and move forward with the incubator  networks and all of the activities that  nourish this sort of comeback story  that is so essential right now after this  economy was brought to its knees by  an approach that was hard-hearted to  manufacturing.  It  ignored what was  happening. The same is true in agriculture, and we will maybe talk about  that in a few minutes.  ",2011
2060,33,2011-11-15,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," You’re  absolutely right.  Just one point about Make  It  In  America and the  idea of companies  such as Siemens, our colleague from  California, indicated, that they are in  California, rightly so. And we should be  very, very strong in making sure that  our Federal dollars—this is not selfish.  We are probably more expansive and  liberal  than many  other  countries  around the world to ensure that  if  you’re using our Federal tax dollars,  you build it and make it in America,  and you spread it.  There’s a company called Caf, and I  know  that  they’re  located  in New  York. We want them to spread some of  that construction and building work  down  in  Houston,  Texas,  because  they’re building a light rail with $900  million, potentially, of Federal dollars.  So we can do this together, make everybody happy, create jobs, and insist  upon putting our families, our young  people, and America first in job creation, building buildup and making it  in America.  I thank the gentleman.  b1530  ",2011
2061,33,2011-11-15,Mr. TONKO.," Absolutely. And I think  it is about investing, the key word; investing our way to a stronger tomorrow, investing our way to opportunity,  investing our way to prosperity. I see  it all the time. The dollars that were  invested  from State  sources, public  sources, and some Federal dollars into  the capital region of New York that I  represent  leveraged  tremendous  private sector dollars with an investment  in the bottom-line calculation in nanotechnology, in semiconductor science,  in chip manufacturing, and in green  collar workforce development. These  dynamics are so powerful that they  have lifted that region to the first of  all hubs in America for job growth of  the green collar variety, and in the top  five as a hub for high-tech growth. So  it happens. When you invest, it happens.  Now, speaking about sound voices for  a resurgence in our private sector job  growth, in our public sector support  networks, for those employees, a tremendously dynamic voice from our new  freshman class, Representative TERRI  from the great State of AlaSEWELL bama.  Representative, thank you for joining us this afternoon. And I know that  you’ve been a very powerful voice for  job creation, job retention in our economy.  ",2011

We are working so hard here in  the House on coming up with those solutions. We will be voting on a balanced  budget  amendment—and  I’m  very excited about that—as has been  required by the Budget Control Act  that we passed in August.  I’m here now as one of those new  freshmen. And it is amazing to me and,  of course, we all know that for over 200  years we’ve  functioned without  the  Federal Government having to be held  to—  ",2011
2064,40,2011-11-15,Mrs. SCHMIDT.," May I ask a question? When you do your bills, do you do  what this lady is doing and balance  your checkbook first? What would happen if you didn’t do that?  ",2011
2065,40,2011-11-15,Mrs. ELLMERS.," Absolutely. All of  our homes, we all live by budgets. The  American people have had to redo their  budgets over and over and over again.  Why? Because of  the economy  that  we’re in today, because of the cost. And  yet the Federal Government does not  do this. Now we are up to what, 930  days that the Senate has not passed a  budget? We passed our budget. We  passed a budget  in  the House. The  President had a budget. But his budget  called  for over  $1  trillion more of  spending that we were not taking in.  ",2011
2066,40,2011-11-15,Mrs. SCHMIDT.," So it didn’t balance,  did it?  ",2011
2067,40,2011-11-15,Mrs. ELLMERS.,"  It didn’t balance,  and it didn’t pass in the Senate. Ours  did not come up for a vote. So Washington continues to function without a  budget. And yet, again, our households  function with a budget. Mothers and  fathers are up at 3 o’clock in the morning worrying about how they’re going  to pay the bills this month, and yet the  Federal  Government  just  says,  it  doesn’t matter. We can just continue  to spend money. As long as we don’t  have a budget, we can spend as much  we want.  That is the problem. And the American people are tired of this. They are  tired of us just with our open checkbook writing, having to raise the debt  ceiling to take care of the bills that  have already been submitted and the  interest that we have to pay.  The  balanced  budget  amendment  that we’re talking about passing passed  the House in 1995, went on to the Senate, missed passing by one vote. Where  would we be today in our economy if  that had passed back then? The Federal Government would have been held  to a vote, they would have been held to  a budget, and we wouldn’t be deciding  these things. We wouldn’t be having to  pass continuing resolutions that the  American people look to us in Washington and say, where is the leadership? How can it possibly be that that’s  the way they’re functioning? And yet  this is what we have to do to keep  Washington  running  because Washington does have a purpose. We have to  provide  for the national defense, we  have to take care of our seniors, and  we have to take care of those individuals who cannot take care of themselves. And yet, without a budget, we  have no way of deciding how much that  will be. And so we continue on.  This version makes it harder to raise  taxes. This version is substantial. The  balanced budget amendment says that  in order to raise the debt ceiling, the  future Congress will have to have a  three-fifths majority to vote in each  Chamber in order to raise the debt ceiling. That will become even more difficult.  This is what the American people are  calling for us to do. They’re crying out  for leadership. If we pass this balanced  budget amendment in the House and it  goes on to the Senate and passes there  as well, then it will move on to the  States for ratification. This will be historic. We will now be saying to the  Federal Government, you must adhere  to a budget. It’s as simple as that. The  most basic function of any household  and of any business is to have a working budget in place, and yet the Federal Government,  in  its  arrogance,  says, no, we do not. Therefore, we are  stuck in this situation that we, as you  know, are dealing with every day, trying to figure out how we’re going to  pay for the things that we have that  the American people need.  Under President Obama, the national  debt has increased 34 percent. Clearly,  it is time to stop. Clearly, the American people are saying to us, come up  with a solution. We’re dealing every  day here in Washington with trying to  make  it through, trying to build a  foundation  for the  future. This balanced budget amendment will be a tool  that we can use so that our children  and our grandchildren will know prosperity, and we will ensure it. It’s time  to get it done.  Thank you so much for letting me  speak on this issue.  ",2011
2068,40,2011-11-15,Mrs. SCHMIDT.," I thank you for your  attention in this matter, and you’re  absolutely right. We’ve got to get control of the spending and get control of  it now.  It reminds me of when you’re trying  to go on a diet. And so if I’m trying to  go on a diet back home—believe it or  not, every once in a while I have to  watch what I eat—I don’t sit there and  have every candy bar in the world out  in front of me and open them up. That  only entices me to want to eat it. So if  I’m going to go on a diet, I don’t buy  the candy. I buy an apple, I buy bananas, I buy something that is filling  and good for me. But I certainly don’t  tempt myself with something that I  know is only going to be wasted calories and put on weight. And yet, we  don’t do that here at the Federal level.  We say, well, it’s okay, we’ll cut spending tomorrow, but we’ll spend today. If  we had a balanced budget amendment,  we couldn’t have that attitude. We’d  have to look at every single dime that  is in our checking account and account  for it before we built a new program.  Look at how many attempts there  are for new programs, small and large,  right here in this body. You’ve been  here 11 months. How many programs  and ideas have come before you and  you’ve had to say, can we afford it? But  here we don’t have to answer that question. We have the freedom to do it. We  may not be able to afford it, but I’m  not balancing the checkbook, so we  don’t know.  It doesn’t matter.  It’s  okay.  No, it’s not. We have to force ourselves to do what’s right for America,  and not just here in 2011, but in 2111  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:46 Nov 16, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K15NO7.080 H15NOPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

2182,54,2011-11-15,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  am very pleased that we are considering the historic nomination of Judge  Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to the United  States District Court for the Northern  District of California.  When she is confirmed, she will be  the first Latina district judge in the  Northern District of California.  Judge Gonzalez Rogers first came to  my attention through a bipartisan Judicial Advisory Committee that I have  set up in California. This committee  recommended her to me, and I interviewed her personally.  Judge Gonzalez Rogers  is a tested  judge with a proven track record of  success and dedication to the northern  California community. It was my privilege to recommend her nomination to  President Obama.  She lives in Piedmont, CA. She and  her  husband  have  three  children—  Christopher, Maria, and Joshua.  Judge Gonzalez Rogers was born in  Houston, TX. Her parents were each  the oldest of nine siblings and grew up  in south Texas. Spanish was their first  language.  Her father served in the U.S. Army  and went to college with assistance  from the G.I. Bill.  Out of a large extended family, she  was one of only three family members  to attend college.  She earned her undergraduate degree  from Princeton University, where she  excelled, graduating cum laude in 1987.  During school breaks and weekends,  she spent her time cleaning houses and  cutting grass to help pay her tuition.  She attended law school at the University of California at Berkeley, ultimately earning her law degree from the  University of Texas at Austin.  She began the practice of law at the  prestigious San Francisco firm Cooley  LLP. At that time, no Latina woman  had been elected into the partnership  of any major San Francisco law firm.  In her own words, Judge Gonzalez  Rogers  ‘‘worked hard to break that  mold by becoming an excellent attorney worthy of invitation to the partnership.’’ She was elevated to Cooley’s  partnership in 1998.  In her application to my committee,  she described her story as the ‘‘American dream,’’ and she said that she  ‘‘would be honored to spend the remainder of  [her] professional career  serving  the country  that has given  [her] so much.’’  She currently serves as an Alameda  County  superior  court  judge. Judge  Gonzalez Rogers is an impressive jurist—smart,  personable,  and  with  mainstream views of the law—who I believe would serve very well as a Federal district judge.  On the Superior Court, she has presided over both a criminal and civil  calendar. She  currently  oversees  a  docket of more than 500 civil cases.  She has also been active in the community. She was appointed by the presiding judge to serve as foreperson of  the  Alameda  County  Civil  Grand  Jury—an  active  investigative  body  that examines complaints about the  administration of county government.  She served as cochair of Citizens for  Piedmont Schools, leading a campaign  to pass ballot measures for the benefit  of the local school systems. Each measure passed with over 80 percent of the  vote.  Her dedication to her community is  admirable, as is her dedication to the  law.  As she said in her own words, ‘‘I have  a deep respect for judicial leadership,  for judges who manage the process and  their courtrooms well, apply the law  fairly,  and  explain  their  reasoning  clearly. Reasonable  people  can  disagree. We need judges who will listen  and then decide. I hope to have a long  judicial career to live up to this standard.’’  I have no doubt she will live up to  that standard, and I strongly believe  she will be an outstanding Federal  judge.  The Judiciary Committee  reported  her nomination by voice vote in September, and I urge my colleagues to  vote to confirm her nomination today.  ",2011
2183,54,2011-11-15,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, I want  to express my strong support for California Superior Court Judge Yvonne  Gonzalez Rogers as the Senate prepares  to vote on her confirmation to the U.S.  District Court for the Central District  of California. Judge Gonzalez Rogers  was recommended to the President by  my colleague, Senator FEINSTEIN, and  will be a great addition to the Federal  bench.  (Mr.  Judge Gonzalez Rogers has been a  skilled lawyer and judge during her career. After graduating from the University of Texas School of Law, she practiced complex civil litigation at Cooley  Godward in San Francisco, becoming a  partner at the firm in 1999. In 2008, she  was appointed by then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to the Alameda  County Superior Court, where she currently serves. She has also served as regional president for the Hispanic National Bar Association.  I congratulate Judge Gonzalez Rogers and her family on this important  day and urge my colleagues in the Senate to join in voting to confirm this  highly qualified nominee to the Federal bench.  With that, Mr. President, I yield the  floor, and I suggest the absence of a  quorum.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  WEBB). The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the  roll.

2185,54,2011-11-15,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  ",2011
2186,54,2011-11-15,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, today the  Senate is going to finally consider two  of President Obama’s highly qualified  nominees to fill Federal district court  vacancies in Alaska and the Northern  District  of  California.  They  were  unanimously voted out by the Judiciary Committee 2 months ago. I am  sorry it has taken so long because of  objections on the other side, but I am  glad they now will be considered.  Both Sharon Gleason and Yvonne  Gonzalez Rogers have the strong support of their home State Senators and  both were reported by the Judiciary  Committee unanimously over 2 months  ago. I thank the majority leader for securing votes on their nominations. I  am disappointed that the Senate Republican leadership would not agree to  a vote on the other 23 judicial nominees waiting for final Senate action.  These delays are inexcusable and damaging.  All 25 nominees on the Senate calendar are qualified and have the support of their home State Senators, Republican and Democratic. Twenty-one  of  these  judicial  nominations were  unanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee. Senate Democrats are  prepared to have votes on all these important nominations.  I know of no  good reason why the Republican leadership is refusing to proceed on the 23  other judicial nominations that they  have stalled before the Senate.  The Senate Republican  leadership  has, again,  insisted that the Senate  skip over two circuit court nominees  who would fill judicial emergency vacancies on the Second and Ninth Circuit. They, too, were reported unanimously and have the support of their  home State Senators.

2210,61,2011-11-15,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I indicated  during the last week that I did not  want to have to fill the tree. It is unfortunate that an objection was raised.  We were able to move forward, as I indicated, in the last so-called minibus  with three appropriations bills made  into one. So we are now in a situation  where we have no way to move forward  unless we have an agreement on the  underlying bill, which is the Energy  and Water bill.  I have some knowledge of that bill. I  was on the Appropriations Committee  from the day I came to the Senate, and  I worked on that subcommittee  for  many  years—several  decades—and  I  was chairman of that subcommittee  quite a few times. I worked with Senator Domenici when we would go back  and forth as to who was the Chair, and  we worked extremely well together. We  were able to get the bill done quickly  and satisfy the needs of the Members of  this body.  If  I  can have  the  efforts of my  friends, Senator FEINSTEINand Senator  ALEXANDER, to move forward on this in  a way that we can have some view of  how we can end this legislation fairly  quickly, with  the  ability  to  have  amendments, I would have no problem  because, as I have indicated, we have a  lot of things to do before we leave here.  We cannot come back here in December with a lot of unfinished business. I  talked to my caucus today about the  Defense authorization bill. I think we  have to finish that bill before we leave  here for Thanksgiving. So we have the  minibus  conference  report, we now  have this Energy and Water appropriations bill, which I believe is so important, and we have, of course, the Defense authorization bill. So I say to everyone here, if we can work something  out, good. I hope we can.  ",2011

2216,68,2011-11-15,Mr. COATS.," Mr. President, we have  been  seized with obviously pressing  issues and emergencies, and I fear we  have not been paying enough attention  to the issue of Iran and the growing nuclear threat posed by that country. The  recent release of the report by the  International Atomic Energy Commission has  returned  the  Iran nuclear  issue to the front pages and, hopefully,  to the top of our list of priority issues  that need to be discussed and need to  be evaluated.  The IAEA nuclear watchdog, which I  visited  last March with a group of  Members of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, has never been  an instrument of U.S. policy. In fact, it  has often offered perspectives contrary  to America’s views or preferences and  has rigorously defended its objectivity  independent of individual governments.  Therefore, I think this  latest report  has all the more weight that we should  give serious consideration to. This objective organization of nuclear experts  has had unrivaled access to information and sources within Iran. It has  stripped away the veneer of ambiguity  and uncertainty about Iranian efforts  to develop nuclear weapons.  Iran is after the bomb, and we all  know it. We can see the proof in this  IAEA report, including compelling detail about Iran amassing fissile material, designing explosive  trigger devices, and developing delivery systems.  The report details the way in which  Iran has relentlessly pursued this objective over the years and from whom  it has obtained assistance.  The report also shows our own intelligence community’s official estimate  in 2007 that Iran had suspended these  activities in 2003 was wrong. The activities to design nuclear weapons soon  resumed and are continuing.  Ironically, it seems efforts to slow  down or halt nuclear weapons development  through  sanctions  or  even  through computer viruses have only  had minimal  or  temporary  effect.  Many have been unwisely comforted by  such delays and, therefore, have been  less focused and less determined to find  real solutions to this mortal security  threat.  Also, we have been mistakenly reassured by the contention that Iran has  not yet made the political decision to  actually  assemble  nuclear weapons.  This could potentially be one of the  most dangerous conclusions of all. As I  have repeatedly said  from this  floor  and during my tenure at the Bipartisan  Policy Center, a nuclear weapons-capable Iran is nearly as dangerous as a nuclear-armed  Iran. An  Iran  that has  spent years secretly pursuing—and now  we  know  successfully—the  technologies, the expertise, and materials  required to create nuclear weapons is a  threat to the United States and to the  world.  Facing this  imminent danger now,  with ample verification from the IAEA  that our anxieties are well-founded, is  absolutely essential.  It  is no  longer  possible to avoid the hard choices or  defer to the administration’s decisions.  In my opinion, there are only three  ways we can respond to this threat: We  can accept the inevitability of a nuclear Iran and learn to live with it—to  tolerate and try to contain this new  Iranian power; secondly, we can reluctantly take up the military option to  remove  the  threat—an option  three  Presidents have confirmed has always  been on the table; or, third, we can dramatically escalate the sanctions regimes to force Iranian compliance with  our collective international will.  The first option—tolerating a nuclear  weapons-capable  Iran—is not acceptable. As  I said, three previous U.S.  Presidents have unequivocally stated  this.  A  nuclear-armed  Iran  would  threaten the entire region and its enormous energy resources, motivate broad  nuclear proliferation  throughout  the  Middle East, further destabilize a region  already  in  turmoil,  encourage  radicalism and terrorism, and threaten  the destruction of the State of Israel.  This  last  danger  alone—to which  Israel, as a last resort, would most certainly respond to ensure its survival—  compels us to be clear-eyed and determined to find a viable solution. Toleration, I would suggest, is not a solution.  The second option—military action,  while always posed as a last resort following the failure of all other efforts—  must, in my opinion, remain on the  table. Our Nation and the international  community as a whole must see with  vivid clarity what measures  remain  should our other efforts continue to  fail. The Iranian regime must be especially nondelusional about those potential consequences, should it not change  its behavior. Indeed, to make all our efforts to find a solution credible, the  military option itself must be entirely  believable.  It is also essential to note that military options are not ours alone. There  is broad, open discussion now in Israel  and  elsewhere about whether  Israel  itself should act to remove this threat  to the survival of their state. This also  must be part of our own policy calculation.  As  former  Secretary  of  State  Condoleezza Rice said in a television  interview this weekend: ‘‘I don’t have  any doubt that the Israelis will defend  themselves if the Iranians look as if  they really are about to cross that nuclear threshold.’’  If there is any remaining doubt the  United States should not tolerate a nuclear  Iran,  I  think we can assume  Israel may not.  It is exactly to avoid this violent option that we must renew all our efforts  at finding other ways to force the Iranian regime to change its behavior, and  that includes compelling persuasion to  convince our  friends and allies—and  China and Russia as well—that united  efforts are essential.  We need a new dramatically tougher  sanctions regime, and we need it now.  If we don’t impose it now, it may very  well be too late.  I say this with some real reservations  about whether any new sanctions can  persuade the Iranian regime to change  its policy. If we truly believe a nuclear  weapons-capable Iran is unacceptable,  then the only logical response is to at  least prepare for a strike and send the  signal that the United States is prepared to act on what has been deemed  by, as I said, three Presidents as unacceptable.  I think it is contrary to U.S. interests to try to outsource this task to  the State of Israel, but I also think the  long-term danger is far greater than  the serious but shorter term negative  consequences of a strike.  Having said that, this force option  needs to be carefully considered, and I  think we need to continue whatever efforts we can make to prevent us from  having to ultimately choose that as  our only option.  So I am suggesting a new, dramatically tougher sanctions regime. It is  going  to have  to be  imposed very  quickly. Publicly released information  clearly  indicates  that  Iran  is much  closer to nuclear weapons capability  than  previously  acknowledged. We  must use the full focused power of our  diplomatic instrument not to persuade  Iran—that has clearly been a total failure to date—but to persuade other nations  that  immediate,  tough,  new  international sanctions are the only  way to prevent us from having to go to  an option which none of us wishes to go  to.

2217,75,2011-11-15,Mr. BLUMENTHAL.," Mr. President,  today I wish to recognize and honor the  life and legacy of Casey Ribicoff, an inspiration, role model and friend to me  and so many others.  Casey Ribicoff was a living legend.  She and Abe shared a love that was  heartfelt and moving, and obvious to  all who knew them. She brought laughter and elegance to every friendship,  most especially to her partnership with  Abe. Together they traveled the world  and country, making new friendships  and visiting old ones, all the while creating enough memories to last a lifetime.  Having served on the Abe Ribicoff  Senate staff, I can attest to their extraordinary partnership in public service, her deep caring for the people of  Connecticut, and her commitment to  social justice. She regarded the Senate  as a platform for advocacy and hard  work on behalf of Connecticut and the  public interest. She and Abe were truly  a team.  Casey had an impressive energy and  strength. She was constantly involved  in good causes, leading to her appointment by Jimmy Carter to the board of  the Kennedy Center, a position  she  proudly held for 20 years. A founder of  the AIDS Care Center at the New York  Presbyterian Hospital, Casey always  found new ways to give back and help  the community.  As a personal friend, which she was  to Cynthia and me, she was endlessly  loyal and generous, and she leaves a  legacy of good work that will be remembered for decades to come. Casey  was kind, generous and loving. She will  live on in the friendships and family  that she cherished. She will be sorely  missed but never forgotten.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  GOODWILL INDUSTRIES OF NEW  MEXICO  ∑",2011
2218,75,2011-11-15,Mr.  BINGAMAN.,"  Mr.  President,  today I wish to recognize the 70th anniversary of Goodwill Industries of New  Mexico. Working in New Mexico communities since 1941, the organization  has helped  find work and provided  training and development for countless  needy New Mexicans.  The nonprofit organization provides  essential  skill  development,  career-  building services, and work opportunities to residents facing serious employment barriers. This is an especially important service they provide considering the continuing difficulties facing  many applicants in today’s job market.  Despite high unemployment and a  struggling economy, Goodwill  Industries of New Mexico placed nearly 850  clients in public and private sector jobs  last year. Many of these clients face  challenges with  various  disabilities,  homelessness, drug addiction, and traumatic brain injuries, among other barriers. And the impact of the organization’s activities has been felt throughout the entire State. In 2010, Goodwill  Industries  served nearly  10,000  residents through 8 programs reaching all  33 counties. That is a tenfold increase  from a decade ago.  Much  of  its  funding  is  derived  through its retail stores, with 87 cents  of every dollar spent on programs and  services. But last year alone, in addition to its retail sales, Goodwill Industries of New Mexico salvaged nearly  1,700 tons of textiles, 188 tons of shoes,  recycled  536  tons of  cardboard and  paper, and kept nearly 35 tons of used  electronics out of New Mexico landfills.  The environmental  impact of Goodwill’s initiatives is making a positive  difference as well.  The education and training programs  provide intensified training to those in  need at six training centers across the  State. Their programs also help low-income seniors to market themselves and  acquire skills to compete in today’s job  market and place individuals in subsidized jobs with a host agency with  the goal of moving that employee into  a permanent position within the community.  Its Pathways programs assist  the  near homeless and chronically homeless in obtaining access to housing and  the opportunity to begin a new  life  through the power of work. Goodwill  Industries’ GoodGuides Mentoring Program pairs adults with at risk teens.  Mentors provide structure and a supportive relationship with middle and  high  school-aged  students. Goodwill  volunteers work with teens to establish  goals, build career plans, and work toward high school graduation to prepare  for postsecondary training or college.  Traumatic brain injuries often leave  patients  confused  and  bewildered,  struggling  with  simple  day-to-day  tasks. The caring staff in the TBI case  management program assisted over 500  clients in crisis last year from imminent risk to their safety and health. I  was also pleased to announce in July  that this highly respected organization  received over a $1⁄2million grant from  the VA to prevent homelessness among  New Mexican veterans and their families.  Mr. President, I join Goodwill Industries of New Mexico in celebrating its  70th anniversary, and I congratulate  them on being one of my State’s premier service providers advocating for  the  disabled,  homeless,  and  unemployed.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO ROBERT AND  MARGARET PATRICELLI  ∑",2011
2219,75,2011-11-15,Mr. BLUMENTHAL.," Mr. President,  today I wish to commend Robert and  Margaret Patricelli, of Simsbury, CT,  for their immense generosity and vision in establishing an institute that  will promote and support  important  public service activities.  Public policy and service have played  a central role in the Patricelli’s careers and lives. Graduating from Wesleyan in 1961 and Harvard Law in 1965,  Bob was selected as one of 15 people for  the  first White House Fellows Program. His participation helped shape  him as someone who understands the  value of public policy and government  service. Both he and Margaret are always looking for ways to give back and  inspire others.  Their passion  for giving back and  helping others is what moved them to  start  the  Robert  and  Margaret  Patricelli Family Foundation to bring  a  tangible  reality  to programs and  projects that serve the greater good.  What Bob and Margaret have done  through their family’s foundation is inspiring and moving—and will continue  to serve the country, and the world, for  generations  to  come. Their  philanthropic  and  service  activities  have  touched  countless  lives  across  the  State, from the arts to science, hospitals to schools, and programs assisting low-income neighborhoods.  In May of this year, the foundation  contributed substantially to Wesleyan  University, establishing the Patricelli  Center  for Social Entrepreneurship.  This center will support students seeking to establish programs and organizations, providing workshops, speakers  and networking opportunities for students. It will help encourage and embolden students who are focused on becoming social entrepreneurs, as well as  award grants  to undergraduate  students engaged in specific projects. The  foundation’s most recent contribution  to Wesleyan is one more example of  great caring and commitment that lead  me to recognize Bob and Margaret for  all that they have done for our State  and country.  A role model and inspiration to all  who value public service, I commend  and thank Bob and Margaret Patricelli  for their legacy of great work for Connecticut and the country.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO JONATHAN M.

2222,215,2011-11-15,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor of the Cleveland Mediation Center as it  celebrates its 30th anniversary. The Mediation  Center has provided an essential  forum  for  dialogue and communication which has  fostered cooperation and peace within the community. It has proven especially valuable for  the city’s youth, who often lack the voice to  raise their concerns about problems which directly affect them.  The Center began as the Community Youth  Mediation program in 1981. Focusing on the  Near West Side community of Cleveland, this  organization  became  the  first  grass-roots  youth oriented mediation program in the country. The Center provided guidance  to  thousands of  individuals and helped  to address  issues of truancy, school violence, and cases  of abuse and neglect. Two of  the programs  developed by the Center would go on to be  used by both the Juvenile Court and Cleveland Public Schools.  Following these successes, the Center was  utilized in engaging the city at large. By 1992,  it had expanded its youth centered approach  to include issues such as neighbor to neighbor  mediation and  training. Homelessness has  also been one of the Center’s major concerns,  particularly  in addressing discrepancies between  the  city’s homeless population and  services provided by city agencies. Today, the  Cleveland Mediation Center continues  their  mission of promoting constructive conflict resolution, especially among youth, and strengthening community  ties with an emphasis on  mediation and mediation training.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me  in honoring the Cleveland Mediation Center in  celebrating their important role as facilitators  within  their communities and enabling  fellow  citizens  to work  through  their  conflicts  in  peaceful and constructive ways.  f  COAST GUARD AND MARITIME  TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2011  SPEECHOF  HON.

2223,215,2011-11-15,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Mr. Chair, I  rise today to support H.R. 2838, the ‘‘Coast  Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of  2011.’’ This legislation authorizes funding for  the Coast Guard through fiscal year 2014 and  authorizes service strength of 47,000 active  duty personnel.  As a Senior Member on the Committee on  Homeland Security and the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, I understand the  importance of protecting our maritime borders.  In our post 9/11 climate, homeland security  continues to be a top priority for our nation.  In 1787, Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist  Paper Number 12 laid the foundation for the  modern Coast Guard when he noted that ‘‘[a]  few armed vessels, judiciously stationed at the  entrances of our ports, might at a small expense, be made useful sentinels of our laws.’’  I believe protecting our country by air, land,  and sea is critical to our national security interests. As Coast Guard is beneficial to our maritime interests, and consequently, our national  security  it  is  imperative  that we provide  the  Coast Guard with the funding they need.  In the aftermath of September 11, 2001 the  focus of many federal agencies shifted to include an  increased emphasis on Homeland  Security. Under the Homeland Security Act of  2002, a number of security missions were assigned to the Coast Guard. Without question  the first mission of our Coast Guard has been  to protect our ports, waterways and to focus  on coastal security. They have completed this  mission with honor for centuries.  Across the United States there are currently  more than 350 major ports of which 23 are located in my home state of Texas.  I am honored  to represent  the 18th Congressional District which includes the Port of  Houston, one of our nation’s busiest ports.  More  than 220 million  tons of cargo moved  through the Port of Houston in 2010 and it has  been ranked as first in foreign waterborne tonnage for the 15th consecutive year.  The port links Houston with over 1,000 ports  located  in  203  countries,  and  provides  785,000  jobs  throughout  the state of Texas.  Maritime ports are major centers of  trade,  commerce,  and  travel  along  our  nation’s  coastline. All of these ports are protected by  the Coast Guard.  As a Representative from Texas, a border  state, I am extremely concerned with curtailing  the  flow of  illegal drugs entering  into  the  United States. The Coast Guard is the lead  federal agency for maritime drug interdiction.  Houston has been classified by the Office of  National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) as a  High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, and in a  2009 report, the ONDCP expressed concern  that ‘‘the sheer volume of maritime traffic and  foreign cargo that passes through the port offers another avenue for drug smuggling.’’  The Coast Guard is responsible for and has  coordinated with other federal, state, and local  agencies and countries within  the  region  to  disrupt and deter the flow of illegal drugs into  Houston and other ports. This coordinated effort has resulted in a decrease in the supply  of illicit substances being transported all over  the country.  The Coast Guard protects the interests of  American citizens and American commerce  abroad. Last year, 73.2 million tons of exports  left the Port of Houston to be sold to countries  around the world. These exports represented  $70.8 billion dollars, and countless American  jobs.  The international counter—piracy efforts of  the Coast Guard focus on preventing attacks  of piracy  that  threaten American commercial  vessels and cargo. The Coast Guard also performs vital counter terrorism measures in ports  abroad  to ensure  the safety of Americans  across the globe.  In addition, in Houston the Coast Guard routinely conducts integrated operations with city,  county, state and Federal Law Enforcement  partners. The joint agency Houston Area Maritime Operations Center is a prime example of  the type of coordination efforts directed under  a  recent Maritime Operations Coordination  Plan signed by  the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) and  U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE).  The Port of Houston as one of the world’s  busiest ports  is a  tremendous  responsibility  which has been smoothly operated by  the  Coast Guard. In terms of maritime traffic and  cargo, the Port of Houston ranks first in the  nation for number of ship arrivals and second  in total cargo tonnage. Houston handles over  50 percent of all containerized cargo arriving  at Gulf of Mexico ports.  Houston is the Energy capitol of the United  States for a reason, more than 50 percent of  the gasoline used in the United States is refined in this area. With more than 100 petrochemical waterfront facilities, Houston has the  second  largest such complex  in  the world.  Major  corporations  such  as  Exxon-Mobil,  Shell, Saudi ARAMCO, Stolt Nielson, Odfjell  USA Inc., Sea River and Kirby Marine have  national or international headquarters in Houston.

2224,222,2011-11-15,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor of the 60th Anniversary of the Korean  War Commemoration Committee as they recognize Korean Veterans on November 11,  2011, Veterans Day.  The Korean War began on June 25, 1950  when  the North Korean People’s Army  invaded the Republic of Korea. The Korean War  was the first ‘‘hot’’ conflict of the Cold War and  included historic battles and offensives as well  as  important  technological and medical advances. On July 27, 1953, the United States,  North Korea and China signed an armistice. A  total of 33,651 U.S. service members died in  battle during  the Korean War; 27,709 U.S.  Army; 4,269 U.S. Marines; 1,198 U.S. Air  Force; and 475 U.S. Navy. Seven thousand,  one-hundred and forty Service Members became prisoners of war.  The Korean War Commemoration Committee’s mission is to honor the service and sacrifice of Korean War Veterans, American service members, and their allies who fought heroically to preserve Freedom; to commemorate  the key events of the Korean War; and educate  the American people about  the significance of the Korean War.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me  in honor of the 60th Anniversary of the Korean  War Commemoration Committee as they pay  special  tribute  to  the more  than 6.8 million  servicemen and women who bravely fought in  the Korean War.  f  COAST GUARD AND MARITIME  TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 2011  SPEECHOF  HON. JOHN L. MICA  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 4, 2011  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the state of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 2838) to authorize  appropriations for the Coast Guard for fiscal  years 2012 through 2015, and for other purposes:  ",2011
2225,222,2011-11-15,Mr. MICA.," Mr. Chair, H.R. 2838, the Coast  Guard and Maritime Transportation Act 2011,  authorizes Coast Guard  funding  for Fiscal  Years 2012, 2013 and 2014. The authorized  levels were approved  in  the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee’s Budget Views  and Estimates, and reflect the levels set in the  House-passed Budget Resolution.  Following up on the Committee’s Sitting on  Our Assets Report, H.R. 2838 decommissions  two aging  icebreakers, neither of which currently operates. The bill also restricts the purchases of  future National Security Cutters  (NSCs) until current NSCs meet  long-promised mission performance capabilities.  In addition to authorizing the Coast Guard  and making  improvements  to  the service’s  programs and capabilities,  the bill also  improves the administration of maritime transportation, including—clarifying the circumstances  under which a foreign seaman injured outside  the United States can sue  in United States  courts.  The bill incorporates H.R. 2840, the Commercial Vessel Discharges Reform Act  of  2011. H.R. 2840 establishes a uniform national standard  for ballast water discharges.  This provision  is strongly supported by  the  U.S. and international maritime industry. It protects  the environment and makes maritime  transportation more efficient.  H.R. 2838 also  incorporates an amended  version of H.R. 2839, the Piracy Suppression  Act of 2011, which authorizes additional actions to suppress piracy. It also improves the  tracking of ransom payments to pirates to assure these payments do not fund terrorism.  This bill promotes maritime safety and security and make makes maritime  commerce  more efficient. I urge my colleagues to vote  ‘‘aye’’ on H.R. 2838.  OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL  DEBT  HON.

2227,222,2011-11-15,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  celebrate  the 90th birthday of dear beloved  spiritual leader, Chief Apostle William L. Bonner at the National Church of Our Lord Jesus  Christ (COOLJC) Day at the Greater Refuge  Temple in Harlem. Let me also note that on  Saturday, November 5, 2011, the Greater Refuge Temple, which is the ‘‘Mother Church’’ of  the Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, paid  special tribute to Bishop Bonner’s 50 years of  service and pastoral leadership to the greater  COOLJC  church  family  and  community  throughout our great Nation.  Founded by the late apostle Bishop Robert  C. Lawson, D.D., LL.D., The Church of Our  Lord Jesus Christ had its inception in the year  1919. Bishop Lawson, then Elder Lawson was  invited  to a prayer meeting, which was  in  progress  in a basement  in  the 40th Street  area of New York City. So energetic was his  service  to  the Lord  that his  fame spread  abroad and reached the ears of Mr. and Mrs.  James Burleigh and Mr. and Mrs. Edward Anderson. These  two blessed couples opened  their homes to Elder Lawson and their home  today is affectionately thought of as the ‘‘Cradle of the Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ’’.  Within a short period, the congregation outgrew  its place of worship, having approximately 200 members, and larger quarters had  to be sought. Bishop Lawson purchased the  sight at 52–54–56 West 133 Street and relocated his thriving church. It was there that his  vision was enlarged and the Lord lay upon his  heart to conduct a tent revival and great numbers were added to the church.  Under  the  thriving ministry  of  Apostle  Lawson, many preachers, missionaries, and  teachers were sent into the field establishing  numerous works. To the far-flung isles of the  sea, to the continent of Africa and to the Caribbean, these Christian heralds went carrying  the apostolic message.  It was  in  the year  1932, that Bishop Lawson initiated the radio  broadcast over the stations WGBS. He broadcasted successfully over WHOM and WINS.  The broadcast  is presently continuing over  station WBNX every Sunday evening.  In August of 1945, as the church out grew  its quarters on 133rd Street, Bishop Lawson  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:45 Nov 16, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A15NO8.024 E15NOPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

2230,9,2011-11-28,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  THEECONOMY  ",2011
2231,9,2011-11-28,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I listened to part of what Senator REIDhad  to say as we opened the Senate today.  I was struck by the fact that so many  people are unemployed and our economy is still barely growing, that there  probably is not any firm objection to  trying to alleviate some of the pain by  continuing a process where we lessen  the tax burden through a decline in the  Social Security tax. I don’t think that  is going to be the issue with many Senators.  The question is, do we do that by  raising taxes on other people or by getting rid of waste. I had an interesting  phone call today with somebody I trust  and have been talking to for 3 years,  who actually predicted everything that  has happened so far. He predicted what  is going to happen in Europe, and he  predicted  the  fact  that  ultimately  there will be default in Europe on government bonds. There is no way they  grow themselves out of it or no way we  loan them enough money to buy them  enough time to get out of it. The only  way is to trim their spending, which  they should have started 21⁄2or 3 years  ago.  The same lesson applies to us. I think  some things that are factual ought to  be brought up. We had, over this past  week, the inability of the committee to  come to an agreement on $1.2 trillion.  Therefore, there is going to be a sequestration. The interesting thing, on  the way to the farm, is that when you  have  the  sequestration  carried out,  there will actually be no decrease in  spending in the Federal Government.  This is the important thing I want the  American people to hear. They think  we are cutting spending. Defense will  rise 16 percent with sequestration; nondefense discretionary will rise 6 percent; Medicare will still rise 71 percent;  and net interest will rise 160 percent  with the sequestration. So it is dishonest—to put it mildly—to say that  we  are  cutting  anything  in Washington. And there begs the problem.  The problem  is  that  the political  elite  in  this country are  failing  to  make  the  adjustments we have  to  make or we are going to end up like  Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and ultimately France. We have to do that.  The sooner we do it the less pain we  are going to have. The first thing we  ought  to do  is be honest with  the  American  people. Nobody has  done  anything in Washington yet to cut any  spending, because it is still going to  rise  in discretionary, defense, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest. It is still going to rise. So we  have to go back to the fundamental  problem.  What President Obama is proposing  costs about $240 billion for next year. I  think he would get great support from  many of us if he said I want to do this  to help people out there, and I want to  do it by getting rid of some of the  waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication we  have. I would be the first to help him.  But that is not what is going to be proposed. Instead of playing the political  game, why don’t we solve the problem?  We had a GAO report that came out  in March that showed massive duplication throughout the Federal Government—massive. My estimate is close to  $200 billion a year. That is not theirs,  that is mine. But at a minimum, $100  billion a year could be saved by consolidating programs and eliminating  duplication. We have not done anything or made any attempt to do that.  Senator WARNER and  I  offered  an  amendment to eliminate $5 billion of  it. The bill it was riding on was withdrawn. We haven’t had an opportunity  in all the bills that came before to  offer an amendment to eliminate duplication. Before we ask anybody to pay  more taxes to offset the taxes we are  going to decrease  for the businesses  under $50 million, and for the decline in  the payment of Social Security tax of  3.1 percent for business and 2 percent  for the individual, we ought to get our  house in order first. We are doing exactly what  the European  countries  refuse to do.  Now we hear over the weekend that  we are about to participate, through  the IMF, in socializing the debt of Europe, of which we are required, through  the IMF, to absorb 26 percent of the  cost. We are not going to let that happen, because what we are going to do is  exactly the same thing we are doing in  the cities—delaying the onset of the  time to make the hard choices.  Here  is the growth curve on this  chart. In the red is sequestration. The  blue  line  is without  sequestration.  Spending is still going up. We are going  to be at a $5.4 trillion annual budget in  2021, 9 years from now. No spending has  been cut. We need to quit lying to the  American people about what we are  doing. A 9-percent approval rating is  well earned as long as we are dishonest  with the American people about what  we are actually doing. They understand  the problem. We are broke.  If you don’t think that is the case,  look at this chart. Medicare is broke,  no  question  about  it. Medicaid  is  broke. The census is broke. Fannie and  Freddie are broke. Now FHA has 0.2  percent of the capital they need when  they have a minimum statutory requirement of 3 percent. FHA is broke.  Social Security is broke. There is $2.6  trillion in the trust fund. We put $105  billion from the Treasury in to offset  what we did  last year. Now we are  going to pay for it twice because there  was no decrease in the IOU. For that  $105 billion, our children and grandchildren will pay back  $210 billion.  With the new program, they are going  to pay back $280 billion. The U.S. Post  Office is dead broke. We won’t even  pass a bill that allows it to be fixed. We  just delay the time of its demise. Cash  for Clunkers was broke. The highway  trust fund was broke. We are passing  bills for the highway trust fund, which  is $13 billion short. We don’t know  where the money will come from because the trust fund is broke. Government-run health care—we don’t know,  but it is likely to be broke before it  starts.  How do we solve the problem?  ",2011

2240,16,2011-11-28,Mr.  GRASSLEY.,"  Mr.  President,  today we in the Senate will confirm  Judge Christopher Droney to be U.S.  Circuit Judge, Second Circuit. This  will be the fifth nominee of President  Obama to be confirmed to this circuit,  the Second Circuit. In  just 3 years,  President Obama  has matched  the  number of President Bush’s nominees  confirmed to the Second Circuit over  his entire 8 years in office.  With this vote, the Senate will have  confirmed 57 article III judicial nominees during this Congress. This is a  great accomplishment considering only  six sessions of Congress in the last 30  years have  confirmed more  judicial  nominees. In total, over 71 percent of  President Obama’s  judicial nominees  have been confirmed.  The seat to which Judge Droney is  nominated has been deemed to be a judicial emergency. This will be the 31st  judicial emergency nominee to be confirmed this year. This seat became vacant in July 2009 when Judge Calabresi  took senior status. The President first  nominated Judge Chatigny to this vacancy. Judge Chatigny is a sitting U.S.  district judge in Connecticut. However,  after reviewing his record the Senate  determined  that  Judge  Chatigny  should not be elevated, and his nomination was returned to the White House  at the end of the 111th Congress. The  President did not renominate Judge  Chatigny and instead sent us the nomination of the person we are considering  today, Judge Droney.  I raise this bit of history to remind  the Senate and those who watch our  proceedings of the importance of the  role of advice and consent by the Senate, necessary for someone to become a  judge. We in the Senate and historically  are  not  here  to  simply  rubberstamp the President’s nominees.  Even as we give the President’s nominees a thorough review, we are doing so  in a very reasonable timeframe. During  President Bush’s administration, circuit nominees were forced to wait on  average 247 days for a hearing. President Obama’s circuit court nominees  have had their hearings on average in  just 66 days. The same can be said of  President Bush’s district court nominees, who waited 120 days compared to  only 79 days for President Obama’s district court nominees.  In addition, we have reported nominees in a more timely manner. Circuit  court nominees have been reported on  average in just 113 days compared to  369 days for President Bush’s nominees.  President Obama’s district court nominees have been reported in just 128 days  compared  to  148 days  for President  Bush’s nominees.  Furthermore, for those who still contend that President Bush’s nominees  are being treated unfairly, let me point  out that we have reported a higher percentage of judicial nominees to the full  Senate compared to this point in President Bush’s Presidency. Seventy-six  percent of President Obama’s judicial  nominees have been reported to date.  At this point in President Bush’s Presidency only 71 percent were reported.  Having set the record straight on the  work and progress of this committee, I  will  tell my  colleagues why  they  should vote for Judge Droney to be a  circuit judge for the Second Circuit.  Upon graduation from the University  of Connecticut School of Law, and that  was in 1979, Judge Droney joined the  Hartford firm of Day, Berry & Howard  and was responsible for civil matters  such as personal injury defense, product liability, antitrust and corporate  disputes. In 1981, Judge Droney joined  the law department of Aetna Life &  Casualty for a brief period, working on  investment matters.

2241,23,2011-11-28,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, I wish to  honor Harry Pachon, one of our Nation’s most dedicated scholars and civil  rights leaders, who passed away on November 4, 2011.  Harry Pachon was born to immigrant  parents in Miami, FL, in 1945 and spent  part of his childhood in Colombia. He  returned to the United States, where  he  completed  high  school  in  Montebello, CA, and earned a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in  political science from California State  University, Los Angeles, and a Ph.D. in  government from Claremont Graduate  University.  Mr. Pachon dedicated his life to public service and fought tirelessly to elevate the role of the Latino community  in politics. After serving as the chief of  staff  for Los Angeles Representative  Edward R. Roybal, Harry became a  founding board member and executive  director of the National Association of  Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.  Beginning in 1993, Mr. Pachon became  the president of the Toma´s Rivera Policy Institute in California. Under his  leadership,  the  institute  conducted  groundbreaking research on key issues  facing the Latino community, including immigration, education, and political  participation,  and  brought national  attention  to  the  needs  of  Latinos. In 2003, the institute moved to  the University of Southern California,  where Harry was a beloved and respected professor of public policy.  I invite all of my colleagues to join  me in honoring Harry Pachon and extending our deepest condolences to his  wife Barbara; his children, Marc, Melissa, Nicholas, and Andrew; and his  four grandchildren. He will be deeply  missed.∑  f  REMEMBERING DANIEL G. MCKAY  ∑",2011
2242,23,2011-11-28,Mrs. MCCASKILL.," Mr. President,  today I wish to honor the life of Daniel  G. McKay who passed away on November 10, 2011. It is with deep sorrow that  I offer my condolences, to his wife  Sharron for the loss of her beloved husband, to his two sons: Dan Jr. and  Mark, and to his three grandchildren;  Jesse, Dana and Danny.  A native of St. Louis, MO, Dan grew  up  in north St. Louis and attended  Central High School. He began his career after high school as a truck driver  and worked for over 30 years as a driver  for several local companies.  Dan assumed leadership in the Teamsters and spent much of his life and career working tirelessly to secure the  rights of working men and women.  Within Teamsters’ Local 600, Dan held  several leadership positions including  business representative, recording secretary and President. His passion for  helping others also led Dan to become  President of Teamsters Joint Council  13  in  2002,  representing  over  25,000  Teamster  families  in Missouri. Dan  also held several positions in the Missouri Kansas Nebraska Conference of  Teamsters. He retired from both Local  600 and Joint Council 13 in March, 2010.  It is with great humility and respect  that I honor Dan today. His dedicated  leadership improved the work experience for many Missourians, and under  Dan’s leadership the Teamsters organized and educated workers so they  would know their workplace rights and  could participate  fully  in our democratic society.  Dan touched the lives of many, and  improved the quality of life in the community  at  large. The  International  Brotherhood of Teamsters has lost a  friend and an advocate, and I have lost  a dear friend, advisor, and confidant.  Dan was afraid of no one when it  came to defending his friends or confronting his adversaries. When I explained to him one time that his political support of me was going to cause  him trouble, he said, ‘‘Nothing that I  can’t handle. We are in this together.’’  Dan will certainly be remembered for  his gruff but engaging personality as  well as for his many accomplishments.  Dan was tough, but under that tough  exterior was a huge heart filled with  love for his family, for his community  and  for his brothers and  sisters  in  labor.  Dan’s life and commitment to others  serve as an inspiration to me and to all  Missourians. Our State has truly lost a  leader and a hero.  I extend my deepest sympathies and  sincerest condolences to Dan’s family  in their time of bereavement, and I invite the Senate to join me in honoring  the life and accomplishments of this  son of Missouri.∑  f  REPORT  RELATIVE  TO  THE  ISSUANCE  OF  AN  EXECUTIVE  ORDER  TO  TAKE  ADDITIONAL  STEPS WITH RESPECT TO THE  NATIONAL  EMERGENCY  ORIGINALLY DECLARED ON MARCH 15,  1995  IN EXECUTIVE ORDER  12957  WITH  RESPECT  TO  IRAN,  RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT  OF THE SENATE ON NOVEMBER  21, 2011—PM 35  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message  from  the President  of  the United  States, together with an accompanying  report; which was referred to the Committee  on  Banking,  Housing,  and  Urban Affairs:  To the Congress of the United States:  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.  1701 et seq.)

2245,6,2011-12-08,Mr. POLIS.," I yield myself such time  as I may consume, Madam Speaker.  We get it and the American people  get it. Just because you repeat something enough times doesn’t make  it  true.  What businesses need in this country  is  long-term  certainty  and  predictability, a fair playing field with clear  rules for all. And yet here we are with  a bill like this creating more uncertainty  by  introducing  ambiguously  drafted  bills  and  new  ambiguously  drafted standards that skew the rules  in favor of some and against others,  making  it  tougher and  tougher  for  small  business,  entrepreneurs,  and  innovators who don’t have teams of  lobbyists in Washington, D.C., monitoring every bit of legislation to get by  and succeed.  The American people understand it  wasn’t the Environmental Protection  Agency that caused this recession, that  caused this economic mess we’re  in,  and the economic recovery won’t come  through creating  loopholes  in public  health laws.  If we are serious about helping farmers, there’s plenty that we could be  doing. But increasing industrial pollution  for mining and coal processing  isn’t something that farmers in my district and across Colorado have asked  me to do.  Farmers are concerned about many  real-life challenges. Farmers are concerned that their kids can’t get financing to go carry on the family business  because the startup and liability costs  are too high. Farmers are concerned  about the estate tax.  Farmers are concerned about getting  sued by Monsanto because their crops  were contaminated by Roundup Ready  pollen. Farmers are concerned about  rapid swings in commodity prices because of instability in the market. Political brinksmanship and gridlock create market instability, and bills that  create corporate handouts, loopholes,  and more uncertainty  like this one  aren’t helping farmers, they’re hurting  farmers, and they aren’t helping the  rest of the country either.  In addition to ignoring the needs of  farmers, this bill ignores our national  debt. In fact, it ignores our own House  protocols  to  pay  for  things. Oddly  enough,  not  regulating  this  nonexistent  regulation  isn’t  cheap. Because of the bureaucratic changes that  would ensue from this bill, the nonpartisan CBO has scored this bill as  costing  the Federal Government  $10  million. So this bill violates the Republican rule for discretionary authorizations.  In  fact, while  the majority  has  pledged to adhere to spending limits on  all indirect spending bills by including  RECORD offsetting language, this bill includes  no offsetting language, which is particularly  grating  because  this  bill  doesn’t actually do anything besides  create more Federal bureaucrats.  Madam Speaker, with only one committee hearing and a quick vote, this  bill shouldn’t be before us on the floor  today. We have real work to do. We  need a good-faith effort to get to the  bottom of the real issues that affect  this country and caused the recession,  and help the middle class. This bill is  not aimed at doing anything for farmers. It’s not even aimed at a real problem.  I urge my colleagues to follow the  House CutGo guidelines, to table this  bill and focus on the real problems we  should be working on. We all must stop  pretending the answer to this country’s  problems is giving handouts and loopholes to those with the most lobbyists  here in Washington, D.C.  As  I mentioned  earlier, Madam  Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule.  I ask unanimous consent to insert  the  text of  the amendment  in  the  along with extraneous material immediately prior to the vote on  the previous question.  ",2011

2247,6,2011-12-08,Mr. POLIS.," Madam Speaker, I urge  my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ and defeat  the previous question so that we can do  the right thing for working families  and the millions of people looking for a  job and vote on an unemployment extension and a payroll tax holiday and  extension before we leave for next year,  3 more weeks.  I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011
2248,6,2011-12-08,Mr. WEBSTER.," Madam Speaker,  yield myself the balance of my time.  This bill provides for ample open debate, allowing for the colleagues here  on this floor and across the aisle, both  on our side and theirs, to offer amendments to this bill.  The underlying bill isn’t particularly  controversial. As a matter of fact, it’s  rather simple. This bill has no effect on  direct spending. It does not appropriate  any money or have any new appropriation in it at all. This bill creates no  new programs. It has nothing to do  with CutGo or pay-as-you-go, either  way. It doesn’t do either.  In the end, I can’t imagine 186 different groups being so stirred up in this  country to write and to call and to ask  for this legislation, groups like the National Corn Growers Association and  the Sheep Growers Association and the  Association of Cooperatives and  the  Farm Bureaus across this country and  the American Soybean Association and  many, many more getting stirred up  about nothing?  No, that argument is heifer dust. It  is. This argument is real, it’s true, and  it’s right, and it’s absolutely just like  I  in EPA  in many  what’s happening  other areas.  The underlying bill, as I said, is quite  simple. It provides much-needed certainty in the short term for agricultural, ranching, and rural businesses  by hitting pause on the EPA’s runaway  regulatory machine for just one measure for just 1 year.  H.R. 1633 simply says that now is not  the time to thrust yet another burdensome, costly and, in EPA’s own judgment, unnecessary regulation on rural  job creators. In the long term, it offers  regulatory relief to rural America by  acknowledging that States and  local  communities are better suited to manage dust in their own communities and  thus grant them the flexibility to do  so.  It’s  particularly  offensive  because  it’s like the old cookie-cutter approach  that Washington uses, the same program that’s good for Ocoee, Florida, is  good for Butte, Montana, and inner-  city New York, and  it’s wrong. We  ought to get rid of the cookie-cutter  approach and go back to local communities and State governments and let  them solve their problems, as opposed  to  one-size-fits-all  Federal Government.  Given  the  state  of  the  economy,  given  the EPA administrator’s own  comments about the lack of need to  further regulate farm dust, given the  dearth of scientific evidence that says  that this is a danger, there is some sort  of danger from farm dust, this legislation represents a commonsense effort  to create an environment for job creation that all Members should support.  It gives farmers, ranchers, and other  rural small business owners the certainty, at least when it comes to dust,  that  costly  regulations would  not  shackle their ability to focus on growing their business, providing for their  families, and  creating much needed  jobs in rural America.  I ask my colleagues to join me in  voting in favor of the rule and passage  of the underlying bill.  The material previously referred to  by Mr. POLISis as follows:  ANAMENDMENTTOH.

2249,13,2011-12-08,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I am  pleased to yield 5 minutes to the leading Democrat on  the Energy Committee, the ranking member, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RUSH).  ",2011
2250,13,2011-12-08,Mr. RUSH.," I want to thank the ranking member for his outstanding leadership and for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this ill-conceived, nonsensical, and  in all ways  awful bill, H.R. 1633, which could have  a devastating effect on the EPA’s ability to enforce the Clean Air Act on the  basis  of  both  procedural  and  substantive grounds.  Mr. Chairman, the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, scored this bill  and determined that it would cost $10  million in discretionary spending over  a 5-year period for the EPA to cover  the cost of carrying out changes to existing emission control standards, as  well as other activities to study the  need and feasibility of modifying the  EPA’s national monitoring network for  particulate matter, as  this bill  requires.  Since this $10 million is not appropriated anywhere in this bill, this bill  would  directly  violate  the  discretionary CutGo policy that this majority, that my friends on the other side,  voted for that they put in place at the  beginning of this Congress.  If we pass this bill, it will be the  height of hypocrisy for this atrocious  bill to get through this House.  Additionally, Mr. Chairman, on the  issue of substance, I oppose this bill because  it would dramatically weaken  the Clean Air Act by eliminating the  EPA’s ability to regulate particulate  matter from a broad range of sources,  as well as jeopardize existing State and  Federal regulations that apply to fine  and coarse particulate matter.  Although the title of this bill suggests that  it only covers dust  from  farms, this bill creates a whole new  broad, new nonscientific category of  pollution  called  ‘‘nuisance  dust,’’  which it would exempt from the Clean  Air Act  completely. Nuisance  dust  would be exempted from the Clean Air  Act  totally without  any  basis  and  science, no scientific evidence whatsoever; and in doing so, this bill would do  harm to the public’s health.  The  bill would  exempt  from  the  Clean Air Act any particulate matter  pollution that is emitted from sources  such as open-pit mines, mining processing plants, sand and gravel mines,  smelters, coal mines, coal-processing  plants, cement kilns, and waste and recovery facilities. These very facilities  emit fine particulates, coarse particulates, arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium,  zinc, chromium, and other heavy metals—all of which would fall under this  bill’s broad exemption from the Clean  Air Act.  Mr. Chairman, as the American Lung  Association noted, under the provisions  of this bill, our country’s most vulnerable populations—poor people, people  who depend on the EPA to protect  them  from  the  harmful  effects  of  coarse particulates will be most affected.  Children, teens, senior citizens, low-  income people, people with  chronic  lung disease such as asthma, chronic  bronchitis, and emphysema will be especially at risk of being sickened by  coarse particulates if this bill were to  become law.  Additionally,  people  with  other  chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure, they will all be  placed at greater risk if this bill becomes law.  Mr. Chairman, as I’ve noted before,  this bill is a solution in search of a  problem, and it does more harm than  good. This bill should fail. I oppose this  bill.  ",2011
2251,13,2011-12-08,Mr. WHITFIELD.," Mr. Chairman,  I  might say that during the debate on  this bill in committee, a lot was made  of mining activities in rural America,  and I would just point out that there  are 17 Federal laws that mining operations must abide by. So we didn’t feel  like we needed to provide additional  protection in that area.  At this time I would like to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. HURT), one of the prime  sponsors of this legislation and a protector of rural America.  ",2011

2254,20,2011-12-08,Mr. HURT.," I thank the Chairman.  This amendment would allow  the  EPA to override the State and local  regulations and thereby gut the purpose of this bill.  Let’s remember what the commonsense purpose of this bill is. There’s  nothing radical at all about this bill. In  fact, in section 3 this bill protects public health. It protects public health by  relying on the State and local regulators who are best equipped to make  judgments about naturally occurring  dust. And it does nothing at all to affect the particulate matter 2.5 standard. I think that’s important to note  inasmuch as it seems that the opposition seems to want to forget that.  Let’s remember the ultimate purpose  of this bill, and that is to protect the  farmer and the rural businesses from  overreaching Federal regulation that  causes uncertainty and it causes job  loss.  However, the EPA and the opposition  talked about the myth. They say that  it’s more likely that the EPA would  regulate fairy dust. They say that this  is a solution in search of a problem.  But our farmers know better; our rural  business  owners know  better. They  know better because they have looked  at the proposed regulations and the  proposals from the EPA staff that was  dated back in April in which they proposed looking at and revising the PM10  standard. They also have seen the letter that was sent to my office in May  of this year in which Ms. McCarthy,  the assistant administrator, makes it  clear that agricultural dust and dust  coming off of roads is absolutely within  the  larger view of  these  standards.  That’s what our farmers know.  But most of all, they know their experience. They know what they have  endured over the years—over the decades—of what comes out of Washington  and how it affects their everyday life.  If you look at their track record, you  can only see why there is uncertainty  and why they believe this is a very,  very real threat.  I am proud to be able to travel across  my rural district in south side Virginia  and central Virginia and talk to farmers. In August, I sat down with a group  of  farmers  in Nelson and Albemarle  Counties. One of the farmers that was  there is a peach farmer, a fruit grower.  He said to me, Mr. HURT, on my farm,  where my family has been for generations growing peaches  for our  customers, I’m regulated by the Department of Labor, the Department of Agriculture, the FDA, the IRS, the Department of Transportation, the Corps  of Engineers, the EPA—and the  list  goes on when you add the State and  local regulators. He said, I’m regulated  by all those different agencies, most of  them Federal agencies; and all I’m trying to do is grow a peach. How hard can  it be?  And I think when you look at the  commonsense purpose of this bill, you  will see that this amendment would  gut it. It is for that reason that I would  urge my colleagues to vote against this  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands has 30 seconds remaining.  ",2011
2255,20,2011-12-08,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.,"  I would  just  like to add that my amendment does  not really take away any authority  from the State, local, and tribal governments; it just ensures that they set  standards that are based on the protection of the public health.  With that, I yield back the balance of  my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the  amendment  offered  by  the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Mrs.  CHRISTENSEN).  The question was  taken; and  the  Chair announced  that  the noes appeared to have it.  ",2011

2257,20,2011-12-08,Mr. CRAWFORD.," Mr. Chairman,  have an amendment at the desk.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate  the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  I  In section 132(b) of the Clean Air Act, as  proposed to be added by section 3 of the bill,  after ‘‘insofar as the Administrator’’ insert  ‘‘, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture,’’.  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 487, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. CRAWFORD) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Arkansas.  ",2011
2258,20,2011-12-08,Mr. CRAWFORD.," Mr. Chairman, my  amendment  is  very  straightforward,  and I believe it will help provide the  proper amount of interagency communication with the EPA when they go to  write air quality standards for particulate matter.  The  legislation  being  considered  today excludes nuisance dust from the  EPA regulatory net, but the bill provides an exemption if the EPA determines that the economic benefits of  regulating dust outweigh the cost. My  amendment would simply direct the  EPA to consult with the Department of  Agriculture in making this determination.  As a member of the Ag Committee,  I’ve heard testimony  from both the  Secretary of Agriculture and the EPA  Administrator on how their respective  agencies propose and write regulations.  A problem that became apparent to me  is that the two agencies don’t even  seem to communicate. Neither agency  could give me a sufficient explanation  of the protocol for interagency communication between  the EPA and  the  USDA. Their responses were bureaucratic and vague.  I find this troubling because if you  ask the farmers and ranchers in my Arkansas  district  about  the  greatest  threat to their operations, they always  respond with  three  letters: EPA.  I  don’t think their response would be the  same if both agencies worked together  more often.  b1240  Perhaps the best example of the right  hand not knowing what the left hand is  doing occurred this past summer when  the President was in his home State of  Illinois  for a  town hall event. One  farmer asked the President why the  EPA was targeting new regulations at  farmers after a difficult growing season  through the Midwest and Midsouth this  year. The President pointed to Ag Secretary Vilsack for backup and asked  the farmer to explain the specific regulations.  The farmer cited rules that would be  crippling to the ag community, including  regulating  farm dust. President  Obama defiantly dismissed the question by saying, ‘‘Don’t always believe  what you hear.’’ He  later  told  the  crowd: If you ever have a question as to  whether it’s going to make it harder  for you to farm, contact USDA.  It seems to me that the President  didn’t understand that it’s the EPA,  not  the Department of Agriculture,  that was the source of this man’s frustration. If the President doesn’t realize  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:32 Dec 09, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K08DE7.048 H08DEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2011

2261,34,2011-12-08,Mr. CANTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman.  I understand the point he is trying to  make.  ",2011
2262,34,2011-12-08,Mr. HOYER.," If I may, I thought I did  make the point.  ",2011
2263,34,2011-12-08,Mr. CANTOR.," Well, you may have  made the point.  Maybe, Mr. Speaker, what I’m trying  to say is that I disagree with the gentleman, that if the provisions dealing  with the Keystone pipeline are in the  measure that makes it to the floor that  we shouldn’t join together and do what  was done in the past, and that is demonstrate a strong bipartisan vote  in  support of that project. Because, as the  gentleman knows, organized labor in  this country is very supportive of that  bill, of that provision. It means immediate jobs. The President continues to  say he is for creating jobs, doing all we  can to get America back to work. This  is a provision that allows for that.  We also have seen, Mr. Speaker, in  response to the gentleman’s concerns  about Nebraska and the issues raised  by its Governor as well as its State legislature, I believe and am told that  there have been many discussions in  which an alternative route has been determined, and there is agreement on  that to allow for the proceeding of the  construction of the pipeline.  Again, knowing that there is strong  bipartisan  support  for  the  project,  knowing that labor is in support of it,  knowing that it puts people back to  work immediately, it would seem to  me that this is a consistent provision  to go along with making sure that we  deal with the unemployment situation  in this country through an extension of  the  UI  provisions—with,  hopefully,  some reforms—as well as the extension  of the payroll tax holiday.  As the gentleman knows, our side is  concerned. We don’t want taxes to go  up on anybody, especially in an economy like this. But again, I hope the  gentleman can consider joining us in  terms of helping promote an environment for job creation.  ",2011
2264,34,2011-12-08,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman  for his comment.  I will say this, though, it seems inconsistent, when the President of the  United States yesterday said he would  veto such a provision, that we would  include it in legislation that is must  pass.  By the way, the unemployment insurance, economists tell us, will provide for 100 times as many jobs; so,  therefore, we’re for that. Some 500,000  jobs may be affected by extending the  unemployment insurance.  In addition to that, I tell my friend,  the President has offered a jobs bill. I  know that you’re concerned about jobs.  The pipeline bill, in and of itself, is  about 5,000 to 6,000 jobs over the lifetime of the pipeline. The  jobs bill,  economists tell us, is 1 million jobs, or  200  times  as many  jobs. Notwithstanding that, very frankly, that has  been languishing since September and  not brought to this floor.  So it seems to me that, if we are really interested—and I think you are—in  extending  unemployment  insurance  and providing for a continued tax cut  for middle-income Americans and for  providing for the payment of doctors  who  are  serving Medicare  patients,  that we not include in that bill an item  that apparently is popular on your side  just because the President doesn’t like  it, according to ",2011
2265,34,2011-12-08,Mr. JORDAN.,"  b1500  I think that’s not the way we ought  to be operating. The last 7 days of the  session, or 5 days, 6 days, 7, assuming  we went through Sunday, we shouldn’t  be doing that, I suggest respectfully to  my friend, the majority leader, because  it will simply put us back into the situation the American public doesn’t want  us in, and that’s confronting one another, playing chicken with one another, bringing us to the precipice of  defeat and lack of success.  The public doesn’t want us there. We  shouldn’t want us there. And I would  urge  the gentleman not  to  include  items, as I have urged you with respect  to  the appropriation bills  that also  must be passed. That’s not in this list,  but you did mention it, of course, in  the announcement, Mr. ROGERS and  Mr. DICKShave been working hard, and  others have been working hard to get  our appropriations bills done.  We have urged that we not put controversial items in that, and we showed  our good faith on that representation  when we passed the minibus, and 165  Democrats  joined 135 Republicans to  pass that legislation.  So, again,  I would urge  the gentleman to, if he feels strongly about  that, and I know that he feels—he said  labor is for that bill. Labor is for that  bill. I think I’m for that bill, I want  the gentleman to know. So this does  not come from my particular opposition to this bill.  I am concerned about the alignment  and the aquifer. I think that’s a legitimate concern. But I think that that oil  is going to be drilled no matter what  we do. It seems to me that it’s better  for us to have it than for others to have  it and have that availability.  But having said that, gratuitously  putting it into a bill that the President  has already said I don’t agree with that  is simply playing chicken on legislation that’s very important.  If the gentleman wants to comment  on that, I would be glad to yield to  him.  ",2011
2266,34,2011-12-08,Mr. CANTOR.," I’d just say to the gentleman I’ve already responded to the  notion of  issues arising  in Nebraska  that I am told have been resolved, so  the issue that he is concerned about  has apparently been resolved.  I would say to the gentleman there  are 47 Members on his side of the aisle,  including  five  ranking members  of  committees, that have supported the  measure allowing for the construction  proceeding on the Keystone pipeline.  There’s no gratuitous move here. It’s  an attempt to try and bring the two  sides together on the most important  issue, which is creating jobs. This is a  provision that I believe has been demonstrated has support on both sides of  the aisle.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I would hope the  gentleman could refrain from trying to  say and  impute motives here. We’re  trying  to work  in a  fashion—open,  transparent, together so that we don’t  come to any kind of end that doesn’t  produce a result for the people. That’s  it.  Again, I appreciate the gentleman’s  sentiments.  ",2011
2267,34,2011-12-08,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman. I  was quoting, not imputing. Mr. JORDAN’s comments  seem  to be pretty  clear.  Before we conclude, the STOCK Act,  TIMWALZhad a bill that was ready for  markup in the committee. We understand that was pulled.  As you know, that bill has 220 cosponsors and is a bipartisan sponsorship.  It  simply  says  that Members  should not use insider information to  trade with,  information  the general  public may not have about legislation  that may or may not be reported or  passed to the floor. And I understand  that was pulled. I think that was unfortunate.  Can the gentleman tell me what the  status of that piece of legislation is?  ",2011
2268,34,2011-12-08,Mr. CANTOR.," Sure. Absolutely.  First of all, the issue of insider trading is something that we abhor as well,  do not tolerate, and believe that all  Members of Congress should fall under  the same laws that apply to anyone,  and want to make sure that is the case,  if it is not.  And transparency is the key because  the public needs to know what their  Members are doing. We intend to take  this  issue, make sure that concerns  that have been raised by Members on  both sides of the aisle are being vetted.  This is an issue of extreme import for  the confidence of the public towards  this institution. We intend to do so in  a deliberate manner.  There were  issues raised again by  Members on both sides of the aisle  about this bill not being brought up in  a vetted way. There are many other  chairmen who have jurisdiction in this  matter who need to be involved in this  with a full vetting, and we intend to do  that. And I do hope the gentleman will  work with us in doing so.  ",2011

2270,41,2011-12-08,Mr. SHIMKUS.," If my colleague would  continue to discuss this for a few minutes, you mentioned a  fund  in your  kind of opening statement. For the  benefit of the Speaker, could you explain where this fund comes from and  who is paying into it and what is it designed to do and what’s going on with  it right now.  ",2011
2271,41,2011-12-08,Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois.," Look, if  you pay for any kind of nuclear power,  ratepayers pay for this fund.  ",2011
2272,41,2011-12-08,Mr. SHIMKUS., So you have constituents who have been paying into this  fund?  ,2011
2273,41,2011-12-08,Mr. KINZINGER of  Illinois.," Sure.  And paying for a long time. Let me  add, for every year we delay opening—  Yucca Mountain is not going away; it  doesn’t disappear off the face of the  Earth—for every year we delay,  it’s  costing us half a billion dollars more  than what  it’s ultimately going  to  cost.  So my constituents, your constituents, anybody who uses any aspect of  nuclear power, which is almost everybody, has been paying for this. This  isn’t  some  giant  expenditure we’re  going to have to make out of the general  fund when we don’t have any  money. This is already being funded.  It’s already being paid  for.  It only  makes sense. I think the colleagues  that are joining me here today will say  the same thing: this just makes sense.  ",2011
2274,41,2011-12-08,Mr. SHIMKUS.," And part of this debate  about  the  nuclear waste  and  where it’s stored and the nuclear waste  fund has  been  litigated  in Federal  court, and the courts have said it is the  responsibility of the national government to take this waste as part of the  law, complying with  the  law. Obviously, we have no place to take it. So  we end up having the utility store the  high-level nuclear waste on site; and  some of them, some have not asked us  yet, some of them we are actually paying to hold the waste that we’re supposed to be holding.  ",2011
2275,41,2011-12-08,Mr. KINZINGER of  Illinois.,"  If my  colleague wouldn’t mind, and you mentioned it just a few minutes ago, this  idea passed this body with a large majority. That to me seems like this is  the will of the American people. It’s  not just some agenda or some crazy  pie-in-the-sky idea. This is the will of  the American people, and it’s the responsibility of us to ensure that we’re  being safe. I mean, it just seems very  basic to me, and so I’m having a hard  time figuring out how and why politics  has come into play on this. I think this  is a debate we solved decades ago. But  nonetheless, out in Washington, D.C.,  nothing surprises me in the 10 months  I’ve been out here.  ",2011
2276,41,2011-12-08,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," If the subcommittee chair  from Illinois would  yield to me, if the gentleman from the  11th of Illinois lets the gentleman from  the 11th of Georgia be somewhat instructive in regard to the politics, because that pure and simple is what it  is. Of course comments were made in  regard to the chairman of the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission.  But the fact is that it is the Secretary of Energy, it’s the Secretary of  Energy. This Secretary of Energy, a  Nobel Laureate in nuclear physics who  was essentially told by this administration to tell the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission  that he was  requesting  that the license application for Yucca  Mountain be withdrawn from the NRC,  taken out of their hands, the licensing  process stopped with prejudice.  Now, I’m not a lawyer, but if there  are any lawyers in the body, they understand when you withdraw  something with prejudice, that means you  can’t bring it back up. So this $14 billion that has been taken out of the  ratepayers from the 50 States, or at  least where these 103 reactors exist,  they are paying for this. And yet this  political pressure on a gentleman who’s  got to be much, much smarter than  any of us, a Nobel Laureate in nuclear  physics; if I were him, as soon as that  word came down to me and I got the  memo from the White House, I would  immediately resign over righteous indignation.  ",2011
2277,41,2011-12-08,Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois.," If I can  just say quickly on that point, Aby  Mohseni, acting director for licensing  and inspections at the NRC, made this  remark: ‘‘Some senior managers contributed to the manipulation of the  budget process and information to apparently make sure that the Yucca  Mountain project would be  left unfunded even if the license application  was still before the NRC. We were unprepared for the political pressures and  manipulations of our scientific and licensing  processes  that would  come  with  the  appointment  of Chairman  Jaczko in 2009.’’  ",2011

And it’s the majority  leader  in  the Senate  that  is  blocking the funding for the final scientific analysis, and it is the chairman  of the NRC who used to work for the  majority  leader who  is complicit  in  this plan to shut down an investment  of this country of $14.5 billion to comply with Federal law that we passed in  1982.  Now, in 1982 I was serving my country as an Army lieutenant in West Germany  before  the Wall  came  down.  That’s a long time ago. This has been  the policy of this country for decades.

2315,62,2011-12-08,Mr. RUBIO.," Earlier this week in Kansas, President Obama tried to score political points by chiding Senate Republicans for refusing to vote on the confirmation of Richard Cordray to be Director of the so-called Consumer Financial  Protection  Bureau—CFPB—  saying we refuse to let him do his job.  And the President asked, Why? I am  happy to answer his question, again.  Earlier this year, I joined 44 other  Senators  in  recommending  to  the  President three necessary reforms for  the CFPB in order to improve accountability in its operations. Specifically,  we asked that a board of directors be  established  to  oversee  it,  that  the  agency be subjected to the regular congressional appropriations process, and  for the establishment of a safety and  soundness check for the prudential regulators.  We made clear to the President that  without these reforms we would not  vote to confirm any nominee to run the  CFPB, regardless of political affiliation  or qualifications. The President chose  to  ignore our suggestions. Although  the President frequently pays lip service to accountability in the regulatory  process, when push came to shove, he  made this serious issue just another  talking point.  President Obama  is now trying to  pressure my colleagues to vote to confirm Mr. Cordray by traveling around  the country giving speeches. I want to  reiterate that I will not vote to confirm any director for this rogue bureaucracy until appropriate checks and  balances are put into place. President  Obama promised  that  ‘‘transparency  and accountability will be a hallmark  of my administration’’, making his refusal to make CFPB more transparent  especially disappointing.  Without  reform,  CFPB’s  director  would serve with unprecedented and  unconstitutional  amounts  of  power.  The director would have the power to  decide what rules are  issued  in the  name  of  consumer  protection,  how  funds are spent, and how its enforcement authority will be used. In short,  it empowers a single, unelected person  with seemingly endless and unchecked  authority. This bureaucracy holds the  sweeping ability to limit choices when  it comes to commonly-used financial  products such as home equity loans,  credit cards, and student loans. Simply  put, a designation from the CFPB director saying these products are ‘‘abusive’’ could restrict the availability of  credit to consumers and increase the  cost of goods or services for all Americans.  This year alone, over 70,000 pages of  new regulations have been added to the  books from agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the  National Labor Relations Board, oftentimes without  any  compelling  justification for their existence. The last  thing job creators in America need is  more uncertainty from a powerful government agency such as the CFPB that  will receive a blank check for a half  billion dollar budget with virtually no  input from Congress.  President  Obama  has  urged  the  American people to ‘‘help hold [him]  accountable’’. I stand with my Republican colleagues in an effort to do just  that. The  truth  is we need  transparency in government that provides  greater confidence that regulations are  designed to protect consumers from unfair practices, without destroying jobs.  Until basic transparency requests are  made, I will not support allowing the  CFPB to operate with unaccountable  leadership.  ",2011
2316,62,2011-12-08,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President,  both  sides agree that everyone benefits from  a marketplace free of fraud and other  deceptive and exploitative practices.  The disagreement is over the best way  to  structure our Federal  regulatory  agencies to accomplish this goal and  provide accountability.  One of the lessons of the financial  crisis  is that we need a supervisory  program that looks and considers how  safety and  soundness and  consumer  protection work together and reinforce  better and safer services to banking  customers. Far too often, supervision  either looked at consumer issues in isolation—promoting access to credit and  home ownership—or it looked at safety  and soundness in isolation, such as ensuring that customer information was  legally accurate but not asking whether it was understandable to bank customers.  We should have strengthened the link  and coordination between prudential  supervision and consumer protections  rather than severing it. Instead Congress institutionalized this separation  by creating a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and blurred the role  and accountability of the prudential  regulators and the new Bureau.  Mortgage underwriting is a good example of an issue that was found lacking before the financial crisis and has  the potential to be subject to an even  more bureaucratic regulatory system  going forward. I say potential because  it is unclear to me where the authority  of the Bureau stops and where the authority of  the prudential  regulators  overlaps on several  important  issues  that will likely cause confusion and potentially  inconsistent  regulatory approaches. Already we are seeing conflicts among regulators with different  regulators adopting different consumer  protection rules and duplication in examinations.  From my perspective, the new Bureau is a massive, expensive government bureaucracy that is immunized  against meaningful oversight by either  Congress or the President, and dramatically extends the Federal Government’s control over the economy.  According to analysis from Andrew  Pincus, a partner  in  the  law  firm  Mayer Brown LLP:  The Bureau’s structure has a number of  features  that, when  taken  together, concentrate an amount of unchecked authority  in a single individual—the Director—that is  unprecedented for a federal agency that regulates private entities and individuals:  First, the Bureau will be headed by a single Director with complete, unilateral authority to make all regulatory and enforcement decisions and to hire and fire all personnel, including his or her own deputy.  Second, the Bureau’s Director does not  serve at the pleasure of the President. Rather, during his or her five-year term, the Director may be removed only for inefficiency,  neglect of duty, or malfeasance  in office.  That  standard eliminates  the President’s  power to remove the Director based on a policy disagreement: once nominated and confirmed, the Director cannot be overruled by  the President.  Third, the Bureau is exempt from the congressional appropriations process. It is funded instead by a transfer of money from the  Federal Reserve in an amount determined  solely by the Director, subject only to a cap  that already exceeds $550 million, will increase 10% for the next fiscal year, and is  subject to automatic inflation adjustments  thereafter.  While I appreciate the willingness of  Richard Cordray to serve and answer  questions, I can’t support the consideration of any nominee to be the Director of the Bureau until the agency is  reformed to make it more accountable  and transparent.  First, we would establish a board of  directors to oversee the Bureau. This  would allow for the consideration of  multiple viewpoints in decisionmaking  and would reduce the potential for the  politicization of regulations. A board of  directors structure is consistent with  the organization of the Federal Reserve  VerDate Mar 15 2010  07:26 Jan 22, 2013 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\DECEMBER\S08DE1.REC S08DE1 h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

2318,69,2011-12-08,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I am saddened to have  learned this morning  that five people were killed late yesterday in the terrible helicopter crash just  a  few miles outside Las Vegas. My  sympathy is with the families of those  who died, including pilot Landon Nield  and four passengers. My thoughts are  with them as the recovery efforts continue this morning and as they  lay  their lost loved ones to rest.  Reports indicate the aircraft was on  a tour of Hoover Dam. It crashed into  a  remote and  rocky  terrain  in  the  River Mountains between Lake Mead  and Henderson, NV, a few miles from  Las Vegas.  I have taken those helicopter tours.  It is an exciting trip. People don’t realize this, but we are just a few miles  from the Grand Canyon there in Las  Vegas. It takes just a short time to  travel to that beautiful canyon to see  where millions of people go every year  to see the Grand Canyon. Hundreds of  thousands of tourists come from Las  Vegas to see it.  I am truly grateful for the efforts of  the National Park Service rangers, the  metropolitan police department,  the  search-and-rescue team, and the Henderson fire departments that responded  rapidly to the scene of the accident.  The Federal Aviation Administration  and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating this accident as we speak. I will continue to  monitor the investigation as well as  the  recovery  efforts  that  are  in  progress.  Hundreds of thousands of tourists, I  repeat, enjoy  these helicopter  tours  each year. I am sorry innocent people  lost their lives in such a rare tragedy.  Nevada puts great stock in protecting  the safety of its tourists, whether flyThe  ing over the Grand Canyon or walking  down the Las Vegas strip. I hope the  inquiry into the cause of this crash will  help us better protect helicopter pilots  and passengers in the future.  Again, my heart goes out to the families as they mourn this awful tragedy.  I note the absence of a quorum.  ",2011

2325,69,2011-12-08,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  come to the floor today to commend  Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta for  personally focusing top-level attention  to what has been a festering problem,  and I think it is fair for me to say a  festering problem  for decades.  I am  talking  about  the Defense Department’s broken accounting system and  lack of financial accountability.  Secretary Panetta has grabbed the  bull by the horns and told the military  services to get on the stick and move  out smartly. He wants them to fix the  problem now, not later. Secretary Panetta’s bold initiative is laid out in a  Department-wide memorandum dated  October 11 this year. In this document,  he calls for an all-hands-on-deck priority effort to accelerate plans to create a modern, fully integrated finance  and accounting system. Such a system,  if it ever comes to be, would be designed to generate reliable, accurate,  and  complete  financial  information.  Such a system should be capable of  producing  credible  financial  statements that can earn clean opinions  from independent auditors. If that happens,  the Department will  achieve  what is called full audit readiness. But  now I want to warn Secretary Panetta  about what has happened to so many  well-intentioned  Secretaries  of Defense. That could be a big ‘‘if.’’  Under the Chief Financial Officers  Act of 1990, all government agencies  were supposed to reach full audit readiness 15 years ago. As I understand it,  the Defense Department  is now the  only delinquent agency. After the passage of so much time, how is it, then,  that the Pentagon cannot provide an  accurate accounting of all the money it  spends? Doing it is a constitutional responsibility. Not doing it is unacceptable. Why are the military services  dragging their feet as they are? What is  the problem? Are all of  the petty  fiefdoms entrenched in Pentagon bureaucracy causing the problem? Is it  because they do not want to surrender  control of the money to a centralized  financial authority?  This is a festering problem Secretary  Panetta has tackled. As a former chairman of the House Budget Committee  and Director of the Office of Management and Budget, he has the necessary  knowledge and the necessary experience to get this job done.  The magic date  for achieving  full  audit readiness at Defense was set in  concrete 2 years ago. Unfortunately,  this goal has a long and elusive history, and that long and elusive history  is best characterized by relentless slippage. It is a rolling target date, and  most experts believe the 2017 deadline  is unattainable.  I  am  sure  our  tax-paying  public  doesn’t understand why  the Federal  Government wouldn’t have the best accounting system in the world, but they  don’t, particularly in the Defense Department.  Under Secretary Panetta’s  leadership, I hope all the slippage comes to a  screeching halt and all  the bureaucratic roadblocks are torn down. He  has definitely turned up the heat and  turned up the pressure. He has drawn a  line in the sand. He wants to see results and see results now. He is calling  for a revised plan for achieving audit  readiness. It is due on his desk December 13. So Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard,  and  everybody  else—well, the Coast Guard is not involved but everybody else—get on the  stick because that is next week. He has  set a near-term goal. He wants the Department to produce partial financial  statements by 2014.  As a first step, Secretary Panetta has  called for the production of statements  of budgetary resources by 2014. A statement of budgetary resources is just one  component of a  financial statement,  but  it  represents  a  big  important  chunk of the whole. If credible statements of budgetary resources can be  produced 3 years ahead of schedule,  then maybe the full audit readiness by  2017 is, indeed, possible.  I also understand that Secretary Panetta’s near-term goal is being incorporated in legislation working its way  through  Congress  right  now. That  should help to move the ball further  down the field.  Secretary Panetta’s decision to set a  preliminary goal of 2014 will be a good  gauge—a good test—of what is and is  not possible. Can the Defense Department achieve full audit readiness by  2017? We won’t have to wait 6 years to  find that out under the process Secretary Panetta is instituting. If problems surface early on, we in Congress  can help the Department take corrective action to keep this effort on track  and moving in the right direction.  A willingness and a commitment on  the part of the Secretary of Defense to  take on this problem goes way beyond  the production of credible  financial  statements required by the Chief Financial Officers Act of the late 1970s.

2329,76,2011-12-08,Mr. BEGICH.," Madam President, first,  I want to comment on the Cordray appointment that was attempted a little  bit ago, and then I want to bring up  some more good news on the economic  front.  First, I was somewhat disappointed  in the vote of 54 to 45, garnering only 1  Republican from the other side—only  1—and on such an important agency  that ensures  the protection of consumers in a variety of areas. It seems  illogical to me that we would not find  compromise in a vote to appoint someone to run an agency that this body, in  a 60-vote margin, approved to help protect  consumers, particularly  considering what has happened over the last  several years and the glaring problems  and challenges consumers have had to  endure with the financial institutions  of this country as well as from other  entrepreneurs, such as pawnshops and  payroll check cashers. All of these institutions would have firm regulations  and provide the consumer an opportunity to respond, or those who get  abused by those programs.  I am a little disappointed. I wasn’t  intending to come and speak on that  issue, but I wanted to have my voice on  the floor that I was disappointed that  an  appointment  could  not  happen,  which I believe is raw politics. It has  nothing  to do with  the  individual’s  ability to make this agency run properly. They didn’t want to appoint him  because they didn’t like the agency—  the 45 or so who didn’t vote for it. And  I think it all boils down to one very  simple thing: Consumers are now, once  again, left without someone running an  agency  that will help protect  them  against these people who prey on individuals in the financial arena.  THEECONOMY  Again, Madam President, I am somewhat disappointed, but let me get to  the real reason I came to the floor. I  came down yesterday and had a lot to  say about the economy and where we  are and the headlines that were reported yesterday. And in less than 48  hours—27 hours—there are more good  news headlines.  These are some of the headlines I  talked about yesterday: ‘‘Jobless Rate  Dips to Lowest Level in More Than 2  Years.’’ New York Times. CNN: ‘‘Dow  Closes With the Largest Gain Since  March  2009.’’  ‘‘Private Sector  Jobs  Soar. Payroll Forecasts Rise.’’ That is  Reuters. The Wall Street Journal: ‘‘Online Sales Reached Record $1.25 Billion  on Cyber Monday.’’  On top of that, we had record sales  for Thanksgiving weekend—Black Friday they call it, and Small Business  Saturday. Again, an incredible impact  for our economy.  What this tells me—even though we  get a lot of criticism from the other  side and others who complain maybe  we are not doing our job and are frustrated that Washington isn’t working  as well as it could—and I agree there  are a lot of areas where we are not able  to move forward, such as the appointment I mentioned a few minutes ago—  is there are good examples of policies  we have worked through over the last 3  years during this great recession. We  have fought kind of a lonely war to get  these policies in place.  Once again, more good news, and let  me read off a couple. This week’s Time  magazine has a whole article entitled  ‘‘How America Started Selling Cars  Again.’’ Why  is this  important? Because this is a manufacturing base for  our country.  It employs people not  only in jobs in the automobile industry  but it trickles all the way through the  economy of  the country.  It doesn’t  matter if they are at a port, for example.  I remember meeting recently with  the folks from the Detroit Port Authority talking about ships and the  movement of product from the automobile  industry across this country,  but also manufacturing and other activities throughout the country that  support the automobile industry. It is  moving forward. It is growing.  We took a dramatic step and got a  lot of criticism for it. As a matter of  fact, no one wants to even mention the  words, because everyone is so nervous  about it. Some call it an auto bailout.  And, yes, we did do that. That result is  a healthy, strong, profitable industry  that is bringing jobs to America and  creating jobs in America. As a matter  of fact, there was an article in the Wall  Street Journal not  long ago talking  about how we are importing jobs from  Japan and China back to the United  States, to the automobile industry, because it is successful.  And, oh, by the way, they are paying  back all those loans they got from the  Federal Government with interest. So  the taxpayers are getting their money  back in full. The net result is, because  we helped at the right time, we have  ensured we are still a player in the  automobile industry not only in this  country but in the world market. So  for those who want to continue to complain and to demonize that action, the  net result is we are bringing jobs back  to the United States in this industry.  The Cash for Clunkers Program was  another piece of legislation that barely  passed. Again, many of us on this side  of the aisle took that lonely road because we thought it was the right thing  to help move this economy  forward.  Again, the net result is this industry is  profiting more  in  the  last  several  years. They are producing more jobs  not only in their industry directly but  indirectly. And the naysayers on the  other side rarely bring this up anymore, because in less than 3 years—  really, less than 2 years—this industry  has  turned  itself around because of  American ingenuity and with the help  and support from the U.S. Government,  and that help and support is being paid  back with  interest  in  the good old  American way.  So from my perspective, once again,  this is a great story, and I commend  Time magazine for talking about the  future.

2338,90,2011-12-08,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Madam President,  I rise today to extend my personal  blessing this holiday season to the family of Jacob Akin of Somerset, Kentucky. This year, the town of Somerset  has graciously chosen  to honor  the  Akin family by accepting their donation of a 20-foot cherry spruce tree to  be displayed  in the town’s Fountain  Square as the county Christmas tree.  More important, however, is the solemn but heart-warming story of the  tree’s origin, and the  inspiration  it  brings to the people of the community.  The tree, known as ‘‘Jacob’s Tree,’’  was planted in remembrance of Jacob  Akin, who was tragically killed in a  terrible accident on December 6, 1994.  Five-year-old Jacob was playing with  his older brother, Abraham, in a house  when  a  chimney  unexpectedly  collapsed on top of him. Thus, the holiday  season each year is especially burdensome for his family, as it serves as a  constant reminder of the horrific accident that took place 17 years ago.  A year after his death, his family decided to plant a tree to honor young  Jacob. Over the years, the tree has  helped bring comfort and peace to the  family. ‘‘We decided to put up the tree  in memory of my son,’’ Jacob’s mother,  Rebecca Buis, says. ‘‘I felt like as the  tree grew, I could keep up with the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  07:26 Jan 22, 2013 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\DECEMBER\S08DE1.REC S08DE1 h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011
2339,104,2011-12-08,Mr. GERLACH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate The Brandywine Health Foundation of Coatesville, Chester County, Pennsylvania, on the occasion of its 10th anniversary.  Over  the  last  ten years,  the Brandywine  Health Foundation has made over $10 million  in grants and scholarships to improve health  and  encourage  youth  development  in  the  greater Coatesville area.  Its efforts have resulted in bringing ChesPenn Health Services,  the only Federally Qualified Health Center in  Chester County, to Coatesville. This helps to  provide over 8,000 patient visits to low income  County residents. Additionally, the Foundation  has assisted  in  the development of a new  Dental Center, Chester County Community  Dental, and has partnered with  the Chester  County Department  of Mental Health  and  Mental Retardation, as well as the Coatesville  Area School District, to bring behavioral health  services to child guidance research centers.  The Brandywine Health Foundation is also  responsible  for  the construction of  the  four-  story Brandywine Center, which opened  in  April 2008 and houses the non-profit organizations  such as ChesPenn Health Services,  Chester County Community Dental, Child  Guidance Resource Centers,  and Human  Services, Inc., as well as offering 24 units of  affordable senior housing.  Mr. Speaker, in light of its years of exemplary  service  to  the  community  and  outstanding accomplishments, I ask that my colleagues  join me  today  in  recognizing The  Brandywine Health Foundation in celebration  of its 10 year anniversary.  ample of progress you see in Dunkirk today—  from waterfront development  to  the Dunkirk  Boardwalk Market,  from  the SUNY Fredonia  Incubator to the redevelopment of the vacant  Crocker-Sprague  building—you  see  Dick  Frey’s fingerprints. Through Dick’s efforts, underutilized  recreational  parks  and  other  brownfields  throughout  the city were  turned  into clean and development-ready sites.  Never shy about fighting for his city, I first  met Dick Frey in 2005, shortly after I took office  representing Dunkirk  and Chautauqua  County as a Member of Congress, and  I’ll  confess to being a little concerned. After all,  Dunkirk and Chautauqua had not been represented in Congress by a Democrat in nearly  a generation. But after our first meeting, two  things were clear: number one, Dick Frey was  a man of his word who passionately cares  about the constituents he served; number two,  Dick Frey cares about people, and not politics.  Dick once said in an interview with the Dunkirk Observer newspaper, ‘‘As far as politics  go, you can expect  to  leave politics at  the  door when dealing with [people’s] concerns.’’  That statement embodies my experience with  him completely. Though we come  from different political sides of the aisle, politics was  never an  issue between us. We both  represented the same people—the hard-working  folks in the city of Dunkirk—and we each had  a responsibility to deliver for them.  Now as his wife Pat and  their  large extended family will welcome Dick back to them  after loaning him, his time and attention to the  city and its residents for the past ten years,  we wish them good luck as Dick leaves active  civic life for a much deserved respite.  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me a  few moments to commemorate the service of  one of the most honorable public servants that  I have had  the good  fortune  to know.  I am  thankful all  the more, however,  to call Dick  Frey my friend, and to wish him Godspeed in  all of his future endeavors.  f  f  HONORING THE CAREER OF  MAYOR RICHARD FREY  RECOGNIZING CITY OF SAN LUIS  OBISPO POLICE CHIEF DEBORAH  E.

With a long career in the private sector—  and distinguished wartime service in Korea, including earning the Purple Heart—before running for Mayor, Dick Frey has unquestionably  been a hands-on Mayor for the residents of  Dunkirk.

Chief Linden is a native Californian, raised  in Sunnyvale. She moved to Santa Barbara in  1979 to attend U.C. Santa Barbara, graduating  in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology. She began her law enforcement career  with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department as a Deputy Sheriff at the age of 22.  During her 18 year tenure at the Sheriff’s  Department, Chief Linden served in a variety  of assignments including Patrol Deputy, Narcotics Detective, Major Crimes Detective, Patrol Sergeant, Major Crimes Sergeant, Lieutenant, and Commander.  She was hired by  the City of San Luis  Obispo as Chief of Police on January 1, 2003.  Chief Linden holds a Master of Arts degree  in Leadership  from St. Mary’s College  in  Moraga and she is a P.O.S.T. Command College graduate. In 2004, she was honored with  a three-year gubernatorial appointment to the  California  Commission  on  Peace  Officer  Standards and Training and  she was  reappointed  to subsequent  terms  in 2007 and  2010. Chief Linden serves on the Board of the  California Police Chiefs Association and is a  lifetime member of the California Narcotic Officers Association. Chief Linden  is also dedicated to future members of law enforcement,  as she has been a criminal justice instructor  for Santa Barbara City College, an academy  instructor for Allan Hancock Law Enforcement  Academy, and an  instructor of Public Policy  for St. Mary’s College Graduate Leadership  Program.  Chief Linden also takes an active role in our  local community  in addition  to her commitments as Police Chief. She  is  involved with  many community and non-profit groups,  including serving on the boards of the Anti-Defamation League, Transitions Mental Health Association, and the Monday Rotary Club in San  Luis Obispo. She is the law enforcement representative on  the San Luis Obispo County  Homeless Services Oversight Council.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join  me in honoring Deborah Linden, for her leadership, dedication, and outstanding service to  our community and the San Luis Obispo Police Department.  f  IN HONOR OF SCOTT KENNEDY  HON.

His energy,  intelligence, and  dedication served the City of Santa Cruz since  1976, when he co-founded the Resource Center for Nonviolence. In 1991, Scott began his  political career, serving on the Santa Cruz City  Council  from 1991  to 1998 and again  from  2001–2003. He also served as the mayor of  Santa Cruz in 1994 and 2004. Throughout his  life, Scott demonstrated a strong commitment  to  his  community  and  he will  be  dearly  missed. I am proud to honor my friend and his  service to the City of Santa Cruz and to the  rest of the world.  Scott was born in Nebraska on December 9,  1948, and grew up in San Jose, California. He  began his advocacy  for  international peace  while attending the University of California at  Santa Cruz when as a freshman he first traveled  to  the  Israel-Palestine  region.

I am speaking  of  former Montgomery Mayor  Emory  Folmar, who passed away on November 11 at  the age of 81.  Emory Folmar was born in Troy, AL, in 1930  and moved to Montgomery when he was fourteen. After graduating from Sidney Lanier High  School in 1948, he attended The University of  Alabama, receiving a BS in Business in just  three years while serving as cadet colonel of  the Army ROTC.  After college, he received an Army commission and went  to Ft. Benning, GA  for parachute training and instructors’ schools where  he was assigned to the 11th Airborne Division  attached to the 2nd Infantry Division. He married Anita Pierce in February 1952 and was  deployed to Korea that summer. Wounded in  action, he received the Silver Star, the Bronze  Star and the Purple Heart. At the rank of lieutenant,  he  received  the French Croix  de  Guerre as a result of his actions with the 23rd  Regiment of  the 2nd  Infantry Division and  French troops.  Following his service in Korea, he was assigned to Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, as an Airborne Jump Master until 1954. He then moved  to Montgomery  to  join his brother  James  Folmar and Henry Flynn in home construction.  The Folmar brothers’ business later expanded  to  include  large commercial shopping center  construction throughout the Southeast.  In 1975, he entered politics at the urging of  his son David,  first running  for Montgomery  city council. He was soon elected president of  the city council and  then became Mayor of  Montgomery from 1977 till 1999. His time in  office was marked by economic growth and an  emphasis on law and order.  Mayor Folmar ran as Republican  for governor in 1982 against former Democrat Governor George C. Wallace. Although he did not  win  the election, Emory made  the strongest  showing of any Republican running  for governor since reconstruction to that time.  Very active  in Republican politics on  the  state and national levels, he also served as  campaign chairman  for Ronald Reagan’s  finance committee in 1980; state chairman for  President Reagan in 1984; and chairman for  Thursday, December 8, 2011  ",2011
2344,111,2011-12-08,Mr. POLIS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call  attention  to a change  in  the Capitol Visitors  Center. Two paintings by the prominent 19th  century painter Albert Bierstadt have recently  been returned to the Capitol Complex by the  Architect of the Capitol. Originally purchased  after the Civil War, ‘‘Discovery of the Hudson  River’’ and ‘‘Entrance into Monterey,’’ are part  of  the  first  indigenous American school of  painting, called the Hudson River School. This  movement was not just restricted to beautiful  landscapes—it also had an important influence  on American  culture,  recreation, and  conservation.  Though the Hudson River School originated  in upstate New York, painters soon began  traveling widely  to study and capture new  scenes. These travels took the painters to Europe,  the Middle East, North Africa, South  America, and the American West. Bierstadt is  one of the most prominent artists of the Western United States, and has a strong connection to my district in Colorado.  In 1859, Bierstadt  traveled  to my home  State of Colorado and to Wyoming, then territories, with a government surveyor. The large-  scale  landscapes he painted  from his notes  and sketches from this trip prompted the creation of many more paintings back in his studio. Bierstadt’s depiction of the craggy peaks  of the Rockies, the Sierra Nevada, and in Yosemite, among others, resulted  in  the christening of Mount Bierstadt in my district.  In the 1870s, Congress purchased several  of Bierstadt’s works,  including  the  two  that  hang  today  in  the CVC. These same paintings, and other Western landscapes by Hudson River School painters, coupled with a  growing  environmental  conservation movement, inspired Congress to protect this natural  beauty  through  the creation of Yellowstone  and Yosemite National Parks. Later,  these  paintings were used again to prompt the formation of the National Park Service.  This  is  just one example of  the Hudson  River School of Painters’ legacy. The School  emphasized  realistic, highly detailed scenes  that were very popular over the 19th century.  These works captured the beauty and variety  of the American landscape.  Painters from the Hudson River School also  had a hand in the foundation of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Inspired  by the artistic culture of the capitals of Europe,  School painters  joined other area businessmen and academics to form the Met in 1870.  Bierstadt met with  the President, and other  painters of the School served as trustees or  as members  of  the  executive  committee.  Today, many of Bierstadt’s works hang in the  Met alongside works by many other Hudson  River School painters, as well as other institutions like the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage Americans of all  ages to take the time to view these paintings  and consider  the beauty and greatness of  these landscapes, both on canvas and in the  wilderness.  f  THE FAILURE TO PROTECT FARMERS AND RANCHERS FROM CORPORATE ABUSES  HON. MARCY KAPTUR  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, December 8, 2011  ",2011
2345,111,2011-12-08,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  express my disappointment with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s  (USDA) Grain  Inspection, Packers & Stockyards Administration’s (GIPSA) final rule that was supposed to  protect our Nation’s  farmers and  ranchers  from abusive practices in the livestock industry.  Simply put, the final rule is inadequate and  shows the power big corporate packers and  processors have in this country. The final rule  does not include about half of the protections  it did in a previous draft.  Congress had to direct USDA in the 2008  farm bill to establish a set of comprehensive  protection rules because the department was  so slow in responding to the changing marketplace that has become so slanted toward corporate packers and processors  that we are  losing small farmers at a rapid pace.  The  average  American  chicken  grower  makes 34 cents per bird while the processing  corporation makes $3.23 per bird. With a profit  margin of 34 cents is it any wonder that we  have  lost  over  460,000  small-scale  farms  since 1982.  USDA claims it is committed to ensuring a  fair and transparent marketplace. How can we  have a fair and transparent marketplace when  we allow corporations to force farmers to sign  production contracts where one farmer is paid  less than another despite producing the same  livestock because there is no way for farmers  to determine fair product value since there is  no contract disclosure requirement.  In addition, how can USDA claim it supports  a fair marketplace when it fails to clearly define conduct that is a violation of law? How  are farmers supposed to know when they are  being  taken advantage of when  the governmental agency  tasked with protecting  them  does not tell them what types of practices are  a violation of the law?  This House has not helped our Nation’s producers either. We recently passed legislation  that withholds funding from USDA to move forward with establishing more comprehensive  fairness rules.

2347,2,2011-12-15,Mr. NEAL.," Madam Speaker, I want  to talk about a program that is set to  expire at the end of the year if Congress does not act, and it’s the New  Markets Tax Credit program. I have  fought for this program since its enactment in 2000 because it’s a cost-effective way to create jobs and drive investment  in communities with high  rates of poverty and unemployment.  I’ve seen the amazing results of this  initiative first hand back home in Massachusetts, and today I want to highlight  one  of  those Massachusetts  projects, the Colonial Theater in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  Let me tell you a little about the  New Markets Tax Credit. The program  was designed to stimulate investment  and economic growth  in  low-income  communities  that  are  traditionally  overlooked  by  conventional  capital  markets. The New Markets Tax Credit  program attracts capital to low-income  communities by providing private investors with a 39 percent Federal tax  credit for investments made in businesses  or  economic  development  projects located in certain areas where  the individual poverty rate is at least  20 percent or where median family income is low.  According  to  the Government Accountability Office, 88 percent of the  New Markets Tax Credit investors said  they would not have made the investment  in  a  low-income  community  without New Markets Tax Credits.  Every project or business financed by  New Markets Tax Credits is located in  a low-income community and/or benefits low-income individuals. The vast  majority, over 90 percent of investment  dollars generated through New Markets, has gone to communities with  levels of economic distress that far exceed the minimum requirements of the  law; and 60 percent has gone to communities with very high unemployment  rates that are at least 1.5 times the national average.  Through 2009, New Markets cost the  Federal Government, in terms of lost  revenue, less than $4 billion. That $4  billion should be treated as a government  investment because  it has resulted in $50 billion in capital projects  in those low-income communities and  created or retained an estimated 500,000  jobs. According to the Treasury Department, every $1 of foregone tax revenue under New Markets leverages $12  of  private  investment  in  distressed  communities. That’s  results,  in my  opinion.  Unfortunately, New Markets  is  a  temporary program and unless Congress acts this month, it will expire on  December 31. I am, and have been, the  lead Democratic sponsor of legislation  to extend this program for 5 years; and  I have been  leading  the charge  for  years to make this a permanent initiative. I once again call on our colleagues  to extend New Markets.  Let’s talk about the success of New  Markets  in Massachusetts. Over  170  businesses in Massachusetts have received New Markets  financing: Hot  Mama’s Foods in Springfield; the River  Valley Market  in Northampton;  the  Holyoke Health Center; and now the  High Performance Computing Center in  Holyoke as well.  But I want to focus today on the Colonial Theater in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Pittsfield is a city in western  Massachusetts with a population of  about  42,000 people.  It’s  the  largest  community in that region of the State.  It has struggled with unemployment  and urban blight. The Colonial Theater  is a rare architectural gem and one of  the greatest acoustical houses in the  world, located in the heart of Pittsfield. It was built at the turn of the  century, and it was closed for more  than 50 years. Periodic attempts to redevelop the theater failed for lack of  money and sustained public support.  However, thanks to New Markets Tax  Credit, financing of $16.7 million of a  total project cost of $21 million, this  70,000 square foot theater and adjacent  building were magnificently restored.  With 823 seats, the theater reopened in  2006 and now  features an  impressive  lineup of plays and musical  shows.  James Taylor is currently performing  at the Colonial Theater as part of the  cast of ‘‘A Christmas Carol.’’ Since its  renovation, the theater has hosted Arlo  Guthrie, the Four Tops, and Bob Weir  of the Grateful Dead will perform this  spring. Recent musicals and plays at  the Colonial Theater  include  ‘‘The  Who’s  Tommy,’’  ‘‘The  Producers,’’  ‘‘The Wizard of Oz,’’ and ‘‘Rent.’’  After the first 2 years of operation,  the independent research firm Center  for Creative Community Development  estimated that the Colonial Theater  sustains a direct economic impact of $4  million annually and 100 full-time jobs  in the Berkshire area.  The Colonial Theater is a symbol of  the re-emergence of Pittsfield as an  economic and cultural center of the  Berkshires. Anchoring the city’s comprehensive strategy for downtown revitalization, the restored and vibrant Colonial Theater—along with six-screen  Beacon Cinema Complex, also financed  with New Markets Tax Credits—has  created jobs, attracted new businesses,  spurred residential development, and  added vitality to this city. Widespread  street-level  vacancies  in  downtown  Pittsfield has  been  virtually  eliminated and 45 new businesses and restaurants have opened. The restoration  has helped attract an estimated 400,000  new visitors to the downtown Pittsfield  area each year.  Let’s rejuvenate the New Markets  Tax Credit program.  f  WELCOME HOME, COMPANY C  ",2011

2351,9,2011-12-15,Mr. SCHIFF.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to honor the memory of Staff  Sergeant  Vincent  J.  Bell,  United  States Marine Corps. He was 28 years  old, the son of Pamela Alexander-Bell  and James Bell, the husband of Karen  Navarrete, and the brother of London  Bell and Andrea Roe.  Staff Sergeant Bell enlisted in the  Marine Corps on July 7, 2001, and became an artilleryman. During his career, Staff Sergeant Bell served his  country with distinction and deployed  in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom  with Battalion Landing Team 2/1; 2nd  Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment; Battalion Landing Team 2/4; and 5th Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment.  On October 31, 2011, Staff Sergeant  Bell deployed with the 2nd Battalion,  11th Marine Regiment, where he served  as a Howitzer section chief for a 10-man  team in support of Operation Enduring  Freedom. On November 30, Staff Sergeant Bell was  in Kajaki, Helmand  province, Afghanistan, when he stepped  on  an  improvised  explosive  devices  while on a dismounted patrol. He succumbed to his wounds, making the ultimate sacrifice for his country.  Staff Sergeant Bell loved being a marine. He said that ‘‘the ability to serve  is the greatest calling an American  could do, even more so to be a United  States marine.’’ Staff Sergeant Bell  was well respected by his seniors and  subordinates alike. His company commander, Captain Joshua Kling, said he  ‘‘can’t  remember  one  conversation  with Staff Sergeant Bell where he  wasn’t  smiling and  telling me how  great it was. To suffer hardness and adversity with good cheer is the quality  of a fine man. He was a rocket man, a  cannoneer, a platoon sergeant, an entrusted marine who always got the job  done.’’  His platoon commander, First Lieutenant David Waters, said that all marines who served with Staff Sergeant  Bell ‘‘understood his sacrifice and will  miss him as a brother and friend. He  faced the fear and danger of this profession with a true heart. He had the  heart of a warrior and spirit of a true  patriot. I know he will be in heaven  guarding the way.’’  Staff Sergeant Bell loved his marines  and being a mentor  to  them. Previously, he served as an instructor with  the 11th Marine Regiment’s Artillery  Training School where he provided advanced training to the section chiefs  for the regiment.  Upon returning to the 2nd Battalion,  11th Marines, Staff Sergeant Bell was  excited that he was with a unit getting  ready  for deployment. Captain Kling  noted that he was ‘‘chomping at the bit  to be challenged—for an opportunity to  train,  teach, and mentor marines.’’  Sergeant  Erick Granados  described  Staff Sergeant Bell as ‘‘an outstanding  marine, a great leader, and most of all,  a good man. Firm but fair, guidance  was always there when we needed it,  but he let us do our job. He empowered  his marines to take responsibility and  lead others.’’  Staff Sergeant Bell was devoted to  his family, fellow marines, and friends.  His brother said that ‘‘Vincent was an  outstanding marine and a good man.  He  had  courage,  commitment,  and  strong values. He believed in following  orders, loved our country, and served  our country with pride. He believed in  doing the right thing for the right reason. Vincent had an amazing sense of  humor, even in tough times. He had a  very caring and nurturing personality  and was a mentor to young people  since he was a young man.’’  Staff Sergeant Bell told his mother  that it was a privilege to serve under  both President George Bush and President Barack Obama. In 2009, Vincent  called his mother from Iraq and told  her that he had reenlisted because he  wanted to have the privilege to serve  under the first African American President of the United States.  Staff Sergeant Bell’s wife Karen said  that ‘‘Vincent was a kind, giving man.  I’ll miss my husband every day of my  life, but his spirit will remain alive  with me, his family, and his marines.’’  Karen’s brother and sisters considered  Vincent to be their big brother. Her  parents shared a mutual respect  for  Vincent. They knew how much he  loved and cared for her. In addition to  his family and friends, Staff Sergeant  Bell was also devoted to the family’s  wonderful dogs Nala and Nemo.  Staff Sergeant Bell’s personal decorations include the Purple Heart, posthumously; the Navy and Marine Corps  Achievement Medal with one gold star;  the Good Conduct Medal with  two  bronze stars; and the Combat Action  Ribbon with one gold star.  Since Staff Sergeant Bell’s death was  announced, his unit has received condolences from marines across the globe  who served with him. This reflects his  professionalism,  leadership,  and  the  lives he touched as a United States Marine. Our Nation has lost a good man—  a son, brother, husband, and a marine—  who gave his life in defense of freedom.  He will be missed, and his sacrifice will  not be forgotten.  f  LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND  ",2011

It is my honor now to continue to  bring the voices of my constituents to  this floor. And the following is from  Howard Tenenbaum. He  is a science  teacher in La Jolla, and I believe his  class is watching today. He sent me his  opinion on education:  ‘‘Weighing a pig every day doesn’t  get you a fatter pig. And annual testing of all students in all subject areas,  without it impacting their grade, has  not resulted in smarter students. It has  made our students lose their intrinsic  desire to learn and added an expensive  layer of bureaucracy to an already administratively top-heavy system.  ‘‘This is especially true for science  education. It is clear that the current  accountability system has failed. Our  students, parents, and their teachers  are being held hostage to this failed  system. When was the last time you  were forced to take an exam, asked to  do your ‘best,’ and knew that the result  wouldn’t affect how you were being  evaluated?’’  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Howard  for bringing to the House his thoughts  on education and this question to our  floor.  f  COMMUNICATION FROM THE  CLERK OF THE HOUSE  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following communication from the Clerk of the House of  Representatives:  OFFICEOFTHECLERK,  HOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, DC, December 15, 2011.

2368,30,2011-12-15,Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia.," Thank  you, And I appreciate that. I’m not  sure about phenom, but I’m very appreciative to be on the Energy and Commerce Committee.  We have a lot of issues in my district.  For those of you who are watching this  who aren’t familiar with my district, I  represent southwest Virginia. It is a  big  energy-producing  region  of  the  State of Virginia.  And in Virginia, we understand that  we should use our own resources to create jobs. So I come here today for jobs  to be created in the United States—not  in Virginia directly, but  in another  part of this great Nation, because the  issues are often the same. And for some  reason, this administration is standing  in the way of the creation of jobs in the  energy industry.  In Virginia, we have asked repeatedly  to be able to drill off our coast in order  to find oil and natural gas. We want to  use our resources to create jobs. We  started asking for this in Virginia back  in 2004. At that time we had Democrat  Governors, and they blocked our efforts to send this to the Federal Government. Later, having a change of  heart, one of the Governors decided, as  they were on their way out the door,  that they would send the request forward. But to this date the President  has not realized that we can create  jobs. But our jobs, unlike the jobs in  Nebraska and other parts of the United  States  affected  by Keystone,  they  would be several years down the road.  b1530  What we have here is the Nation’s  best shovel-ready project. In reality,  it’s ready to go. And while  it’s not  American oil, it’s Canadian oil. And  one would have to believe that the Canadians don’t care about their environment to be opposed to this pipeline.  One would have to believe that the  President of the United States would  prefer to see the oil from Canada going  to China. One would have to believe  that the President of the United States  would prefer for us to buy oil from  other nations, like Venezuela and some  of the Arab nations that don’t care for  us one iota, than to do this pipeline.  One would have to believe that, for  some reason, we want to be dependent,  and this President wants us to be dependent on other nations who don’t  care for us, who don’t appreciate our  democratic, republican form of government, and who don’t understand that  jobs and the economy are a driving  concern, something that we must pay  attention to and that we must do it  now.  And here we have thousands of jobs,  thousands of  jobs. We’ve heard  the  number 20,000. Those are direct jobs.  You can multiply that number out beyond and beyond. And they’re being  stopped.  And if are you an energy producer  and you see something that makes as  much sense as the Keystone pipeline  being stopped dead in its tracks because the President doesn’t want to  make a decision until next year, and  maybe the next year after that, you  have to believe that it’s not worth investing here in the United States for  energy concerns.  I had a fellow came up to me recently  back home. He said, MORGAN, I want to  tell you something. He showed me the  article he’d found. He said, I’ve always  invested  in American energy. That’s  where I’ve always put my money. He  said, But right now the situation is so  uncertain—and  this was  before we  knew the President was going to delay  this very reasonable project, the Keystone pipeline. He said, I’m now investing in southern Africa with a consortium that has, I believe it was Australians, South Africans, and Brazilians working on a project in Mozambique. He said, I didn’t want to do it,  but I don’t know what choice I have  when you look at what is coming out of  the administration, when they don’t  want us to invest in American energy.  So, ladies and gentlemen, I have to  tell you, I came here today—this does  not directly affect my district, but it  does affect my country, and  I care  deeply about my country.  Our country needs jobs. We need affordable  energy.  Keystone  pipeline  helps us both have jobs and affordable  energy. And that is why it’s important  for every person in the United States  to understand that we must have the  Keystone pipeline; and the sooner we  start, the sooner those jobs occur, and  the  sooner we get more oil  supply  that’s not from our adversaries in the  world, the people who would like to see  the United States torn down, but from  our  friend Canada, who understands  that together we can build a more prosperous North America.  Ladies and gentlemen, with that, I  would  like  to  thank  the gentleman  from Nebraska for yielding.  ",2011

What we have is a $7 billion infrastructure project for the United States  of America that will immediately employ 20,000 workers. It’s a 2-year-plus  project. It will add—then, that’s not  even counting the spin-off jobs to support and to expand the refineries, the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  12:46 Dec 16, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K15DE7.062 H15DEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011

I wish to tell all the Members of the  Senate that we will probably have a series of votes around  4 o’clock  this  afternoon.  f  CONCLUSION OF MORNING  BUSINESS  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Morning business is closed.  f  EXECUTIVE SESSION  NOMINATION OF MORGAN CHRISTEN TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT  JUDGE  FOR  THE  NINTH  CIRCUIT  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the  Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk will report.  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Morgan Christen, of Alaska,  to be United States Circuit Judge for  the Ninth Circuit.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.  ",2011
2449,471,2011-12-15,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I see both  Senators from Alaska on the Senate  floor, and I beg their indulgence. I will  continue for about 5 minutes, first on  the  nomination  of  Justice Morgan  Christen of Alaska to fill one of the  four vacancies on the Court of Appeals  for the Ninth Circuit, a judicial emergency vacancy.  This  nominee  is  eminently well  qualified and should be confirmed. Senand Senator BEGICH  have worked very hard  to get  this  ator MURKOWSKI nominee through, and I thank both of  them. Today, we will take a step toward addressing a serious vacancy crisis in the busiest Federal appeals court  in the country. I would hope, before we  adjourn, that we could get the other 16  judges who have come out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously—every  Democrat and every Republican voting  for them—that are on the calendar. I  would hope before we adjourn we could  get those done.  Mr. President, I thank the majority  leader for scheduling today’s vote. It  should not have taken more than 3  months to obtain Republican consent  to consider the nomination of Justice  Christen after it was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on  September 8. Her nomination has the  strong support of both of Alaska’s Senators, Republican Senator LISAMURKOWSKIand Democratic Senator MARK  BEGICH, who introduced Justice Christen to the Judiciary Committee at her  hearing on July 13. Several Republican  leaders from Alaska also wrote to the  Judiciary Committee to express their  support, including former Alaska State  Senator Arliss Sturgulewski, and Walt  Monegan, the former Alaska commissioner for public safety appointed by  then-Governor  Sarah  Palin.  Connecticut  State  Representative  Lile  Gibbons, a Republican, has also written  to the committee to express her support.  Justice Christen is the kind of qualified, consensus nominee who in past  years would have been considered and  confirmed by the Senate within days of  being reported unanimously by the Judiciary  Committee,  not  stuck  for  months unnecessarily on the Senate  calendar. She is an experienced jurist  who has served on Alaska’s highest  court for the past 3 years. She was  nominated to that position by then-  Governor Sarah Palin, and she is the  second woman in Alaska’s history to  serve on  its supreme court. Justice  Christen previously served for 7 years  as a judge on the Superior Court for  Alaska’s Third Judicial District, 3 of  those years as the presiding judge. She  worked in private practice for 13 years  in Anchorage, clerked for Judge Brian  Shortell of the Alaska Superior Court,  and has demonstrated a deep commitment to her community throughout  her career. Once she is confirmed, Justice Christen will be the first woman  from Alaska to serve on the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The unexplained Republican delay in  consenting to consider her nomination  has caused unnecessary delays in filling  judicial emergency vacancies on  the Ninth Circuit, the busiest Federal  circuit court in the country. Sixty-one  million Americans live in the jurisdiction served by the Ninth Circuit. At a  time when judges on that circuit are  being called upon to handle double the  caseload of the other Federal circuit  courts, the Senate should have expedited  the  consideration  of  Justice  Christen’s nomination, not needlessly  slowed it down. The chief judge of the  Ninth Circuit, Judge Alex Kozinski, a  Reagan  appointee,  along with  the  members of the Judicial Council of the  Ninth Circuit, have written to the Senate emphasizing  the Ninth Circuit’s  ‘‘desperate need for judges,’’ urging the  Senate to  ‘‘act on judicial nominees  without delay,’’ and concluding that  they ‘‘fear that the public will suffer  unless our vacancies are  filled very  promptly.’’  The judicial emergency vacancies on  the Ninth Circuit are harming litigants  by  creating unnecessary and  costly  delays. The Administrative Office of  U.S. Courts reports that it takes nearly  5 months longer for the Ninth Circuit  to issue an opinion after an appeal is  filed, compared to all other circuits.  The Ninth Circuit’s backlog of pending  cases far exceeds other Federal courts.  As of March 2011, the Ninth Circuit had  13,913 cases pending before it. The second  closest—the  Sixth  Circuit—had  5,231 cases pending.  If caseloads were really a concern of  Republican  Senators,  as  they  contended when they filibustered the nomination last week of Caitlin Halligan to  the DC Circuit, they would not have  delayed Justice Christen’s nomination  to fill a judicial emergency vacancy for  over 3 months. If caseloads were really  a concern, Senate Republicans would  consent to move  forward to confirm  Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of California,  another well-qualified nominee, to fill  a judicial emergency vacancy on the  Ninth Circuit. Her nomination was also  reported unanimously by the Judiciary  Committee and needs only a final up-  or-down vote by  the Senate. Judge  Nguyen is nominated to fill the judicial emergency vacancy that remains  after the Republican filibuster of Goodwin Liu. I hope the Senate will be allowed to take up and confirm her nomination to finally fill that vacancy before the Senate concludes its work for  the year.  I also hope we can continue to make  progress early in the New Year by considering two nominations to the Ninth  Circuit now pending before the Judiciary Committee. Earlier this week we  held a hearing with Paul Watford of  California, nominated to fill yet another judicial emergency vacancy on  the Ninth Circuit. I would have  included another nominee to the Ninth  Circuit at that hearing, Justice Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona, who has the  support of Senator KYL, but committee  Republicans were not ready to proceed  on that nomination. I hope both can be  considered and confirmed early next  year.  The Senate should act to address the  continuing crisis in judicial vacancies  that affects not only the Ninth Circuit  but Federal courts around the country.  It is now December 15, with only days  left in the Senate’s 2011 session. There  is no time to further delay votes on the  other  20  judicial  nominations  now  pending on the Senate calendar and  awaiting a final vote.

2452,485,2011-12-15,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President,  I  wish to thank the chairman  for his  willingness to enter into this colloquy.  We had a discussion, as Senator INHOFE  said, during  the conference meeting  last week in which it now is apparent  that the process through which the  depot language was inserted was not  proper. Senator LEVINhas been very up  front and straight forward with us, and  I appreciate his willingness to do this  today. I know the chairman has already acknowledged  there are problems, and I appreciate his commitment  to not only discuss it today but to revisit these issues as soon as the next  Senate session convenes and address  this  issue through a truly  inclusive  process during which all Members and  stakeholders can express their views.  Clearly, there was a process problem  related to how these provisions wound  up in the bill, and I think we can all  agree that for issues that are as central  to so many Members as the definitions  of  ‘‘depot maintenance’’ and  ‘‘core,’’  the process needs to be inclusive and  extensive and both Houses of Congress  need to be equally involved. That simply did not happen in this case.  Specifically, related to the substance  of the provisions, I am extremely concerned the rewrite of the 10 USC 2464  ‘‘core’’ statute replaces all references  to  ‘‘core  logistics’’  functions  in the  original statute with  ‘‘depot maintenance and repair’’ functions. This basically  redefines  ‘‘core’’  to  be  depot  maintenance only, to exclude other logistics functions such as supply chain  management and product support. This  does  constitute  a  very  significant  change, and I would argue that it is exactly in these areas of logistics functions beyond simple depot maintenance  where the government has the greatest  interest in protecting their own capabilities. Yet the bill defines these activities out of the core definition. This  could very easily result in the government’s ability to employ and therefore  maintain expertise  in areas such as  program management,  supply  chain  management,  and  product  support  management atrophying.  I have no doubt that private industry  applauds  this  change  because  they  would be the ones to presumably pick  up this work. However, we should not  kid ourselves  into thinking  industry  would be cheaper. If the government  loses this or any other depot-related  capability, they will have an extremely  hard time rebuilding that expertise,  and this will only incentivize industry  to charge more for their efforts. This is  clearly a problem and one of the issues  we need to address next year.  Secondly, the waiver in the 2464 rewrite is much broader than previously  and allows for a waiver for military  equipment that is not an enduring element of the national defense strategy.  Perhaps this could make sense at some  level if we knew what this meant, but  we don’t. What an ‘‘enduring element  of the national defense strategy’’ is has  never been defined; hence, we will be at  the mercy of the subjective interpretation of  the Department of Defense.  That is not the way it should be, and  we need to fix that.  The current ‘‘core’’ waiver in 2464 is  much narrower and more defined. The  presumption and philosophy in the current waiver is that work, other than  work on commercial items, will be considered core, and only considered not  core when it is clear it no longer needs  to be. The committee’s rewrite changes  that presumption based on new standards which are unclear.  In addition to the two specific issues  I have raised, there may be other unintended consequences to these changes  of which we are unaware since we have  had limited time, as Senator INHOFE  said, to vet them and are just now receiving  feedback  from  some of  the  stakeholders.  During the chairman’s remarks and  in  response,  I would appreciate his  commitment to revisit these issues as  soon as we can next year. I encourage  DOD to go slowly in implementing any  changes since there is a good chance we  will make  additional  changes  next  year. I appreciate as well his commitment to include a legislative package  in next year’s national defense authorization bill that gets it right.  Again, I thank both Senator LEVIN  and Senator MCCAIN for allowing us to  address this issue and for their willingness to cooperate as we move forward  next year to clear this matter up.  ",2011

2454,485,2011-12-15,Mrs. HAGAN.," Mr. President, I wish  to thank the chairman and the ranking  member for allowing this colloquy to  take place. I also wish to state that I  believe  the Senator  from Oklahoma  laid out a little bit of the groundwork  of what we are discussing now.  I rise to discuss the depot maintenance  issues  associated  with  the  House-adopted  language  in  the conference. We must avoid doing anything  that may upset the existing balance between DOD’s internal depots, logistic  centers, arsenals and specialty facilities,  and  the  industrial  base. The  House-adopted provision  can disrupt  that delicate balance and have unintended  consequences. We  just don’t  know who may be impacted. We need  time to get this right, and we need to  ensure a transparent process in which  all stakeholders can make their position known to Members of Congress.  The sensitivity associated with maintenance workload  is at an all-time  high. Disrupting the balance of depot-  level maintenance comes at a  time  when our economy is struggling and  when  DOD  is  consolidating  depot  source-of-repair work for current and  emerging weapons systems. Additionally, prematurely disrupting the readiness of our weapons systems fleet is  not an option, especially with the operational tempo of our military.  It is critically important to preserve  the  capability  and  competencies  of  DOD’s  internal  depot-level maintenance facilities while also sustaining  the defense industrial base in order to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:21 Dec 16, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G15DE6.033 S15DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011
2455,492,2011-12-15,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. President, these generals put it right to the  point we all need to hear: Our ideals  are assets, not liabilities. In that spirit, interestingly enough, we had a very  robust debate about these detention  provisions, and it bolstered my faith  we could continue to have great and  substantive debates in this body. Because of the concerns that were raised  and serious questions that were presented about the provisions, we were  able to secure some improvements that  may reduce some of the grave concerns  I have outlined here.  I see my good friend from Illinois,  who I know is going to speak and who  shares some of my concerns, so let me  touch on a couple of the adjustments  that have been made.  Senator  amendment  clarified that detainee provisions are  not to be interpreted ‘‘to affect existing law or authorities relating to the  detention of United States citizens.’’  I was a member of the conference  committee on this bill, and during the  conference committee negotiations resulted in a clarification that was made  to ensure these provisions are not to be  interpreted  to  ‘‘affect  the  existing  criminal enforcement and national security authorities of the FBI or any  other domestic law enforcement agency.’’ These were helpful changes and,  hopefully, will  prevent  the  undermining of our constitutional liberties  and the disruption of domestic counterterrorism efforts.  However, while I was pleased my colleagues were willing to acknowledge  the  language presented serious problems and  left many questions unanswered, I still remain concerned about  the  detention  provisions.  Making  changes to the law that have serious  ramifications for our Constitution and  our national security deserve serious  thought and deliberation. Yet to this  day we have not had a single hearing  on these matters. Hearings would allow  us to understand and mitigate the concerns of national security experts such  as  FBI Director Mueller. Director  Mueller testified yesterday in front of  the Senate Judiciary Committee and  said that because of the requirements  of this language, ‘‘the possibility looms  that we will lose opportunities to obtain cooperation from the persons in  the past that we’ve been fairly successful in gaining.’’  One of our primary goals in these  cases is to gain actionable intelligence,  and the FBI is very good—in fact, they  are unbelievably good—at using a variety of techniques to gather the information we need—techniques, by  the  way, that fit within the Bill of Rights  and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Some of my colleagues believe  that intelligence will be lost if a suspect receives a Miranda warning, but  now we may be  jeopardizing entire  cases by adding new layers of bureaucracy and questionable legal processes.  These detention provisions, even as  they are amended, will present numerous constitutional questions that the  courts will inevitably have to resolve,  and  the  provisions  will  present  logistical problems that our national  security  experts will have  to wade  through. It sure feels to me as though  these changes are being forced on an  already nimble and effective counterterrorism  community  against  their  warnings, and I remain unconvinced of  their benefit. I continue to believe the  best course of action would be to separate these detention provisions  from  the Defense authorization bill so we  can take our time, speak to experts in  the field, and make sure we are effectively balancing our counterterrorism  needs and the constitutional freedoms  of American  citizens. Most  importantly, we need to understand and we  need to ensure we are not damaging  our national security. That is why I  made it clear in signing the conference  report that I do not support the two  flawed detention provisions, sections  1021 and 1022.  All of that said, the Senate has a solemn obligation to our men and women  in uniform to pass a Defense Authorization Act. As a proud member of the  Senate Armed Services Committee, I  understand the importance of this bill  for our military and for their families,  and while I continue to have serious  reservations about the detention provisions and sought to separate them from  the Defense authorization bill, we face  a single vote on the entirety of the Defense bill, which includes the amended  detention provisions. That is not how I  wanted  to proceed, but  that  is  the  choice in front of us.  For those who joined me in voicing  opposition to the detention provisions,  I thank you. We fought to ensure that  the rights of American citizens are not  trampled with ease, and we joined the  counterterrorism  community  to  demand the full use of existing tools to  fight the enemy. We showed that such  a debate was worth having and secured  revisions to the language that will now  help us continue the important work of  ensuring that both our Constitution  and our national security remain protected.  Although I intend to vote for final  passage of the conference bill, I want  to make clear I do not fully support  the bill. I sincerely believe this debate  is not over and there is much work left  to do. Over the coming months and  years, as a member of  the Senate  Armed Services Committee, I intend to  hold this administration, and any further  administration,  accountable  in  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:09 Dec 16, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G15DE6.045 S15DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011
2456,499,2011-12-15,Mr. COONS.," Mr. President, today I  rise to express my deep concern that  the 2012 National Department of Defense Authorization Act provisions pertaining to detainee treatment fail to  strike the appropriate, important balance between national security, due  process, and civil  liberties. Sections  1021, 1022, and 1023 are the latest in a  series of legislative proposals that provide ever-narrowing latitude for dealing with terrorism suspects, whether in  the U.S. or abroad.  I am concerned, that these provisions  take us one small, but significant, step  down the road towards a state in which  ordinary citizens  live  in  fear of the  military, rather than the free society  that has marked  this great nation  since the Bill of Rights was ratified 220  years ago, in 1791.  The new detention authorities thrust  upon our military in this bill are an assault on our civil liberties and do not  belong on our books. They were not requested by the Pentagon, in fact they  have been resisted by the President,  the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney  General, and the directors of National  Intelligence and the FBI. They do not  make us safer and, to the contrary,  they will create dangerous confusion  within our national security community.  Under  these  sections, a  terrorism  suspect must be remanded to U.S. military custody, even when that suspect  presents no imminent threat to public  safety and  is being held under suspicion of committing a U.S. crime. The  suspect may be held indefinitely. Indeed, if the suspect is transferred to  Guantanamo, it may be a practical reality that the suspect must be held indefinitely, thanks to the onerous certification  requirements contained  in  Section 1023. If not sent to Guantanamo, the suspect may be rendered to  a foreign power, where he may be subject to coercive interrogation, torture,  or death. Or, the individual may simply  remain in custody of our own military,  waiting for the cessation of an endless  conflict against an idea.  As my colleagues from Vermont and  Oregon, from Colorado and California,  have already said so eloquently, these  provisions reflect an unfortunate and  unwise shift away  from the current  law, in which the criminal justice system is presumed to be sufficient for  those who commit crimes on U.S. soil.  No system is perfect, but the federal  criminal justice system is considered  by many around the world to be the  gold  standard  for  fairness,  transparency and reliability. Since 9/11, the  civilian criminal process has been successful  in  securing  convictions  and  lengthy sentences against hundreds of  terrorism suspects.  This is compared to just six convictions in military tribunals, and two of  these  individuals  are walking  free  today. A third, Ibrahim al Qosi, was  convicted of being a Taliban fighter.  Under his sentence of 2 years, he would  be due to be released next summer. But  when he serves his sentence, he likely  will not be released. Instead, he will be  detained until our undefined hostilities  against  Islamic  extremism and  terrorism conclude.  In other words, he  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:21 Dec 16, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G15DE6.060 S15DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

2458,506,2011-12-15,Mr. KIRK.," Madam President, I wish  to rise  in support of the Feinstein-  Leahy-Lee legislation. We are taking  up the Defense authorization bill with  the  controversial  provisions  in  it,  somewhat protected already by  the  Feinstein  language. But this  legislation locks in a fundamental truth that  I think is important for our country,  and that is as a U.S. citizen inside the  territory of  the United States, you  have inalienable rights under our Declaration of Independence. We are protected pursuant to the U.S. Constitution.  Our Constitution says all crimes, and  prosecution thereof, shall be pursuant  to a grand jury indictment. There is no  exception in the Constitution for that.  The Constitution grants a U.S. citizen  a trial in the State in which the crime  was committed, I think clearly envisioning a civilian trial. We, as Americans, have a right to a speedy trial, not  indefinite detention.  We as Americans have a right to a  jury of our peers, which I would argue  is not enlisted or military personnel  sitting in a jury. You cannot search  our persons or our places of business or  homes without probable cause under  the Bill of Rights. You cannot be deprived of your freedom or your property without due process of law, and  that, I would say, is not indefinite detention. All due process guarantees  under law are granted to you by the  14th  amendment.  I would  actually  argue that no statute and no Senate  and no House can take these rights  away from you.  It is very important to pass this legislation to prevent needless litigation  against constitutional rights, which I  regard already as your birthright as an  American citizen. It is very important  to talk about what the Feinstein legislation does and does not do. I think it  is very narrowly crafted to defend the  rights of American citizens and resident aliens inside the United States.  We agree that aliens who are engaged  or captured on foreign battlefields can  be subjected to rough justice, battlefield outcomes, or detention and prosecution by the U.S. military.  We even agree that a U.S. citizen  such as Anwar al-Awlaki, who took up  arms against the United States from  his terrorist base, Yemen, is then the  proper subject of U.S. military action,  and he received that proper attention.  Illegal aliens, even inside the United  States—we are not engaging on that  subject. If they are part of jihad or  other  warfare  against  the  United  States, they can be subjected to military jurisdiction. But with regard to  U.S. citizens and resident aliens on  U.S. soil, I would argue that the entire  point of the Department of Defense is  to defend our constitutional rights and  to make sure they are honored. If you  read  the Constitution—and  I would  urge all Members  in  this battle  to  reread it; it is only 5,000 words long—  you will see that the rights provided  are without qualification and are part  of your birthright.  What is the first thing a U.S. Senator, a Member of Congress, or the  President does? They swear an oath to  the Constitution of the United States.  What is the first act any American or  resident alien joining the U.S. military  does? They don’t swear allegiance to a  President or a leader or a territory;  they swear allegiance to the U.S. Constitution,  and  that  is  the mission  which they are undertaking to protect.  We see a number of cases cited—as I  noted, Ex parte Quirin, the German  spy, or U.S. nationals who landed in  Long Island and were summarily executed under U.S. military  justice.  I  would say at least they were part of a  foreign military and trained  in that  mission and trying to carry out that  mission when that rough justice was  put in place.  With regard to Jose Padilla, he was a  U.S. citizen—sometimes when I was at  the State Department, people would  ask me who our Ambassador to Puerto  Rico was. Puerto Rico is part of the  United States. He was a full member of  the country, with U.S. citizenship. He  was arrested at O’Hare Airport, but  pursuant to executive action was immediately taken into military custody  and held in a brig. I regard all of his  constitutional  rights were  then violated. In the subsequent litigation, I  think eventually the Bush administration realized they were about to lose  this case, which is why they kicked  him back into civilian court.  In the Hamdi case, which is so often  cited, even there we at least had a foreign connection,  foreign  training as  part of another battlefield. What we  are talking about here is very narrow,  to make sure at the very least that  you, as a U.S. citizen in U.S. territory,  are not going to be subjected to indefinite military detention and military  justice, that all of your constitutional  rights are adhered to.  I would simply ask this—also as a reserve naval officer—what U.S. military  officer wants the duty to roll in, for example, to Peoria, IL, and arrest an  American citizen for actions that citizen has  only  done  in  the United  States, not connected to a foreign military or training, and then to put that  person through military detention and  justice? I would say for the long-term  interest of the U.S. military and to  protect the U.S. military, we do not  want  to  give  that mission  to  our  Armed Forces. A point of  common  sense should prevail here as well.  We spend billions of dollars on the  Department  of Homeland  Security,  which  is  fully under the  fourth and  sixth  amendments  of  our  constitutional protection. We have an extraordinarily able FBI, ATF, DEA, et cetera,  the whole panoply of Federal law enforcement, which, quite properly,  is  not under the administration of the  Pentagon but is instead under the administration of the Department of Justice. We have a vast array of State and  local law enforcement all dedicated to  protecting the United States but, most  importantly, to uphold the very oaths  they also take in their first minute as  law enforcement officers to protect the  U.S. Constitution.  So on this day that we pass the  NDAA, which has a murky provision  regarding this—somewhat protected by  the Feinstein  legislation—it  is very  important for us then to rally behind  the  further  legislative  protections  here. I think this is strong, bipartisan  legislation. I commend Senator FEINSTEIN, Chairman LEAHY, and Senator  LEE for bringing it forward. No. 1, this  will help protect  the U.S. military  from missions that it should not undertake. No. 2, we will make sure there is  clear delineation between the Department of Justice, Homeland Security,  and its whole panoply of agencies, and  our military, which protects our rights  from threat overseas. But, most importantly, No. 3, to defend the U.S. Constitution, your birthright as an American citizen to have these rights to  make sure we do not subject any U.S.  citizen apprehended inside the United  States to  indefinite detention under  U.S. military authority, knowing they  have inalienable birthrights that were  granted to them by the U.S. Constitution.  With that, I commend the Chair.  ",2011

2464,513,2011-12-15,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  it  seems  the President  of  the United  States has finally acknowledged that  the economy is in a terrible state and  there is nothing he can do about it. So,  rather than offer new ideas to grow the  economy, the President has now shifted into blame mode. I recognize that  the slow economic growth and high levels of unemployment are having a significant impact on the middle class.  But rather than listen to political rhetoric and witness  finger pointing by  President  Obama,  the  unemployed  would likely prefer ideas, ideas on how  to turn this economy around.  I presume President Obama aspired  to lead the country because he believed  he had the vision and the ability to  lead to a more prosperous nation. But  beyond  the vision, a President also  needs a plan and the leadership to put  that vision into place. Where is that  leadership? During the past 3 years, we  witnessed President Obama’s theory on  economic stimulus. We saw a massive  expansion of government and deficit  spending. More than $800 billion was  spent on a  failed economic stimulus  bill that was supposed to keep unemployment below 8 percent. But it did  not. Government spending in the process has reached an unprecedented level.  Today, the size of government, if you  combine local, State, and Federal, is 40  percent of our gross national product.  One hundred years ago when Teddy  Roosevelt delivered his speech in Kansas, it was 8 percent. I refer to Teddy  Roosevelt and the speech in Kansas because  the President  of  the United  States now  tried  to duplicate  that  speech 100 years later.  Today, government consumes 40 percent of the entire economy. According  to  economic  policies  of  President  Obama, government needs to grow even  bigger to help our economy, and in the  process there is a goal to use government to redistribute wealth. If government gets a little bit bigger, the argument goes, and if it gets a little more  involved, and particularly if it gets involved in every facet of our economy  and our lives, that will surely increase  economic prosperity of all Americans.  Right?  Of course not. All of this has led to  taxes and deficit spending that crowd  out private investment that could grow  the economy and, in the process, create  jobs. Government doesn’t create self-  sustaining jobs; government only creates government jobs. The private sector creates jobs. It is the responsibility  of the government to create an environment that leads to job growth.

2465,520,2011-12-15,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  stand today to honor an outstanding  Kentucky hero and patriot, SPC John  O. Berry, Jr. SPC Berry is a veteran of  the Vietnam war who has received numerous awards and commendations for  his heroism and bravery in serving his  country.  John O. Berry, Jr., of Wayne County,  KY, grew up a typical kid—he spent his  time hanging out with friends, listening to music, and enjoying time spent  with his brothers and sisters. On September  18,  1968, however, John answered a call to duty, and his life was  forever changed when he  joined the  U.S. Army.  John received his introduction to the  Army and basic training at Fort Knox,  KY, before being sent to Fort Leonard  Wood, MO, to complete his advanced  training. Four  short months  later,  John had achieved the honor of combat  demolition specialist with Company A,  299th Engineer Battalion, and was sent  to a fire base in North Vietnam.  John’s job was especially dangerous.  He was responsible  for ensuring the  roads were  free of the many deadly  land mines  that were  strategically  placed by  the Viet Cong. Although  scores of Americans were killed by  these mines, John and other courageous demolition engineers were responsible for saving thousands of additional lives by dismantling the mines  throughout the war.  Over  the years John has  received  many distinguished awards and honors  for his bravery and service to our country. Included in these honors are two  Purple Hearts, two Army Commendation Medals for heroism and exceptionally meritorious achievement  in the  Republic of Vietnam, two National Defense medals, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm, which  was awarded by the Republic of Vietnam to those who display valor and heroic conduct in combat.  These awards only represent a small  portion of the gratitude we owe John  for his selflessness and courage. According  to  the Department  of  the  Army’s account of a rescue mission in  which John’s unit was sent to aid an  ambushed team,  ‘‘John distinguished  himself by exceptionally valorous action. . . . He demonstrated admirable  courage and devotion to duty as he unflinchingly performed his task without  regard to personal safety. His actions  were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect  great credit upon himself, his unit and  the United States Army.’’  Mr. President, I would ask that my  Senate colleagues join me in thanking  SPC John O. Berry, Jr. for his sacrifice  and service. John’s heroism is truly inspiring, and the people of our great  Commonwealth are grateful  for his  selflessness and  service. The Wayne  County Outlook recently published an  article thanking Specialist Berry and  highlighting his  accomplishments.  I  ask unanimous consent that the full  article be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORDas follows:  [From the Wayne County Outlook, Nov. 9,  2011]  BERRYRECEIVEDMEDALSFORSERVICETOHIS  COUNTRY  (By Harlan Ogle)  Here’s  the way  the Department of  the  Army tells the story: He ‘‘distinguished himself by exceptionally valorous action  . . .  while serving as a member of a reactionary  force sent to aid the mine sweep team which  had been ambushed. . . . When he and other  members of the reaction force dismounted  their vehicle they immediately came under  heavy enemy fire. With complete disregard  for his own safety, [he] formed one line with  the other members of the force and moved  towards the front. He and the others laid  down a base of  fire which  enabled  the  trapped mine sweep to break contact. The reaction force then advanced still further into  the kill zone to continue firing while Delta  Company’s casualties were carried out. [He]  demonstrated admirable courage and devotion to duty as he unflinchingly performed  his tasks without regard to his personal safety. His cool-headedness in the face of conditions which would unnerve a weaker man  served to inspire his comrades to follow suit.  [His] actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and  the United States Army.’’  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:55 Dec 16, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G15DE6.090 S15DEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 7 K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011
2466,527,2011-12-15,Mr. KOHL.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce the Equity for Visual Artists Act of 2011. This bill would  enable visual artists to benefit from  their copyrights in a meaningful way  similar to other creators of  literary  and artistic works such as authors,  playwrights and composers. It provides  for the payment of a copyright royalty  long recognized in international law to  be paid at the time a work of visual art  is sold at auction in the United States.  Half of this royalty payment will go directly to the artists or their estate and  the other half will be made available to  nonprofit American art museums as an  endowment to be used by them to purchase the works of  living American  artists so that these works may be  freely enjoyed by everyone.  Like all authors, the primary legal  right of an artist in his or her work is  the copyright. Yet, visual artists stand  alone within America’s creative community in their inability to gain any  significant income under existing copyright law. As an example, creators of  music will collect nearly $2 billion in  copyright royalty payments this year.  By contrast, America’s visual artists  receive only a tiny amount of copyright  income, primarily when  their  works are reproduced in publications  such as museum catalogues. Visual art  often generates money only when the  original work itself is first sold. The  vast majority of money-making sales  are not by artists themselves but by  collectors, dealers and auction houses  who trade in their works after their  first sale. Under current law artists receive no income from these sales.  For nearly 100 years  international  copyright law under the Berne Convention on Literary and Artistic Works, of  which the United States is a party, has  given artists a right to royalties each  time their works are resold. However,  unlike other rights protected under the  Convention,  individual countries are  not required to recognize the artists’  resale right. While over 40 other countries, including all members of the European Union,  provide  their  artists  with income from resale of their works,  the United States does not. Under the  Convention’s  reciprocity  rule,  these  countries will only pay royalties to  artists from countries that also recognize  the  resale  right. As a  result,  American artists  receive no money  from these sales.  In 1990, Congress enacted the Visual  Artists Rights Act  that  asked  the  Copyright Office to study the issue of  resale royalties and report back with  recommendations. The Copyright Office reported back to Congress that creation of new artworks would be encouraged by adoption of the Berne Convention provisions on resale rights, but it  recommended  that we wait  to  see  whether  the European Union would  first require all of its member countries to join those like France and Germany who had long provided their artists with such a right. In 2001, the European Union decided to make resale  royalties mandatory  throughout  its  territory, underpinning the Copyright  Office’s initial conclusions about the  positive effects of  introducing resale  rights. In 2006, the United Kingdom was  the last EU country to implement its  law.  In order to make the administration  of a resale right as simple as possible,  the bill would take 7 percent of any  sale $10,000 or more from only the most  public and easily accountable transactions, auction sales, and divide the  amount by artists or their beneficiaries  and non-profit museums to purchase  American art. The  legislation would  apply only to sales by entities that  have $25 million per year of cumulative  sales of visual art. It also excludes entities that solely conduct business in  online auctions over the Internet. The  bill gives primary  responsibility  for  collecting and distributing royalties to  non-governmental collecting societies  with oversight by the Copyright Office  and  reporting  requirements  to Congress.  This  legislation  is a  long overdue  step in fulfilling our obligation under  the Berne Convention to award visual  artists the benefits derived from the resale of their works, a right that literary and musical artists have enjoyed  for decades. Under current law, visual  artists are denied royalties for lucrative sales of their art, and this bill is a  meaningful start  for providing them  with just compensation. It is only fair  that, as  stipulated by  international  law, visual artists profit from the appreciation in value of their work.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 2000  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equity for  Visual Artists Act of 2011’’.  SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

TED POE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, December 15, 2011  ",2011
2468,541,2011-12-15,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, Christians  in Egypt are under attack. The revolution may  have overthrown a longtime dictator, but it has  not  freed Christians  there  from decades of  persecution. In fact, it may have made matters  worse.  Christians in Egypt are a deeply rooted minority of about 10 million in a largely Muslim  society of 81 million. Prior to the revolution,  they had a hard time. Discrimination was not  an official policy of the Mubarak regime—he  didn’t want to lose his aid dollars the U.S. was  giving him—but he sure made  it hard on  Christians. When Christians wanted to build a  new church or renovate their own, they had to  get a permit. That’s fine, except for the fact  that the Mubarak government intentionally delayed the permitting process. Churches would  have to wait years for permits—some churches are still waiting. Mubarak pretended to fix  this problem when he handed permitting control over to the 28 regional governors, but wait  times for a permit didn’t get any better.  They were also discriminated against when  it came to appointments to high-level government and military posts. There were only a  handful of Christians in the upper ranks of the  security services and armed forces. There was  one Christian governor out of 28, one elected  Member of Parliament out of 454 seats, no  known university presidents or deans, and  very  few  legislators or  judges. According  to  the State Department, public university training  programs  for Arabic-language  teachers exclude non-Muslims because the curriculum involves the study of the Koran.  Other discrimination was official  for everyone to see. Under Egyptian law, Muslim men  can marry  Christian  women  but Muslim  women are prohibited from marrying Christian  men.  And sometimes discrimination progressed to  outright violence against Christians.  In September 2010,  in  the Omraneya district of  Cairo, Egyptian authorities reportedly used excessive force and live ammunition on peaceful  demonstrators  protesting  the  government’s  continued refusal to approve a license to build  a local church extension. Two people, including a teenager, were killed, and dozens were  wounded. No one has been brought to justice.  When the government was using excessive  force, it was radical Islamists. On January 1,  2011, a bomb detonated in front of a Coptic  church, Al Qiddissin (Two Saints), in Alexandria, where a New Year’s prayer service was  being held. At least 23 Christians were killed  and nearly 100 wounded  in  the worst sectarian attack on Christians in Egypt in more  than a decade. On January 23, then-Interior  Minister Habib El-Adly asserted  that conclusive evidence pointed  to a militant group,  Army of Islam, as responsible for the attack.  On January 11, 2011, an off-duty police officer opened fire in a train in Minya province,  killing one Christian and  injuring  five others.  The shooter, a Muslim, was charged with murder and will be tried in a state security court.  The Ministry of  Interior denied  the shooting  was sectarian.  When  the  revolution came,  thousands of  Christians fueled the protests, yearning for a  new government that would respect the religious beliefs of its own people. But just a few  weeks after  the  revolution,  it became clear  that Christians were actually in more danger.  During the revolution, a bunch of bad guys  escaped prison. To protect themselves, monks  at the Anba Bishoy monastery north of Cairo  built a security wall. Well, the Egyptian military  didn’t like that very much, so in late February  they  tore down  the wall with machine guns  and bulldozers. You can see video online of  monks  running  for cover as  the military  is  opening  fire with heavy machinery. A monk  and six church workers were  injured  in  the  process.  In February  the governor of el-Minya, demolished 10 Coptic homes because the owners of those homes refused to contribute one-  fifth of their property to build a mosque.  In early March  in Cairo, 13 people were  killed and nearly 150 wounded in clashes that  erupted during large-scale demonstrations by  Christians  protesting  the  destruction  of  a  church in the provincial town of Sol. The demonstrators  called  for  the  rebuilding of  the  church, punishment of perpetrators, and better  treatment by Egyptian authorities. Some of the  demonstrations reportedly blocked major highways. According to some accounts, the Egyptian military stood by for as long as four hours  without intervening in the clashes.  On March 20, in Qena, Salafists, including  an off-duty policeman, accused a Copt named  Ayman Mitri of renting an apartment to a prostitute, cut off one of his ears and mutilated his  other ear. The attackers then informed the police that they had carried out the punishment  required by Islamic law. As was usual under  Mubarak,  the police  refrained  from pressing  charges and called for a ‘‘reconciliation’’ meeting between  the  religious communities. The  Christian man agreed to compensation during  the reconciliation session instead of pursuing  criminal charges because the extremists allegedly threatened his family.  Also as under Mubarak, the authorities’ refusal to punish attacks on Christians has led  to more attacks. On March 23, Salafists surrounded St. George’s church in Beni Ahmad  and successfully demanded that a church expansion  approved  by  the  government  be  stopped. On March 27,  they blockaded St.  Mary’s church in Giza, saying it did not have  a permit. After yet another  ‘‘reconciliation’’  meeting between Copts and Muslims, services  at the church were forbidden until it acquired  a new permit.  On March 28, Salafists attacked a  liquor  store in Kasr El-Bassil owned by a Copt, destroyed other stores, and demanded that coffee shops be closed. One villager was killed  and eight others injured. On April 5, hundreds  occupied St.  John  the Beloved  church  in  Kamadeer, stopping repairs after heavy rain,  and told Copts that they were not allowed to  pray  there anymore. After yet another  ‘‘reconciliation,’’ Copts were told to build a church  200 meters away, one without a dome, cross,  bell, or any other external feature marking it  as a church.  Beginning on April 15, over 10,000 demonstrators, mostly Salafists, protested  in  the  southern province of Qena against  the appointment of a new governor, Emad Mikhail,  who  is a Christian  (the previous governor,  Magdy Ayoub, was also Christian). Protesters  blocked main roads, stopped buses to separate men and women passengers, and disrupted the main rail route in Upper Egypt for  eight days. There were threats to bar Mikhail  from the province and even to kill him. Tensions ran so high that local Christians stayed  inside and couldn’t celebrate Palm Sunday.  The armed forces refused to intervene, and,  although Egypt’s cabinet initially rejected calls  for  the governor’s  resignation, on April 25,  Prime Minister Essam Sheraf surrendered and  said he would  ‘‘freeze’’  the appointment  for  three months.  On April 28, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom for the first time  recommended  to Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton  that Egypt be  labeled a  ‘‘Country of  Particular Concern  (CPC).’’ This designation  refers,  as  commission  chair  Leonard  Leo  noted, to ‘‘the world’s worst religious freedom  violators and human rights abusers.’’  The abuse continues, with  the worst violence against Christians in decades.  On October 9 thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched in downtown Cairo to protest  the attack of a Coptic Christian church  and called for an end to the systematic discrimination against Copts by the Egyptian authorities. At some point in the protest, violent  clashes erupted between  the protesters and  the Egyptian military  forces. Video  shows  Egyptian military  tanks  speeding  through  crowds and running over protesters. At one  point,  the Egyptian State Television aired a  message calling on  ‘‘honorable citizens’’  to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  07:23 Jan 22, 2013 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\DECEMBER\E15DE1.REC E15DE1 h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

2470,548,2011-12-15,Mr. HONDA.," Mr. Speaker, December 5  marked the 84th birthday of His Majesty King  Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. I would like  to take this opportunity to send warm wishes  to him and to the people of Thailand as they  commemorate his 65-year  reign as King of  Thailand.  The world’s  longest-serving monarch, His  Majesty King Bhumibol ascended to the throne  on June 9, 1946. Throughout his reign, King  Bhumibol has both witnessed and been instrumental in the transformation of Thailand into a  prosperous, modern state, with a strong agricultural sector and modernized manufacturing  and services  industries. His contribution  to  such progress and the devotion and compassion he has for the Thai people has earned  King Bhumibol  the  love and  respect of his  people as well as worldwide recognition for his  leadership.  As  a  leading  advocate  for  sustainable,  human-centered development, King Bhumibol  has worked hard to address the critical development issues facing his country and his people, applying scientific knowledge and initiating  development projects  that  take  into account  the topography, traditions and culture of a region. Focusing on agricultural development,  King Bhumibol has overseen thousands of development projects undertaken to improve the  food security and welfare of the Thai people.  His concern about the sustainability of Thailand’s natural resources has spurred several  water  resource  and  reforestation  projects  throughout the country.  I would also like to celebrate the 178-year  diplomatic alliance and  friendship between  Thailand and the United States—one that reflects both common interests and shared values, namely: democracy, good governance,  and  the  rule of  law.  Indeed, on March 20,  1833,  the United States and Thailand (then  known as Siam) signed  the Treaty of Amity  and Commerce, making the Kingdom of Thailand the first treaty ally of the United States in  the Asia-Pacific  region. His Majesty King  Bhumibol’s state visit to the United States in  1960 further cemented the excellent relations  between our two nations.  Lastly, I would like to express my deepest  sympathies to the people of Thailand for the  recent historic floods in Thailand, and reiterate  my support  for both ongoing and additional  humanitarian efforts aimed at providing civilian  and military assistance to save lives, restore  health, and facilitate Thailand’s economic recovery. The United States remains committed  to supporting Thailand’s  long-term  recovery.  The United States government has contributed  significant  humanitarian  assistance, United  States citizens and private sector have donated to reconstruction efforts, and the United  States will continue working to help improve  Thailand’s capacity to prepare and respond to  such disasters in the future.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join our long-  standing  friends,  the people of Thailand, as  they celebrate the 84th birthday anniversary of  His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej and his  esteemed 65-year reign of and dedication to  Thailand.  f  TRIBUTE TO JOHN FRANKLIN  THAMES  HON.

2471,548,2011-12-15,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I stand today  to pay tribute to a constituent who has dedicated his professional career to coaching high  school basketball and—over the past half century—has developed generations of successful  young women while breaking and setting winning records for women’s basketball in South  Carolina.  I commend Coach John Franklin  Thames for his 50 years of coaching women’s  basketball in the Palmetto State. It is very fitting that a scholarship for gifted athletes will  be established in his honor at his alma mater,  Manning High School.  John Thames grew up  in Alcolu, SC and  graduated from Manning High School in 1953.  At that time, America was at war with Korea.  He spent six months as Executive Officer of  Training Company  at  Fort  Jackson,  and  served 13 months in Korea as an Army Tank  Platoon Commander. Following his military  service, he matriculated at Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina, graduated in  1958, and returned home to serve his alma  mater for the next half century.  Over his 44-year career as the Lady Monarchs head  coach, Coach Thames’  teams  amassed  two State Championships,  three  State runner-ups, 15 Regional Championships,  and seven Regional Tournament Championships. He was named Region Coach of  the  Year 14  times and  the Sumter  Item Area  Coach of  the year  three  times.  In 1969, he  was selected as the Pee Dee North-South All-  Star South head coach. He served as head  coach in the South Carolina Athletic Coaches  Association North-South Girls All-Star Game in  1984 and 2000. He was also one of two South  Carolina coaches chosen to coach the South  Carolina All-Star Girls against the North Carolina All-Star Girls at Winthrop University.  Coach Thames was nominated in 1991–92  as  the Converse High School Coach of  the  Year and  the National High School Athletic  Coaches Association Coach of  the Year  in  women’s basketball. That same year, he was  named Florence Morning News Class AAA  Girls Coach of the Year. He has been a South  Carolina Coaches  Association  of Women  Sports MVP Honoree,  and  a  2000 High  School Sports Report State Coach of the Year  in AAA Girls Basketball. He was a 2009 Inaugural Inductee into the South Carolina Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame, and a 2011 Inaugural Inductee into the Clarendon County Athletic Hall of Fame.  Coach Thames has also had great success  in other sports. He served as  the Manning  High School baseball coach for 14 years and  as an assistant football coach for 36 years.  In 1993, his high school alma mater—and  50-year employer—named  its gymnasium  in  his honor for ‘‘his lifetime of contributions to  Manning High School.’’ Presbyterian College  also honored their esteemed graduate by recognizing Coach Thames as the 2011 recipient  of  the Bob Waters Award. This honor was  given for his outstanding leadership and service  to society and  the profession of athletic  coaching and  for personifying  those values  and qualities of excellence and integrity held  dear by his college alma mater.  Despite all  the accolades he has accrued  over his career, Coach Thames will be  remembered most for his generosity and love of  his players and all  students. Since 2004,  Coach Thames has conducted a  free one-  week basketball camp  for girls. He  is committed to ensuring that the inability to pay is  not an obstacle for any girl to participate in the  sport. For years, Coach Thames has used his  personal funds to buy shoes for all of his players. He has done so because he doesn’t want  to single out the ones who cannot afford new  shoes. He provides  transportation and other  clothing  for many of his students who have  limited resources. Coach Thames is also dedicated to helping students get into higher education  institutions so  they can pursue  their  dreams.  ‘‘Coach,’’ as he’s  lovingly known  to  everyone including non-athletes, is a mentor  and father figure.  In  addition  to  his  coaching  accolades,  Coach Thames has  twice been named  the  Manning High School Teacher of the Year. He  received the 2008 Outstanding South Carolina  Teacher of U.S. History by the Daughters of  the American Revolution. He was  inducted  into the Kappa Alpha Order Court of Honor in  2009. Coach Thames is a recipient of the Silver Crescent,  the highest civilian recognition  awarded by  the State of South Carolina  for  outstanding dedication to a local community,  and has been  inducted  into  the Clarendon  County  Education  Hall  of  Fame.
