0,4,2011-01-06,Mr. TERRY.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  follow up with my  colleague JEFF  FORTENBERRY’s thoughts.  The school  in my district, Millard  South, endured the ultimate tragedy  when a student, who was suspended, returned with a gun. He walked into the  assistant principal’s office and  shot  her. Ms. Kaspar later died.  My profound  sorrow of  this  incident—the ultimate parents’ nightmare.  My kids attend that school district; so  we were getting the call about the  lockdown. I don’t think there is anything more disturbing to a parent anywhere than when the veil of safety of a  school has been pierced by such violence.  The principal, who was also shot, is  going to survive. He is also a neighbor  of ours, and so I am glad that he will be  fine.  I ask this floor and our colleagues on  both  sides of  the aisle  to  join  the  Omaha community in expressing the  depth of our sorrows. I ask for your  prayers for not only the students of  that school but for all of the teachers,  for the family of the assistant principal  who died, and for the principal who is  fighting for his life right now. I appreciate everyone’s concern.  f  THE HYPOCRISY OF THE  ELIMINATION OF PAYGO  (Mr. MORAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2011
1,4,2011-01-06,Mr. MORAN.," Horrible tragedies like  that cited by the two previous speakers  remind us that there are simply too  many guns too readily available to too  many children. It has got to stop.  On a very different subject, though,  Mr. Speaker, when Ronald Reagan ran  for President, he said that any President who does not submit a balanced  budget should be impeached. He never  did balance a budget. In fact, the only  times that our budget has been balanced was during the Clinton administration as a result of what is called  PAYGO—that  you  don’t  increase  spending without  increasing  a  concomitant amount of revenue; and you  don’t cut taxes without immediately  cutting the same amount of spending.  That worked. We had three successive  years  of  budget  surpluses,  and we  passed on a $5.6 trillion projected surplus to the Bush administration.  Yet, as soon as the new Republican  Congress came in at the beginning of  the  21st  century,  they  eliminated  PAYGO. Two wars, two deep tax cuts  and a massive expansion of Medicare  were never paid for. As a result, we had  a $9 trillion fiscal reversal. When the  Democrats came back in, we reinstated  it; but yesterday the new Republican  Congress  exempted  $5  trillion  from  PAYGO—$4 trillion of unpaid-for tax  cuts and $1.3 trillion of savings we  could have gotten from health care reform.  It  is the height of hypocrisy and  deeply disappointing.  f  THE  14TH AMENDMENT OF THE  CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED  STATES  (Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2011
2,4,2011-01-06,Mr. PERLMUTTER.," I first want to  extend the sympathies of Colorado and  of the Representatives to our friends  from Nebraska. We suffered the Columbine tragedy a number of years ago,  so we definitely understand how painful something like this is.  Mr. Speaker, the purpose for me rising today is to talk about what has  been given to this country in the form  of the Constitution, particularly in the  14th Amendment.  I would say to my friend from Texas,  ‘‘nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without  due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal  protection of the laws.’’  Until  we  passed  that  affordable  health care act, people with pre-existing conditions were being denied equal  protection of the laws. We passed that.  They now have freedom from discrimination. Yet my friends on the Republican side of the aisle want to take  away  that  freedom. That’s wrong.  That’s wrong for people in my district  and for millions of people across the  country because they, their kids, their  families, and their  friends have different physical conditions that require  attention and must be covered and not  discriminated against.  f  THE SUPREME COURT NEEDS A  LESSON  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2011
3,4,2011-01-06,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, in a few  minutes, we are going to have the reading of the United States Constitution—  a show for the American public—for  anybody who knows anything about  constitutional law knows that it is up  to nine men and women as to what the  Constitution says.  When the Constitution was originally  drafted—and I love it and I defend it—  it didn’t give women the right to vote,  and  it said slavery was permissible.  Until the vilified Warren Court, in its  correct decision in Brown v. Board of  Education, it said separate was equal,  and we knew it wasn’t. African Americans were held back with Jim Crow  laws.  Five people on the Supreme Court,  not the whole nine, can make decisions  that change the way the Constitution  is interpreted.  Bush v. Gore, an abomination of a  case that determined the Presidency  for  8 years and  took away States’  rights. The Citizens United case funded  the opposition that turned in the majority that the Republicans now have.  Making  corporations  the  equal of  people and putting money into politics  poisoned the political system. The Supreme Court should read the Constitution. They need a lesson.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2011

But being appointed to the Appropriations Committee, it is clear, and I  have made it clear to my constituents,  that I am not going on as a spender.  I’m going on as a saver. It seems for far  too long Members would seek to be on  appropriations because they wanted to  spend money. Well, guess what. It’s a  new day, a new era. And it’s a just  fresh day when you have Members  going on to say, Here is how we are  going to save money. So what a great  debate we are going to have in the next  several weeks.  ",2011
53,28,2011-01-06,Mr. AKIN.," That’s good. Now, let’s get  on to this just a little bit more. Let’s  try to get into the details in terms of  procedurally. Okay, now you’ve got a  new Congress. Republicans are in the  majority, and we’ve got the problem.  When you take a look at the numbers  and we’re spending a third more than  what we’re taking in, we know we’ve  got to do some cutting. But yet one of  the things that people want to pin us  down on, okay, you guys are such big  mouths about cutting spending, what  are you not going to  fund? Because  there is going to be some group that is  going to get mad at you. So how are  you going to it approach it?  And one thing that I know in State  governments  they  do  sometimes  is  E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o they say, Well, what we’ve got to do is,  we’re 10 percent over budget, so we  need to cut 10 percent off of everything. That makes it seem to be fair.  And that would be one way you might  approach what we’ve got going on.  ",2011
54,28,2011-01-06,Mr. GRAVES of Georgia.," Oh, you are  absolutely right. I think what we’ve  heard  about  repealing ObamaCare—  yesterday I introduced the legislation  again to defund it, to take away all authorizing funds going to the legislation  as well, which is another step forward.  You know, why don’t we defund some  czars. That’s a whole other discussion  that we’ve all seen.  And then as we move back to those  2008 levels, and we might need to go  even just a little bit further and begin  cutting more and more and more, I  mean, are the decisions going to be difficult? Sure, they are. But that’s why  your constituents and mine elected us  to come here and make those tough decisions.  ",2011
55,28,2011-01-06,Mr. AKIN.," Congressman GRAVES, let  me lay out two ways you could approach it. If you’ve got just a little bit  you’ve got to cut, you could maybe  take a little bit from everything. But  there’s another way you could take a  look at it when you’ve got to cut one-  third. One way you could do it would  be to say, What are the essential functions that the Federal Government has  to do, and what are things that we really don’t have to do because a State  could do it or the private sector could  do it?  I yield to the Chair.  SWEARINGINOFMEMBERS  FITZPATRICK and FITZPATRICK  The  SPEAKER.  If Representative  SESSIONSof Texas and Representative  of Pennsylvania would  present themselves in the well.  Messrs. SESSIONS appeared at the bar of the House, and  the Speaker administered the oath of  office to them as follows:  Do you solemnly swear or affirm that  you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against  all enemies, foreign and domestic; that  you will bear true faith and allegiance  to the same; that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and  that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which  you are about to enter, so help you  God.  Congratulations. You are now officially Members.  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Ms.  BEUTLER). The  gentleman  from Missouri may resume.  ",2011
56,28,2011-01-06,Mr. AKIN.," So we were just talking  about now you’ve got the situation  with the Federal Government spending  a third more than it takes in. So we’ve  got to  figure out some way of how  we’re going to skin this cat.  And one way is to just try to take a  certain 10 percent or whatever the percentage is. Actually, it would be 33 percent off of everything or whatever. Or  what you could say would be, what are  the things that we have to do, and  HERRERA what are the things that maybe are  nice but we can’t afford it, and what  are the things that may be actually unconstitutional. And  I  suspect when  you’re one-third over budget, it’s going  to be hard to just do a set percentage  across the board. I suspect we’re going  to get into, I think, some very interesting questions about what’s really  constitutional and does  the Federal  Government  really have  to do  that  function? Maybe  it’s  an  important  thing to get done, but maybe the Federal Government shouldn’t do it. So I  just wondered if you wanted to jump in  on that subject.  ",2011
57,28,2011-01-06,Mr. GRAVES of Georgia.," Yes, I would  be happy to just add a little bit more  to that.  I think a few approaches you could  take when you ask the question, Is it  duplicative? Is it occurring somewhere  else? Is another agency or Department  doing  it? And  that  is after you’ve  cleared the hurdle. Is it a role of the  Federal Government in general itself?  Then you could also ask, is it something you could devolve back to the  States? Have we usurped the States in  which I would think many Members of  our conference here would probably  agree. In some cases, the Federal Government has overstepped  its bounds,  and it’s time to remove ourselves from  the States and allow the States to take  over.  But you know, from a business owner’s perspective, what if you looked at  the Department heads or the agency  heads, and you said, You go back and  you cut 25 percent and you bring back  your recommendations; and then you  show us a budget estimate with 20 percent cuts and then one with 10 percent,  empower those agency heads to make  those decisions, to analyze their Departments and come back.  b1450  While we’re also on the theme of physicians, we’re  taking a  surgical approach as well as pulling out those unnecessary programs. So that would be  some approaches I would take.  ",2011
58,28,2011-01-06,Mr. AKIN.," Well, those are some great  recommendations here. To  reinforce  what you’ve said, I didn’t have time to  get some of the charts that we normally have printed, but here’s some examples.  We’ve got 342 economic development  programs. Do you think we really need  342 of them? Talk about duplicative.  That seems to make your point.  ",2011
59,28,2011-01-06,Mr. GRAVES of Georgia., With unemployment at what?  ,2011
60,28,2011-01-06,Mr. AKIN.," 10 percent or whatever. 130  programs serving the disabled. Do we  need 130? Maybe it would be better to  consolidate, just do a couple of good  ones.  And then 130 programs serving at-  risk youth. And so these are all of  these things where you say it doesn’t  even make common sense. We have to  really  start getting  into analyzing,  first of all, should we even be doing it,  and then, if we should, do we need hundreds of programs doing  something  that should be done with one or two.  l a e n b j VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:46 Aug 19, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\H06JA1.REC H06JA1         ",2011
61,36,2011-01-06,Mr. COHEN., And they will control  the amendments that will be permitted  to be discussed on this floor. I know  Speaker BOEHNERsaid we were going to  be able to have amendments and be  able to have good discourse.  ,2011
62,36,2011-01-06,Mr. GARAMENDI.," As you know—I  saw you  in Rules Committee earlier  today—it  is my  impression that the  Rules Committee is going to prohibit  any amendments on the  floor. We’ll  see. I mean, that has yet to be decided  by  the Rules Committee. We don’t  know, but surely the one amendment I  would propose is: don’t do it, maintain  the Patient’s Bill of Rights, maintain  these protections that we all need.  There’s not a person in this Nation  that is not subject to the possibility of  an incident that would become a reason for rescission. That’s my experience. Eight years hammering the insurance  industry, you have  got  to  honor your contract. Yet because of  the laws, they were able to wiggle out  of an expensive incident.  ",2011
63,36,2011-01-06,Mr. COHEN.," When I was a child, I had  polio when I was 5 years old in 1954. I  was fortunate. My father was a doctor,  and so sometimes professional courtesy, but I’m sure he had insurance  that covered my hospitalization. But  there were years later, I think it was 11  years later I had a tendon-lengthening  operation  that was  immediately  related to my polio and necessary on my  Achilles tendon. That wouldn’t have  been  permitted  necessarily  if  they  could use the pre-existing condition  such as polio to have denied coverage;  and whether or not how my  father  dealt with the expense and whether it’s  because he was a physician, I don’t  know; but I’d hate to see children in  the same situation and parents in the  same situation not be permitted to get  that type of coverage later on.  ",2011
64,36,2011-01-06,Mr. GARAMENDI.," I don’t know  if  you were a Member of Congress at the  time, but we all under this law would  have the same policy that every American would have. We wouldn’t have any  different  policy  than  the American  public would have, and the question  about rescission, and you’re a prime  candidate should you lose office, which  you shouldn’t, to be uninsurable if the  Patient’s Bill of Rights were repealed.  Under the Patient’s Bill of Rights, if  you were to leave Congress, you could  get an  insurance policy because the  pre-existing condition that you have,  polio, and an operation resulting from  the polio would go into play as a pre-  existing condition, and you would not  be able to get an insurance policy.  ",2011
65,36,2011-01-06,Mr. COHEN.," Let me, if I can, read  something that I’ve had prepared for  today that came from a constituent’s  story, John Hopkins; and I know John  Hopkins. He’s a very important and active member  in my community and  contemporary. He sent me an email,  and Mr. Hopkins requests I share this  story with the House as we consider repeal of the Affordable Care Act. I want  to share it with everybody here on C–  SPAN.  John was diagnosed with two unrelated cancers during his  life. If you  know anything about cancer, getting it  twice for unrelated reasons is almost  unheard of, but it happened to John  Hopkins. Midway through his first bout  with cancer, he was, of course, dropped  from his health insurance plan. He was  left with a medical bill that wiped out  his and his wife’s entire retirement  savings, as well as the value of their  house. They were never able to repay  the debt in their lifetime. When he was  diagnosed with a second bout of cancer  2 years later, he had no health insurance because there was no insurer anywhere in the market who would offer  him a policy because of the pre-existing condition.  He got some coverage in Tennessee  because of a plan called Access Tennessee for uninsurables, but it was limited to $250,000 a year. As we all know,  annual limits are set to be phased out  by 2014 because of this law, and lifetime limits are already a thing of the  past. A quarter of a million dollars  may seem like a lot of coverage; but  when somebody needs something like a  bone marrow transplant to cure their  leukemia, that single treatment would  exceed the annual cap.  My Republican colleagues have decided their first priority as the new  majority will be repealing the Affordable Care Act; and when they vote to  do this, they will be voting for the following: denying Mr. Hopkins the ability to enroll in a health insurance plan  that doesn’t discriminate against him  for daring to be diagnosed with cancer  again. They will deny John Hopkins  the ability to enroll in a health plan  that will actually continue to cover his  treatment after he exhausts the current annual cap of $250,000, an amount  that many cancer patients meet in a  matter of weeks upon diagnosis,  let  alone those who are fighting two cancers over a number of years.  And it will send a message to John  Hopkins and every other single American who has ever been diagnosed or  will ever be diagnosed with a disease  like cancer that they’re on their own  when it comes to coverage, that sure  they’re  free  to get  treatments and  meet with their doctors, undergo laborious and  life-saving  surgeries year  after year, just so long as they can foot  the bill or try to keep it under the annual cap, because when  it comes to  cancer,  budgeting  your  treatment  should  surely  take precedence over  anything else. Right?  Mr. GARAMENDI, I am ashamed that  we are considering repeal of this affordable health care bill; and when I  see these numbers about $250,000 and I  think of the fact that the Republicans  were against any caps on taxes, they  realize $250,000 annual income in many  places is a middle-income salary, but  for  limitations on health care, they  think the  insurance company should  determine that and that’s enough; and  if you have got cancer, it’s not enough.  Another friend of mine Facebooked  me, Jimmy Barrasso. Jimmy worked  for a long time for a company in Memphis. He’s always been successful. He  lost his job with that corporation. Because he had high cholesterol, he had  difficulties getting  insurance, and  it  took him a long time to find private insurance because of that pre-existing  condition. He  just  sent me  this on  Facebook. He was friending me and he  mentioned it, and I wanted to relate it.  There are so many people  in this  country who are getting benefits and  will get benefits and many of the benefits don’t go into effect until 2014, and  the idea that this Congress, the 112th,  as its first act would do such harm to  the general welfare of the American  public is hard to fathom.  b1600  ",2011
66,36,2011-01-06,Mr. GARAMENDI.," Mr. COHEN, thank  you so very much. Your closing sentence needs to be repeated. That the  very first piece of legislation taken up  by the new Republican majority in the  112th Congress is to repeal the Patients  Bill of Rights. It’s unfathomable.  Let me now call on FRANKPALLONE,  our colleague from the great State of—  yes, it is—New Jersey.  ",2011
67,36,2011-01-06,Mr. PALLONE.," Well, first of all, let  me thank you, my colleague from California, and each of the other speakers  here  for the contribution they have  made tonight, and particularly when I  listened to my colleague  from Tennessee  talk  about  those  particular  cases  of  individuals  that were  impacted, because that’s really what this  is all about.  Again, it is amazing to me that the  first act of this new Republican majority is to try to repeal a bill, health care  reform, that really is making a difference for people on a personal level,  particularly with the patient protections.  You know, I thought to myself when  I was coming down here: Who benefits  from repeal? Who could possibly benefit from repeal? Because, as many of  you talked about, all the people who  are going to be harmed by  it, who  would benefit from it? And the only  group I could think of that would benefit from the repeal are the big insurance companies because, if you think  about it, what do they want to do?  They want  to keep  increasing premiums. I read that in your State—I  don’t know, you may have already  mentioned it—Blue Cross/Blue Shield,  whatever, is talking about a 50-something percent increase. I cannot fathom these double-digit increases.  And, of course, as this health care reform kicks in, it’s going to be more and  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:46 Aug 19, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\H06JA1.REC H06JA1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

69,44,2011-01-06,Mr. YARMUTH.,"  You know, as I listened to this discussion, I thought, I wonder what taxpayers are thinking about with this  discussion. I wonder about those taxpayers who go to work every day but  who, through no  fault of their own,  can’t afford to buy health insurance  even though they work every day and  they pay taxes every day.  I thought, well, under the Affordable  Care Act, indeed, for those people, we  get to, you know, put a little bottom  under them so they can be covered, so  they can, you know, go to work and  take care of their families and can also  have the security of knowing that their  families are going to be covered with  health care.  I thought about the discussion earlier on this floor where our colleagues  on the other side of the aisle talked,  you know, somewhat disparagingly of  the young people who maybe finish college or trade school and go to get jobs,  but there is a gap in health care coverage because they’ve turned 22 or 23  years old. They’re working for a living,  doing what they need to do. They’ve  gone to school. They’ve gotten trades,  maybe, and they can’t afford health  care coverage. So their parents get to  say, You know what? For all of our  peace of mind and for your security,  we’re going to, you know, pay for that  health care coverage under our plan.  Mr. Speaker, as I stand here today, I  think about my son, who has just gotten a job. There was this period, and I  remember when I received that notice  from our health  insurance company.  That notice, you know, was a shocker  to me because it basically said, You’re  done.  Had we not had this provision in the  Affordable Care Act that enables parents like me and other parents around  the country to have the peace of mind  of being able to keep our children, our  young people, our young working people on our health care plans, I don’t  know what working families would do  out there.  Mr. Speaker, I thought also about a  conversation that I’m going to share  with you, a conversation with some  seniors that I had, as I was spending  New Year’s Eve with friends. One of the  seniors said to me, as we were talking  about health care, You know, I have a  medical condition. I’m spending thousands of dollars, and I’ve fallen into the  doughnut hole, and it is really taking a  chunk out of our pocket.  I had the privilege on December 31 of  saying to this family, Do you know  that, as of January 1, as of the next  day,  in 2011, your prescription drug  that has fallen into that doughnut hole  will actually receive a 50 percent discount?  b1710  They had no idea. I was glad to be  able to share it with them. They’re not  my constituents. They live in somebody else’s State, but it’s great to be  able to share that with them. And  that’s the experience many of our seniors all across the country are having  right now as they realize that they  won’t have to bear the burden of out-  of-pocket costs for prescription drugs  that fall through a doughnut hole because they can’t afford  it anymore.  Their young people will be able to be  covered until they’re 26. If you experience domestic violence in a handful of  States, that’s a preexisting condition.  Guess what? Insurance companies will  no longer, as we move into the implementation of our health care reform  bill, be able to call that a preexisting  condition.  And so I will close and allow you  some additional opportunity  in your  time, but I do want to say that it was  really compelling to read the Constitution here on the floor of the House of  Representatives  today, and again, a  very important reminder of our obligation as elected officials to look out for  the general welfare of the people, and I  can think of no better way to do that  than making sure that we protect the  health insurance, the health care that  Americans have been guaranteed because of what we were able to accomplish with the Affordable Care Act.  ",2011
70,44,2011-01-06,Mr. YARMUTH.," I thank the distinguished Congresswoman  from Maryland for her comments, and I’m actually kind of glad that Congressman  KINGbrought up these major benefits  which are now helping families across  this country.  Ms. EDWARDS talked about the benefit of adding your son or daughter  under 26 to your policy, and Mr. KING  basically  pooh-poohed  that—I  don’t  know if that’s exactly a good legislative term, but kind of ridiculed that.  And then he talked about lifetime limits and how lifetime limits were not  necessarily something that we should  worry about in spite of the fact that almost a million Americans a year, historically, over the last few years, have  gone bankrupt because they either had  no insurance or their insurance was inadequate and they lost everything they  had because of health care costs, because of a cancer diagnosis or serious  accident. These are real-life stories.  These are not abstractions.  And I understand that we have many  colleagues on the other side of the aisle  who believe, with almost a religious  zeal, in certain things like the perfection of the marketplace, in spite of the  fact that we’ve seen time after time  after time in this country, not too long  ago with the financial system, how our  markets often fail, how we have created or allowed to be created enormous  sources of power and concentrations of  economic power in this country that  have basically distorted the marketplaces, and that is very, very true in  the area of health insurance.

73,52,2011-01-06,Mr. PERLMUTTER.," Well, I’d say to  my friend from North Carolina that he  was talking about the fact that seniors  will see this doughnut hole, their prescription drug prices go back up, the  costs go back up; but even, I think,  more worrisome than that is the fact  that, under the Affordable Care Act,  those same seniors receive $250.  In my district in Colorado, the suburbs of Denver, 31,000 seniors received  this past fall $250 in assistance to payments of their prescription drugs. Even  with that, we still save the $230 billion  that you were talking about. Yet, when  the Republicans repeal this in kind of  an ‘‘all or nothing’’ situation, do those  seniors have to pay that $250 back,  each of them? I don’t know. I think  they ought to be worried about that,  and that’s why this is such an extreme  measure.  They are taking away freedoms that  belong to the people, that belong to  Americans. They are doing it in a radical and ideological way. When they  said during the campaign, you know,  Let’s put people back to work, and let’s  not spend too much money, they’re  spending more. They’re taking away  freedoms, and  I am concerned  that  those seniors are going to have to pay  that $250 back, per senior. The seniors  should be concerned as well.  This is a radical act, Mr. Speaker and  ",2011
74,52,2011-01-06,Mr. PRICE.," We have got to fight it. I  hate fighting these battles right out of  the box, but if they’re going to take  these kinds of radical positions, we  have no choice.  With that, I would yield to my friend  from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER).  ",2011
75,52,2011-01-06,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Thank you. I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy for  permitting me to speak just as I appreciate my  colleagues  coming  to  the  floor to spotlight something that each  and every American needs to be deeply  concerned about.  I listened, for example, for the last 4  years, as a member of the Budget Committee, to my dear friend and colleague  Mr. RYANtalk about the skyrocketing  problem  of  escalating  entitlement  under  Medicare.  Absolutely  right.  There are 79 million of the geezer baby  boomers like me who are going to start  collecting Medicare—10,000 a day starting this week and continuing  for 19  years—and because of the development  of more improvements in health care,  not only are there more of us, but we  are going to want more complex and  expensive care.  My Republican friends were talking  about an entitlement crisis. The irony  was—and we all heard it on the campaign trail—they talked about slashing  Medicare, which they want to repeal  starting next week. A great deal of  irony.  As  the  independent  scorekeeper—the Congressional Budget Office—has pointed out and as you have  repeated on the House floor, the legislation will, in fact, save several hundred billion dollars. More  important  than that, it puts in place reforms that  will further reduce entitlement spending.  I know my good friend from Vermont  is well familiar with the Dartmouth  Atlas in dealing with health care disparities around the country. I come  from a part of the country where one of  the problems we have is that Medicare  needs to be reformed, which is what we  started in this legislation. They’re relatively modest steps, but they’re going  to save a couple hundred billion dollars. We need to do more. Rather than  repealing these reforms, like stopping  unnecessary hospital  re-admissions—  just that item costs over $12 billion a  year—these reforms could enable us to  bend the cost curve. If everybody practiced medicine the way it’s practiced in  metropolitan Portland, Oregon, which  is half the price of McAllen, Texas, or  Miami, Florida, there wouldn’t be an  entitlement crisis for decades to come.  I appreciate my colleagues focusing  on the hypocrisy and on the recklessness of trying to repeal health care reform that makes a difference  for 32  million uninsured Americans and that  provides more benefit for the seniors  with their prescription drugs. Most important and under-appreciated is that  it would reform Medicare so that, instead of driving us off a cliff over the  next 20 years, it would, in fact, help us  change how medicine is practiced to  provide incentives for value, medical  value, rather than just volume.  ",2011
76,52,2011-01-06,Mr. WELCH.," Thank you, the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have?  ",2011
77,52,2011-01-06,The SPEAKER pro tempore., The gentleman has 3 minutes remaining.  ,2011
78,52,2011-01-06,Mr. WELCH.," All right. Let me just  ask the gentleman from North Carolina, Would you like to make any closing remarks and then yield to the gentleman from Colorado?  Mr. PRICE  of North Carolina.  thank the gentleman.  I would like to just underscore what  our colleague  from Oregon has  just  said.  There  is  so much  concern,  obviously—and for good reason—about the  future of Medicare. The most conservative estimate  I have  seen  is  that  I  health care reform extends the fiscal  solvency of Medicare by 8 years, and  some estimates are much more than  that. So to simply throw that overboard as well as to talk about this  doughnut hole—these thousands of dollars that senior citizens are paying full  freight on for medicines they simply  must have—and this gap in coverage is  ridiculous, and we are finally fixing it.  What  insurance policy do any of us  know about that would have that kind  of gap in coverage?  As the gentleman from Colorado said,  $250 payments  this year.  I mean,  I  guess this raises the question as to  whether  even  that might be  taken  back; but in future years, we are going  to close that doughnut hole, and we are  going to extend the solvency of Medicare. Anybody  concerned about  the  health care for this country’s senior  citizens simply has to be very, very  alarmed about what is going on in this  House right now.  ",2011
79,52,2011-01-06,Mr. WELCH.," Thank you, the gentleman from North Carolina.  I yield for the final word from the  gentleman from Colorado.  ",2011
80,52,2011-01-06,Mr. PERLMUTTER.," Sure. I appreciate my friends.  You know, instead of amending or repairing, as Mr. PRICE from North Carolina described it, they want to repeal,  just take it away.  Well, they’re taking away freedoms.  They’re taking away the freedom from  discrimination for prior illnesses, like  my daughter with epilepsy,  like the  daughter who had Crohn’s disease, or  the friend at the gas station. It’s taking away the freedom from cancellation because you get sick, you know,  and lose your insurance. You know, it’s  taking away the freedom to move jobs  so you’re not stuck in a job, so you can  move jobs and not fear losing your insurance. I mean, they’re taking away a  lot—and maybe this $250 that went to  the seniors. It is a radical move to take  these freedoms away, and I hope they  think twice and don’t vote to repeal.  With that, I would yield back to my  friend from Vermont for his final remarks.  ",2011
81,52,2011-01-06,Mr. WELCH.," Well, I thank my colleagues for being here.  The bottom line is, anytime we pass  a major piece of legislation, we should  have the humility to acknowledge it  can be improved—and we all do. We can  make it better. We can make it stronger. But this totally destroys things  that we have been fighting for decades  to achieve on behalf of the American  people: help for seniors with their prescription drugs, extending the financial  viability of Medicare, changing and encouraging a new way of delivering  health care services, moving away from  fee-for-service, volume-driven  to patient-centered,  performance-based  care, and then insurance reforms that  put the patients in charge, which acknowledge that we are all  in  it together. This takes away the absolute  unilateral power of for-profit insurance  companies  to  decide whether  your  daughter or mine has health care.

82,60,2011-01-06,Mr. QUIGLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  remember a Chicago hero. On Dec. 23, firefighter Corey Ankum tragically lost his life in  the  line of duty when  the  roof of a South  Shore building collapsed. Corey was just 34  years old.  A former member of the Chicago Police Department, Corey had been a firefighter for just  18 months. He left the Police force to follow in  the  footsteps of his close  relative, Gerald  Glover,  a  veteran  firefighter. Gerald, who  rushed to the scene of the burning building in  South Shore, remembered Corey as someone  who ‘‘loved helping people.’’  Whether it was battling the flames of a burning building or helping to keep neighborhoods  safe, Corey spent his life serving Chicago and  protecting Chicagoans. His selflessness will  live on through his memory, and the lives of  his surviving wife and children.  I join the rest of Chicago in mourning the  loss of one of our own. The city Corey gave  his life to protect will never forget him.  May he rest in peace.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF DR.  BHUPENDRA PATEL  HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 2011  ",2011
83,60,2011-01-06,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge  the achievements of Bhupendra  Patel, M.D., a remarkable man who has dedicated himself in service to others. The Chief of  the Department of Medicine at the Mount Sinai  Hospital in Queens, Dr. Patel is also an important and inspirational voice for the thriving Indian-American  community  of  our  nation’s  greatest city. A selfless advocate for his patients as well as a dedicated and generous  philanthropist, ‘‘Bhupi’’ Patel is truly an example and role model for the community, and I  am proud to call him my friend.  Dr. Bhupendra Patel has demonstrated a  lifelong passion for the study and practice of  medicine. Born  and  raised  in Kenya,  he  earned an MBBS  from Baroda Medical College in India. The political unrest there, coupled with immigration of many of his friends to  the United States, inspired Dr. Patel to conduct his medical internship and residency at  the Long  Island Jewish Hospital, where he  worked as an internist. Dr. Patel continued to  make  important contributions  to  the  field of  medical education by serving as an Assistant  Clinical Professor of Medicine at the renowned  Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.  Throughout his career, Dr. Patel has striven  successfully  to help serve  the needs of  the  growing Asian-American community  in New  York City, serving as  the President of  the  Gujarati Samaj of Greater New York and helping found the Nargis Dutt Memorial Foundation. As President of  the Gujarati Samaj,  Bhupendra Patel helped  raise money  for a  new  community  center  to  serve  the  local  Gujarati community. The Nargis Dutt Foundation that he helped found has committed itself  to improving medical care for cancer patients  throughout  India  for  the past decade, supplying critically needed medical equipment to  healthcare  facilities  there. Dr.  Patel  also  serves  on  the  board  of  ‘‘SHAREing  and  CAREing,’’ an organization in Queens that for  the last sixteen years has provided essential  services to those afflicted with breast cancer,  helping to ensure the quality of their medical  and social services and providing  them with  critical tools to help them in their moment of  need.  Dr. Patel’s activism extends beyond  the  world of medicine. As President of the Indian-  American Center  for Political Awareness, he  has worked not only to improve bilateral relations between  India and America, but  to  increase political awareness of and boost  the  participation of  the  Indian American community. In so doing, he has helped pave the way  for second generation Americans of Indian descent, urging  them  to  remain  involved and  build on earlier progress. Dr. Patel’s considerable  contributions  to medicine and philanthropy have been widely acknowledged; he  has been honored by the Gujarati Samaj of  Greater New York, the Indian Dental Association of the United States, and 100 Black Men,  and was presented  the  ‘‘Outstanding Asian  American’’ award by  former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, as well as the prestigious  2008 Ellis Island Medal of Honor.  Mr. Speaker, in recognition of a lifetime of  service to others, I request that my colleagues  join me  in paying  tribute  to Dr. Bhupendra  ‘‘Bhupi’’ Patel, a great New Yorker and a great  American who made  immeasurable  improvements to the quality of life of his fellow New  Yorkers. Dr. Patel’s  selfless and enduring  dedication to serving others and to the civic  life of our nation serves as an inspiration to us  all.  f  HONORING STATE SENATOR DAVE  ARONBERG  HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 2011  ",2011
84,60,2011-01-06,Mr. DEUTCH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  honor of a dedicated public servant,  fierce  consumer advocate, and my dear friend, State  Senator Dave Aronberg.  A native of Miami, Dave attended Harvard  College and Harvard Law School. Shortly after  graduation, Dave began his work with the office of the State Insurance Commissioner taking on  foreign  insurance companies  that refused  to honor World War  II era policies  issued to victims of the Holocaust.  Dave’s passion for public service next took  him  to  the office of  the Attorney General,  where he became an Assistant Attorney General. It was in this capacity that Dave was responsible for prosecuting consumer fraud and  led the lawsuits against ‘‘Miss Cleo’s’’ fraudulent business holdings.  In 2000, Dave was chosen to participate in  the prestigious White House Fellows program  as a Special Assistant to the Secretary of the  Treasury  for  international money  laundering.  During his  fellowship, Dave represented  the  Treasury Department at a global summit on  money laundering and the laundering of terrorist assets in Malaysia. He then traveled as  part of an official White House delegation to  meet with foreign officials and to visit refugee  camps in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.  After his fellowship, Dave returned to South  Florida and in 2002 was elected to represent  the 27th District of Florida in the State Senate.  During his 8 years in the Senate, Dave continued his advocacy for strong consumer protections, was a member of Florida’s Medicaid  task force, and led the fight that successfully  secured  federal  funding  for  the Everglades  Restoration Project.

85,68,2011-01-06,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  recognize Community Regional Medical Center on the occasion of the grand opening of  Terry’s House, a new, state-of-the-art facility in  downtown Fresno, California, which will provide much needed support and housing  to  allow families to stay close to sick and injured  loved ones  in  the hospital. Located  in  the  heart of the Fresno medical district, this new  15,874  square-foot,  two-story  family house  with twenty guest suites will be the first hospitality house in the Greater Fresno Area.  This residential facility is named in honor of  Terry Richards who suffered and survived a  serious trauma at the age of five when he was  injured  in a  car accident. For nearly  five  months, his mother was forced to travel nearly  80 miles a day to see her son while he was  recovering  in  the hospital. Currently,  family  members of patients must seek accommodations miles from the hospital, and many who  cannot afford lodging sleep in waiting rooms,  in their cars or try their best to find a spot in  a busy hospital. Often, patients’  loved ones  have no alternative but to leave the hospital  and make the long drive home. Now families  have Terry’s House,  their home away  from  home, while their loved ones receive care.  Terry’s House was made possible by  the  tireless work of Terry Richards’ brother, Tom  Richards, a  local community developer and  CEO of the Penstar Group. With the dedication of Tom Richards, Leta Ciavaglia, the Terry’s House Development Council, the Community Regional Medical Center Foundation and  many generous members of the community, a  family dream has become a reality.  Mr. Speaker, I applaud Terry’s House and  its many supporters for their efforts to create  a facility which keeps families together during  times of need. I ask my colleagues to join me  in commending Tom Richards and the community members of Fresno who have worked  unremittingly to make the opening of Terry’s  House possible.  f  THE  WALK  FOR  HEALTHCARE:  HEALTHCARE STORIES FROM ILLINOIS  AND  INDIANA  COLLECTED BY OGAN GUREL, M.D.  HON.

86,68,2011-01-06,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker,  I submit  the  following stories, collected by Dr. Ogan Gurel.  ‘‘Martha finds it shameful that America  can’t provide basic health care for its citizens, like any other developed country does.  ‘Civilized nations care for those in need,’ she  said. She especially noted that the connection of health care insurance to employment  status was a big problem. ‘It doesn’t make  sense. If you get sick, you have a greater  chance of being unemployed.’’’ Martha—Chicago, 6/27/2009  ‘‘Addison, on the right, is Martha’s older  son. He’s a student in college who, with evident pride, told me that in the past election  he had just voted for the first time. As he  embarks on study abroad in Italy this coming fall, he is, despite his glowing patriotism,  embarrassed that health care for all, as he  has learned is the case in Italy, doesn’t exist  here in America.’’ Addison—Chicago, 6/27/2009  ‘‘I met Ron along Martin Luther King  Drive. He was working at painting a fence.  He waved his hand towards the south side  streets beyond and said, ‘Yes, there’s many  people here without health insurance.’ With  a serious look, he turned back towards me.  ‘Yes, without health care.’ He shared a story  of an old lady from the neighborhood. She  had a change in coverage that now made it  too expensive to get her insulin for her diabetes. ‘It was all very fishy business,’ Ron  told me. This lady, on Medicare, was in the  hospital for some time. An insurance salesman came to her hospital bed and convinced  her to change her coverage (Ron couldn’t recall the exact name but he told me it sounded, ‘Something like Well Care’). What happened was that this ‘new’ plan didn’t cover  the old lady’s particular type of insulin so,  with her  ‘brand-new’ private supplemental  insurance plan in place, she ended up now  spending $129 a month, out-of-pocket, for her  medication. The insurance salesman is gone  and now she’s struggling, Ron tells me, on  top of her fight to stay well, to piece together her wrecked insurance and financial  situation.’’ Ron—Chicago, 6/27/2009  ‘‘Stopping by the Chicago Baptist Institute, I met Rev. Joseph Felker, the Chairman of that organization. A crowd was gathered and  they were hosting an outdoor  event—a ‘Healthy Walk’ event actually. He  told me, ‘We should have had health care for  the uninsured years ago. It is a travesty, a  true travesty, but hopefully the change we  are seeing is a start.’’’ Joseph—Chicago, 6/27/  2009  ‘‘Sitting next to Rev. Felker was Rev. Dr.  Tyler.

87,76,2011-01-06,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution introduced by my good  friend and colleague, Minority Whip STENY  HOYERof Maryland that would restore the voting  rights  for  the Delegates and Resident  Commissioner during Committee of the Whole  proceedings during the 112th Congress.  As  I stated yesterday,  the  rules  for  the  112th Congress  leave  this body  less  transparent and less responsive to our constituents.  Eliminating  the  right  for Delegates and  the  Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole deprives our constituents  with  the understanding of how we stand on  important issues. The fact that our vote in the  Committee of the Whole is symbolic is further  evidence of why such a right does not diminish the role of other Members of the House of  Representatives; in fact, allowing us the right  to a symbolic vote enhances  long-cherished  values of this body.  Moreover, affording us the right to vote in  the Committee of the Whole ensures that equities of our constituents are covered in legislation that is pending or being debated by this  body. In June 2009 the House of Representatives debated and voted on H.R. 2346,  the  Supplemental Appropriations Act  for Fiscal  Year 2009. The bill contained language that  allowed the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay to any of the territories and it did  not provide the Governor of each respective  territory with  the right  to be notified of any  such transfer. Our right to vote in the Committee of  the Whole afforded us  the opportunity  to  raise  this matter before  the entire  body and  subsequent  legislation  that  contained such transfer prohibition language did  expressly include the territories. Our right to  vote in the Committee of the Whole afforded  us all the ability to represent the interests of  our respective territories. Our voice was heard  and changes were made.  Many men and women  in uniform come  from the territories and the District of Columbia. Many have sacrificed for our country, and,  in  fact,  the per capita  rate of deaths  for  servicemembers from the territories is higher  than most states. Yet despite  the patriotism  and service that men and women from the territories show, the new leadership of the House  of Representatives saw it fit to take away one  of our most basic rights—the right to vote and  effectively represent the needs of our constituents.  I also enter into the RECORD letters the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner sent  to the leaders requesting an opportunity to address this rules change prior to the convening  of the 112th Congress. Regrettably, the opportunity  to address  this matter prior  to yesterday’s convening was not presented. Therefore, and based on the action taken yesterday,  I stand in support of the resolution introduced  today by Mr. HOYERand hope that it will be  brought to the floor for a vote in the near future.  CONGRESSOFTHEUNITEDSTATES,  DEAR SPEAKER-DESIGNATE Washington, DC, December 22, 2010.  Hon. JOHNA. BOEHNER,  Speaker-designate, House  of Representatives,  The Capitol, Washington, DC.  BOEHNER: Now  that a summary of proposed Rules for the  112th Congress  is circulating and we  find  that the rule enabling the Delegates and  Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole is slated for elimination,  we write to express our concern and renew  our request for a meeting with you to discuss  this matter prior to January 5, 2011.  You will no doubt recall that we wrote last  month to urge retention of this rule. We reiterate  that  this  symbolic exercise of our  country’s democratic principles has great  meaning to our more than four million constituents, who fight and die alongside their  fellow Americans residing in the 50 States to  secure the right to vote for people residing in  such distant lands as Iraq and Afghanistan.  While this issue has been viewed through a  partisan lens in the past, largely because  none of us is a member of the Republican  Conference, we respectfully submit that this  fact should not be used to preclude us front  exercising this most fundamental function of  representative  democracies,  especially  through a procedure which by its design can  never be determinative of any vote.  Therefore, we ask that you retain this existing rule in the Rules package your Conference is preparing for adoption on opening  day of the 112th Congress. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. We  look forward to continuing to work with you  on behalf of our constituents, your fellow  Americans residing in the U.S. territories.

Hon. JOHNA. BOEHNER,  Speaker-designate, House  of Representatives,  The Capitol, Washington, DC.  DEARSPEAKER-DESIGNATEBOEHNER: As the  Republican Conference prepares its package  of proposed House Rules for consideration on  the opening day of the 112th Congress, we respectfully urge you to retain the rule that  enables the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote when the House resolves  into the Committee of the Whole, and that  provides for an automatic revote in the full  House when the votes of the Delegates or the  Resident Commissioner are decisive.  This rule has been found to pass constitutional muster by the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the District of Columbia. See Michel v.  Anderson, 14 F.3d 623 (D.C. Cir. 1994). It has  not impeded the work of the House during  the three Congresses in which it has been in  place:  the  103rd Congress  (1993–1994),  the  110th Congress (2007–2008), and the current  111th Congress (2010–2011), The rule has been  carefully crafted to allow the Majority to decide when it is appropriate for legislation to  be considered in the Committee of the Whole  and, more specifically, to be subject to delegate voting. Therefore, if the Majority determines that a particular bill is better considered without delegate voting, the Rules Committee can report a rule that provides for  voting to be structured accordingly—as occurred in several instances during the 110th  and 111th Congresses. We deeply appreciate  that your Conference did not seek to repeal  or otherwise alter this rule when the Ranking Republican Member of the Rules Committee offered his Motion to Commit with  instructions at the start of the 111th Congress. We hope that your proposed Rules  package for the 112th Congress will be consistent with that prior position.  There are compelling reasons to retain the  rule. First, we know that your Conference,  like our Caucus, values and seeks to promote  open and transparent government. Our constituents can more effectively hold us accountable if there is a record of how we vote  on legislation considered by the House. Although we recognize that the vote conferred  upon us by this rule is essentially symbolic,  it has genuine meaning for those we represent. The rule obligates us to take public  positions on issues of national importance  that will affect the lives of our constituents.  This  enables  our  constituents  to  better  evaluate the quality of our representation.  In addition, we believe this is an issue of  fundamental  fairness with profound moral  implications. Our constituents are part of  the American family. They pledge allegiance  to the same flag and serve alongside their  fellow countrymen  in our nation’s armed  forces. To deprive their duly elected representatives of this small privilege, which  does no harm to this institution, would send  a message of exclusion to Americans living  in the territories and in the District of Columbia. We implore you not to send that  message.  Sincerely,  PEDROR. PIERLUISI.  MADELEINEZ. BORDALLO.  ENIF.H. FALEOMAVAEGA.  DONNAM. CHRISTENSEN.

Edward was killed  in the line of duty on Dec. 23, when the roof  of a burning South Shore building collapsed.  He was 47 years old.  Edward often joked that he was the guy running  into burning buildings when everyone  else was running out. That was the case on  the afternoon of the tragedy that took his life.  Worried  there might be a homeless man or  woman seeking shelter  from  the cold  in  the  abandoned building, his commitment  to  the  Chicagoans  he  swore  to  protect was  far  stronger than any sense of self-preservation.  A 12-year veteran of the Chicago Fire Department, Edward worked out of the firehouse  at 63rd and Dorchester. He was a  lifetime  South Sider, a proud Chicagoan and an American hero. His bravery will never be forgotten  by the city he gave his life to protect.  May Mr. Stringer rest in peace.

There are two ways to go: Put the  government  in charge and have the  government  put  in  place  rationing  mechanisms to tighten the screws and  ration health care; or put the consumer  in charge and have providers compete  for our business as patients, hospitals,  doctors, and insurers. That’s the system we want.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2011
91,6,2011-01-18,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I hope the tenor and  substance of the debate we have in this  House over the next few days will be  worthy of the American people and reflect well on this Congress.  Many of us believe we should focus  our efforts here today on measures to  help put people back to work, rather  than on a bill that takes away important patient and consumer protections.  And we don’t think it makes a whole  lot of  sense  to debate a bill  that,  thankfully, will go nowhere in the Senate and would certainly be vetoed by  the President. However, the Republican  majority  is entitled to use  its time  here as it chooses. And while we believe we should be doing that focused  on jobs, perhaps this debate will clear  up many of the myths and misinformation about the health care law that was  signed by President Obama.  I’m interested to hear my colleagues  say that they can identify with all the  problems  in the health care system.  Between the year 2000 and year 2006,  premiums  in  this  country  doubled,  health  insurance  company  profits  quadrupled, and this Congress did nothing. Why not put your plan on the table  first so everybody can see it before you  begin taking away the important patient protections in this bill taking effect just since last March? And within  that 9-month period, that law has made  an important and positive difference to  millions of Americans.  In fact, we wish our Republican colleagues would take a few days, maybe  even just a few hours, to have congressional hearings to listen to those individuals and families. The new Republican majority said it wanted to listen  to the American people, but it has not  invited a single American outside this  Congress to a hearing to testify on the  repeal bill we are debating today.  As a result, we on the other side of  the aisle have had to schedule an unofficial hearing. It’s going on right now,  not 100 yards from where we debate, in  the Capitol Visitor Center. And I encourage all of you to drop by, because  if you do, you’re going to hear some  stories. You’re going to hear the stories from moms and dads of young people who will tell you how they are relieved that their sons and daughters  are no longer kicked off their insurance policies when they turn age 22 or  graduate from college and cannot now  stay on their parents’ insurance plan  until the age of 26. As a result, if their  20-year-old child gets sick or hit by an  automobile or another terrible accident, they can get care without the  family going bankrupt.  You will hear from moms and dads  with kids who have cancer, asthma, diabetes or other preexisting conditions  telling you they’re relieved that finally  insurance companies can’t deny their  children  coverage  because  of  preexisting conditions. And you will hear  from senior citizens who are unable to  pay for the huge prescription costs of  their bills, and then as of January 1 of  this year, they are getting a 50 percent  discount and they can afford to pay for  the medicines their doctors say they  need.  You will hear from small businesses.  The number of small businesses using  the tax credit has exceeded everyone’s  expectation. You will hear from those  small businesses saying they can now  afford to purchase affordable coverage  for their employees and, as a result,  hire more people. You would hear all  that and more.  That is why it is such a mistake, it’s  an historic mistake,  to  take away  these patient protections and throw  these  individuals back over  to  the  whims and the many abuses of the insurance  industry. There’s no  doubt  that the  insurance  industry will be  popping  champagne  bottles  if  the  health care  law was ever to be repealed. Let’s put the interests of our  constituents, patients and consumers  first in this debate.  ",2011

93,6,2011-01-18,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," I yield myself an  additional 30 seconds.  And let’s make sure that as we do  this, we tackle the deficit and the debt.  I listened to my colleague talk about  the debt, but we all know that the  independent,  nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office  in a  letter  to  Speaker BOEHNER dated January  6,  2011, indicated that repealing this bill  will increase the deficit by over $200  billion over the first 10 years and by  another $1.2 trillion over the second 10  years.  b1510  Our colleagues have criticized those  findings, but they’re the same people  who they applauded when the numbers  came back their way.

95,6,2011-01-18,Mr. CALVERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in support of H.R. 2, a bill that  would  repeal  the disastrous government takeover of health care.  The more we learn about the new  health care law, the more we understand how devastating it will be to our  economy. Already employers across the  country  have  suffered  increases  in  their health premiums as a result of  the health care law, yet we were told  that the  law would bend the health  cost curve downward.  We were told that the bill would reduce the deficit by $143 billion over 10  years. However, we now know that the  figures given to the CBO did not accurately  reflect  the  law’s  real  costs.  When you add back the $115 billion  needed to implement the law and subtract the bill’s double-counting of revenue and other budgetary gimmicks,  the true cost is a staggering $700 billion over 10 years.  We were told the bill would protect  the uninsured; yet all it does is roll  them onto Medicaid—a low-performing  program that has resulted in more people turning to the ER for their medical  needs.

98,14,2011-01-18,Mr. DANIEL E.," LUNGREN of California. Mr. Speaker, in the scope of the  American  constitutional  system  of  governance, the Congress is the body  whose power is defined within the context of enumerated powers, and this is  more than a matter of structural mechanics because it goes to the heart of  the issue of governmental power, or if  one prefers the flip side of the coin,  personal freedom and responsibility.  If government has the power to require that you buy item A, it means  that you are less able to buy item B, C,  D or anything else.  Now, economists would call this the  opportunity cost of foregone goods or  services, but the fundamental question  is the question of freedom to choose  how we as individuals will spend the  fruits of our labor.  Certainly the commerce clause lacks  the elasticity that would accommodate  a  requirement  that every American  buy health insurance which conforms  to the dictates of the Federal Government,  as  the  Federal Government  would change it on a yearly basis. Such  an interpretation would render the notion articulated by James Madison and  Federalist 45, that is, one of limited  government, a nullity.  Now, I know we have smart people  here. I know we have those in the administration who believe that this is  totally  constitutional;  but,  frankly,  Mr. Speaker, my bet goes with James  Madison.  He did say that the powers delegated  by the proposed Constitution of the  Federal Government are few and defined. He did say that the Federal Government will be exercising their responsibilities principally on external  objects as war, peace, negotiations, and  foreign commerce and the States would  do much else.  Then, of course, we have the 10th  Amendment, later adopted, which said,  again, that this is a government of limited enumerated powers. Now, either  the 10th Amendment means something,  or it means nothing; and either James  Madison knew what he was talking  about, or he does not.  ",2011

I have  heard from many of my constituents  and  small business owners who are  grateful for the benefits of this law.  Children with preexisting conditions  are no longer being denied access to  private  health  insurance. Maryland  small businesses offering health insurance to their employees are eligible for  a 35 percent tax credit.  Further, as ranking member of the  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,  I note that repealing  this law would also eliminate the new  private health plan currently providing  coverage  for many uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions.  I find it repugnant that Republicans  want to strip Americans of this law’s  protections that will save the lives of  our fellow citizens.  I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill.  ",2011

103,22,2011-01-18,Mr. CICILLINE.," I thank the gentlelady for yielding.  Madam Speaker,  I  rise  strong opposition to H.R. 2.  We know that if we repeal this law,  we know the following things will happen: Children with preexisting conditions will be denied coverage; adult  children under the age of 26 will be denied coverage under their parents’ policy; seniors will pay more for their prescription drugs; and small businesses  will once again go back to paying nearly 20 percent more than their corporate  counterparts  for providing the same  health care coverage; small businesses  would lose the incentive for providing  coverage to their employees and an up  to 50 percent tax credit which has already  increased  coverage  at  small  firms by more than 10 percent. They  would lose the ability to grow their  businesses and create  jobs by using  that tax credit to hire additional employees.  This law establishes consumer protections,  incentivizes wellness  programs, and establishes cost controls  and cost-cutting exchanges. For small  businesses, that means driving down  the cost of providing health insurance  and providing assistance for small businesses that are struggling with skyrocketing premiums.  Currently, small businesses pay, on  average, 18 percent more than  large  businesses for the same coverage, and  health insurance premiums have gone  up three times faster than wages in the  past 10 years.

107,22,2011-01-18,Mr. FLEISCHMANN.," Madam Speaker, tonight I rise in support of the repeal of ObamaCare.  This is my first speech on the floor as  a Member of Congress, and I thought it  only appropriate that  it be on this  topic—a topic I campaigned hard on  and a topic I believe strongly in.  We must repeal this health care legislation. As a small business owner for  the past 24 years, I know firsthand the  kind of damage this legislation would  do to American small business if it is  allowed to be put in place.  The National Federation  of  Independent  Research  Foundation  conducted a study that showed the employer mandate  found  in ObamaCare  could lead to a loss of 1.6 million jobs  throughout the country, and 66 percent  of those lost jobs would come from the  small business workforce. That same  study showed ‘‘small businesses would  lose, roughly, $113 billion in real output and account for 56 percent of all  real output lost.’’  As a member of the Small Business  Committee, I promise to use my personal experience to fight every day for  small  business  owners  everywhere.  Starting  tonight,  we must  repeal  ObamaCare.  Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. MILLER).  Mr. MILLER  of North  Carolina.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak  against this bill.  Even before the recession, my State  of North Carolina was losing one wave  of jobs after another in our traditional  industries, and we have needed the energy and the job creation that comes  from small business—from people leaving  jobs, whether they  jump or are  pushed, and starting their own businesses. Half the American economy,  our gross domestic product,  is generated by small business. Even more  importantly, small businesses create 75  percent of new jobs.  By providing access to State high-  risk pools and an insurance market for  individuals, the health care reform bill  passed last year will make it possible  for American workers to start their  own businesses without worrying they  are going to lose health care for themselves or for their families.  I do know firsthand what it is like as  a small business owner to buy health  insurance for employees. It is one of  the  greatest  frustrations—trying  to  find something affordable and trying to  figure out what you really bought, and  you’re not going to know until one of  your employees gets sick or gets hurt.  This bill, the bill passed last year—  this legislation—will make it affordable. It will provide tax credits of 35  percent for small businesses to provide  health insurance, and that is going to  go up to 50 percent. That will increase  health care coverage by more than 12  percent amongst small business owners. Even more  importantly, they’re  going to know what they’ve got. It is  going to be insurance that really covers what it ought to cover. It is not  going to be filled with small-print exceptions of one kind of care after another, one condition after another. Employees are going to get the care they  need.  Reform has freed people who want to  start a business to do it without worrying about what kind of shape  it’s  going to leave them in and their family  members in.  I urge my colleagues to vote against  this bill, which will put those small  businesses back into uncertain land.  ",2011
108,22,2011-01-18,Mr. GRAVES of Missouri.," Madam  Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute  to another member of the Small Business  Committee,  the  gentlewoman  from  Washington  (Ms.  HERRERA  BEUTLER).  ",2011
109,22,2011-01-18,Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER.," Madam  Speaker, I rise in support of this bill,  and I hope this is only a first step in  the pursuit of making quality, affordable health care available to all Americans.  This year we have the chance to correct mistakes made by both parties.  The ObamaCare bill passed by  the  other party last year was the wrong approach. It increases the debt and the  deficit  for  future generations while  doing nothing to decrease the  inflationary curve of health care. It was the  wrong approach.  No party is perfect. The last time our  party had the majority, while there  were many on our side of the aisle who  worked  diligently  to  reform health  care, the job was left undone. Getting  this right is one of the reasons the people of southwest Washington sent me  to Congress. Now, the good news is that  solutions exist that can fix our health  care system and bring costs down for  middle-income families. Today, we hit  ‘‘reset’’ on health care reform.  I invite my Democratic colleagues to  join me  in advancing solutions that  help small businesses and middle-income  families—solutions  like  small  business health plans, ending junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of everyone’s care, the expanded use of health  savings accounts, and the ability to  purchase  health  care  across  State  lines.  These are patient-centered solutions  that won’t grow government, but are  solutions that will make health care  more affordable and more accessible to  all Americans. I sincerely hope we vote  today to seize this chance.  Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I  would like to inquire as to how much  time remains on both sides.  ",2011

112,30,2011-01-18,Mr. JONES.," Mr. Speaker, today I had  the honor and privilege of visiting the  wounded warriors at Bethesda Naval  Hospital. Each one of the young men I  saw, the oldest being 23, is very special,  as are all of our men and women in uniform.  The medical staff at both Bethesda  and Walter Reed  is  truly amazing.  They have done a wonderful job repairing the broken bodies and spirits of our  young servicemembers.  The number of wounded warriors returning  from war has become more  prevalent with the  increased use of  IEDs by the enemy. More and more of  our young men and women are returning without their arms and legs. Tonight, Mr. Speaker, as a constant reminder of the pain of war, I show you  this picture of a young triple amputee  and his wife. This man gave his body  for this country and will struggle for  the rest of his life. How many more  will have to return home in this condition?  This young man and his wife have  just returned from the hospital. He is  in a wheelchair. He lost an arm and  two legs and he is looking at a beautiful American flag that was on the  wall that had been drawn for him.  It is time we declare victory and get  our troops out of Afghanistan. It is evident that President Karzai does not appreciate our commitment. If he did, he  would not be so corrupt. If he did, he  would not have made the comments  that he now has three main enemies—  the Taliban, the United States and the  international community as stated in  the Washington Post on December 13.  He said that if he had to choose sides  today, he would choose the Taliban.  The Taliban are killing American service men and women.  Mr. Speaker, I have joined DENNIS  KUCINICHas well as many other members of both parties in the hope that  President Obama will keep his promise  to start withdrawing our troops in July  of this year.  b1920  In closing, I would like to urge the  American people to get engaged in this  cause and to let their Members of Congress know how they feel. They must  encourage the Members of Congress to  vote to bring our troops home. The  pain must end, and we can easily declare a victory and bring our brave  men and women home.  Mr. Speaker, as I do all the time on  the floor of the House when I speak, I  ask God to please bless our men and  women in uniform, to bless the families  of our men and women in uniform. I  ask God in his loving arms to hold the  families who have given a child dying  for freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq. I  ask God to please bless the House and  Senate that we will do what is right for  the American people. I ask God to give  strength,  wisdom,  and  courage  to  President Obama that he will do what  is right for the American people. And  three times I will ask God please, God  please, God please continue to bless  America.  f  SMART SECURITY  ",2011

114,30,2011-01-18,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Mr. Speaker, our Nation is now in its 10th straight year of  war. The military occupation of Afghanistan is longer than any war in our  Nation’s history. An entire generation  of young people—including my three  grandchildren who came with me to  visit Washington for the swearing in—  is growing up knowing nothing but a  Nation at war.  This war is not just a moral abomination with devastating human costs,  and it is not just fiscally irresponsible  and unsustainable with a price tag of  about $370 billion, though it most certainly is all of that. Perhaps the most  tragic irony of this war is, for all of the  sacrifice, it is not even doing what it  was supposed to do: keeping us safe and  defeating a terrorist threat.  If Iraq and Afghanistan have proven  anything to us, Mr. Speaker, it is that  we need an entirely new national security model; one that emphasizes brain  over brawn; one that uses soft power  instead  of hard;  one  that  protects  America by relying on the most honorable American values—love of freedom,  desire for peace, moral leadership, and  compassion for the people of the world.

115,38,2011-01-18,Mr. PALLONE.," Thank you. I want to  thank you for all that you do on this  issue. I have seen you come to the floor  so many times over the last year or  more talking about the importance of  the health care reform and now, of  course, pointing out how ridiculous it  is to try to repeal it, which is what the  Republicans are going to try to do tomorrow.  I just want to start out by saying  that we were just home for the Martin  Luther King weekend, and so there was  an opportunity to talk to a lot of people at the various Martin Luther King  events over the 3 or 4 days that we  were home, and the issue is jobs. That’s  all people want to talk about. Everyone comes up to me and says, What are  you going to do about the economy?  What are you going to do about jobs?  Nobody  talks  about  repealing  the  health reform bill.  And what I get basically from my  constituents is they know the health  reform bill passed. They know that it’s  kicking in. A lot of the patients’ protections that you mentioned have already kicked in, and they want to see  how it goes. Even those who were not  necessarily  for  it  in  the beginning  think it is a complete waste of time for  us to be rehashing the debate and talking about repeal because they want to  see what is actually going to happen  with the health care reform. And to the  extent  that  they have  seen certain  things, protections, kick  in,  they’re  happy with it. And what they say to  me is, Look, if over the next few years  if certain aspects don’t work out, then  you can go back and revisit  it and  maybe make some changes. Nobody is  suggesting we can’t make changes on a  bipartisan basis. But this idea of just  repealing it outright when it just went  into effect a few months ago, almost no  one I talked to is in favor of that. They  just don’t think that makes sense.  The other thing that I wanted to say,  and  I keep stressing over and over  again—I actually have this chart, and I  know you pointed to it as well—is: Who  is going to actually gain from the repeal? We know that insurance companies keep raising their prices. We know  that historically they try to discriminate by eliminating people who have  preexisting conditions or by having  lifetime caps on insurance policies. The  only ones that gain from this repeal  are the insurance companies because  essentially they can go back to the situation, to the status quo where they  can  have  double-digit  premium  increases. You know, in your own State  of California, it wasn’t unusual to have  a 30 percent  increase.  I think Blue  Cross just announced a 50-something  percent  increase. And so they make  money by constantly raising premiums  and also by discrimination.  In other words, if you have a policy,  a woman, for example, that has breast  cancer and then she has a recurrence,  well, if she reaches the cap on coverage  for the year or the cap on coverage for  a lifetime, then she has no insurance to  cover her reoccurring cancer.  Or the other thing is that sometimes  they even rescind a policy. If they can  find some way to say that it didn’t  apply to you, they would simply rescind it altogether, and you’d get sick  and wouldn’t have  insurance at all,  even when you thought you had the  greatest need for it.  So I just want to stress, this chart  says GOP patients’ rights repeal would  put  insurance  companies  back  in  charge where children with preexisting  conditions are denied coverage, young  people aged 26 can’t stay on their parents’ plan, pregnant women and breast  and prostate cancer patients could be  thrown off insurance rolls—that’s the  rescission—seniors pay more for their  drugs.  The bill, as you know, has, for those  in the doughnut hole, until this bill  went  into effect,  if you reached the  doughnut hole, then you had to pay 100  percent  for your prescription drugs.  You got a $250 rebate last year. As of  January 1, you have a 50 percent reduction, and that’s going to eventually become zero so you will have complete  coverage under Medicare part D.  So, if you repeal it, seniors are going  to pay more for their drugs. And that’s  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:26 Jan 19, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K18JA7.094 H18JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 B K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2011

I would like to yield now 5 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Texas, Congresswoman SHEILAJACKSONLEE.  ",2011
117,46,2011-01-18,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," I thank  the gentlelady. It is a pleasure to be  able to join my colleagues on the floor,  including  Congressman  MEEKSof New York, who we’ll have the  opportunity to hear from, and I thank  for your continued  leadership, and my colleague on Judiciary Committee, we had  the opportunity  to  contribute  to  the debate  today.  The Judiciary Committee has as its  jurisdiction the Constitution, and our  friends on the other side of the aisle  keep talking about that this is unconstitutional. It baffles me and almost  frustrates me because I’m trying to  grab hold to what the argument is, particularly since we have had Medicare  by the Federal Government since 1965,  and  it has withstood any constitutional challenge, and that was implemented under the Commerce Act.  But frankly, if we have an argument  to make on the Constitution, I will  share with you why this is clearly a  constitutional bill, because we are actually denying people both due process  and equal protection under the  law  under the present system because we  have a nation that is divided between  the haves and have-nots. Forty million-plus, 44 million, now I hear 32 million persons were uninsured. That’s  what grabbed our attention. Those people did not have access to health care.  Clearly, if you look at the Constitution that says that the 14th AmendDr. CHRISTENSEN GREGORY  ment says equal protection under the  law, all people treated equally, and the  Fifth Amendment says can’t deprive  someone of life or liberty without due  process. Well, I can tell you over the  time that we debated this bill we saw  the numbers of people who actually  died because they could not get access  to health care. We are reminded of our  good  colleague,  Congressman  CUMMINGS, who told the story over and  over again of a young teenager, 12- or  13-year-old boy, African American boy,  who had an abscess, a tooth abscess,  and clearly could have been saved, his  life was before him. But he died because his mother did not have insurance or really did not have access to go  anywhere  to  have  this  particular  health matter taken care of. It became  a crisis, and he died.  So I want to say to my friends, these  are the basic points that I want to  raise today while I discuss this question of the 14th Amendment and the  Fifth Amendment. First of all, you  hear the question of how offended people are, I don’t want to be told to buy  insurance. Why should I have to be  forced to buy insurance? Well, as everyone knows, there is a 10th Amendment that says what is not left to the  Federal Government  is given to the  States. States require you to have auto  insurance. If you do not have it, you  are fined. You get a ticket. Because  they have calculated that the burden of  not having health  insurance  is  too  great to bear. And so when we think of  people not having health insurance because they don’t have access, we have  determined  that  the  burden  is  too  great to bear, $143 billion if this bill is  repealed right away, and $1 trillion  over 20 years that we will lose, or the  deficit will be built. And I would imagine it might be more if you determine  the people that will be uninsured who  will go on to the county system.  Does everybody know in these districts around the Nation who are complaining about this bill that your hospitals, your county hospitals that are  burdening your local taxpayers will be  actually compensated  for uncompensated care? I don’t know about anyone  here, but I can tell you my hospitals  are jumping for joy.  And so I just want to point this out.  Children with preexisting conditions  are denied coverage, that is the sickle  cell child, that is the individual with  heart disease. We determined  in our  Democratic Policy and Steering Committee that children are the greatest  that have the possibility of dying because of lack of coverage. And so all of  these children, asthma, parents who  have children with asthma, they are  born, and there are babies with asthma. Do you realize they cannot or  could not get insurance even on their  parents’ insurance? Asthma. How many  children have died with asthma? Particularly in the minority community,  where we have been subjected to poor  quality  living conditions. Maybe the  air quality, because of where we live,  industrial waste, or maybe  it  is because of the quality of the house that  you are  in, asbestos, other ailments  that create conditions that cause respiratory illnesses in children, those are  respiratory illnesses, young people age  26. A young man by the name of Andrew today said he’s been working very  hard, he graduated from college, but  unfortunately the job that he had offered to him has been pushed back because of the economy. He is working to  get more experience as an intern with  no compensation. His family cannot afford to keep him on to pay for independent insurance at this point. But  yet he is being constructive, and he can  be constructive because he can be on  his  parents’  insurance.  Pregnant  women and breast and prostate cancer  patients, in particular, African American women and minority women have  a devastating form of breast cancer.  My father had prostate cancer, and at  the age he was and the atmosphere  that we were in and the medical access  he had at that time, one, he didn’t tell  the family, two, we were uninformed  about this thing called prostate cancer,  and we didn’t find out about it until it  had metastasized. My father actually  had lung cancer and brain cancer.  There  is  a  statistic: An African  American male over 65 that did not  have the proper access to health care  to be able to catch his prostate cancer.  Now this bill will provide for preventive care so that members, no matter  what economic station you are in or  status you are in, you have the ability  to access health care, meaning you can  go to a community health clinic or the  community health centers, excuse me,  or you may be able to buy your own  health  insurance at the rate  in the  amount you can.  There is a complaint here, as I said,  about lacking the ability or not wanting to buy health insurance. Well, I  would argue to that person, the argument I made about the 10th Amendment and automobile insurance, but I  also argue, would you  rather have  these  individuals die or burden  the  massive  public  health  system?  Or  would you rather have them have access to be healthy as opposed to being  sick?  Then something has been said, job-  killing bill. And one of the points that  the Republicans make is 650,000 jobs  lost. They are not telling the accurate  story. The 650,000 jobs lost are people  deciding not to work or to work less  because they now have the ability to  get their own insurance that is not tied  to a job through the exchange. That is  the accuracy of it. It’s voluntary, voluntary separation from a job because I  am independent now to be able to go  into  business,  to  be  a  sole  entrepreneur, a sole proprietor, and still  have my insurance. And so these people  would immediately be thrown off because a pregnant woman would be considered a preexisting disease; breast  cancer, obviously one of the more devastating diseases; prostate cancer.

119,54,2011-01-18,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is with  great pleasure that I stand before you today to  recognize the Greater Valparaiso Chamber of  Commerce business award winners for 2010  and  to congratulate  the 2010 Distinguished  Community Leader Award recipient, Mr. Bruce  Leetz, and the 2010 Legacy of Service Award  recipient, Mr. Larry Klemz. These outstanding  recipients were honored during the Chamber’s  annual ‘‘Salute to Leadership’’ dinner that took  place on Saturday,  January 15, 2011, at  Strongbow Inn in Valparaiso, Indiana.  The Greater Valparaiso Chamber of Commerce utilizes members of the community in  order to improve the quality of life within the  community of Valparaiso through business development and community service. Each year,  Chamber members and  friends gather  together  to honor  the recipients of  the Distinguished Community Award and the Legacy of  Service Award.  This year, the Greater Valparaiso Chamber  of Commerce  honored  its  2010 Business  Award Winners. Peoples Bank and Urschel  Laboratories were honored with the 100 Years  in Business award. The 75 Years in Business  award was given to Lincoln Office, L.L.C., and  the  recipient of  the 50 Years  in Business  award is G.E. Marshall, Inc. Each business is  dedicated  to providing excellent business  to  the community and for that reason, they are to  be commended.  The 2010 Distinguished Community Leader  Award recipient is Bruce Leetz. A graduate of  Valparaiso High School and Ball State University, Bruce is the President and Chief Executive Officer of North Coast Distributing and has  been employed with the company for over 45  years. A local, family-owned beer wholesaler  since 1939, North Coast, formerly Valpo Beverages, Incorporated, has become one of the  premier  distributors  in  the Midwest  under  Bruce’s leadership. In addition to his successful career, Bruce has continuously been an active  participant  in  his  community,  having  served on the boards of the Northwest Indiana  Forum,  the Greater Valparaiso Chamber of  Commerce, and the Northwest Indiana Entrepreneurship Academy. He is also a past president of the Porter County United Way and the  Valparaiso Rotary Club, and he  is a Ruling  Elder  at  First  Presbyterian  Church  of  Valparaiso. For his outstanding dedication to  serving his community, Bruce is worthy of the  highest praise.  Larry Klemz  is  the  recipient of  the 2010  Legacy of Service Award. Larry  received a  Bachelor of Arts degree  in Business  from  Valparaiso University. During school and following graduation, Larry worked  for Home  Mountain Publishing, which he purchased  in  1978. He previously bought a small printing  company  in Valparaiso named  the Herald  Press and merged  the  two businesses  together. Larry serves as President of his company, which is known today as Home Mountain Printing. Larry’s leadership and dedication  to his company has made Home Mountain  Printing an industry leader in Northwest Indiana. Additionally, Larry spends much time and  effort giving back to the community. He has  served on numerous boards  including: The  Family and Youth Services Bureau, Porter  County United Way, Valparaiso Rotary Club,  Valparaiso YMCA, and the Greater Valparaiso  Chamber of Commerce. Currently, he serves  with  the Porter County Museum Advisory  Council and the Public Education Foundation  of Valparaiso. Larry’s continuous devotion to  his community is to be admired.  Mr. Speaker, clearly Bruce and Larry have  not only been wonderfully successful in their  chosen endeavors, but they have lived selfless  lives. They know, as Charles Dickens wrote  ‘‘the common welfare was  [their] business;  charity, mercy,  forbearance,  benevolence,  were all [their] business.’’  At this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the  Greater Valparaiso Chamber of Commerce  2010 Business Award Winners, as well as  Bruce Leetz and Larry Klemz. For their dedication and commitment to the community of  Valparaiso as well as Northwest Indiana, they  are all worthy of the honors bestowed upon  them.  f  CONGRATULATING TCU HORNED  FROGS  HON. KAY GRANGER  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 18, 2011  ",2011
120,54,2011-01-18,Ms. GRANGER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  offer my congratulations to the TCU Horned  Frogs  football  team  for  their 21–19 victory  over the Wisconsin Badgers in the 2011 Rose  Bowl. Quarterback Andy Dalton was named  the Rose Bowl’s Most Valuable Offensive  Player, while  linebacker Tank Carder was  named the Defensive MVP.  The Rose Bowl attendance of 94,118 was  the largest crowd to ever attend a TCU football game. Excluding the NFL, the 2011 Rose  Bowl Game was  the most-watched event  in  ESPN and cable television history. In addition  to an outstanding performance  in  the Rose  Bowl game, TCU posted its third straight top-  10 ranking this season, and its fourth top-10 in  the  last  six  seasons. TCU’s 13–0 overall  record was the second undefeated season in  program history.  The 13 wins mark the most victories in a  single season for TCU. As any college football  fan knows, breaking  into a BCS game  is a  huge  accomplishment  for  a  non-automatic  qualifying school, and  I am proud  that  the  Horned Frogs became the first non-automatic  qualifying school to play in and win the Rose  Bowl. With  this  feat, TCU has proven once  again that they can play with any college football team in the Nation.  TCU had five first-team All-Americans: linebacker Tank Carder, defensive end Wayne  Daniels, safety Tejay Johnson,  return specialist Jeremy Kerley and center Jake Kirkpatrick. Jake Kirkpatrick won  the Rimington  Trophy as the Nation’s top center.  Congratulations  to  the  team,  the coaches,  and the staff for an outstanding year and an  incredible  performance  in  the Rose Bowl  game. The Horned Frogs have made TCU  and the entire Fort Worth community proud.

127,12,2011-02-01,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  thank the Senator  from Texas very  much  for  letting me make a brief  statement about the amendment I am  about to offer, and apologize for interrupting her comments.  What we have today  is an opportunity—an opportunity—for the majority to reevaluate what it has done on  the issue of health care and to take another path. It is no secret the American people don’t like the health care  bill that was passed last year. If you  have talked with doctors or nurses or  anybody else involved in health care  over the last year, most of them will  tell you they do not like it either. Employers, big and small, have been desperately  trying  to get  the message  across of how damaging this bill will be  to their ability to create jobs. They  tell us the impact of the bill is severe—  higher taxes, penalties for hiring workers, new regulations that have already  run  to more  than  6,000 pages, and  mountains of new paperwork all at a  time when businesses want to create  jobs and millions of Americans are  looking for one.  Don’t take it from me. Here is how  the National Federation of Independent  Business puts it:  Small  business  owners  everywhere  are  rightfully concerned  that  the unconstitutional new mandates, countless rules and  new taxes in the health care law will devastate their businesses and their ability to  create jobs.  Yesterday, a Federal court in Florida  found the crux of the law to be unconstitutional. So we have an opportunity  today—an opportunity  for all  those  who supported the health law—to reevaluate your vote and to  listen to  your constituents, who are desperately  trying to get your attention. You can  say, perhaps, this was a mistake, we  can do this better or you can continue  to dismiss the majority of the people in  this country as not knowing what they  are talking about.  It is not every day that you get a second chance on a big decision after you  know all the facts. Today is one of  those days. For all of us who opposed  the health care bill, today we reaffirm  our commitment to work a little harder to get it right. We can’t afford to get  it wrong.  I urge my colleagues to move beyond  party affiliation. Look at the facts before us. If everyone in this Chamber  evaluated this bill for what it is, we  would repeal it right now, and then we  would begin to work on achieving our  mutual goal of delivering health care  at a higher quality for lower cost. Let  us not miss this opportunity.  AMENDMENTNO. 13  Mr. President, I send an amendment  to the desk, and I ask for its immediate  consideration.  ",2011

I will  finish my  remarks, as  the  ranking  member of the Commerce Committee,  and then I know Senator STABENOW  wants to speak on the first amendment  that is going to be offered. It is probably unrelated to our FAA bill but nevertheless  is very  important  for our  country.  Let me go back to where I was on the  part of the FAA reauthorization bill  that addresses aviation safety. We do  limit the ability of FAA inspectors to  work for air carriers over which they  have had oversight, and we will require  the conducting of independent reviews  of safety issues identified by employees.  We also need to require enhanced  safety oversight of foreign repair stations,  including a minimum of  two  FAA inspections annually, with exceptions for those that have comprehensive bilateral aviation safety maintenance  agreements with  the United  States, and requiring alcohol and drug  testing at any foreign facilities that  perform maintenance on U.S. commercial aircraft.  Finally, the bill also provides infrastructure investment to our Nation’s  airports. As we all know, you can have  the best planes and the best air traffic  system but they mean nothing without  the proper airport  infrastructure  in  place.  This bill contains many  important  provisions and deserves the support of  the Senate.

The history of Colorado’s African-  American communities  is  long, rich  and diverse; it spans from our earliest  days as a territory to modern times. I  think it safe to say that all Coloradans  have benefited tremendously from African-American communities’ hard work  and dedication to continuously making  Colorado a better place to live.  Last year in my remarks on Black  History Month, I made special note of  the diversity of settlers who moved  west  during  the  expansion  of  the  United States. Like other settlers, African Americans moved west in search  of new opportunity—some to be free,  others to become entrepreneurs, traders, and leaders, but all played an active role in the formation of Colorado  as a territory and then a State.

I am joined by Mr. SCHUMER,  Ms. MIKULSKI, and Ms. GILLIBRANDas  original co-sponsors.  The woman, who is known to us as  Harriet Tubman, was born in approximately  1822  in Dorchester County,  Maryland  and  given  the  name  Araminta, Minty, Ross.  She  spent  nearly 30 years of her life in slavery on  Maryland’s Eastern Shore. As an adult  she took the first name Harriet, and  when she was 25 she married John Tubman.  Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery  in 1849. She did so in the dead of night,  navigating the maze of tidal streams  and wetlands that, to this day, comprise the Maryland Eastern Shore landscape. She did so alone, demonstrating  courage, strength and  fortitude that  became her hallmarks. Not satisfied  with attaining her own freedom, she returned  repeatedly  for more  than  10  years to the places of her enslavement  in Dorchester and Caroline counties  where, under the most adverse conditions, she led away many family members and other slaves to freedom in the  Northeastern United States. Tubman  became known as ‘‘Moses’’ by African-  Americans and white abolitionists. She  is the most famous and most important  conductor of the network of resistance  known as the Underground Railroad.

139,12,2011-02-16,Ms. SPEIER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today in opposition to this continuing  resolution,  a  continuing  resolution  that I call the silly, the dangerous and  the hypocritical. Budgets  are more  than just numbers. They are a statement of our values as a Nation.  As a Congress, we are faced with several serious challenges: growing our  economy, putting people back to work,  investing in the future, reducing the  deficit, and ensuring the most vulnerable in our society are protected. Judging on that criteria alone, this CR  doesn’t pass the laugh test.  It would cut 300,000 private sector  transportation jobs, ensuring our construction workers are receiving unemployment checks instead of paychecks.  It would  stifle our  competition.  It  would stifle competitiveness by making Pell Grants less accessible to students and families. And it would run  roughshod over women, children and  the environment. With  such an extreme proposal,  I assume my good  friends on the Republican side would be  coming forward with ideas to improve  it. But what we’ve gotten this week is  a combination of the silly, the dangerous, and the hypocritical.  In the silly department, we have an  amendment  preventing  funds  from  being used to repair the White House.  Now ironically right now, going on in  the Rayburn Building, are remodeling  of hearing  rooms  that  I guess  the  chairmen of  these committees have  found no need  to halt. How much  money is being spent there?  Or how about the amendment preventing  funds  from  being used  for  President Obama’s teleprompter. Oh,  right. We’re going to cut $3,000 from  the budget. That’s really going to help  us.  I  would  expect  this  sort  of  hyperpartisanship on cable TV, but not  in a budget debate.  Under dangerous, we have: several  provisions gutting environmental protection, rolling back EPA regulations  on clean air and clean water, and reducing our investment in clean energy,  making America even more dependent  on foreign oil. How many more solar  in  panels do we want manufactured  China?  How about  the amendment undermining a third party testing requirement at the Consumer Product Safety  Commission? Great. So let’s have Chinese companies pour in more tainted  toys, more  lead- and cadmium-filled  toys for our kids.  How about the reduction in funding  for our first responders, meaning there  will be less cops and less firefighters in  every single neighborhood in this country?  Or how about the amendment preventing funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, meaning  big banks can call the shots again?  Have we learned nothing from the financial meltdown over the last 3 years?  Or how about the unprecedented attack on women’s reproductive health  which will result in more unplanned  pregnancies and more abortions; not  less.  And  finally, the category my colleagues on the Republican side seem to  relish  the most—hypocritical.  The  party that ran on jobs has authored a  budget that would increase the unemployment rolls. Asked about likely job  losses  in  the CR, Speaker BOEHNER  said, ‘‘Well, so be it.’’ It’s like Marie  Antoinette  saying,  ‘‘Let  them  eat  cake.’’  The party that ran on cutting spending didn’t take a scalpel to the defense  budget; they took a toothpick. In fact,  there’s another $2.2 billion in the budget for the V–22 Osprey, which is basically obsolete; $495 million  for nine  Joint Strike Fighters; and $450 for a  second engine that the military defense  budget doesn’t want.  And the party that ran on fiscal responsibility has offered a budget that  will balloon the deficit by continuing  tax cuts for the millionaires and billionaires that don’t need them.  I agree with President Obama, that  we must out-innovate, out-educate and  out-build the rest of the world. While  not perfect, the budget he released this  week will take an important step in  that direction. As  for the silly, the  dangerous and the hypocritical CR we  are considering today, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’  Budgeting is a serious process, and  what  we’re  doing  this  week  is  unserious at least.  f  IMPARTIALITY AND THE SUPREME  COURT  ",2011

141,12,2011-02-16,Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, on a day that we’re talking  about the continuing resolution, I want  to talk about a body that may someday  be judging the continuing resolution—  the Supreme Court. There is perhaps  nothing more important to the preservation of our democracy than the continued guaranteed impartiality of our  Supreme Court. It’s a uniquely American institution; it’s been given enormous power  to  invalidate American  laws; and it needs to be dispensed with  complete blind justice, blind to outside  influence.  However, this Nation’s confidence in  the blind justice of the Supreme Court  has been badly shaken recently by a series of revelations regarding possible  conflicts of interest by Justice Scalia  and Justice Thomas  in the Citizens  United case. This landmark 5–4 decision overturned  restrictions on corporate funding in elections that had  been  in place since 1947, and  immediately thereafter, millions and millions of dollars in shadowy special interest  group  donations  flowed  into  American campaigns. Two of the main  benefactors  of  these  groups  were  Charles and David Koch, billionaire  brothers who operate a Kansas-based  energy business. They spent about $2.6  billion that we know about in the 2010  election cycle and likely a lot more in  anonymous donations.  In addition to funding these outside  groups, they also organize a lot of conferences in which they gather people of  like mind to discuss their radical views  and plot strategies to benefit their interests. Now if I were to ask somebody  on a main street in my district if they  would be comfortable with a Supreme  Court  justice attending a conference  like this, having their plane flight and  the hotel all paid for by the special interests,  I know what  their  answer  would be. They’d say, no way. Yet Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas did just  that and they thought it was just fine.  They didn’t recuse themselves from the  Citizens United decision at all.  But here’s the real problem. This  could be just an isolated problem to  the Citizens United case. Or it could be  much more widespread, with justices  conflicted on several fronts, refusing to  disclose their conflicts or recuse themselves when they have actual conflicts  of interest. But we have no idea, because right now there is no law requiring Supreme Court justices to disclose  their conflicts of interest as is required  of all other Federal justices.  b1120  I don’t believe we should be meddling  in the day-to-day business of the Supreme Court. I get why there is great  wisdom  in separating  legislative and  judicial  functions.  But  there’s  no  undue burden in just requiring sunlight  on Supreme Court proceedings.  So when we return to Washington  after the recess, I will be introducing  legislation to do just that, to implement a few reasonable reforms to add  greater transparency and disclosure requirements on the Supreme Court. I  hope my colleagues will join me.  My legislation will apply the Judicial  Conference’s Code of Conduct to the  Supreme Court, which now applies to  all other Federal judges. It will require  the Justices to simply publicly disclose  why they’ve recused themselves from a  VerDate Mar 15 2010  08:29 Feb 17, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K16FE7.017 H16FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011

The Senate took our 10-month extension that we passed by a vote of 274–144,  and decided to offer a 90-day extension,  which passed by an 86–12 vote.  Even before we saw this extension,  the gentleman from Menomonee Falls,  the  chairman  of  the  Crime  Subcommittee and the former chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, had made a  commitment that he will proceed very  vigorously in the next 90 days to deal  with the questions that my friend has  raised.  I think that many of the questions  that have been raised are valid. That’s  why it is that we need to have this extension, which is scheduled to expire in  one legislative day if we take no action, because I think everyone can acknowledge that the Patriot Act has  played a role in keeping the United  States of America safe.  My two colleagues and I have joined  from the get-go in saying that they  should not have made this measure  permanent, because we were legislating  through the prism of September 11 at  the outset. We felt very strongly that  recognizing the civil liberties of every  single American has to continue to be  a very, very top priority while we look  at what, I think, are the five most important words in the middle of the preamble of the U.S. Constitution, which  are  ‘‘providing  for  the common defense.’’  In his first inaugural address, Thomas Jefferson made it very clear when he  said that a wise and true government  shall restrain men from injuring one  another.  That is why our security has to be of  paramount importance, but it doesn’t  mean it is done at the expense of civil  liberties and the rights of every American.  Well, guess what, Mr. Speaker? The  gentleman who chairs the Crime Subcommittee  is  absolutely  dedicated  within the next 90 days of pursuing  that as vigorously as possible.  b1300  I will say that when this extension  that we’re faced with right now was  passed, last February 25, 1 year ago,  that brought to an end any discussion,  any hearings. That brought to an end  any hearings through the entire rest of  that Congress once the extension was  put into place.  I will  say  that any Member who  wants a classified briefing can request  it, and so the opportunity for classified  briefings on the Patriot Act or any  other measure is there for Members of  this body.  So, Mr. Speaker, it’s clear to me, we  have a 90-day extension that has come  back from the Senate. It will expire in  one legislative day. We want Mr. SENSENBRENNERto begin working with Mr.  LUNGRENand others who have spent so  much time and energy in dealing with  the questions of the lone wolf and roving wiretaps and all that. We need to  have that addressed as quickly possible.  So let’s do it, let’s do it now, let’s  pass this thing in a bipartisan way and  get it done.

152,36,2011-02-16,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Madam Chair, we all  recognize  the  need for us to reduce the deficit and  curtail unreasonable spending, but this  continuing resolution obviously goes  far too  in the extreme direction of  harming our  economy and harming  many of the services that our citizens  have come to rely on to  finish and  bring  their  lives  together, whether  they’re working, whether  they need  health  care, whether  their  children  need education, and this resolution is  harmful for that.  But I want to speak for the moment  on section 1475, which is a rider that is  added to this legislation that will harm  the California economy, harm our ability to plan into the future for the use  of water.  We have a water system in California  that’s  dramatically  oversubscribed,  and we’re in the process now of bringing that together to make sure that we  can meet the future economic needs of  our State and also the needs of the various sectors of that economy, whether  they be the fishing sector, they be the  energy producing sector, the farming  sector or the settlement of our cities.  But with this rider—this rider, first  of all, throws out 18 years of litigation  successfully brought to an end, a long  conflict on the San Joaquin River to  provide for that settlement, a settlement that is agreed to by almost everyone. But more importantly, for the  sake of the long-term water using, this  amendment  defunds  the  biological  opinions that were going forward that  are the cornerstone to provide for the  final elements of the plan to provide  California and the apportionment of  that water for the protection of the  fisheries and the economies in northern  California,  for the protection  in the  water supplies of the Central Valley’s  economy and the needs of the great  urban  areas  of  southern California.  That planning must be completed.  This is as close as we’ve come. After  decades and decades of water wars in  the State of California, we finally have  the opportunity now to bring the various parties  together  from all geographic regions, from all sectors of the  economy, and plan the future of our  State so that we will have the water  that is necessary to secure our economy, to secure our families, to secure  our agricultural areas of the State, and  to provide for the great ecology of the  State of California.  We’ve gone through some disasters, if  you will, because of the droughts, because of water cycles, and my colleague from further north in the State,  MIKETHOMPSON, laid out this. We saw  thousands of  jobs  lost, the  fisheries  decimated because of political water  decisions that were made over the last  several years that decimated the salmon run, not only affecting just the San  Francisco Bay delta but affecting the  coastal regions of our State and the  coastal regions of Oregon and Washington.  These are important fisheries. This is  an important part of our economy. It’s  a renewable part of our economy if we  take care of it, but if we have mindless  riders that are put onto legislation like  the one provided in section 1475, it will  bring an end to these negotiations.  It’s taken a  long time to get the  water parties from the south, the water  parties from industry, the water parties from agriculture, from the environmental community and the government,  the Federal Government and  State government together. They are  sitting at that table and they’re working it through.  Just in the last couple of days, we see  the delta planning organization put  forth its first document to say what  the requirements will be for the conservation habitat plan that all of these  elements from north and south California working on. This amendment  simply kicks  that negotiating  table  over. It drives the parties away from  the negotiation, and California goes  back into water uncertainty, economic  uncertainty,  ecological  uncertainty  that our State cannot continue to have  if we’re going to grow our economy, if  we’re going to come out of this recession.  So I would hope that on passage the  Members would vote against this continuing resolution, understanding the  kind of damage that these kinds of riders that were inserted in the middle of  the night on behalf of a few special interests have the opportunity to really  destroy,  destroy  bipartisan  geographical negotiations  that are  the  most promising in the last 40 years in  the history of our State.  The opposition from so many of the  water users across the State, no matter  where they reside, to this rider is well-  known, to the fishing community, to so  many parts of our economy in the San  Joaquin-Sacramento Bay delta, and to  the future of our ability to get a handle  on  these  water  issues  that  have  plagued us for so many years in California. I would hope that we would reject this provision of this legislation.  b1530  ",2011

Madam Chair, water in California is  never a dull subject. As we try to repair the delta and prepare our water  system for the generations to come, it  is imperative that we make progress  and not take steps backwards. That  means achieving a healthy delta and  finding a way for water users throughout California to receive their water  without harming the delta. The amendments  to  the  continuing  resolution  that defund and cut funding from the  San Joaquin River Restoration,  the  Central Valley Project Restoration  Fund, and the implementation of the  biological opinion of the delta smelt  and salmon are steps backwards.  The balance that we have been trying  to achieve in California is a negotiation that must not be thrown off balance. Decades of work toward a more  certain future for California water is  only attainable when everyone works  toward a solution rather than throw up  VerDate Mar 15 2010  08:29 Feb 17, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K16FE7.081 H16FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011

158,44,2011-02-16,Ms. TSONGAS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the underlying bill.  I was an early and strong supporter  of the President’s bipartisan commission on the debt; and while I do not  agree with all of the commission’s recommendations, I recognize that their  report to the President offered an important starting point for debate on an  issue that affects the  lives of every  American, as well as  future generations.  In the report, the commission warns  against disrupting our fragile economic  recovery:  ‘‘We need a comprehensive  plan now to reduce the debt over the  long  term. But budget  cuts  should  start gradually so they don’t interfere  with the ongoing economic recovery.  Growth is essential to restoring fiscal  strength and balance. We should cut  red tape and unproductive government  spending that hinders job creation and  growth. But at the same time we must  invest in education, infrastructure, and  high-value research and development  to help our economy grow, keep us  globally competitive, and make it easier for businesses to create jobs.’’  The bill before us fails to heed this  sound advice, making shortsighted decisions that will sabotage our short-  term recovery and undermine our long-  term competitiveness. The reckless decisions made in this bill will lead to  lost jobs in my district and throughout  the Nation.  Some of these job losses are obvious.  Deep cuts to COPS and SAFER funding  will ensure that we will lose thousands  of police officers and firefighters protecting our communities nationwide;  but other losses may be less obvious  but just as painful.  For instance, this legislation imposes  deep cuts on the food Food and Drug  Administration.  Every  single  drug,  vaccine, biologic and medical device  must be approved by the FDA before it  can ever be offered to patients. This  means that not only do patients rely  on the FDA but also American pharmaceutical and medical device companies  that need an efficient and effective  FDA to ensure that they can continue  to innovate, grow, and create jobs.  We are lucky to have a medical device industry in this country that is on  the cutting edge of technological advances in medicine. What we should be  doing is modernizing the FDA to make  it more efficient, transparent, predictable, and rigorous; and to do that, we  need to ensure that the FDA has all the  necessary resources to conduct proper  and speedy review of life-saving devices  that not only benefit patients but our  innovative businesses so that many of  them can get to work putting people to  work.  For these private sector firms, cutting FDA  resources means  slowing  down their approval process, driving  some of  them overseas, and  losing  many jobs here in our country as well.  Likewise,  cuts  to  local  funding  included in this bill will harm communities I represent, particularly the deep  cuts to the Community Development  Block Grant program. When  I have  asked leaders in the cities I represent  how we can best help their recovery efforts, the answer has been unhesitating  and unequivocal: CDBG funding.  Last week, the city manager in my  hometown  of Lowell wrote,  saying,  ‘‘This is probably the most valuable  tool that the Federal Government offers cities to address economic development, infrastructure, and community  needs.’’  What is most discouraging about the  attack on CDBG funding is that it does  just what my colleagues say they support: it provides local flexibility, allowing  stakeholders  to decide what  makes  sense  for  their communities,  while ensuring an extremely efficient  use of funds. For example, last year in  the city of Lowell, every $1 in CDBG  funding generated more than $16 in additional funding.  Over the years, Lowell has successfully used CDBG funds to redevelop a  historic building into a much-needed  senior center, turning a blight into a  landmark and prompting the entry of  private businesses nearby. It has used  funds to spur the development of a  mixed-use development that is bringing in millions of dollars in private development and restoring architectural  treasures key to the city’s  identity.  And it has provided seed money to nonprofits like the United Teen Equality  Center, recognized nationally for the  revolutionary work they’re doing every  day to curb gang violence in the city of  Lowell.  All of these actions have improved  the quality of life and created jobs for  Lowell residents, and none might have  been made possible without this modest Federal investment.  So I do not support the underlying  bill, and I encourage its rejection.  ",2011

161,44,2011-02-16,Ms. MCCOLLUM.," I rise today to let  the American people and all MinnesoI  tans know that this continuing resolution is an unprecedented assault on our  public health and environment.  We know that the Federal budget is  in crisis, and we know we must make  tough choices; but those choices must  be prudent, wise, and invest in our future. It should not put the basic health  of Americans at risk. The Republicans’  plan before us proposes to cut $3 billion  from the EPA’s budget, the largest percentage cuts to this critical agency in  30 years.  b1640  The bill also proposes radical policy  language to keep the EPA from carrying out its historic mission—a mission to protect the health of the American people—by  limiting  the EPA’s  ability to enforce the Clean Air Act  and Clean Water Act.  The EPA needs to be allowed to do  its job, and it needs the resources to do  this job. This bill would cause the EPA  to lay off 80 percent of its employees  who are responsible for protecting public health.  State clean water programs are gutted by $2 billion  in the Republican  budget. Our  local  communities  are  struggling with their own budgets, and  these vital  funds allow  for communities to hire engineers, construction  workers, to upgrade water plants and  drinking water projects.  It is the EPA’s investment in clean  water that allows parents to know that  if their child walks up to a drinking  fountain anywhere  in America, they  can have the peace of mind that that  water is safe for their child to drink.  These  irresponsible  cuts  jeopardize  that peace of mind.  The EPA does important work, and  the work  that  the EPA does  saves  lives. I strongly oppose these reckless  Republican cuts and radical deregulation proposals that endanger our communities. Congress needs to make difficult choices. Mr. Chair, I believe that  these are foolhardy choices to shortchange clean air, clean water, and the  health of our families.  On Monday, I received over 1,000 valentines from Minnesotans, and those  valentines were dedicated to the EPA.  My constituents understand the important work that the EPA has done to  protect our water, our land, and their  health over the past 40 years. And it’s  work that they  feel must continue.  This continuing resolution would turn  back all the tremendous progress we  have made in cleaning up our environment, and I firmly reject it and urge  my colleagues to do as well.  Mr. Chair, with that, I yield back the  balance of my time.  ",2011

Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the last word.  ",2011
167,52,2011-02-16,The Acting CHAIR.," The gentleman  from New Mexico is recognized for 5  minutes.  Mr. LUJA´N. I rise today in opposition to the drastic cuts in this continuing resolution and the amendments  that make further cuts that threaten  to weaken our economy and destroy  jobs.  It is critical that while we face growing budget constraints we do not shortchange  investments that will create  jobs or provide vital services that New  Mexicans rely on.  Unfortunately, many of the cuts proposed in this bill and in a number of  amendments would negatively impact  our communities in New Mexico. For  example, in the wake of the natural gas  outages that left thousands of homes  across the State without heat, this bill  cuts the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps working  families, senior citizens, and disabled  individuals heat their homes.  At a time when New Mexico needs  critical  investments  in education so  that we can prepare our children to be  the next generation of  leaders,  the  House Republican plan makes drastic  cuts to education at all levels. Beginning with early education, Republicans  cut the Head Start program, which  helps build a strong foundation for New  Mexico’s children. The bill also cuts  programs that help poor school districts. With more than one-third of  New Mexico’s students failing to graduate  from high school, we must do  more, not less, to ensure our children  succeed. In addition, the Republican  bill cuts Pell Grants that our young  adults rely on to help make college  more affordable.  Arbitrary cuts to New Mexico’s national labs that are contained in this  bill will hinder their ability to promote  U.S. competitiveness and job creation.  We’re ending our ability to win the  race before we can even begin. Instead  of making these cuts, we need to outpace the competition. We need to out-  educate and out-innovate the rest of  the world in order to grow our economy and put people back to work right  here in New Mexico.  And  as we  debate  the  proposed  amendments in this section of the bill,  I am extremely concerned with amendments that will be proposed today that  make cuts to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  In New Mexico, we  take pride in our beautiful landscapes  and the protection of our water. The  LWCF has helped to protect dozens of  New Mexico  icons,  including Tent  Rocks  National Monument,  Valles  Caldera National Preserve, Rio Grande  River Gorge, Santa Fe National Forest,  and Petroglyphs National Monument,  just to name a few.  These attacks on the Land and Water  Conservation Fund would eliminate a  bipartisan program that has existed for  45 years by preventing revenues deposited in the LWCF account from being  used  for  their  authorized  purposes,  such as protecting public  lands and  promoting recreation.  The Land and Water Conservation  Fund was established by Congress in  1964 as a bipartisan conservation offset  for offshore oil and gas drilling. Under  current law, Outer Continental Shelf  oil and gas leases and royalty receipts  are deposited in a dedicated LWCF account in the Treasury. However, only a  fraction of the annual receipts deposited  in the LWCF have been appropriated, despite a surplus of over $17  billion.  In New Mexico, outdoor recreation is  an integral part of the economy, and I  know when I visit with many of our  colleagues here in the Congress, Democrats  and Republicans,  everyone  is  eager to get out to New Mexico. The  Outdoor Industry Association reports  that recreation contributes about $730  billion annually to the U.S. economy,  supports nearly 6.5 million jobs across  the country, and generates $88 billion  in annual State and national tax revenues.  A recent study by The Trust for Public Land found that every $1 invested in  the LWCF  returns  $4  in  economic  value. Protecting the Land and Water  Conservation Fund will expand opportunities for all Americans to have access to parks and natural areas for outdoor recreation and for hunting.  Protecting the Land and Water Conservation Fund has  immediate  relevance to our efforts to create jobs in  this country, and it is critically important that we ensure funding for this  important Federal  program  is  protected, while also working together to  find a permanent solution to LWCF  funding shortfalls over the long term.  I urge my colleagues to oppose these  amendments and vote  ‘‘no’’ on this  shortsighted  spending bill  that will  hurt families and put more people out  of work. While Republicans say, So be  it, to chopping American jobs, the people of New Mexico deserve better.  ",2011

178,68,2011-02-16,Mr. MORAN.," I rise in strong opposition to this amendment that would  eliminate  funding  for  the Presidio  Trust.  The Presidio was in continuous use  as a military post from 1776 until 1994.  An Army  installation, the post was  closed in 1994 as part of the BRAC process and transferred to the National  Park Service. In 1996, Congress established the Presidio Trust to govern this  unique national park site and to ensure  its preservation by making it financially self-sustaining. And that’s exactly what has happened.  Over the past 12 years, appropriations as a percentage of the overall  trust budget have been reduced from  over 95 percent Federal funding in fiscal year 1998 to less than 20 percent in  fiscal year 2010. The current ratio of  private investment in the Presidio to  Federal  appropriations  is  already  greater  than  4:1.  Appropriations,  though, are authorized through fiscal  year 2012. That was the deal. After 2012,  the trust itself, by itself, alone, is responsible for long-term operations and  maintenance of the Presidio.  Since it took over management of  the Presidio in 1998, the trust has rehabilitated and leased 97 percent of the  Presidio’s housing units and rehabilitated 75 percent of the Presidio’s 433  very historic buildings. I’ve been there.  I’ve seen it. It’s phenomenal what the  trust has accomplished.  Eliminating funds just 1 year short of  its goal violates the spirit of the 1996  law, and it undermines the trust’s ability  to achieve  self-sufficiency. This  would result in higher future obligations,  as  the  Federal Government  might have to assume  full responsibility to maintain the historic properties.  It also sends a terrible signal to communities across the country that may  also  have  innovative  solutions  in  partnering with the Federal Government. They  are  time-controlled;  in  other words, it’s not forever. But they  say  for a certain period of time,  if  you’ll partner with us, we’ll take this  responsibility off your hands.  The $23 million appropriated for the  trust in fiscal year 2010 has created 860  jobs. Federal appropriations  in  this  current fiscal year will help expedite  rehabilitation of historic buildings and  take advantage of favorable construction costs that exist today.  At a recent oversight hearing, the  members of our Appropriations subcommittee  received  assurances  that  the trust will accomplish its financial  stewardship and public use goals. That  was the deal. They said, We’ll meet our  part of the deal, assuming that the  Federal Government will meet its obligation.  As one of the Nation’s oldest and  most  important military posts,  the  trust has had some unique extraordinary challenges since the Defense Department closed out  its  installation,  but the trust is well on its way toward  meeting  its  legislative objectives.  It  should not  be undermined  by  this  amendment.  This has worked well. It’s an example  for the rest of the country. Let it serve  as an example. One more year to go,  and then it will be off our books. The  trust will take over responsibility, and  we will point out that this is the way  to do it, in partnership, where we will  not be perpetually responsible but, in  fact, the private sector will come in,  let the market work and have a national gem, really, a national asset for  everyone to visit and appreciate and  learn from.  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time and strongly urge opposition to this amendment.  ",2011

181,68,2011-02-16,Mr. SIMPSON.," Madam Chairman, I  rise in concurrence with the comments  of my ranking member from Virginia.  Funding for the Presidio in this CR is  $8.2 million below the FY10 enacted  level, and $7 million below the fiscal  year 2008 level.  When the government closed down  the Presidio Army base in 1994, it was  transferred to the National Park Service as part of the Golden Gate National  Recreation Area. It could have been  turned over to the National Park Service and run as a historic park, but that  would have cost tens of millions of dollars per year to the taxpayers. Instead,  Congress devised a unique management  and funding model by creating the Presidio Trust to preserve the Presidio and  help  it become  financially self-sufficient. The trust manages 80 percent of  the Presidio lands, including most of  the buildings and infrastructure. The  Park Service manages the remaining 20  percent, including the coastal areas of  the Presidio. The Presidio Trust receives Federal appropriations that are  diminishing each year and, as was mentioned, will cease at the end of FY12,  when it becomes self-sufficient.  This truly is a model of how we can  do these things where they will become  self-sufficient and off the roll of the  taxpayer. But our part of this is we  have to keep our end of the deal. And  so through FY12 we need to make sure  that we keep our word on what was  agreed on in 1996 and let this Presidio  Trust take over and become self-sufficient at the end of the next fiscal year.  So I rise in opposition to this amendment and would encourage my colleagues to vote against it.  ",2011

187,76,2011-02-16,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," Madam  Chair, let me thank the former chair of  the Health and Human Services Subcommittee and now the ranking member, Ms. DELAURO, and the manager  and the chairman of the subcommittee.  I thought, Madam Chairwoman, that  we lived in a country that was a land of  the free and the brave. We had a sense  of pride in the progress that America  has made, and we have always said we  would never want to go back, whether  it has to do with actual equal rights for  women, whether it is civil rights and  the ability to be empowered to vote.  But I stand on the floor today with a  great deal of disappointment because it  seems as if, with this continuing resolution, that will literally stop in its  tracks the functioning of this government. We are really going back.  I rise to support the Lowey amendment because  I  really can’t believe  that this CR is eliminating $327 million  in family planning. It just baffles the  mind that this critical aspect of health  care is now in jeopardy. It is now being  part of turning the clock back. It is  amazing that we would not acknowledge the fact that lives of women have  been saved, lives of young girls have  been saved because they’ve had access  to family planning.  As much as we have fought to be able  to ensure that around the world where  indigent women who have  lost their  lives through the birthing process now  have access to good medical care—and  yes, family planning—so that they can  have live births, now we come here to  the soil of the United States, and to  take $327 million out of the mouths and  the hands of women and children—yes,  children who can be born healthy. Children who are part of the health care  process that these women are able to  secure through the many clinics that  are around this Nation and in this community.  I am disappointed in the games that  are played with Planned Parenthood  and to be able to demonize them with  false and fraudulent tapings and a lot  of bogus arguments about the fact that  they are not in the business of helping  people.  I am disappointed  in using  those tactics because this is a very serious issue. Mrs. LOWEY’s amendment  addresses the seriousness of it because  she  realizes  that  if we were  to go  through with the elimination of $327  million, there would be many, many  lives that are lost.  We have a Planned Parenthood office  in my community. It is mostly focusing its attention on educating the community about healthy births, about ensuring that teenagers are not alone  when decisions have to be made, decisions that will allow for the healthy  birth or determination that is made by  their  faith  leader with their  family.  They will not be left alone. In fact,  family planning and Planned Parenthood extinguishes, I hope for good, the  back alley procedures and, as well, the  rusty hangers that were used in years  past.  Just a day or two ago, we heard of a  horrible abortion clinic that saw the  lives lost of babies and their mothers  because of the dastardly tactics that  were being used. That is not what we  speak of here today. We speak of the  right of a woman to be able to choose  but also to accept the good health care  of family planning.  b2130  We speak of the rights of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence that really ensure that we all  are created equal, with certain inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The Bill of Rights,  which allows us due process, is what is  being denied in this continuing resolution for, as we speak, if that money is  eliminated,  clinics  around America  will have their doors closed.

191,84,2011-02-16,Mrs. MCMORRIS  RODGERS.," Mr.  Chairman, my amendment is simple. It  increases funding for the part B program of  IDEA, which provides educational grants to States for children  with disabilities, by $557 million, restoring funding for the program to 2010  levels. The amendment is fully offset  by reducing  funding to the Teacher  Quality State Grant program and the  School  Improvement Grant program,  two programs that have received substantial funding increases since 2009.  Mr. Chairman, 35 years ago Congress  recognized that too many special needs  children were being denied an education and the opportunity to maximize their potential and contribution  to our society, and 35 years ago severely disabled children who were confined to State institutions received no  education. Special needs students did  not attend school. They were kept out  of  classrooms,  receiving  little  education.  b2240  Today, more than 6 million children  receive an effective education because  of IDEA. Special needs children are no  longer confined  to  institutions. The  number of special needs students who  graduate high school with a diploma  has increased. The number of children  who go on to enroll in high school has  more than tripled since IDEA’s enactment. And through IDEA, we have increased our Nation’s expectations of  our children. But more can and must  be done.  The  McMorris  Rodgers/Kline/Sessions/Harper amendment ensures that  Congress keeps its promise. Too often  IDEA is overlooked in our education  debates. For example, Congress has yet  to meet its commitment to cover 40  percent of a student’s cost. Barriers to  reliable  research  prevent  effective  teaching. Low expectations continue to  plague our school systems. The reductions to IDEA in H.R. 1 are just another example of the challenges that  IDEA experiences.  This amendment reaffirms that there  is no greater priority in Congress than  ensuring all children have access to an  appropriate education.  I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

194,84,2011-02-16,Ms. DELAURO.," Providing a quality  education  for all students,  including  those with disabilities, should be one of  our highest priorities. So I agree with  the goal of this amendment.  But, in fact, we are considering a Republican  resolution,  this  continuing  resolution this evening, and  it’s the  majority party, to which the gentlewoman belongs, which cuts IDEA. It  cuts special education by $558 million.  So now we have an amendment that attempts to undo the damaging cuts to  IDEA, but only by cutting other critical education programs. The damage  done in this bill cannot be alleviated  by robbing Peter to pay Paul. That’s  what this amendment is about.  Let me just mention to you that—  and our colleague spoke about special  education and what it does. But $558  million is where they come from with  regard to education for special needs  kids. What that means is almost 7,000  special education teachers and aides  and other staff who serve these youngsters would not be there. And it is critical. Teachers and staff are critical to  the education of these youngsters. As a  matter of  fact, the Federal Government mandates that local school districts have to provide this education.  And when it was determined that that  would be the case,  it said that the  States would do 60 percent, the Federal  Government would do 40 percent.  What’s happened now is we’ve been at  about 17 percent in terms of Federal  contribution. With the $558 million cut  we go down to about 15 percent.  I would suggest that if there is such  a great urgent need and a great burning desire to be able to provide education to special needs children, that  we do not cut $558 million.  Now, where does the money come  from? As I mentioned, we’re talking  about  other  critical  education  programs. School improvement grants. I  venture to say that everybody is concerned about those schools that are  failing, that there’s got to be student  achievement  at  these  schools. And  that’s what the current Federal law requires, that there’s demonstrable success in student achievement. The funds  for the school improvement grants are  appropriated  precisely  for  those  schools that fail the test and are seeking to implement a strategy for turning around our Nation’s  lowest-performing  schools.  That’s  where  we  would take money  from  in order to  turn a potentially  failing school, to  turn around so that they can go from  the  lowest-performing  to better-performing schools.  The other place that my colleague  takes funds from is something called  the Teacher Quality Grants, an approximately $3 billion program and a  major piece of No Child Left Behind.  This  provides  funds  to States  and  school districts to develop and support  a high quality teacher force.  Aren’t we all about making sure that  those people who teach our children  are qualified to do that? These funds  are  distributed  by  formula  to  all  States. They are relied upon tremendously to reduce class size, to ensure  that classroom teachers have the proper training and credentials to be effective instructors.  There isn’t a day that goes by that  we aren’t talking about school reform,  and at the center of school reform is to  develop quality teachers. And, in fact,  we want to try to link merit pay to  quality teachers, do everything we can,  but my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle would like to take the money  for school improvement grants, teacher  quality grants.  I suggest to you that what you do, if  you are really truly interested in educating special needs children, that you  VerDate Mar 15 2010  08:29 Feb 17, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A16FE7.062 H16FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011

200,92,2011-02-16,Ms. MOORE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise to  support  the Chu-Moore-Jackson Lee  amendment for the continuing appropriations act, H.R. 1, because we’re  deeply concerned about the cuts to the  Pell Grant  funding contained  in the  continuing  resolution  which  would  slash funding by $845, a 15 percent cut,  and, of course, this amendment would  preserve the Pell Grant program and  maintain the full award level.  I am, you know, again, just a little  bit perturbed, Mr. Chairman. This cut,  like so many cuts in the resolution,  would disproportionately harm traditionally underserved communities. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, Pell recipients are  more likely to be female, first-generation college students, and less likely to  be white than those who don’t receive  the grants. In other words, Mr. Chairman, they kind of look like me.  Minority  students  also  face  disproportionate  unmet  need, meaning  the amount that they still need to pay  for college even after family contributions,  parties,  raising money  from  their  churches,  grants,  nonprivate  loans still will not meet their needs to  go to college. Women sometimes come  into college with more precarious fialready  They’re  nancial  situations.  parents and mothers.  Now, you know, if this country is  prepared to just slide into irrelevancy  in the global economic community because we don’t educate our workforce,  this would be the loss leading legislation to do that. Cutting the program is  so counterintuitive to our remaining a  first-rate power.  And what is our secret weapon in this  country for staying on top? It’s our diversity, our diversity to be competitive. We’re women. We’re blacks. We’re  Asians. We’re Hispanics. We’re Indians.  We’re Hmong. We bring different talents and abilities to the table, and our  ability to educate these young people  comes with our ability to provide a  Pell Grant which  levels the playing  field for all students.  There’s not a politician in this country that doesn’t make part of their  platform that this country has got to  have a highly educated 21st century  workforce. There’s not a politician,  Democrat, Republican, Independent, or  any other stripe, that doesn’t say and  pronounce that education is the key,  and yet we’re not willing to provide the  lubricant so that key can fit into the  lock, and that is the resources to make  sure our students can go to school.  This Pell Grant is that opportunity.  Don’t deny it to students. Don’t deny  it. Don’t deny it, Mr. Chair.  ",2011

Mr. Chairman,  the  public  doesn’t  care whether the deficit is reduced by  closing a  tax  loophole or  reducing  spending.

212,116,2011-02-16,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. President, I rise  to briefly do three things. No. 1, there  are a lot of politicians and pundits and  economists who are proclaiming all  over the country that the recession is  over. They have some economic models  by which they determine that the recession is over. I suggest those pundits  and economists and politicians take a  look at the booklet we recently produced in my office. It is called ‘‘Struggling Through the Recession—Letters  from Vermont.’’  We have also received letters from  other States, people in other States as  well. We sent out a request for people  to tell us, as we enter the third year of  this recession, what  is happening  in  their  lives. We got,  from my small  State, over 400 responses. That is a lot  from a small State. We probably received an equal number from around  the rest of the country.  The problem I had with these letters,  some of them are so painful to read  that it is hard to read more than a few  at a time because you get sick to your  stomach hearing what good and decent  and  hard-working  people  are  going  through.  I wish to take a few moments to read  a handful of the letters I am receiving  from Vermont, in answer to the question: Is the recession over?  This comes from a young lady from  central Vermont. She says:  I have been fortunate to hold onto my job  throughout the past 3 years, especially since  I have about $42,000 remaining on my school  loans.  One of the recurring themes we hear  from all over Vermont—and I suspect  it is true in New Mexico and all over  the country—is a lot of young people  are graduating with a heck of a lot of  debt. The jobs they are getting are not  sufficient,  in terms of pay, to help  them pay off that debt.

I congratulate our manager, Senator ROCKEFELLER, who is one of the most experienced people in the Senate and is a  good manager. He has worked well with  Senator HUTCHISON, comanager of the  bill.  We  have  made  significant  progress. We have a few amendments  on which we are trying to work a way  to the end of this. I hope we can work  out an agreement to complete this legislation maybe as early as tomorrow  morning sometime.  If we can’t, the  first cloture vote is tomorrow, and we  will see what happens after that.  Everyone  should understand.  It  is  Wednesday. Tomorrow is Thursday. I  know a  lot of people have arrangements because we have a home work  period the following week. We want to  go home, if at all possible, late tomorrow night or early Friday morning, but  we can’t do that if there is work left to  be done on this bill. I hope we can work  something out so we can finish tomorrow. It would certainly be doable.  We know what we have left. Work on  the different issues has been extremely  difficult and time-consuming, but we  have settled most everything on the  Senate floor, as we are supposed to do.  There will be no more rollcall votes  tonight. We hope we can move forward  to complete work on this most important  piece  of  legislation  tomorrow.  This  legislation  is extremely  important for our country.  Let’s keep in mind, this deals with  people. Almost 300,000 jobs will be created or saved with this legislation. I repeat what I have said on the Senate  floor once before. McCarran Airport in  Las Vegas is the sixth busiest airport  in the country. The manager of that  airport, Randy Walker, when asked  about this bill last week, said: If it  passes, we will finally be able to stop  using World War II technology to land  and have airplanes take off.  It is not just McCarran in Las Vegas.  At every airport in the country it is  the same thing, World War II technology. We will be able to have a passengers’ bill of rights. It is a very fine  piece of legislation that has been years  in the making. We are too close to the  end of this to walk away. We have to  finish this bill. It means jobs, real jobs,  not make believe jobs.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2011

223,148,2011-02-16,Mr. BENISHEK.," Mr. Chairman,  it  is my  strong belief  that  the pre-eminent  reason a  majority of Northern Michigan’s citizens selected me to be their representative in Washington was to do everything possible to rein in  out-of-control Federal spending. My focus has  been to support such efforts while working to  ensure that policies coming out of the Nation’s  Capital—tax, monetary, and regulatory—serve  to encourage private enterprise so Northern  Michigan has the chance to experience economic growth.  My first 44 days in office have taught me a  great deal about the budget process and the  ‘‘spending ways of Washington.’’ Each day we  have been in session I have typically had 5–  10 meetings with organizations, companies  and Washington reps all seeking to keep their  programs free of any spending cuts. No one in  Washington has asked me to spend less. In  fact,  it seems  in every Washington meeting  while there occasionally is a recognition of the  doom America  faces  if  the current spending  continues, each meeting usually closes with  an expected  refrain  ‘‘. . . yes we need  to  spend less but not our program.’’  By contrast, during my first visit home, just  about everyone in the First District asked me  to make sure the Federal Government spends  less. In Northern Michigan there seems to be  a strong consensus that Federal budget red  ink can no longer continue at record pace.  Here are my guiding ‘‘spend less’’ principles  in this 112th Congress:  Shared Responsibility: Before there is any  comprehensive entitlement reform effort, every  Federal department should be prepared to live  with less money in 2012 than it received in  2011.  Sunlight and Transparency: All spending decisions should be made in a fully transparent  legislative process. No backdoor earmarks, no  special interest amendments. If a program has  merit  its supporters should defend  the program in public floor debate.  Tighten the Revenue Spigot: Simply sending  more money  to Washington  is not going  to  solve  the problem of unchecked spending;  every year the U.S. Treasury receives more  money; every year  the Federal Government  spends more than it takes in. Consequently,  increasing taxes is not the answer.  If not now, when? I have publicly promised  to  limit my career  in Congress  to  just  three  terms. America’s future is more important than  any one of us in Congress, certainly more important  than any political  job.  I’d  rather do  what I think is right than simply keep this position. I trust the voters.  In my view,  the debt  is not a Republican  issue or a Democrat issue. It is an American  issue.  The  failure of previous Congresses  to act  means America now faces a $14 trillion debt.  For every dollar Congress allocates the U.S.  Treasury has to borrow up to $.40 to pay for  it. That means indebting ourselves to countries  like China and mortgaging our children’s  future.  Let me be clear, this will not be easy. To  stem the tide, many tough decisions will need  to be made. Northern Michigan—like the entire  country—has a backlog of worthy projects and  its people have benefited from admirable public programs. The reductions in H.R. 1 affect  every community in the nation. These are hard  decisions for Congress to make, and not everyone will be happy with everything that has  been proposed. This is understandable, but I  believe  these  reductions are necessary  to  show that Congress is serious about returning  our country to a sustainable financial path.  The Continuing Resolution to be considered  on the House Floor this week is just the first  step. Fortunately, the President’s budget proposal  is merely a suggestion  that Congress  can  improve upon.  In my view, Congress  needs to offer a more fiscally sound budget for  FY 2012.  Additionally, it is my view that Congress will  need to consider reforming entitlements programs. Social Security and Medicare are important programs  that millions of Americans  depend on. Without reform, both of these programs face bankruptcy. In my opinion, Congress needs to consider solutions to avoid this  crisis that ensures benefits under Social Security and Medicare are not reduced for those  Americans currently receiving benefits.  And  I  think most of my colleagues agree  this is not a time to play politics. The inflamed  rhetoric and scare attacks on cutting grandma’s benefits have no place here. This week’s  vote will not take away benefits for anyone receiving benefits. Instead, Congress will have  completed the first step and as the Constitution dictates, the Senate and the President will  have their say.  f  TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ‘‘BILLY’’  LYON  HON.

224,148,2011-02-16,Mr. BONNER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to pay  tribute  to a  longstanding business  leader  in  South Alabama, Mr. William ‘‘Billy’’ Lyon, who  recently passed away at the age of 80.  A native of Mobile, Mr. Lyon graduated from  Murphy High School in 1944 and attended the  Citadel  in Charleston, South Carolina before  joining the Navy in 1945, where he served on  the USS Chicago. Following  the end of  the  war, he attended Auburn University and  the  University of North Carolina.  A natural entrepreneur, Mr. Billy became a  homebuilder with a lifelong passion for commercial and  residential  real estate development in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida and Georgia.  He developed scores of  local  residential  subdivisions, including Brookwood, Blacksher  Downs, Tuthill Lane Estates and Carriage  Hills, and sold lots to nearly every builder in  Mobile. He also partnered and developed numerous commercial shopping centers, including Mobile’s Bel Air Mall, which opened  in  1966.  He was one of the founding board members  of Commercial Guaranty Bank  in Mobile,  which later became SouthTrust Bank, and also  served on the Boards of Bel Air Corporation,  Mobile Gas Company, First Southern Federal,  Altus Bank, the Drug Education Council, and  the Alabama School of Math and Science.  Mr. Billy was the longest active member of  the Home Builders Association of Mobile and  received the E. L. Jones award in 2002. He  witnessed and played a vital role in Mobile for  many  years,  helping  countless  individuals,  bankers, builders, realtors, friends and associates along the way.  On behalf of the people of South Alabama,  I extend my condolences to his wife, Patricia;  their  two  sons, BJ and  Jimmy;  their  four  daughters, Tricia, Nancy, Victoria and Ashley;  nineteen grandchildren and their entire family.  You are all in our thoughts and prayers.  f  HONORING DR. MICHAEL COLLINS  HON. MIKE QUIGLEY  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 16, 2011  ",2011
225,148,2011-02-16,Mr. QUIGLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor the distinguished career of Dr. Michael  Collins. For more than 25 years, he has exhibited a drive and work ethic on and off the ice  that serves as  inspiration  to his colleagues  and friends.  Dr. Collins, a Chicago native, attended the  University of Notre Dame. In South Bend he  played varsity hockey and shoveled furnaces  to pay the bills, but still graduated in three and  a half years. Upon graduation, Michael spent  several years driving a cab, and working construction before entering medicine. After  returning to college for another two years to take  pre-med courses, he attended the Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine followed by  five years at the Mayo Clinic. He is now a full-  time, board-certified orthopedic surgeon.  In addition to his medical practice, he has  written professionally for more than 30 years.  His  first book, Hot Lights, Cold Steel, continues to be a best-seller in the medical memoir field. Since its publication, Michael has lectured extensively on  topics relating  to medicine and writing.  Dr. Collins’ hard work and accomplishments  have earned him national attention, and  in  2010  he  received  the  American Hockey  Coaches Association Lou Lamoriello Award.  The Lamoriello Award  recognizes a  former  college hockey player or coach who goes on  to a distinguished career in or out of hockey.  Michael and his wife, Patti, have raised 12  children and today he still plays hockey twice  a week. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to  join me in recognizing Dr. Michael Collins and  his  life of achievement. His career has  inspired many and continues to impress.  f  RECOGNIZING TIFFANY MCKINNIE  AS THE 2011 WASHINGTON COUNTY EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT PERSON OF THE YEAR  HON.

230,156,2011-02-16,Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Oscar Price Jr.  Mr. Price who was born in Robinsonville, MS  on July 24, 1953 to the late Oscar, Sr. and  Dora. Encouraged by his parents, Oscar Jr.,  learned the value of education at an early age.  Oscar attended  school at Christian Spring  Church where he was taught by the late Edna  Pullam Carpenter. Soon after, Oscar attended  school at Shallow Baptist Church and  later  transferred to Rosa Fort Elementary during the  early 60s. Price  furthered his education, attended grade school, middle school, and completed his coursework in 1972. He worked on  farms and returned to school to graduate from  Rosa Fort High School, Class of 73. Oscar  completed various technical courses and educational training to advance in a competitive  job market.  Oscar, at an early age, confessed Christ at  Good Hope #1 Baptist Church under the leadership of Reverend R. Douglas. Price participated in various church activities that taught  good morals, sound values, and respect  for  others. Price earned the role of becoming a  junior deacon at his church. He served his  church family and community through volunteering and participating in events. Later, Price  became a Deacon at Good Hope where he  continues to worship. In addition, to this spiritualistic  accomplishment,  Price  has  now  served as the Chairman of the Deacon Board  for over twenty years.  Oscar’s employment career began on local  farms. Later, he became a student bus driver.  Leaving high school in December 1972, Oscar  was employed as a laborer at Amax Aluminum  in Hernando, MS. Price was promoted to the  maintenance department. Shortly after  that  promotion, Price’s hard work paid off. He was  promoted to one of the few tool and die repairmen. Price later ended his employment journey at Amax and began employment at Texas  Gas Transmission  in 1978. Oscar continued  his work at Texas Gas Transmission as a  maintenance man and plant operator. Price recently retired after 32 years of employment at  Texas Gas Transmission.

232,3,2011-03-01,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, by recklessly slashing more than $60 billion  from the budget, the Republican majority is trying to assume the mantle of  fiscal responsibility. Yes, fiscal. Sometimes we  in politics have problems  with pronunciations, and sometimes we  have problems with concepts. There are  two  ‘‘fiscals.’’ There  is the  ‘‘fiscal’’  dealing with dollars, F-I-S-C-A-L, and  there is the ‘‘physical,’’ P-H-Y-S-I-C-A-  L. They are trying to assume the mantle of fiscal responsibility.  Within the $60 billion, there are certainly some cuts that should be made  that would be cost effective, and there  are other cuts that weren’t made that  should have been made from the Defense Department, farm subsidies and  other places. Many of the programs  that were cut or that were severely underfunded are programs that have a  significant  financial  return.  In  fact,  many of these underfunded or eliminated programs actually save the government  far more money than they  cost.  Penny wise and pound foolish.  So the Republican claims that they  are  saving  the Federal Government  more than $60 billion is simply untrue.  Yes, they are eliminating $60 billion  from the budget, but in reality they  are increasing the deficit in other areas  that do not appear in the budget—or  certainly not this year.  As Paul Krugman would say: Eat the  future or lose the future. They’re not  concerned about the future. It’s about  today; and if it’s the future, it’s the  2012 election.  The problem is that the Republicans’  so-called ‘‘budget hawks’’ fail to look  at  this holistically. The only costs  they see are numbers on a page that  they want to hold up as talking points.  b1020  This slide shows some of the cuts.  The Food and Drug Administration received funding $241 million below 2010  and $400 million below the administration’s 2011 budget request. That’s the  Food and Drug Administration. Remember thalidomide babies? Remember Fen-Phen? Remember the problems  with meat, chicken, poultry, and spinach?  Food Safety and Inspection Service:  It makes cuts of $88 million below the  2010  funding  levels and  $107 million  below the administration’s 2011 budget  request.  The National  Institutes of Health:  Cuts appropriations for the NIH by $1.6  billion below FY 2010 and $2.5 billion  below  the President’s  budget. You  know  the  National  Institutes  of  Health—they’re trying to find cures for  Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s and diabetes and cancer. Oh, let’s cut them by  $1.6 billion.  Clean drinking water: The Republican bill slashes the Clean Water and  Drinking Water State Revolving Fund  by 56 percent. EPA: The bill includes  an undesignated $300 million recision  to EPA.  Medicare: Cuts appropriations for the  Centers  for Medicare  and Medicaid  Services by $458 million below fiscal  year 2010 and $634 million below the  President’s budget request.  However, what they  failed to consider are the benefits associated with  these costs, many of which generally  exceed the cost. And by failing to consider money saved, the Republicans are  increasing the deficit and  increasing  cost.  Nowhere is this failure in fiscal policy more apparent than when it comes  to the physical health of the American  people. The Republican’s  continuing  resolution will increase the deficit dramatically as a result of unseen health  care costs associated with the degradation of the air we breathe, the water we  drink, and the food we eat.  Now the physical impact of the Republican cuts. The FDA: $241 million.  The Republican majority is working to  undo this historic improvement and reduce food safety by cutting FDA’s food  safety programs by about $241 million.  In the United States, an estimated 76  million people get sick each year with  food-borne illnesses and 5,000 die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention. All of  the  medical costs and economic losses associated with food-borne illnesses add  up to a staggering price of $152 billion,  says the Pew Charitable Trusts. By  slashing funding from the FDA’s food  safety programs, more and more people  will get sick, and the $152 billion annual pricetag is going to climb even  higher. That doesn’t sound like a responsible physical or fiscal policy to  me.  Clean water: Although more than 70  percent of  the Earth  is covered  in  water, only about 1 percent of all the  water on the planet is safe to drink.  H.R. 1 will reduce that 1 percent by allowing major corporations and developers to pump toxins into our water,  and by failing to invest in the necessary  infrastructure  to maintain,  treat, and deliver safe drinking water.  It reduces the Drinking Water State  Revolving Fund by 56 percent, a program that leverages significant private  finances by providing low and no-interest loans to States to fund drinking  water  infrastructure  improvement  projects.  Leaking  pipes  and  deteriorating  mains lead to costly bacteria contamination and cause chronic health problems to thousands of Americans.  As you can see, the physical health of  our Nation  is being threatened, not  just the fiscal health. We need to be  concerned about the physical health of  our children and be concerned about  how the long-term effects of this will  be.  f  A TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN  STEVE HORN  ",2011

Steve Horn was without a doubt one  of  the most  intelligent and accomplished Members to ever serve in this  body, and at the same time, Mr. Speaker, he was one of the kindest and most  decent Members. He got his bachelor’s  degree from Stanford University, his  master’s from Harvard, and went back  and got his Ph.D. at Stanford University. He served in strategic intelligence  in the early 1950s in the U.S. Army Reserve, and then he got involved in public service in a big way. He served in  the Eisenhower administration, and he  went on to become legislative assistant  to California Senator Tom Kuchel.  From that point  forward, he dedicated himself to public service, and he  expanded that greatly. He got into education, and  for nearly  two decades,  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:41 Mar 01, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K01MR7.005 H01MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

Will the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. DUNCAN) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge  of Allegiance.  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee led the  Pledge of Allegiance as follows:  I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the  United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,  indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  f  THANKING PAT KELLY FOR HER 54  YEARS  OF  SERVICE  TO  THE  HOUSE  (Mr. BOEHNER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2011
237,11,2011-03-01,Mr. BOEHNER.," What helps make the  People’s House so special is its people.  Every day, the staff members here give  their time and energy not just doing  the job, but fulfilling the mission of  keeping this body closest to the American people.  Members come and go, but some dedicated  public  servants  connect  the  House’s history to its future. Pat Kelly  is a shining example of this.  Like many Americans, Pat joined the  family business right out of college.  She went to work for her mother, Congresswoman Edna Kelly, who was the  first woman to represent Brooklyn. Pat  went on to serve as a legislative assistant for other members of the New York  delegation and the Rules Committee.  For more than 30 years now, Pat has  had a bird’s-eye view of the House as  editor of the Daily Digest of the CONGRESSIONALRECORD. The Digest serves  as the  ‘‘table of contents’’  for each  day’s proceedings on the House floor  and in all of the committees. And Pat’s  job is a daily feat of precision—and patience—that requires pulling together  information from dozens of offices. And  I know all of Pat’s colleagues admire  her thoughtfulness and attention to detail.  Today she is retiring after 54 years of  service to this  institution. And  it’s  clear that Pat has not merely recorded  the House’s history—she’s been a rich  part of it, too.  When the House paid tribute to Edna  Kelly in 1998, Pat was quoted as saying  of her mother that she was a great person to emulate. Well, let the same be  said of Pat, and may all current and future public servants be inspired by her  example.  Pat, we’re sorry to see you go. On behalf of all the Members of the House  and staff, thank you for the dedication  to this institution, and thank you for  your service.  f  HONORING PAT KELLY  (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2011
238,11,2011-03-01,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  pleased  to  join  the Speaker of  the  House to honor a committed public  servant, a woman of this House, a key  thread  in the  fabric of the congressional staff, who retires today after 54  years of service: Pat Kelly. Fifty-four  years of service.  Since arriving as a committee staffer  in 1957, Pat Kelly has worked behind  the scenes on behalf of the American  people—never asking  for recognition,  never looking for the limelight.  The  daughter  of  Congresswoman  Edna Kelly, Pat said she came to Washington because, in her words, ‘‘I just  felt the urge to do something.’’ And for  more than half a century, she did far  more than her fair share.  Pat Kelly has served in many roles  on Capitol Hill. In all, she helped Members to do their jobs and worked tirelessly on issues important to her and  critical to our country’s future.  Few issues played a larger role for  her than the fight for women’s rights.  In 1962, she helped her mother pass the  first equal pay bill and watched with  pride as President John F. Kennedy  signed it into law.  As a legislative aide to former Congresswoman Martha  Griffiths,  Pat  fought for the Equal Rights Amendment—continuing the march for equality, advancing the cause of justice for  all women. Thank you, Pat. We’re all  in your debt.  Through it all, whether the legislation succeeded or failed, she stood by a  simple mantra:  ‘‘It’s  important  for  women to be involved.’’  For the past 22 years she has served  as editor of the House Daily Digest,  tracking committee activities and getting the word out on what’s happening  on Capitol Hill. In that role she has  noted, ‘‘I’ve been through the turnover  to Republicans and back to Democrats,  and tried to help each and every one of  them do their jobs.’’  Helping others do their jobs, working  in a bipartisan way—this was the essence of Pat Kelly’s career and service.  Pat Kelly’s  54 years  serving  the  House of Representatives is a reflection  of her own dedication to Congress and  the country, and represents the commitment, devotion to duty, and passion  for service of all of our congressional  staffers.  Thank you, Pat, for giving so much  to the House, for all of your work, and  for fulfilling your promise to ‘‘do something’’ for all Americans.  Yes, I join the Speaker in saying you  will be missed. We are sorry that you  are leaving. We wish you much success  and, with deep gratitude, send you our  love and best wishes.  f  MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE  A message from the Senate by Ms.  Curtis, one of  its clerks, announced  that the Senate has agreed to the following resolution:  S.

241,19,2011-03-01,Mr. DICKS.," So, again,  it was the  Democratic Congress that cut the $41  billion. And every reputable economist  says what you did in H.R. 1 is going to  have a negative effect on the economy.  And so I hope you all think carefully  about what you’re about to do.  Again, it takes compromise. You’ve  got to work with the other body to  come up with a reasonable solution  here, or we’re going to have problems  with a government shutdown. And you  can say whatever you want, but we  don’t need the government shutting  down when we’re in two wars, a war in  Afghanistan and a war in Iraq, and a  global war on terror. We don’t need to  shut the government down.  b1310  ",2011
242,19,2011-03-01,Mr. WOODALL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 30 seconds only to say that’s  why we’re here  today, as  the gentleman knows, so that there is no government shutdown. And I could not be  more proud that we’re here taking that  responsibility exactly as seriously as it  is.  It’s very difficult to have a conversation about jobs when we have carbon  regs coming down the pipe that will destroy jobs and we have financial regulations coming down the pipe that will  destroy jobs and we have health care  regs coming down the pipe that will destroy  jobs over and over again. My  folks are saying ‘‘enough.’’  With that, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from  California (Mr. DREIER), the chairman  of the Rules Committee, the gentleman  that I give credit to for giving us the  most open process on a continuing resolution  that we’ve  seen  in modern  times.  Mr.  yield?  ",2011
243,19,2011-03-01,Mr. WOODALL., I yield to the gentleman from Washington.  ,2011
244,19,2011-03-01,Mr. DICKS., That was a good process.  I appreciate what you all did in having  an open rule. I applaud Chairman ROGERSand Chairman DREIER. That is the  right thing to do. It was appreciated on  both sides of the aisle.  ,2011
245,19,2011-03-01,Mr. WOODALL., And we could not  have done it without your support.  ,2011
246,19,2011-03-01,Mr. DICKS., I did my best to help.  (Mr. DREIER asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ,2011
247,19,2011-03-01,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker,  let me  just say, I was going to begin by saying  that both my colleagues, Mr. ROGERS  and Mr. DICKS, did an absolutely phenomenal job at taking on the responsibility that is thrust on them when we  have an open amendment process.  DICKS. Will  the  gentleman  The people who go through the greatest challenge are those who have to defend the bill and be here for hours and  hours and hours. And as we all know,  we had 162 amendments considered on  the House floor during those days that  led up to before adjournment week before  last. And we worked  into  the  morning  on  every  occasion.  That  means after midnight. I mean, I guess  we adjourned at 2 or 3 on some of those  days. I was sound asleep then, I have to  admit. But you guys were working  very, very hard, Mr. Speaker. And I  want to thank them.  And I was pleased that those in the  minority did recognize that doing what  we did was unprecedented. Never before  has a continuing resolution been considered under the process that we’ve  had. At best,  it’s been a structured  rule, which is what we had two decades  ago, and both political parties had had  usually a closed rule for the consideration of continuing resolutions up to  that point. So I do believe that we have  come together with, as Mr. WOODALL  has  said,  a  package  that  included  amendments  from both sides of the  aisle as we proceed with this.  Now, I was tickled also to hear my  friend talk about the fact that $41 billion in cuts were made under Democratic leadership. The fact that both  sides of the aisle are now talking about  and bragging about ways to cut spending is, I think, a very encouraging sign,  because that is the message. That’s the  message that Mr. WOODALLwas just offering. The constant expansion of government is, in fact, counterproductive  in our quest to create jobs and get the  economy moving.  Now, we had this exchange last night  in  the Rules Committee—yesterday  afternoon in the Rules Committee, Mr.  Speaker,  in which we were  talking  about Mark Zandi and the Goldman  Sachs projections as  far as bringing  about spending reductions.  And I brought to the fore one of the  most brilliant economists I know, John  Taylor, who is at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, former undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, a very good personal  friend of mine. His son used to work in  our office. He’s serving in the United  States Marine Corps. And I’ve got to  say, Mr. Speaker, that John Taylor, in  responding to the Zandi quote, made it  very clear that the notion of not bringing about spending reductions would in  fact  exacerbate  the  economic  challenges that we have. And the bottom  line is: The best way for us to get our  economy growing is to ensure that people can keep more of their hard-earned  money and to restrict the kind of control that the Federal Government has  continued to thrust on individuals.  I’d be happy to yield to my friend if  he would like to share one of those  quotes.  ",2011
248,19,2011-03-01,Mr. DICKS.," Let me just make a brief  comment.  And I do applaud the gentleman from  California as chairman of the Rules  Committee for giving, for working out  that modified open rule.  Just let me, on the point about Mr.  Taylor at Stanford, Stanford’s a very  good school. My son graduated from it,  and I’m quite proud of that.  A letter signed by 300 of America’s  leading economists makes the argument  that cutting  investments  this  quickly will undermine growth. Among  the  original  signers  from Stanford  alone: Kenneth Arrow, Martin Carnoy,  Paul David, Mordecai Kurz, Roger Noll,  and Gavin Wright.  ",2011
249,19,2011-03-01,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, if I could  reclaim my time, I would say to my  friend I think what we’ve just shown is  that the proverbial economists say on  one hand, on the other hand.  The  fact  is not  every  economist  agrees on this notion, but a statement  has been made. And, in fact, my friend  made it upstairs, and that is, he said  when he was quoting Mark Zandi, that  everyone, basically every economist—  and that is what I inferred from the  statement—came  to  this conclusion.  And my point in actually referencing  Professor Taylor is that there is disagreement on it.  I happen to come down on the side,  personally, of Mr. Taylor. I think it’s  important for us, just because we want  to all encourage individual initiative  and  responsibility,  to do everything  that we can to reduce the size and  scope and reach of government—and  that’s what the goal of H.R. 1 is—so  that we can get the economy growing.  And I believe that more incentives by  reducing that tax and regulatory burden will create  jobs, because we do  share that goal. I mean, I’m convinced  that everyone wants to do that.  But this notion, I mean I’ve heard  commentators  saying  that  somehow  that Republicans  in saying that we  might see a reduction in the number of  Federal Government jobs, that we’re  not for job creation. We want people to  have good, long-term jobs in the private sector, and that’s our goal here.  This rule is a standard rule. I should  say at the outset that we wanted to  have this not a closed rule but a modified closed rule. And I know my friend  was  concerned  that his amendment  that he testified on behalf of in the  Rules Committee wasn’t made in order.  But I will tell you that we did, from  the very beginning, say to the minority  leader, Ms. PELOSI, that she, when having introduced on February 18 her substitute proposal  that basically kept  spending at 2010 levels, that we would  have made that in order and it would  have made it a modified closed rule  that we had offered, so we did do that.  We are where we are. Ensuring that  we don’t go  through a government  shutdown is something that Chairman  ROGERSand I know Mr. DICKSand all of  us  in  leadership positions, rank-and-  file Members alike, want to avoid, and  that’s why we’ve got this 2-week package that’s before us. I hope the Senate  will act so that we can do that, and  then do what we all want to make sure  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:26 Mar 02, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K01MR7.042 H01MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

251,27,2011-03-01,Mr. KINGSTON.," I thank the chairman for the time.  Madam Speaker,  I want  to make  three very important points right off  the bat:  Number one, our debt is almost at 95  percent of the GDP. It’s the highest  debt we have ever had in history. Last  year alone the deficit was $1.5 trillion.  We are borrowing 40 cents for every $1  that we spend. Now, if you and I were  doing that in our households or our  business was doing it or anybody else,  you would  say, okay, we’ve got  to  change our spending habits. But somehow there are those in Congress who  think that we can continue to defy the  laws of gravity. We have got to get our  house in order.  Number two, why are we here? We  are here because the Democrats last  year did not pass a budget, did not pass  appropriation bills, and did not complete their work on fiscal year 2011.  That’s what we’re doing. We are trying  to clean up the mess that was left to  us. And in doing that, we are mindful  of our financial situation and trying to  reduce some of the spending.  Number three, let me say this. This  bill was passed with an open rule. Indeed, I believe we had 127 votes on different amendments. Democrats and Republicans offered a myriad of amendments. Now, for those who are complaining on the floor today that they  don’t like these cuts, why didn’t they  offer their amendments on the floor a  couple of weeks ago? That would have  been the way to do this. Now, the  chairman and the Speaker have committed to have open rules throughout  this process this year, and so there will  be a lot of opportunities to go after  some of these programs. And some of  the ones that are mentioned, I think I  will support those cuts. But I just want  to emphasize that everyone has had a  bite of this apple.  Finally, let me just say this, Madam  Speaker. The Zandi report comes from  an economist, a political economist we  might say, who was the same person  who told us the stimulus bill would  work, the stimulus bill would keep us  from going to 8 percent unemployment.  We reached 10 percent. I don’t think we  need to listen to any more of his advice.  ",2011

I  sometimes  have a slip of tongue, Mr. DICKS, and  call you ‘‘chairman,’’ but I thank you  very much for this opportunity.  I want to just try to give a procedural class here today. The procedural  class  is  that  this  document  is  a  placeholder. I would hesitate to call it  a fake document, but that is what it is.  As I left my constituency, the last  words I heard were, ‘‘Don’t you all shut  down the government.’’ And I am glad  that Mr. DICKSworked hard to submit  his amendment  in  the Rules Committee.

That’s  what this is: a 2-week document so we  can do the right thing.  It needs to be very clear that before  we left in the 110th Congress, Democrats had already cut $41 billion. Now,  many say we didn’t have a budget. We  had a budget, but we had no compromise, no reconciliation, no fairness,  no concern about the American people.

272,43,2011-03-01,Ms.  ELLMERS.,"  Chairman.  I think we’ve come to the point now  where we  do need  to  discuss  that  ObamaCare is not the answer. We have  all discussed this over and over again.  I would say that it’s probably a good  reason that I was elected because I ran  on repealing it—that and cutting taxes  and cutting spending. And it all ties in  together.  Those of us who are in health care  have been aware of the need for reform  for quite some time. I think any of us  can say that we’ve seen the costs increase. We’ve seen the cost of health  care insurance increase. And yet we’ve  all felt that our hands were tied. We  didn’t know how to address it. The bureaucratic system, as my colleagues  have pointed out,  just dealing with  billing and trying to get the care for  patients alone can just take over your  office.  b1720  We have seen these things. We know  there are problems that exist, but we  all agree that it needs to be a patient-  centered,  doctor-nurse-patient  relationship that we have to be putting forward. And it has to be in the private  sector. There are ways  to do  this.  There is a role for government in it, especially when we are talking about  Medicare, Medicaid, and those who are  unfortunate. We want everyone to have  health care. But there are ways we can  address it.  It is not a health care crisis; it is a  crisis of culture. We have to change the  culture that we are dealing with. We  want  everyone  to  have  affordable  health care, and there are simple solutions we can put in place to do that.  ",2011
273,43,2011-03-01,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," I am so  glad that I called on the gentlewoman  from North Carolina and she brought  up this point, colleagues, because what  RENEEELLMERS just said is absolutely  the truth. We are not on this side of  the aisle, and those Democrats who  agree with us, we are not opposed to reforming the health insurance industry,  to eliminating abusive practices such  as canceling policies after the fact or  denying children with preexisting conditions, and that is exactly what the  gentlewoman from North Carolina was  referencing.  The pledge to repeal ObamaCare is  because in our humble opinion it is too  bad to  fix. That doesn’t mean that  when we replace it, and we may have to  do it piece by piece, bit by bit, that we  don’t incorporate some of the things in  there that most people would agree are  good, like allowing youngsters, young  adults, Mr. Speaker, to stay on the  health insurance policy of their parents until they are 26 years old. With  this economy and the destruction of  jobs because of bailouts and stimulus,  trillions of dollars that don’t work, unfortunately, our young college graduates have no job to go to; otherwise,  they would have health insurance from  their place of work. So they darn well  need to stay on their parents’ policy  until they are 26, and maybe until they  are 36 if we don’t quite get our act together and quit spending and get this  economy going.  Let me yield quickly to the gentleman from Tennessee, Dr. ROE, my  OB–GYN colleague from Tennessee.  ",2011
274,43,2011-03-01,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  When I came, as we all did, doctors,  physicians tend to look at a problem.  When a patient comes  in, the  first  thing we ask them, Dr. GINGREY: Why  are you here today? It is a fairly obvious question. It is called the chief complaint.  When I came to Washington, D.C., I  asked the same thing about the American health care system. I said: What is  the problem with the American health  care  system?  I  thought  there were  probably three.  Number one, it was too expensive.  The  cost  of health  care had  skyrocketed way above inflation so it is  way too expensive to come see a doctor  or go to the hospital.  The  second  issue  I  saw you  just  brought up was that there was a segment of our population  that didn’t  have access to affordable health insurance coverage. These are not the very  poor who had access in my State to  TennCare or in other States to Medicaid, but these are folks who are out  working. Maybe they are a carpenter  and their wife stays at home. Or maybe  they have a  job, a  small business,  where they can’t afford it. So there was  that segment that didn’t have it.  Lastly, there is a liability crisis in  America. Our friends on the other side,  our trial lawyer friends can tend to say  that is not the case, but let me give  you a personal example. When I started  my medical practice, probably about  the same time you did, Dr. GINGREY, it  cost $360. That was the first baby I delivered in 1977 that I got paid for. I was  out of the Army and out of my training, $360. My first year’s salary was  $32,000. That is what I made my first  year in practice. I delivered 260 babies  that year; a lot of babies. The next  year I was up to $60,000 a year. My malpractice was $4,000 a year. When I came  to Congress  2 years ago,  the malpractice in Tennessee for an obstetrician was $74,000. And there is no value  that we get, that patients get  from  that. We will go into that when we  have another hour.  But the thing about the ObamaCare  plan that bothered me was it did nothing to bend the cost curve.  If you  looked at this and if you look at plans  that have been out there in the past,  Medicare, for instance, came on board  in 1965 as a $3 billion program; $3 billion in 1965.  The estimators, there was no Congressional Budget Office then or folks  who make  these estimates, but  the  government estimators at that time  said in 25 years this will be a $15 billion  program. The actual number was over  $100 billion. And today it is over $500  billion.  In Tennessee, we noticed we had the  same problem 20 years ago. We have  been through all of this before. Unfortunately, no one here chose to listen to  us in our Doctors Caucus. We said we  had lack of access and we had prices  rising back in the 1990s, the early 1990s,  exactly the same debate that we are  having today except today it is more  severe than it was.  We spent $2.6 billion on TennCare in  1993. In 2004, 2005, just 10 budget years  later, it was up to $8.5 billion. The cost  had tripled.  So when you  see  these cost estimates—and remember that the same  CBO, and these are good folks. I’m not  pointing the finger at them. It is very  hard to do what they do. They are  given a set of data. They crunch the  numbers and they hand them to us.  They only missed this year’s budget  deficit by $400 billion in 1 year. So I am  to stand here and believe, looking at  these other examples I have just given  you, that this is going to be budget  neutral in 10 years? There is no way it  will be.  I know we have a lot to discuss. I’m  sorry I was a little late. I had some  folks from the great University of Tennessee in my office to see. I look forward to continuing this discussion.  ",2011
275,43,2011-03-01,Mr. GINGREY of Georgia.," Dr. ROE,  we appreciate you being with us.  I  know the time is rapidly coming to a  close.  But, Mr. Speaker, I guess the last  slide basically says it all, cuts right to  the chase: ObamaCare steals Americans’ liberty. Our forefathers intended  certain basic rights—life, liberty, pursuit of happiness—to be inalienable—  that means can’t be taken away from  you—and  consider  them  self-evident  and universal.  ObamaCare lets the boss steal liberty  from every American by forcing them  to buy health insurance whether they  want it or need it or not. We can encourage them to have it and try to  make it possible and affordable. But to  force them to do it, the next thing we  know, everybody will be eating broccoli by government edict because it is  healthy, it is healthy food. They are  going to have a hard time getting me  to eat broccoli.  But I am telling you the judge in  Florida, Judge Vincent, and the judge  in  the Commonwealth  of Virginia,  Judge Hudson, they got it right. We  need  expedited  processing  of  those  suits so the Supreme Court will tell the  American people  this  is unconstitutional and will not stand.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back  the balance of my time.

277,59,2011-03-01,Mr. PASCRELL.," Madam Speaker, I  would like you to take back to your  side—and I’ll take back to my side—  that I know this has been a great leverage issue for the Republican Party. It  has been a third rail for the Democratic Party. We were told basically, in  so many words, to stay away from it.  Look, let’s lay our cards on the table.  I think that this is something we can  agree to come together on common  ground and be a little bit more reasonable about our approach.  I thank you, Congresswoman MCCARTHY, for leading the way, as usual. You  know I will always be there in support  of what I think is very important legislation for the sanity of our country.  Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. And I  thank you again.  I just want to remind the American  people who might be listening tonight,  I need your help. I can do the battles  here. It’s so easy to email your Member  of Congress or your Senator to say it’s  time to get rid of the large magazines,  because there is no place in America  anymore that is safe. This can happen  anytime, any place. So I thank you for  listening to me tonight, and I thank  my friend for standing here with me  and talking about it.  I will say, in closing, it’s 17 years  since the incident happened to my family. There is not a day that goes by  that I don’t remember what happened,  and that’s why I continue to fight for  this issue. I don’t want another family  to go through the pain. I don’t want to  see another person die. I don’t want to  see someone  injured  for the rest of  their life, and to fight those battles.  ",2011
278,59,2011-03-01,Ms. ESHOO.," Madam Speaker, in the wake  of the horrible tragedy in Arizona, Members of  Congress were united in condemning the violence. We expressed our prayers and hopes  for the recovery of our colleague, Congresswoman GABRIELLEGIFFORDS, and the others  injured in the attack, and we praised the heroic actions of ordinary Americans on that day.  But for our words to have meaning, Madam  Speaker, we also must act.  I’m proud  to  join Representative CAROLYN  MCCARTHY in introducing the Large Capacity  Ammunition Feeding Device Act, to eliminate  access to clips that enable the kind of shooting spree that took place in Arizona. No one  can say that the ability to shoot more than ten  times—without pausing to reload—makes our  cities or our citizens any safer. The Assault  Weapons Ban of 1994 addressed this issue,  but perversely, by allowing it to expire in 2004,  we lost critical ground.  The importance of the ban was tangible in  each of our communities. When I first came to  Congress, East Palo Alto, a city in my district,  bore the awful distinction of being the ‘‘Murder  Capital of the Country.’’ Today, the crime rate  has subsided. The ability to take these murderous assault weapons off the street played  a major role in that turnaround, and we should  not turn back the clock.  Madam Speaker, we all honor our Constitution and the Second Amendment. I, however,  see no connection between the primitive muskets our Founding Fathers contemplated and  the sophisticated, deadly weapons that plague  our streets today. The United States continues  to have the most per-capita gun deaths of any  developed nation. This is not a symbol of our  freedom. It’s a capacity to kill, and this must  not eclipse our capacity to care. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this sensible  gun legislation which we are grateful to Representative MCCARTHY for authoring to better  protect our communities.  ",2011
279,59,2011-03-01,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Madam Speaker, I rise  to join the vast majority of Americans, on both  sides of the gun debate, who want a safe and  sensible gun policy for their families and for  the United States of America.  In  the aftermath of  the  recent  tragedy  in  Tucson, one eminently  reasonable place  to  start—one place where gun rights advocates  and gun control advocates should be able to  find common ground—is  the Large Capacity  Ammunition Feeding Device Act (H.R. 308),  introduced by my colleague Rep. CAROLYN  MCCARTHY(D–NY).  H.R. 308 is not about gun control. Instead,  it’s about commonsense ammunition control.  The Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act sets aside all of the historically contentious debate around gun ownership and instead asks every American a very simple  question: Is it really necessary for non-law enforcement civilians to have access to high capacity, 33-round magazines like the one Jared  Lee Loughner used  to shoot our colleague  GABBYGIFFORDSand his other victims in Tucson?  I would submit that it is not. And I would further submit that the overwhelming majority of  Americans and law abiding gun owners would  agree that it is not. Consistent with that commonsense conclusion, the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act would simply ban  the sale or  transfer of high-capacity magazines holding more than ten rounds. Law enforcement records show  that  the number of  high capacity magazines retrieved by police at  crime scenes dropped significantly  the  last  time this kind of restriction was in effect, and  common sense  tells you  that smaller magazines with less bullets will lead to less fatalities  and injuries during these kinds of horrific attacks.  Madam Speaker,  this  is not a partisan  issue. This is an American issue.

293,91,2011-03-01,Mr. VITTER.," Madam President, I rise  in strong support of the Toomey-Vitter  amendment, which we will vote on in  the series of two votes starting at 5  p.m. The  idea behind  the Toomey-  Vitter amendment is very simple. It  says if we ever reach the debt ceiling,  the government, as a top first priority,  will use revenue to pay two things:  first, proper interest payments on our  U.S. Government debt; and secondly,  Social Security checks to seniors.  The motivation behind this amendment is simple. First, those two things  should be legitimately a top priority.  No one should want the U.S. Government to default on its debt and no one  should want the immediate stoppage,  or the stoppage at any time, of Social  Security checks to seniors. So first, it  is legitimate to rank those two functions as an absolute top priority.  The second motivation behind this  amendment is to take some of these  scare tactics and hysteria out of this  debate. Too many people, in my opinion, have been saying if we ever reach  the debt ceiling, the next day all Social  Security checks will stop and all payments will  stop  on U.S. Treasury  bills—on government debt. That is not  true. There is no reason it has to be  true. This amendment, when passed  into law, will ensure it is not true. It  will ensure we look at this situation  with  focus  and  calmness  and  not  hysteria and scare tactics.  The goal, I am certain—and I know it  is  for Senator TOOMEY, my  distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania—  is not that we not default on our debt  and not that we reach the debt ceiling,  but it is that we take strong, responsible action well ahead of any threatened event to put us on a fiscally sustainable path.  Just  this morning,  both Senator  TOOMEYand I were in a hearing of the  Senate Banking Committee and  the  witness—the  only witness—was Ben  Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve. He  said very clearly  several  things directly  pertinent  to  this  discussion.  First, he said we are on a  fiscally  unsustainable path. Our budget situation is absolutely unsustainable. Second, he said that is the biggest long-  term threat to our economy—the biggest threat. Third, he said that although it is a long-term problem, it  could create a  short-term crisis.  It  could create a crisis that could hit immediately, at any time. So we need to  act and we need to act strongly.  Madam President, I yield time to the  distinguished Senator  from Pennsylvania.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.  ",2011

302,91,2011-03-01,Mr. TOOMEY.," Madam President, I  wish  to  thank Senator VITTER for  yielding his time and for his help on  this effort. I want to be very clear.  First, I am not aware of anybody in  this body or anybody I know who wants  to see a government shutdown. I am  not aware of anybody who wants to see  the disruption that would result from  failing to raise the debt ceiling at the  appropriate  time.  But  I  also  feel  strongly it is critical we take this opportunity to begin to address the structural problems we have.  The fact is we have a burden of debt  right now that is costing us jobs in this  country today. The uncertainty it creates, the cost of  financing this, the  question of whether and for how long  we can roll this over, the extent to  which inflation becomes a problem, all  of these risk factors are already weighing on our economy and our ability to  create jobs now. For the future, it is an  even bigger risk.  Senator VITTERand I have taken this  step so we can have an honest discussion about how we are going to bring  this spending under control and the  process reforms we are going to make  so we  can  hopefully  get  off  this  unsustainable path and get on a sustainable trajectory  for the economic  growth we need. That  is ultimately  what this measure is all about. It simply says that in the event we reach the  debt  limit without having  raised  it  first—and let’s face it, we have been  there before. This has happened in the  past. In the last 20 years, it has happened on several occasions. So it is entirely possible that, despite the best efforts of those of us who want to avoid  it, it could happen again.  If it were to happen again, we want  to make sure that we have no default  on our debt, that interest is paid, and  that Social Security checks go to the  recipients as they should. There will be  plenty of resources from ongoing tax  revenue to make sure that happens,  and anything less would be very irresponsible.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of this amendment.  DAMAGESLANGUAGE  ",2011
303,91,2011-03-01,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Madam President,  I commend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his hard work in  putting  together  this  managers’  amendment and building consensus for  this bill. Part of the managers’ amendment strikes most of section 4 of the  bill, relating to damages. As the chairman knows, I worked very hard on the  ‘‘gatekeeper’’ damages language in this  section of the bill. That language represented a compromise between high-  technology companies, many located in  my State of California, which believed  that the law relating to patent damages needed reform, and other interests,  including universities, biotech,  pharmaceutical companies, and small  inventors, who were greatly concerned  that the preferred solution of the high-  technology companies, namely apportionment of damages, would be destructive to the value of patents. However, since then, the courts have further developed the law relating to damages, so I understand that the chairman proposes to now strike the gatekeeper damages language from the bill.  ",2011
304,91,2011-03-01,Mr. LEAHY.," Yes, the Senator is correct. I thank her for her hard work in  putting together the gatekeeper damages  language with Senator Specter  and myself in committee last Congress.  It was instrumental in helping to move  this bill forward. However, as the Senator  from California  recognizes,  the  courts have advanced the law regarding  damages since then. For example, in  Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., decided just this year, the Federal Circuit held that expert testimony regarding a ‘‘rule of thumb’’ for allocating  profits between a patent user and a  patent owner did not meet the Daubert  test for expert testimony, and was inadmissible.

305,99,2011-03-01,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, I take  this opportunity to honor the memory  of  a  very  special man, Frederick  ‘‘Fred’’ Hill of Sonoma County, who  died on February 9, 2011. He was 75  years old.  Fred Hill was a man of many talents  and will be fondly remembered for his  diverse work  in  the  literary world.  Born in Philadelphia, PA, Fred went on  to attend Brown University. Following  graduation, Fred served in the Army  before getting a  job as a travelling  textbook  salesman with Knopf. He  later worked  for Little, Brown as a  Western States salesman and then as  head of the company’s international division. Throughout this transformative  time of travel and networking, Fred realized his gift: he  loved writers, he  loved publishers, and he was uniquely  gifted in his ability to interact with  and explain one to the other.  Fred relocated to the San Francisco  Bay area in the late 1970s. In 1979, after  5 years as general manager at Sierra  Club Books, he rented an office on  Union Street and opened his own agency, which is now run by his business  partner, Bonnie Nadell. Fred remained  on Union Street, in one office or another, until he decided to move his  business to Glen Ellen, where he resided with his partner, Peter Gilliam.  The job of a literary agent is all encompassing, as their success depends  on their client’s success. Authors bestow a great deal of trust to their  agents, and  I know personally  that  Fred Hill was an outstanding agent. He  was able to be encouraging and yet be  critical where warranted.  Fred worked diligently to advance  the products and interests of his clients, and could always be counted on  to excite virtually anyone about a client’s book. Fred’s clients ranged from  best-selling  novelist Richard North  Patterson to nonfiction writer Michael  Murphy. He also worked with an extensive  list  of  food writers,  including  Carol  Field,  Hubert  Keller,  David  Lebovitz, and Gerald Hirigoyen.  Those who knew Fred Hill recognized  him as a uniquely innovative and brilliant man. His work  in the  literary  world will be remembered fondly by all  those whose lives he touched. He will  be deeply missed.  Fred is survived by his partner of 31  years, Peter Gilliam.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO SUE ROUST  ∑Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.  President, today I recognize a devoted  and dedicated public servant  in my  home State  of South Dakota. Sue  Roust has served as Minnehaha County  auditor for five terms and is retiring.  During her tenure of public service in  Minnehaha County, the number of registered voters in the county has grown  from 75,000 to over 108,000. She has effectively managed 24 county elections  as well as Sioux Falls city and school  elections. In total, she has overseen the  counting of over 1.3 million ballots.  Additionally, Sue manages the accounting functions for the county. During her 20 years of service, the county  budget has quadrupled. She has provided oversight and counsel on a number of important issues impacting the  county. She has also utilized her position as county auditor to educate the  general public on numerous issues. She  has maintained a high level of professionalism and commitment to community service during her two decades of  service.  In addition to her elected service,  Sue has served in various leadership  capacities for many community organizations,  including  the PTA, Boy  Scouts, Girl Scouts, United Way, the  Sioux Falls Washington High School  Booster Club, the Dow Rummel Village  board of trustees, the Sioux Falls Business and Professional Women, and the  First Congregational Church. She currently  serves  on  the  board  of  Here4Youth,  an  organization which  provides day  care and out-of-school  care to children ages 3–21 with a special  emphasis  on  children with  special  needs.  I commend Sue for her great dedication and commitment to the people of  Minnehaha County and the State of  South Dakota. She  can  take great  pride in her service. I want to wish Sue  and her family all the best in retirement and good luck in all future endeavors.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO THE DOLAN-JUSTICE  FAMILY  ∑Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr.  President, today I wish to pay tribute  to  the Dolan-Justice  family on  the  100th anniversary of owning the Grant  County Review of Milbank, SD. This  occasion highlights the Dolan-Justice  family commitment to the newspaper  industry and to the Grant County community.  On February 11, 1911, 24-year-old William S. Dolan  acquired  the Grant  County Review. This started a 46-year  adventure as editor of the small town  weekly newspaper. In a time with virtually no access to television or radio,  the  local  newspaper was  the  only  source of news for small town South  Dakota. With no experience  in news  media, William quickly  learned  the  ropes. The Grant County Review became a family affair. William’s wife,  Christine Olson, was a trusted adviser  to the paper, and his sister-in-law, Victoria Olson, even set the type on the  linograph machine  by  hand. While  other surrounding newspapers  folded,  William’s accounting background and  hard work enabled the Grant County  Review to continue through the 20th  century. A fierce rivalry began between  the Grant County Review and the Herald Review, pitting each paper against  each other for advertisers and breaking  news stories. Often Dolan and the editor of the Herald Review would trade  blows in the editorial section of their  papers.  Sticking with the  family tradition  for  journalism, William’s  daughter  Phyllis pursued a journalism degree at  South Dakota State University and the  University  of Minnesota. She  then  came back to write for the paper and  help her father run the day-to-day activities. The family paper soon hired a  printer,  Clarence  Justice.  Clarence  worked for many papers before coming  to the Grant County Review, including  the Miller Gazette,  the  Interlakes  Daily, and the Miller Press. After William S. Dolan passed away, his family  took over operation of the Grant County Review, with his wife Christine  served as the new publisher, and his  daughter Phyllis as the new editor.  William always fought for small business and rural farmers, and served as  the president for the Board of Regents,  overseeing South Dakota’s public universities. In 1962, William S. Dolan was  elected to the South Dakota Newspaper  Hall of Fame.  In  1982, Phyllis was  elected as the first female president of  the South Dakota Press Association,  and in 1988 she joined her father in the  South Dakota Newspaper Hall of Fame.  Phyllis’  boundary  breaking  honors  serve as an inspiration to women in  journalism. Clarence and Phyllis both  received distinguished service awards  for their work in journalism for the  South Dakota Newspaper Association.  In 1997, the Grant County Review received the distinguished Bishop Dudley  award from the Diocese of Sioux Falls,  for Clarence and Phyllis’ dedication to  integrity  and  religious  values. The  Grant County Review has the largest  readership of any weekly newspaper in  the State. This achievement highlights  the incredible devotion this family and  the paper’s employees have to the responsibility of disseminating the news.  I am proud to honor the Dolan-Justice  family on reaching this hallmark, and  on being reliable, responsible members  of the journalism community.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE  At 10:40 a.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that that House has passed the  following bills, in which it requests the  concurrence of the Senate:  H.R. 347.

ED WHITFIELD  OFKENTUCKY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2011  ",2011
307,123,2011-03-01,Mr. WHITFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to speak about  legislation  I have  introduced  that will reinforce our Nation’s commitment to  combating prescription drug abuse by  reauthorizing the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act, NASPER,  for  three additional years.  On August 11, 2005, NASPER was signed  into law to assist States in combating prescription drug abuse of  controlled  substances,  through  prescription  drug monitoring  programs, PDMPs. NASPER is administered by  the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, and provides grants to States to  establish and improve prescription drug monitoring programs.  Just last week, the head of the Office of National  Drug  Control  Policy, ONDCP, Gil  Kerlikowske, embarked on a three-day visit to  Kentucky where he saw firsthand the significant problems with prescription pill abuse, an  issue many in my district struggle with. It’s estimated that 82 Kentuckians die each month  as a  result of overdoses. Nationwide  there  were more than 27,000 deaths from prescription drug overdoses in 2007, a number that  has risen five-fold since 1990. These statistics  are unacceptable and a testament that more  must be done.  While Kentucky has made great  strides  through its PDMP and collaboration between  the public and private sector, illicit drugs continue to flow across our borders from States  without  PDMPs,  such  as  Florida.  Last  Wednesday, law enforcement officials from the  U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA,  conducted a massive raid in South Florida arresting 20, including five doctors, after a yearlong investigation involving trafficking of prescription pills. What’s more concerning is the  recent decision by the Governor of Florida to  repeal funding for the creation of a PDMP approved by the State legislature in 2009.  By reauthorizing the NASPER program we  will ensure States have the support they need  to address prescription drug abuse by making  NASPER grants available  for planning purposes as well as for ‘‘establishing, improving,  and maintaining’’  their  programs.  Through  these grants, States will be given resources to  help prevent patients  from doctor shopping  and abusing prescription drugs. This also will  help to ensure that appropriate law enforcement, regulatory and State professional licensing authorities have access to prescription history  information  for  the purposes of  investigating drug diversion and errant prescriber/  pharmacist prescribing and dispensing practices.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in supporting  this vital piece of  legislation and  to  push for swift passage in the House.  f  INDIAN AMERICAN CULTURAL  CENTER 9TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. PETER J.

308,123,2011-03-01,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure  to announce  that  the  Indian  American Cultural Center of NWIHRC will be  celebrating  its 9th anniversary by hosting a  gala dinner and banquet on Saturday, March  5, 2011, at  the Halls of Saint George,  in  Schererville, Indiana.  The Indian American Cultural Center, which  opened on March 9, 2002, was established  with the following goal in mind: to foster peace  and harmony amongst  the people of Northwest Indiana by showcasing their cultural heritage and creating spiritual awareness in both  youth and adults, as well as to engage in various charitable events, both nationally and locally. Since its inception, the Indian American  Cultural Center has been instrumental in educating Northwest Indiana’s citizens on the traditions and customs of the Indian heritage.  The members of the Indian American Cultural Center of NWIHRC are  to be  commended, not only for their commitment to preserving tradition, but also for their commitment  to making improvements that benefit all mankind. Proceeds  from  this year’s gala, which  throughout  the years has demonstrated  the  immense generosity of its attendees and organizers, will go to support the Carmelite Home  for Girls. In the past, proceeds from the gala  have gone to such noble causes as cancer research, educational scholarships,  the American Red Cross, and tsunami relief, as well as  to victims of Hurricane Katrina and the earthquake in Kashmir, India.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other  distinguished  colleagues  join me  in  commending the board and members of the Indian  American Cultural Center of NWIHRC for their  outstanding  contributions  to  society.  Their  commitment to improving the quality of life for  the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the world is truly inspirational and should  be recognized and commended.  f  HONORING TERRELL LIONS CLUB  HON.

309,123,2011-03-01,Mr. HENSARLING.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to recognize the outstanding service that the  Terrell Lions Club provides the communities in  Kaufman County, Texas.  Lions Club  International was  founded  in  1917 in Chicago to aid the blind and visually  impaired. The Terrell Lions Club was founded  on February 28, 1921 and was one of the first  chartered in Texas.  Since that time, the Terrell Lions Club created the Lions Club Park in 1948 on sixteen  acres of land for the National Guard Armory,  as well as two community tennis courts.  The Terrell Lions work  to eradicate blindness by providing free vision screenings, eye  examinations and glasses  for  the needy, as  well as promoting the Lions Eye Bank.  Lions contribute time, talent and resources  to  the Texas Lions Club Camp  in Kerrville,  which provides free residential camping experiences  for children with physical disabilities,  Type 1 diabetes and cancer.  This organization provides an  invaluable  service to those in the community who truly  need assistance. Over the years, thousands of  individuals and families have been blessed by  the men and women of the Terrell Lions Club.  As the Congressman for the Fifth District of  Texas, I am pleased today to recognize the  Terrell Lions Club for their 90 years of service  to Kaufman County. To all  the men and  women who give of their time and efforts so  generously, on behalf of all the constituents of  the Fifth District,  I would  like  to extend our  most sincere gratitude.  f  HONORING ITASCA FIRE CHIEF  JAMES D.

On March 31st of  this year, Mr. MacArthur will conclude his loyal  service as Fire Chief of the Itasca Fire Protection District.  Chief MacArthur has served the community  for a total of 38 years, including 8 years as  Fire Chief of the Itasca Fire Protection District  No. 1 and 15 years as Fire Chief of the Elk  Grove Village Fire Department.  Throughout  his  career,  his  extraordinary  leadership  has  earned  him  great  respect  among colleagues and members of the community. He has held many noteworthy positions,  including President of  the  Illinois Fire  Chiefs Association and the Metropolitan Fire  Chiefs Association. Along with other members  of  the  Illinois  fire service  task  force, Chief  MacArthur assisted in the Louisiana response  and relief efforts following Hurricane Katrina.  Time and time again, Chief MacArthur has  exhibited  the characteristics  this  line of duty  necessitates: enormous sacrifice and courage.  Mr. Speaker and distinguished colleagues,  please join me in celebrating this special occasion and wishing him every happiness in the  well deserved respite of his retirement.

315,44,2011-03-08,Mr. VITTER.," Madam President, I rise  to focus on another grave threat to our  economic  recovery  and  jobs:  skyrocketing energy prices, and particularly the price of gasoline at the pump.  Madam President,  I don’t have to  point out to Americans all over the  country, and Louisianans all over my  State, because they see it in front of  them every time they go get a new  tank of gas, the ever-increasing energy  prices, the ever-increasing prices at the  pump. Right now, on average, nationwide, the price at the pump is $3.51 a  gallon. That is about 80 cents higher  than the average price a year ago. Most  Americans know  it  is not  stopping  there. They  see  $4 gasoline coming  sooner  rather  than  later,  and who  knows how far it will go beyond $4 at  the pump?  This is a real threat. We are trying to  come out of the worst recession since  the Great Depression and this is an immediate threat to put the brakes on  any recovery we may be mounting, and  it is surely a real threat and a real hit  to Louisiana and American families. It  is a direct hit to their pocketbooks.  Louisianans, like all Americans, hear  talking heads on TV, national economists, saying we don’t have any real  inflation. Listen, they are hit every  time they go to the pump. They know  there is inflation in key prices such as  gasoline, and that is a big hit to their  family budget.  This has  sparked  somewhat  of  a  breakthrough in thinking among the  ranks of the Obama administration.  Let me explain what I mean by that.  Recently President Obama’s Energy  Secretary, Secretary Chu, focused on  supply and he said we need to increase  supply to temper prices and mitigate  the increasing price at the pump. He  said we need to do this by convincing  the Saudi Arabians to increase their  supply of oil on the world market:  ‘‘That’s going to mitigate the price increase.’’ He said further, ‘‘We’re hoping  market forces will take care of this.’’ I  at least give Secretary Chu and the  Obama administration marks for this  breakthrough understanding that supply is a big part of the equation. In  fact, it is half of the supply and demand equation that yields price.  Recently the White House Chief of  Staff Bill Daley made a comment that  also went to supply. He said this weekend, on  some of  the weekend  talk  shows, that we need to consider opening the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to  put more product on the market, to increase supply—also to temper prices, to  stop  these  ever-increasing  prices.  Again, I at least give Mr. Daley and the  Obama administration credit  for  finally realizing, and  it  is a bit of a  breakthrough, that supply is a big part  of the issue.  Where I disagree, where I want a further breakthrough, is that they need to  focus on domestic supply we can create  and that we can control in America.  Unfortunately, they are not doing that  yet.  I have come to the floor many times  to talk about the virtual shutdown of  the Gulf of Mexico to energy production since the BP disaster. I will mention that again because that is at the  heart of this issue. The administration  understands we need to increase supply. What about domestic supply? What  about the Gulf of Mexico? What about  all of our other vast energy resources  that we are taking off the table and  shutting down? What about that supply? That is the first place we should  turn, that is the first action we should  take. That is what can help us control  our own destiny.  Instead,  there has been a virtual  shutdown of the Gulf of Mexico to energy production. That has reduced direct and indirect employment in the  oil and gas and service industries. It  threatens  93,000  jobs  for every year  until 2035 unless we reverse it. It could  VerDate Mar 15 2010  23:36 Mar 08, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G08MR6.005 S08MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s t r e b o r s         ",2011

320,60,2011-03-08,Mr. DEMINT.," Mr. President, I have  been sitting in my office listening to  news reports about the Congress and  the President arguing about the budget  and  the debate about what we are  going to cut. It is interesting to think  back over the last couple of years, because it is hard to put these things together. After 2 years of the largest expansion of government, the biggest increase in debt in our history, now suddenly we are debating what needs to be  cut.  I think over the last couple of years  as the President proposed a massive  spending plan—which we called a stimulus—and Republicans were saying no,  that is not the way to improve the  economy. But the President insisted it  would keep unemployment below 8 percent and get our economy going again.

344,100,2011-03-08,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. President, as  someone who voted to freeze salaries,  to end earmarks in this budget process,  as someone who has already voted to  cut $45 billion from the budget, I rise  today in recognition that business as  usual cannot continue. I recognize the  critical importance of addressing our  Federal deficit—a deficit, I would add,  inherited by this administration, a deficit driven by two wars, both unpaid  for, and the unprecedented need  for  governmental action to mitigate the  wild excesses of Wall Street and American financial markets, excesses that  were effectively condoned by the last  administration, whose  policies  took  this Nation to the brink of a second  Great Depression and cost millions of  American jobs.  I never forget that time in late 2008  when Chairman Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, came before members of  the Banking Committee and members of the leadership  and described the circumstances that  were unfolding in the country in which  a series of financial institutions, according  to Chairman Bernanke and  then-Secretary Paulson, the Secretary  of  the Treasury—they  said: We are  going to have a series of financial institutions collapse, and if they collapse,  they will create systemic risk to the  entire country’s economy, and every  American will feel the consequences of  that collapse. I remember how hushed  that room was.  I remember also the question being  put to Chairman Bernanke: Surely you  must have enough tools at the Federal  Reserve to get us through this period  of time. I remember the response to  that question, which was basically:  Senator, if you and your colleagues do  not act in a matter of days, maybe a  week, we will have a global financial  meltdown, which really meant a new  depression.  Chairman Bernanke is an academician. His expertise is in depression-era  economics, how this Nation got into  the last depression, how Roosevelt got  us out of it. So when he made that  statement, it was all the more chilling.  It is from that moment in 2008, before  this President took office and Democrats were in full control here, that, in  fact, we were facing the challenges we  are today.  Those of us who believe in a free market also know you cannot have a free-  for-all market. We had economic policies for the Bush 8 years, two wars raging  abroad,  an unregulated market  that allowed for the free-for-all that  brought us on the brink of a new depression, and that is what we are meeting the challenges of today.  Those choices then and the choices  we make, what we choose to cut and  what we determine is in our interest,  will speak volumes about our values,  our priorities as a people and as a Nation.  Mr. President, I favor smart cuts, not  dangerous  ones.  In  an  independent  analysis of H.R. 1, which we are going  to be voting on tomorrow—the Republican vision of where we should take  the country—shows we are losing about  700,000 jobs. But we are trying to grow  jobs in America. We have finally gotten into positive gross domestic product of our Nation’s economy. We are  seeing job growth. I would like to see it  be even more robust, but H.R. 1 takes  us back the opposite way and threatens  the very essence of this economic recovery—700,000 jobs.  Don’t believe what I say because I  say it is so, but because those in the  know  say  it—Ben Bernanke:  ‘‘The  GOP’s plan will cut jobs.’’ Economist  Mark Zandi: ‘‘The GOP plan would cost  700,000 jobs.’’ Here is another analysis:  House  spending cuts will hurt economic growth. So what we have  is  economist after economist telling us  that H.R. 1 is a recipe for disaster when  it comes to the question of  jobs  in  America.  That analysis which says we would  slash 700,000 jobs directly impacts the  lives of middle-class and working families struggling to get back on their  feet. They are severe cuts that run  roughshod over the green shoots of economic recovery just to satisfy a political agenda. I  favor smart commonsense cuts—cuts made with a surgeon’s  knife not a meat ax; cuts that are  thoughtful, surgically precise cuts that  actually reduce the deficit, not cuts  that eliminate  jobs and disinvest  in  educational opportunities for millions  of promising young Americans, not  cuts that hurt middle-class  families  struggling to make ends meet, make  our workforce  less competitive, our  communities less safe, and strip away  basic protections Americans have come  to take for granted.  In my view, we can preserve our values and invest in the future, invest in  out-educating,  out-innovating,  out-  greening, and out-growing the world  and still cut the deficit. To begin with,  Secretary Gates of the Department of  Defense has identified $78 billion in defense spending cuts alone. He has identified $178 billion  in program reductions over 5 years, including delaying  or  terminating  high-profile weapon  systems.  I agree with Secretary Gates that we  can live without the Marine Corps variant of the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter as  well as the Marine Corps Expeditionary  Fighting Vehicle. The Secretary has  identified $54 billion in cuts in overhead  costs  and  improved  efficiency  across defense agencies and the civilian  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:45 Mar 09, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G08MR6.057 S08MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s t r e b o r s         ",2011
345,116,2011-03-08,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  am pleased to  introduce, along with  Senator GRASSLEY,  the Saving Kids  From Dangerous Drugs Act of 2011.  For years, law enforcement has seen  drug dealers flavoring and marketing  their  illegal drugs to entice minors,  using techniques like combining drugs  with chocolate and fruit flavors, and  even packaging them to look like actual candy and soda. This bill would  address  this  serious  and  dangerous  problem by providing  stronger penalties when drug dealers alter controlled substances by combining them  with beverages or candy products, marketing or packaging them to resemble  legitimate products, or  flavoring or  coloring them with the intent to sell  them to minors.  Recent media  reports demonstrate  the need for this legislation. The Santa  Cruz Sentinel had an article earlier  this month about someone who is planning to market sodas laced with THC,  the psychoactive component in marijuana. Some of his planned sodas include orange-flavored ‘‘Orange Krush’’  and grape-flavored ‘‘Grape Ape’’ which  actually was the name of a children’s  cartoon character!  Regrettably, this is a problem that  has persisted for many years, with drug  dealers trying various methods of luring kids to try many dangerous drugs.  For example, in March of 2008, Drug  Enforcement  Administration,  DEA,  agents  seized cocaine near Modesto,  California, that had been flavored like  cinnamon, coconut, lemon and strawberry.  Similarly, there have been many incidents  involving methamphetamine.  In a 2007 article entitled Flavored Meth  Use on the Rise, USA Today stated  that ‘‘reports of candy-flavored methamphetamine are emerging around the  nation, stirring concern among police  and abuse prevention experts that drug  dealers  are marketing  the  drug  to  younger people.’’  The size and sophistication of some  of  these  operations  is  particularly  alarming. In March of 2006, DEA discovered large-scale marijuana cultivation  and  production  facilities  in  Emeryville and Oakland, California.  Thousands of marijuana plants, and  thousands of marijuana-related soda,  candy, and other products were seized  from the drug dealers’ facilities. The  products were designed and packaged  to look like legitimate products, including an item called ‘‘Munchy Way’’  candy bars.  Current law already provides an enhanced penalty if someone distributes  drugs to a minor. Under this provision,  the maximum sentence for the underlying distribution offense is doubled,  and tripled if it is a repeat offense.  Similarly, this bill would provide an  enhanced penalty in those situations  where drug dealers are altering controlled substances in ways that could  make them more appealing to minors.  Someone who is altering a controlled  substance in ways prohibited by the  legislation would be subject to a penalty of up to ten years, in addition to  the penalty for the underlying offense.  If someone commits a second offense  prohibited by the act, they would be  face an additional penalty of up to 20  years.  This bill sends a strong and clear  message to drug dealers—if you flavor  or candy up your drugs to try to entice  our children, there will be a very heavy  price to pay. It will help stop drug  dealers from engaging in these activities, and punish them appropriately if  they don’t.  The Senate passed a similar version  of this legislation in the last Congress,  but it was not considered in the House.

347,124,2011-03-08,Mr. LATHAM.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize  the achievements of  the eighth-  grade students at Carlisle Middle School  in  Carlisle,  Iowa. These students  recently  finished first in the nation in the FBI’s Safe Online Surfing (SOS) Internet Challenge in December 2010.  The SOS  Internet Challenge  is a national  competition that seeks to educate elementary  and middle school students about the importance of safety when using the internet. The  topics include protecting personal information,  online predators, cyberbullying,  instant messaging,  social  networking,  copyright,  and  more. Scores  in  this competition are determined by a series of web-based quizzes the  students  take after completing  the program.  Over 1,000 eighth-grade students  from 47  schools  in 17 states participated  in  the December SOS Internet Challenge.  The Carlisle Middle School eighth-grade students completed the SOS Internet Challenge  under the direction of their technology instructor Julie Thompson. While  the class as a  whole placed first in the challenge, those students who received the top scores were Bailey  Garner, Kaleigh Haus, Max Becker,  Lynn  Huang, and Josh Hagedorn. These five students were awarded FBI bags  that  included  school supplies and certificates.  I commend  the eighth-grade students at  Carlisle Middle School  for  their exemplary  work  in  the SOS  Internet Challenge.  In  this  world of advanced technology that allows for  increased networking, it is imperative that our  children know how  to keep  themselves and  their personal information safe.  I know  that my colleagues  in  the United  States Congress will join me in congratulating  these students on their accomplishments. It is  an honor to serve as their representative, and  I wish them the best of luck in the future.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF JOE BURNS  HON. JACKIE SPEIER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 8, 2011  ",2011
348,124,2011-03-08,Ms. SPEIER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor  Joe Burns, a U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman  from San Bruno who will celebrate his 20th  birthday on March 5, 2011. This is an extraordinary birthday for Joe, not only because he is  entering the second decade of his life, but because it’s a miracle that he is alive.  Joe’s job was to provide medical care for  Marines with Delta Company, 1st Battalion,  1st Marine Division  in Afghanistan. On February 17, 2011 he and three Marines were in  an armored  vehicle  in Helmand Province,  when they struck an Improvised Explosive Device. The  IED  literally blew up underneath  Joe’s feet. The vehicle went up in the air and  was propelled forward. Joe broke five bones in  his heel and suffered a concussion. One Marine also suffered a heel injury, the other two  were not hurt.  It  is absolutely miraculous  that everyone  survived the ambush. The vehicle was Mine  Resistant Ambush Protected, or MRAP. Joe’s  mother Lori Burns is convinced that it was that  technology that saved her son’s life. She recalls how she first learned about the incident.  The hospital corpsman  treating Joe handed  him a phone and he said:  ‘‘Mom,  I’m ok,  I  broke my heel, they blew me up.

This young man did  not want to leave Afghanistan; he wanted to  continue serving his country despite his injury.  I want to thank Joe for his service. He represents the courage and bravery of our troops.  Joe grew up in San Bruno, California and  went to St. Roberts Elementary School. After  he graduated from Burlingame High School in  June 2009, he was enlisted in the Navy in October of the same year.  On January 1, 2011, Joe was deployed on  his first tour to Afghanistan—not exactly what  he expected. When you enlist in the Navy, his  mother quotes Joe as saying, you think you  are going to be on water, not sand. It was on  day 47 of his deployment that the IED blew up  underneath him and sent him back home.

HINCHEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 8, 2011  ",2011
349,124,2011-03-08,Mr. HINCHEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay  tribute  to  International Women’s Day,  which  recognizes and  celebrates  the economic, political, and social achievements of  women  throughout  our  global  community.  Since 1911, millions of women and men have  gathered together on this date to campaign for  the right of women to vote, work, hold public  office and be  treated without discrimination.  This year marks the Global Centenary of International Women’s Day and I am proud to help  commemorate this anniversary by recognizing  the  incomparable achievements  that women  here in the United States and throughout the  world have thus far achieved.  Over  the years, women have made great  strides  in  their quest  for equality and we  should applaud these advances. However, we  must also recognize that our work is not over.  While women now hold positions in the highest ranks of government, work as doctors, scientists and attorneys, their wages still lag behind those of men performing the same work.  The passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay  Act moved us one step closer to equality in  the workplace, but there is still progress to be  made. And  though  it  is encouraging  that  crimes against women are now  treated with  the seriousness  they deserve,  the  rate of  crimes committed against women continues to  exceed that of those committed against men.  Although we must view  the advances  that  have been achieved as heartening and important strides forward, we must continue to labor  until full equality and equal access to opportunity for women is achieved.  In New York’s 22nd Congressional District,  which I proudly represent, the Dutchess County Regional Chamber of Commerce and Women’s Leadership Alliance, along with their partners in all of the other area Chambers, have  been engaged  in promoting, supporting and  encouraging  the  leadership,  professional  growth  and  economic  success  of women  throughout  the Hudson Valley  region. Their  successes are clearly a shining example of  the creative accomplishments that have been  realized by women worldwide. I wish to compliment the Chamber on the excellent leadership in supporting women to succeed.  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to  recognize the women of the Hudson Valley, all  of  the members of  the Dutchess Regional  Chamber of Commerce, as well as women  throughout  the world as  they celebrate  the  100th anniversary of  International Women’s  Day. I am proud to stand with them as they  continue to work tirelessly toward full equality  for women everywhere.  f  HONORING CASIMIR PULASKI, POLISH-AMERICAN  HERO  OF  THE  REVOLUTIONARY WAR AND HONORARY AMERICAN CITIZEN, AND  CELEBRATING PULASKI DAY  HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 8, 2011  ",2011
350,124,2011-03-08,Mr. LIPINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor the life of Polish and American freedom  fighter Casimir Pulaski. Yesterday in my home  state of Illinois, we celebrated Casimir Pulaski  Day, which is observed on the first Monday of  March. Prior to the Pulaski Day celebration at  the Polish Museum of America in Chicago, I  joined with Representative MIKEQUIGLEYand  Senator MARKKIRK to announce the introduction of a new bill to push for Poland’s inclusion  in the Visa Waiver Program. Certainly there is  no better day than the one honoring Casimir  Pulaski to promote the strengthening of America’s ties with Poland.  Born in Warsaw, Poland, on March 6, 1745,  Casimir Pulaski was a skilled commander who  fought  against Russian  forces  in Poland.  Based upon his work fighting for freedom in  Poland, Pulaski was  recruited by Benjamin  Franklin to join in the American Revolution. In  his  first correspondence  to George Washington, Pulaski famously wrote, ‘‘I came here,  where freedom is being defended, to serve it,  and to live or die for it.’’ In his first battle of  the Revolution,  the Battle of Brandywine on  September 11, 1777, Pulaski helped alter the  course of history by rallying a counterattack  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:29 Mar 09, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A08MR8.010 E08MRPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 B 6 X X D 1 K S D n o s t r e b o r s         ",2011
351,6,2011-03-29,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," I yield  3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from  New York (Mrs. MCCARTHY), a member  of the committee.  Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. Mr.  Chairman, let me say something first.  In the beginning of this program, we  didn’t have any service. That means  there were no people out there to help  those that were trying to apply. But we  have  seen encouraging  signs  in  the  economy; yet we are still on a long  path  towards  economical  recovery.  Many of my constituents are still facing hardship, including trying to keep  their homes.  When the housing crisis hit, the private sector responded by turning their  backs on those that needed the help. As  a result, Congress stepped in and created housing programs to hold the industry accountable and to help these  families weather the worst housing crisis that we have seen in generations.  Now, thanks to the leadership of the  President  and  the Democratic-controlled 111th Congress, we are seeing  more and more servicers adopting their  own programs, largely based on the eligibility criteria within the programs  such as HAMP.  The past few weeks my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle have brought  bills to the floor to terminate these  programs,  claiming  they have done  more harm than good to the homeowner and that struggling homeowners  are in better hands with the private  companies  that  contributed  to  the  housing crisis in the first place. Most  of the homeowners got in trouble because the private sector is the one that  got them in the problems.  I disagree with that and point to constituents who have reached out to my  office for help because their servicers  were not being responsive.  The bill before us totally terminates  the HAMP program; however, it protects assistance to the homeowners in  a trial or a permanent modification.  My amendment, which was not made  in order, would have expanded that  provision to include homeowners who,  on or before March 1 of this year, submitted required paperwork for HAMP  or had made a verified request to their  servicers seeking that modification.  My district office has heard from dozens and dozens of my constituents who  have been waiting for up to 16 months,  16 months for a response from their  servicer regarding the eligibility  for  HAMP. They reach out to my office at  the point of total frustration due to  the lengthy response time when they  have  submitted  the  required paperwork. I shudder to think what the response rate would have been without  this program in place.  It’s very disheartening that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  would  like to shut down these distressed homeowners before they have  even a chance to qualify for the assistance.  The HAMP program was by no means  perfect. Everybody agrees on that. Nor  was it meant to be permanent. We all  agree on that. Instead, it was meant to  hold the mortgage service industry accountable and responsive to those that  needed the assistance.  At a time when our housing market  is still very  fragile and  foreclosures  continue to occur in record numbers,  instead of terminating these programs,  we should be trying to improve them.  During  the markup  in committee,  when we were trying to improve, we  asked our colleagues, all right,  let’s  not terminate it; let’s try and fix some  of the things that are not right.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.  ",2011
352,6,2011-03-29,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," I yield  the gentlewoman an additional minute.  Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York. Supporting  efforts  to  terminate  these  housing  assistance  programs means  turning your back on your own constituents.  Mr. Chairman, we have our disagreements. There’s no two ways about it.  But with that being said, to judge a  program from the beginning when we  couldn’t get servicers, now we are getting servicers, now we are getting people to be responsive on getting people  to stay in their homes.  And think about it: All these homes  that are being lost to families, where  are they supposed to go? In New York,  you can’t find an apartment, so what  are we doing, making more people  homeless?  It was not the fault of the homeowners. I agree, there were many people  that  shouldn’t  have  probably  bought a house for $700,000 or $800,000.  The majority of us here in Congress  couldn’t even afford  something  like  that. They  should have never been  given a mortgage. All of us, when we  bought our homes, had to go through  the third degree. How much money do  you earn? Can you pay the insurance?  Can you pay your taxes?  That’s why we also put legislation in  there to have the servicers help them.  ",2011
353,6,2011-03-29,Mrs. BIGGERT.," Mr. Chairman, if I  might inquire how much time is remaining on both sides.  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from  Illinois has  191⁄2minutes  remaining.  The gentleman from Massachusetts has  23 minutes remaining.  ",2011
354,6,2011-03-29,Mrs. BIGGERT., I reserve the balance  of my time.  ,2011
355,6,2011-03-29,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts., I yield  2 minutes to the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. CARNEY).  ,2011
356,6,2011-03-29,Mr. CARNEY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  today to oppose this ill-advised effort  to repeal the Home Affordable Modification Program. Instead, we ought to  be focusing on how we can move together, Democrats and Republicans, to  address the foreclosure crisis and keep  families in their homes.  Since the housing bubble burst, over  9 million Americans have gone  into  foreclosure. In my little State of Delaware, annual foreclosure filings nearly  tripled over the past few years. And we  aren’t even one of the worst, hardest  hit States.  Now, one thing is clear. We can’t help  every one of these homeowners. Every  situation is different; and, frankly, not  every homeowner can or  should be  helped. And most of the help should  come  from the banks and mortgage  servicers, but they are not doing nearly  enough in the State of Delaware.  What is incredible to me is that, with  the  HAMP  Termination  Act,  our  friends on the other side of the aisle  have decided not to help at all; and  that will mean a more direct path to  foreclosure for thousands of families.  The claim is that HAMP has hurt  more people than it has helped. That is  simply a ridiculous charge. Back in my  home State of Delaware, the HAMP  program has helped 1,600 homeowners,  by far the most effective government  program. That’s  25  percent  of  the  homeowners who filed for foreclosure  last year.  And I know a little bit about this. I  served as the chair of the foreclosure  task force when I was lieutenant governor for over a year.  And the best course, the best result  we know is for the private banks, as I  said, and the servicers to make the  modifications necessary,  for the private sector to shoulder the bulk of the  burden. But they’re just not doing it.  And so public officials need tools to  help out, and HAMP is one of the best  tools we have.  The real question here  is whether  you believe there is an appropriate role  for government at all to help homeowners facing foreclosure through no  fault of their own. It’s okay to use taxpayers funds to bail out the banks, but  my friends on the other side don’t want  to use a small amount to help homeowners.  ",2011

359,14,2011-03-29,Mr. ELLISON.," I rise in opposition to  the  gentleman  from  New  York’s  amendment and in opposition to the  underlying bill today.  Mr. Chairman, the middle class  is  shrinking, and deficits are rising because Republicans are giving a pass to  special interests who cheated American  homeowners and wrecked our economy.  This is the 13th week of the Republican-controlled Congress. Republicans  continue to ignore the people’s top priority, which is jobs. Instead of working  to keep middle class families in their  homes, the Republican plan is to foreclose on the American middle class.  The American people sent us here to  protect the dream, not to destroy it,  not to perpetuate a Wall Street nightmare. Democrats are standing with the  American people to create good-paying  American jobs and to keep Americans  in their homes.  This legislation is just the latest attempt by the Republican majority to  end foreclosure programs to help middle class Americans. The majority’s  housing plan is very simple: foreclose  on the middle class. Now that millions  of  families have already  lost  their  homes, their plan is to hand out foreclosure notices to everybody else.  What’s the Republican answer if you  lose your home to foreclosure? So be it.  What’s the Republican answer if your  neighbors lose their homes? So be it.  What’s the Republican answer if you  lose your job? So be it.  Mr. Chair, I would like to yield 20  seconds to the gentleman  from New  York for a question. I am offering the  gentleman 20 seconds because I want to  ask him a question.  Does the gentleman want to answer  the question?  ",2011

371,14,2011-03-29,Mr. ELLISON.," We are here for the  specific purpose of  trying  to create  some jobs and to help the American  people create their own dreams. That’s  about jobs. We’ve been here 13 weeks,  and the majority caucus, Mr. Chair,  hasn’t created one single job.  I asked the gentleman from North  Carolina how many jobs this bill is creating, and he just went off on a tangent  somewhere. Now, I’m looking for some  kind of a number. I’ll even take an estimate.  How many jobs does this bill create?  I yield to the gentleman.  ",2011
372,14,2011-03-29,Mr. MCHENRY.," When you cut Federal spending, you create private sector  finish  just  from  jobs. When you tax people more, you  get less private sector growth.  ",2011
373,14,2011-03-29,Mr. ELLISON.," I reclaim my time.  Look, we are supposed to be creating  jobs around here, Mr. Chair, and we’re  not creating anything.  b1540  The fact is we get spin and we get  imaginary arguments and we get failed  and flawed economic theory but no answer  to  the  fundamental  question,  which is, when are the jobs going to  start arriving around here?  Mr. Chair, it is a pretty simple question: How many jobs does this bill create? How many families will this bill  help keep in their homes? In fact, Mr.  Chair, I have three major studies here  with me today which I would like to  enter into the RECORDwhich state very  clearly that the Republican spending  bill eliminates nearly 1 million jobs.  The Economic Policy Institute study  shows that the Republican spending  bill, H.R. 1, will cut nearly 1 million  American jobs. Mark Zandi of Moody’s  Analytics  said  that  the Republican  spending bill will cut 1 million jobs. A  report from Goldman Sachs says that  the Republican spending bill will cut  nearly 1 million jobs.  Why  is  the Republican majority  against jobs? Why won’t they take a  moment to do something about jobs?  [From the Economic Policy Institute, Feb. 9,  2011]  REPUBLICANPROPOSALTO‘RIGHTOURFISCAL  SHIP’ THROWSMOREWORKERSOVERBOARD  (By Rebecca Thiess)  Update: Since this piece was posted last  week, the magnitude of discretionary funding cuts for the duration of this fiscal year  proposed by House Republican leadership has  grown substantially, especially considering  the short time frame for implementation.  After the House Appropriations Committee  detailed $74 billion in cuts last Wednesday, a  number of conservative members demanded  $26 billion in additional cuts to make good  on the  ‘‘Pledge to America,’’ bringing the  total  level of cuts  relative  to President  Obama’s FY 2011 budget request to $100 billion. A full $100 billion cut to discretionary  spending would likely result in job losses on  the order of 994,000, using OMB’s GDP projections (CBO’s projections are based on current  law) and assuming a fiscal multiplier of 1.5.  The new GOP budget proposes cutting non-  security discretionary spending by $81 billion  relative to the president’s $478 billion request  for  2011. Non-security discretionary  cuts of this magnitude would likely result in  job losses of just over 800,000. (2/15/2011)  Today  the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee released a list of 70 proposed funding cuts to government operations  for the rest of fiscal year 2011. The cuts included in the committee’s proposal are extensive in both their depth and reach. In  total, House Republicans propose funding the  government at a  level  $74 billion below  President Obama’s FY 2011 budget request.  Of that cut, $58 billion (over three-quarters)  would apply to non-security discretionary  spending.  Included on the chopping block are a $224  million cut to Amtrak, a $256 million cut in  assistance to state and local law enforcement, an $889 million cut for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, a $1  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:48 Mar 30, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K29MR7.025 H29MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

383,30,2011-03-29,Mr. LARSEN  of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker,  this  amendment  does  one  simple thing:  It  continues  the Home Affordable  Modification Program for members of  the Armed Forces and Gold Star recipients.  Mr. Speaker, we all know the Home  Affordable Modification Program has  not performed to the original projections, but this is an effort that has provided 600,000 permanent loan modifications. Six hundred thousand American  families are still in their homes because of this effort. I doubt these families would tell you it is not working.  Mr. Speaker, some will say that terminating  this program won’t affect  those who have already received modifications or are working  through a  modification currently. Yet many more  families still need help, especially military and gold star families.  Even though the economy is beginning to recover, the housing market is  still  struggling. HAMP  is  currently  helping 30,000 additional families every  month.  I would prefer that we keep this effort going for everyone. But if we are  not about to, at a minimum we need to  preserve this program for active military and gold star families.  Regardless of how anyone feels about  the underlying legislation and regardless of how anybody feels about the  funding for the original legislation, we  can all agree that we owe our men and  women in uniform a tremendous debt  of gratitude for their service and sacrifice. While defending our country,  servicemembers should not be afraid  that their families will lose the roof  over their heads, but that’s the very  situation in which a Navy sailor found  himself last year as part of Operation  Enduring Freedom.  Seven  thousand miles  from home,  there was little he could do to help his  spouse balance the stress of raising two  children, of her work, and of household  expenses. To top it off, their mortgage  was about to jump to almost $2,300 a  month. But this family was able to find  relief in the Home Affordable Modification Program.

One of those things is sitting on the Judiciary Committee with  the gentleman  from Texas  is, and I  haven’t  learned  it very well, but at  least I saw the demonstration on how  to listen. One of the common denominators of the judges from Texas that  we have serving  in this Congress  is  they are all good listeners. They also  have heard a lot of stories, some the  truth and some not, and they sort that  out pretty well.  When I hear Judge CARTERcome to  the floor to tell us how it is, I’m pretty  confident that he has listened really  carefully and drawn a judgment as to  what’s the truth and what isn’t and  boiled it down to the essential facts of  Constitution  and  law  and  common  sense and rendered a verdict. So as I  hear this verdict emerging here from  the presentation this evening, it calls  me to the floor to say thank you to the  gentleman from Texas for bringing this  up, for all the times that you’ve come  to the floor and sometimes fought a  lonely battle that turned out to stand  on a good cause.  That’s the way good things get started. It’s usually one person starting this  out and then truth seems to attract  more people to a truthful and good and  a just cause.

385,38,2011-03-29,Mr. CARTER.," I will reclaim my time.  I am just about through. I just wanted  to point out, I don’t have anything  against fluorescent light bulbs. I’ve got  a  few  fluorescent  light bulbs  in my  workshop out in the garage, mainly because they just gave me more light for  less money, not because of the electricity. But I made that choice. I think  that’s fine. If people want to choose to  have all fluorescent light bulbs in their  house, I think that’s great. That’s the  America we  love. But I don’t think  NANCYPELOSIor anybody else in this  House of Representatives ought to be  telling us what kind of light bulbs we  have to have. It doesn’t make sense.  It’s not fair to you. You are a person of  independent will. You are granted liberty and freedom by your Constitution,  the Constitution of the United States,  and those are just recording God-given  rights and privileges. I don’t see why  we think we are the center of the universe for knowledge in this House to  come up and tell you what kind of light  bulbs you can have. Or what kind of energy that you can consume. Unless it  comes out to be against the national  interest. And I would argue right now  with all  the alternative energy, we  haven’t got anything to replace what  we’re using right now yet. But keep  working on it and then we’ll let us  make the choice, let the American citizens make the choice as to what they  want to do. I think that’s good freedom. That’s good liberty. That’s what  we are all about in this country, and  that’s why we prosper, because we give  the individual the right to make his  own choices. If he chooses to do something that harms others, we can put a  stop to that. That’s why we have laws.  But if he doesn’t, if he just wants to  live his life the way he wants to live it,  we don’t have any business telling the  individual how to live his life. And I  would argue this stupid light bulb rule  is one of those things. I will argue that  until  it  is  imposed completely as a  mandate sometime next fall, I think.  And then I guess the light bulb police  will be coming after me.  But, seriously, this  is the kind of  things that we do by regulation, or impose our will on others, and in many  instances it is done by bureaucrats who  sit in Washington, D.C., and they probably have never even seen that plow  that we just saw in that farm, except  maybe they’ve seen it on television.  But they’ve certainly not seen anybody  out there sweating on an Iowa farm or  a Texas farm operating what looks like  is a disc harrow that’s turning the soil  there. And yet they’re writing regulations to regulate this man’s life. Maybe  they’re the right thing to do, but you  wonder when they have one and they  come up with another one that you  have to still meet the first one, stack  the second one on top of  it, and  it  clearly serves no purpose.  These are all the kind of arguments  that frustrate you. They’re the kind of  things that make the average businessman, the average farmer, rancher, decide to hold off on investing in America  because he wants to know what America he’s investing in, he or she is investing in. That is the real issue that is  driving the fact that we are still sitting here right around 9 percent unemployment after all these months, over  25 months, we’re sitting here with the  same 8.9, which is as close to 9 as I  want to get percent unemployment because the Americans that create the  jobs are concerned about what’s next.  I yield to the gentleman from Iowa.  ",2011
386,38,2011-03-29,Mr. KING of Iowa.," I thank the gentleman from Texas.  As I listen to this presentation, a  number of things occur to me about  what happens when you have the Federal agencies and the Federal agencies  are passing rules and regulations that  even though there is a broad authority  that’s granted to those agencies by this  Congress, some of the things that they  do are beyond the imagination of the  people that debated or voted for the  bill in the first place.  I look at the Clean Water Act and the  Endangered Species Act, which  are  more than 30 years old by now. They’ve  turned into something way beyond the  imagination of the people that passed  them. The environmentalists that supported them then seemed to be on the  edge of what would be considered mainstream. Looking back on that, they  would be considered mainstream now.  But the problem that we have, and particularly with EPA, would be that the  mothers and fathers of the EPA employees  that  first  implemented  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the Clean  Water Act and the Endangered Species  Act, now their children have picked  this up and others from outside, a second generation of people.  b2040  They have come into these professions now with—like many young people do—and it’s a very good thing to be  idealistic and have a sense of a cause—  but if you look at a law that was written in 1978, and you apply it with a vision of having a cause that you want to  be championed for in 2011, quite often  the  second  generation  environmentalist  is  something entirely different than the first generation environmentalist. And they will interpret  the  law and write rules beyond the  scope of the imagination of those who  drafted it and ratified it and the President that signed it.  And so I deal with things back in an  environmental  perspective,  having  spent my life’s work in the soil conservation business. We have gone out  and done some drainage work. Mostly,  it’s been surface work, permanent practices—terraces, dams, and waterways—  and I’ve envisioned that we would want  to send all the raindrops down through  the soil profile to purify that water in  nature’s  intended way and keep the  soil  from washing down stream and  ending up in the Gulf of Mexico.  And yet the regulations that come  from some of the EPA initiatives are  things such as—I can think of protected streams, an issue that came to  many States, but it came to Iowa. It  was one of the things that drew me  into political life. They wrote a rule  that said that these waters for these  streams, these 115 streams that were  designed to be protected for their natural riparian beauty, to quote the rule,  some of them were drainage ditches  that I had floated and walked those  streams all through western Iowa. And  some of those streams were just drainage ditches. There was no natural riparian  left-over beauty because they  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:48 Mar 30, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K29MR7.080 H29MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 9 Z 8 H V D K S D n o l l e b j         ",2011

388,54,2011-03-29,Mr. SESSIONS.," Madam President,  government  funding  is set to expire  next week on April 8. We are in the  midst of the 2011 fiscal year that ends  September 30, and the Congress has  only appropriated money through April  8. If Congress does not act by that  time,  the  government  would  shut  down.  Congress needs to act, but Congress  needs to listen to the American people  and  listen  to  the  financial  experts  whom we have dealt with and reduce  spending and reduce the surging deficit  we face this year, last predicted to be  $1.4  trillion. Nothing has ever been  seen like it before, and it has to be addressed. There is no way around it.  So we have this deadline hanging  over our heads, and the reason is, my  colleagues in the Democratic leadership in the Senate will not agree to the  kind of substantial but realistic spending reductions the House of Representatives has sent to us. The House has  sent us a budget plan that I think will  work. But what we hear is, the sky will  fall if we trim the $61 billion from a  $3.7 trillion budget—$3,700 billion that  we spend—if we reduce that spending  by $61 billion, somehow this will cause  the country to sink into oblivion.  The American people know better  than that. That  is not realistic. Of  course, we can cut those kinds of numbers out of this huge budget we have,  and the American people will be better  off for it.  As ranking member on the Budget  Committee, I have looked at the numbers, and that $61 billion reduces the  baseline of Federal spending by $61 billion this year, but over 10 years—because  it  is a baseline  reduction—it  would save $860 billion. This is the kind  of small but significant step that does  make a difference.  People say: It does not make any difference. Why don’t we  just  increase  spending? Why do we cut spending at  all? Of course, we have to reduce spending. The American people know the  borrowed money and overspending of  the past 2 years have failed to produce  what it promised. Instead, all that has  been achieved  through  this massive  surge in Federal spending, through the  stimulus package and other programs,  is a crushing debt burden that weakens  our economy and is a drag on our economy, as expert witnesses have told us.  It threatens our economic future. Alan  Simpson, former Republican Senator,  and Erskine Bowles, formerly the Chief  of Staff to President Clinton, were appointed by President Obama to cochair  the debt commission. The fiscal commission  reported  to us, and  jointly  they submitted a written statement  that said if the United States fails to  act, it faces ‘‘the most predictable economic crisis in its history.’’ This is a  real warning. They said such a crisis  could arrive in as soon as 1 or 2 years.  People have been saying: Oh, we are  on the wrong track. If we do not get off  it, in 3 or 4 or 5 years, we are going to  have a crisis. More and more people are  warning us that crisis is sooner. Mr.  Bowles said: In 1 year, give or take a  little bit, we will have a crisis. Mr.  Simpson said: I think within 1 year.  The American people rightly expect  their elected leaders to confront this  threat with  seriousness and candor.  But  the President  has  never  once  looked the American people in the eyes  and told them the truth about the financial crisis we face. Has he ever discussed those kinds of words with the  American people, that we face an actual crisis? We could have a debt problem that hits us very quickly, just like  the one in 2008 that put us in a deep recession. We are in a fragile recovery  now, and we need to keep that recovery  going. The last thing we need to do is  have another recession, or some sort of  other financial collapse that puts more  people out of work and weakens an already struggling economy.  It  is not  necessary this occur.  The President and his Budget Director have, instead of being truthful with  us,  falsely boasted to the American  people that under their budget we will  ‘‘live within our means’’ and ‘‘not add  more to the debt’’ and that ‘‘we’re not  going to spend any more money than  we’re taking in.’’ He submitted his 10-  year budget to the Congress, and that  is what he says his budget will do. But  not one of those statements is true—  not one.  When the budget was announced, Mr.  Bowles, whom the President appointed  to head the debt commission, said it is  nowhere close to what we need to be  doing to get our house in order. In fact,  the Congressional Budget Office finds  this: that our annual deficits never  once fall below $748 billion. I was saying $600 billion before based on the  President’s estimates of his budget.  Now the Congressional Budget Office  has done an  independent analysis of  the President’s budget, and they say  the lowest single annual deficit, in 10  years, would be $748 billion.

I remember being on the floor of the  1984 Democratic Convention when she  gave her acceptance  speech  for  the  Vice President of the United States,  and it was electric listening to her. It  epitomized for me, and I am sure every  woman  there,  the  fact  that women  could do anything.  Geraldine Ferraro worked tirelessly  on behalf of human rights and women’s  rights around the globe. She dedicated  her public service to the ideals of respect and equality and she lived a career that called on all women to challenge the glass ceilings of the world. I  think it is particularly important because just because one woman breaks  the glass ceiling doesn’t mean opportunities are open to every woman, and  she understood that and continued to  encourage all the ceilings across the  world to be broken for women.  Gerry’s life was a powerful example  for all of us who are honoring her  today and for our daughters and granddaughters. We thank her for leading  the way. She will be missed.  Thank you. I yield the floor.  ",2011
391,62,2011-03-29,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Madam President,  I rise today to reflect on the life and  legacy of Geraldine Ferraro who lost  her heroic battle with cancer on Saturday.  Geraldine Ferraro was first elected to  public  office  in  1978  to  represent  Queens in the U.S. House of Representatives.  As a member of the Public Works and  Transportation Committee, she pushed  to  improve mass  transit around La  Guardia Airport.  Later, she would cosponsor the Economic Equity Act, which was intended  to accomplish many of the aims of the  never-ratified equal rights amendment.  In 1984, former Vice President and a  distinguished Member of  this body,  Walter Mondale, chose Gerry to join  him as his Vice Presidential running  mate, the first woman to be placed on  a national ticket.  I was privileged  to  serve as  the  mayor of San Francisco in 1984 where  the Democratic Party held its convention that election year.  Twenty-seven years later, as I look  back on that time, I realize what an  important and historical moment her  selection was to American politics.  I recall the emotion and enthusiasm  of  people—men  and women—at  the  Moscone Center in San Francisco when  Gerry took the podium.  Sixty-four years after women won  the right to vote, Geraldine Ferraro  represented a new beginning  for our  politics. It was an amazing feeling.  While  the  election  didn’t  go  the  Democrats’ way that year, Gerry’s selection was a victory for a generation  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:03 Mar 30, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G29MR6.021 S29MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 C 2 8 P 5 D K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

396,78,2011-03-29,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  today to join with my colleague from  Washington in introducing legislation,  the Home Health Care Access Protection Act of 2011, to prevent future unfair administrative cuts  in Medicare  home health payment rates.  Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health care  system. The kinds of highly skilled and  often technically complex services that  our Nation’s home health agencies provide have helped to keep families together and  enabled millions of our  most frail and vulnerable older and disabled persons to avoid hospitals and  nursing homes and  stay  just where  they want to be—in the comfort and security of their own homes. Moreover,  by helping these individuals to avoid  more costly  institutional care, they  are saving Medicare billions of dollars  each year.  That is why I find it so ironic—and  troubling—that  the Medicare  home  health benefit continually comes under  attack.  The health care reform bill signed  into law by the President last year includes $40 billion in cuts to home care  over 10 years. Moreover, these cuts are  a  ‘‘double-whammy’’  because  they  come on top of $25 billion in additional  cuts to home health imposed by the  Centers  for Medicare  and Medicaid  Services through regulation in the last  several years.  These  cuts  are  particularly  disproportionate for a program that costs  Medicare less than $20 billion a year.  This simply is not right, and it certainly is not in the best interest of our  nation’s seniors who rely on home care  to keep them out of hospitals, nursing  homes, and other institutions.  The payment rate cuts implemented  and proposed by CMS are based on the  assertion that home health agencies  have  intentionally  ‘‘gamed  the  system’’ by claiming that their patients  have conditions of higher clinical severity than they actually have in order  to receive higher Medicare payments.  This unfounded allegation of ‘‘case mix  creep’’ is based on what CMS contends  to be an increase in the average clinical assessment ‘‘score’’ of home health  patients over the last few years.  In fact, there are very real clinical  and policy explanations for why the average clinical severity of home care patients’ health conditions may have increased over the years. For example,  the incentives built into the hospital  diagnosis-related group—or DRG—reimbursement system have led to the  faster discharge of sicker patients. Advances in technology and changes in  medical  practice have  also  enabled  home health agencies to treat more  complicated medical conditions  that  previously could only be treated in hospitals, nursing homes, or inpatient rehabilitation facilities.  Moreover, this unfair payment rate  cut is being assessed across the board,  even  for home health agencies that  showed a decrease in their clinical assessment scores.

402,94,2011-03-29,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, I rise again today  to call attention to a significant conflict of interest within the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee  (TPSAC)—a  conflict  that  can and should cast doubt on its recent report  to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the effect of menthol cigarettes on the  public health.  Last year, I submitted a statement for the  Record referencing a Boston Globe article entitled ‘‘FDA Lax on Conflicts of Interest,’’ and  I’m saddened  to see  that  this problem continues to this day at the FDA. Since the FDA  announced  the  nine  voting members  of  TPSAC, questions have surfaced regarding financial and ethical conflicts of interest among  several of  the members. Rather  than  investigate the alleged conflicts and eliminate the  shadow of doubt looming over the committee,  the FDA has stood idly by as these conflicts  have  festered and  threatened  to undermine  the very purpose TPSAC was formed to serve.  Several members appointed to TPSAC have  substantial  financial  interests at stake  in  the  decisions  rendered by  the Committee. One  member is an active consultant to drug companies  that manufacture smoking cessation  products. Another member stands  to make  money on a patented new smoking cessation  drug. Both of these members have also testified against  tobacco companies  in several  legal proceedings. The conflicts could not be  clearer.  Now, we find that TPSAC has, as many of  the original skeptics predicted, released a recommendation  that, short of an outright ban,  nevertheless notes  that  ‘‘removal of menthol  cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit  the  public  health.’’  Rather  than  accept  TPSAC’s report as an unbiased call to action,  we are faced with the same controversy that  should have been corrected more than a year  ago.  The people deserve a government free from  the appearance of impropriety. They have entrusted the members of this Chamber, as well  as officials appointed within the Administration,  to enforce the law even-handedly and to engage  in policy decisions unencumbered by  conflicts of interest, personal biases, or unethical predispositions.  The only solution is for FDA to reject the  recommendation of TPSAC and appoint new,  unbiased members to the committee in order  to carry out the purpose of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The  FDA owes the people a fair and untarnished  recommendation on this important issue and I  call on the FDA to take appropriate measures  to remedy TPSAC’s inane report and conclusions.  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO GENERAL  JAMES R.

403,94,2011-03-29,Mr. BARLETTA.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  honor and acknowledge Major General James  R. Joseph and congratulate him on his recent  promotion  to Assistant Adjutant General—  Army, Pennsylvania, National Guard,  Joint  Force Headquarters, Pennsylvania.  Mr. Joseph, or ‘‘Jimmy Joe,’’ as I know him,  enlisted as a soldier in 1971 to begin his military career. He graduated from basic training  at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and obtained his advanced individual training as a military policeman at Fort Gordon, Georgia. General Joseph  completed a tour of duty in Vietnam, where he  was assigned to the 716th Military Police Battalion. He finished his active duty tour at Fort  Polk, Louisiana, with the 258th Military Police  Company.  But General Joseph did not stop serving our  country. He joined the Pennsylvania Army National Guard in 1974 and was assigned to be  a combat engineer with Company C, 876th  Engineer Battalion. Currently, General Joseph  serves as the primary advisor to the Adjutant  General for all joint logistics matters, including  commodity and material management, property and personnel movement, storage and  distribution, and defense movement coordination, including the acquisition and sustainment  of unique equipment used by National Guard  units in homeland defense, civil support, and  counterdrug operations. He has oversight of  the Eastern Army Aviation Training Site, 166th  Regional Training  Institute, and  the Medical  Battalion Training Site.  Mr. Speaker, General Joseph has dedicated  his life to serving our country. His family has  made sacrifices as he committed himself  to  protecting our freedom and keeping our citizens safe. His courage and commitment  is  something  to be greatly respected and honored. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to congratulate  my  friend,  ‘‘Jimmy Joe,’’ and  I ask my colleagues to stand with me in honoring Major  General James R. Joseph for his greatly deserved promotion to Assistant Adjutant General of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard.  f  INTRODUCTION OF H.R. 804  HON. BOB FILNER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  ",2011
404,94,2011-03-29,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Speaker,  in September  2010, Operation Iraqi Freedom was renamed  Operation New Dawn.  To this effect, I introduced, H.R. 804, legislation that would ensure that military service in  Operation New Dawn continues to be considered service in a theater of operations, for purposes of eligibility  for veterans’ hospital and  nursing  home  care  and medical  services  through the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Our nation’s brave men and women have  fought  together hand  in hand  in  the war  against terror, and many of them are experiencing multiple and extended deployments in  support of Iraq and Afghanistan.  When they return home, we must make certain that veterans would not be denied access  to certain programs because of the way the  law is currently written.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  f  OVERREACHING ACTIONS OF  FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT  HON. TIMOTHY V. JOHNSON  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  ",2011
405,94,2011-03-29,Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, while  being later to the effort than my good friend  Congressman RONPAUL, many of you know  that I have long expressed concerns about the  sometimes overreaching actions of federal law  enforcement, especially as they interact with  American citizens.  Most law enforcement officials in this country are highly ethical with a strong desire to  serve the effort to keep our country and our  communities safe. Unfortunately, as  in any  profession, there are some people who do not  uphold those standards.  Those concerns are a principal reason why  the Bill of Rights was passed. Those concerns  should also hold a primary place in our thinking as we vote on legislation.  This issue came closer to home for me as  two constituents, one a U.S. citizen, were arrested by federal law enforcement officials this  month, accused of violating a law that doesn’t  exist. My office attempted to get information  about their arrest. We were denied information  about which agency had arrested them, where  they were being held, and the charges against  them.  All  of  the  charges  against  them were  dropped  just eight days  later after a  federal  judge reviewed the evidence and determined  that no crime had been committed. The cost  to my constituents was  in  the  tens of  thousands of dollars. They are still being threatened with the forfeiture of property.

406,102,2011-03-29,Mr. BURGESS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize  the Flower Mound High School  Choir.  In 1999  the high school opened with  the hope of becoming ‘‘A World Class School  Educating Tomorrow’s Leaders.’’ Since  then,  Newsweek Magazine named  it one of  the  ‘‘Top 1000 Best Public High Schools’’ in the  U.S., based on AP scores. Of  the school’s  many accomplishments, none resonate quite  like the Flower Mound High School Choir.  The Flower Mound High School Choir regularly  enjoys  success  at  University  Interscholastic League competitions as well as private competitions. Over time they have earned  a slew of ‘‘Sweepstakes’’ awards as well as  ‘‘Best  of Class’’  and  ‘‘Grand Champion’’  awards  from all over  the country. Students  have  also  had  the  honor  of  performing  throughout Europe, both at  the Vatican and  the Salzburg Cathedral. And  just  last week  they were here in Washington D.C. to perform  at the WWII Memorial. In their song choice,  they sought to honor our nation’s veterans.  It is heartening to know that this burgeoning  generation continues to hold our veterans in  such high regard. I want to thank the Flower  Mound High School Choir for coming to our  nation’s capitol to honor our veterans.  f  HONORING ALEXANDER CHRISTIAN  NASON  HON. SAM GRAVES  OFMISSOURI  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  ",2011
407,102,2011-03-29,Mr. GRAVES of Missouri.," Mr. Speaker,  I  proudly pause to recognize Alexander Christian Nason. Alexander is a very special young  man who has exemplified the finest qualities  of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop  376, and earning the most prestigious award  of Eagle Scout.  Alexander has been very active with his  troop, participating  in many scout activities.  Over the many years Alexander has been involved with scouting, he has not only earned  numerous merit badges, but also the respect  of his family, peers, and community. Most notably, Alexander  has  earned  the  rank  of  Firebuilder in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say and the  position of Senior Patrol Leader in his troop.  Alexander has also contributed to his community  through his Eagle Scout project. Alexander planned and supervised  the construction of a storage closet  for Liberty United  Methodist Church in Liberty, Missouri.  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in  commending Alexander Christian Nason  for  his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of  America and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.  f  AFGHANISTAN WAR POWERS  RESOLUTION  SPEECHOF  HON. SAM FARR  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 17, 2011  ",2011
408,102,2011-03-29,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in  strong support of swift U.S. troop withdrawal  from Afghanistan. This decade-long war  is  costing our country tens of hundreds of lives  and hundreds of billions of dollars.  In 2010  alone, nearly 500 brave American men and  women  lost  their  lives, which  is 63% more  than the 2009 death toll. And as I speak, our  government, which has vowed to reduce the  deficit, has sent millions more overseas for a  war with no  foreseeable end. From 2008  to  2011, overall government spending has  increased by 9%, while funding for the war in  Afghanistan has increased by a startling 25%.  As many of my colleagues demand $100 billion budget cuts,  they need  look no  further  than our reckless war spending. For the good  of our troops and the health of our economy,  this war must end.  And this viewpoint is shared across the nation. According to a recent Washington Post  poll, nearly two-thirds of the American people  support an immediate withdrawal from Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, our job in this chamber is  to represent our constituents, and they have  spoken loud and clear. The American people  are fed up with a war that has done little to  improve our national security or bolster our  international standing. Furthermore, after nearly ten years of fighting, it is crystal clear that  the problem in Afghanistan cannot be solved  by military means alone. Stabilization and reconstruction, governance, and peace-building  activities can help to stabilize states, promote  rule of law, and bring enduring peace at a sliver of the cost we pay for troops on the ground.  Make no mistake about it: I firmly support  our men and women in uniform. For this reason, we must bring them home from a battlefront with no real hope of military victory.  I  thank my colleague, Mr. KUCINICH from Ohio,  for re-introducing this Resolution. I was proud  to cosponsor it in the last Congress, and I will  firmly offer my support today in hopes that we  can finally end this war.  RECOGNIZING PENSACOLA STATE  COLLEGE WOMEN’S BASKETBALL  TEAM AS STATE CHAMPIONS  HON. JEFF MILLER  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 29, 2011  ",2011
409,102,2011-03-29,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to recognize the Pensacola State College Women’s Basketball Team on  their recent victory as Champions of the 40th Florida  Community  College  Activities  Association  Women’s Basketball Tournament.  In 2010, the Pensacola State College Lady  Pirates suffered a difficult defeat in the final  seconds of the state semifinal game; however,  under the leadership of Coach Chanda Rigby,  PSC’s players were able to use this defeat as  motivation for their 2011 season. The Lady Pirates entered into the season with high expectations and ranked 14th nationally in the preseason National Junior College Athletic Association Women’s Basketball Poll.  After an  impressive early season  run,  including a victory over the 5th ranked team in  the Nation,  the Lady Pirates soared  to  the  ranks of 3rd in the Nation on November 17.  The following week the Lady Pirates continued  to rise in the rankings, moving all the way to  the number 1 slot. The Lady Pirates did not let  the pressure of being the top ranked team affect their performance, and they finished the  regular season with a perfect record, 29–0,  never relinquishing their place atop the polls.  Victories in their first two games of the Florida state championship set up a fourth meeting with nationally ranked Northwest Florida  State College. The previous  three meetings  between these teams were highly competitive,  with two of those three outcomes decided in  overtime. The championship game was an  equally competitive affair. Ultimately, however,  the Lady Pirates’ season-long goal was  fulfilled, as they cut down the nets, improving to  32–0 and moving on  to  the National Junior  College Athletic Association’s national  tournament, where they finished their season with  a victory  in  the consolation game and  the  number 3 national ranking.  On behalf of the United States Congress, I  congratulate  the Pensacola State College  Lady Pirates for their outstanding accomplishments. My wife Vicki joins me in offering our  best wishes  to  the players, coaches,  faculty  and staff at Pensacola State College for their  continued success.  f  SOUTHWEST GUILFORD GIRLS WIN  IT ALL  HON.

411,13,2011-05-16,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Mr. President, I  rise to honor the service of our Nation’s law enforcement officers on the  occasion  of National Police Week,  which is taking place this year from  May 15 through May 21.  Every day, in cities and towns across  America, police officers put their lives  on the line to protect their fellow citizens. As a State and Federal prosecutor, I was proud to work alongside  so many fine law enforcement officers  in Rhode Island. I saw their hard work,  their dedication to protecting the public, their commitment to upholding the  rule of  law, and the sacrifices they  made for their communities.  During National Police Week, we remember those officers who have fallen  in the line of duty, and we honor their  families. It is a tragedy for a single officer to be killed in the line of duty.  Yet according to the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial  Fund,  there were 162 law enforcement fatalities in America last year, a jump of  nearly 40 percent from the year before.  In 2011, the statistics are even more upsetting: as of May 12, there have already been 69 officer fatalities, a 17-  percent increase from this time a year  ago.  Here in the Nation’s Capital, we are  marking the service and loss of our  country’s fallen police officers through  the events of National Police Week.  Yesterday more  than  20,000 officers  gathered in Washington, DC, to observe  National Peace Officers Memorial Day.  I was proud to  join with Chairman  LEAHY, Ranking Member GRASSLEY,  and other members of the Senate in cosponsoring  a  resolution  recognizing  that  day,  and  commemorating  the  dedication of those officers killed or injured in the line of duty.  I also wanted to highlight for my colleagues two recent events to honor this  occasion in my home State.  Earlier this month, Newport hosted  the 28th annual Aquidneck Island National Police Parade. Hundreds of officers from nearly every police agency in  Rhode Island marched alongside more  than 1,000 fellow police officers from  across the Northeast and Canada.

412,4,2011-06-03,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Again, just so we’re all clear here,  under the War Powers Act, if a concurrent resolution  is passed demanding  that the troops are removed from a  particular country, then they will be  removed, if you believe that the War  Powers Act carries any weight, and I  believe that the War Powers Act is relevant here. That’s what the resolution  by  the  gentleman  from Ohio  (Mr.  KUCINICH) does.  What the resolution my  friends  in  the Republican leadership have drafted  does  is  nothing.  Your  resolution  doesn’t even have to go to the Senate.  It won’t go to the Senate. It directs the  President to do a whole bunch of things  that, quite frankly, he can ignore, because this bill doesn’t mean anything.  What this is—and let’s be clear about  what this is—is this is a way for some  of my friends on the other side of the  aisle to kind of cover their back sides,  to be able to say to their constituents,  We did something tough on Libya. Let  me read to you how tough the language  is in the bill that the Speaker of the  House has drawn up. A lot of tough language.  It sounds good. Except when  you look a little bit more closely, you  realize that this is an H. Res, which  doesn’t mean a thing.  So if you’re into symbolism, if you’re  into therapy, you know, vote for the  Boehner resolution. If you are interested in action, if you are interested in  actually living up to our responsibilities as lawmakers in the United States  Congress, then I would suggest that  you  look at the resolution that the  gentleman from Ohio has drafted.  You can talk all you want about how  the Republican  alternative  here  is  somehow meaningful,  but  it  really  isn’t. Again, I shouldn’t be surprised.  No one should be surprised here, because most of what they have done  since they assumed control of the Congress has been meaningless, has been  symbolic. Whether  it’s dealing with  health care or jobs, which they don’t  want to talk about, you name it, a lot  of it has been mostly symbolic. I think  on the issue of war, we should take it  more  seriously and be more honest  with the American people as to what  we’re doing.  At this point I would like to yield 2  minutes to the gentleman New York  (Mr. NADLER).  ",2011
413,4,2011-06-03,Mr. NADLER.," I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, what we are confronted  with today is not primarily a question  of foreign policy or even of war policy.  We are presented with a question of  constitutional law and of the prerogatives of the United States Congress.  Shall the President, like the King of  England, be a dictator in foreign policy? Shall the President have the unfettered right to take this country to  war without so much as a  ‘‘by your  leave’’ from Congress as the King of  England could do without authorization from Parliament?  The authors of our Constitution answered that question in the negative.  They said, ‘‘No, we don’t trust kings,  we don’t trust executives to make a decision to go to war. We want that to be  the prerogative of the people as represented by the Congress.’’  b0930  A whole series of Presidents since  World War  II have  forgotten  that,  starting with Harry Truman in the Korean War and Lyndon Johnson in the  Vietnam War right up to the present.  Now, there are reasons for this, and I  will go into that when I speak on the  Kucinich resolution a  little  later.  I  would simply observe now I am going  to vote for the Boehner resolution, but  I  am  also  going  to  vote  for  the  Kucinich resolution.  The Boehner resolution is fine as far  as it goes, but it doesn’t deal with the  basic problem. The Boehner resolution  says the President has failed to provide  Congress with a compelling rationale  based upon U.S. security interests for  current United States military activities, that is true. Frankly, I do not understand why we are in Libya.  The Boehner resolution then says the  President shall transmit to the House  of Representatives all kinds of information, basically saying why we are  there, and that’s good. You should have  done that before we went there, but it’s  good that we demand this information  now. But then the Boehner resolution  stops.  All it demands of the President is  that he gives us his reasons. And his  reasons, maybe we will agree with him,  maybe we won’t. Maybe they are sufficient, and maybe they are not.  Then it says, ‘‘Findings.  ‘‘(a) The President has not sought,  and Congress has not provided, authorization for the introduction or continued involvement of the United States  Armed Forces in Libya.’’  That’s true.  ",2011
414,4,2011-06-03,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  time of the gentleman has expired.  ,2011
415,4,2011-06-03,Mr. MCGOVERN.,  I yield  the gentleman 1 additional minute.  ,2011
416,4,2011-06-03,Mr. NADLER.," I thank the gentleman.  ‘‘(b) Congress has the constitutional  prerogative  to withhold  funding  for  any  unauthorized  use  of  the U.S.  Armed Forces, including for unauthorized activities regarding Libya.’’  That’s also  true, but  so what.  It  doesn’t direct anything. It doesn’t say  that what the President did was outside his powers. It doesn’t direct that  the activity stop. It doesn’t do anything. I think we should do something,  because if in this situation we do not  reclaim congressional powers,  I can  think of no set of circumstances under  which the President cannot go to war  without going to Congress first, no set  of circumstances. And that turns the  Constitution and the intentions of our  Framers and  the  intentions of our  whole constitutional law system on its  head.  Therefore, I urge a vote of ‘‘yes’’ on  the Boehner resolution and a vote of  ‘‘yes’’  on  the Kucinich  resolution,  which, unlike the Boehner resolution,  actually does something about the situation we find ourselves in.  Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. DENHAM).  ",2011
417,4,2011-06-03,Mr. DENHAM.," You know, this could  not be any more serious. It’s important  for us to debate what our servicemembers are doing in foreign conflicts.  The War Powers Act, it is important  to make sure that the President understands from Congress exactly what we  are willing to do with our American  troops and where we are willing to  fight.  But I do agree he has to give us his  reasons. In Desert Storm, we knew why  we were there. We knew what our role  was, we knew what our goals were, we  knew what our exit strategy was.  These are the very reasons that we  are looking for before we appropriate  funds, before we put our troops at risk,  before any boots go to the ground, before this conflict escalates any further,  before a new government comes into  play, we expect these answers to be  given to us. We expect the President to  do his job, to show leadership, to address Congress and explain why he is  committing American servicemembers.  So this is very serious. It is very serious and it’s long overdue. The President should have come here first. He  certainly should have come here within  60 days. It is long overdue, it is very serious, and the time to demand answers  is now.  ",2011
418,4,2011-06-03,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 15 seconds.  I hear a lot of talk on the other side  about the Boehner resolution requires  the President to do this, it directs him  to do that, he must do this, he shall do  this. But the way you have presented  this in this H. Res. form, the President  doesn’t have to do anything. So let’s  not fool ourselves, and let’s not fool  the American people  that  somehow  this is meaningful.  I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. JACKSONLEE).  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked  and was given permission to revise and  extend her remarks.)  ",2011
419,4,2011-06-03,Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas.," This  could be no more a somber debate than  what we are doing here today, and I  thank the manager, Mr. MCGOVERN,  and the gentleman from South Carolina for recognizing, through the leadership of our House, that the American  people must be engaged  in the constitutional duties that have been set  out for the three branches of government.  Under the Constitution, the war powers are divided between Congress and  the President, and among other relevant grants, Congress has the power  to declare war and raise and support  armed forces while the President is the  Commander in Chief.

420,12,2011-06-03,Mr. BOEHNER.," Let me thank my  colleague for yielding.  In March, when the President committed our troops to NATO’s mission  in Libya, I said that he had a responsibility to the American people to define  the mission, to explain what America’s  role was in achieving that mission and  lay out how it was to be accomplished.  He has not effectively done so. The  American people and the Members of  this House have questions and concerns  that have gone unanswered.  The President of the United States is  our Commander in Chief, and I have always believed combat decisions should  be left to the Commander in Chief and  to the generals on the ground. But the  House also has an obligation to heed  the concerns of our constituents and to  carry out our constitutional responsibilities.  The resolution I have put forward expresses the will of the people in a responsible way that reflects our commitments to our troops and to our allies.  Let me lay out exactly what this resolution does.  First, it establishes that the President has not asked for and that the  Congress has not granted authorization  for the introduction or continued involvement of our troops in Libya.  Second,  it reasserts Congress’ constitutional role to fund our troops.  Third, it requires the President to  provide, within 14 days, information on  that mission that should have been  provided from the start.  And, lastly, it reaffirms the vote that  we took last week that says that there  should be no troops on the ground in  Libya.  I hope the President will recognize  his obligations outlined in this resolution and provide this information to  Congress and, in doing so, better communicate to the American people what  our mission in Libya is and how it will  be achieved.  The resolution offered by my colleague from Ohio (Mr. KUCINICH) conveys the concerns of the American people, but it also mandates a precipitous  withdrawal from our role in supporting  our NATO allies in Libya. In my opinion, that would undermine our troops  and our allies, which could have serious consequences for our broader national security.  In my view, the gentleman’s resolution goes too far. We may have differences regarding how we got here,  but we cannot turn our backs on our  troops and our NATO partners who  have stuck by us over the last 10 years.  In 1991 in my first vote as a Member  of this body, I voted to authorize the  use of force in the first Gulf War. It  was a consequential time, but I think  we did the right thing. And today is no  different. On behalf of the American  people and our country, we have an obligation  to  support  our  troops  in  harm’s way and to support our allies.  This resolution puts the President on  notice. He has a chance to get this  right; and if he doesn’t, Congress will  exercise  its constitutional authority  and we will make it right.  I urge a ‘‘yes’’ on the Boehner resolution and a ‘‘no’’ on the Kucinich resolution.  ",2011
421,12,2011-06-03,Mr. BERMAN., I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  (Mr. BERMAN asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ,2011
422,12,2011-06-03,Mr. BERMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition to this resolution.  If the Members of the House choose  to pass the Speaker’s one-Chamber resolution, it should add one finding: that  we declare ourselves to be one big constitutionally created potted plant.  This resolution casts all kinds of aspersions on the President. It states the  President has  failed to provide Congress with a compelling rationale for  operations  in Libya. It  implies that  there has been a withholding of documents and information from this body.  Could the President provide more information to the Congress? Of course.  But we need to look not just at the  President’s failure to seek an authorization, but the refusal of this body to  exercise its authority in this area. The  onus rests with us to recognize the sacred duty of authorizing the use of  force.  A resolution like this, with no operative language, with no invocation of  the War Powers Resolution and which  was presented to Members for the first  time just 14 hours ago, simply perpetuates a dynamic of congressional acquiescence and acquiescence that, for  the most part, has gone on truly since  the Korean War.  There are two choices here. If the  majority thinks that the President’s  initial efforts to stop a humanitarian  catastrophe were wrong or that current  operations in Libya do not have a compelling national security rationale, it  should support Mr. KUCINICH’s approach  and offer a concurrent resolution pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers  Resolution requiring the removal of  U.S. forces.  If the majority has concerns with Mr.  KUCINICH’s approach, as many of us do,  and believes terminating military action would have grave consequences for  U.S. national security, it should simply  authorize the use of force in Libya, incorporating the restrictions on ground  forces that this resolution has, that the  Conyers language in the DOD bill had.  I would gladly join the Speaker in cosponsoring  such an authorization of  the limited use of force.  But pursuing a nonbinding House  Resolution that takes potshots at the  President  and  amounts  to  nothing  more than a sense of the Congress is  just an exercise in political gamesmanship. It is a pedantic effort to embarrass the President without taking any  ownership for the policy of the intervention.  The majority, not the President, puts  this body in a position of powerlessness  through such toothless efforts. We are  60 days into this operation. Either we  should authorize this action or terminate, not play around with reporting  requirements.  The resolution is also confusing. It  states that the President shall not deploy or maintain the presence of U.S.  military units on the ground in Libya.  b1100  But as the majority well knows, U.S.  military activities are limited to air  operations and nothing more. So does  this  language mean the majority  is  okay with the current intervention in  Libya? The majority seems to be raising a fuss while winking at the White  House. That’s not the way to legislate.  Finally, I object to the resolution because it is downright inaccurate. The  resolution  implies  that  there  is no  compelling national security rationale  for operations in Libya. But U.S. interests are clear. They have been forcefully articulated by the administration  and, ironically, by conservative advocates like Bill Kristol.  We are  in Libya because we are  averting a probable massacre against  civilians. We are in Libya because our  NATO partners need our help. Refusal  to act there would send a message to  NATO allies, who are putting  their  forces on the line in Afghanistan, that  we are not a dependable partner. We  are in Libya because our friends struggling for democracy in the Middle East  are watching events there. If we failed  to  act,  or worse,  seek withdrawal  today, what will we be saying to the  activists in Tunisia and Egypt, whose  fragile movements for democracy could  be stifled by the destabilizing effect of  a Qadhafi-led government remaining in  power? And what message would we be  sending to Assad and to other dictators  and enemies about our staying power?  Let’s not kid ourselves. A Qadhafi  who is unleashed to commit acts of terrorism around the world will do so with  unspeakable barbarity. We know Qadhafi’s  record of bloodshed, and we  know his readiness to use terror, especially now that he has nothing to lose.  I cannot think of a more compelling rationale for current operations in Libya.  I object to the characterization that  U.S. national  security  interests and  humanitarian objectives are incompatible. In Libya, it is quite clear that  stopping murder and preventing a refugee crisis very much correspond with  U.S. national interests.  The Republican sponsors of this resolution are trying to have it both ways.  They want to criticize the President  for taking the very action that many  of them called for 3 months ago.

423,20,2011-06-03,Mr.  JORDAN of Ohio.," Madam Speaker,  more than two months after stating that our  military action in Libya would be over in ‘‘days,  not weeks,’’ President Obama has yet to explain to the American people what our mission  in Libya is, how it will be conducted, and when  it will be completed. He has failed to explain  how our military involvement in Libya fits with  our policy  interests  in  the Middle East and  northern Africa. Most importantly, he has ignored his constitutional responsibility to uphold  federal law by choosing not to acquire authorization  from Congress  for our  involvement  there.  That  is why  I cosponsored Mr. TURNER’s  resolution disapproving of the President’s actions, and that is why I joined my House colleagues today in demanding action from the  President.  The President must follow the law and seek  approval for this military action from Congress.  In doing so, he must explain some basic facts,  such as whether  the  removal of Moammar  Qaddafi  is part of  the mission, how stability  will be promoted in the region if Qaddafi is removed from power, and who among the anti-  Qaddafi forces in Libya should be supported in  the event that he is removed.  Instead of following the clear path of seeking congressional approval as outlined in federal  law,  the President unilaterally escalated  our military efforts in Libya after assuring us  they would be scaled back. Now, some in the  Obama administration are saying we should  put boots on the ground in support of further  NATO actions. This is the opposite of what the  President promised and contrary to the will of  the House.  Congress appropriately shows a certain deference  to  the  commander-in-chief when  it  comes  to national security decisions, as we  must always have  the ability  to quickly  respond to threats to our sovereignty and our interests around  the world. Further, Congress  must  not  direct  troop movements  or  set  timelines for our military operations, as such  decisions should be left to our highly skilled  commanders on  the ground. But our deference  is contingent upon  the President respecting the Founders’ intent for the primary  role of Congress in providing for our defense  and security needs.  It does not change  the  fact that the President is obliged to seek congressional approval and  to explain how our  mission in Libya is vital to our national security.  The brave men and women in our armed  forces, as always, are performing their duties  with  the  greatest  expertise  and  professionalism of any military  in  the world. The  issue at hand is the failure of the President to  seek congressional approval required by law,  and  the  failure of  the President  to  tell Congress and the American people the details of  our mission.  The American people will always stand with  those who seek freedom and self-determination. Today’s vote reaffirms that it is vital the  President obey the rule of law in doing so.  ",2011
424,20,2011-06-03,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Madam Speaker,  like  many members of this body, I have been outraged by the President’s failure to comply with  the War Powers Act and to define the U.S.  mission in Libya. This Congress must not neglect its responsibility and authority regarding  the use of force in Libya, and the debate we  are having today is long overdue.  I  think most Americans,  including myself,  agree that seeing Moammar Gadhafi and his  regime of thugs removed from power would be  a good  thing. However,  I  think most Americans, including myself, also feel strongly that  American forces should not be committed to  this kind of mission without the consent of the  U.S. Congress.  Our Founding Fathers envisioned a country  where the executive branch and the legislative  branch share the responsibility regarding the  use of force. President Obama has not sought  the consent of the Congress in terms of involving American forces in Libya and that is  why we are having this debate today.  I rise in support of H. Res. 292. This resolution demands that the President provide answers about our involvement in the conflict in  Libya, including the President’s justification for  not seeking Congressional authorization  for  this action. The resolution gives the President  14 days to respond to this request. The President should take very seriously this resolution.  And our  leadership  in Congress should be  vigilant to demand a full and clear response  from the President. This resolution also gives  adequate notice to NATO and our other allies  of  the concerns of  the House before  the  House takes further action. The further action  must  take note of  the President’s  failure  to  comply with the War Powers Act and notwithstanding that fact must also take note of our  Nation’s foreign policy interests and efforts to  combat terrorism.  H. Res. 292 is an important first step in restoring the balance that our Founding Fathers  envisioned, that our legislative and executive  branches share  the  responsibility  regarding  the use of U.S.  force. However,  the action  taken today should not be the last step. In 14  days, the House of Representatives should reconvene  to evaluate our continued  involvement in Libya. We must then make hard decisions about the operation in Libya and the role  of the United States in this conflict. I hope my  colleagues will  join me  in remaining vigilant  and demanding accountability from the White  House.  ",2011
425,20,2011-06-03,Ms.  JACKSON  LEE  of  Texas.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H. Con.  Res. 51, ‘‘Directing the President, Pursuant to  Section (c) of the War Powers Resolution, to  remove the United States Armed forces from  Libya,’’ I support the War Powers Resolution  however I cannot support a resolution which  requires the President to withdraw all United  States Armed  forces within 15 days of  its  adoption.  As  the Ranking Member of  the House  Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security and Senior Member of the  House Judiciary Committee, I believe in supporting the Constitution of the United States.  This Concurrent Resolution  is a reminder  to  the American people that we must firmly hold  true to our constitutional duties. We have the  power  to  ensure  the Executive  does  not  overstep its bounds. As Members of Congress  we can exercise our power through appropriation, the appointment process, exercising oversight over  the Executive, enactment  legislation, or even establishing a select Committee  to probe any abuse of power by the administration.  Presidents, Members of Congress, scholars  and  lawyers had  long argued about which  branch of government has the power to decide  whether the nation goes to war, and meaningful discussions between the branches has not  always taken place.  In 1973, the War Powers Resolution (Public  Law 93–148) was passed over  the veto of  President Nixon,  in order  to provide procedures for Congress and the President to participate  in decisions  to  send U.S. Armed  Forces into hostilities.  Such force is constitutional under the Necessary and Proper Clause which specifically  provided that ‘‘Congress shall have the power  to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution, not only its own powers  but also all other powers vested by the Constitution  in  the Government of  the United  States . . .’’.  The policy behind this power, entrusted to  the President as Commander in Chief, to deploy U.S. armed forces to defend itself is ‘‘exercised only pursuant to: (1) a declaration of  war; (2) specific statutory authorization; or (3)  a national emergency created by attack upon  the United States,  its  territories or possessions, or its armed forces.’’ Pursuant to this  authority, the President ‘‘in every possible instance’’ shall consult with Congress before deploying U.S. Armed Forces, and to continue  consultations as long as the armed forces remain in hostile situations.  As we consider the War Powers Resolution,  we must also consider facts surrounding the  state of violence and unrest in Libya and the  consequences of both action and inaction on  behalf of the Libyan people.  I believe in the Constitution and the importance of maintaining the power of Congress in  asserting when international conflicts warrant  U.S. military  involvement.  I  call upon  the  President to issue a report detailing the current status of the United States military forces  in Libya within the next 30 days.  We must not forget the bloodshed that continues to take place in Libya. The people of  Libya have given their lives in their fight for  democracy. This conflict began in Libya four  months ago when Colonel Gaddafi failed to do  what was right for his country and its people.

Today I think we owe the American  people an apology because we all as a  House are here to defend and protect  the Constitution of the United States  and it has been way too long before  this debate has been had on this floor.  There is much more at risk today  than Libya. What is at risk today is  the very Constitution that we have  sworn to protect and to uphold. If the  Constitution is at risk, then this House  is at risk.  When this House is blatantly ignored  by another branch, by the President of  the United States, then the people are  blatantly ignored by the President of  the United States and this House will  fall.  I applaud those that have sponsored  this resolution, and I rise in support of  it today.  ",2011

430,28,2011-06-03,Mr. STARK.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I support H. Con.  Res. 51, a bipartisan resolution directing the President to remove the United  States Armed Forces from Libya within 15 days. I’m proud to support this  resolution  by  Representatives  It  gives  Congress,  and  therefore  the  American people, the power to decide  whether America enters into or continues a war which destroys our economy,  which  destroys  unnecessarily  human lives who do not oppose us and  are not a threat.  For us to be wantonly killing people  around the globe, entering into a war—  there’s no other question about that—  without permission from the American  people through this body is unconstitutional, it’s wrong, and we should support the Kucinich amendment.  ",2011
431,28,2011-06-03,Mr. BERMAN.," Madam Speaker, I am  pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from  Nebraska  (Mr.  FORTENBERRY), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.  ",2011
432,28,2011-06-03,Mr. FORTENBERRY.,"  I  thank  the  gentleman from California, our ranking member on Foreign Affairs, for the  time.  Madam Speaker, this is a very tough  call, a  tough  set of  circumstances.  There is much complexity here with  the convergence of war and diplomacy  and geopolitics and allied relations.  What is clear, however, is that the  President has not communicated effectively with the United States Congress,  nor has he sought this body’s authorization for the undertaking in Libya.  Let’s have a brief history lesson here,  though: Some in this body called for  unilateral action against Libya just 3  months ago. That was appropriately resisted  by  this  administration until  other nations, particularly the British  and the French, were willing to put up  their own assets and give structure to  a NATO coalition.  However, now U.S. actions, in an important allied effort to save Libyan civilians from imminent slaughter, have  clearly moved beyond the scope of humanitarian relief and stabilization efforts.  With that said, an abrupt and imminent cut-off of U.S. participation  in  Libya causes numerous complications  and would be highly disruptive. Yet we  should not creep, we must not creep toward opening up a third front in Libya,  which is the root cause of this debate.  The general framework for intervention without express congressional authorization has precedent and  some  parallels within the last 30 years. Let’s  look at Lebanon in 1982, Panama in  1989, Bosnia in 1995, and Kosova in 1999.  All of these interventions had various  levels of controversy, particularly the  one in Lebanon; but they were undertaken  by Presidents  of  the United  States.  The Boehner resolution, considered  before this one, gives the President a  small window of time to better make  thank  the genhis case. If the President cannot, Congress can assert its authority and disapprove.  Raising principled questions about  war powers is a laudable goal, and I do  want to commend the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. KUCINICH) for his leadership  in this important debate. It would not  have happened without him.  However, I think we should move forward  very  carefully.  Speaker  BOEHNER’s resolution pushes the President for answers but stops short of requesting  congressional  authorization  or abrupt withdrawal of U.S. participation in the Libya mission. If this approach is unfruitful, we can then exercise further options.  ",2011
433,28,2011-06-03,Mr. KUCINICH.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield  11⁄2minutes  to  the gentleman  from Massachusetts  (Mr. CAPUANO),  who has been a driving force behind  this resolution.  ",2011
434,28,2011-06-03,Mr. CAPUANO.,"  I  tleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to be  one of the original cosponsors of this  resolution. But I want to be honest, I  take no pleasure in this. I’m an early  and ardent supporter of the President  on most everything. This has nothing  to do, in my mind, with the President  or, truthfully, even with the action in  Libya. For me, this is about the Constitution, plain and simple.  The Constitution  is clear. It’s not  even about the War Powers Act. I personally think the War Powers Act is  probably unconstitutional. The Constitution is clear. On many things it’s  not. It is unequivocally clear that the  declaration of war is the responsibility  of Congress, period. No gray area there.  Now, I know you can try to fudge on  what the definition of war is, but when  someone is shooting at someone else,  that’s war. If it’s one person, 10 people,  or 10 million, that’s war. For me, that’s  what this is about.  Now, don’t get me wrong. I would  hesitate strongly—I doubt that I would  support the action in Libya. But that’s  not why I cosponsored this.  And I’ve had some people say, well, 15  days is unreasonable. Well, okay. Then  if this passes, they have 15 days to  come back to us and ask us for more  time, which I would be inclined to do if  that’s necessary on a military basis.  b1300  What this simply says is that Congress has to stand up on our own two  feet and take the actions that we took  an oath to take, which is to uphold the  Constitution.

Richard Roehrkasse was appointed to fill a  vacancy on the Board of Trustees for Southwestern  Illinois College (SWIC)  in 1991 and  has been continuously  re-elected since  that  time. A  resident of Red Bud,  Illinois, Mr.  Roehrkasse had experience in the Information  Technology  field as a systems analyst, designer and project manager. He had a desire  to serve his community and pursued membership on the SWIC Board of Trustees as a way  to help ensure access to quality education for  area residents.  As a SWIC Trustee, Mr. Roehrkasse has  enthusiastically worked with  faculty, administration and staff on  the Strategic Planning  Committee since  its  inception. He helped  to  update existing and develop new Board policies and procedures to address strategic planning priorities.  Mr. Roehrkasse has been a consistent, active participant  in helping SWIC maintain  its  longstanding  accreditation with  the Higher  Learning Commission  (HLC),  and  achieve  model-institution recognition from the HLC for  its Academic Quality  Improvement Program  (AQIP) initiatives and achievements.  With his background  in  Information Technology, Mr. Roehrkasse has been a  longstanding champion of  IT—from smart-classrooms to community-wide applications—helping to establish SWIC as one of the leading  IT-supported community colleges in the state  and the nation.  In his longstanding role as Board of Trustees Facilities and Finance Committee Chair,  Mr. Roehrkasse has helped  to develop and  identify  funding  resources  for SWIC and  to  complete numerous major capital development  projects. Among  the significant projects  to  benefit from his involvement are; the Liberal  Arts and Information Sciences buildings at the  Belleville Campus;  renovations and expansions at the Sam Wolf Granite City and Red  Bud Campuses; and the Schmidt Art Center,  in collaboration with  the SWIC Foundation  Board.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in an expression of appreciation to Mr. Richard Roehrkasse for his 20 years of service as  a Trustee of Southwestern Illinois College and  to wish him the very best in the future.

Policy, who received  the prestigious National Education and Leadership Award from the Sons of Italy Foundation on May 25th. This award is presented by  the foundation annually to the Italian American  who has upheld a commitment to educational  excellence, leadership and the betterment of  society. Previous recipients of this outstanding  award  include  Joe  Paterno  and  Antonin  Scalia.  Mr. Policy, a native of Youngstown and  Ohio’s 17th district, graduated  from Youngstown State University  in 1963, and  in 1966  earned  his  Juris Doctorate Degree  from  Georgetown University Law Center here  in  Washington, DC. For many years, he pursued  a successful law practice career in Ohio.  In 1983, Carmen traded in the courtroom for  the gridiron and became Vice President of the  San Francisco 49ers.  In 1991 he became  President and CEO of the franchise. As an executive in the 49ers organization, Mr. Policy  played a key role in delivering 4 Super Bowl  trophies back to the city of San Francisco. In  1994 he was named  the National Football  League Executive of the Year by The Sporting  News and GQ listed him as one of the most  powerful men in professional sports. In 1998,  Carmen became President and CEO of  the  Cleveland Browns and during his  five years  with the Browns, he served as a member of  the NFL’s Finance, Business Ventures, and  Super Bowl Advisory Committees.  After 25 years in the NFL, Carmen, along  with his wife Gail, began a new life of wine  making  in  the Napa Valley and  the couple  founded the Casa Piena Winery. The roots of  Casa Piena go back to Policy’s childhood in  Youngstown’s Smokey Hollow neighborhood,  where the making and sharing of wine played  a central part in the vibrant family life of this  largely Italian-American community.  He has sent a strong and clean message to  the youth of the Mahoning Valley; if you work  hard, play by the rules and get a good education, America will reward you with all  the  blessings of this great land.  Mr. Speaker,  today  I  rise  to congratulate  and honor the hard work and dedication of Mr.  Carmen Policy and his wife Gail. I invite my  colleagues  to  join me  in  recognition of  this  award.

440,52,2011-06-03,Mr. PASTOR of Arizona.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor Raul Hector Castro, Arizona’s  first Hispanic Governor, on the occasion of his  95th birthday on June 12, 2011. Raul Castro’s  legacy is imbedded in my home State’s history  for his high achievements despite the racism  he experienced as a young Mexican immigrant  raised  in Arizona. Besides holding Arizona’s  highest State office, Governor Castro served  as a United States Ambassador three times:  to El Salvador, Bolivia, and Argentina. Last  year, Governor Castro was honored with the  prestigious Cesar E. Chavez Legacy Award at  the Ninth Annual Cesar E. Chavez Foundation  Gala in Phoenix. In addition, Governor Castro  received  the Arizona Legacy Award at  the  52nd Annual Arizona Hispanic Chamber of  Commerce’s Black and White Ball.  Governor Castro and co-author Dr. Jack August, Jr. have written a fascinating biography  entitled ‘‘Adversity Is My Angel: The Life and  Career of Raul H. Castro.’’ The book traces  the astounding  life of  the  former Governor  through his childhood as a Mexican immigrant  in a harsh  land  to his election as Governor  and Presidentially appointed Ambassador.  It  chronicles how he overcame personal and racial prejudice to rise to the highest levels of  accomplishment.  During the last couple of years, the former  Governor has been on a mission to visit and  speak with middle school and high school students and encourage them to stay in school  and get an education. Governor Castro has  visited several schools throughout the State of  Arizona sharing his  legacy and more  importantly stressing  the value and  importance of  an education. Education  is a  top priority of  Governor Castro, and the Institute that carries  his name is housed at Phoenix College. The  Raul H. Castro Institute is focused on improving the quality of life for the Latino community  in Arizona and educating and strengthening  partners that serve the Latino community by  fostering  connections with  research  institutions, promoting best practice dissemination,  and  impacting policy decisions  in education,  health and human services,  leadership, and  civic participation.  The Honorable Raul H. Castro continues to  provide vision and leadership in the State of  Arizona, and I ask my colleagues today to join  me in recognizing his life’s accomplishments  and his 95th birthday.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

441,60,2011-06-03,Mr. KINGSTON.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  submit an article which explains some of the  problems and unintended consequences of  the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111–203).  [From Forbes Magazine, by Mallory Factor]  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform &  Consumer Protection Act  is  supposed  to  shield consumers from problems in the financial services sector that many believe led to  the financial meltdown. But Section 342 of  the act introduces a brash example of social  engineering that masquerades as consumer  protection and financial reform. This section  imposes  gender  and  racial  employment  quotas on the  financial services  industry,  which accounts for one-tenth of our economy. The quota provisions will affect over  50,000 financial services firms and other businesses, and the consequences will be enormous.  Dodd-Frank requires at least 29 federal bureaus to open Offices of Minority & Women  Inclusion,  involving  ten branches of  the  Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve  and its 12 regional banks, the Securities &  Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The new diversity offices will implement rules to ensure ‘‘the fair  inclusion and utilization’’ of minorities and  women in all firms doing business with each  agency. The offices will terminate contracts  with any service provider that fails to meet  these as yet undetermined standards. Just  running these offices is estimated to cost  over $58 million annually, says David Patten  in a recent story on Newsmax.com.  These new offices will also assess the ‘‘diversity policies and practices’’ at all entities  that fall under their regulatory eye, including banks, broker-dealers, registered investment advisors and now hedge funds. Along  with more  than  40,000  financial  services  firms, another 10,000-plus businesses, including accounting and law firms that do business with these government offices, will be  subject to this new diversity oversight of  their hiring.  What does this mean for the financial services sector? Assuming each  firm hires at  least one new worker to satisfy the new law,  this provision could raise costs $4 billion or  more annually, depending how  far  forthcoming regulations will extend. Firms doing  business with the government will face additional expenses because they will now have  to monitor the hiring practices of their subcontractors as well. In addition to these reporting burdens, firms must prove to their  regulators and to government offices with  which they do business that they are meeting or working toward racial and gender hiring guidelines. In many cases this will require additional hiring beyond the needs of  the business.  Forcing America’s private firms to hire on  the basis of racial and gender ‘‘guidelines,’’  rather than solely on need and qualifications, is inefficient and makes our businesses  less competitive than their global counterparts. Moreover, four out of the eight members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights  wrote a letter to Congress stating that this  section of the act would likely ‘‘promote discrimination,’’ and urged its removal from  the bill.  There is a better, more cost-efficient solution: Let private companies come up with  their own approaches. Deloitte’s 19-year-old  Women’s Initiative, for example, has boosted  the percentage of female partners, principals  and directors from 7% in 1994 to 23% in 2010.  And minorities and females currently make  up 60% of kpmg’s workforce.  While the idea of encouraging greater participation of minorities and women in the financial services sector is admirable, the government is overreaching when it mandates  gender and racial quotas for private businesses. An affirmative action provision has  no place in a financial services reform bill  and puts additional government burdens and  costs on an already struggling sector of our  economy, putting our recovery at risk.  The megabills that fly through Congress  provide legislators the opportunity to insert  politically motivated provisions—under the  radar. As Rahm Emanuel famously said after  President Obama had been elected, ‘‘Never  allow a crisis to go to waste.’’ The financial  crisis has given the President and Congress  cover to impose their political agenda on private business activity. Watch out: Your industry could be next.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON  OFIDAHO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2011  ",2011

In  the mid 1970’s, Mr. Brown began  working at  the New York State Division of  Human Rights as a Director of Community  and Voluntary Services. In May of 1987, he  earned  the Position of Human Rights Specialist, a position he holds today. He was honored with the 2006 Governor’s Tribute to African American Leaders of Excellence in Service State Award. Mr. Brown’s dedication to our  community is outstanding to say the least, and  I am most proud of all the contributions to my  Congressional District that Courtney C. Brown  has made.  Mr. Brown’s civic priorities have earned him  a well  regarded  reputation of devout social  dedication. He has served as Warden and  Clerk of  the vestry at St. Phillip’s Episcopal  Church, Vice President of St. Philips Housing  Corporation, Trustee of the Episcopal Diocese  of New York, Chairperson of New York Chapter, Union of black Episcopalians, as well as  belonging  to numerous Boards of Directors.  He  is a member of  the Alpha Chapter of  Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. Mr. Brown has  been  honorably  recognized  for  his many  deeds,  including  in 1988, when he received  the Ellen Lurie Award for thirty-five years of  community and civic work in New York City, a  twenty  thousand dollar award, which he donated to St. Phillip’s church.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Courtney C. Brown has  provided mentorship  to our youth and much  needed guidance for our elderly. He stands for  the  empowerment  of  our  community  and  healthy development of our families.  I ask my colleagues and our Nation to join  me in this special Congressional Recognition  of Mr. Courtney C. Brown.  f  HONORING THE REACTIVE  MATERIALS TEAM  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2011  ",2011
444,60,2011-06-03,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  pay  tribute  to  the Reactive Materials Team  from  the  Indian Head Division of  the Naval  Surface Warfare Center  in Maryland’s Fifth  District. Nine scientists composing the Reactive Materials Team were  recently awarded  the 2010 Dr. Delores M. Etter Top Scientists  and Engineers of the Year Award.  This highly competitive and prestigious national award is given annually to Navy civilian  and military personnel who exemplify exceptional scientific and engineering achievement.  The Department  of Navy  established  this  award  to honor scientists and engineers attaining  superior  technical  accomplishments  and to promote continued scientific and engineering excellence  in research.  It  is named  after  an  outstanding  public  servant,  Dr.  Delores M. Etter, former Assistant Secretary of  the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition.  Today,  I am proud  to recognize and congratulate the team—Richard J. Jouet, Joel R.  Carney, James M. Lightstone, Richard J. Lee,  John H. Wilkinson, Joseph P. Hooper, Sam C.  Thuot, Jonathan G. Rogerson, and Edward A.  Lustig, Jr.—for their exceptional achievement  in developing reactive materials to be used in  the explosive cases of our next generation  weapon systems. These  fine scientists and  engineers have are committed public servants—dedicating themselves to research vital  to our national security. As Americans, we  thank them for their efforts and applaud them  on their accomplishments.

445,68,2011-06-03,Mr. BONNER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor  the work of Thomas Davis Jr., a respected  leader in his field and an outstanding citizen of  Mobile, Alabama.  Mr. Davis recently retired as President and  CEO of the nonprofit Community Foundation  of South Alabama, an organization which has  flourished under his guidance over the past 27  years. Beginning as  the program’s development director in 1984, Tom quickly rose to become its executive director in 1985 and went  on to become the president of the foundation  in 2008.  Under his direction, the foundation’s assets  increased from $3 million to over $50 million.  Even more  impressive  is  the growth of  the  foundation’s  charitable  funds  and  endowments. By the time he left office, this number  had gone from 60 funds and endowments to  over 400.  Mr. Davis’ success  is  the product of hard  work, an exceptional work ethic and an unparalleled ability to lead, which proved handy during his oversight of foundation programs that  provided assistance  to earthquake and  tsunami victims  in Japan as well as  those recently affected by  the Gulf oil spill. He was  also instrumental in obtaining health insurance  for local underprivileged children.  It would be a hard task to designate one of  his many achievements as being his greatest,  for Tom accomplished so much throughout his  tenure. However, the nonprofit’s recognition as  a ‘‘Partnership to Build Community Capital’’ by  the Kresge Foundation  is a distinct honor,  placing  the Community Foundation of South  Alabama in an elite group of which there are  only six such programs nationally.  On behalf of the people of Mobile, I want to  thank Tom Davis  for his service and wish  him—and his family—continued success in the  years to come.  f  A TRIBUTE TO MRS. KATHLEEN  BATEMAN  HON.

446,68,2011-06-03,Mr. GUTHRIE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor a great Kentuckian, Mrs. Kathleen Bateman. After 33 years of teaching, Mrs. Bateman will retire leaving behind a legacy of dedication to her students and her community.  Mrs. Bateman graduated from Murray State  University in 1977 with a Bachelor of Arts in  Education and earned her Master’s in Counseling  from Western Kentucky University  in  1986. She obtained her Rank I in Art through  the National Board for Professional Teaching  Standards in 1990.  Mrs. Bateman’s most recent position was at  East Hardin Middle School,  but  she  has  touched  the  lives  of  countless  students  throughout her career while teaching at several elementary and middle schools  in  the  Commonwealth.  A great teacher has the power to affect students  throughout  their  academic  journey,  opening new horizons and starting them on a  positive path with high expectations for the future.  Mrs. Bateman did just that with the unwavering commitment she gave her students.  It  takes a special person and a tremendous level  of perseverance to be an educator—qualities  that Ms. Bateman  exuded  throughout  her  years of hard work.  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring  Mrs. Kathleen Bateman  for her many great  contributions  to  the Commonwealth of Kentucky and  for contributing  to  the success of  many young people in our community.  f  INTRODUCING THE ‘‘SALMON  SOLUTIONS AND PLANNING ACT’’  HON. JIM McDERMOTT  OFWASHINGTON  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2011  ",2011
447,68,2011-06-03,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker, salmon are  one of America’s most precious but delicate  resources. Since the construction of four Federal dams on the lower Snake River in Washington State, certain salmon species have become extinct. Others continue to see drastic  declines  in number. Today,  thirteen salmon  and steelhead species  in  the Columbia and  Snake River Basin are  listed  for protection  under the Endangered Species Act. If we do  not act now, we stand to lose this valuable resource  forever, which  is why  I am  reintroducing the Salmon Solutions Planning Act.  Salmon and  steelhead populations have  major economic, environmental and cultural  significance to the Pacific Northwest. Generations of fishermen have relied on salmon as  an integral part of their communities along the  west coast. Today, even at their current depressed levels, salmon add hundreds of millions of dollars to the American economy and  remain  an  essential  part  of  communities  around the Northwest. If we restore these populations to their original levels their economic  benefits will reach well  into  the billions and  these communities will be able  to continue  their rich traditions.  Already we recognize the importance of preserving  this precious  resource. The Federal  Government and  ratepayers  in  the Pacific  Northwest have spent more than $10 billion in  salmon recovery efforts on the Columbia and  Snake River Basin. These efforts, while commendable, have done  little  to help salmon  populations recover. This legislation commissions studies to focus our efforts so that all  factors are  taken  into account when considering removal. It is critical that our salmon recovery efforts be informed, cost effective, and  successful.  Without action, scientists estimate that several of the salmon populations could be extinct  in less than 20 years. The time to act is now.  Salmon are the lifeblood of the Pacific Northwest, and we, as a country, cannot afford to  lose this national treasure.  f  CONGRATULATING NORB ASCHOM  FOR  EXCELLENCE  IN  RADIO  BROADCASTING  HON. RON KIND  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2011  ",2011
448,68,2011-06-03,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Norb Aschom  for 50 years of excellence  in  radio broadcasting. Norb has been news director of WPRE–AM and WQPC–FM  radio  stations since 1962. Throughout his  time at  the station, Norb has served a critical role by  providing  this  tight knit  town with  the news  each day,  installing a sense of community  through the airwaves.  Norb  is a  fixture  in  the Prairie du Chien  community, a town in southwestern Wisconsin  on the banks of the Mississippi River. At 71  years of age, Norb has worked in the same  building every day  for 50 years. While his  broadcasting home on St. Feriole  Island  in  Prairie du Chien was recently flooded, he was  forced, along with the rest of the station staff,  out of their office and into a temporary workspace in the local Police Department. After a  two week hiatus, Norb was able to return to  his normal office on April 23. Throughout his  time working out of the police department he  never veered  from his commitment  to bring  the news to the people of Prairie du Chien.  In his 50 years, Norb has interviewed everyone  from  former First Ladies Johnson and  Carter, to fellow radio personality Paul Harvey.

450,4,2011-06-16,Mr. KINGSTON.," Madam Chair,  I  want to, first of all, thank my good  friend from Pennsylvania for talking to  me about this amendment. Earlier this  week, I expressed my concerns at that  time, which I still have with it, and  want to make a number of points.  Number one, we’re not 100 percent  sure what this scores out in terms of  budget authority. So  there  is  that  question over it. Number two, I want to  say that while conservation funding is  down, farmers still have access to $5.8  billion  in conservation  funding. And  that’s  for private  landowners. Actually, it’s $5.868 billion, to be exact.  I also want to make sure that my  friends know that even though there  are CHIMPs in this, changes in mandatory programs, that no conservation  contracts will have to be canceled because of these limitations. The Federal  Government cannot and does not break  farm commodity or conservation contracts  without  significant  consequences. We are aware of that. So we  have made sure that none of the conservation  contracts would  be  abrogated.  And then finally I want to say to my  friend the ranking member, just to underscore some of the sensitivities that  we’ve been through in the last couple  of days, that this actually does cut the  WIC  program,  cuts  the Commodity  Supplemental Food Program, and  it  cuts  the Conservation Reserve Program and a lot of the other programs  which there has been so much passion  about on this floor in the last couple of  days.  So with that, I do oppose the amendment, and I urge everyone to vote ‘‘no’’  on it.  ",2011
451,4,2011-06-16,Mr. FARR., I move to strike the last  word.  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  from  California is recognized for 5 minutes.  ,2011
452,4,2011-06-16,Mr. FARR.," Madam Chair, I rise with  great concern for this amendment. It  wants  to  reduce  about  5.8  percent  across the board. Our problem is that  we have dealt a really bad deal. The  bill that we brought to the floor—and  we cut  some  last night across  the  board—is $5 billion, or 23 percent below  what  the President  requested. The  President put together all of the asks,  and as you know, OMB scrubs those  things. And we’re always very critical  of the President’s requests, sometimes  because they’re so  low. Nonetheless,  this is 23 percent below what the President requested. It’s 14 percent below  what we enacted last year.  We in the committee last year, under  ROSADELAURO, when we were in the  majority, we didn’t have the impact on  farm programs, particularly the environmental programs, that the cuts do  this year. It’s below the 2010-enacted  level, and it’s actually below the 2008-  enacted level.  You know, people use these terms  very  loosely,  ‘‘below  a  level.’’ But  think of it in your own personal income. Think about what the costs of  life were for you in 2008 versus now.  And I would submit that almost  in  every case, your water bill, your cable  bill, your garbage bill, your utility bill,  certainly the price of gasoline now, is a  lot higher than it was in 2008. Nonetheless, you’ve got the same amount of  money. So it’s going to have a draconian impact, this amendment and the  underlying bill, on the Department of  Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration.  So I’m concerned. I think the gentleman is well intended to protect the  programs  that  I  care a great deal  about. But  I  think  the  5.8 percent  across-the-board cut on top of what  we’ve already cut is just too much.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. HOLDEN).  The question was  taken; and  the  Chair announced  that  the noes appeared to have it.  ",2011

454,4,2011-06-16,Mr. CAMPBELL.," Madam Chair,  have an amendment at the desk.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the  amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  I  At the end of the bill (before any short  title), insert the following new section:  The amount otherwise provided by this Act  for  ‘‘Agricultural Programs, Animal  and  Plant Health  Inspection Service, Salaries  and  Expenses’’  is  hereby  reduced  by  $11,000,000.  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  from  California is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2011
455,4,2011-06-16,Mr. CAMPBELL.," Madam Chair, this  amendment really ought to be a no-  brainer. It cuts $11 million from the  USDA Wildlife Services’ livestock protection program. Let me give you four  reasons why  this  should  be  a no-  brainer.  First of all, it saves $11 million. Not  the end of the world, but it’s a start.  We all know we have to save a lot of  money. We all know we have to spend  less money, and this is a start for doing  it. Now why does it do that? Why do we  cut $11 million from this? This program  is taxpayer money used to kill potential  predators  that  supposedly  are  threatening livestock. But this killing  of predators  is very  indiscriminate.  We’re killing all kinds of wildlife out  there, both predators and nonpredators, both threatening and nonthreatening. Third,  less than 1 percent of  livestock in America is killed by predators every year. So we’re spending this  money for a tiny, tiny portion of the  livestock  that  is  out  there.  And  fourth—and this is almost the biggest  reason—why are taxpayers paying this?  Why is this a taxpayer responsibility?  If ranchers want to protect their livestock, why don’t they do it? Why don’t  they pay for it?  Madam Chair,  there are  so many  ways to protect these livestock—with  pens and with fencing, with lighting,  with all kinds of things—without indiscriminately killing wildlife and without using taxpayer money to do  it.  Madam Chair, this is $11 million we can  save, should save, and will save if this  amendment is approved.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011
456,4,2011-06-16,Mrs. LUMMIS.," Madam Chairman, I  rise in opposition to the amendment.  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from  Wyoming is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2011
457,4,2011-06-16,Mrs. LUMMIS.," Madam Chairman, the  gentleman  from California would be  correct,  that  ranchers  and  farmers  should be able to pay to deal with the  predator  situation. The problem  is,  they’re not allowed to.  b0930  The  Federal  Government  doesn’t  allow people to kill predators that are  attacking  their  livestock.  So  consequently, here’s another situation just  like we discussed yesterday, where the  government puts restrictions on ranchers and farmers so they cannot protect  their own livestock. So the taxpayers—  because of their demands that ranchers  and farmers not protect their own livestock, the Federal Government steps  in.  In addition, though, wildlife strikes  on  airplanes  cost U.S.  commercial  aviation $700 million a year. One part  of Wildlife Services  is when USDA  works with 822 domestic airports, as  well as Department of Defense air  bases in the U.S. and in Iraq and in Afghanistan. So part of this is to assist  with efforts  to prevent conflict between wildlife and commercial aviation  flights, some of which can be quite devastating and deadly.  Furthermore, there’s been an $18 million loss of sheep and lands to predators, or $111 million when you add cattle and calf  losses. Absent predator  management, losses would explode, and  that would drive  family  farms and  ranchers out of business.  This is a very balanced program in  terms of  the approach  it  takes  to  shared responsibility between airport  managers and Wildlife Services, ranchers and farmers and Wildlife Services.  It requires a tremendous cost share or  matching program at greater than 40  percent.

458,12,2011-06-16,Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.," I also rise in  opposition to this amendment, and I  associate myself with the remarks of  the gentlelady from South Dakota.  I believe  that with  the economic  challenges that our country has felt,  much of which is related to the cost of  fuel, this is an amendment that I think  undermines our ability to recover and  to create jobs.  In our  rural  community down  in  Mitchell County, Georgia, we have an  ethanol facility there which contributes a tremendous amount to the local  economy. It hires people and it is, I  think, the example of how we grow our  rural economy. In  fact, this amendment would  stop  that kind of  job  growth. It would not allow this facility  to expand and to be prosperous, and I  just think that it’s the wrong way to  go.  When America  and  the American  economy gets sick and gets a cold, the  rural economy has pneumonia and it’s  on life support, and we need to make  sure that—we had some 30, 40, 50, 60 individuals in rural Georgia who decided  that they wanted to invest their own  money in a home grown industry for  renewable energy, so that we would be  in a position to contribute to our own  energy self-sufficiency and we would be  able to do it in a way where our local  individuals would be able to create jobs  and to increase the economy there in  our  local  rural  community.  It has  worked very well except for the fact  that  they don’t have  the  facilities,  don’t have the pumps, and we need to  make sure that they do.  This amendment I think is pennywise  and pound foolish, and I think that we  need to go ahead and move ahead to  help our country become energy self-  sufficient. How do we do that? By making sure that consumers do have access  to the blends so that we will not continually have to fight with the Middle  East for the cost of fuel. Oil prices really are battering our economy. Energy  costs are battering our economy. It’s  also battering our national security.  When you look at how many billions of  gallons of fuel are spent for our national security with our military vehicles, our weapons, we need to have alternative energy sources, and I think  this amendment undermines that.  I oppose  it and I associate myself  with all those who oppose this amendment. I think that we need to move  forward with energy  self-sufficiency,  energy independence for our country.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the  amendment offered by the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. FLAKE).  The question was  taken; and  the  Chair announced  that  the noes appeared to have it.  ",2011

461,12,2011-06-16,Mr. GARDNER.," Madam Chair, this  amendment moves funding over to the  integrated  activities  account.  I  am  very concerned about our work when it  comes to animal disease and food safety issues, especially when it relates to  issues like FMD, chronic waste and disease, mad cow disease, other infectious  animal diseases, prion-based diseases.  I want to make sure that we are not  imperiling the U.S. livestock industry,  especially when it comes to our livestock exports. If we were to delay even  just 3 to 4 days in terms of finding or  responding to an outbreak of FMD, it  could cost our country $135 billion in  agriculture and possibly destroy our  export markets.

462,12,2011-06-16,Mr. FLORES.," Madam Chairman,  have an amendment at the desk.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate  the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  I  At the end of the bill (before the short  title), add the following new section:  SEC. 4ll. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to enforce section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Public Law 110–140; 42  U.S.C. 17142).  from  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2011
463,12,2011-06-16,Mr. FLORES.,"  I  rise  to offer my  amendment, which would address another restrictive and misguided Federal regulation.  Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act prohibits Federal agencies from entering into contracts for the procurement of an alternative fuel unless its ‘‘lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions’’ are less than or  equal to emissions from an equivalent  conventional fuel produced from conventional petroleum sources. Simply  put, my amendment would stop the  government from enforcing the ban on  the U.S. Department of Agriculture  and all other Federal agencies funded  by the Ag appropriations bill.  The initial purpose of section 526 was  to  stifle  the Defense Department’s  plans to buy and develop coal-based, or  coal-to-liquids, jet fuels, based on the  opinion of environmentalists that coal-  based  jet  fuel produces more greenhouse gas emissions than traditional  petroleum. Earlier this week, I offered  my  similar  amendment  to  the  MILCON–VA approps bill, and it passed  this House by a voice vote.  My friend from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY)  also had language added to the defense  authorization bill to exempt the Defense Department  from  this burdensome regulation. We must ensure that  our military  becomes  energy  independent and can efficiently rely on domestic and more stable sources of fuel.  But section 526’s ban on fuel choice applies to all Federal agencies, not just  the Defense Department. This is why I  am  offering  this  amendment  again  today.  While we hope the USDA is not going  to be fueling up any jets any time soon,  the underlying bill does allow for the  purchase of more than 400 new passenger vehicles. The Department of Agriculture’s  choice on  fuel  to power  these vehicles to provide service to our  Nation’s farmers and agricultural producers will be  limited without my  amendment.  The USDA should not be burdened  with wasting  its time studying  fuel  emissions when there’s a simple  fix,  and that’s not to restrict their  fuel  choices  based  on  extreme  environmental views, policies, and regulations  like section 526.  Madam Chairman, section 526 makes  our Nation more dependent on Middle  Eastern oil. And stopping the impact of  section  526 would help us  promote  American energy, improve the American economy, and create American  jobs. I urge my colleagues to support  the  passage  of  this  commonsense  amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

What this provision does is it strikes  the requirement in law that says to the  government, which is a big purchaser  of fuel, look, don’t buy dirty fuel. Buy  something that is clean. I mean, that’s  what we’re trying to do is stimulate  clean air, fuel efficiency, alternative  fuels. This strikes us down. This  is  going back to the old smokestack, fill  the air full of dirty air. This goes back  to all the traditional people that just  don’t like the fact that there’s competition out there and that the Federal  Government has to purchase that competition.

479,36,2011-06-16,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman  for that information on the schedule  for the coming week.  I want the gentleman to know that  on our side we are very pleased to see  the patent reform legislation brought  to the floor. As you know, that’s a part  of our Make it in America agenda. I  know it’s a part of your agenda as well.  I think this  is something on which  there obviously has been some controversy with respect to provisions of  the bill, but it is absolutely essential  that we give certainty to patents and  to accelerate the approval of patents.  The backlog that exists is not acceptable. I am pleased that this legislation  has come to the floor. Very frankly,  this is a needed and welcome piece of  jobs legislation.  One of the concerns we have on this  side of the aisle, as you know, is that  we have not from our perspective had a  jobs focus in the last 6 months. We welcome this part of our Make it in America agenda and part of your agenda as  well. Again, I think we can cooperate  in this effort, hopefully, and have a bipartisan effort on this patent reform  bill.  b1410  I also would raise the issue, Mr. Majority Leader, I want to say that I  know that you and Mr. KYLand others  have been participating in the talks  with Vice President BIDEN. There have  been constructive talks, I understand  from your comments and  the comments of Mr. VANHOLLENand Mr. CLYBURNon our side. We are very hopeful  that these talks will prove fruitful and  that we can move ahead. We believe  it’s critical, as you know, and as you  have articulated, that we address the  default prevention responsibility that  we share. Clearly, America wants to  pay its bills, the American public expects us to pay our bill, and the international community expects us to pay  our bills. You and I have both read  quotes  from Mr. Bernanke, business  leaders  like Jamie Diamond, economists and others who have indicated  that  failure to assure that America  does not default on its bills will have  very dire consequences both here and  around the world.  So I am hopeful, Mr. Leader, that, although you did not announce it, we  have very little time left, as you know,  before the August 2nd date which Secretary Geithner has indicated is the  date on which we will no longer have  the cash flow ability to meet our obligations as they become due and to fund  the programs that we have authorized  and provided for the executive department to carry out.  I would very much be interested in  your thoughts with reference to how  we ensure that we take action in a  timely fashion. I was very pleased to  see Speaker BOEHNER’s comment about  a week and a half ago that he was focused on assuring that we did not default and provide for the payment of  our debts prior  to  the end of  this  month. As you know, we have 4 days  left, or 31⁄2days left, in this month, and  that’s next week, because the following  week we’re off. I would very much be  interested in your observations on how  you see us going forward on this critically important issue.  I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.  ",2011
480,36,2011-06-16,Mr. CANTOR.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  I also  thank  the gentleman for his remarks in couching his  observation or characterization of the  agenda having been brought forth by  our side over the last several months,  because we believe strongly that the  focus should be on jobs. We differ, I believe, with the gentleman and his side  of the aisle that a growth agenda is not  necessarily a government program, and  so our agenda, our jobs agenda, is focused on trying to eliminate the environment which is full of burdensome  regulations,  unfair  taxes,  and  new  mandates on the real job engines of  this country, which are, Mr. Speaker,  the small businesses and entrepreneurs  of this country.  If the gentleman would look to see  what we have been doing over the last  several months, he would see that our  agenda  is  very  focused  on  accomplishing that end.  We passed H. Res. 72. It was a resolution directing our committees to take  inventory and review existing, pending  and proposed regulations and orders  from agencies of the government with  respect to their impact on jobs. Those  reports are due June 30. They will be  focused on the kinds of things that we  could be doing to remove the impediments that government here in Washington has created for small business  growth.  We also brought forth H.R. 872, the  Reducing  Regulatory  Burdens  Act,  dealing with a duplicative application  of regulations on the pesticide industry, and, as the gentleman knows, that  bill had a lot of bipartisan support.  We also brought  forward H.R. 910,  which was the Energy Tax Prevention  Act. Mr. Speaker, I think there is probably very little dissent among small  businesses  in  this country  that  the  EPA has stepped entirely beyond its  bounds and has provided gross impediments to the growth of manufacturing  and small business  in this country.  That bill was squarely aimed at trying  to force the EPA to stop in its conduct  of attempting to accomplish what the  prior majority tried to do under its  cap-and-tax agenda.  Mr. Speaker, I would further say, we  brought H.J. Res. 37 to the floor. This  was a resolution of disapproval regarding the FCC’s regulation of the Internet and broadband industry practices,  otherwise called the bill to stop its attempt  to control  the  Internet. The  ability for the government to begin to  impose its will on the Internet is a job-  killer. That bill was also taken up by  the majority.  We also, as the gentleman knows,  passed H.R. 4, the Small Business Paperwork Mandate Elimination Act. He  and his side joined us in the bill, which  began to repeal the job-killing nature  of the health care bill. It was otherwise  known as the 1099 provision, which all  small businesses said placed too much  paperwork burden on them.  We also have been very focused on  what people are most focused on when  they begin to think about the summertime and taking a vacation, which is  the gas prices and the prices at the  pump, and we have brought  forward  H.R. 1230, H.R. 1229, and H.R. 1231, all of  which were aimed at trying to lower  the cost of  fuel  in this country, to  maximize energy production  in  this  country, so not only could  families  have the ability to do what they need  but  also  that  businesses  could  see  lower energy costs.  And all of this, Mr. Speaker, takes  place in the context where we’ve got a  government that is borrowing 40 cents  of every dollar it spends. We believe  strongly that not only do we need to  focus first on growth but we’ve got to  finally do what Washington has failed  over the decades, which is to get its fiscal act  in order, to ensure that we  don’t allow spending to get out of control again.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman asked  about the Biden talks. I share his commitment, as he related, that this is an  important  issue, that no one thinks  that America shouldn’t pay its bills.  But I would also add, Mr. Speaker, that  the people who elected us expect us to  ensure that the fiscal insanity that has  been taking place in this town stop and  that we put in place reforms so we can  demonstrate that we’ve changed the  system. That’s the spirit in which our  side has engaged in the talks with the  Vice President.  As the gentleman knows, I have been  very public in my praise of the Vice  President in his conduct of these talks.  I am hopeful that we can meet or exceed the expectations right now, which  is  to  say we are aiming  to  reduce  spending by the trillions in order for us  to engage in the kind of vote-taking  that needs to take place to stave off a  default.  But I say to the gentleman, first and  foremost, our side will not support any  attempt to raise the debt ceiling that  is not accompanied by the kind of cuts  necessary and reforms necessary, nor  will we support an attempt to raise the  debt limit that raises people’s taxes.  That, we don’t want to do.  So, again, I am cautiously optimistic  that we are moving forward so as to  come to some agreement that meets  those guidelines.  ",2011
481,36,2011-06-16,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman  for his comments.  I would  respectfully note  that  so  much of what he talked about was resolutions. I think resolutions clearly do  state an opinion. Whether or not they  have any ultimate effect is to be seen.  I think the American public, in looking at the agenda the gentleman has  just gone through, probably says to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:22 Jun 17, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K16JN7.105 H16JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y 0 S 9 2 K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2011

486,52,2011-06-16,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  rise in support of the Ethanol Subsidy  and Tariff Repeal Act, which Senator  COBURNand I are offering as an amendment to pending legislation. The other  cosponsors on this amendment are Senator WEBBand Senator COLLINS. This is  identical to a bill that we have submitted. On that bill there are more cosponsors. They are COBURN, CARDIN,  to  WEBB, CORKER, LIEBERMAN, COLLINS,  SHAHEEN, BURR, RISCH, and TOOMEY.  I want to have the record straight  that this amendment is in response to  a bill which we have crafted. On Tuesday the Senate voted on the proposal  but unfortunately we saw a process  battle, which I spoke to on the floor,  which I think overwhelmed, in some respects, the debate. That is not the case  today. There are ongoing negotiations  to see if it is possible to put together a  solution which can bring all sides together on this amendment that we will  be voting on at 2 o’clock. Thus far we  do not have an agreement. However, at  least one of our cosponsors of this has  said to me—this is Senator WEBB—that  he would  very much  appreciate  a  straight up-or-down vote on Coburn-  Feinstein so we know exactly where  the Senate stands. It is still possible,  even after that cloture vote, if we can  reach a successful conclusion to the negotiation that we could have another  vote and change that.  Today, this is the first vote that the  Senate has taken based on the merits  of repealing the ethanol subsidy and  tariff. In a nutshell, let me give the  reasons. I know of no other product in  the United States that has a triple  crown of benefits: It is a mandate: oil  companies must  buy  this  ethanol;  there is a subsidy: oil companies are  paid for buying this substance; and this  substance known as corn ethanol  is  protected by a protective tariff which  prevents other nations, such as Brazil,  from importing ethanol which actually  has more beneficial environmental effects.  KLOBUCHAR As a matter of fact, corn ethanol is  the  least environmentally proficient  form of ethanol. Everything else is better than corn; cellulosic is better, algae  is better, and sugar is better. The bottom line is we have a triple crown of  subsidy, mandate, and protective tariff  on the least effective, least environmentally sound ethanol there is.  More  importantly, corn ethanol  is  now used to such an extent that it is  having a major impact on food commodity prices and in particular on feed  prices. This is particularly true in the  poultry industry. I will get to that in a  few minutes.  I  do  want  to  thank  Senators  and THUNE for good-faith  efforts to try to reach a compromise.  As part of this compromise, at least  from my point of view, a substantial  amount of the revenue must be used to  reduce the debt and deficit in addition  to eliminating wasteful ethanol subsidies and tariffs. These negotiations  have been ongoing since Tuesday. We  have not yet reached an agreement.  The vote at 2 o’clock will not end these  talks. I am perfectly willing to continue to talk but I do think it is important that we have a clean up-or-down  vote on the Coburn-Feinstein amendment.  The issue at hand is a simple issue.  The subsidy given to these oil companies costs taxpayers billions of dollars  every year and the tariff actually has  the effect of making us more dependent  on foreign oil. Let me explain. In 2005,  the ethanol subsidy cost taxpayers $1.5  billion. This year that number is nearly $6 billion. In just 6 years it has gone  from a cost of $1.5 billion to a cost of  nearly $6 billion. There is a reason for  it, and I will get to that in a moment,  but since 2005, the total cost of this  subsidy has been $22.6 billion.  Here is the increase every year: $1.5  billion in 2005; 2006, $2.6 billion; 2007,  $3.3 billion; 2008, $4.4 billion; 2009, $5.2  billion; 2010, $5.7 billion; and the all-  time high in these last 2 years of $5.7  billion.  However,  it continues to rise. The  proposal that has been made for an extension to 2015, by some, would cost another $31 billion.  Let me be  clear. The  subsidy  is  wasteful and duplicative. It does very  little to promote the use of ethanol  which oil companies already must use  under current law. The renewable fuels  standard dictates oil companies use 14  billion gallons of biofuels this year, 20.5  billion gallons by 2015, to 36 billion gallons by 2022.  These  volumes,  by  law,  increase  every year. It more than doubles by  2022. It is that doubling in volume that  will ultimately cost us; we are currently paying oil companies to follow  this law.  Let me speak briefly about the tariff.  The 54-cent-per-gallon tariff on ethanol  imports makes our Nation more dependent on foreign oil. The tariff acts  as a trade barrier, placing clean sugarcane ethanol imports from friendly nations at a competitive disadvantage to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:53 Feb 24, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S16JN1.REC S16JN1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011
487,68,2011-06-16,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from New Jersey.  ,2011
488,68,2011-06-16,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. President,  I  rise to speak in favor of the Feinstein  amendment. I am a proud cosponsor of  this proposal because it will save us  money, reduce food prices and do so in  a responsible manner.  Ethanol enjoys truly unprecedented  support from the Federal Government.  First there is the renewable fuels mandate that requires ethanol to be blended into gasoline.  Second, there is a 45-cent-per-gallon  subsidy to blend ethanol into gasoline  that is costing the Treasury nearly $6  billion per year.  Third, there  is a 54-cent-per-gallon  tariff on imported ethanol protecting  the domestic industry from any serious  competition.  And to top it all off the Federal Government spends billions every year to  subsidize the growth of corn for ethanol.  In a time of fiscal constraint we simply cannot afford to prop up an industry with such enormous supports.  And these supports are not just costing taxpayers money, but they are also  causing food prices to rise and harming  our environment.  The USDA estimates that 40 percent  of this year’s corn crop will be used for  ethanol. This  is raising grain prices  worldwide,  especially  hurting  the  needy.  For  these  reasons,  the Feinstein  amendment has the support of taxpayer rights groups, religious groups  looking  out  for  the needy,  budget  hawks  concerned about  our deficit,  livestock growers who use grain as  feed, the grocers and restaurants who  are seeing food prices increase, and the  environmental community who understand that corn ethanol requires enormous amounts of fossil fuels to be produced.  My support for the Feinstein amendment is not just because it is the right  thing to do for our country and our  Federal budget, but because it is the  right thing to do for my home State.  New Jersey has over 120,000 flex fuel vehicles, but does not have a single E85  ethanol  pump  in  the  entire State.  120,000 cars that are built to allow  automakers  to  game  fuel  economy  standards but may never see a drop of  E85 fuel.  I know that this issue is important to  our friends in the Midwest, but ethanol  producers already have a guaranteed  market for their product as a result of  the Federal mandate. Now we have an  opportunity to help families across the  country by ending this failed ethanol  policy and providing  relief both  in  terms of their taxes and their  food  prices.  For these reasons, I will be voting in  favor of the Feinstein Amendment and  urge my colleagues to do the same.  I also think this vote is important  for the larger debate over the deficit.  Our friends on the other side of the  aisle have said revenues cannot be a  part of the strategy to reduce the deficit. I think this vote and the one earlier this week in which 34 Republicans  voted to end these wasteful ethanol tax  breaks show there is bipartisan support  for cutting wasteful tax subsidies and  loopholes and that these revenue expenditures must be part of any solution  on the deficit.  As I speak about that, let me end on  another item I think should be on the  table, one I have been promoting. The  first place to start in terms of tax expenditures is oil subsidies.  A bipartisan majority of 52 Senators  voted recently to end these tax breaks.  If these 34 Republicans come into the  fold, we could work together to make  some real progress. Oil companies do  not need these subsidies—I am talking  about the big five—with oil trading at  nearly $100 per barrel. They have all  the incentive they need in the marketplace. But cutting these subsidies, we  can cut the deficit by $21 billion. This  year alone these companies are projected to earn up to $144 billion in profits—not proceeds but profits. If they  can simply live with a mere $142 billion  in profits, then they can do their share  to reduce the deficit without raising  gas prices.  It is time to come together across  party lines and to end wasteful tax subsidies and lower the deficit. This vote  is an important first step, and I think  by doing so we will—notwithstanding  the issues about blue slips and constitutional impediments—send a clear  sense of the Senate that will move us  in a direction that will end the ultimate subsidies and help us reduce the  deficit. I think ending oil subsidies will  get us on a path to a bipartisan solution that is critical for the Nation.  ",2011
489,68,2011-06-16,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President,  I rise  today in support of Senator MCCAIN’s  amendment to prohibit the use of Federal funds for the construction of ethanol blender pumps and ethanol storage facilities. My vote today is not a  vote against ethanol as a transportation  fuel.  I  strongly  support  the  greater use of alternative  transportation fuels and alternative-fuel filling  stations in the United States. In certain cases, I have even advocated for  government support of these goals. But  government support for a source of energy should create a temporary boost,  not a long-term Federal dependency. It  is just as foolish to attempt to build an  economy on subsidized energy as it is  to build a house on the sand.  I have been criticized for opposing a  Democratic proposal to raise taxes on  domestic oil producer, but there is a  difference in the size of the Grand Canyon between allowing oil companies to  keep a portion of their own profits,  which they use for more domestic energy production, versus handing out  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:53 Feb 24, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S16JN1.REC S16JN1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011
490,76,2011-06-16,Mrs. BOXER.," It is a letter from an  arm of the Chamber of Commerce. I  will tell you, it is rare when you get  the AFL–CIO and an arm of the Chamber of Commerce  singing  from  the  same book. They do not want to see  filibusters. They want to see jobs. They  do not want to see filibusters. They  want to see progress. They want to see  us work across party lines.  So I kept asking during my remarks,  why would they do this to us? Why  would they do this to the American  people? I have an answer. I wish this  were not true, but it has been stated by  some of the Republican Presidential  candidates and it has been stated by  the Republican leader here: Their priority is defeating Barack Obama. Their  priority  is  defeating  our President.  Their priority is not job creation, it is  not business creation, it is not fair tax  policy, it is defeating this President.  When you look as it through that lens,  then  you  say  to  yourself, wait  a  minute.  If we  got  something  done  around here and the President had a  signing ceremony—as we used to do in  the good old days when we worked together—and he had a Republican here,  a Democrat here, and an Independent  there, and we all came together as we  always have—unanimous consent. We  passed this in 2004 by unanimous consent. They are afraid if we did that, the  President would take out his pen and  he would sign this bill and we would  create jobs. I hate to say it, but I am  not making it up. That is what they  have said. I hope over this weekend  when we go home and we meet with our  people, and they say, Senators, you  have got to do something about jobs, I  hope the public will say to us, be we  Democrats or Republicans: Do not filibuster jobs bills. We cannot afford to  lose more jobs. We need to create jobs.  The EDA bill is a jobs bill. It was created as a jobs bill. It has been a jobs  bill since 1965, signed by Presidents,  passed by Congress, never loaded down  with amendment after amendment that  is not germane, that weighs it down. I  hope the people at home will pay attention to this.  I will say this: There is a pattern.  This is not the first bill. I told you  about the small business bill, same  thing; FAA bill, sitting over there, no  conferees;  patent  bill,  sitting  over  there, no action. And millions of jobs  are at stake.  I just found this out about the small  business bill that they killed here a few  weeks ago. Each year that bill provides  support for 6,000 businesses, and over  the lifetime of the program it has provided almost 26,000 awards to firms in  California to help them get started.  That bill was filibustered to death. I do  not get it, except if what I say is true  and that is what the motivation is, and  l a e n b j VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:53 Feb 24, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S16JN1.REC S16JN1         ",2011

496,84,2011-06-16,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Mr. President, I  rise today to speak about a serious  issue that touches on our national security, our economic well-being, the  safety of our families, and our privacy;  that is, America’s cybersecurity.  I look forward to conducting an in-  depth examination of the aspects of  this issue that falls within the Senate  Judiciary  Committee’s  jurisdiction  during the Subcommittee on Crime and  Terrorism’s June 21, 2011, hearing, ‘‘Cybersecurity: Evaluating the Administration’s Proposals.’’ However, because  of the importance of improving our cybersecurity, as demonstrated by the recent Gmail spear-fishing attacks and  hacks at Sony, Epsilon, Lockheed Martin, and even the Senate itself, I rise to  make some initial remarks today.  American  technological  innovation  ushered in the Internet age, bringing  with it Facebook, YouTube, and the  rest of the World Wide Web. It set off  an explosion of new commerce, freedom  of  expression,  and  economic  opportunity even in the smallest details of  our lives—allowing a car company, for  instance, to unlock your car doors remotely if you have locked yourself out  of your car.  However, this increased connectivity  allows criminals, terrorists, and hostile  nations to exploit cyberspace, to attack America, to invade our privacy, to  loot our intellectual property, and to  expose America’s core critical  infrastructure to cyber sabotage. Entire online  communities  are  dedicated  to  stealing and selling American credit  card numbers. Consider the disturbing  fact that the price of your credit card  number stolen online actually goes up  if the criminal also  is selling your  mother’s maiden name. Some criminals have learned how to spy on Americans, hacking into our home computers  and  looking out  through  the video  camera attached to the screen. Others  run Web sites selling stolen entertainment without paying  the American  companies that created  it. And millions of American computers—millions  of American  computers—have  been  compromised by malware  slaved  to  botnets  that can  record your every  keystroke and send it instantaneously  across the world to a criminal’s laptop.  I firmly believe that cyber crime has  put our country on the losing end of  the largest illicit transfer of wealth in  world history. Whether  by  copying  source code, by industrial espionage of  military product designs, by identity  theft, by online piracy, or by outright  old-fashioned stealing from banks—just  doing  it  the  electronic way—cyber  crime cripples American  innovation,  kills  jobs here at home, and undermines our economic and national security.  Congress must act to protect Americans from these Internet dangers and  to protect our civil liberties. Let me  say at the outset that the government  must not be allowed to snoop indiscriminately into our online activity, to  read our e-mail, or to watch us online.  There simply is no need for such an invasion of privacy, and we must move  forward with that firmly in mind.  The majority leader has introduced a  leadership bill that will be a vehicle for  our work. The Commerce Committee,  led  by Chairman ROCKEFELLER and  Ranking Member SNOWE, both of whom  I had the privilege to serve with on the  Intelligence Committee, and the Homeland Security Committee, led by Chairman LIEBERMANand Ranking Member  COLLINS, reported key bills last year.  Chairman LEAHY and  the Judiciary  Committee have  reported  important  legislation on data breach and other  issues central  to cybersecurity. The  Armed Services, Energy,  and  other  committees  have  studied  the  issue  from the perspective of their particular  jurisdictions and expertise, and under  the leadership of Chairman FEINSTEIN,  the Intelligence Committee Cybersecurity Task Force completed its classified report last July, authored by me,  Senator MIKULSKI, and Senator SNOWE.  So we have been ready in Congress.  The administration has now weighed  in with its own proposal, recognizing  that we need cybersecurity legislation  to make our Nation safer and launching in earnest our legislative process.  We have hard work ahead to find the  best possible solutions to this complex  and grave challenge to our national  and economic security. As we begin, I  would like to flag five issues that I believe must be addressed as this legislation goes forward.  First, we need to build greater public  awareness  of  cybersecurity  threats  going forward.  What is the problem? The problem is  that information affecting the dot.gov  and the dot.mil domains—the government  domains—is  largely  classified.  And  in  the  dot.com,  dot.net,  and  dot.org domains, threat information is  often kept proprietary by the victim  business  so as not  to worry  shareholders, customers, and regulators, or  give ammunition to competitors. The  result is that Americans are left in the  dark about the level of danger that is  actually out there on the Internet.  The administration’s proposal would  require covered businesses  to notify  customers if their personal information  is stolen, expand reporting of cybersecurity threats, and require some public  assessments of cyber readiness.  I believe more can still be done on  these fronts. I have had the pleasure of  working with Senator KYLto introduce  S.  931,  the Cyber Security Public  Awareness Act. I would like to urge interested colleagues to review  it and  consider  including  it as part of our  larger cybersecurity legislation. That  is first.  Second, the Senate needs to ensure  that we give private industry the tools  necessary for self-defense against cyber  attacks.  Proper sharing among and within industries of cybersecurity threat information  is vital. The administration  took an  important  step  by  recommending, subject to various safeguards,  enhanced  sharing  of  cybersecurity  threat information by the government  with private industry. But we may also  need to remove legal impediments that  unnecessarily  limit  the  sharing  of  threat information within industries,  and we should be prepared to listen  here to the private sector’s needs as  they set up those areas for safe communications about the cyber threats  they share.  Third, our Nation does not have basic  rules of the road for end users, ISPs,  and software and hardware suppliers.  The administration proposal includes  important provisions that would move  us  in the right direction. Assuming  that ISPs—Verizon and Comcast and  the companies that are actually providing  the  service—assuming  that  these companies qualify as critical infrastructure, which is an assumption  we should clarify before getting too far  down this path, the administration’s  proposal would require them to develop  a standardized framework to address  cybersecurity.  Sensible laws and regulations have  made our highways safe, and we need  similarly  to make  our  information  highways  safe. Federal procurement  can encourage effective cybersecurity  standards  with  appropriate  supply  chain security so as to improve cybersecurity across the hardware and software  industries. These  improvements  will benefit the government directly,  but it will also improve the security of  all products on which business and consumers rely.

In doing so, these riders will make  a statement about  the utility,  fuel economy  and fun of using motorcycles and scooters for  transportation.

Two members of  my own staff ride motorcycles for both fun and  transportation.  As more  and more Americans  choose  scooters and motorcycles as  transportation  options, or just choose to ride for recreation,  it becomes ever more imperative that each of  us does all we can  to promote motorcycle  safety. This means  that motorcyclists must  ride  responsibly, by getting  trained and  licensed and obeying traffic safety laws. Other  road users can do their part by being aware  of motorcyclists and sharing the road.  On June 20, I encourage all riders to gear  up and ride to work. I also encourage all other  road users to take special note of all the riders  on the road and remember to always look out  for motorcyclists.  f  HONORING MURIEL REDMOND  HON.

HOWARD COBLE  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 2011  ",2011
503,116,2011-06-16,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker,  unlike  other  sports, baseball is unique because there is no  clock. Unless weather  intervenes,  the game  ends only when the leading team records 27  outs. The baseball team at Randleman High  School, located in the Sixth District of North  Carolina, discovered that getting the last out  can be  the most difficult of all. Randleman  won the North Carolina High School Athletic  Association State 2–A championship on Saturday, June 4, 2011, in dramatic fashion by collecting that final out with a play at the plate.  The Randleman Tigers won this state championship with an 8–7 victory over defending  state champion East Rutherford High School.  The game was played on Doak Field at North  Carolina State University. The Tigers won the  best of three series, two games to one. This  was Randleman’s first appearance in the finals  since 1985 and marks an important achievement in the school’s history.  In the last inning, a six-run lead dissolved to  two. Another hit scored  the seventh run  for  East Rutherford, but as  the  tying  run was  heading to the plate, Randleman’s Tyler Walls  launched a perfect throw to cut-off man Dylan  Richardson.  The  Tiger’s  shortstop  never  paused as he whipped  the relay  to catcher  Zach Bach  to get  the  last out and give  Randleman  its  first  state  title ever. Head  Coach Van Hurley, Jr., told the Asheboro Courier Tribune,  ‘‘To win  like  that, Curtis  [Linthicum] to throw like that. It’s all unbelievable.  We had three outs to get and six runs to give.  I had complete confidence that he was going  to do it.’’  With a grand slam on Friday and pitching  the gutty win on Saturday, Curtis Linthicum received  the MVP award. Joining him on  the  state championship team were Will Albertson,  Easton Welch, Ted Luna, Jacob Tally, Dexter  Allen, Jeremy Taylor, Dylan Richardson, Ryan  Vickers, Cody Trogdon, Tyler Walls, Connor  Pratt and Zach Bach. The winning team was  led by Head Coach Van Hurley, Jr., who was  ably assisted by coaches Shawn Barker, Clayton Welch and Scott Clemons.  The Tigers finished their extraordinary season with a record of 28–4 and the satisfaction  that comes  from experiencing  the  result of  practice and hard work right up until that final  out. On behalf of the citizens of the Sixth District of North Carolina, we congratulate  the  Randleman High School baseball  team  for  winning the 2011 state title.  f  IN SUPPORT OF EXPANDING THE  PRIMARY  CARE  WORKFORCE  AND OPPOSING H.R. 1216  HON. KATHY CASTOR  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 2011  ",2011
504,116,2011-06-16,Ms. CASTOR of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to acknowledge the importance of the  primary care workforce and support provisions  included in the Affordable Care Act to expand  the number of primary care physicians, especially in my home state of Florida.  One of  the smartest  things we can do  in  health care  today  is  to bolster primary care  and family medicine. Your primary care doctor  is your family doctor; the one you and your  family see for checkups, and the doctor who  is most likely to understand your health care  needs. It is widely understood that if we are  going to be more efficient in America with our  health care dollars, we need to focus on prevention and boost the number of primary care  doctors. There is a great demand for primary  care physicians across the country and training new doctors in a community teaching setting is vital.  Training doctors  is an especially  critical  issue in my home state of Florida. We have a  significant doctor shortage. Florida has great  medical schools and are  turning out quality  medical  school graduates, but  that  is not  enough because we do not have a sufficient  number of  residency slots. Florida  is short  nearly 3,000 new GME positions to meet current physician demand. Florida  is  the  third  most populous state, but ranks 44th in the nation in terms of the number of residency positions under Medicare. Those numbers reflect a  brewing crisis situation. Not only does Florida  have the largest and fastest growing percentage of citizens over 65, we have a rapidly  aging  physician  population—25  percent  of  Florida’s physicians are over 65. We need to  do everything possible  to  train new primary  care doctors all across the country, but especially in Florida. H.R. 1216 will take us backwards and that is why I strongly oppose its  passage.  Before we take up legislation to terminate  an  initiative  that encourages  the  training of  new doctors in primary care, family medicine  and internal medicine, please understand our  country’s need for physicians who are most effective for our families. I urge my colleagues  to support a robust primary care workforce.  We need to work together to develop modern  methods to train primary care physicians—and  the Teaching Health Centers GME program,  which my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle seek to eliminate, is an innovative new  model to help train more primary care physicians and encourage them to practice in communities. Physicians who train in a community  setting have a better understanding of  the  needs of  the communities  they serve. Many  organizations—like MedPAC and the Council  on Graduate Medical Education—have called  for a community-based GME program, so why  do Republicans want to eliminate these opportunities before they start? Residency rotation  through rural and outpatient locations provide  great training opportunities for physician residents; and it encourages the resident to practice in out-patient or rural communities.  If we do not work together to find common  sense solutions  for our primary care workforce, America will be short of the doctors we  need  to serve  in our communities and our  families and neighbors will suffer  the consequences. This is why I voted against H.R.  1216 and why I strongly oppose any attempt  to eliminate innovated methods for training our  future primary care workforce.  f  HONORING FIREFIGHTER SCOTT  DAVIS  HON. MIKE PENCE  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 16, 2011  ",2011
505,116,2011-06-16,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I rise  to  honor the service and sacrifice of one of Indiana’s bravest.  Firefighter Scott Davis was tragically killed  yesterday while fighting a fire at Tabernacle of  Praise Church in Muncie, Indiana. He is the  first Muncie firefighter to give his life in the line  of duty since 1955.  Those who knew Firefighter Davis were not  surprised at his boldness and bravery in the  Tabernacle of Praise  fire. He was a  former  Yorktown  fire chief, and had been with  the  Muncie Fire Department since June 15, 2005.  He bravely sacrificed his life protecting the  community, and in so doing, he will forever be  remembered as a hero and servant leader.  In the midst of great tragedy, I honor Firefighter Davis and  the other brave men and  women who risk their lives every day to protect  their community. We must always be  grateful for those who run in when others run  out.  Firefighter Davis was a man of faith, a devoted husband to his wife Raeanne, and loving father of three children—Jake, Emma, and  Max. My family and I offer our deepest condolences and prayers to his loved ones, and we  honor  the  legacy of Firefighter Davis’  life of  sacrificial service.  The Good Book tells us that ‘‘The Lord is  close to the brokenhearted.’’ And that is my  prayer  for  the Davis  family and  the Muncie  community.

507,4,2011-07-28,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, time  is up. It is time for the administration  to quit stalling and make a decision on  the Keystone XL pipeline project, the  pipeline that comes from our friends in  Canada from Alberta all the way down  to my congressional district in southeast Texas, to the refineries in Port Arthur, Texas.  The House has done its job this week  by passing a bill to move this decision  along. Now it’s the Senate’s turn to  pass this bill so that the administration finally makes a decision on the  Keystone XL project that will create  thousands of American  jobs and decrease our dependence on unfriendly  nations for energy.  I commend my friend from Nebraska  (Mr. TERRY) for passing this legislation  and being the spearhead of this legislation.  All that has to happen is the State  Department has to make a decision and  the administration has to support that  decision one way or the other. It’s been  3 years for the administration to make  a decision, yes or no, on the XL pipeline. It’s time to fish or cut bait. Pick  a horse and ride it. The administration  must make a decision.  And this should be, to me, an easy  choice for this administration. Either  they can force Americans to continue  to rely on unfriendly foreign countries  for our energy, like Venezuela and the  Middle Eastern dictators, by depriving  Americans of a reliable source of oil at  a time when gas prices are around $4,  or they can work with our friends in  the north to supply over 1.4 million  barrels of oil per day.  Pipelines are the proven and safe, efficient source of energy. Best of all,  this project creates thousands of jobs  at a time when unemployment in this  country is 9.2 percent. And it is climbing. I would think this job-creating,  shovel-ready project—which my liberal  friends always talk about—would be  something they would support and the  administration would support.  As the administration continues to  stonewall our own domestic production, we must safely and immediately  look for ways to meet energy needs.  The country needs energy. It needs  jobs. This project provides both. What’s  the holdup, Mr. President?  For every barrel of oil  shipped a  thousand miles, less than one teaspoon  of liquid is lost from a pipeline. Transporting goods by pipeline has the lowest carbon footprint as compared with  other transportation modes. Crude oil  has to get to America some way. It either comes by barge or truck or rail or  marine, and pipelines historically are  the safest way to transport crude oil.  Attacking  a  pipeline  on  environmental grounds seems to be absurd to  me. Pipelines have been the most cost-  effective and environmentally  sound  way to transport oil and natural gas. A  medium-sized pipeline, which is about  150,000 barrels a day, requires operating  more than 750 trucks or a 75-car train  every  day  to  transport  the  same  amount of crude oil.  Transporting oil through a pipeline is  far safer than using transportation by  oil tankers. When an oil tanker has a  major oil spill, millions of barrels of oil  can be spilled in a matter of a few minutes, a few hours, or just a few days.  Nearly half a million miles of natural  gas and crude oil pipelines are in the  United States—500,000 miles of pipeline. Over half of these are in the State  of Texas alone—270,000 miles of pipeline. And about one-third of all of the  Nation’s pipelines,  I understand, go  through  the  energy  capital  of  the  world, my district in southeast Texas.  If we don’t use the crude oil from  Canada in this pipeline, the Canadians  could very easily, instead of having a  north-to-south pipeline, have a pipeline  east-to-west and pipe it to the west  coast, and then ship it to our good buddies, the Chinese, who want to buy it.  You know, America’s energy plan  seems to be twofold: send money to  Brazil and let the Brazilians drill off  their coast, and we’ll buy their crude  oil; and the second part is, make sure  we use those cute little curly CFL light  bulbs. And that’s it.  It’s time that we take care of ourselves. This is a good project for America, American jobs, and a way to get  crude oil into the United States. It’s  time for the White House to make a decision.  And that’s just the way it is.  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2011

510,4,2011-07-28,Mr. DEFAZIO.," With one simple vote  last December, Congress precipitated  the so-called debt crisis. We voted to  extend all of the Bush tax cuts at a  cost of $4 trillion over 10 years. I voted  ‘‘no.’’  So now, the debate comes down to  what’s more important to the American people—Social Security or  tax  cuts; Medicare or tax cuts; jobs or tax  cuts. That’s what this debate  is all  about right now—preserving tax cuts,  particularly tax cuts for the wealthy  and the largest multinational corporations in this country.  Some are still trying to drag Social  Security into this debate. Social Security did not cause one penny of this  debt. In fact, Social Security is the  largest owner of Federal debt in the  world. They’re the largest investor in  Federal debt. Social Security did not  cause this problem. Yes,  long term,  starting in 2037, Social Security is projected to only be able to pay 73 to 75  percent of benefits. We can solve that  simply. Ask all Americans to pay the  same percent of their income into Social Security.  Today, if you earn over $106,800, you  pay a lower percentage of your income  into Social Security. Lift that cap. You  could lower the tax for everybody. All  those who  earn  less  than  $106,800,  they’d get a little tax cut. Everybody  who earns more than $106,800 would pay  the same percent of their income in  taxes as those who earn less. That’s  fair. It solves Social Security’s problems forever.  Then there are others who say well,  it’s Medicare. Medicare  is the thing  we’ve got to kill. The Ryan plan, the  Republican plan: kill Medicare. Turn it  into a voucher program. That’s their  solution there. Future seniors would  have a subsidy to go to a government-  sponsored  exchange  to  buy  private  health  insurance,  and  the  voucher  would be  far  less  than  the cost of  health insurance. We don’t need to kill  Medicare to save it or to preserve the  tax cuts.  Medicare, we could do away with the  Bush-Republican unpaid-for  prescription-drug benefit that subsidizes the  pharmaceutical and  insurance  industries and instead say Medicare, we’ll  negotiate lower drug prices for all people on that program and give them an  at-cost benefit. That saves $20 billion a  year.  We could reform the way we buy durable medical equipment and save another $20 billion a year. And then we  could move on to paying doctors for  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:49 Jul 29, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A28JY7.002 H28JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 B Y O S 8 G K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011

512,12,2011-07-28,Mr. OLVER.," Mr. Speaker, today we  face an unnecessary crisis. The debt  limit has never before been held hostage by any political party, because it  is in every American’s best interest to  protect the credit of the United States;  but now ideologues in Congress have  hijacked this issue, and have pushed  our Nation to the brink of default in  rejecting all offers of compromise.  Calls for massive spending cuts, and  spending cuts alone, without raising  any revenues whatsoever are irresponsible at least and deliberately destructive at worst. They would default on  our debt, causing a global financial crisis, rather than see hedge fund managers, corporate  jet owners or phenomenally profitable oil companies pay  higher taxes. Their call for fiscal responsibility rings hollow, and the fiscal  history of the last three decades shows  that.  This  chart  shows  the  growth  America’s national debt since 1980.  At the end of the Carter administration, the national debt was less than $1  trillion. Twelve years later, with President Reagan’s 8 years and the  first  President Bush’s 4 years, the national  debt had grown by more than 300 perof  cent—it had quadrupled—and we were  mired in debt. The Reagan-Bush economic policies greatly  increased the  debt and led to soaring deficits and rising interest rates. It ended in a recession.  In 1993, President Clinton was under  severe pressure from the very Republicans who had meekly  followed the  two Republican Presidents  as  they  raised the national debt by over 300  percent. President Clinton championed  a balanced austerity program with,  roughly, equal spending cuts and revenue increases—the Clinton years. Republicans in both the House and Senate  voted unanimously against that program, arguing it would cost jobs and  cause a recession, but the exact opposite occurred. More than 20 million jobs  were created under the Clinton administration, and each of the last three  budgets of the Clinton Presidency produced a surplus. Those three budgets  were the only budgets and surplus in  the last 40 years, and Clinton’s balanced program  is  considered highly  successful  by  economists. President  Clinton  raised  taxes  on  those who  could afford it and reduced spending to  shrink our deficit, and the economy  grew by leaps and bounds.  The fiscal record of the second President Bush is a record of utter irresponsibility.  It began with massive  tax  cuts,  skewed  sharply  toward  the  wealthy, and with trillions of dollars  spent on two long, unpopular wars—all  of that paid for by borrowing. It ended  in the Great Recession, caused by the  collapse  of  an unregulated housing  market which was  fueled  by Wall  Street greed. President Bush turned  President Clinton’s surplus into more  than 5 trillion additional dollars added  to our national debt—all the way up to  here—almost doubling the debt again.  President Obama was  inaugurated  during the worst month of job losses in  the Great Recession and cannot be  blamed for what happened before, but  the  recovery has  stalled, and we’re  short 12 million jobs.  History has shown us what works and  what doesn’t. The Reagan-Bush economics led to hugely increased debt.  The Clinton economics eliminated the  deficit  and  accelerated  economic  growth, but it required some sacrifice  by all Americans to fix the national  problem.  Now Republicans want to slash social  programs, gut Medicare and Social Security  benefits,  and  further  reduce  taxes for the wealthiest few. The Republicans threaten default on our debt.  The only plan they offer would add  hundreds of thousands of people to the  unemployment  lines  by  eliminating  jobs in the public sector. They would  protect the wealthiest few at the expense of the entire country. They offer  no plan to create jobs and no long-term  solution. Yet America needs a  long-  term solution, and that must include  spending  reduction and  revenue  increase in balanced proportion.  b1140  DEBT CEILING HOSTAGE  ",2011

514,12,2011-07-28,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  the elaborate Kabuki dance continues  here on Capitol Hill surrounding the  angst about increasing the debt ceiling.  I think what we are seeing can be summarized in three words: ‘‘recklessness,’’  ‘‘abuse,’’ and ‘‘hypocrisy.’’  First of all, it is reckless for my Republican friends to hold the debt ceiling discussions hostage in an attempt  to achieve other political goals. There  have already been  significant costs.  American  currency  has  weakened.  We’ve watched a slide of the stock market since last Friday when the agreement blew up as Speaker BOEHNER  walked away from his work with President Obama. We’ve watched premiums  being paid now to ensure United States  debt. People are making adjustments  that are having  consequences  right  now and eroding the confidence that we  have had globally in the strength of  American  commitments  to  pay  its  debt—a confidence that has resulted in  record  low-interest  rates  that have  benefited  everybody  in  the United  States, and that is at risk.  The irony is that there is no reason  for this to occur. We have increased the  debt ceiling 102 times since this unusual little law was enacted in 1917.  The United States, you recall, is one of  only two countries in the entire world  that goes through this charade of having to vote to finance spending that  we’ve already done.  It has always been routine. We did  this routinely for President Bush. The  irony is now when we are facing another adjustment in the debt ceiling,  ironically most of the debt, $9.5 billion,  was incurred as a direct result of the  policies of the two Presidents Bush and  Ronald Reagan. There is a great little  chart on page A–14 in today’s New York  Times that outlines this.  Instead of making  it  routine and  making whatever pontification people  will do on the floor of the House, which  they have done since 1917, now all of a  sudden we have  thrown  a monkey  wrench into the process. We’ve raised  the specter of default. We’re having  people  speculate  whether  there’s  enough money to go to August 2 or August 5. We’re speculating about what  debts, what bills the President will  pay.  The  irony  is that this Republican  recklessness  is actually  empowering  the President of the United States to  make decisions about whether to pay  Chinese creditors or honor our obligations to senior citizens or people who  do business with the United States.  Absolutely outrageous.  Wouldn’t you think Congress would  like to make these decisions rather  than punting to the President? Well,  no.

516,20,2011-07-28,Mr. NUGENT.," I thank the chairman  of the Rules Committee, the gentleman  from California,  for allowing me to  speak on this topic.  We have an obligation to ensure that  government doesn’t default on its debts  for the first time in history. I’ve always said that America is a country  that keeps her promises, and  those  promises include our debts. The Senate  hasn’t  acted. The President  hasn’t  acted. So today, the House is considering yet another  solution  to keep  these promises. I’m not just talking  about promises to our creditors. If we  default, we break promises to our seniors, to our troops, and to our veterans.  Such a scenario, in my view, is just totally unacceptable.  b 1300  The Budget Control Act is a way forward. It’s a down payment on serious  spending reforms. It’s cuts now, and  it’s more cuts in the future. Most importantly, it requires both chambers of  Congress to vote on a balanced budget  amendment to the Constitution.  Future cuts and future spending caps  are all well and good, but they don’t  hold our feet to the fire. We all know,  if the Federal Government wants to  spend money, they will do it. They’ve  proven that time and time again. The  Budget Control Act recognizes that we  can’t keep  spending what we don’t  have, which is why it requires Congress  to vote on a balanced budget amendment.  It’s a new promise to the American  people—a promise that we are going to  do better, a promise that we will only  spend what we collect.  President Obama says he wants a balanced approach. What we want, what  the American people want, is a balanced budget. The President has done  plenty of telling us what he won’t do.  What President Obama hasn’t told us is  what he will do. What President Obama  has are his speeches. Speeches aren’t  plans.  A plan is what we have here in front  of us today. It’s a good plan. Could it  be better? All of us on this side of the  aisle believe it could be. We passed a  resolution of Cut, Cap, and Balance,  but that died in the Senate. So, today,  we are talking about what is going to  move this country  forward, what  is  going to set us up on a path of sustainable  spending, not what we’re  currently living with, which is an addiction. We have a spending addiction in  the United States.  ",2011

521,20,2011-07-28,Mr. MARKEY.," The Republican Party’s deficit plan is very simple: one,  prolong the default crisis; two, push  the Nation to the very brink of economic collapse;  three,  repeat  it all  again and again until election day 2012.  The Republican Party  cares  only  about  political  victory. They  don’t  want compromise. They want capitulation.  And if America goes into default, it  will be your fault.  We now have the pluperfect form of  the Republican Party’s political paradox: Republicans hate government,  but they have to run for office in order  to make sure it doesn’t work. In 1995  and  ’96,  the Republican Party  shut  down the Federal Government. In 1997  and ’98, the Republicans shut down the  Congress over  impeachment. Earlier  this year,  they  threatened  to  shut  down the Federal Government again  unless they got an extension of tax  cuts for the very rich.  And now Republicans are trying to  shut down the entire economy. Republicans are turning Americans into the  laughingstock of the world.  If our Nation defaults, it will devastate Americans all across the country.  If you have an adjustable rate  mortgage, you will pay more. If you  have a credit card, you will pay more.  If you have a small business, you will  pay more.  This Republican default will impose  a Tea Party tax on the entire country.  It will force Americans to pay billions  more of their hard-earned money when  they can least afford it. The Tea Party  has congressional Republicans wrapped  around  its  little  finger, but  it’s the  American people who are going to get  squeezed.  The  Republican  Party  doesn’t care. After all, it was the Bush  administration and congressional Republicans who put us on this course in  the first place.  The only way to end this historic  nightmare is to resolve another massive deficit—the leadership deficit in  the Republican Party.  ",2011
522,20,2011-07-28,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume to  say to my very good friend from Massachusetts that, as I listen to those remarks, I am really struck by the fact  that our view is that we’re in this together, and I will say for the record  that we care about absolutely everything that my friend said we don’t care  about.  We as a Nation have a challenge that  needs to be addressed in a bipartisan  way. The measure that  is before us  today is one that was—and I underscore the word ‘‘was’’—agreed to by the  Senate majority leader, HARRYREID,  and by the Speaker of the House of  Representatives, JOHNBOEHNER. Now, I  know that Senator REID is not at this  juncture supportive of this measure;  but it’s important to note that we need  to bring about greater spending cuts.  I know that I speak for most all of  my Republican colleagues when I say  that this is really the beginning of a  process towards reducing the size and  scope and reach of government. We feel  passionately about the need to expand  individual  initiative and opportunity  in this country, and to characterize us  as doing nothing but wanting to close  down the government and being controlled by  some outside group, Mr.  Speaker, we as Republicans want to  work in a bipartisan way because we  recognize that Barack Obama  is the  President of the United States and that  the Democrats have control  in  the  United  States  Senate.  That’s why  Speaker BOEHNER has worked  diligently in pursuing the goals and the  priorities that we have, but at the  same time, he has recognized that we  can’t get it all.  No one is happy with this measure  that is before us. Speaker BOEHNER is  not happy with this measure that is before us, but he understands that we  have to ensure that we don’t see the  Nation go over the brink and that we  do, in fact, increase the debt ceiling,  but his goal has been to get to the root  cause.  As we’ve now found out, 75 times the  debt ceiling has been increased since  1962.

540,44,2011-07-28,Ms. EDWARDS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition to the underlying bill. This  is nothing more  than political posturing by  the Republican majority.  And  I  think  it’s  important  for  the  American people to understand that  this majority has asked us time and  time again to vote to end Medicare, to  cut Social Security, to cut Medicaid,  and they’re doing  it once again. No  question about it. What’s being offered  up by this majority is nothing short of  recklessness, absolutely nothing.  The Speaker  and  the Republican  Party know that the President and the  Senate are going to reject the bill. I  don’t even know why we’re here on this  floor, Mr. Speaker. Rather than spending the last several months developing  a real plan that would avoid default,  the Republicans have  spent months  stripping away health care protections,  attacking the EPA, jeopardizing jobs,  not creating  jobs. And here we are,  once again, ready to end Medicare, Social Security, cut away Medicaid benefits, and attack the most vulnerable in  our communities.  I have to say, Mr. Speaker,  if  it  weren’t sad, it would be laughable. The  plan would require $2.7 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years,  cut $915 billion at the offset, and another $1.8 trillion in December. They’re  coming after Americans’ Social Security  checks.  They’re  coming  after  Medicare. They’re coming after Medicaid. That’s what  this majority  is  doing. Let’s not be fooled by it. It’s  time for the American people to stand  up.  The bill threatens our ability to pay  our obligations. They’re not interested  in paying our obligations. These are  debts that we’ve already incurred. And  yet they won’t take the money that  they’ve given away to the wealthiest 2  percent of this country. No, they can’t  give up theirs. The oil and gas companies can’t give up theirs. The companies that have offshored jobs can’t give  up theirs; but they’re asking the American people to sacrifice Social Security, Medicare, education, Medicaid.  It’s unfair, and we won’t stand for it.  ",2011
541,44,2011-07-28,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 10 seconds to say to my very  good  friend  from Maryland, she has  just adequately, very accurately described the measure that has been proposed by the Senate majority leader,  HARRYREID.  With that, I am happy to yield 1  minute to my very good friend from  Lafayette, Louisiana (Mr. BOUSTANY), a  hardworking member of the Ways and  Means Committee.  ",2011
542,44,2011-07-28,Mr.  BOUSTANY.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  think there was a gross distortion of  what’s being proposed here. And again,  the previous speaker just condemned  the Senate Majority Leader HARRY  REID’s bill in the U.S. Senate. That’s  the only Democratic bill we’ve had. So  it seems to me that there’s a little bit  of a fight going on on the other side of  the aisle between their House Members  and the Senate.  To my friend from New Jersey, this  committee  that’s  formed  is a committee of active sitting Members of the  House and Senate. So in order for anything to be recommended by this committee, it would require, in all likelihood, all of the Democrats to support  it.  ",2011

551,44,2011-07-28,Mr. CLYBURN.," I thank my friend for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, while the clock is ticking, the Republican majority is dickering and  the American people are  hurting. Our financial markets are on  pace for their worst week in nearly a  year. State governments are bracing  for downgrades in their borrowing capacities, and the gap between those in  our society who have a lot and those  who have very little is growing.  The Republican majority continues  their efforts to divert attention from  the self-inflicted crisis with manufactured controversies, holding the American economy hostage to their reckless  and  dispassionate  demands. As  the  clock ticks toward default and the pain  it would bring to middle-income families and those who aspire to become  middle income, my friends on the other  side continue to play politics. Speaker  does not even pretend that  this is a serious attempt to solve the  problem. He sold this bill to his conference by telling them that it wasn’t  bipartisan. And with divided government, a plan that isn’t bipartisan is no  plan at all. It’s just a game.  The President and the Democrats in  Congress as well as the American people have  advocated  a  balanced  approach to reduce the deficit by growing  the economy and protecting the most  vulnerable,  including Medicare, Medicaid,  and  Social  Security  beneficiaries. We have been willing to make  tough,  politically  difficult  compromises.  This bill on the floor today, just like  the bill from last week, is yet another  partisan time-waster. Our constituents  are not interested in any of us voting  to cut Medicare or cap Social Security  or balancing the budget on the backs of  Medicaid recipients. A 6-month extension is another waste of time.  We must resolve this matter now and  ensure the full faith and credit of the  United States. Let’s defeat the Boehner  bill.  ",2011

And now the same people  who’ve worked their way up  in the  leadership positions are saying, We’re  not going to pay the bill. This is irresponsible.  Let’s solve this in a balanced way,  and let’s ask for some shared sacrifice.  ",2011
562,52,2011-07-28,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself 2 minutes.  The gentleman, my friend over from  Maryland, keeps  talking  about  the  Reid plan, the Senate majority leader  over in the Senate. His plan. I’ve got  the CBO score, too. It says it’s a $2.7  trillion increase. That means it doesn’t  raise the debt limit less than we cut  spending, so it cuts less. But more importantly, $1.3 trillion of that money is  accounting  tricks  and  budget  gimmicks.  Mr. Speaker, the American people  are tired of all of the accounting tricks  and the budget gimmicks that go on in  Washington. Let me explain what $1.3  trillion of this does. It says that imagine that we’re at war for 10 years in Afghanistan and Iraq at surge levels. We  assume we’re going to be fighting this  war for 10 more years with over 100,000  troops  in Afghanistan and, oh gosh,  wait. We’re going  to withdraw our  troops in 2014. Trillion dollars in savings.  I’ve got a better idea. Let’s pass a  bill to cover the Moon with yogurt that  will cost $5 trillion today. And then  let’s pass a bill the next day to cancel  that bill. We could save $5 trillion.  Wait. I got a better idea. Our debt is  $14 trillion. Let’s come up with a new  plan to spend $14 trillion, then rescind  it the next day and let’s save $14 trillion.  This stuff is fiscal fantasy. You can’t  make this stuff up, Mr. Speaker. Suggesting that we’re going to be in a war  at these levels for 10 more years when  everybody knows we’ve already decided  not to do that, that does not get us $1.3  trillion in spending cuts. Only in Washington can you add up math like that.  We need real spending cuts.  ",2011

564,52,2011-07-28,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," I yield myself an additional minute to say this is  getting serious, Mr. Speaker, very serious. We can’t keep spending money we  just don’t have. Now 42 cents of every  dollar coming out of this place is borrowed money. It doesn’t just threaten  our  children and grandchildren any  more. It is hurting our economy today.  Half of that money is coming from  other countries  like China. Why on  Earth do we want to give the President  a blank check to keep doing that, giving our sovereignty and our self-determination to other countries to lend us  money to fund our government. Those  days have got to end.  This bill doesn’t cut as much as we  want. We passed a budget cut $6.2 trillion in real spending cuts. This cuts  about a trillion.  Let’s cut  this  trillion, bank  that  money, and then go cut some more.  That’s what we’re trying to do to be responsible.  The problem in this town is not that  we don’t tax Americans enough. The  problem  is we’re  spending way  too  much money.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011
565,52,2011-07-28,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Mr. Speaker, of  course we should be reducing the deficit. Of course we should make sure  that we don’t rely on the Chinese as  our bankers any more, which is why  it’s so ironic that our Republican colleagues refuse to cut subsidies for oil  companies by one penny for the purpose of reducing the deficit so we don’t  have to rely on borrowing from China  anymore.  In fact, if you look at Exxon’s quarterly profits today, they’re through the  roof. Now, I’m all for having Exxon  make money. But why  should  they  have taxpayer money on top of it? And  yet our Republican colleagues get up  here and they talk about how we’re dependent on China. But they don’t want  to break that dependency if it means  actually asking the top oil companies  to get rid of their subsidies for the purpose of deficit reduction. So let’s get  serious.  Now, with respect to the plan that  has been put forward by Senator REID.  I  listened to my colleague. I would  point out to the body that if you look  at the Republican budget and the documents that accompanied it when they  pointed out what their savings were  relative to the CBO baseline, they also  show a trillion dollars in savings from  the global war on terror. As my friend  the chairman knows, that is a function  of the way the Congressional Budget  Office scores.  But it is also a fact that when the  Republican budget was presented, they  presented it both relative to the President’s baseline and the congressional  budget baseline. I would further make  the point that even if you took that off  the table, the proposal by Senator REID  cuts  immediately more on  spending  than the Republican proposal before us  today, the difference being he doesn’t  keep  the economy hanging under a  cloud for 5 months and make this country go through this exercise just by the  end of December.  With that, I would yield 1 minute to  the distinguished Member of Congress  from Illinois (Mr. JACKSON).  ",2011
566,52,2011-07-28,Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.," Soon my  colleagues will be quoting Dr. King’s ‘‘I  Have a Dream’’ speech, and here’s a  quote they will not read and they will  ignore: ‘‘In a sense, we’ve come to our  Nation’s Capital to cash a check. When  the architects of our Republic wrote  the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory  note to which every American was to  fall heir. This note was a promise that  all men, yes, black men as well as  white men, would be guaranteed the  ‘unalienable rights’ of ‘life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness.’  ‘‘It  is obvious today that America  has defaulted on this promissory note  in so far as her citizens of color are  concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the  people a bad check, a check which has  come  back  marked  ‘insufficient  funds.’’’  But we refuse to believe that the  bank of justice is bankrupt. The problem, Mr. Chairman,  is not that we  spend. It’s that we don’t honor our obligations. We are a Nation that spends  billions of dollars to put a man on the  Moon,  fund the war  in Afghanistan,  fund the war in Iraq, but we can’t find  the money in this Congress to put a  man on his own two feet right here in  America.  And there is something more fundamental, Mr. Speaker, that is going on  here. This President is being treated  differently than other Presidents. No  other President has been ‘‘stook up,’’  shook down, or held hostage as this  President of the United States over  this debt vote. This is fundamentally  unfair, Mr. Speaker,  to change  the  rules in the middle of the game.  ANNOUNCEMENTBYTHESPEAKERPROTEMPORE  ",2011

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 2244, which designates a  post office in Geneva, New York, as the  Corporal Steven Blaine Riccione Post  Office.  I introduced this legislation to extend long overdue recognition to a national hero from the 24th Congressional  District.  Corporal Steven Riccione was a native of Geneva, New York. He was a Geneva High School graduate who volunteered to join the Army in 1967 during  the Vietnam War.  While on a search and destroy mission with his platoon in Vietnam, Corporal Riccione  came  under  intense  enemy fire and became pinned down.  Riccione, then a private, saw a machine gunner in his platoon get wounded. As Major General E.M. Strong described  in his October 1967 account:  ‘‘Private Riccione, with complete disregard for his own safety, rushed from  his covered position through a vicious  hail of enemy fire to aid his wounded  comrade.  ‘‘He continuously exposed himself to  the withering hail of enemy fire, standing up at times, to place effective fire  on enemy positions. When his weapon  was struck by an enemy bullet and was  demolished, he undauntedly picked up  a machine gun and charged an enemy  bunker, killing two enemy soldiers.  ‘‘Shortly after, Private Riccione was  mortality wounded while helping  to  evacuate  wounded  personnel  under  heavy enemy fire.  ‘‘Private Riccione’s devotion to duty  and personal courage were in keeping  with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit  upon himself and the United States  Army.’’  Corporal Riccione was killed in action while helping to evacuate wounded  American soldiers.  As a result of Private Riccione’s actions, Major  General  Strong  recommended him  for the Bronze Star  Medal with Valor Device,  and  the  Bronze Star Medal with First Oak Leaf  Cluster, which he was posthumously  awarded. He was also promoted to corporal.  Mr. Speaker, Corporal Riccione is a  source of great pride to his family, his  community  in Geneva, my congressional district, and indeed to a grateful  Nation.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation so that Corporal Riccione’s  memory may be honored in his own  hometown of Geneva, New York, for  generations to come.  ",2011

583,76,2011-07-28,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, the  clock is ticking. In just a few days, the  U.S. Government will no longer have  the ability to borrow money to pay its  bills—a situation the President and his  advisers  said would  trigger an economic Armageddon.  I was shocked last night when 53 Senate Democrats issued a letter saying  they intend to vote against the only  piece of legislation that has any chance  of preventing all this from happening.  Even more shocking is the fact that  Democratic leaders and the President  himself have endorsed every feature of  this legislation except one, and that is  the fact that it doesn’t allow the President to avoid another national debate  about spending and debt until after the  next Presidential election. Every other  feature of the House bill was essentially agreed to earlier except for one—  the President wants to avoid having  another discussion about deficit and  debt before the election. This assurance is the only thing the President  and Senate Democrats are holding out  for right now.  The Democrats can try to  justify  their opposition to the House bill any  way they want. They can claim they  are  worried  about  a  stalemate  6  months from now. They can ignore the  fact that of the 31 times Congress and  the President have  raised  the debt  limit over the past 25 years, 22 of those  debt limit increases lasted less than a  year. President Reagan, in 1984, signed  three bills in the course of his election  year that raised the debt ceiling. It was  not unusual. In fact, what is unusual is  to ask for $2.7 trillion in debt limit increase. That is unusual. That is unprecedented.  So what is worse, a default now or a  potential default 6 months down the  road? Because if those 53 Senate Democrats follow through on their threat to  filibuster the House bill, that is what  they will be doing—ensuring default  now rather than working with us to  prevent it later. Why would you want  to do that? The answer is, to make the  President’s reelection campaign a little bit easier.  It is inconceivable to me that the  President  would  actually  follow  through on this threat. After all, the  President’s first responsibility is to do  what is best for the country, not his reelection campaign. The same goes for  our friends on the other side of the  aisle. It is inconceivable to me that  they would actually block the only bill  that would get through the House of  Representatives and prevent a default  right now. Inconceivable. It is inconceivable to me that they would do this  for no other reason than to help the  President avoid having another debate  before the election about the need for  Washington to get its fiscal house in  order. But that is precisely what we  may be headed for this weekend—guaranteed default or a bill that takes the  specter of a default off the table, while  giving us another opportunity to address the very deficits and debts that  caused this crisis in the first place.  Senate Democrats are playing with  fire, and it is hard to conclude they are  doing it for any other reason than politics. So I urge our friends on the other  side  of  the  aisle  this morning  to  rethink their position and join Republicans in preventing default.  f  RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

590,92,2011-07-28,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President, I  think it is obvious to the world around  us that the atmosphere here is hardly  one of comfort or  satisfaction. The  public does not see the agony of the debate that is taking place, as we watch  how dysfunctional the discussion about  the national debt has been.  We feel the threat to America’s world  financial  leadership  that  is  lurking  around here, and it is not very satisfying to those people whose homes are  close to foreclosure or the people who  need to be assured that health care is  going to be there for them or that their  child who can learn can get an education without mortgaging their future  or cannot even get a mortgage on that.  So we look around and we watch and  we listen and we see that the Republicans  in the House and the Republicans in the Senate are in a search for  political gain regardless of the cost to  our society and our Nation.  I do not make this statement casually. But after months of watching  and listening to the targeted goal of  politics over the pain that could follow  a default, no other conclusion may be  drawn. We want to consider the evidence. By way of example, Vice President  convened  a  bipartisan  working group to find solutions to get  the national debt problem over with,  get it resolved, and let us go on to our  normal and needed debate and business. After that, Republicans walked  out. Walked out.  Next, President Obama offered Republicans what he  called a  ‘‘grand  deal’’ that would reduce the deficit by  $4 trillion. Republicans ran away. Now  our majority leader, HARRYREID, has  proposed a plan that  includes more  than $2 trillion in spending cuts, $1 in  cuts for every dollar the debt limit is  increased—and not even insisting on a  dollar of revenues, which has been suggested several times.  But  there  is  no way  of  getting  through the obstinacy on the other  side. Republicans turn their back time  after time. Democrats in this Senate  and in the White House have offered  the  Republicans  compromise  after  compromise. But they do not see their  target. Their target is to do damage to  the Obama administration so that it  hurts  sufficiently  to  discount  the  progress that has been made for our society under President Obama.  Time and time again the Republicans  have changed their demands to  find  reasons to say no. Are we asking the  Republicans to do something radical,  something that has never been done before? That is certainly not the case.  Over the past half century, the debt  ceiling has been raised 75 times, almost  two-thirds of those occasions under Republican Presidents. In fact, the debt  ceiling was increased 18 times under  President Reagan, and 7 times under  President George W. Bush.  Our country has never defaulted. So  the question that must be raised is:  What is different about today? Why, at  a time when we already face a real jobs  crisis  in this country, would Republicans plan for another economic crisis? Why would they do that? Will destroying the economy help Republicans  win seats next year when people across  our  country  are  already  expressing  their dissatisfaction with the deadlock  they see being displayed?  We heard the minority leader say his  No. 1 priority is stopping the President  from winning another term. What a  goal that is. He is our President, elected by the people of the country. He has  a term of 4 years and will be up for reelection. We hope and we pray that he  continues to be the President of our  country. What good does it do to target  the system?  Make known what it is they stand  for. So  far we have seen that they  stand for nothing that is helpful to the  average American. So what we need is  a chance to have an honest discussion.  Insecurity reigns as people grow more  and more conscious about their inability to afford the basics of life, jobs,  health care, education. They see prices  being raised around them as their purchasing power shrinks. Look at the  price of gasoline. You see a perfect example of what is happening. We had  one Republican Presidential candidate  who was asked:  ‘‘Does it strike you  that as the unemployment rate goes up  your chances of winning office also go  up?’’  Do you know what her answer was?  She said, ‘‘I hope so.’’ Hope so. What an  outrageous thing to say from the halls  of government, the high halls of government. I hope so. I hope that unemployment goes up, says she, so she  might have a chance to win office. How  cruel that statement is.  Make  no mistake,  if  the United  States Treasury runs out of cash next  week, the principal burden will fall on  middle-class families. But the effects  on our  total economy will be devastating as well. We may not be able to  send out Social Security checks to seniors, benefit checks to veterans, the  people who serve the country. Let’s  stop paying them? Or paychecks to the  men and women who now bear our  country’s uniform in Afghanistan and  Iraq. Sorry, we cannot pay you. Is that  what we are going to say?  Interest rates could rise almost immediately, greatly increasing the cost  of mortgages, car loans, student loans,  credit cards, you name it. If middle-  class Americans think their 401(k) plan  suffered during the Wall Street crisis a  few years ago, imagine what will happen to the markets if the U.S. Government cannot pay its bills, or redeem  bonds that are ordinarily turned in for  cash.

595,100,2011-07-28,Mr. PRYOR.," Madam President, our  greatest Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, in his drive to end slavery, said ‘‘a house divided against itself  cannot stand.’’ With these few words,  Lincoln is calling to us through the  echoing halls of history. He is calling  for us to put aside our differences and  to become unified into one people, one  Nation, one common purpose.  Mr. Lincoln recognized that the issue  of slavery was tearing this great Nation apart and that it could not survive  half slave and half free. Slavery was  the great unfinished business of our  Founders. The  institution of slavery  was so ingrained in the infant country’s past and future that even Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and  Franklin could not disentangle it. I am  not trying to equate carrying too much  debt with slavery, please understand  that, but the truth remains. A house  divided against itself cannot stand.  This house, this Nation, this Republic,  is  divided  against  itself.  Our  Founders called their effort at establishing a new Nation ‘‘a great experiment’’—and it has been. Nothing like it  had ever been tried and America has  been the unequaled success in all of  world history. Truly, we are the envy  of the world. We began as 13 weak and  barely united States but quickly became  the  strongest  country  in  the  Western Hemisphere. About 70 years  after we adopted the Constitution, we  survived a deadly Civil War. All the  while we grew in stature and in favor  with  other  nations.  Our  economic  power grew rapidly. American  influence grew as we became the agent of  democracy and capitalism for the entire world. Although  our military  power was slow to develop, we fought  on the winning side in two world wars  and we grew into an economic, military and cultural super power.  We are a Nation of immigrants, of  many faiths, of many races and our national  call  to union  is E Pluribus  Unum. Out of many, one. Out of many  States  is  forged one Nation. Out of  many races is forged one people. Out of  many, one. The Founding Fathers had  to balance the agrarian interests of the  South and West with the industrial and  shipping  interests of the North and  East. They balanced small States and  big  States.

598,108,2011-07-28,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, before  turning to the issue of the moment, I  want to thank my dear friend for his  good remarks here on the floor of the  Senate. He is a great leader, a great  human being, and he certainly outlined, I think in a fair way, some of the  problems and some of the solutions we  might have here on the floor.  But before turning to the issue of the  moment, the need to restore the Nation’s fiscal stability by reducing our  deficits and debt, I want to return to a  matter I discussed on the floor yesterday, and that is the FAA reauthorization bill.  I must respond to some of the comments made by two of my colleagues  earlier  today  regarding  one  of  the  major sticking points in our efforts to  pass  the FAA  reauthorization  bill.  Their arguments are, to put it quite  simply, fallacious and cannot go unanswered.  As you might expect,  these comments were regarding the provision in  the House bill affecting the way votes  are counted in union elections in the  airline  industry. My colleagues,  the  senior Senator from West Virginia and  the junior Senator from Iowa, characterize the House’s actions as some sort  of  radical  endeavor, a  change  that  lacks justification and common sense.  In fact, the Senator from West Virginia even argued that the House’s provisions would ‘‘undo 75 years of labor  law.’’  These were his exact words. Well,  nothing  could  be  further  from  the  truth. In fact, the claim is so far from  being accurate I simply have to assume  that my good friend, Senator ROCKEFELLER, simply misspoke. I know this  is the line the labor unions and the administration are peddling, but here is  the truth: The House of Representatives or Senate Republicans are not  trying to undo 75 years of labor law, it  is the National Mediation Board—or  NMB, I will call it—that has already  done so in a highly partisan fashion.  It  is the NMB, controlled by pro-  union appointees of President Obama  that  in a partisan way unilaterally  undid 75 years of labor law, and put  their finger on the scale for the unions  that  bankroll  Democratic  political  campaigns.  I know what I am talking about. I  won the American Jurisprudence prize  for labor law. I have led labor fights on  the floor for our side for the last 35  years. House and Senate Republicans  are only trying to restore long-lasting  labor law following its highly partisan  corruption by the National Mediation  Board. This is not an opinion. This is  fact.  Put  the  talking  points  and  revisionist history aside, this is what you  have: a highly partisan NMB changing  75 years of settled law, settled labor  law, to benefit the Democrats’ political  allies. For 75 years, NMB-supervised  elections required that a union receive  the votes of a majority of the entire  workforce before  it can be certified.  That has been the law. There is good  reason for it. This was not just a mathematical trick to disadvantage unions,  as my colleagues have argued. It  is  plain common sense.  Let’s suppose, for example, that only  50 percent of a proposed bargaining  unit votes in a union election, and the  union wins by a very slim majority of  the votes cast. In that case, a union  representative would be certified with  only the demonstrated support of one-  fourth of the bargaining unit. That is  what would happen if we follow the  language the NMB fallaciously put into  their ruling. One-quarter of a workforce could vote to certify a union and  bind every other coworker to have to  live with that decision. Apparently a  commitment to Democratic and true  majority rule only matters to the left  when it suits them. What is going on in  this country is outrageous, not just at  the National Mediation Board but the  NLRB as well. Democratic  radicals,  very brilliant  labor  lawyers, who do  not give a darn about what the law is,  are now starting to change the laws by  regulatory fiat.  Apparently a commitment to democratic and true majority rule only matters when it suits certain people’s politics.  The Senator  from  Iowa  compared  these votes to Senate and schoolboard  elections, suggesting that only a majority of those voting is necessary to  prevail. This is a misguided comparison. First, union elections are not a  choice among competing  representatives. They are, instead, held to determine whether the workers want to be  represented at all. Even setting that  aside,  how many  schoolboards  are  going to be empowered to make decisions that affect every hour of every  day an employee goes to work? How  many Senators are elected to serve a  small, narrowly defined group of constituents? And, in the end, if your vote  is  not  counted  in  a  Senate  or  schoolboard election, you will get another chance to vote a few years down  the line.  Employees  voting  in  these  union  elections have no such options. That is  why the law has been completely different from what my two friends and  colleagues have said on the floor. Requiring the support of the majority of  the whole unit  before  certifying  a  union representative only makes common sense. This is why the procedure  at NMB used for these elections went  unchanged  for  75 years. Boards appointed by Democratic Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Johnson, Carter, and  Clinton all agreed with that process  that the House bill is only attempting  to restore.  In fact, the NMB appointed by President Carter unanimously ruled it did  not have authority to administratively  change the form of the NMB’s ballot  used in representation elections, and  that such a change, if appropriate, can  only be made by Congress. That makes  sense.  Yet today we have an administration  bent on greasing the rails in favor of  the unions, and a Democratic Senate  all too willing to go along with  it.  They are so willing that they have  opted to stall passage of the FAA reauthorization to prevent Congress from  restoring a system that served the Nation and airline industry well for decades. This is another example of the  administration showing its true colors.  Rather than provide certainty to travelers, the transportation industry, and  airports, they are holding up a long-  term FAA reauthorization in order to  benefit their union allies. It is wrong.  This type of thing should not go on.  Nor  should  the National Mediation  Board be issuing what ought to be congressional decisions.

599,116,2011-07-28,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring the  memory of Dr. Donald Linker of Marin  County, who passed away on June 16,  2011. Dr. Linker dedicated his personal  and professional life to helping others  and was passionate about living his life  to the fullest.  Donald Linker was born and raised in  Louisville, KY. He graduated from the  University of Michigan and received  his doctor of medicine from the University of Kentucky, School of Medicine.  Don served honorably  in the U.S.  Navy as a doctor treating marines in  Vietnam. After his service, he moved  to San Francisco, married, and had  three children. He opened his own medical practice and after many years of  practicing medicine, returned to school  and  received his master’s  in public  health from UC Berkeley.  Don Linker was an activist and philanthropist who was  committed  to  bettering his community. He was a  founding member of the Foundation for  Reed Schools  in Tiburon  and  also  served a number of other organizations, including the Jewish Community  Federation, the American Israel Public  Affairs Committee, the Marin Community Federation,  the Bernard Osher  Foundation, and the Buck Center for  Research and Aging.  Don was an adventurous man with a  fiery demeanor and an infectious spirit  who loved travel and extreme sports.  One of his passions was pushing himself  to  the  limit  physically. He  loved  windsurfing,  skiing,  and mountain  biking, and some of his greatest personal accomplishments involved those  activities.  Don was a friend who will be greatly  missed by all  those whose  lives he  touched.  I send my heartfelt sympathies to his  family, including his son Kevin Linker,  daughters Jodi Linker and Dana Linker, son-in-law Richard Steele, brother  Stephen Linker and his grandchildren  Lauren and Sarah Steele.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO JORDAN BURROUGHS  ∑",2011
600,116,2011-07-28,Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.," Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the best  collegiate wrestler in America, Jordan  Burroughs, who  is an All-American  from my alma mater, the University of  Nebraska-Lincoln.  Earlier this year Jordan was awarded  the Dan Hodge Trophy, which is often  referred to as the ‘‘Heisman Trophy of  wrestling.’’ This award  is named  in  honor  of  Dan  Hodge,  who  was  undefeated during his 3-year career at  the University of Oklahoma. The criteria considered for the Hodge Trophy,  according  to  the University of Nebraska, are the wrestler’s record, number of pins, dominance on the mat, past  credentials,  quality  of  competition,  sportsmanship, and heart.  Wrestling at 165 pounds, Jordan compiled an impressive 36-to-0 record this  last season and captured his second  crown  from  the National Collegiate  Athletic Association; his first was in  2009. Despite Nebraska facing one of  the toughest schedules in the Nation  this  year,  Jordan  had  only  three  matches this season which did not end  by pin, tech fall, or a major decision.  Congratulations also go to Nebraska’s head wrestling coach, Mark Manning, who recruited Jordan from Winslow  Township  High  School  in  Sicklerville, NJ, where Jordan was listed as  the  seventh best high  school  wrestler in the country. As Coach Manning says, ‘‘Winning the Hodge Trophy  puts Jordan in an elite group of wrestlers and makes a strong statement  about him as an athlete.’’  Most  recently,  Jordan  Burroughs  added to his list of impressive tournament wins by taking home his first  senior  international wrestling  gold  medal on July 17, 2011, at the Outstanding Ukrainian Wrestlers Memorial  International  in Kiev, Ukraine.  There will be other matches between  now and next year, but his ultimate  goal is to compete at the 2012 Summer  Olympics in London, England.  From  the Garden  State  to  the  Cornhusker State, Jordan Burroughs  makes us all proud as America’s best  collegiate wrestler of 2011. As a former  Husker, he will forever remain in the  hearts of Big Red fans everywhere who  will continue rooting for him wherever  his travels take him.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO PAMELA LYNNE  WELLER  ∑",2011
601,116,2011-07-28,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President,  today  I wish honor Pamela Lynne  Weller, legal special assistant to Commissioner Thomas H. Moore at the U.S.  Consumer Product Safety Commission,  CPSC. Ms. Weller is retiring after more  than 26 years of distinguished Federal  Government service.  Pamela was born in Baltimore and  has lived in Maryland for most of her  life. She graduated with honors from  the University of Maryland and  received her law degree from Georgetown  University.  Pamela began her Federal  service  during her  last year of  law school,  when she worked for Senator Lawton  Chiles on the Government in the Sunshine Act, Public Law 94–409, and later  for Senator Richard Stone. For part of  that time she actually worked for both  Senators simultaneously, for Senator  Chiles as part of a law school program  and as a salaried employee of Senator  Stone. After graduation, she continued  working for Senator Stone on a variety  of important issues through the end of  his term of office.  After  leaving Senator Stone,  she  went to work at the Civil Aeronautics  Board, CAB, as an assistant to board  member James Smith, as the agency  worked through the deregulation of the  national  air  transportation  system,  and then as it wound down its operations prior to being incorporated into  the Department of Transportation.  Following nearly 10 years of continuous government service, Pamela went  to work in the private sector, opening  her own law practice. She continued in  this line of work for over 11 years, specializing in family law and real estate  transactions.  In 1995, she went back into the public  service to become an assistant to Commissioner Thomas H. Moore at the U.S.  Consumer Product Safety Commission.  During her work  for Commissioner  Moore, the  longest serving Commissioner in the agency’s history, she advised him on all agency actions including rulemakings, enforcement actions  and administrative matters. Additionally, she served as acting chief of staff  during Commissioner Moore’s 9-month  stint as acting chairman of the agency  in 2001 and 2002. She also helped construct his 2007 legislative proposals to  Congress, a number of which were incorporated into the Consumer Product  Safety Improvement Act of 2008, Public  Law 110–314.  During her notable tenure at CPSC,  Ms. Weller has played a significant role  in protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury posed by consumer  products. On numerous occasions, she  has demonstrated inspiring leadership  and has always been considered a valued employee at the CPSC.  Mr. President, I am pleased to thank  Pamela Lynne Weller for her honorable  service to our Nation, and I wish her a  rewarding retirement.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his  secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  which were referred to the appropriate  committees.

602,132,2011-07-28,Mr. WU.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay  tribute to Craig Prosser, retiring city manager  of Tigard, Oregon. Craig has announced his  retirement at the end of July, capping a 35-  year career of distinguished service  to our  community.  Craig began serving Tigard in 1999 as finance director, and since 2005, as city manager. Craig’s accomplishments include the formation of the city’s first urban renewal district,  the Tigard-Lake Oswego Water Partnership,  as well as major improvements along Pacific  Highway. He also oversaw the opening of the  Westside Express Service Commuter line that  runs through Tigard. Craig’s foresight helped  to make Tigard an attractive place to live and  do  business.  Because  of  his  leadership,  Tigard was able to retain crucial city services  through one of the worst financial crises in our  country’s history.  Craig has been a consensus builder who  has always focused on the needs of the citizens, and he has worked tirelessly to address  their concerns. He has approached his work  with integrity and a true sense of dedication  while empowering staff and those around him.  In his retirement announcement Craig said, ‘‘I  would be willing to put the City of Tigard staff  up against any public workforce in the state, if  not the nation. The citizens of Tigard are fortunate to have such dedicated elected officials  and public employees working on  their behalf.’’  Former Oregon Governor Tom McCall once  said,  ‘‘Heroes are not giant statues  framed  against a red sky. They are people who say,  this is my community, and it is my responsibility to make it better.’’ Craig Prosser truly is  an American hero, for he has devoted much of  his life to making his community better.  It is my distinct honor to recognize Craig for  his outstanding service and for providing a heroic example to us all.  f  HONORING UNITED  STATES MARINE  LANCE  CORPORAL  CODY  JAMES ELLIOTT  HON. LOIS CAPPS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 28, 2011  ",2011
603,132,2011-07-28,Mrs. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  honor 21-year-old United States Marine Lance  Corporal Cody James Elliott of Pismo Beach,  California. On June 12, 2011, while out on patrol, LCPL Elliott ran  to help his Brother  in  Arms, Josh McDaniels, who had been injured  in an IED explosion. While en route to his fallen comrade—without regard for his own safety—LCPL Elliott was severely wounded by another  IED explosion. Every day, magnificent  men such as Cody shine on the battlefields of  honor, bringing their light of heroism and selflessness to the darkness of war—making us  all proud to be Americans. In the blast, LCPL  Cody  lost his  left  leg, broke his  tibia  in his  right leg, and lost one of his fingers. In just a  few short weeks, he has come a long way in  dealing with his wounds and  is moving  full  speed towards recovery. With the help of his  family, he continues to recover and show us  what it means to bravely serve our country. I  ask that this poem penned in his honor by Albert Caswell be placed in the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD.  RUNTOME  (By Albert Caswell)  All  Run . . .  Run to me . . .  On battlefields of honor bright . . .  There are but all of those who so carry the  fight!  All with their most magnificent light! To  win that day, to that night!

Which brings such tears to the Angel’s eyes!  As it was on the day in June, when Cody you  so ran . . . as your heart so swooned!  As your Brother Josh lay dying, as you ran  to him . . . not asking why then!  in your most magnificent  shades of  green, oh yea you United States Marine!

604,4,2011-08-26,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  honor the long and distinguished public service career of my dear friend Peter Douglas.  Peter is retiring after nearly 26 years as the  California Coastal Commission’s Executive Director, a post that he has held continuously  since 1985, longer than any other director of  a California State agency. In that time he has  done more than any other individual to shape  the California Coastal Commission and by extension  the California coast we know  today.  So I think it appropriate that we honor his vision, dedication, and  tenacity  in doing as  much as humanly possible to keep the California coast natural, open, and accessible.  Peter has always had a knack  for pulling  success  from  challenging  circumstances.  Peter’s Jewish mother gave birth to him while  living in Berlin, Germany, in 1942. His family  managed to escape to Mexico and then, in the  early 1950s, to the United States. Peter went  on to graduate from UCLA in 1965 and later  from  the UCLA  law school  in 1969. After a  brief law practice, Peter went to work for Assemblyman Alan Sieroty, a Democrat  from  Beverly Hills. And that is when I first met him  and where he really started his work as a troublemaker and paradigm shifter par excellence.  In the late 1950s, my father, the late State  Senator Fred Farr, authored an early version  of a California Coastal Act, but  the politics  were not yet  there  to support  its passage.  Peter helped change that by drafting an updated version of my  father’s  legislation  that  this time went to the voters as Proposition 20.  As part of the grass roots campaign to pass  Prop 20, Peter, with a little help from me and  some others, organized a coastal bike  ride  along the coast from far north to the Mexican  border. With Prop 20’s passage the California  Coastal Commission was born. Peter  then  went  to work  for  the Assembly Natural Resources Committee and the Select Committee  on Coastal Protection, from where he helped  draft  the 1976 California Coastal Act, which  made the Coastal Commission permanent and  set  in motion  the creation of  local coastal  plans and the other basic elements of California’s coastal protection framework.  Peter then went to work for the Commission  as its Chief Deputy, a position he held until his  1985 appointment as the Commission’s executive director. As Executive Director, Peter led  the Commission’s development  into  the bulwark of California coastal protection that it is  today. He has described the measure of his  success as the things that we don’t see: the  wetlands  left unfilled;  the scenic vistas  left  open; the coastal habitat still available for wildlife; and even the coastal amenities now open  to minorities. Others have measured his success with a catalogue of awards and recognition too long to detail here. Of course this has  not come without controversy. He has  frequently tangled with the rich and powerful over  various coastal development proposals and  has survived over a dozen attempts to remove  him.  Unfortunately, illness has done what lobbyists could not. His long running struggle with  cancer has forced Peter to step down from his  executive director position. I know I speak for  many of my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, in thanking Peter for his selfless service and in wishing him and his family and friends all the best.  f  TRIBUTE TO 70TH MCAFEE FAMILY  REUNION IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS  HON.

605,4,2011-08-26,Mr. GONZALEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues  to  join me  in honoring  the McAfee  family for celebrating their 70th family reunion  in San Antonio, Texas.  On Saturday, August 27, 2011, members of  the McAfee  family will gather at Rodriguez  City Park in San Antonio to celebrate a tradition of coming  together  that has  lasted 70  years. The McAfee Family Reunion began in  1941 with the family of William and Charlotte  Newton McAfee, and their nine children. This  year, four of the McAfee children from the initial reunion will be celebrating their 70th continuous  McAfee  Family  Reunion:  Harold  McAfee, Delton McAfee King, Doris McAfee  Walker, and Joseph McAfee.  At the core of American values is a commitment to family, and I want to thank all of the  members of the McAfee family for their incredible dedication to each other. They are truly a  model for families all across our great country,  and I am honored to have their family celebrate such a tremendous milestone in my district. The McAfee  family’s steadfast embodiment of family values is an inspiration, and I  wish  them years of continued happiness  for  generations to come.  f  RECOGNIZING WOMEN’S EQUALITY  DAY BY PROTECTING WOMEN’S  HEALTH  HON. LAURA RICHARDSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 26, 2011  ",2011
606,4,2011-08-26,Ms. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  recognize August 26 as Women’s  Equality Day, which marks the date in 1920  that women earned the right to vote. Today,  we celebrate women’s equality in the United  States after so many years of being treated as  second-class citizens, denied  the  full  rights  and privileges of male citizens.  Mr. Speaker, voting rights are now an institutionalized right for all women. Any attempt to  weaken or withdraw them would be met with  universal public condemnation. Unfortunately,  there are other historic advances for women  which face an uncertain future. One of these  is Medicare, which 1 in 5 women rely on for  basic health insurance protection.  Since its enactment, Medicare has been a  great equalizer for women’s rights. By removing some of the burdens associated with being  primary caregivers, Medicare freed women to  pursue roles outside the home.  Unfortunately, even  in  retirement, women  are more likely to be dependent on Medicare  than men. It is a critical source of health insurance coverage for nearly all older women in  the United States and  for many  younger  women  who  have  permanent  disabilities.  Nearly half, 49 percent, of women on Medicare have three or more chronic health conditions and 57 percent of women on the program live below the federal poverty level.  Mr. Speaker, Medicare is a social insurance  program  that provides health  insurance coverage to all people who are aged 65 and over  as well as  those who are permanently disabled.  Like women’s suffrage, Medicare endured a  long and difficult battle to be signed into law  since it was first called for by President Truman in 1946. It was introduced in Congress  every session from 1952 to 1964 and was defeated each time. Finally passed as part of the  Great Society  initiative under President Lyndon B. Johnson, Medicare was signed into law  in Independence, Missouri on July 30,1965.  Johnson chose Independence as a tribute to  President Harry  Truman’s  efforts  to  pass  Medicare decades before and enrolled  the  former President as the first Medicare beneficiary. Medicare has four different parts: Hospital Coverage, Medical  Insurance, Medicare  Advantage Plans, and Prescription Drug Plans  which help to cover the cost of inpatient care  in hospitals, doctor’s visits, hospital outpatient  care, preventative services, and  the cost of  prescription drugs.  Since the beginning of the program, Medicare has had a profound impact on the health  and well-being of older women. In 1964, only  51 percent of Americans 65 and older had  health care coverage, nearly 30 percent of  seniors lived below the poverty line and the  average  life expectancy of Americans was  70.2 years old.  Today, virtually all Americans 65 and older  have health care coverage, only 8.9 percent of  seniors live below the poverty line and the average  life expectancy of Americans has  increased to 78.2 years old. Additionally, Medicare provides affordable health care coverage  to over 47 million Americans, including 39 million seniors and 8 million Americans under 65  with disabilities. Among  the oldest Medicare  beneficiaries,  those 85 years and older—70  percent are women.  Mr.  Speaker, Medicare  is  popular  and  strongly supported by the majority of American  women, with 72 percent regarding Medicare  as extremely important to their retirement security.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

607,6,2011-09-02,Mr. COFFMAN of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  rise  today  to  recognize  the Piney  Creek Colorado chapter of the Daughters of  the American Revolution, DAR, for its commitment to preserving American history and fostering patriotism across the country.  The parent society’s history dates back to  1890, a time marked by a revival in patriotism  and an intense interest in the beginnings of  the United States. While  the Piney Creek  chapter was only chartered in 2004, the energy and dedication directed towards the local  community has enhanced  the  lives of many  Coloradans.  The founders of DAR sought to create an  organization which would commemorate  the  patriots of the American Revolution, cultivating  national pride  in  its members and  in  local  communities. The Piney Creek DAR superbly  embodies these tenants, and tirelessly works  to forward the organization’s mission of perpetuating  the memory of  those who contributed  to American  Independence, promoting  educational endeavors as instructed by President George Washington,  and  cherishing  American institutions of freedom.  National events organized by DAR, such as  Constitution Week, celebrate the foundations  of democracy and contribute to the education  of communities. Started in 1955, Constitution  Week seeks to honor and reaffirm the ideals  outlined by our Founding Fathers in 1787. The  Piney Creek chapter of  the DAR has  truly  taken heart in this annual event and has gone  above and beyond to thoughtfully promote the  importance of  the Constitution. From sponsoring and performing education programs  about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights at  local  elementary  schools,  to  disseminating  pocket Constitutions to students and patrons,  the Piney Creek DAR has captured the spirit  of this important week. Moreover, their work  promoting the ideals of the Constitution continues throughout the year by sponsoring high  school Advance Placement U.S. American  History Classrooms and partnering with local  libraries  to  publicly  display  copies  of  our  founding documents.  These efforts and others demonstrate  the  Piney Creek DAR’s exceptional dedication to  country and community. I’m incredibly proud to  have such dedicated volunteers residing in the  6th district of Colorado, and I am certain that  the Piney Creek DAR will continue to serve as  an example of American spirit both past and  future.  RECOGNIZING THE 48TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON  HON. LAURA RICHARDSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 2, 2011  ",2011
608,6,2011-09-02,Ms. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday,  August 28, was  the 48th anniversary of  the  historic March on Washington,  the most  famous act of peaceful protest in our nation’s  history. I rise to pay tribute to the great Americans who conceived, organized, executed and  participated in the March for Jobs and Freedom. That march was a seminal event in our  nation’s history and awakened Americans of  goodwill to the urgent need to rededicate ourselves to the great unfinished task of making  real the promise of America for all Americans,  especially African Americans.  The March on Washington  for Jobs and  Freedom was  a  nonviolent,  political  demonstration  that advocated  for civil rights and  economic  justice  for African Americans. The  march and rally  took place on  the National  Mall in Washington DC on August 28, 1963,  the 100th anniversary of the issuance of President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.  Mr. Speaker, 1963 was a year of racial strife  and unrest, preceded by centuries of legalized  discrimination and  inequality against African  Americans, who faced higher levels of unemployment, lower wages, substandard housing  and inferior educational opportunities.  The march was organized by a coalition of  religious, labor and civil rights organizations,  including  the  ‘‘Big Six’’: Congress of Racial  Equality (CORE), Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Student Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee (SNCC); National Association  for  the Advancement of Colored  People (NAACP); the National Urban League;  and the International Brotherhood of Sleeping  Car Porters.  In May 1963, A. Phillip Randolph, President  of  the  International Brotherhood of Sleeping  Car Porters, wrote to Interior Secretary Stewart Udall requesting a permit for a march culminating at the Lincoln Memorial that fall. As  preparations for the march on the mall went  underway,  the  list of organizations participating in and sponsoring the event expanded  significantly.  On the day of the march, a quarter of a million people from all over the nation gathered  at the Washington Monument and marched together to Lincoln’s Memorial, where the crowd  listened to musical performances, engaged in  prayer and listened to inspirational speeches  encouraging  the crowd  to stand up  for  their  civil rights.  The diversity of those in attendance was reflected in the event’s speakers and performers  including singers such as Bob Dylan and Marian Anderson and actors Harry Belafonte,  Ossie Davis, and Ruby Dee. Attendees  included people of all genders, races, religions,  and nationalities. Among  the  luminaries who  addressed the gathering was John Lewis, who  was then the 23-year-old Chairman of the Student  Non-Violent  Coordinating  Committee  (SNCC) and now one of  the most beloved  members of  the U.S. House of Representatives.  It was at the March on Washington that the  Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered  his famous, ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech which  is universally considered by historians and  scholars as one of the greatest speeches in  American history. Beneath the gaze of President Lincoln, Dr. King challenged the Nation to  make  real  the promise of America  for all  Americans and shared his dream that his ‘‘four  little children will one day  live  in a nation  where they will not be judged by the color of  their skin but by  the content of  their character.’’  The March on Washington was a defining  moment of the rapidly expanding Civil Rights  Movement of the 1960’s and is credited with  galvanizing  the  federal government  to enact  the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The March on Washington demonstrated  the power of non violent direct action to effect  social and political change. An enduring legacy of the March on Washington is that it was  the model and  inspiration  for  future social  movements around  the world,  from Eastern  Europe  to South Africa  to  the Arab Spring  uprisings witnessed earlier this year.  Therefore, I rise with pride and gratitude for  the brave and courageous men and women  who worked to organize the March on Washington. They fought, struggled and risked their  lives in order to ensure a better nation for future generations. The  leaders of  the Civil  Rights Movement and  the March on Washington will be  forever  remembered  for  their  courageous  leadership  and  sacrifices  that  made our country better.  But, the best way to pay tribute to these heroes is to continue the fight for jobs and freedom. With  the national unemployment  rate  above 9 percent—and 15.9 percent for African  Americans—joblessness  in  America  has  reached crisis proportions requiring dramatic  action  to put people back  to work. Making  sure that all Americans can find jobs that pay  enough to raise a family, own a home, educate their children, and care for their parents  is the pressing challenge of our time and is  the unfinished work to which we must rededicate ourselves today.  f  A TRIBUTE TO HOWARD COLLEGE  ON ITS 65TH ANNIVERSARY  HON.

609,6,2011-09-02,Mr. NEUGEBAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor Howard College on its 65th Anniversary. Howard College is a fine institution  of higher education  in West Texas  that has  been  educating  young  people  since September 30, 1946.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

610,4,2011-09-13,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, data  from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  shows that while 14 million Americans  are looking for work, there are only 3  million job openings. This means that  if every single job was filled outright,  there would still be 11 million Americans unemployed and looking for work.  Passing the President’s jobs bill will  help these people and help our overall  economy. According to Mark Zandi,  Moody’s  economist,  the President’s  plan would add 2 percentage points to  the GDP growth next year, add 1.9 million jobs by next year, and cut the unemployment rate by 1 percentage point  next year.  Published  reports  indicate  that  economists across this country are giving the President’s plan a thumb’s up.  This is a clear chance for all of us to  say ‘‘yes’’—yes to growth, yes to a middle class tax cut, and, most  importantly, yes to  jobs and our overall  economy.  PRESIDENT’S SECOND STIMULUS  INCREASES DEBT AND TAXES  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, last Thursday the President  addressed a joint session of Congress in  order to describe his second stimulus.  This proposal would create $447 billion  in new spending, being paid for by tax  increases.  House  Republicans  remain  committed to working together in order to  create job growth and promote an environment that allows  for small businesses to hire workers. Sadly, the administration’s  proposal  pushes  new  taxes on small businesses, which would  create an environment that destroys  jobs. The President was previously correct, saying you do not increase taxes  in a recession. Raising taxes destroys  jobs.  The administration’s  last  stimulus  added $814 billion to our debt. More importantly, it failed to accomplish the  goal of keeping unemployment below  18 percent. Currently, 14 million people  are unemployed and 25 million who  want a full-time job do not have one.  The House Republicans have passed  numerous bills to create jobs. House  Republicans have shown their commitment to jump-starting the ability of  small businesses to create jobs.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September the  11th in the global war on terrorism.  f  JOBS  (Ms. HOCHUL asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2011
611,4,2011-09-13,Ms. HOCHUL.," Mr. Speaker, I come  from a part of this country where my  constituents  are  real  down-to-earth  people, commonsense people.  We want a good education for our  kids, we want Medicare and Social Security for our seniors, and we want the  Buffalo Bills to continue their winning  streak. But more than anything, we  want to get our people back to work—  for our kids who thought a college education was the ticket to a good job, for  our veterans who stepped out of line to  go fight and protect us who now find  themselves in the unemployment line,  and for middle managers who thought  they were set for life until the day the  pink slip showed up on their desk and  turned their lives upside down.  We all know we have to get this  country back to work. We need to pass  the American Jobs Act to do just that.  Just 24 hours ago, Democrats and Republicans stood shoulder to shoulder on  the steps of this Capitol, united in remembrance of 10 years ago, the 10th  anniversary of 9/11. Why can’t we stand  together again and do what’s right for  the American people, Democrats and  Republicans shoulder to shoulder? If we  get the job done here, people out there  will get jobs.  f  JOB CREATION  (Mr. FINCHER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2011
612,4,2011-09-13,Mr. FINCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I come  to the floor this morning to discuss the  need to create jobs, my priority since I  arrived here in January.  Last Thursday,  the President  addressed Congress about his proposal to  create jobs and move this country forward. We must do better.  Recently, I introduced two bills that  are my proposals to help spur job creation:  I  introduced the America’s Energy  Independence Act, which would prevent  the EPA from enforcing its cross-State  pollution rule for 10 years to keep the  flow of electricity high and the cost of  electricity for America’s families low.  The President  recognized  that  the  EPA’s new smog standards would lead  to job losses, but he played politics and  only  rescinded  the  standards  until  right after the election.  I also introduced the Invest in America Act, which would suspend the capital gains tax for 10 years, providing  more certainty  to  families who are  being penalized for selling their homes,  their investments and farms.  Instead of spending money we don’t  have on  initiatives that don’t work,  these  bills  provide  actual  help  to  Americans so they can get back to the  business of making America great.  f  b1210  REGULATING CORPORATE  ELECTION EXPENDITURES  (Ms. EDWARDS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2011
613,4,2011-09-13,Ms. EDWARDS.," Mr. Speaker, John  Paul Stevens warned that the Supreme  Court’s  ruling  in  Citizens  United  threatened to undermine the integrity  of  elected  institutions  around  the  country. How right he was.  Since the Court’s decision last January, corporate special  interests have  had unprecedented freedom to spend on  our elections. In fact, campaign spending by outside groups surged to more  than $300 million in the 2010 election  cycle and are already off the charts for  this cycle. Likewise, State laws that  limited corporate bankrolling of candidates have been struck down.  Mr. Speaker, we have unprecedented  challenges in front of us. But how do  we make  the  tough choices on  the  economy, on taxes, on protecting the  vulnerable and investing in the future  and creating  jobs? We cannot stand  idly by while deeply flawed interpretations of the Constitution are used to  obstruct our democracy rather than  guiding it, putting lobbyists and piles  of cash into policy and elections.

614,12,2011-09-13,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.R. 2887, the Surface and Air Transportation Programs  Extension Act of 2011. In this regard, I  do commend  the Senate and House  leadership for arriving at an agreement  late Friday afternoon on an extension  of our Nation’s surface transportation  programs through March 31, 2012, and  the programs under the FAA through  January 31, 2012, at the current funding  levels and without any adverse policy  riders.  I commend our chairman, Mr. MICA;  the subcommittee chair, Mr. DUNCAN,  on Surface;  the Air Subcommittee  chair, Mr. PETRI; and our ranking subcommittee members, Mr. COSTELLOon  Aviation and Mr. DEFAZIOon Surface.  Extending these programs is critical  to our economic  recovery. And  the  pending measure does so without any  of the poison pills of the past or draconian cuts to investment in our surface  transportation  programs. Failure  to  extend the surface transportation programs  could  shut down more  than  134,000  active  highway  and  bridge  projects and over 5,000 active transit  projects, jeopardizing the jobs of more  than 1 million private-sector American  jobs over the next year.  The  funding  levels  in the pending  measure are far more preferable than  what we are seeing proposed by Republicans  on  the Appropriations Committee. Just last week, they rolled out  a fiscal year 2012 Transportation appropriations bill which proposes to slash  highway and transit  investment, destroying more than 600,000 good paying,  private-sector American jobs, jobs that  would be lost in every State of the  Union.  I cannot support these dangerous and  draconian  cuts  to  investments  in  America’s future. To keep pace with  India, China,  and  our  other  international competitors, we need to invest  more, not less in America’s future. If  we stop investing in the future, there is  simply no way we can retire the debt of  the past.  It is my hope that with this 6-month  extension of highway, highway safety,  and transit programs, we can come together and work to develop a  long-  term,  robust Surface Transportation  authorization bill that keeps the Nation economically competitive, meets  the demands of the 21st century, and  creates millions of family-wage American jobs.  b1240  The pending measure also provides  for a clear extension in the Nation’s  aviation programs under the FAA. Our  aviation system is slightly more than a  month  into  its  recovery  from  the  shock, the shock of a Republican-led  FAA shutdown for 2 weeks in July and  August; and I’m pleased that my Republican  friends have chosen not to  force another shutdown. I trust they  recognize the damage that was caused  to our Nation’s aviation system and  the financial hardship placed on working-class families across the country  when they chose to force a policy rider  into an otherwise clean extension in  July and caused a  senseless  2-week  shutdown of major parts of the FAA.

626,44,2011-09-13,Mr. DURBIN.," There is one other area  I wish to speak to. I know my colleague from New York is going to be on  the floor shortly. The area I wish to  speak to is disaster relief.  I strongly support the disaster relief  funding bill. As Americans undertake  the physically and  emotionally difficult task of rebuilding, cleaning up,  and  recovering  from hurricanes and  flooding  and  even  earthquakes, we  must see that the Disaster Relief Fund  is there so they can get back to their  own lives as quickly as possible.  The year 2011 has been a record year  when it comes to natural disasters. The  cost of recovery from Hurricane Irene  alone could reach $1.5 billion. We have  seen it this year in Illinois. It has been  tough  from Chicago to Cairo  in the  southern portion of our State. We have  had blizzards and floods and tornadoes  and troubles all around. Our State, like  most other States, has seen the damage and has felt it personally. People  are trying to put their homes back together again.  Here is a photo—I saw this in person  when I visited the State earlier this  spring—around Cairo in the southern  part of the State. It was an awful situation. We had flooding along the Ohio  River that troubled and bothered the  folks who live in southern Illinois as  well as Kentucky and adjoining States,  Missouri. Some of our towns, such as  Cairo, were literally threatened with  being inundated. They had to blow levees, which basically means to open up  a place  for the river water to  flow.  That flooded farmland in Missouri and  Illinois, and we have to be sensitive to  the  fact that there were real  losses  there that need to be paid for. That  record  flooding  really  slammed  the  southern part of our State. The devastation was felt in the entire region.  The damage was not  just there. I  hear from people throughout the southern part of the State who are still  struggling today because of this flooding. Anthony Miles in Urbandale, IL, is  an example. Flooding from the Ohio  River rose so high that he could not  even find his lawnmower in the front  yard. All he could see was the river  water.  In Metropolis,  IL, my  friend  Mayor Billy McDaniel said that people  are still trying to get the floodwater  damage repaired in that town months  later. Harrah’s casino  in Metropolis,  which is a major employer and source  of revenue in that area, was completely  inundated with water, and hundreds of  thousands of dollars in repairs need to  be done.  Some argue when it comes to these  disasters that we cannot afford to help  people in America. It appears to me  that the guiding principle and motto of  the tea party in America is this: Just  remember we are all in this alone. That  is what we hear over and over from  them. Whenever we have a problem facing us in America where we come together as a family to solve it, the tea  party stands on the sidelines and says:  Don’t do it. Let them fail.  This morning, Senator REIDquoted a  leading  tea  party  advocate  in  the  House who said: The Federal Emergency Management Agency should be  put out of business.  I wonder where he lives. I wonder if  his home has been spared. I wonder if  he has seen people who through no  fault of their own have lost everything  because of a disaster. When that happens in America, we step in and help  one another. We don’t get tied up in  some political debate. We don’t find  ourselves  completely  stopped  from  stepping  forward and doing what  is  right, and we can’t let it happen this  time either.  Those who say we have to cut other  government programs and education,  medical research, for example, to pay  for the devastation, whether from Hurricane Irene or flooding or earthquakes  or tornadoes, I just don’t think they  understand there are critical areas of  government spending that have been  cut back already, and to cut them even  further would jeopardize the future of  the well-being of  this  country and  many families.  I wanted to show a chart here which  demonstrates the amount requested by  the administration over the years by  different Presidents  for the Disaster  Relief Fund. In each and every one of  these cases, regardless of whether it  was a Democratic or Republican administration, how much of these funds  do you think were offset with funds  from other accounts  in the Federal  budget? None. Zero. In 2000, when more  than $3.5 billion was appropriated for  disaster recovery, how much was offset? None. In 2005 and 2006, when communities all over the South were recovering from Hurricane Katrina and more  than $2 billion was appropriated each  of these 2 years for recovery, how much  of that was offset? None. Under Republican Presidents,  such  as President  Bush, as well as Democratic Presidents, such as Presidents Clinton and  Obama, we have not required offsets in  the rest of the budget when we have  literally  faced a disaster. We have  stepped up, provided the money, and  moved forward.  The number and cost of disasters  have grown dramatically over the past  few years. I do not want to engage the  Senate  in the debate about climate  change because I know people get red  in the face and want to come to the  floor and tell us their political views of  the science of this question. But I will  tell you this: The property and casualty  insurance  industry of America  testified before my committee recently  and said they see what  is coming—  more disasters and more costs than we  ever imagined. One of the experts said  to be prepared to say every summer of  your life from this point forward: This  is the hottest summer I can ever remember. That  is what the  future  is  going to hold.  As  these  temperature  swings  get  worse and worse, they precipitate these  terrible storms. I am not an expert on  much, but I am perhaps a little bit of  an expert after almost 30 years of flying 48 roundtrips a year between Illinois and Washington, flying on commercial airplanes. I think I know a little bit about that, maybe even a little  more than most. This is one of the  roughest periods I can remember. For  the  last several months, the storms  and turbulence have been greater than  I can ever recall. I hope it is an anomaly. I hope it never happens again. We  are told by the experts it is likely to  continue. It means more storms, more  damage, more disasters, and we do not  have the funding here in Washington  waiting to pay for it.

627,52,2011-09-13,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Louisiana.  ,2011
628,52,2011-09-13,Ms. LANDRIEU.," I thank the Senator  from New York for those very descriptive and moving comments about his  State, and particularly the part of his  State that we don’t hear a lot about.  That is why we depend on the Senators  to speak the truth about what is going  on and what they are seeing. I know  the Senator from New Jersey is here to  speak, but pictures are worth a thousand words and I wanted to put this  chart up. I hope the cameras can grasp  the horror of all four of these pictures.  What  is  I think most telling about  them is they are all from a different  State in a different part of the country.  This  picture  is  of Joplin, MO.  I  haven’t myself personally been to Joplin, but before the year is out I will go,  and I think other Senators should go  see what has happened in one of the  great tornado disasters in the history  of our country.  This picture, which almost brings  tears to my eyes because it looks exactly as Lake Pontchartrain looked in  the city of New Orleans, I believe is  from Irene, from North Carolina. It is  heartbreaking. I am sure this is a family who was on the coast, and everything they had is destroyed. It really is  quite moving.  This is a picture on the Mississippi  River, I am not sure in what county.  But when our Senators come to the  floor to talk about rural areas and the  devastation, at least in Missouri, you  can walk down the street and find a  neighbor whose home was equally destroyed and at least get a hug. Out here  in these rural areas, you are by yourself. It could be miles between your  house and your neighbor’s home. You  cannot even find the church where you  worshipped together on Sunday.  Here is Texas. We prayed for the rain  last week to go west to Texas. It hit  Louisiana again. They are the ones  who need it, but they cannot get it.  There were 20,000 fires in Texas. There  were thousands of homes burned up.  Before  everybody  starts  to  think,  what is the great help—yes, FEMA is a  great help. But let me put this in perspective. You get  $2,000 a  family—  $2,000—to  help  buy  a  toothbrush,  maybe a few pieces of clothing, some  initial toiletries, et cetera, and you get  $30,000 for some immediate needs. It is  not as if we are trying to send people $1  million a house. How can people stand  in  the way of  $2,000  for  immediate  needs and $30,000? If you had a house  that was worth $150,000 and you ran a  little printing business and you lost  both, the most you could get out of  this bill is $30,000. Do they think we are  being too generous? It is minimum support. I want to make that clear—minimum support.  Some people are  lucky enough to  have insurance. If the insurance company steps up and does not try to pull  out  the  fine print, as  they did  in  Katrina, and come up with 100,000 excuses why they can’t fund the homes,  maybe they will get homes. This isn’t  us just trying to dump millions of dollars on people who do not deserve it.  That is what I wanted to say. I will  have more to say, but I think these pictures speak 1,000 words. Again, FEMA  is out of money. I don’t want anybody  coming here to vote to say: I didn’t  vote because FEMA has money. They  are out of money. They are stopping  projects all over the country because  all  they  can  basically  do  is  have  enough money to pay those immediate  needs on the east coast. Joplin, MO,  has been told: No, you have to wait.  Louisiana, on the gulf coast, has been  told: No, you have to wait. We are  happy to wait a few weeks. We understand the dilemma. But this cannot go  on week  after week, month  after  month. We have to pass a bill for an entire year and not have to come back to  it.  I see the Senator from New Jersey on  the floor, so I yield the floor.  ",2011

630,52,2011-09-13,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. President, I appreciate the passion of the Senator  from Louisiana and her personal experience  from Louisiana on  the  consequences of disaster. She speaks from  firsthand knowledge and speaks for all  of us in this respect.  I rise today because we as a nation  have always come  together  to help  each other in times of crisis without  question, without politics. In my 20  years between the House and the Senate, I never questioned, in the midst of  a disaster somewhere in the country—  which, fortunately, for the most part  has not been New Jersey—casting my  vote to support those fellow Americans  who found themselves in urgent need  because of natural disasters having  nothing to do with any control they  had whatsoever.  This is not the time to politicize disaster aid. It is not who we are or what  we expect this Nation to be. Our goal  when disaster strikes is to unleash the  full force of the Federal Government to  help families in trouble and communities in ruin, not to score some political points by slowing relief and calling  it responsible fiscal policy. In the wake  of a storm, when the floodwaters rise,  when the winds blow, when the storm  surge rushes in, we should not be rallying our political base; we should be  rallying the full force of emergency responders to help.  In the last few weeks, the east coast  has suffered an earthquake, a hurricane, and some of the worst flooding  my State has seen in years—a 100-year  flood. I received a letter from a constituent  in Moors Landing,  in Monmouth County, who wrote:  Dear Senator MENENDEZ,  I live in Moors Landing, a development of  homes in Howell Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. Our community is in great  need of assistance. One section of our community was devastated by flooding from an  overflow of the Manasquan inlet on August  20 and 21. Homes and property were destroyed, and the families and lives of those  homeowners were terribly disrupted.

634,60,2011-09-13,Mr. THUNE.," Madam President,  I  wish to echo the comments made by  my colleague from Wyoming regarding  regulations. That is something I hear  from small businesses all across South  Dakota, traveling my State during the  month of August. I toured businesses,  and I visited with farmers and ranchers  and small businesspeople. That was a  recurring theme, one thing people continued to bring up unsolicited. When  you asked them questions about what  can be done to help create jobs, to get  them investing and putting their capital  to work,  that was  the  overwhelming response. It came back literally every  single  time,  that businesses are concerned about the overreaching  regulations  coming out of  Washington, DC, and the economic uncertainty that it creates. Part of it just  has to do with the predictability that  businesses need to make long-term investment decisions.  If  they do not  know what is going to happen next in  Washington, DC, it makes it awfully  The  to  hard for them to plan. So as a consequence of that, we see billions of dollars, trillions of dollars, sitting on the  sidelines right now that could be invested and could be put to work, could  be getting people back to work in this  country.  Last week we all listened with great  interest as the President came out to a  joint session of Congress and made a  speech about a jobs plan. He talked  about passing this jobs plan. He has  been  traveling  around  the  country  making that same argument. What was  interesting to me about that proposal—  and, of course, the speech itself was  sufficiently vague. It was very difficult  to know exactly what was in that proposal, where more of those details now  are coming to light. It sounded eerily  similar to the very same proposal we  voted on a couple of years ago in the  Senate. It ultimately became law. It  was called the stimulus bill. It had a  pricetag of nearly $1 trillion.  The assertions made at the time were  along the lines that if we passed this it  would keep unemployment below 8 percent. We know employment is over 9  percent, and since that stimulus bill  was passed we have lost 1.7 million jobs  in our economy. There are 1.7 million  fewer Americans employed today than  there were when  the  stimulus  bill  passed a couple of years ago. So the  question, then, is, Why would we want  to go down that same path?  In many respects this proposal is like  that one because it consists of more  spending and more taxing and more  borrowing—all the things we believe  are detrimental to the economy in the  long run. They do nothing to address  the concern that was raised to me by  the small businesses across South Dakota and the issue to which the Senator from Wyoming was just speaking;  that is, the issue of overregulation that  we keep hearing from our businesses  across this country, the job creators in  our economy.  It strikes me, if the President is serious about actually doing  something  that would create jobs in this country,  it ought to involve putting policies in  place that will be conducive toward  long-term economic growth to provide  the  economic  certainty  these  small  businesses are asking for.  Right now there is uncertainty with  regard to taxes. Tax rates are at least  locked in now until the end of 2012, but  beyond  that  it  is anybody’s guess.  There is a concern, of course, that any  proposal  coming out of Washington  right now that deals with deficit reduction might include higher taxes. That  certainly is something the President  put on the table yet again yesterday as  a proposed way to pay for his new stimulus bill.  There is this repeated and consistent  assault upon small businesses in the  form of more regulations. The President backed off of the ozone regulations, which is something that everybody reacted very favorably toward in  the business community and people I  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:56 Sep 14, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G13SE6.030 S13SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o r e k a l w p         ",2011

ADAMS  HON. JIM COSTA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 13, 2011  ",2011
636,124,2011-09-13,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  congratulate Ms. Linda S. Adams on the occasion of her retirement as the State of California’s Secretary  for Environmental Protection.  More than thirty years of service to California  and its residents make her most deserving of  this honor.  Linda was appointed as Secretary of  the  California Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA)  in  2006,  by  Governor  Arnold  Schwarzenegger. Her appointment was historical, as she was the first woman to ever be  appointed to this position. As California’s EPA  Secretary, Linda had a number of responsibilities which helped ensure the well-being of the  people of California. During her time as secretary, Linda oversaw the activities of the Air  Resources Board, State Water Resources  Control Board, Office of Environmental Health  Hazard Assessment, Department  of  Toxic  Substances Control, Department of Pesticide  Regulation, and approximately 5,000 employees.  Upon her appointment, Linda began to do  innovative work  to address climate change  and global warming. She was selected by  Governor Schwarzenegger as the lead negotiator on Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming  Solutions Act of 2006. She was instrumental in  launching  the Green  Chemistry  Initiative,  which calls for a more comprehensive look at  California’s chemical policies, as well as California’s biomonitoring program which seeks to  find links between environmental contaminants  and human health. She has since continued to  work closely with a number of states and  countries  to  develop  climate  initiatives  to  achieve the greatest global reductions.  Before her service as Secretary of California’s EPA, Linda functioned as the director of  the California Department of Water Resources  and as a member of Governor Gray Davis’  staff. Prior to becoming a member of Governor  Davis’ staff, Linda served Californians for 20  years as a staff member  for  the California  State Legislature. Of note was her  time as  chief consultant to the Senate Committee on  Agriculture and Water Resources. During her  time as a legislative staffer, she worked diligently on assisting the passage of Proposition  204, the Safe, Clean, Reliable Water Supply  Act.  Linda has spent her life working on behalf of  the people of California and has been a longtime friend of California’s Central Valley. She  has worked on several air quality  issues—a  deeply important issue to the Central Valley,  and most recently served as a member of the  Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control  Board.  I applaud Linda for her many years of diligent work on behalf of all of  the people of  California and the Central Valley. I invite my  colleagues to join me in congratulating Linda  on her retirement and thanking her for her innovative approach to enriching the lives of all  Californians.  f  IN MEMORY OF JUDGE FRANK  SCROGGINS  HON. MIKE ROSS  OFARKANSAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 13, 2011  ",2011
637,124,2011-09-13,Mr. ROSS of Arkansas.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor a true, dedicated public servant  who left us much too soon. On Saturday, August 28, 2011, Frank Scroggins, county judge  for Lafayette County, Arkansas, died unexpectedly at the too-young age of 62.  Throughout my  term  in Congress,  I have  had  the distinct pleasure of working with  Judge Scroggins and I have long admired and  respected him. He was a very good friend.  The people of Lafayette County first elected  Judge Scroggins of Stamps, Ark., in 1991 and  he had served as county judge ever since. For  20 years, Judge Scroggins gave his all and  fully embodied what it meant to be a public  servant.  Judge Scroggins was so much a part of his  community  that, upon his passing, a newspaper proclaimed Lafayette County government had ‘‘lost its cornerstone.’’ Indeed, there  is a deep absence in the heart of south Arkansas.  Judge Scroggins always worked  tirelessly  on behalf of the people of Lafayette County,  never losing sight of what he was elected to  do. From city council to the quorum court to  the U.S. Congress, anyone who had the privilege of working with Judge Scroggins can attest  to  the sincerity, honesty and  ferocity  in  which he served as county judge.  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife of  42 years, Brenda, and the rest of his family  and friends during this very difficult time.  Today,  I ask all Members of Congress  to  join me as we honor  the  life and  legacy of  Judge Frank Scroggins, who will be deeply  missed  in Lafayette County and  throughout  the state of Arkansas.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

639,132,2011-09-13,Mr. KEATING.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the seventy-fifth anniversary of the  Cape Cod Times, a daily newspaper circulated  throughout the towns and villages of Massachusetts’ Cape and Islands.  Seventy-five years ago, businessmen J.P.  Dunn and Basil Brewer came  together  in a  Hyannis garage  to publish  the Cape Cod  Standard-Times. This union grew out of  the  men’s desire to provide the residents of the  Cape and Islands with access to community  news, so they teamed up with the New Bedford  Standard-Times  for  joint  distribution  through  the 1960s. By 1970, however,  the  success of local small businesses and industries had brought an era of expansion to the  region, augmenting the need for a local paper  to service  the needs and  interests of  the  unique communities of the Cape and Islands.  In 1975, the first Cape Cod Times edition was  published  as  an  ‘‘independent Cape Cod  newspaper,  printed  and  published  on  the  Cape, by Cape Codders, for Cape Codders.’’  Today, the Cape Cod Times provides over  60,000 readers in the region with daily headlines of national and  local  relevance—from  summer beach  closings  to breaking news  across  the  globe. The  paper’s  circulation  reaches beyond the Cape and Islands through  its online subscription, allowing readers to stay  up-to-date on community happenings no matter their location.  Time and time again, the paper has been  recognized for its national significance, having  been named  to such prestigious awards as  ‘‘Newspaper of  the Year,’’  ‘‘Website of  the  Year’’ and ‘‘Sunday Newspaper of the Year’’  by  the New England Press Association,  the  New England Newspaper Association, and the  New England Associated Press Executives  Association.  Having owned a home on Cape Cod  for  twenty years, it is with pride and gratitude that  I congratulate the Cape Cod Times, its editors  and staff on providing seventy-five years of  authentic journalism to the people of the Tenth  Congressional District of Massachusetts. I extend my best wishes to the paper for many  more years of award-winning  journalism  to  come.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

641,132,2011-09-13,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor the Chester Library located in  Morris County, New Jersey, as it celebrates its  100th anniversary this year.  The Chester Library officially opened on  Labor Day  in 1911 as a  joint  library of  the  Chesters. The  library originally occupied a  very small space above a metal shoe-support  factory and was only open for selected hours  on Saturdays. Due to difficulty attaining funding, it constantly moved from one location to  another until  it  finally settled  in  its current  home in 1981.  The library expanded in 2004 with the addition of a Children’s Room and a public meeting room. The new room not only provided  extra meeting space for the library, but it is  also available for local non-profits to use.  With a collection of over 70,000 books,  music CDs,  audio  books, movies,  video  games, e-books and periodicals, the Chester  Library has come a long way from its modest  start with merely 138 books. Available for borrowing are books, magazines, audio books,  DVDs, video tapes, CDs, video games, puppets and puzzles. Residents of Chester Borough and Chester Township, as well as any  person with a Morris Automated  Information  Network (M.A.I.N.) card, are free to search the  shelves and take advantage of all the library  has to offer.  With more than 300 programs for visitors,  there is something for everyone. From story  time for children to book discussions with the  Young Adult Club and Computer Education for  seniors, the Chester Library is a rich resource  for the community. The library has 12 public  computers with free Internet that provide visitors with convenient access to the Internet and  other databases.  The Chester Library serves a vital role  in  the community. Not only does it provide access to numerous books, collections and databases, but the library also offers the people of  Chester with a social community where everyone is welcome to share and enjoy.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues  to  join me  in congratulating  the Chester Library as  they celebrate 100 years of supporting access to knowledge and information  in the local community.  f  OUR UNCONSCIONABLE NATIONAL  DEBT  HON.

The Award  is  given by the Sacred Heart School Community  in Atherton, California, to individuals who have  made sustained and significant contributions  to the schools and embody the goals and criteria of a Sacred Heart education. John Hunter’s commitment  to  the mission of Sacred  Heart education spans decades, is an inspiration to everyone, and has earned him the coveted St. Madeleine Sophie Award.  John N. Hunter is a 1951 graduate of Stanford University and served his country as a  member of the United States Army. He is a  successful entrepreneur and has made significant contributions  in  the  fields of education  and community development.  John N. Hunter  joined  the Sacred Heart  Schools Board of Trustees in 1978. This was  a  time of  transition  for  the schools. John  helped craft the first strategic plan and was a  leader of the schools’ first capital campaign.  He has served on the board of the Religious  of  the Sacred Heart’s Oakwood Retirement  Community, and played a key role in expanding the facility and building a chapel.  John has been married to the former Josephine Kegley since 1959, and  they are  the  proud parents of five children: Julene, Wendi,  Elizabeth, John and Mary, all of whom attended Sacred Heart Schools in Atherton.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  in congratulating John N. Hunter as he  receives the St. Madeleine Sophie Award and  salute him for his tireless work, his humility,  his wonderful sense of humor, and his lasting  commitment to the extraordinary education of  the Religious of  the Sacred Heart and  their  schools in Atherton, California, where generations of children have been shaped, strengthening our community and our country.

652,12,2011-09-23,Mr. WHITFIELD.," I have great admiration for the gentleman from Florida,  who is always eloquent in his remarks.  b1030  He  started off his  support of his  amendment by saying that we are trying  to dismantle any  regulation.  I  would like to remind everyone, once  again, that this bill applies to 14 EPA  regulations and we do not delay in any  way 12 of them. And on the other two,  we delay one of them, both of them, 6  months after the final report is due.  Now, he had mentioned that Exelon  supported the new EPA regulations.  Exelon is a company that we all admire  and respect, but it’s a nuclear energy  company, so there’s nothing in these  regulations that has any  impact on  them, as far as I know. But all of these  regulations are trying to drive the coal  industry out of business, that still provides 50 percent of all the electricity in  America.  Now, in the TRAIN Act, we simply  ask this independent government agency, composed of Obama administration  appointees, to examine the cumulative  impact of all of these rules, because  EPA has never been quite this aggressive. And I might add that the two  rules that we asked to delay for further  analysis,  an  independent  research  group said that the annualized cost  would be almost $18 billion that utiliI  ties would have to spend to buy equipment that may not be able to even  then achieve the standards because the  technology is not available.  The issue is not about mercury. The  utilities do a great job of cleaning up  mercury. EPA itself said that its Utility MACT would only benefit—the benefit of the Utility MACT would be only  .004 percent attributable to mercury  because 99 percent of mercury in America comes from nature and from outside other countries  that  the  trade  winds bring in to our country. So utilities don’t object to the mercury part of  this.  But they’re now adding hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride, of which  there  is no  technology available  to  achieve the standard that EPA is setting.  So because of the cost, because of the  unique vulnerability of our economy  today, 12 of these regulations we don’t  delay at all. We just say, let’s study  the  cumulative  impact, which  the  President asked for in his Executive  order that he issued recently. He said  we need to look at the cumulative impact. That’s what we’re trying to do.  This amendment would basically say,  you don’t look at the cumulative impact, you just take the existing studies  that have been made. I would also say  that EPA didn’t even do any study on  the greenhouse gas, which we’re only  trying to analyze the full cost of that.  For those reasons, I would respectfully oppose the gentleman’s amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

660,12,2011-09-23,Mr. CONNOLLY  of Virginia.," Mr.  Chairman, Deutsche Bank, the biggest  bank in Europe, recently issued a report on global clean energy investment  opportunities  in  which  it  stated,  ‘‘Countries with more TLC,  transparency, longevity, and certainty, in  their climate policy frameworks will  attract more investment and build new  clean industries, technologies, and jobs  faster than their policy-lagging counterparts.’’  The TRAIN Act is one more step in  the wrong direction by the same Republican House which has held over 110  anti-environmental votes. This unprecedented assault on  the environment  has devastating consequences for our  economy. As the Deutsche Bank report  said,  ‘‘Germany  and  China  have  emerged as global leaders in low carbon technologies and investment. The  net effect is that while Congress stumbles, the U.S. stands to fall behind.’’  This investor report, from Europe’s  largest bank, identified several policy  failures that are impeding job growth  here at home. First, Congress has not  established a carbon reduction target,  or required polluters to pay  for the  cost of greenhouse gas pollution. Congress does not have a national renewable standard or even an energy efficient standard. The Deutsche Bank report notes that the lack of these regulations  and  incentives has  actually  forced investors to make investments  elsewhere, including in China and other  countries, rather than here at home in  America. As a result, we have  lost  solar and other advanced technology  market share to our competitors.  My simple amendment to the TRAIN  Act establishes a  simple process  to  identify ‘‘policies that should be adopted and  implemented by  the United  States to provide domestic job growth,  and to ensure that our Nation is internationally competitive in the $5 trillion global energy industry for clean  energy technology, development, and  manufacturing.’’ Business leaders have  urged Congress to adopt both a regulatory framework and a system of incentives to spur clean energy job creation. In addition to the regulation the  Deutsche Bank identified as supporting  investment, American  entrepreneurs  have called on Congress to expand public financing for clean energy.  This month members of the American Energy Innovation Council visited  Capitol Hill to express their strong  support  for  just  that concept. This  group included venture capitalist John  Doerr,  former Lockheed Martin CEO  Norm Augustine, and Bill Gates of  Microsoft. The American Energy Innovation Council recently issued a report  which stated, ‘‘As business leaders, we  feel that America’s current energy system is deficient in ways that cause serious harm to our economy, our national security, and our environment.

661,20,2011-09-23,Mr. TERRY.," I believe that the gentlelady from California’s amendment is  heartfelt and sincere to the DERA program but irresponsible as it’s produced  here today. There are costs associated  with the EPA going forward with the  studies that we are requesting of them.  Under our rules of the House, there’s  PAYGO rules. We must offset those  costs. This is one of those tough decisions made to offset the costs. So the  first line of irresponsibility would be it  will add to the deficit but for this offset.  b1120  The second  line of  irresponsibility  would be, well, it may feel responsible.  And this really is a poison pill because  if the offset is eliminated, they get to  kill the whole bill because of that. So  it’s not as innocent an amendment as  it is portrayed on the surface. The real  issue of  this bill  in  entirety must  stand.  As previous speakers have said, Mr.  Chairman, and rightfully so, the EPA  is a rogue agency. They are producing  rules in a fast and furious manner that  greatly affects this Nation’s ability to  generate  electricity. This  bill  just  wraps three of them together and says,  take a step back and do a cost analysis,  as the President has asked of agencies.  This agency, though, as headed by Ms.  Jackson, has said to us in our committee that she will not be beholding  or follow the President’s own executive  order to look at the cost benefit analysis. They say, as we have heard here  today, their modeling says that they  can reduce asthma so, therefore, no  cost benefit analysis.  But there are real effects that I’m  concerned with here, and the reason  why I do believe this needs to be studied before implemented is we need to  slow down the EPA and Lisa Jackson  and their attempts to do a cap program  without Congress’ involvement or approval. They couldn’t get it done legislatively, so she’s doing it by rule and  edict from the EPA.  This rule will add significant costs to  the ability of small generators to generate electricity, which will force them  to shut down without any path forward  to replace that. In fact, they haven’t  even done a study on reliability to determine if electricity can be wheeled  into the areas that the plants will have  to shut down.  In fact, there are two plants near my  district in Nebraska: Grand Island and  Fremont. Grand Island is saying that  these rules of the EPA are fast and furious and without any cost benefit  analysis will  force the Grand Island  plant to close. How will they get their  electricity? They will have to find a  creative way to do it; yet there’s been  no study on reliability. Secondly, in  Fremont, Nebraska,  they  say what  they’ll do  is  just  lower their plant  level, just do a minimum amount of  electricity. Where are they going to  make that up?  This is a directive. This is part of the  radical environmentalist agenda being  placed on America by one agency and  one person, Lisa Jackson. We need to  slow this down and take a hard look at  it.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011
662,20,2011-09-23,Ms. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Chairman, I  find it interesting that the gentleman  would say that this might be irresponsible. What I heard of the comments  was I didn’t talk about the legislation  within itself. We’re talking about the  amendment of how this is going to be  paid for. And so the question before the  House is going to be, is it appropriate  to take additional funds to use DERA  as the whipping boy time and time  again  for a program that  is helping  what my colleague from the other side  is saying?  I would actually say that DERA is responsible. What’s irresponsible is continuing to put the health of Americans  in jeopardy. I will repeat the quote for  my colleagues from the chairman of  the Interior, Environment and Related  Agencies, ",2011
663,20,2011-09-23,Mr. SIMPSON.," He called the  cuts to DERA ‘‘the wrong choice.’’ We  have  already  been  responsible,  and  DERA has already paid its fair share,  and it’s being cut as other programs  have been cut. The question is, is it  right to continue to deplete this program?  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011
664,20,2011-09-23,Mr. TERRY.," Mr. Chairman, I think  it’s interesting that she didn’t refute  the point that if the PAYGO is eliminated, hers passes, they raise a point of  order and kill the bill, which is the real  impetus behind this amendment.  ",2011
665,20,2011-09-23,Ms. RICHARDSON., Will  the  tleman yield?  ,2011
666,20,2011-09-23,Mr. TERRY.," No.  I  think  it’s  also  interesting—you  have the right to close—that the President’s budget, for which there was no  pushback by  this other  side of  the  aisle, zeroed it out. Ours didn’t. We’re  just cutting it by $4 million, and it’s a  tough choice. We agree.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011
667,20,2011-09-23,Ms. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Chairman, in  closing, I would say, I think I’ve said  twice now, the issue that we have before us is the question of this amendment whether DERA is the appropriate  funding source that would be considered for the offset. That’s the question  that we have before us.  It’s interesting that Mr. WHITFIELD  himself has benefited  from this program. In Kentucky, the construction  ports utilized $1.16 million to retrofit  73  pieces  of  nonroad  construction  equipment. Also, the Kentucky Association General Contractors benefited  from retrofitting 87 pieces of equipment. I would say to you it’s irresponsible to have the American public driving on our highways and roads and  going through our airports breathing  this air.  What I’ve reached out to the other  side is that it’s important. We’re talking about EPA regulations. Why would  we reduce funding of a program that  helps companies to meet the regulations?  It’s  counterintuitive  and  it  doesn’t make sense.  genI urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’  for  the Richardson amendment; and  the Richardson amendment is intended  for exactly that, to eliminate cutting  this program.

For anyone who  is confused about  what is going on in Congress right now,  let me make it easy. In order to keep  the government running beyond next  week, Congress needs to pass a short-  term bill that funds government operations at a spending  level to which  both parties can agree. The good news  is, we have already agreed on a spending level. That has already been done.  Last night, the House of Representatives passed a bill that meets that figure we agreed on a couple of months  ago.  Here is the holdup.

718,52,2011-09-23,Mr. MANCHIN.," Mr. President, first of  all, I say to my good friend from Florida, I thank him so much for the compassion he has. I appreciate very much  him bringing this issue to our light and  to the attention of all of us, and maybe  we can help. I thank the Senator.  To my good friend, the Senator from  Louisiana,  I think what she speaks  about is us identifying who we are as  Americans and the way we have taken  care of each other. I do not know of  any State that has not had to depend  on FEMA for help—and not just the  States she showed where  ‘‘hurricane  alley’’ is and where the tornadoes and  hurricanes have hit, but basically all of  us have had to depend on FEMA for assistance. So I think what she brings to  light is the fairness we identify with as  Americans and to do what we have always done: to take care of each other.  I, for one, have said we need to rebuild  America; we need to take care of Americans first.  f  FISCAL CHOICES  ",2011
719,52,2011-09-23,Mr. MANCHIN.," Mr. President, I rise  today to speak about the difficult fiscal choices we, as Members of Congress, must soon make and the deficit-  cutting  proposals  that  President  Obama has recently made.  As we discuss these  fiscal choices,  and as we face our exploding debts and  deficits, it is clear our Nation is truly  at a crossroads. A nation that was built  on the strength of our people’s optimism must struggle to overcome a loss  of confidence—a loss of confidence that  comes from an economy that has struggled for far too long, a loss of confidence that comes from watching debt  and deficits explode, a  loss of confidence that comes from watching Republicans and Democrats engage in a  fruitless partisan fight.  The American people worry about  how to get their families out of debt  and  their  financial house  in order.  They worry about finding or keeping a  job. They worry about how they are  going to pay the rent, how they are  going to take care of their children,  how they are going to keep clothes on  their backs, and how, maybe, they can  buy them a Christmas present.  Once again, instead of all of us coming together to do what is right for the  Nation and lighten their worries, congressional Republicans and Democrats  alike, and  the President, are again  gearing up for a fight about politics,  even as our Nation’s fiscal and economic picture gets worse every minute.  Today, we yet again find ourselves on  the brink, and I cannot begin to explain why to the American people. This  summer, they watched us go through  this exercise—the Senate, the House,  and the President—and then we agreed  on spending cuts to keep the government working. Where I come from—the  same as the Presiding Officer from the  great State of Minnesota—your word is  your bond, and an agreement  is an  agreement, and it is one that should be  kept. It is one we negotiated. It should  not be changed  in midstream. I am  committed to passing a clean CR to  keep our government working until the  supercommittee we all are supporting  comes up with the recommendations to  reduce the deficit.  In the midst of yet another disagreement over whether to keep the government running, the people of West Virginia and the American people are demanding we  put  our  partisan  differences aside and work together in the  best interests of this country. They are  pleading  for us to quit  fighting and  worrying about the next election and  start worrying about the next generation.  With our Nation facing a death spiral  of debt, now is the time that each of us  should be zeroing in on credible, commonsense solutions that have truly bipartisan support.  After carefully reviewing the President’s  recommendations  to  the  so-  called supercommittee, I believe they  fall short of what this country needs to  put our fiscal house in order. President  Obama’s deficit recommendations not  only fall short of his stated $4.4 trillion  goal, but could, according to an analysis done by the Center for Responsible  Federal Budget, have the perverse effect of adding as much as $1.9 trillion  to our Nation’s debt.  I am also greatly concerned about rehashing  unproductive  recommendations such as raising tax rates on small  businesses in a recession and budget  gimmicks such as the notion that taxpayers will somehow ‘‘save’’ $1.1 trillion from not fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq—and I believe we should  not be there anyway.  I have said this: On my best day, I  cannot sell that to the people of West  Virginia, nor should we try to sell it to  the American people.  That is not to say that the President’s proposal  is all bad. There  is  some good stuff in there. I have long  said our tax system needs to be more  fair and balanced and that billionaires  such as Mr. Buffett should pay their  fair share. I appreciate the concept of  the Buffett rule and look forward to  seeing more details. And I agree that  one of the best  investments we all  could make is in the infrastructure of  this great country.  But as they stand right now, President Obama’s proposals are too skewed  to appeal to both sides of the aisle. So  we see what we see happening again. If  we are being serious about addressing  our debt and deficits, neither Republicans nor Democrats can propose partisan proposals and then pretend they  are credible. We cannot do that any  longer. The American people deserve  better, and I also know we can do a lot  better.  In my short time in Congress, I have  seen only one plan that has earned support from Members of both parties. In  fact,  the President’s own bipartisan  deficit commission—the Bowles-Simpson group—is the best example of what  can be accomplished if we put politics  aside and do what is right for our Nation. While no one, including me, will  agree with everything in the Bowles-  Simpson approach, it at least offered a  commonsense,  bipartisan  template  that would cut spending, restore tax  fairness, and would help restore fiscal  sanity to our Nation.  To date, it is the only plan that has  offered a framework that has had bipartisan support from the beginning,  and still has it now. But instead of this  approach, there are many people on  both sides of the aisle who have chosen  a path that all but guarantees that Republicans and Democrats will continue  to fight over how to solve our fiscal  problems, instead of seeking common  ground  and  commonsense  solutions.  For the sake of our Nation, for our  families, we cannot let this happen. We  must act, and we must act together.  Looking ahead to the vigorous debates of the fall, my hope is the deficit  supercommittee will seize the moment  and seek common ground to develop a  plan that puts our Nation on the right  path to fiscal accountability. Common  sense, to me, is that you would start  with a plan that already has bipartisan  support because it will take both sides  of the aisle to fix this problem.  I urge them and the President to  look beyond partisan politics and do  what is right for this country. I continue to urge the committee to look  past their legal mandate of $1.5 trillion  in savings and revenue and, instead,  look for reforms that will create much  broader  fairness  in our system that  will  lead to deficit reductions of at  least $4 trillion.  I, for one, will work with the Senate  Democrats and Republicans who are  committed to develop a commonsense  debt fix that responsibly reduces spending; makes our tax system more fair,  cuts waste,  fraud,  and  abuse,  and  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:36 Jun 03, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\SEPT\S23SE1.REC S23SE1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011
720,60,2011-09-23,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, 10 years  ago, I introduced the DREAM Act, legislation  that would  allow  a  select  group  of  immigrant  students with  great  potential  to  contribute more  fully to America.  The DREAM Act would give these  students a chance to earn legal status  if they came to the U.S. as children,  are long-term U.S. residents, have good  moral character, graduate from high  school, and complete 2 years of college  or military service in good standing.  The DREAM Act would make America a stronger country by giving these  talented immigrants the chance serve  in our military and contribute to our  economy.  Tens of thousands of highly-qualified,  well-educated young people would enlist in the Armed Forces if the DREAM  Act becomes law.  And studies have found that DREAM  Act participants would contribute literally trillions of dollars to the U.S.  economy during their working lives.  These young people have overcome  great obstacles to succeed. They are  valedictorians, star athletes, honor-roll  students, and ROTC leaders. Now they  want to give back to their country.  The DREAM Act would give them that  chance.  For the  last 10 years I have been  working on the DREAM Act, there has  been one constant: strong support from  the faith community. The DREAM Act  is supported by almost every religious  group you can imagine: Catholic, Methodist, Episcopal, Lutheran, and Evangelical Christians; Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Jews; and Muslims,  Hindus, and Sikhs.  The  faith community supports the  DREAM Act because it is based on a  fundamental moral principle that  is  shared by every religious tradition—it  is wrong to punish children for the actions of their parents.  These students were brought to this  country as children. They grew up here  pledging allegiance to the American  flag and singing the only national anthem they’ve ever known. They are  American  in  their hearts and  they  should not be punished for their parents’ decision to bring them here.  For the next several weeks, people of  faith all across this country will show  their support for the DREAM Act by  celebrating  the  first-ever  ‘‘DREAM  Sabbath.’’  On the DREAM Sabbath, at churches,  synagogues, mosques,  and  temples  around  the  country, Americans  of  many religious backgrounds will offer  prayers  for  the  immigrant  students  who would be eligible for the DREAM  Act. At many of these events, these  DREAM Act students will tell their  stories.  The DREAM Sabbath will take place  over several weekends  in September  and October, and so far, there are more  than  320  DREAM  Sabbath  events  planned, in 44 States.  In  June, when  I  announced  the  DREAM Sabbath, I was joined by religious leaders from a great variety of  faith  traditions,  including: Cardinal  Theodore McCarrick, a good friend who  has been a leader in the fight for immigration reform for many years; Bishop  Minerva Carcan˜o,  the  first Hispanic  woman  to be elected bishop  in  the  Methodist Church; Reverend Samuel  Rodriguez, the president of the Nation’s largest Hispanic Christian organization, with more than 30,000 member  churches; Reverend Derrick Harkins,  the pastor of one of the most prominent African-American churches in our  Nation’s Capitol, who was representing  the  National  Association  of  Evangelicals; Bishop Richard Graham  of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in  America; Bishop David Jones of the  Episcopal  Church;  Rabbi  Lisa  VerDate Mar 15 2010  01:36 Jun 03, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\SEPT\S23SE1.REC S23SE1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

The  Good Samaritan Society operates a number of  nursing homes around the country. Denton Village’s inception in 1976 marked the beginning  of their exceptional service offerings in long-  term care and senior  living complexes. The  Denton Village has since expanded their services  to  include  twin homes, assisted  living,  and a second senior living apartment building.  My parents lived in a duplex at Denton Village. The facilities and staff at Denton Village  allowed my parents, Harry and Norma,  to  enjoy a more fulfilling and carefree life. When  it comes to providing individualized care the  people at Denton Village go above and beyond for their residents. Denton Village is a  place that cares for people, and is one of the  best nursing homes in Dallas Fort-Worth Area.  This anniversary is a wonderful opportunity  for us to celebrate and recognize the values of  the Good Samaritan Society and the delivery  of those values at the Denton Village. I am  truly proud to recognize everybody at Denton  Village for their 35th Anniversary of excellent  service, and I know the Denton community appreciates their years of service.

With a growing population of more  than  50,000, the Ukrainian community has been a  staple in the Greater Cleveland area for decades. In October, 2008, the City of Parma City  Council became the first local government in  Northeast Ohio to sponsor an ethnic neighborhood; Ukrainian Village. Ukrainian Village covers two miles along State Road and is home  to Ukrainian butcher shops, credit unions, two  Ukrainian Orthodox churches and now Ukrainian Village Park. The mission of Ukrainian Village is, ‘‘To preserve, empower, and advance  Ukrainian Village as a  thriving neighborhood  by celebrating  the culture and heritage of  Ukrainian Americans and  to collaborate with  the City of Parma  in creating business and  economic development within its boundaries.’’  The Ukrainian Village Parade and Ukrainian  Village Park dedication will be hosted by the  City of Parma, Ukrainian Village Committee  and  the United Ukrainian Organizations of  Ohio. The United Ukrainian Organizations of  Ohio has represented more than 50 Ohio organizations since 1928. This year’s Ukrainian  Village celebration will commemorate the 20th  anniversary of Ukraine’s  independence,  include an annual parade and festival and feature the opening and dedication of the Ukrainian Village Park.  This year’s parade will include, for the first  time, all five of Parma’s high school’s bands;  Parma Senior High School, Normandy High  School, Valley Forge High School, Padua  Franciscan High School and Holy Name High  School. Additionally,  the parade will  feature  church groups, civic organizations, representatives  from  the Polish, Hungarian, German,  Irish and Slovak communities, Ukrainian Village businesses, numerous Ukrainian-American organizations, singers, dancers, school  children,  and  His  Eminence  Archbishop  Antony.

723,84,2011-09-23,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Chair, today’s debate is  de´ja´ vu from the debate within the House Energy and Commerce committee. Once again  my colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce Committee had the opportunity to address and protect human health and environment, while also promote and encourage innovation and  job creation. These are serious  issues facing our country and the EPA, issues  that require serious solutions. Sadly, this bill  does nothing to actually address those issues.  In addition to the lack of a well thought-out  strategy, the proposed amendments to this bill  would make serious changes to the Clean Air  Act without any congressional hearing or testimony. None of these proposals have had serious examination by  the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over  this matter. This  is not  the open and  transparent legislative process that my colleagues  have committed  to. We cannot  responsibly  govern in this matter and ignore our Constitutional obligation to hold hearings, hear testimony, and give  these matters  the  in-depth  consideration major policy initiatives deserve.  As I said, there are legitimate problems with  some of  the proposed  rules coming out of  EPA, and they need to be dealt with. However, this Polish lawyer from Detroit happens  to believe we would get further with a more  surgical approach to dealing with these matters.  I am particularly concerned with the Utility  MACT, which in its current form, could have a  devastating effect on  the economy of Midwestern manufacturing States,  including my  home State of Michigan. I am convinced that  a balanced, bipartisan solution  to  this  issue  was available to us. In fact, I offered to work  with all of my colleagues, both Democrats and  Republicans on  this matter. Sadly, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would  rather play political games rather than work on  a reasonable solution to a legitimate problem.  I would note to my colleagues that we spent  only one day on the failed Continuing Resolution, but will spend two days on this bill. This,  I believe, demonstrates  the  true  intention of  the GOP. That is not to actually deal with a legitimate and disconcerting problem, but  to  spend  time on  their  favorite whipping boy,  EPA. Now, I have had my share of issues with  that particular agency, but  I have always  sought a solution—not played games to gain  political points.  As such, it is my intent to vote against the  TRAIN Act and the amendments proposed by  the other side of the aisle. The President already indicated his strong opposition and as  such, the bill before us is nothing more than  veto bait.  I would call on my colleagues on  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:00 Sep 24, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K23SE8.004 E23SEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011
724,92,2011-09-23,Mr. KUCINICH.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of the Czech Catholics of Greater  Cleveland’s 88th Annual Feast of St. Wenceslaus on September 24, 2011 at Our Lady of  Lourdes Parish. This year’s celebration will  also honor the 100th anniversary of the founding of Cleveland’s former Holy Family Parish.  St. Wenceslaus  is  the patron saint of  the  Czech Republic. Every year, his  feast day,  September 28th, is celebrated by Czech communities around  the world. St. Wenceslaus  was  the  leader of Old Bohemia during  the  early part of the 10th Century. During his tenure as king, St. Wenceslaus  took a vow of  chastity and was devoted to his Christian faith.  Killed by his brother, St. Wenceslaus was later  canonized as a martyr of the Christian faith.  In addition  to celebrating  the Feast of St.  Wenceslaus,  the 100th anniversary of  the  founding of the former Holy Family Parish will  be recognized at this year’s celebration. Holy  Family was  founded on November 6, 1911  after Father Rudolph Habrda noticed Bohemian families moving into Cleveland’s Woodland Hills neighborhood. Over  the years, as  parishioners began  to move  to  the suburbs,  the parish school merged with St. Cecilia,  Epiphany and St. Mary of Czestochowa  to  form Mr. Pleasant Elementary School.  In  1988, the Holy Family Parish was closed.  Our Lady of Lourdes Parish is one of only  two Czech congregations left in the Cleveland  Catholic  Diocese,  along  with  St.  John  Nepomucene  in Slavic Village. The Czech  Catholics of Greater Cleveland will gather together on September 24th  for mass and a  celebration featuring the Hronek Czech Band.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me  in recognition of the 88th Annual Feast of St.  Wenceslaus.  I offer my best wishes  to  the  Czech Catholics of Greater Cleveland and all  those who attend this joyous celebration.  f  TAIWAN CENTENNIAL NATIONAL  DAY  HON. THOMAS E.

The  recently  released  2010 World Competitive Yearbook finds Taiwan to have the 8th most competitive economy among the 58 countries surveyed.  Over the past year, the number of employed  people has increased and the unemployment  rate has dropped to an enviable 5.17 percent.  Even more  important  than  its economic  achievements, Taiwan has developed  into a  strong and vibrant democracy. It is a valued  member of the free nations of the world, even  though  it  is burdened with particular and  unique  diplomatic  challenges—challenges  which the Taiwanese people and government  have met with courage.  On the occasion of the Republic of China’s  Centennial National Day, I hope there can be  renewed peaceful coexistence and co-prosperity between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. There have been many agreements  reached between the two sides, including direct air and sea links, increased mutual investments, and  regular negotiations over economic and other substantial issues.  Also, I offer my congratulations to Taiwan  for  its continued participation  in  the World  Health Assembly meetings last May in Geneva  and  to  its continuing commitment  to safeguarding human rights and other universal values.  Congratulations to the Republic of China. I  look  forward  to closer relations between  the  United States and Taiwan.  f  THE COME-FROM-BEHIND  GRASSHOPPERS WIN IT ALL  HON. HOWARD COBLE  OFNORTHCAROLINA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 23, 2011  ",2011
726,92,2011-09-23,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, as Major League  Baseball begins its post-season push, the professional minor  leagues are concluding  their  seasons. The citizens of the Sixth District of  North Carolina are celebrating the first championship since 1982 of the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the South Atlantic League.  The Hoppers—as  their  fans affectionately  call them—were a dramatic, come-from-behind  team all season. It took the final games of the  season  for  the Hoppers  to even qualify  for  post-season play. Greensboro split  the  first  two games at home in the best-of-five championship series against  the Savannah Sand  Gnats. When the series moved to Savannah,  the Hoppers  lost game  three  to  the Sand  Gnats.  It has been 11 years  in  the  ‘‘Sally  League’’ since a team leading two-games-to-  one  failed  to clinch  the championship. With  Savannah needing only one more win to capture the South Atlantic League title, the Hoppers were  facing  the end of  their season,  when they pulled out a heart-stopping, 11-inning win to force a fifth and deciding game.  Even  in  the championship game, Greensboro fell behind 2–0 early before cruising to 7–  3 win to capture its first South Atlantic League  championship in almost three decades. Hoppers Manager Andy Haines told the Greensboro News & Record that he could not pick a  Most Valuable Player for the series. ‘‘There’s  no way I could name anyone,’’ Haines told the  newspaper. ‘‘We had a lot of guys contribute.  It was someone different every night.’’  All of the Grasshoppers can be proud of the  regular season, along with the dramatic run to  the  title. Among  those who were part of  Greensboro’s  first championship since 1982  included:  pitchers  Michael  Brady,  Alex  Caldera, Jordan Conley, Grant Dayton, James  Leverton, Miguel Mejia, Robert Morey, Gregory Nappo, Mike Ojala, Chris Shafer, Rett  Varner, Kyle Winters, and Brett Zawacki. The  catchers  were  Aaron  Dudley,  Wilfredo  Gimenez, and Jacob Realmuto. The infielders  included Daniel Black, Joe Bonadonna, Mark  Canha, Ryan Fisher, and Noah Perio. The  outfielders  were  lssac  Galloway, Marcell  Ozuna, James Wooster, and Christian Yelich.  Only one of those on the disabled list, Zachary  Neal, made it onto the post-season roster, but  the others contributed during  the year and  they included Kevin Cravey, Alan Oaks, Jay  Rogers, Adam Veres, and Sean Watson.  Greensboro  is one of  the best-run minor  league teams in the entire United States and  it  is because of an outstanding  front office.  This  championship  caliber  group  includes:  Donald Moore, President/General Manager;  Katie Dannemiller, Vice President, Baseball  Operations; Jimmy Kesler, CFO; Tim Vangel,  Assistant General Manager, Sales and Marketing; Jake Holloway, Assistant General Manager, Head Groundskeeper; Erich Dietz, Director of Ticketing; Todd Olson, Sales Associate;  Murray White, Sales Associate; Joey Burridge,  Sales  Associate/Ticket  Representative;  Rosalee Brewer, Sales Associate; John Redhead, Executive Director of Business Development; Laura Damico, Director of Community  and Event Development; Shawn Russell, Director of Promotions/Production; Amanda Williams, Director of Creative Services; Yunhui  Bradshaw, Director  of Merchandise; Chad  Green, Assistant Director of Stadium Operations;  Kaid  Musgrave,  Assistant  Groundskeeper; and Bob Perry, Clubhouse Director.  Championship Skipper Andy Haines was  ably assisted by Pitching Coach Willie Glen  and Hitting Coach Kevin Randel. The players  were kept  in championship  form all season  long by Athletic Trainer Masa Fujimoto and  Strength and Conditioning Coach Cody Clark.  On behalf of the citizens of the Sixth District  of North Carolina, we congratulate Greensboro  Grasshoppers owners Cooper Brantley, Wes  Elingburg and Len White and everyone affiliated with  the Hoppers on providing  its  fans  with so many dramatic moments during a  memorable season. All of us who  love  the  Hoppers are basking in the glow of the first  South Atlantic League Championship since  1982. We may see some of  today’s Grasshoppers playing for the parent club—the Florida Marlins—in the near future, but none of us  will forget the 2011 season when Greensboro  came from behind numerous times to win it  all.  f  TRIBUTE TO DARRELL WALTRIP  HON.

Darrell Waltrip will join the third class of inductees  in the NASCAR Hall of Fame.  Darrell was born and raised in Owensboro,  Kentucky, but began making his mark as a  professional driver at the old Nashville Speedway in the 1970s.

728,100,2011-09-23,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Speaker, this week, I reintroduced  the Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act (H.R. 2994), a  bipartisan bill  that will  improve  the research  and development program for marine renewable energy. Marine energy  is an emerging  technology  that presents great opportunities.  Developing the ability to harness energy from  our ocean and  tidal currents  to power our  homes and businesses will create U.S. jobs by  building a new manufacturing industry and will  improve our energy security.  I would  like  to  recognize the leadership of Senator LISAMURKOWSKIwho has  introduced a Senate companion, which she has successfully moved  through  the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Further, I appreciate the  support of my House colleagues Representatives DONYOUNG and THEODOREDEUTCH in  working with me on this bill.  In the Puget Sound area of Washington, research and demonstration on tidal energy are  underway, requiring collaboration from the private sector, universities, research institutions  and public utilities. However, national leadership is needed to truly realize the benefits of  commercial-scale marine hydrokinetic projects  in the United States. The U.S. Department of  Energy established  the Northwest National  Marine Renewable Energy Center, run by the  University of Washington and Oregon State  University, to develop tidal and wave research  projects. They are working with  the private  sector to demonstrate new technologies. Additionally,  the Department of Energy’s Marine  Sciences Laboratory on the Olympic Peninsula  assesses waterpower resource potential to address and remove environmental roadblocks  to deployment, testing to accelerate the integration of  large-scale waterpower electricity  generation into the Northwest power grid, and  is essential to establishing a robust basis for  industrial investment based on verifiable technology performance, assured cost basis, and  environmental performance.  The Marine Renewable Energy Promotion  Act will accelerate these efforts by establishing  a  competitive  research,  development  and  demonstration program at the Department of  Energy that is specifically devoted to marine  and hydrokinetic renewable energy. This office  will help to develop new marine renewable energy technologies, increase reliability and durability of facilities, reduce manufacturing and  operating costs of  the devices, help  identify  and address environmental impacts of marine  renewable energy and make sure  that such  power can be integrated into the national electricity grid. Additionally, the bill will ensure that  the Department of Energy works with research  institutions to set up marine and hydrokinetic  energy test facilities in the United States, supporting efforts underway nationwide and at the  University of Washington, which are critical in  our efforts  to demonstrate a wide  range of  technologies, and evaluate the technical viability of each new and emerging type of technology at different scales.  The Electric Power Research Institute has  estimated that ocean resources in the United  States could generate 252 million megawatt  hours of electricity, which given as much support as other types of renewable energy, could  be equivalent to 6.5 percent of America’s entire electricity generation. With such great potential  to spur American  innovation and  job  creation, I urge my colleagues to support this  important bill.  f  TENNESSEE BAPTIST CHILDREN’S  HOME  HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 23, 2011  ",2011
729,100,2011-09-23,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker, one hundred years ago, a group of women from the  First Baptist Church in Nashville, TN, decided  to put action to their beliefs. Purchasing land  in Brentwood, TN,  in 1911,  the Tennessee  Baptist Orphans’ Home moved from borrowed  space in a local hotel to a permanent home.  This move began a beautiful history of dedication and service to the least and most vulnerable among us.  Approximately 200 children a year are cared  for, fed, clothed, and taught about the hope  found in the Almighty. As children find themselves in houses of great crisis, thanks to the  care and support of  the Tennessee Baptist  Children’s Home, they soon find themselves in  homes of great love. Need is the only qualification for children to find assistance and by  accepting  all  children  regardless  of  race,  creed,  or  socio-economic  background,  the  TBCH lives fully the call of those who follow  Christ.  I appreciate  the great work done by  the  Tennessee Baptist Children’s Home and all  those who support its mission. From the couples who give their lives to parent other children to those whose prayers make this calling  possible, all who offer their time, talents, and  treasures  to  this great cause are helping  to  make the future brighter for Tennessee’s children. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  the Tennessee Baptist Children’s Home and  ask my colleagues to join with me in offering  great thanks for the work done in protecting  Tennessee’s children.  f  TRANSPARENCY  IN REGULATORY  ANALYSIS OF IMPACTS ON THE  NATION ACT OF 2011  SPEECHOF  HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 22, 2011  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the state of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 2401) to require  analyses of the cumulative and incremental  impacts of certain rules and actions of the  Environmental Protection Agency, and for  other purposes:  ",2011
730,100,2011-09-23,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2401. Instead of legislation that  would train Americans to get back to full employment, the majority is bringing to the floor  a bill that harms the health of our nation.  This bill would endanger the health of millions of our nation’s children, seniors, and sick  by blocking rules to reduce cross-state air pollution and to reduce the emissions of mercury,  lead, dioxin, and other  toxic chemicals  from  power plants. H.R. 2401 would also delay future safeguards by requiring studies that only  measure pollution cleanup costs while disregarding health and other benefits.  Along with many of my colleagues,  I  recently sent letters to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in support of the Power  Plant Air Toxics Rule and the Cross-State Air  Pollution Control Rule because of the positive  impact  these  rules will have on  the public  health of our nation. Toxic air pollution from  power plants  remains a major unregulated  source of mercury and lead in the air. Already,  more than half of all coal-fired power plants  use widely available pollution control  technologies  to meet  these  important standards.  Once the rule is final, the remaining 44 percent will take similar steps to decrease dangerous pollutants, saving  thousands of  lives  and avoiding tens of thousands of illnesses. It  is clear that the benefits of the mercury and  air  toxics  standards will  far  outweigh  its  costs—it is estimated that the pollution reductions required by the rule will yield health benefits of $59 billion  to $140 billion per year  (from lower health care costs and higher worker productivity), which  is 5  to 13  times  its  costs.  Further, by delaying the Cross-State Air Pollution Control Rule this bill would allow highly  polluting facilities located upwind to continue  to pollute major metropolitan areas with impunity. Such sources of pollution have made it  VerDate Mar 15 2010  05:00 Sep 24, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A23SE8.045 E23SEPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 6 K S D n o s e m a j t         ",2011
731,7,2011-10-06,Mr. BARROW.," I thank the ranking  member  for the time to express another view on the legislation.  I’m proud to be an original sponsor of  the EPA Regulatory Relief Act. This  legislation was drafted in response to  new EPA  regulations  on  emissions  from industrial boilers. I believe those  regulations,  however well meaning,  cannot reasonably be met with today’s  technologies. I believe that this bill is  a more reasonable solution than that  proposed by the EPA.  The choice before us is not between  the two mutually exclusive outcomes  of dirty air or more jobs. Our challenge  is to promote policies that serve both.  I think this bill strikes a better balance. It will spur industry to make investments that cut down on harmful  air emissions, while minimizing  the  chances  of  negative  economic  consequences and job losses.  I’m proud to have worked in a productive, bipartisan way to get this bill  to the  floor, and encourage my colleagues’ support.  ",2011
732,7,2011-10-06,Mr. WHITFIELD.," At  this  time  I  would like to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman  from Texas  (Mr. HALL), who’s  chairman of  the  Science Committee.  ",2011
733,7,2011-10-06,Mr. HALL.," Mr. Chairman, Chairman  WHITFIELD, of course I rise in support  of H.R. 2250.  As policymakers, it’s our job to use  common sense and judgment to balance  the universal priorities of a  strong  economy, security at home and security abroad, and healthy communities.  And this country has a history of remarkable achievement  in addressing  these priorities. However, with an unemployment rate of more than 9 percent, it’s irresponsible for the executive branch to stifle job growth and, for  that matter, to create job loss through  the outrageous and inflexible negotiations and regulations.  In my  district  alone,  the Boiler  MACT rules threaten more than 800  good-paying manufacturing jobs. These  are not  jobs that can be re-created.  Once eliminated, they’re gone. Several  weeks  ago Assistant Administrator  Gina McCarthy  stated arrogantly,  I  don’t want to create the  impression  that EPA is in the business of creating  jobs.  I feel that statement’s inappropriate  and unfeeling toward those who have  lost their jobs and lost the ability to  provide for their family’s future. H.R.  2250 is a clear statement by Congress  that EPA slow down and allow for reasoning along with some regulations.  The President said that his administration would be the most transparent  in history. Instead, we find clandestine  models, cherry-picking of data, double-  counting of benefits, and a failure to  follow basic peer  review guidelines.  This is a recipe for losing the public’s  trust. EPA needs a timeout, and this  bill provides it.  I urge all my colleagues to support  this bill.  ",2011
734,7,2011-10-06,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Chairman, can  you inform us as to how much time is  remaining on both sides?  The CHAIR. The  gentleman  from  Massachusetts has 11 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Kentucky  has 131⁄4minutes remaining.  ",2011
735,7,2011-10-06,Mr. MARKEY., I yield 5 minutes to  the  gentleman  from Virginia  (Mr.  MORAN).  ,2011
736,7,2011-10-06,Mr. MORAN.," I thank my very good  friend for yielding to me.  Mr. Chairman, a  rigorous peer-reviewed analysis, called ‘‘The Benefits  and Costs of the Clean Air Act from  1990 to 2020,’’ conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency,  found  that  the  air  quality  improvements  under the Clean Air Act will save $2  trillion by 2020, and prevent at least  230,000 deaths annually—230,000  lives  saved on an annual basis. We could  save four times the number of people  killed each year in automobile accidents by reducing air pollution.  Yet, just 2 weeks ago, this Chamber  approved legislation to block the EPA  from implementing rules to clean up  the single largest stationary source of  air pollution. That  legislation gave  this Nation’s oldest and dirtiest coal-  fired power plants another pass to pollute and avoid compliance with the  Clean Air Act.  Today we’re considering legislation,  the EPA Regulatory Relief Act, to exempt the second-largest source of hazardous air pollution:  Industrial and  commercial boilers, process heaters,  and commercial and  industrial solid  waste incinerators.  Under this bill, these large boilers  and  incinerators would be given at  least a 75-month pass from regulation;  a 15-month delay before any new rules  could be issued, and an additional 5  years beyond that delay before any new  emission standards could be issued; and  no deadline  for  industry compliance.  This bill does more than just offer a  pass from regulation. It also ensures  that any final regulation will be weaker than what the law requires.  The final section of this bill deals  with the Clean Air Act’s most protective legal standard for reducing toxic  air pollution, the Maximum Available  Control Technology. After  20 years,  we’re replacing it with the absolutely  least protective of measures,  called  ‘‘work  practice  standards’’  such  as  equipment tuneups that need not even  reduce emissions.  Pass this bill and you sentence hundreds of thousands to asthma attacks  and a lifetime of health complications.  Pass this bill and you saddle our economy with unnecessary costs and employers with millions of additional sick  days. Pass this bill and you trigger an  additional 20,000 heart attacks. Pass  this bill and you condemn tens of thousands of Americans  to a premature  death.  b1000  Mr. Chairman,  the Cement Sector  Regulatory Relief Act that unfortunately will pass today and the TRAIN  Act that passed 2 weeks ago constitute  an all-out war between this Nation’s  dirtiest  industries  and  the Federal  agency charged with protecting  the  public’s health. EPA has become the  symbol, the center, of a debate over the  role of government. It’s a sad commentary for this Chamber that an industry that prefers to invest in the political process rather than in saving  lives by reducing harmful emissions is  in fact winning the debate.  In fact, the coal consuming industries that have underwritten this assault on EPA were  invited early on  during the first year of the Obama administration to sit down and craft a  compliance option. The administration  had hoped to craft a deal similar to the  historic deal it made with the Nation’s  auto  industry on  fuel efficiency and  tailpipe emissions. An article by Coral  Davenport in the September 22 issue of  the National Journal referenced this  meeting. But unlike the auto industry,  the coal consuming industries refused  to negotiate.  Instead, and let me quote from the  article, they ‘‘banded together with the  Republican Party to strategize, and the  2010 midterm elections offered the perfect battleground. The companies invested heavily in campaigns to elect  Tea  Party  candidates  crusading  against the role of Big Government. Industry groups (like the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce), Tea Party groups with  deep ties to polluters (like Americans  for Prosperity), and  so-called  super  PACs  (like  Karl  Rove’s  American  Crossroads) spent record amounts to  help elect the new House Republican  majority.’’  My colleagues, this is a bill peddled  by an industry that refuses to clean up  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:09 Oct 07, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K06OC7.013 H06OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o R E K L A W P         ",2011

739,15,2011-10-06,Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2 of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intention to  raise a question of the privileges of the  House.  The form of the resolution is as follows:  Whereas on October 2, 2011, the Washington  Post reported a story called  ‘‘Rick Perry  And A Word Set On Stone’’;  Whereas upon reading that story the vast  majority of people in the United States were  morally outraged;  Whereas most of the facts in this resolution come from that Washington Post story;  Whereas Governor Rick Perry has  described a childhood  in Haskell County  in  Paint Creek, Texas, as centered on Boy  Scouts, school, and church;  Whereas Texas Governor Rick Perry  is  from West Texas and was originally a Southern Democrat—often known as Dixiecrats—  who switched parties in the late 1980s to become a Republican and is currently a leading  Republican presidential candidate;  Whereas ranchers who once grazed cattle  on the 1,070-acre parcel  in Throckmorton  County on the Clear Fork of the Brazos  River—near  where  Governor  Perry  was  raised in Paint Creek, Texas—it has since become a hunting ground that was called by  the name ‘‘Niggerhead’’ well before Governor  Perry and his father, Ray, began hunting  there in the early 1980s even though there is  no definitive account of when the rock first  appeared on the property;  Whereas the use of the term ‘‘Niggerhead’’  to describe a hunting retreat is morally offensive;  Whereas Ronnie Brooks, a local resident  who guided a few turkey shoots for Governor  Perry between 1985 and 1990, said he holds  Governor Perry ‘‘in the highest esteem’’ but  said this of the rock at the camp: ‘‘It kind of  offended me, truthfully’’;  Whereas Haskell  County  Judge David  Davis, sitting in his courtroom and looking  at a window there, said the word was ‘‘like  those are vertical blinds. It’s just what it  was called. There was no significance other  than a hunting deal’’—in other words, the  judge was morally vacuous;  Whereas the name of this particular parcel  did not change for years and for many remained the same after it became associated  with Rick Perry, first as a private citizen,  then as a State official, and finally as Texas  Governor;  Whereas some local residents still call it  by  the  morally  repugnant  name  ‘‘Niggerhead’’;  Whereas as recently as this summer, the  slab-like rock—lying  flat, portions of the  name still faintly visible beneath a coat of  white paint—remained by the gated entrance  to the camp;  Whereas asked last week about the name,  Governor Perry said the word on the rock is  an offensive name that has no place in the  modern world—implying that it may have  been okay and had an appropriate place in  that community when he was growing up;  Whereas Mae Lou Yeldell has lived in Haskell County, Texas, for 70 years and recalls  the racism she faced in the 1950s and 1960s in  West Texas, when being called an offensive  name—like Whites  greeting Blacks with  ‘‘Morning  nigger’’—was  ‘‘like  a  broken  record’’;  Whereas Throckmorton County, where the  hunting camp is located near Haskell County, was for years considered a virtual no-go  zone for African-Americans because of old  stories told by locals about the lynching of  an African-American man there;  Whereas Haskell County began observing  Martin Luther King Jr. Day just two years  ago according to a county commissioner in  Haskell County;  Whereas Governor Perry grew up in a segregated era whose history has defined and  complicated the careers of many Southern  politicians;  Whereas Governor Perry has spoken often  about how his upbringing in this sparsely  populated farming community influenced his  conservatism;  Whereas Governor Perry  says he mentioned the offensive word on the rock to his  parents shortly after they had signed a lease  and he had visited the property, and they  rather immediately painted over the word  during the next July 4 holiday, but seven  people interviewed by the Washington Post  said they still saw the word on the rock at  various points during the years that the  Perry family was associated with the property through his father, partners, or his signature on a lease;  Whereas another local resident who visited  the property with Governor Perry and the  legislators he brought there to go hunting  recalled seeing the rock with the name clearly visible;  Whereas how, when, or whether Governor  Perry dealt with it when he was using the  property isn’t clear and adds a dimension to  the emerging biography of Governor Perry  who quickly moved into the top tier of Republican presidential candidates when he entered the race in August; and  Whereas Herman Cain is the only Republican presidential candidate to criticize Governor Rick Perry  for being  ‘‘insensitive’’  when the word was not immediately condemned, but we would remind Herman Cain  that the word is not only ‘‘insensitive’’, but  is also ‘‘offensive’’: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) calls on Governor Rick Perry to apologize for not immediately doing away with  the  rock  that  contained  the  word  ‘‘Niggerhead’’ at the entrance of a ranch he  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:09 Oct 07, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A06OC7.032 H06OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o R E K L A W P         ",2011

742,23,2011-10-06,Mr. WAXMAN.," I just want to point  out to my colleagues that what the bill  does is repeals the previous rule, regulation, and then prohibits EPA from  adopting  another  regulation  for  15  months. And when they adopt another  regulation, it can’t be enforced for another  5 years. And  then  there’s no  deadline. But meanwhile, they  lower  the standard for EPA in setting that  regulation.  EPA is in the process now of negotiating with the industry to work out  the information and the problems that  have been brought to their attention.  We ought to give EPA the chance to do  that and get the full input from the industry.  If  legislation  is needed, we  ought to consider what legislation is  needed. The approach of this bill is to  set us back enormously. When you  don’t have anything in place but the  weakest  possible  criteria,  and  then  nothing can happen for 5 years, and  maybe even longer because it takes 15  months to get the regulation, no enforcement for 5 years after that—and  maybe never—that’s not a reasonable  approach.  If the industry wants a law, the industry ought to work on telling us  what they need, and not going on this  escapade with  the Republicans who  would like to repeal the whole Clean  Air Act and repeal the ability of the  EPA to protect the public from toxic  pollution. And, of course, the amendment that’s before us is that insofar as  this bill becomes law, when we’re talking about poisoning children’s brains,  we’re not going to stop EPA from getting their regulations in place and getting  them enforced.  It’s obscene  to  think, the idea that we would wait another 61⁄2years, and maybe longer, before we can do anything to start down  the road to reduce the pollution that’s  going to poison these kids.  I ask  for an  ‘‘aye’’ vote on  the  amendment, and I hope that people realize this is a bill that will pass the  House, but in my view, given the President’s statement of a veto,  it’s not  going to become law.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

747,23,2011-10-06,The Acting CHAIR.," The Clerk will  designate the amendment.

749,23,2011-10-06,Mr. RUSH.," Mr. Chairman, let us not  be distracted by this confused, backward, and short-term thinking on the  part of our Republican colleagues. This  bill represents just another attack on  the Nation’s  long-standing  environmental protection laws in general and  the EPA in particular.  On behalf of a select few polluting industries  that operate under  the assumption that the timing is right to  permanently alter, gut, and obliterate  the Clean Air Act, the law that the  chairman  of  the  subcommittee  and  many others have said is working on  behalf of the American people.  While most  businesses  have  been  planning and preparing for these rules,  which have already been delayed for  years and in some cases have been delayed over a decade, some of the more  opportunistic dirty industries see this  radical Republican majority and their  radical agenda targeting the EPA and  all of our clean air laws as the perfect  time to try and permanently alter the  Clean Air Act.  Section 5 of H.R. 2250 disregards the  clean air standards that will help reduce toxic air pollution, like mercury  and soot from some of our Nation’s biggest polluters—cement plants,  industrial boilers, and incinerators.  Instead, this section would make fundamental and damaging changes to the  Clean Air Act and would ensure that  future standards do not meaningfully  reduce emissions into the air.  b1300  So, Mr. Chairman, I must offer an  amendment that will clarify that section 5 of H.R. 2250 is intended to supplement the provisions of and shall not  be construed to supersede any requirement, limitation or other provision of  sections 112 and 129 of the Clean Air  Act.  This single provision in section 5 will  have the effect of exempting incinerators, exempting industrial boilers, and  exempting cement plants  from maximum reductions in toxic air pollution  emissions, in contrast to every other  major industrial source of toxic air pollution in this Nation.  The majority, even after being asked  repeatedly  over  and  over  and  over  again, has yet to explain why Congress  should carve out exemptions for the  Nation’s dirtiest polluters, in total disregard  for the public health of the  American people and at the expense of  those very companies that have already  invested  in the technology to  meet  the minimum  requirements of  this law.  Mr. Chairman, if it is truly the majority’s intent to clarify the rules and  to provide certainty for business, then  this amendment will accomplish that  purpose; but I don’t believe that that is  their intent, and I don’t believe that  that is what their goal and objectives  are. They have a singular purpose in all  of these bills that we have been debating on this floor as it relates to the  Clean Air Act, and that  is to completely nullify and gut the Clean Air  Act so that polluters in this Nation can  keep on polluting the very air that we  breathe.  So, Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my  colleagues to support my amendment.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. YODER). The  time of the gentleman from Illinois has  expired.  (On request of Mr. WAXMAN, and by  unanimous consent, Mr. RUSHwas allowed  to  proceed  for  1  additional  minute.)  ",2011
750,23,2011-10-06,Mr. RUSH., I yield to the ranking  member.  ,2011
751,23,2011-10-06,Mr. WAXMAN.," I thank you for yielding to me. I want to join you in urging  support for this amendment.  Whatever the motivation is of your  legislation—and I can understand your  reason for being very skeptical. I share  it. But what the industry should want  is regulatory certainty. And this bill  adds more confusion to what is already  a long overdue effort to reduce toxic  air pollution from boilers and incinerators. With no timeline for implementation of new emissions standards, the  bill creates significant questions about  how EPA would set limits for toxic air  pollution. If they think it’s regulatory  certainty that they don’t have to do  anything for years, they’d better not  count on it. And if they want regulatory certainty, they’d better come  forward and work something out.  In the meantime, your clarification  provides  the  certainty,  and  I urge  Members to support it.

757,39,2011-10-06,Ms. SEWELL.," Thank you so much. I  was  born  in Selma, Alabama,  and  raised in Selma, and my home church  is Brown Chapel AME Church. And I remember so many commemorations of  the march from Selma to Montgomery  always  culminated  on  that Sunday  when they commemorate Bloody Sunday in my church. And I can remember  often seeing Reverend Shuttlesworth  at Brown Chapel and crossing that Edmund Pettus Bridge that he did so  often in those commemorations.  My last time seeing him, he participated in a Faith in Politics luncheon  that we had this past year, this past  March and when I was so honored to  co-host that Faith in Politics pilgrimage back to Alabama with Congressman LEWIS.  I know that my generation owes a  debt of gratitude to the Freedom Riders, to the folks, the civil rights activists such as Reverend Shuttlesworth  and JOHNLEWIS. We owe so much to  them. We not only  stand on  their  shoulders, but we pay honor and tribute to them always. They fought the  good fight so that people like us could  go to Ivy League schools, could walk  the Halls of Congress, and I’m just forever grateful  for  their courage and  their sacrifice.  b1550  I am equally thrilled to now yield  time to Congressman JOHNLEWIS of  Georgia. The gentleman from Georgia  is one of my own personal heroes and  will  speak  to  knowing  Fred  Shuttlesworth personally and talk of  the  times  in  the  sixties  that  they  shared together. I am just immensely  honored to be able to call Congressman  LEWISa friend as well as colleague.  ",2011
758,39,2011-10-06,Mr. LEWIS of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  I want to thank my friend and colleague, Congresswoman TERRISEWELL  from Birmingham,  for holding  this  Special Order. Thank you  for  representing the people of the Seventh  Congressional District of Alabama, especially Birmingham and Selma.  I grew up reading and hearing about  Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, the man  from Birmingham, Alabama. I grew up  about 150 miles from Birmingham outside of a little town called Troy. The  words of Fred Shuttlesworth, the actions of this man were so inspiring, I  probably wouldn’t be  standing here  today, I know I wouldn’t be standing  here today as a Member of Congress  representing the good people of the  Fifth District of Georgia if it hadn’t  been  for  individuals  like  Fred  Shuttlesworth.  The Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth is  the last of a kind. He was a fearless, determined, courageous leader for civil  rights and social justice. When others  did not have the courage to stand up,  speak  up  and  speak  out,  Fred  Shuttlesworth put all he had on the  line to end segregation and racial discrimination not only in Birmingham  but throughout the State of Alabama  and throughout our Nation.  As has been said so well before, he  was beaten with chains, his home was  bombed, his church was bombed, and he  lived under constant threat of violence  and murder; but he never, ever  lost  faith in the power of love to overcome  hate.  He escorted brave young children to  desegregate  public  schools  in  Birmingham. In 1961, and I will never, ever  forget it, when I was only 21 years old,  during the Freedom Rides, 50 years  ago, when others were immobilized by  fear, he was fearless and met us at the  Greyhound bus station in Birmingham,  Alabama, and welcomed us  into his  home. When we were trapped in the  First Baptist Church a few days later,  pastored by the Reverend Ralph Abernathy in downtown Montgomery, after  we had been beaten by an angry mob  and the church had been surrounded by  individuals who  tried  to  burn  the  church down, he stood up and he spoke.  He gave us courage. He told us not to  be afraid.  He worked tirelessly beside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and others as he  led the Birmingham Movement. In 1963  when Bull Connor, the commissioner of  public safety, used dogs and fire hoses  on peaceful protesters, including young  children  and  women,  Fred  Shuttlesworth was there.  And I will never  forget, Congresswoman SEWELL, when we went back to  Selma  in  2007, Fred Shuttlesworth  wanted to cross that bridge one more  time. He was unable to walk. He was in  a wheelchair. Then-Senator Barack  Obama pushed  the chair across  the  bridge. Former President Clinton came  and kneeled down at the chair in front  of Fred Shuttlesworth to pay tribute  and homage to him.  This brave and courageous man must  be remembered. In my estimation, he  is one of the Founding Fathers of the  New America. He helped liberate, not  just the State of Alabama, not just the  South, but he helped liberate America;  and  that’s why we honor him. He  helped change and made us a different  people, made us stand up, walk, run,  and march with pride. We owe him a  debt of gratitude. He will be deeply  missed.  When we go back to Birmingham, or  to Montgomery, or to Selma, or any  part of the American South, we may  see a statue at the Civil Rights Institute or Museum in Birmingham, but we  will see Fred Shuttlesworth all over  VerDate Mar 15 2010  02:41 Oct 07, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K06OC7.091 H06OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o R E K L A W P         ",2011

761,47,2011-10-06,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I have the  rare opportunity today to  introduce  and say a few words about the guest  Chaplain. Reverend Chaney has just delivered, as usual, an eloquent invocation.  Reverend Chaney is originally from  South Carolina, but for the last 2 years  he has led the flock of the Second Baptist Church in Las Vegas, one of the  oldest, extremely well-established, and  largest churches in Las Vegas, NV. He  is a man who is involved in the community very deeply. He  serves on  the  board of the Urban League and the  NAACP.  In addition to his service in the spiritual realm, he has also served as a patriot in our Nation’s armed services.  He served in the Navy for 4 years, as  has our Chaplain, Dr. Barry Black.  They were both naval officers. Reverend Chaney recently retired as chaplain of the U.S. Air Force Reserve at  Nellis Air Force Base.  I have met with Reverend Chaney  under very unique circumstances on a  number of occasions. He is a wonderful  human being. He is one of those rare  people who have such a pleasant demeanor. The minute a person meets  him, they know he is a man of great  substance and spiritual quality. So I  am very happy to welcome Reverend  Chaney and his wife Avis to Washington.  I thank the pastor for the inspiring  invocation, which I hope will guide the  Senate’s action today.  f  SCHEDULE  ",2011

772,55,2011-10-06,Mr. BEGICH.," Mr. President, as were  many of my colleagues, I was back  home last week talking, in my case, to  Alaskans,  and  the  issues  on  their  minds are pretty simple: the economy  and jobs. Alaska has fared better than  most States over the last 2 years, but  no matter where I go—maybe a small  convenience store, while I am driving  around town or at Home Depot, a gas  station,  or wherever  I may  get  a  chance to engage with Alaskans—people are concerned about the economy  and the ability for jobs to be created in  this great country of ours.  Alaskans know  the  economy will  take some time to turn around. That is  why today I am pleased to talk a little  bit about the jobs act before us this  week and, hopefully, while moving forward we will spend some time on the  debate about how important this work  will be.  Last week when I was in Alaska, I  had Transportation Secretary LaHood  in Alaska, and we had a chance to travel around and get a good sense of what  is important to Alaska with regard to  ports, roads, airports, and rail. The  core infrastructure of our State is no  different than any other State. It is  critical that we repair, put into shape,  some of the facilities that are falling  apart or, in some cases, expand them.  The jobs act alone would mean $200  million  to  repair Alaska’s  transportation network.  As one can imagine, that $200 million  will be spent in the private sector by  construction companies and contractors hiring private individuals, workers  to work on  those  jobs—good-paying  jobs to provide good incomes for their  families. The same is true that the jobs  act will offer  for Alaska around $62  million for school construction.  As I travel around my State—and I  am sure  for many other States—the  need is strong for improvements to and  expansion of  schools  for  those  that  have been there for many years and  have not had  the  renovations necessary, again, providing hundreds and  hundreds of jobs.  The jobs act also has some good steps  to deal with small businesses—how to  ensure they get a break off their taxes,  to ensure they have a benefit as we try  to move this economy forward. The tax  provisions, the payroll tax reduction,  which would affect 20,000 Alaska businesses in a positive way, will reduce  their tax burden, as well as working  families, who will see a reduction in  their payroll taxes.  On average, for a middle-class family, it would be almost $2,000—not a  bad gift, in a sense, as we move into  this holiday season. But it is really  their money. Giving back this $2,000 to  middle-class families means they will  put  it  into the economy. They will  spend it in the economy. They will use  it as they see fit.  However, I wish to lay down a marker. As I have said, the jobs bill is important for the roads and water and  sewer and ports that need to be repaired and renovated and expanded, the  schools that need to be built or expanded and repaired also, as well as the  benefits to our small business community and the benefits to our middle-  class working families—all important.  But how we pay for it is also important  because we have to make sure it is paid  for. But I wish to put down a marker  on at least the first proposal that was  laid down regarding how the President  was planning to pay for this.  Let me first start with the oil and  gas industry. The oil and gas industry  for Alaska is about 85 percent of our  economy in the sense that the money  goes into our State treasury and provides well over 40,000 jobs. Nationwide,  the oil and gas industry produces over  9 million jobs and contributes over $2  trillion to our economy.  I know some of my colleagues on my  side of the aisle like to blast Big Oil.  But as we know, the oil and gas industry is made up of hundreds, well over  500 companies of all sizes—small, medium-sized, and large. Singling out a  growing industry and imposing a tax  penalty,  in my view,  is  the wrong  choice. It is the wrong road to go down.  We need to recognize the potential for  more  job  creation  instead  by  supporting increased domestic oil and gas  development.  By developing Alaska’s Arctic offshore resources alone, we can create  over 50,000  jobs nationwide over the  coming decade, jobs being created right  here in our country. As an example, 400  jobs just in Washington to upgrade the  Kulluk drilling unit which will be utilized in Alaska or the 1,000 jobs in Louisiana to build a new Arctic supply ship  right now.  So when we look at the potential,  and when we look at the opportunities  in the Arctic for oil and gas development, it creates American jobs, American  jobs not only  in the Arctic  in  Alaska but also throughout the country where many of the facilities or the  material utilized  is  located  to construct what is needed, such as in Washington State and Louisiana, as I mentioned.  Also, Federal revenue would be generated. The Chamber of Commerce has  estimated that developing and increasing production on Federal lands could  produce well over $200 billion in new  revenues to our country.  An Alaska analysis puts the Federal  revenues just for Beaufort and Chukchi  Sea at $160 billion. For those who are  not  familiar with where  those are,  those are just above the North Slope in  the Arctic. These have a potential of  well over 24 billion barrels of oil development in the known technically recoverable reserves today—upwards to  24 billion, 26 billion.  I will tell you I do support—and I understand in the original proposal they  wanted to take away some of these tax  incentives that help our industry move  forward, especially the smaller companies to expand exploration and development. I recognize that tax reform needs  to be done, and I am a strong supporter  of tax reform. Senator WYDENand Senator COATS and  I have supported a  piece of legislation that is all about tax  reform. I believe in a holistic proposal,  not just selective industries. So do not  get me wrong. Do I believe in tax reform? Do I believe in trying to clear  out loopholes and incentives that are  not working or may be used improperly? Absolutely. Again, that is why we  supported a much broader perspective.  But in pay-fors or tax proposals to pay  for the jobs bill, this is not the right  approach.  Another concern I have is on aviation. Alaska has 6 times more pilots  and 16 times more aircraft per capita  than any other State in the country.  Alaska has limited road infrastructure.  Eighty percent of our communities are  accessed not by roads but by water or  air. So it is critical we have the right  kind of aviation system.  General aviation is not a luxury in  Alaska, it is a necessity. It is our highway in the sky. That is the utilization  of our airlines and small planes. The  general aviation component is critical  for business, life safety, moving things  from one village to another.  One piece of the President’s jobs bill  would change the way businesses can  treat the depreciation of general aviation aircraft and create a disincentive  to buy American-made aircraft and further depress an industry that has already felt a significant impact due to  the recession.

774,71,2011-10-06,Mr. ENZI.," Madam President, if I had  the time, I would contest a few things  my colleague from Illinois said, but I  am not going  to make a political  speech; I am going to speak on the bill  that  is currently before  the Senate  which is the China currency bill.  So I rise to speak on the China currency bill. China’s undervaluation of  its currency is a serious problem. It is  an issue I studied when I was a member  of the Senate Banking Committee and  now as a member of the Finance Committee. Earlier this year, I also had an  opportunity to visit China with a number of my colleagues and learn more  about this issue as we met with their  government officials.  It is clear the efforts of the Chinese  Government  to  peg  its  currency  against the dollar give unfair benefits  to the Chinese exporters at the expense  of U.S. manufacturers. The United  States should take additional action to  pressure their government to reevaluate Chinese currency.  However, this is not a new problem.  China currency has been a priority for  both President George W. Bush and  President Obama. Through a number of  venues, including the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade talks, our  officials at all levels have raised this  issue with little response. This experience shows that action by the United  States alone is not enough. We know  other major global trading powers have  the same concern, but we continue to  act individually. Just this summer, the  German Government made a renewed  attempt to gain more flexibility in China’s currency. The full European Union  has followed suit, but they, too, have  had little gain. But the United States  and the European Union are not the  only ones concerned about China currency. A number of emerging economies, including both India and Brazil,  have also made the same plea. So the  question I ask now is why are we considering a bill that puts the United  States in a position of going it alone?  That is one reason I am a cosponsor  of the Hatch amendment No. 680. This  substitute amendment retains the designations  included  in the underlying  bill that define a ‘‘fundamentally misaligned currency’’ while giving direction to the administration to pursue  action through multilateral channels.  The amendment also thinks forward by  making the issue of currency misalignment a priority issue in both our current trade negotiations and in future  trade agreements. It is important that  the United States not act by  itself  when it comes to pressuring China on  this issue. I have found in my experience that when it comes to economic  policy in our globalized world, the multilateral approach is the most successful. That is one reason I do not support  imposing  unilateral  economic  sanctions on any nations. I am hopeful the  Senate will have an opportunity to  vote on and include the Hatch amendment in this bill.  I also wish to speak about an amendment I am working on with my colleague from Oregon, Senator MERKLEY.  Given that this bill is about enforcement of trade obligations, we filed an  amendment that would encourage our  officials to counternotify those nations  that have failed to report on the government subsidies that are provided to  industries  engaged  in  international  trade and in competition with us. The  World Trade Organization agreement  on subsidies and countervailing measures establishes base rules  for when  VerDate Mar 15 2010  03:22 Oct 07, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G06OC6.041 S06OCPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 6 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2011
775,79,2011-10-06,Mr. BAUCUS.," Madam President,  I  rise to speak at this watershed moment  in the U.S.-China relationship. This is  a relationship that will affect our children’s future. And how we manage this  relationship now will help determine  the long-term strength of our Nation.  Warren Buffett has an answer  for  anyone who questions America’s  future.  As he said earlier this year:  The prophets of doom have overlooked the  all-important factor that is certain: Human  potential  is  far  from exhausted, and the  American system for unleashing that potential—a system that has worked wonders for  over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War—remains alive and effective . . . Now, as in 1776,  1861, 1932 and 1941, America’s best days lie  ahead.  I agree.  America has the world’s best universities, a tradition of brilliant entrepreneurship, and the drive and ingenuity  of our people.  We gave the world the light bulb, the  airplane, the Polio vaccine, the personal computer, and the Internet. We  have been the world’s engine of innovation for more than a century.  But we cannot rest on our laurels. We  can and must rise to the challenge of  China. This is a challenge I recognized  long ago. That is why I led the effort to  grant permanent normal  trade  relations to China, so we could begin to get  China to play by the rules.  That is also why I have traveled to  China eight different times, to stress to  their leaders the importance of playing  by those rules.  China has grown explosively during  that time period. It is now the second-  largest economy in the world. And it  continues to expand.  China’s growth presents real opportunities for American entrepreneurs and  workers. Over the last decade, our exports to China have increased by close  to 500 percent. That is eight times faster than the growth of our exports to  the rest of the world. China is now the  third-largest market in the world for  U.S. exports. And it is the number one  market for U.S. agricultural exports.  But we should not blind ourselves to  the very real challenges that China  also poses to American entrepreneurs  and workers. Too often, China seeks an  unfair  advantage  in  international  trade, including by manipulating the  value of its currency.  In my most recent trip to China last  November, I met with Vice President  Xi Jinping and other top leaders. We  discussed a broad range of issues.  On currency, my message was clear:  China needed to allow its currency to  appreciate more quickly to market levels. If not, the U.S. Congress  likely  would take up—and pass—currency legislation.  Since my trip, China has only allowed its currency to appreciate by 3  percent. The Chinese government continues to  intervene to keep  its currency significantly below its real market value. That is why I intend to support this bill.  I did not come to this decision lightly. I have never favored unilateral approaches. But the time has come to  take action.  And  the United  States  needs  a  thoughtful China policy that takes action on other fronts as well. The currency issue is only one of many problems  facing American companies  in  China.  The problem of intellectual property  theft in China is enormous. To cite but  one example, an astounding 80 percent  of the software  installed on Chinese  computers is pirated. That represents  an enormous lost opportunity for U.S.  software  companies, who  lead  the  world in innovation.  And China bars many of our exports  from entering its market at all. China  shuts out American beef exports entirely. And it imposes barriers that effectively prevent  the entry of U.S.  companies into its banking, insurance,  and telecommunications sectors.  So while this bill addresses an important piece of  the puzzle,  it  is not  enough for China to appreciate its currency. China can and must take action  to address  these other problems as  well.  Ultimately, though, America’s future  as a great economic power will not be  dictated by what China does. It will be  dictated by what we do. It is about us.  It is about the principles that made  America great. It is about our freedom,  our  justice, our democracy, and the  will, creativity, and endurance of our  people. And it is about what we must  do to get our own house in order so  that we can continue to compete and  win on the global stage.  We must focus on policies and initiatives that encourage American entrepreneurship.  We must nurture and protect American  innovation, both at home and  abroad. That is why I introduced a bill  to strengthen the research and development tax credit and make it permanent.  We also must reform our Tax Code to  unleash new investment and make college more accessible. That  is why I  have been holding a series of Finance  Committee hearings to pave the way  for tax reform.  And we must work together to open  export markets  around  the world.  That’s why  I  strongly  support  the  pending free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.  We  took  an  important  step  last  month to pave the way for these trade  agreements when we renewed trade adjustment assistance with a strong bipartisan vote. It is now time to approve the trade agreements themselves  so that American entrepreneurs, workers, farmers, and ranchers can unlock  the potential of these key export markets.  So as we debate this bill, let us not  forget that the currency issue is only  one of many challenges in our relationship with China. Let us also be mindful  of our larger challenges both at home  and abroad. And let us continue to nurture American entrepreneurship here  at home so that we remain the world’s  engine of innovation.  As long as we do so, we can be sure  that, as always, America’s best days lie  ahead.  ",2011

783,87,2011-10-06,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Yes. Let me, for  the benefit of our colleagues, explain  what, in fact, happened. It is not complicated.  It was pretty  clear, whether you  liked this bill or did not, it was going  to pass. You could tell that by cloture  on the motion to proceed with a very  large majority. So I do not think my  good friend the majority leader had to  worry about whether his bill was ultimately going to pass. The question was  whether there were going to be any  amendments at any point to the bill.  And my conference made a decision—  actually against my best advice—to go  on and invoke cloture on the bill after  we had no amendments. The reason we  had no amendments is because the majority leader used a device we have all  become too familiar with called filling  the tree, thereby allowing no amendments he does not approve. And he said  that we are open for amendments, but  what he means is this: We are open for  any amendment I approve. So he filled  the tree and, prior to cloture on the  bill, controlled whether any amendments would be allowed and chose not  to allow any, as a practical matter. So  against my best advice, my conference  decided to invoke cloture on the bill.  So we were moving to approving the  bill with no expression whatsoever.  So we have in the postcloture environment the motion to suspend, which  has not been abused by this minority—  not been abused by this minority. The  majority  leader,  in effect, has overruled the Chair with a simple majority  vote and established the precedent that  even one single motion to suspend—  even one—is dilatory,  changing  the  rules of the Senate. And if you look  back at his bill, what we have had, in  effect, is no amendments before cloture, no motions to suspend after cloture, no expression on the part of the  minority at all.  I do not know why anybody should  act as though they were offended by  nongermane amendments. This is the  Senate. We do not have any rules of  germaneness. No, we do not. Any subject on any bill can be offered as an  amendment. We all know that.  The  fundamental problem here  is  that the majority never likes to take  votes. That is the core problem. And I  can remember, when I was the whip in  the majority, saying to my members  over and over again, when they were  whining about casting votes they did  not want to vote, that the price of  being in the majority is that you have  to take bad votes because in the Senate,  the minority  is entitled  to be  heard—not entitled to win but entitled  to be heard. So that is the core problem.  I would say to my friend the majority leader—and this is nothing personal  about him; I like him, and we deal with  each  other  every  day—we  are  fundamentally turning the Senate into the  House: no amendments before cloture,  no motions to suspend after cloture,  and the minority is out of business.  And it is particularly bad on a bill that  has the support of over 60 Members, as  this one did. If you are not among  those 60, you are out of luck.  Now, look, this is a bad mistake. The  way you get business done in the Senate is to be prepared to take bad votes.  At some point, if 60 Members of the  Senate want a bill to pass, it will pass.  If 60 Members of the Senate do not  want a bill to pass, it will not pass. It  is more time consuming. I assume that  is why a lot of people ran for the Senate instead of the House—because they  wanted to be able to express themselves. This  is a  free-wheeling body,  and everybody is better off when we operate that way. Everybody is, whether  you are in the majority or the minority, because today’s minority may be  tomorrow’s majority, and the country  is better off to have at least one place  where there  is extended debate and  where you have  to  reach a  supermajority to do things.  So I would say to my good friend the  majority leader that I understand his  frustration. But you were going to win  on this bill. You did not need to jam  us. You should not jam us on any bill,  but on this bill you were going to win.  Now, some of us think we were wasting  our time because, as the Senator from  Tennessee said, this was not going to  become law anyway, and we are sitting  around here when we ought to be passing trade bills.  The President has asked us to vote  on his jobs bill. I wanted to give him an  opportunity to have his vote the other  day. You guys did not even want to  vote on what the President was asking  us to vote on without any changes. But  you can prevent that, and you did.  Look,  let’s not change this place.  America does not need less debate, it  needs more debate. And when 60 Members of the Senate decide to pass something, it will pass.  I think we made a big mistake tonight. As soon as we all kind of cool off  and think about it over the weekend, I  hope we will undo what we did tonight  because it is not in the best interests of  this institution or the American people.  ",2011
784,87,2011-10-06,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The majority leader.  ,2011
785,87,2011-10-06,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, the Senate  should function like the Senate. I acknowledge that. But we have major  pieces of  legislation that have been  brought down as a result of not being  able to have finality of that legislation, unending amendments that are  not germane or relevant. The small  business  innovation  bill  that  had  passed in past years easily, we had the  Economic  Development  Administration bill that passed easily in the past,  job-creating bills on which we had an  open amendment process—they were  simply stopped.  There are rules of germaneness in the  Senate. There are rules of germaneness  in the Senate. Let’s think about these  amendments that I agreed to. There  are others I did not agree to, but there  are  amendments  that  I  agreed we  should have a vote on, not that I wanted to have a vote on them because they  had nothing to do with the underlying  bill—nothing. There are rules of germaneness that that should be the case.  DeMint amendment,  right  to work;  Cornyn amendment, fighter planes to  Taiwan—we already had a vote on that,  but we agreed to have another one;  Hatch amendment—that one  is  relevant  and  it  is  germane; Barrasso  amendment,  cement—not  so;  Paul,  Federal funding; Coburn, foreign aid;  McConnell, jobs act.  Part of cloture is enforcing germaneness. That is what it is all about. We  are happy to do germane amendments.  But the fact is, the Republican leader  himself decided not to have amendments on this bill. I agreed to amendments on the bill prior to cloture. Everybody probably does not know that;  they should because that is the way it  is.  So we have to make the Senate a better place, and I think a better place is  to do what was done tonight, to get rid  of these dilatory amendments. I mean,  we would be happy  if poor Senator  BINGAMAN could get some bills out of  the Energy Committee. We could do  something on cement. If we could get  some bills out of the Foreign Relations  Committee, we could maybe look at  foreign aid.  These things are dilatory and only  unnecessary, in an effort to divert from  what we are really trying to do here;  that is, legislate.  So the issue is this: I believe what we  did at the beginning of this Congress  was the right thing to do, but as the  weeks  and months have  rolled  on,  wasting months of our time on a CR  that was done—on a series of CRs—1  week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks—to fund the  government until October, a few days  ago—what a waste of time.

786,95,2011-10-06,Mr.  GRASSLEY.,"  Mr.  President,  today,  I have  the great honor and  pleasure to recognize this year’s Fellows for the Davidson Institute for Talent Development. This year, 18 young  people under the age of 18 have been  awarded scholarships of $50,000, $25,000,  or $10,000 for having demonstrated superior ability and achievement and  having completed a significant piece of  work in the areas of science, music, literature, mathematics, or technology. I  would like to take this time to introduce each of these scholars and the  various projects they have undertaken.  In the area of science, we have eight  young  students  with  remarkable  projects that have contributed to scientific progress. Among this group of  scholars  is Shalini Ramanan. A  17-  year-old young woman from Richland,  WA, Shalini Ramanan worked with a  natural dietary component of the spice  turmeric called BC to test its effectiveness  in  treating  cardiovascular diseases. Through cell migration assays  and western blot techniques, she discovered that BC inhibited platelet-derived  growth  factor  (PDGF)-induced  vascular smooth muscle cell migration  and  signaling. Using bioinformatics,  she identified target genes connected  with signaling pathways. PDGF-stimulated cell-migration and proliferation  are key pathological events in a variety  of  diseases  including  atherosclerosis and cancer. Her studies may  help design and characterize novel drug  molecules with clinical applications.  A  17-year-old  young man  from  Mahopac, NY, Jayanth Krishnan developed an approach to infer regulatory  mechanisms governing changes in gene  expression and identified possible proteins that induce cancer. By creating a  web interface that could predict transcription  factors  for  dis-regulated  genes, and mathematical models using  MATLAB, he was able to predict proteins that are correlated with certain  cancer  families. Using this  information, he calculated several combinations of drugs, for 60 different cancers,  that have the potential to counteract  the inducing agents and better guide  therapeutics.  Lucy Wang,  a  17-year-old  young  woman from Garnet Valley, PA, developed a predictive model to detect adolescent depression with an overall correct classification of 83.66 percent. Untreated depression is the No. 1 cause of  suicide and the third leading cause of  death among teenagers. Using factor  analysis and logistic regression, she focused on quantifying variables  that  may lead to adolescent depression, including  student  self-reported  experiences and demographics.

787,127,2011-10-06,Mr. ROSKAM.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  highlight the good work of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund.  The  Juvenile  Diabetes  Research  Fund  began in 1970 from a parent’s idea to begin  a  fundraising effort with  the aim  to promote  the research of a cure for juvenile diabetes.  To date,  the organization has  raised more  than $1.5 billion,  including $107 million  last  year alone. More  than 80 percent of  those  funds go directly to support research and research-related education.  JDRF now has over 100 locations around  the world and currently funds research in 19  countries.  Diabetes and  its  complications  cost  the  United States more than $174 billion a year  and it is a growing epidemic. Every year, there  are roughly 30,000 new cases of Type-1 diabetes discovered  in America and more  than  1.6 million cases of diabetes are diagnosed  every year. That’s one every 30 seconds.  Type-1 Diabetes  typically  affects  young  adults and children. They are  forced at a  young age to learn how to monitor their blood  levels and inject insulin when it’s low. This can  also be a worrisome and anxious experience.  This is why we must encourage the Food  and Drug Administration to continue in its approval process for the artificial pancreas. Earlier this year, 60 Senators and 250 Representatives sent a letter to the FDA Commissioner  Margaret Hamburg expressing  their support  for the artificial pancreas.  This new device will allow children to return  to their lives and give parents the peace of  mind in knowing that their children will not forget to check their insulin levels. The artificial  pancreas  is a device  that can automatically  monitor and regulate glucose levels without requiring blood to be drawn.  Jeffrey Brewer, President  and CEO  of  JDRF,  said,  ‘‘An artificial pancreas, which  would automatically monitor and regulate glucose levels, has the potential to transform the  care of people with type 1 diabetes.’’ It estimated the artificial pancreas could save Medicare $23 million over 10 years and $1.9 billion  over 25 years by lowering the number of complications associated with the disease.  I am hopeful that the FDA will stick to its  publicly announced December 2011 draft guidance deadline. This will allow us to move into  the crucial next phase of real world testing of  this potentially life saving device. I would urge  my colleagues to continue to monitor this situation and ensure that the FDA stays true to  their word on the guidance.  There may not be a cure for diabetes yet  but with organizations like the JDRF leading  the way in encouraging research and funding  grant programs we are getting closer to a cure  each day.  f  RECOGNIZING THE  446TH AIRLIFT  WING  FOR  EARNING  THE AIR  FORCE  MERITORIOUS  UNIT  AWARD  HON.

788,127,2011-10-06,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today to recognize the 446th Airlift Wing  for earning  the Air Force Meritorious Unit  Award. The award  reflects  the wing’s outstanding  performance  flying  combat  and  peacetime missions between 2008 and 2010.  The 446th Airlift Wing is Washington State’s  only Air Force Reserve  flying unit and performs roughly 44 percent of all C–17 missions  leaving McChord Field located on Joint Base  Lewis-McChord. Having won this accolade in  2007, this honor marks the second time the  446th Airlift Wing has earned the Meritorious  Unit Award.  The Meritorious Unit Award was established  in 2004 to recognize organizations for exceptional achievement or service in direct support  of combat operations. The 2,100 airmen who  make up the 446th Airlift Wing are honored for  contributing directly to national objectives and  continuously demonstrating their combat readiness as  they  fulfilled global peacetime and  wartime operations. Flying more  than 9,700  missions  in more  than 42,000  flying hours  averaging 2,000 missions every four months  to 11 different Iraqi airfields proves that this  unit is nothing short of exemplary.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize the  446th for its performance and its commitment  to serving the United States. I ask that my colleagues  in  the House  of Representatives  please join me in congratulating the 446th Airlift Wing for receiving the Air Force Meritorious  Unit Award.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF REVEREND  FRED L.

789,127,2011-10-06,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  an  instrumental  figure  in  the Civil Rights  Movement, Reverend Fred L. Shuttlesworth.  Reverend Shuttlesworth passed away at  the  age of 89.  Born in Montgomery County, Alabama, Reverend Shuttlesworth was no stranger  to  frequent discrimination and violence as he lived  out his  life. Having endured countless beatings,  bombings,  and  arrests,  Reverend  Shuttlesworth would become a leading force in  the historic fight for equal rights.  Reverend Shuttlesworth was one of the primary pillars of the iconic ‘‘Big Three,’’ founded  conjointly with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  and Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, and others.  While Reverend Shuttlesworth may not have  been as much of a household name as Dr.  King,  for example, his contributions  to  the  Movement were irrefutably just as pivotal to its  success.  Reverend Shuttlesworth was a major actor  in  the  formation of  the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, SCLC, a civil rights  organization that helped to mobilize thousands  of people during  rallies and protests  in  the  name of equality. He also helped to organize  the Freedom Rides through his work with the  Congress on Racial Equality, CORE. Also  known for his outspoken and aggressive advocacy, Reverend Shuttlesworth worked closely  with Dr. King to maintain momentum behind  the Movement whenever Dr. King’s conciliatory approach may have  failed. Today, his  contributions  remain clear and his personal  sacrifices revered.  Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened by this  tremendous loss. Reverend Shuttlesworth was  a well-respected and principled individual who  was fearless even in the face of insurmountable odds. Reverend Shuttlesworth selflessly  endured great personal sacrifice so  that he  could perpetuate a movement that went well  beyond his own life. For that I rise to honor his  lasting contributions to this nation.  f  A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT  OF U.S. POLICY TOWARD SUDAN  HON. CHRISTOPHER H.

Mr. Speaker,  earlier this week, the Subcommittee on Africa,  Global Health, and Human Rights, which  I  chair, held a hearing  that examined a wide  range of  issues  involving U.S. policy  toward  Sudan,  including  the  ongoing  attacks  on  Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile states, the  continuing negotiations with  the Republic of  South Sudan on challenges such as the demarcation of the border, the fate of the Abyei  region, citizenship  in both countries and oil  revenue sharing. Additionally, this hearing provided opportunities  to receive an update on  the U.S. response to the enduring stalemate  on Darfur and to examine U.S. policy on the  release of Sudanese still held  in bondage  throughout Sudan.  Two months ago, the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights held an  emergency hearing on the attacks by the Republic of  the Sudan on  its own Southern  Kordofan state. The crisis first arose in June,  shortly after  the military  forces of  the Khartoum government attacked the disputed Abyei  area. This was apparently a provocation to the  Sudanese People’s Liberation Movement, or  SPLM, government  in what  is now South  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

790,135,2011-10-06,Mr. PAYNE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in  honor of the Mediterranean Quarterly, a journal of global issues published by Duke University Press in the late in 1980s. Mediterranean  Quarterly is edited by Dr. Nikolaos A. Stavrou  (Professor Emeritus of  International Affairs,  Howard University), a true believer in intellectual honesty, professional  integrity, and  fair  play. The Journal is unique in many ways, and  has made its mark in the policymaking world  and global academy.  Dr. Stavrou ensured that thinkers from all littoral states as well as academic experts in the  U.S. have an open and uncensored forum to  present  and  debate  ideas. Mediterranean  Quarterly has no agenda  to promote other  than the search for truth without fear or favor.  But more importantly, it has made a point to  open its pages to prominent African leaders to  address issues in true Mediterranean spirit of  respect for human dignity.  Over the years, I had the privilege of joining  a  stellar  list of  contributors, among  them  former President Jimmy Carter,  former UN  Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghalli, the  Presidents of Turkey and Croatia, President  Salva Kiir of South Sudan, and a long list of  academics, foreign ministers, prime ministers  and prominent diplomats.  I consider it my distinct honor to have published on a wide range of issues, including Africa, the Cyprus crisis and other issues. The  Mediterranean Quarterly is a forum for thinkers and not a place for waging an ideological  campaign.  f  HONORING THE REVEREND  JOSEPH E. LOWERY  HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND  OFLOUISIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  ",2011
791,135,2011-10-06,Mr. RICHMOND.," Mr. Speaker,  the Reverend Joseph E. Lowery, an irreplaceable organizer  in  the American Civil Rights Movement and a leader who marched with Rev. Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr. to overturn discrimination in voting rights and other injustices, celebrates his 90th birthday today. It is only right  that I honor this man who made my ascension  possible.  Just 54 years ago, in a meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, Rev. Lowery helped form the  Southern Christian  Leadership Conference  alongside Dr. King, Rev. Ralph Abernathy,  and New Orleans’ own Rev. Dr. Simmie Lee  Harvey and Rev. Abraham Lincoln  ‘‘A. L.’’  Davis—among other civil rights leaders. The  Southern Christian  Leadership Conference,  known as the SCLC, was largely known for its  non-violent protests. It was Rev. Lowery himself who organized the 1965 Selma to Montgomery March that eventually led to the passage of the historic Voting Rights Act. You’ll  remember  that  the Voting Rights Act  finally  guaranteed Black Americans  the  right  to  vote—free  from  intimidation, poll  taxes, and  other rules and  laws designed  to disenfranchise us. Rev. Lowery served as the president  of the SCLC from 1977–1997 and revitalized  it  through his outspoken nature and distinct  leadership style.  Rev. Lowery continues to fight social injustice even today at the young age of 90. For  his work, he’s received numerous awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the  nation’s highest civilian honor;  the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s Phoenix  Award; the Martin Luther King Center Peace  Award;  the NAACP  Lifetime Achievement  Award; and the Fred L. Shuttlesworth Human  Rights  Award  from  the  Birmingham Civil  Rights  Institute. Rev. Lowery has also  received several honorary doctorates from colleges and universities including, Dillard University, Morehouse College, Alabama State University, University of Alabama  in Huntsville,  and Emory University.  While delivering the benediction at the 2009  presidential inauguration of President Obama,  Rev. Lowery reminded us all ‘‘that in the complex arena of human relationships, we should  make choices on the side of love, not hate; on  the side of inclusion, not exclusion; and tolerance, not intolerance.’’ It is evident that this  principle has been a driving  force  in every  area of Rev. Lowery’s  life  for  the  last 90  years. His unwavering dedication  to equality  for all people has made this country a better  place for people of all races and ethnicities.  As we celebrate  the  life of Rev. Lowery  today, we must also pause to remember the  legacy of another civil rights leader, Rev. Fred  Shuttlesworth. Rev. Shuttlesworth died yesterday at the age of 89 after fighting for racial  equality alongside Rev. Lowery for more than  50 years. He was an American hero whose  fight for civil rights is emblematic of the perseverance, compassion, and faith that make us  American. He was a legend during the movement and time has only cemented his place in  history as a champion of equality. He was  beaten,  threatened, and his  family was attacked. Nonetheless, he never wavered from  his commitment  to American civil rights. My  achievements have been possible because I  stand on his shoulders, Rev. Lowery’s shoulders, and those of other freedom fighters. Dr.  King once referred to Rev. Shuttlesworth as  ‘‘one of the nation’s most courageous freedom  fighters.’’ It is because of this courage that his  legacy will  live on  for many generations  to  come.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join  me in wishing Rev. Joseph Lowery a happy  and blessed 90th birthday. As Rev. Lowery  once wrote of Dr. King, ‘‘To appropriately celebrate . . . we must honor both the man and  the movement. To ennoble the man and ignore the movement is to do injustice to both.  We must not let the spirit of the movement be  overcome with sentimental ceremonies  that  omit  the sacramental nature of  the struggle.  Ceremonies end with  the benediction while  sacraments begin with the benediction. Ceremony is like putting a ring on her finger at the  wedding. Sacrament  is  ringing her  life with  love and joy ever after.’’  f  CONGRATULATIONS TO BEN AND  JENNIFER MOORE FOR WINNING  TENNESSEE  FARM  BUREAU’S  OUTSTANDING YOUNG  FARMER  ACHIEVEMENT AWARD  HON. STEPHEN LEE FINCHER  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  ",2011
792,135,2011-10-06,Mr. FINCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Ben and Jennifer Moore from the  city of Dresden in Weakley County on winning  the Tennessee Farm Bureau’s Outstanding  Young Farmer and Achievement Award  this  past July 23, 2011. Mr. and Mrs. Moore were  selected over 20 excellent county contestants  to win  the  state  competition and have a  chance to win national honors at the American  Farm Bureau’s convention early next year.  Mr. and Mrs. Moore farm over 3,400 acres  including corn and soybeans and a number of  specialty  crops. Additionally,  they  pasture  about 80 head cow/calf livestock, and manage  a 4,000 sow operation.  Mr. and Mrs. Moore are also active in The  Young Farmers & Ranchers program which  promotes  leadership skills  for  farmers ages  18–35. As members of  the Program  they  share a common bond for the agricultural lifestyle, leadership development, and are dedicated  to meeting  the challenges of  farming  and ranching. Ben served as the YF&R state  committee chairman, was a member of  the  Tennessee Farm Bureau Federation’s Board  of Directors, and has held numerous county  and leadership positions. Jennifer is a member  of the Tennessee Pork Producers Association,  and is active on YF&R committees and other  community organizations. The Moore’s dedication, service, and significant contributions  to  their community and agriculture should make  all Tennesseans proud. Mr. and Mrs. Moore  have three sons, Miller, Tate, and Tyler. I congratulate them all.  f  CELEBRATING  THE  90TH  BIRTHDAY OF REV. JOSEPH LOWERY  HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  ",2011
793,135,2011-10-06,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the birthday of the Reverend Joseph  Lowery, one of the single most important leaders of the modern civil rights movement; and  a close confidant of Dr. Martin Luther King.  Reverend Lowery was born  in Huntsville,  Alabama on October 6th, 1921. He and Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.  formed  the Southern  Leadership Conference, which was the hub of  the civil rights movement in the 1960’s. In addition to being the co-founder of the SLC, Rev.

794,143,2011-10-06,Ms. LINDA T.," SA´NCHEZ of California. Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to recognize October as  National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. To  raise awareness for breast cancer prevention,  I want  to stress  the  importance of  regular  mammograms  and  following  recommended  screening guidelines.  Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed  form of cancer  in women worldwide.  Every two minutes a woman is diagnosed with  breast cancer in the U.S. alone. Every thirteen  minutes, a woman dies of breast  cancer.  While  these statistics are shocking,  there  is  hope.  The 2.5 million breast cancer survivors  in  the U.S. today have shown that early detection and timely treatment are the keys to fighting the disease. The five-year survival rate for  women who are diagnosed at the early stage  of the disease’s development has risen to 98  percent. It is undeniable that early detection  saves lives.  Unfortunately,  despite what we  already  know, the number of women receiving regular  mammograms has declined  in  the past  ten  years. A recent study discovered  that  fewer  than 50 percent of women over the age of 40  with health  insurance had  received a  recommended annual mammogram. This must  change.  In honor of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I want to encourage women to  follow the recommended screening guidelines.  I hope  this message reaches every woman,  and together we can commit to ending breast  cancer forever.  HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. RAZA  DILAWARI  HON. STEVE COHEN  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 6, 2011  ",2011
795,143,2011-10-06,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor the life of Dr. Raza Ali Dilawari, a great  Memphis surgeon known for his work in the  field of oncology. He was born in the Walled  City of Lahore, Pakistan and completed medical school there at King Edward Medical College in 1968. He then completed his surgical  residency at SUNY Upstate Medical Center in  Syracuse, New York and his surgical oncology  fellowship at  the University of Rochester at  Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New  York and the Roswell Park Memorial Institute  in Buffalo, New York. Dr. Dilawari then went  on to spend 35 years in Memphis serving the  community as a doctor, teacher and mentor,  touching thousands of lives in the process.  Dr. Dilawari was appointed Assistant Professor of  the Department of Surgery at  the  University of Tennessee Center  for Health  Sciences in Memphis in 1978. He became the  Assistant Dean  for Clinical Affairs  there as  well as Vice Chairman of the Department of  Surgery at Methodist University Hospital. His  time  in academia  left a great  legacy of research and peer-reviewed publications, but arguably his most  significant  contribution  to  Memphis was his mentoring of medical students and  the  training of over 200 surgical  residents, ensuring his lasting impact and legacy. His focus and dedication to training the  next generation of doctors and surgeons will  have a lasting impact on patients in Memphis  and around the world.  In addition to his great work as a teacher,  Dr. Dilawari opened a surgical oncology practice at the Regional Medical Center and Methodist Central Hospital in Memphis. His surgical  practice allowed him to operate on thousands  of patients over the years, often without regard  to payment. Dr. Dilawari was also very active  in his community as a founding member of the  Al Rasool Center and through his work with  the Islamic Society of Memphis. Dr. Dilawari  was a gracious and kind man who, until the  end of his life, maintained the good nature and  wisdom he had gained from years of treating  cancer patients.  Dr. Raza Dilawari passed away on September 18, 2011, at 64 years of age. The  Memphis community mourns the loss of one  of its great citizens. He is survived by his beloved family: his wife Bushra A. Dilawari, his  five children Asma, Amina, Mariam, Asad and  Saba, his granddaughter Zara as well as a  host of other family and friends across Tennessee and the world. We are grateful to have  had the pleasure of his dedication, skill and  compassion  in  the Memphis community. His  was a life well-lived.  Breast Cancer Awareness Month. This month  we stand together with those who have bravely  faced  this disease, as well as  to  raise  awareness toward finding a cure.  I am proud to wear this pink ribbon pin in  support of National Breast Cancer Awareness  Month and  to  recognize  the  importance of  early detection  in an effort  to eradicate  this  disease,  includin  encouraging women  and  men to follow recommended screening guidelines. Furthermore, we must make certain that  every woman has access to regular mammography screenings.  For more than 20 years, the observance of  National Breast Cancer Awareness Month  each October has provided a time for us all to  reflect on loved ones who have won and lost  the battle against breast cancer.  Every two minutes, a woman is diagnosed  with breast cancer, and every thirteen minutes  one woman will die of breast cancer  in  the  United States. In Florida alone, an estimated  15,330 new cases of invasive breast cancer  will be diagnosed in women in 2011 and 2,690  of  these women will die  from  this disease.  These statistics are some of  the many reasons I am a supporter of legislation and action  that aids the fight to end breast cancer. I have  also signed the National Breast Cancer Coalition’s Congressional Declaration of Support for  Breast Cancer Deadline 2020. By declaring  my support to end breast cancer by January  1, 2020, I am proud to commit to continuing to  educate myself and my constituents about the  issues surrounding breast cancer.  Unfortunately,  today we see a decline  in  screening rates. A recent study of 1.5 million  women  found  that of  those over  the age of  forty, with health insurance, less than fifty percent had received  the recommended annual  screening. The key to ending this disease is  early detection, which reduces costs associated with  the disease. The costs  for early  stage  treatment are estimated at approximately $22,350 per person, while late stage  treatment costs nearly $120,000 per person.  Early detection of this life threatening disease  is crucial  to saving  lives and ultimately  reduces the burden on patients and our health  system.  There are 2.5 million breast cancer survivors living in the U.S. today. They are the  embodiment of bravery, as well as to the importance of promoting awareness about breast  cancer, following recommended guidelines, offering  treatment  to  those affected, and continuing to fund groundbreaking research.  Mr. Speaker, I commend those advocates,  survivors, and men and women who fight the  disease every single day. In honor of National  Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I encourage  everyone to make a renewed commitment to  following  recommended screening guidelines  and I will continue the effort here in Congress  to  eradicate  breast  cancer  by  supporting  breast health awareness, education, research,  screening and referrals.  f  f  RECOGNIZING NATIONAL BREAST  CANCER AWARENESS MONTH  CELEBRATING  THE  DEDICATION  OF THE JEWISH CHAPLAINS MEMORIAL  HON.

798,7,2011-11-10,Mr. BARRASSO.," Mr. President,  I  come to the floor today to talk about  the Environmental Protection Agency,  the EPA, and their  implementing a  cap-and-trade  program  for what  is  called cross-State air pollution. I oppose this new regulation and I support  the resolution of disapproval that we  will be voting on later today.  Led by the EPA, Washington bureaucrats are tying up America with redtape. They are tying up our Nation and  they are tying up the American people.  This year alone, the EPA has issued  over 400  final rules. These are rules  that do have the effect of law. Well,  that is over two rules per day so far  this year for each day the Federal Register has been open for business in 2011.  Imagine any business in the United  States,  in our home  communities—  businesses having to comply with two  new EPA rules each day you are open  for business. And, of course,  if you  don’t comply, then you face thousands  of dollars in fines. This is business as  usual for the EPA. Thousands of rules  are filling the Federal Register, 70,000  pages this year alone. The costs of  rules issued this year are estimated to  eclipse the $100 billion mark. It is time  to stop Washington bureaucrats. They  are issuing excessive rules without considering their impact on our economy.  The problem is that this administration does not believe there is a regulations problem. They think more regulations actually create jobs rather than  harm  jobs. Fortunately,  a  previous  Congress passed, and President Clinton  signed into law, what is called the Congressional Review Act. This law gives  us our best tool to dismantle bad regulations, and we should use it when appropriate.  Majority Leader REID, one of the authors of this Congressional Review Act,  described the process as a reasonable,  sensible approach to regulatory reform.  I believe the Senate should use it here  today. The Senate should take back  some responsibility, instead of letting  unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats  continue to harm our economy.  I am standing here today to support  Senator RANDPAUL’s resolution to nullify the EPA’s cross-State air pollution  rule. The EPA’s cross-State air pollution rule was finalized approximately 3  months  ago.  It  is  already  costing  Americans jobs. Over the summer, officials at a Texas utility threw up their  hands and  said  they  can’t  comply.  They said it was too costly, too burdensome, and 500 jobs in Texas were  lost as a result. The EPA’s own estimates say another 2,500 jobs will be  lost because of this very regulation.  Private sector analysis puts the  job  and cost numbers much higher.  The cross-State air pollution  rule  puts  limits on electricity generation  for over half the country.  It  forces  Washington’s heavy hand on over 1,000  coal, gas, and oil-fired facilities across  28  States.  Originally  designed  for  States in the East, the EPA now continues to expand the rule to capture  more and more States in the West. The  newest version of the rule imposes new  requirements  for Kansas, Oklahoma,  Nebraska, Texas, Iowa, Missouri, and  Wisconsin. The compliance costs are  very high. By the EPA’s own estimate,  the rule will cost over $2.4 billion.  The EPA also notes that part of these  costs will be passed on to U.S. households in the form of higher electricity  rates. The  cross-State air pollution  rule  demonstrates  how  bureaucrats  simply do not understand how job creators work and operate  their businesses all across this country.  The  implementation  timeline  the  EPA has proposed is nearly impossible  to follow. The rule was finalized on August 8, which leaves less than 6 months  for companies and States to act and  meet the new mandates by January of  2012. The Office of Management and  Budget even warned that there would  be  consequences  of  such  a  drastic  change in such a short amount of time.  In conclusion, this resolution of disapproval will tell the bureaucrats to do  their job but do it following the rules  of the road. We all want clean air, and  we want it done in a responsible way.  This EPA  is  rushing  through  rules,  causing a train wreck in our economy,  our jobs, and our competitiveness as a  nation will suffer as a result. Senator  PAUL’s resolution will save at  least  3,000 American jobs and also prevent a  rise in electricity costs for American  families. By adopting this resolution  today, we will help our job creators,  and help them be more competitive in  the global marketplace. It is common  sense to rein in the EPA.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.  ",2011
799,7,2011-11-10,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, I have  great respect for my colleague who just  spoke but disagree with him, and I urge  my colleagues to take a careful look at  the Rand  Paul  resolution  of  disapproval when it comes to this issue of  air pollution. I would commend the remarks of our colleague Senator KELLY  AYOTTEof New Hampshire who spoke  this Tuesday on the floor of the Senate, urging  the  same opposition  to  RANDPAUL’s resolution. She said she  could not support that resolution. I  quote  from Senator AYOTTE’s  floor  statement:  The cross-State air pollution rule is designed to control emissions of air pollution  that cause air quality problems in downwind  States, and New Hampshire is a downwind  State.  PAUL She went on to argue that this rule,  which was first implemented 6 years  ago—this  is not a new  idea coming  through  this administration;  it has  been here for years—is simple justice.  Why in the world should the people  downwind of a polluting State have  their lifestyle and opportunity to expand businesses affected? Shouldn’t we  have reasonable standards that, if the  air pollution you put in the air is going  to cross over the border—which it naturally will—and affect the air quality  in a neighboring State, you have a responsibility? Well, of course you do.  But, unfortunately, the position Senator  is  taking  is  that  we  shouldn’t  have  any  standards,  we  shouldn’t have any rules.  I would also suggest that there are  utility companies—one that visited my  offices yesterday—that agree with my  position. They want to have a good  rule when it comes to this cross-State  air pollution.  John Rowe is the executive of a company named Exelon. Exelon, Commonwealth Edison, has been around for a  number of years. They have acquired  plants in many different locations. He  was here on the Hill yesterday as a  utility  executive  lobbying  against  RANDPAUL’s resolution of disapproval.  If you believe the earlier statements  made by my colleague and friend Senator BARRASSO, you would assume the  power industry is opposed to the EPA  in this position. Not true. Many forward-looking utility executives have  made decisions to lessen air pollution.  If the Paul resolution is enacted, all of  their  investment will have been  for  nothing other than their own self-satisfaction. They have tried to live up to a  standard  in  the  law which Senator  PAULnow wants to eliminate. That is a  mistake. And it is a mistake because it  rewards bad conduct.  When we come up with new standards  to make America healthier and safer,  it is interesting, the reaction. Some  corporate leaders, when they hear of a  new standard that might make the air  cleaner or water purer, say, That is it,  we have heard from the government,  we have got to go out and hire a lawyer  and a lobbyist to fight it. Others say,  That is it, we believe the standard is  reasonable, we are going to hire the engineers to make it work.  The second approach is one we should  reward. The first approach will be rewarded if Senator PAUL has his way  and eliminates this air pollution standard.  Yesterday, Lisa Jackson, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, came in my office and I  talked to her. I said that many times  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:25 Jul 20, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S10NO1.REC S10NO1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

803,15,2011-11-10,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to support the cross-State  air pollution rule that protects downwind eastern States such as New Jersey  from upwind power pollution plants’  dirty air, and I rise in defense of the  lives and the breathable air of the people of New Jersey, all 9 million plus.  Last week I asked the Governor of  my State to join this fight. After all,  this rule is supported by the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce and our  largest utility, because it is good for  business. They know it is only fair to  level the playing field for New Jersey  businesses, since we have already substantially cleaned up our electric generation facilities. We are meeting our  obligations.  The rule is supported by just about  everyone in the public health community because it will save an estimated  1,200 lives per year in New Jersey beginning in 2014. Nationally, it will save  up to 34,000 lives, prevent 400,000 asthma attacks, and avoid 1.8 million lost  sick days per year starting in 2014.  The economic benefits of this rule  are estimated to reach anywhere from  $120 billion to $280 billion each year.  We are all focused like a laser beam on  the economy, as we should be, on jobs  and their creation, as we should be, on  reducing deficits and  looking at the  bottom line. But this rule does not create or force a choice between trying to  grow this economy, creating jobs, and  reducing deficits. It is a good rule for  the economy. It is a good rule for the  health and well-being of Americans,  particularly those downwind from the  toxic emissions of powerplants.  Let’s be clear. Corporate coal powerplants enjoy an enormous subsidy that  we are trying to repeal with this rule.  Those polluters can prematurely end  34,000 lives per year and not have to  pay anything for that loss, not have to  pay anything for the health care costs  of all of those who are afflicted at the  end of the day by this dirty air. But yet  that cost is borne by all of us at the  end of the day. To put 34,000 lives in  perspective, that  is almost as many  American  lives  as  are  claimed  by  breast cancer every year. So I ask my  colleagues to join with me and others  in voting against the Paul resolution.  It is a vote for saving 34,000 lives per  year. There are  few  times  in  this  Chamber where you can actually cast a  vote that will save a life. This is one of  those moments.  Vote for over $120 billion in economic  benefits. Vote for cleaner air. Let us  bequeath  to  future  generations  of  Americans not air in our Nation that is  dirty but air that is cleaner. Vote for  keeping  our  children  healthy. You  know, the number of asthma attacks  growing in this country is enormous.  Certainly  in my  home State,  respiratory ailments are on the rise. The  last thing we need to do is to nullify  the ability to create cleaner air at the  end of the day. It is time for us to all  see  this as an opportunity  to ultimately make a difference. It is a time  for us all to see this disapproval resolution for what it is, a path for polluting  industries that make us sick without  paying for the cost it creates.

804,15,2011-11-10,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, there was  a time when strong bipartisan majorities in Congress sided with the interests and views of the American people  about curbing pollution to safeguard  the  public’s  right  to  a  clean  and  healthy environment. Citizens placed  their trust in the government to act on  their  behalf,  to  set  science-based  health standards to protect the air we  breathe. On both sides of the aisle,  there was an understanding  that a  healthy environment was critical to  our families, our livelihoods, our economy, and our Nation. To improve the  Nation’s air quality, Congress almost  unanimously passed the Clean Air Act  in 1970, under President Richard Nixon.  Congress then passed the 1990 Clean Air  Act Amendments,  again with  overwhelming majorities in both Chambers,  under President George H.W. Bush.  As part of the 1990 Amendments, Congress specifically required the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to address emissions that interfere with another State’s ability to protect public  health  through  air  quality  requirements. Yet today we still lack the appropriate pollution limits necessary to  protect each and every American from  drifting smog and soot pollutants, and  to protect States  from bearing  the  health and economic costs of distant  polluters who are far beyond their purview. With the cross-State air pollution rule, the EPA  is doing exactly  what we in Congress asked them to do.  This is also exactly what the courts  told them to do, and exactly what they  should do to protect the American public from the hundreds of thousands of  tons of pollutants emitted each year  from coal-fired powerplants.  These pollutants all too often reach  unsafe levels, resulting in air quality  alerts  and  dangerous  health  consequences—all the more so for young  children, the elderly, and those who already have respiratory problems. My  own wife Marcelle is a nurse, and she  knows from experience how harmful air  pollution can be  in contributing  to  asthma, bronchitis, heart attacks, and  even death.  This cross-State rule will protect the  American people  from dangerous air  pollution pumped into our air by the  largest polluters. These are sensible,  workable  limits that would tangibly  improve Americans’  lives. These are  improvements that would foster a better economy by annually preventing up  to 34,000 premature deaths, 15,000 heart  attacks, 19,000 emergency room visits,  400,000 aggravated asthma cases and 1.8  million sick days.  By 2014, in Vermont alone, the health  benefits will add up to $360 million  each year  from these  improvements.  These changes are literally a matter of  life and death for many Americans. For  example,  studies  show  that  in  our  state, curbing smog and soot pollution  will allow 44 Vermonters to celebrate  another birthday and live to see the  next generation of children and grandchildren thrive.  In States  like Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Ohio, and  Pennsylvania, the cross-State rule will  save as many as 1,400 to 3,200 lives each  year. That is a lot of parents, children,  grandparents, aunts, and uncles.  However, S.J. Res. 27 would void the  life-saving,  health-promoting  cross-  State air pollution rule and prohibit  any  future attempt by the EPA to  limit unsafe  levels of air pollutants  that drift across  state boundaries—  making  it one of the all-time most  harmful and egregious attacks on the  Clean Air Act and on the health of the  people we represent. If passed, this resolution would force the EPA to ignore  dangerous, drifting emissions forever,  compelling Americans to accept shorter lives, to accept the risk of heart attacks and strokes, to suffer with asthma and other serious illnesses, and to  accept the degraded quality of the Nation’s parks, waterways, and  forests.  Those are not things that I am willing  to accept and no Member of the Senate  should support.  Powerful special interests and their  allies who want to overturn the cross-  State rule are asking Americans to suffer to save the economy, but their economic arguments fall flat in the face of  the evidence. The truth is, nothing will  sink the economy more than degrading  our  environment and poisoning our  workforce. Pollution regulations help  to lower health care costs, maintain  worker productivity, and support local  economies through recreational industries. The cross-State rule will have  national benefits of up to $280 billion  annually. This dwarfs the annual compliance costs of about $800 million in  2014, which helps explain why most  Americans believe  that health-based  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:25 Jul 20, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S10NO1.REC S10NO1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011
805,23,2011-11-10,Mr. LEVIN.," Madam President, I will  oppose the motion to proceed to S.J.  Res. 6 a joint resolution of disapproval  of the FCC rule regarding net neutrality.  This resolution of disapproval would  overturn the FCC’s rule that would  codify and supplement existing Internet openness principles while maintaining the ability of Internet service  providers to engage in reasonable network management. The  rules would  prohibit Internet access providers from  preventing its users from sending or receiving lawful content over the Internet; prohibit Internet access providers  from preventing users from connecting  lawful devices  to  the network; and  would require Internet access providers  to treat lawful content, applications,  and  services  in a nondiscriminatory  manner.  It also  included additional  provisions that will create an Open  Internet Advisory Committee to assess  and report to the FCC on developments  in mobile broadband.  The Internet has become an indispensable tool that has spurred innovation,  provided virtually unlimited access to  information and  commerce, and  increased communication through Web  sites, e-mail, and blogs. It has become  difficult to imagine life without the  Internet, a system both open and unrestricted.  The Internet plays a critical role in  our  society  because  it provides  an  equal platform for all users, allowing  for the free exchange of ideas and information. It is important that the Internet remain free and open and not risk  becoming a system with limited access  for some of the smaller Web sites and  their users.  ",2011
806,23,2011-11-10,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Madam President,  over the past 20 years, the Internet has  grown and flourished without burdensome  regulations  from Washington.  With the strength of free market forces  behind  it, the Internet has been an  open platform for innovation. It has  spurred business development, much  needed job creation, millions of jobs in  fact. If we are going to keep an open  and free Internet and keep the jobs it  spawns, we should reject the FCC regulation on net neutrality.  The  FCC  reversed  its  successful  hands-off approach last December by  passing net neutrality rules where the  FCC  has  essentially  granted  itself  power over all forms of communication, including the Internet. Congress  did not explicitly delegate this authority to the FCC, and it is our responsibility to hold on to the power that only  we authorize regulations where they  are needed. Unelected agencies do not  get to decide on their own that something needs to be done that Congress  has not, in its congressional and constitutional  responsibility, decided  is  necessary.  These regulations on broadband providers establish the FCC as the Internet’s gatekeeper—a role for which government is not really suited when innovation  could  be  stifled.  Instead  of  spending their resources on new job-  creating investments, on new products,  on new services, Internet providers are  going to have to spend money on lawyers and lobbyists to comply with and  go through the processes the FCC will  require. Congress has never given the  FCC this authority.  Regulators  and  bureaucrats  all  across the government are overstepping their bounds in many areas—the  NMB, the NLRB, the EPA—and it is  time for Congress to push back, and we  can do it today. Regulators should not  regulate without the explicit authority  of Congress. The court said so in the  Comcast case.  ",2011

820,47,2011-11-10,Mr. BARRASSO.," We  have  talked  about this. There is a program that his  patients and mine have enjoyed, called  Medicare Advantage, and there is an  advantage for patients signing up for  that program. About one in four Americans on Medicare signs up for Medicare Advantage. The advantages of this  program are that it coordinates care,  works with preventive care. Yet, the  President has targeted that for elimination. By 2017, half of the people on  this program, who say they like and  have it, will no longer be eligible to  participate in it because of this health  care law. We explain that to the American people in our second opinion on  ‘‘Medicare and You.’’  Finally, Dr. COBURNtalked about the  IPAB, the Independent Payment Board.  It is a rationing board to me, a board  designed to deny and refuse care. These  are unelected bureaucrats. They don’t  need to have a medical background or  don’t necessarily need to see patients.  It is specifically related to cutting the  amount of money that is paid for patients to have procedures, to see physicians, and to get the care they need,  which is why there is great concern  throughout this country and why the  President’s health care  law becomes  more unpopular every day.

The No. 1 reason  survival rates from cancer in England  are lower is because treatments are denied by their IPAB for the best treatments, which will save more people’s  lives at the best price. That is something that should not be discounted.  I yield the floor.  ",2011

824,47,2011-11-10,Mr. HARKIN.," Madam President,  I  would like to take this opportunity to  talk about a bipartisan bill that was  recently passed out of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee,  the HELP Committee, which I chair  and of which Senator MIKEENZIof Wyoming is the ranking member. This bipartisan bill reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of  1965  and would  replace  its  current  iteration, which everyone knows by the  title of ‘‘No Child Left Behind.’’ I want  to start with a few words about the  Federal role in education in this country since ESEA is a key part of that  role.  While it is certainly true education is  primarily a State and local function,  the Federal Government does play an  important  role, and a well-educated  citizenry is clearly in the national interest. A central Federal role is to ensure all Americans, regardless of race,  gender, national origin, religion, or disability, have the same equal opportunity  to a good education as any  other American citizen.  Likewise, the Constitution expressly  states that our National Government  was  formed specifically to  ‘‘promote  the general welfare, and  secure  the  blessings of liberty.’’ The general welfare,  I submit,  is greatly  in danger  when the populace is not adequately  educated, and education is critical to  liberty. As Frederick Douglass so eloquently  noted,  education  ‘‘means  emancipation. It means light and liberty.’’  It is no surprise that the Northwest  Ordinance of 1787 expressly stated that  ‘‘schools and the means of education  shall be forever encouraged.’’ That law  encouraged new territories to establish  schools.  The Federal Government also encouraged States to establish public colleges  and universities through the Morrill  Act of 1862, which started the whole  land grant college movement.  Moving  into the 20th century, the  Servicemen’s  Readjustment  Act,  known as the GI bill, provided grants  to World War II veterans to pursue a  college education.  In 1954, the Supreme Court struck  down laws endorsing racial segregation  in public schools.  In 1958, Congress authorized the National Defense Education Act, the first  Federal loan program to students for  higher education. That was one I borrowed money from when I went to Iowa  State University.  That was followed by the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the Federal Pell  grants enacted in 1972.  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed in 1965 and provided aid to States and school districts  to improve education for children from  low-income families.  In  1975, Congress passed  the Education  for All Handicapped Children  Act, which later became the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,  which was to assist States and districts  in educating children with disabilities.  In 1994, Congress passed the Goals  2000: Educate America Act and the Improving America’s Schools Act.  In 2001, Congress passed the No Child  Left Behind Act, which went even further in terms of what was required of  schools to receive Federal funds.  I go through all this so you can see  that  the Federal  role  in  education  spans over 200 years, and its primary  objective has always been to increase  educational  opportunity  and  to  enhance  educational  attainment. This  context is important to any discussion  about the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  The original goal of ESEA was to  provide resources to the schools with  the most disadvantaged students. This  funding was  needed  because many  States  and  districts  use  education  funding formulas that provide fewer resources to high-poverty schools. Again,  when anyone wants to talk about this,  I  say  go  back  and  read Jonathan  Kozol’s book entitled ‘‘Savage Inequalities,’’ written  in  the mid-1980s,  in  which he pointed out the gross inequality in our schools in America depending upon your ZIP Code—depending  upon where you lived. We knew from  that time that educating poor students  actually requires more resources, not  fewer, and title I was our attempt to  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:25 Jul 20, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S10NO1.REC S10NO1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011

826,55,2011-11-10,Ms. CANTWELL.," Mr. President,  I  thank my colleague, the senior Senator  from Maryland, for her leadership on  this issue for protecting seniors and  protecting women.  It  seems  to me  every time we have a battle that is  about  undercutting  the  benefits  to  women in America, BARBARAMIKULSKI  is on the Senate floor or in the halls  and in various meeting rooms making  sure that America knows what these  proposals are.  I could not have been more proud of  her when she led all the women Senators on the Democratic side of the  aisle to push back on the Bush Administration’s proposal to privatize Social  Security. At that point in time, she  most succinctly told Americans that  women, more than any other in that  age group, would suffer because they  live longer, they depend on Social Security,  and  if Social Security was  privatized, women would feel the brunt  of it.  So I am proud to be out here this  afternoon with her to talk about this  proposal that has been—we cannot tell,  because we do not know. We are not on  the supercommittee. But it seems to be  floating around in various forms, various  organizations may  be  talking  about  it, the notion that we would  change Social Security.  I know at home in my State of Washington, people  seem  to be confused  when we are talking about our budgets.  And we are obviously having to make  tough budget decisions, as are people  around dining room tables, around city  halls, around our State capitols and  here in Congress are having discussions  about how to have a budget to live  within our means.  But when you talk to them about the  primary way—and one proposal that  surfaced  in the  last budget negotiations  in July was  to automatically  take $300 billion of cuts right off the  top as the major proposal out of a concept called chained CPI. When you  think about  that,  the  first  shot of  budget cuts would be on the backs of  seniors,  it  is almost as  if  someone  thought seniors cooked up exotic financial instruments and foisted them on  the U.S. economy and somehow they  should pay the price. We know that is  not the case.  So why are people targeting these  seniors now? And we are not sure if  they are. We have just heard various  rumors  that perhaps  this notion of  chained CPI, a change in Social Security benefits as my colleague just outlined, would be a proposal.  I am here to say, I am not for having  the seniors in America share the brunt  of sacrifice with a proposal such as this  that would clearly be on the backs of  seniors. It is not something they can  afford. I know some of my colleagues  may have endorsed a chained CPI, a  change in the consumer price index to  calculate inflation. But that is a cut  that would increase over time. And literally, the longer you live, the more  you are penalized. It  is such a disproportionate impact to women who do  live  longer than men and count on  those benefits for their living.  In my State, changes to the cost-of-  living adjustment would hurt more  than 1 million Washingtonians. Social  Security has kept about 30 percent of  Washington residents who are 65 and  older out of poverty. That is what it  has done for them. And what is more,  25 percent of seniors in my State live  on Social Security alone. So there is a  population that is depending on Social  Security, and they are  living on  it  alone, or it is making up—another 21  percent of them—it makes up 90 percent of their income.  I think this demonstrates that we  cannot support these kinds of cuts, especially at the magnitude this proposal  is talking about. The Social Security  Office of the Actuary has reported that  chained CPI would reduce the COLA by  about .3 percent a year. So let’s look at  that example. A single woman, 65 years  old in Washington State, would get a  monthly  benefit  of  about  $1,100  a  month or $13,300 annually.  By age 80, if chained CPI would pass,  that would result in a $56 per month or  $672 annual cut in that benefit. So that  is less food, that is less medicine, that  is less vital care for these seniors. If  that  individual actually  lived  to  90  years old, it would be an $87 a month  cut and a $1,044 cut annually. If you  think about the costs these seniors endure—and  I  for  one have  proposed  changing the market basket of goods  that the CPI is based on, because if you  think about it, we have a market basket of goods  for their CPI that are  what the overall economy looks at.  But seniors have a much more expensive market basket of goods. They have  to buy more medicine. They have other  additional out-of-pocket health  care  expenses. And so their costs are going  up at a higher rate. But this proposal,  if you  think about  it,  the average  monthly cost of food for a single elderly individual is about $231 per month.  That is what the average is, about $53  a week. That is based on data from the  Elder  Economic  Security  Standard  Index. So an individual at 80 basically  means they would have 1 week less groceries under chained CPI.  That is what it means. They would  have 1 week  left of groceries every  month.  In my State, when you think about  the average out-of-pocket health care  VerDate Mar 15 2010  00:25 Jul 20, 2012 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\S10NO1.REC S10NO1 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o l a e n b j         ",2011
827,63,2011-11-10,Mr. MORAN.," Mr. President, I wish to  recognize  and  pay  tribute  to CPL  Vollie  Pitts  of  Hutchinson,  KS.  Corpora1 Pitts  proudly  served  our  country in World War I and has been  revered as a hero by his family, friends,  and those who served alongside him.  Today it is my privilege to share the  story of this unsung hero and honor  him for his service and sacrifice on behalf of our country.  Corporal Pitts was born on February  14, 1897, and raised on his family’s farm  in Salina, KS. Like so many Kansans of  his generation, Corporal Pitts put his  country’s needs before his own, leaving  his parents and three siblings behind to  volunteer as a member of the Kansas  National Guard. At the young age of 19,  he was first called into duty when his  regiment was mobilized to the Mexican  border in 1916. Their mission was to  protect Americans from Mexican outlaws who were operating along the U.S.  border. Following the successful completion of their mission, his regiment  joined with another and became the  137th Kansas Infantry Regiment.  Corporal Pitts was again called into  duty  in 1917 to serve his county  in  World War I. In the spring of 1918, Corporal Pitts and his  regiment made  their way to the frontlines for one of  the most  significant battles of  the  First World War—the Battle of the Argonne Forest. It was during this battle  when  Corporal  Pitts  courageously  rushed a German gun emplacement,  single-handedly capturing the gun and  part of its crew. His heroic actions that  day saved countless lives, including the  men of his own unit. Even after he was  wounded and gassed, Corporal Pitts  continued to fight until he was forced  to seek help at a field hospital, where  doctors determined his fighting days  had come to an end.  Upon his arrival back in the United  States, Corporal Pitts received an honorable discharge from the service and  returned home  to Kansas. On September 2, 1920, he began a new chapter  in  his  life  and  married  Gladys  Reichardt. The young  couple made  their home in Hutchinson, Kansas and  raised two daughters, Koloma and Patricia. Several decades  later  in 1954,  Corporal Pitts passed away in Denver,  CO, surrounded by his family.  Corporal  Pitts  exemplified many  traits we can all admire: courage, dedication, and selflessness. His heroic actions during World War I will forever  remain a testimony to his love for this  country  and  his  fellow Americans.  America is proud and honored to call  Corporal Pitts one of our own, and we  shall never forget his courage and sacrifice, which made America a stronger  and freer nation.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.  f  EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED  As in executive session the Presiding  Officer laid before the Senate messages  from  the President  of  the United  States submitting sundry nominations  and a withdrawal which were referred  to the appropriate committees.

I want to thank my colleague  Senator JAMES INHOFE from Oklahoma  for joining me on this effort. I also  commend the Chair of the House Foreign Affairs’ Committee—and  fellow  Floridian Congresswoman ILEANAROS-  LEHTINEN for leading on this effort in  the House of Representatives.  The United Nations was created in  1945 with the specific mandate of maintaining the hard-fought peace that followed the end of World War II. Just as  it was then, today our nation’s security  and prosperity  is  influenced by conflicts and events taking place in various near and  far-flung places. The  United States cannot and should not  attempt to address these conflicts on  its own. More than six decades later,  we still need a U.N. with resolve, a U.N.  that acts with effectiveness and purpose. Sadly, the U.N.’s persistent ethics and accountability problems are  limiting its role. Until the organization addresses these important issues,  the stature of the organization will  continue to suffer in the eyes of the  world.  Examples of this troubling situation  abound, from the ongoing efforts to circumvent direct negotiations to end the  Israeli-Arab conflict, to the discredited  Human Rights Council  led  by  the  world’s most notorious  tyrants and  human rights violators, to the proliferation  of mandates  that  have  clouded the organization’s mission and  effectiveness.  My hope with this legislation is to  provide an incentive for the United Nations and the President, to modernize  that international body along a spirit  of  transparency,  respect  for  basic  human  freedoms, and effective nonproliferation. This  legislation would  also attempt to address the anti-Semitic attitudes that have become so  prevalent in certain corners of the U.N.  and seriously diminish the credibility  of the entire U.N. system.  At the core of these reforms is an effort to instill a sense of transparency  and competition at the U.N. by  its  adoption of a budgetary model that relies mostly on voluntary contributions.  This legislation would also strengthen  the  international standing of human  rights by reforming the U.N. Human  Rights Council in a way that it would  deny membership  to nations under  U.N. sanctions, designated by our Department of State as States Sponsors  of Terrorism, or failing to take measures to combat and end the despicable  practice of human trafficking. Other  provisions seek meaningful reforms at  the U.N. Relief and Work Agency that  provides assistance to Palestinian refugees of the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict.  This legislation is needed because the  structure and bureaucratic culture of  the organization often makes it impossible or, at best, downright difficult to  achieve meaningful reforms. It follows  on the steps of previously successful  Congressional initiatives on this matter. Every previously successful American effort for reform at the U.N. has  been accompanied with the threat of  withholding  our  valuable  contributions. I wish this wasn’t the case, but  this is the record, so it is part of our  legislation.  In closing, the United Nations has  served  as  the  primary multilateral  forum to address peace and security  issues throughout the world, and I look  forward to working with my Senate  colleagues  in  achieving meaningful  transparency  and  accountability  reforms at that international body.  By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr.  CASEY, Mr. TESTER, Mr. BROWN  of  Ohio,  Mr.  Mr.  FRANKEN, Mr. BINGAMAN, Ms.  of  Mrs.  KLOBUCHAR, Mr.  JOHNSON LEAHY,  and  Dakota,  South  BOXER):  S. 1850. A bill to expand and improve  opportunities  for  beginning  farmers  and ranchers, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.  ",2011
829,71,2011-11-10,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, among  the most hopeful occurrences in rural  America is when someone is able to get  started in farming or ranching and go  on  to build a  successful operation.  Typically,  the  beginning  farmer  or  rancher  is continuing an established  family  farm or  ranch, although  increasingly he or she is taking on the  challenge of starting and growing an  entirely new operation.  Because farming and ranching families are so vital to rural communities  and our Nation as a whole, there has  been a great deal of concern for decades as America’s agricultural producers have grown older and retired, as  farm numbers  fell, and as men and  women who had a great desire to become the next generation of farmers  and ranchers were unable to find the  opportunities and resources to do so.  Across America, we are fortunate to  have many  families and  individuals  who possess the ability, motivation,  and dedication to start or continue a  farm or ranch and build a rewarding  life in agriculture. Our Nation needs  more beginning farmers and ranchers  across all types of operations—including commercial-scale crop and animal  agriculture  systems,  organic  agriculture, growing for local food systems  and farmers markets, and even farming  in urban and suburban areas. We need  more beginning farmers and ranchers  to secure critical supplies of food, fuel,  and fiber for the future. We need them  as stewards to care for and conserve  our soil, water, and other natural resources. We need more new  farming  and ranching families as contributing  members of healthy and vibrant local  communities.  Aspiring and beginning farmers and  ranchers  confront  tremendous  challenges, yet  there are  some hopeful  signs. According to the Census of Agriculture, the number of farms in the  United States increased four percent  between 2002 and 2007. The new farms  tended to be smaller, have lower sales,  and  rely more  on  off-farm  income  sources. New farmers are also more diverse, with  significant  increases between 2002 and 2007 in the number of  farm operators who are women, Hispanic, American Indian, African-American, and Asian-American.  We know from experience that carefully designed programs can very effectively  help  beginning  farmers  and  ranchers apply their talents and efforts,  assemble  the  necessary  resources, capitalize upon opportunities,  and succeed. I am proud that in the  two farm bills, in 2002 and 2008, that we  enacted while I was chairman of the  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry  Committee, we adopted a number of  initiatives to strengthen and improve  programs at the Department of Agriculture that assist beginning farmers  and ranchers.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  today, joined by a number of my colleagues, is crafted to extend, improve,  and strengthen beginning farmer and  rancher programs and initiatives that  we adopted  in the most recent two  farm bills and in earlier farm bills and  other legislation. The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity Act of 2011  will build upon the successful record of  the earlier legislation and its implementation by the U.S. Department of  Agriculture in cooperation with a variety of public and private institutions  and organizations.  Let me emphasize that the beginning  farmer and rancher initiatives in the  legislation we are introducing today,  and the programs now being carried  out by USDA, are not designed or intended to guarantee the success of any  beginning farmer or rancher or to give  anyone something for nothing. All they  do is to offer a helping hand, a better  opportunity, to women and men who  make the effort and apply themselves,  who are willing to learn and to do the  necessary work to achieve their goals  and succeed in farming and ranching.  A key feature of the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Opportunity Act of 2011  is to extend and strengthen the beginning farmer and rancher development  program, which we enacted in 2008. In  this program, USDA provides competitively-awarded grants to qualified organizations that deliver training and  education  for beginning  farmers and  ranchers. This new legislation makes it  a new priority  for USDA  to  issue  grants to support agricultural rehabilitation and vocational training for military veterans and to deliver training  and education to help veterans who are  beginning farmers and ranchers.

830,95,2011-11-10,Ms. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor the 65 million Americans who  spend on average 20 hours per week selflessly caring  for  family members or  friends  who, through age, disability, or illness, have  lost the ability to care for themselves.  For most of us, the act of caring for those  in need is a basic aspect of what it means to  be human. Compassion, either through charitable giving or community service, is inseparable from American ideals of human rights for  every member of our society. Whenever we  treat those around us as we want to be treated, we contribute to a culture of responsibility  and respect for life that leads us to do great  things in the name of humanity.  Last week, President Barack Obama proclaimed November 2011 as National Family  Caregivers Month. Anyone who spends time  caring for a loved one in need is considered  a family caregiver. Let us use this occasion to  honor these everyday heroes and raise awareness of the profound contributions they make  to society.  Family caregivers save taxpayers hundreds  of billions of dollars each year through their efforts.  According  to studies compiled by  the National Family Caregivers Association, the value  of the unpaid services provided each year is  estimated to be $375 billion, which is almost  twice as much as  the $158 billion spent  in  2009 on homecare and nursing home services  combined.  In my home state of California alone there  were 3,419,481 family caregivers in 2004 providing over $36 billion worth of care. Though  they are mostly untrained,  family caregivers  now provide about 80% of all long-term care  in the United States.  Imagine if taxpayers had to foot the full bill.  Now, more  than ever,  family caregivers are  essential  to providing  the best services and  deserve  the support of government and  the  medical community.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, the US Census  projects a massive growth in the number of  Americans 65 and older as the baby-boomer  generation  ages. Populations  in  this  age  bracket will double in 23 states by 2030.  As medical progress means  longer  lives,  families struggle  to provide  long-term  family  care than they did in past decades. Families  are smaller and more spread out, and many  family caregivers must juggle work and raising  children in addition to their caregiving responsibilities. Family caregivers may need to operate complex medical equipment or practice  delicate procedures without any formal training.  The  ‘‘graying of America’’ will have a  tremendous impact on families providing care for  their older members.  Many public health officials are concerned  that we may not be ready to assume the roles  of  family  caregivers. Studies  suggest  that  many Americans have not spent much  time  thinking about or preparing for long-term care.  People who have no experience as a family  caregiver may have extreme difficulty  in approaching such a responsibility.  Mr. Speaker, the fact is that most of us will  find ourselves in a similar situation, either giving or  requiring  long  term care at various  points in our lives.  Family caregivers often put themselves second as they balance competing commitments  to their jobs, families, and communities. Tragically, more than 1 in 10 family caregivers report that their physical health has deteriorated  as a result of extreme stress.  Family  caregivers  experiencing  extreme  stress have been shown to age prematurely.  This level of stress can take as much as 10  years off a family caregiver’s life.  Mr. Speaker, 40  to 70 percent of  family  caregivers have clinically significant symptoms  of depression with approximately a quarter to  half of  these caregivers meet  the diagnostic  criteria for major depression.  We must also remember that many disabled  veterans are supported by family caregivers.  Having given so much for their country, I believe  that  they and  their  family members  should not have to struggle to live out a full,  dignified life.  Therefore, we should do everything possible  to support family caregivers and lighten their  burdens.  It begins with encouraging people  to  take  adequate steps  to prepare  for  their  future  care. This means setting aside funds to cover  unforeseen medical expenses, signing a living  will, and making preparations with family and  friends. Health professionals must be sensitive  to  the needs of  family caregivers and enlist  them in formulating a patient’s long-term care  plan.  We also need to make sure that family caregivers have access  to  information and  resources that can help them meet their responsibilities with minimal strain and unnecessary  cost.  Finally, we must ensure that the concerns of  family caregivers are  reflected  in all major  healthcare legislation.  We are all family caregivers, Mr. Speaker. I  urge my colleagues to work together to support human dignity and the American family.

Not a single  Republican  vote.  Once  again,  you  balked when it came time to vote.  ",2011
840,5,2011-11-18,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, I now would  like to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee, Dr. ROE, a  southern gentleman who understands  the rules.  ",2011
841,5,2011-11-18,Mr. ROE of Tennessee.," Dr. FOXX, I  thank you for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this rule and the underlying  bill. Our country is in the middle of a  jobs crisis, no question. Both sides understand that. The national unemployment rate has hovered around 9 percent  for the longest time in my lifetime,  and in Tennessee it’s even higher, 9.8  percent. Millions of American families  are struggling as we speak.  Amidst all of this uncertainty, the  House, with bipartisan  support, has  passed 22 jobs bills. Right down this  hallway here this week the U.S. Senate  worked so hard they voted two times  on two Federal judges. That’s all the  work that took place with 22, many of  them  bipartisan  bills,  passed, Mr.  Speaker.  I think right now we’ve seen in this  country, to hold up jobs, the delay of  the Keystone pipeline, which would essentially, over  time, provide us as  much oil from Canada as we’re getting  from OPEC right now. 1.3 million barrels a day would essentially relieve us  and help our national security and create thousands of jobs.  So why are we here today? What happens currently?  Mr. Speaker, I grew up in a union  household. My  father was  a union  worker at that time  for the United  Rubber Workers Union. He worked in a  factory and he made shoe heels. And  the union, we have a right in this country, employees have a right to organize  and to vote in a union or not.  So what’s happening right now? Well,  currently in 2010, 92 percent of the initial union elections were held under a  voluntary election agreement of when  they had an election, 92 percent. Only 8  percent went to the NLRB election official, at which time then they had to  sit down  together—that’s what happens—to agree on the rules of the election. And as the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. SCOTT) pointed out, the  NLRB is supposed to be a fair arbiter—  like you’re playing a basketball game  and you go to someone’s home gym;  you expect the referees there to carry  out a fair game for both sides—so that  both sides have a chance to give their  side of the story.  So in June of this year, what’s happened? The NLRB issued a rule that  would say that an employer has 7 days  to find an attorney to present their  side of the case. And remember, in this,  just the description of this, there are  over 400 pages of rules that you have to  go through or  information that the  lawyer has to go through and has 7  days to get that done, and an employee  would have  just  10 days  to decide  whether they want a union or not. And  they have that right.  Today, almost 70 percent of the elections held, the union wins. And what’s  the average time of the election? Thirty-one days. So that means if you want  to vote on the 1st of October of 2011,  the average time, by the end of that  month, 70 percent, almost three out of  four, would be picked, yes, we want a  union.  this, after  b0940  So what happens after  these 10 days?  The  second  thing  that  the union  wants  is the amount of  information  that’s required that an employee give  up. What would that be? Well, that  would be personal information, including your work schedule, your home address, phone numbers, etc. Right now,  what we want and what this bill says is  that the employees get to decide with  regard to just their names and what  other ways they want to get contacted.  I think that’s fair. I think that’s right.  Let the employees decide.  Mr. Speaker, also what my colleague  from California spoke of is the bargaining unit. For over two decades, the  NLRB has used a standard to define  what a ‘‘bargaining unit’’ is. This is a  new definition. We have done this for  almost 30 years in this country, and we  want this to change. As I understand  the law, it’s against the law for an employer right now—and it has been for  over  three  decades—to  threaten  a  worker.

842,13,2011-11-18,Mr. NADLER.," I understand their strong feelings, and I  would concur with many of them.  I’d like to thank the gentleman from  Virginia, my good  friend Mr. GOODLATTE, for his efforts to bring this bipartisan resolution to the floor. I also  want to thank him for resisting the efforts of some in his party to enshrine  the disastrous fiscal policies of the Tea  Party into our Constitution.  My colleagues, our budget is broken.  After years of special interest handouts  on both the revenue and spending ledgers, we now have a system that requires us to borrow over $1 trillion just  to meet our basic obligations.  Why? Why do we borrow? Has anybody in this body ever really asked this  question?  It seems we borrow because there is  not the political will in this body to  make  the difficult decisions  in our  country  that we need  to do. We’re  elected leaders. We’re elected to lead.  But when it comes to the long-term fiscal imbalance our Nation faces, many  in this body seem to be more interested  in securing the next election than securing the safety and soundness of our  fiscal future.  And no one party’s at fault. Both parties are responsible for the financial  mess we’re facing. Our national debt  did not reach its current level overnight, although we seem to have amnesia, what happened in September of ’08  when Secretary Paulson came to talk  to us about the sky was falling. But the  problem has been decades in the making, with the current economic climate  making the issue that much more visible.  These are serious times, and serious  times call for serious people to make  serious decisions; and we know what  these decisions must be. We cannot cut  our way out of this mess, and we cannot and should not tax our way out of  this mess. We need, quite simply, a balanced approach that gets us to a balanced budget.  If I could tell you a situation in my  home State, when I was appropriations  chair, we were faced with a budget that  was breaking the constitution.  ",2011

And we worked with downtown, we  worked with  everybody  across  the  State, and we came up with a solution  and it’s working. There’s money in the  bank in Iowa. The unemployment rate  is around 6 percent, and that’s something we need to be striving to achieve  here. We can do it.  What we have left out in this that we  need to consider as we go through the  steps is how do we include the revenue  side of it. We had a revenue piece. But  it’s working. And it’ll work here.  We can do this. Let’s work together.  I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote.  ",2011
846,13,2011-11-18,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield  11⁄2minutes  to  the gentleman  from California (Mr. COSTA).  ",2011
847,13,2011-11-18,Mr. COSTA.," I rise in support of the  bipartisan  balanced  budget  amendment. I want to thank my colleagues,  Congressman GOODLATTE and others,  who have worked on this effort, and  really urge my colleagues that this is  the time that we need to come together  to act on behalf of the better interest  of our Nation.  Clearly, a majority of the citizens I  represent in the San Joaquin Valley  agree that Washington needs to get its  fiscal house in order.  We all want a balanced budget, but  too few are willing to make an agreement that will move us toward that  goal. That’s why the passage of the  constitutional  amendment  requiring  the Federal Government to live within  its means is an important step. But it  is only a step.  To balance our budget, Members of  both parties still have to come together to set priorities and, yes, make  compromises and shared sacrifices to  produce  fair, balanced budgets each  year. And never has the need been ever  so clear.  Our national debt recently surpassed  the GDP for the first time since World  War II. Each American’s share of the  debt is now greater than their average  salary. Congress could have acted sooner, but we haven’t; and we can no  longer afford to wait.  b1040  The bipartisan passage of this balanced budget amendment is an important and necessary step toward a sound  fiscal future, and as a cosponsor, we  should pass this measure. But we also  should reach a larger agreement with  the supercommittee that’s fair and balanced on entitlement reform and revenues. If we do so, we will begin to restore the confidence by the American  public that we can work together to  get our economy back on track and  create  the  jobs  that all Americans  want.  ",2011
848,13,2011-11-18,Mr. NADLER.," Mr. Speaker, it is now  my privilege to yield 4 minutes to a  member of the Ways and Means Committee, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL).  ",2011
849,13,2011-11-18,Mr. NEAL.," I thank the gentleman for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker, earlier this week Bruce  Bartlett, a former Reagan adviser, who  recently testified before the Ways and  Means Committee, commented about  the  Republicans’  balanced  budget  amendment. He stated:  ‘‘The proposal that Republican leaders plan to bring up is, frankly, nuts.  The truth  is that Republicans don’t  care one whit about actually balancing  the budget. They prefer to delude voters with the pie-in-the-sky promises  that amending the Constitution will  painlessly solve our budget problems.’’  Mr. Speaker, the mystical date here  is January 19, 2001. Bill Clinton says  goodbye and leaves a surplus not subject, by the way, to opinion today but  subject to fact of $5.7 trillion. So the  decision is made to cut taxes in 2001 by  a trillion dollars. The decision is made  in 2003 to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion, and  then subsequently to engage in a war  in Iraq based upon the faulty premise  of weapons of mass destruction.  Now, our Republican  friends often  come to the microphone and say things  like, well, we  all  spent  too much  money. No, I didn’t spend too much  money. I voted against the war in Iraq.  I voted against the Bush tax cuts. I  voted against their prescription benefit  proposal.  Our friend from New Jersey a moment ago said the math is clear. But  for Republicans, why is the math only  clear when Bill Clinton  is President  and Barack Obama is President? They  ran these deficits through the roof.  There is no escaping that conclusion.  The budget has been balanced five  times since the end of World War II,  four of those times during the Clinton  Presidency. Twenty-two million  jobs  were created during those years. This  is the equivalent of using a Luger to  clean the wax out of our ears.  This proposal  is beyond  the pale.  They ran across the country for the  last 2 years with the Tea Party-types  saying, Have you read the bill? Yes,  we’ve read the bill, and we’ve come to  the conclusion this is a reckless pursuit of defying our constitutional responsibility when we’ve already demonstrated that we can accomplish these  ends without disturbing the Constitution that they attempted during the  campaign cycle to merit.  Let’s honor the Constitution, the Tea  Party said. And today what do they  propose? Disturbing the Constitution  after their financial malfeasance for 8  years.  This argument  they bring  to  the  floor  today  is a political gimmick.  George Bush, Sr., lobbied me on the  amendment many years ago when it  failed, and respectfully I pointed out to  him that it was nothing more than political theater. When President Bush,  Jr., invited me to the White House to  discuss his tax cut proposal in 2001 a  matter of days after his assumption of  the Presidency, he said this is the people’s money. And he’s right.  But guess what? It’s the people’s responsibility to honor those veterans  hospitals  for 35,000 men and women  who have served us honorably in Iraq  and Afghanistan who are going to need  our care for decades to come. It’s the  people’s responsibility on Social Security, the greatest antipoverty program  in history. It’s the people’s responsibility on Medicare, which has added  years to life and life to years.  This  proposal  today  overdoes  it.

If the gentleman’s complaint is that  there have been decisions made during  Republican Congresses that he doesn’t  agree with that spent too much money,  that didn’t yield to balancing budgets,  the gentleman is correct.  But the gentleman neglects to point  out that there have been many, many  Democratic Congresses in the last 50  years, 37 of them, of which only two of  them resulted  in a balanced budget.  That is not a good record either. In  fact, during the 1990s, when we were  fortunate enough to receive four balanced budgets, those balanced budgets  were under a Republican Congress and  a Democratic President.  b1130  In point of fact, it was only after  there was a confrontation about the  level of spending and a government  shutdown that the necessary reforms  were made to slow the rate of government  spending  so we could achieve  those balanced budgets.  The gentleman from North Carolina  takes credit for his vote in 1993, which  I did not agree with. I’m going to take  credit for my four votes that were balanced budgets  in  1998  through  2001,  which he voted against. So we need bipartisan support for a rule in our Constitution that requires that the budget  be balanced every year, except in times  of national emergency when we should  have bipartisan support to not balance.  At this time  it  is my pleasure to  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. STEARNS), chairman of the  Energy and Commerce Oversight and  Investigation Subcommittee.  ",2011
854,21,2011-11-18,Mr. STEARNS.," I thank my distinguished colleague.  You know, I say to my colleagues on  the Democrat side, we can sit here and  blame Bush; we can sit here, on our  side we could blame President Obama;  and we can have this high rhetoric  talking about this issue but now is the  time to get serious. But we are in a  very precarious situation. This is all  different with a debt to GDP ratio at  100 percent.  When you look at the statistics and  you say, well, look, what’s going to  happen in this country in 10 years, in 10  years 95 percent of all Federal tax revenues will be consumed by payments of  interest on the national debt and mandatory programs like Social Security. I  think you would agree with that. Medicare and Medicaid are also there. This  will leave just about 5 percent of our  annual tax revenue available for funding national defense and other essential functions of the government. So  this is an attempt here today, a very  sober attempt, to control federal budgets and do this through a balanced  budget amendment.  Now, you make a valid argument  about the difference of these 49 States  having an operational balanced budget,  which is they don’t have a capital outlay balanced budget. I understand that  argument. But also, with this constitutional amendment, we are projecting  an attempt to have a rainy-day fund,  where we set aside money  for these  emergencies we all worry about. So  you cannot hang your whole argument  on the difference between the state  operational budgets and a state capital  budget and a federal budget as a reason  for not voting for this because we are  at such dire extreme situations.  And talking about Founding Fathers,  they understood the perils associated  with debt. In fact, Thomas Jefferson  said, ‘‘The principle of spending money  to be paid by future generations, under  the name of funding, is but swindling  futurity on a large scale.’’  We need to come together and understand that this is not business as usual  like when we voted for the constitutional amendment some 16 years ago.  This is a precarious moment in history.  We do not think we can go forward  without controlling our spending, and  this is a legitimate attempt to do so. I  think the high rhetoric on both sides of  blaming different Presidents and talking about the past is gone. We’re talking about the future.  I urge you to support this resolution.  ",2011
855,21,2011-11-18,Mr. NADLER.," Mr. Speaker, either we  will have the discipline to do what we  have to or this amendment simply puts  those decisions in the hands of a Federal judge, which we don’t want to see,  I don’t think.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011
856,21,2011-11-18,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker, it is  my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman  from  Illinois  (Mr.  HULTGREN), a member of  the Agriculture Committee.  ",2011
857,21,2011-11-18,Mr. HULTGREN.," The time is now.  This week we watched as our Nation’s debt reached an unprecedented  level—$15 trillion. This debt crisis was  caused by past administrations and  past Congresses who refused to say no  more spending.  Washington spends too much and is  under water. Because of that, our national security and sovereignty and the  standard of living for our children and  grandchildren are in jeopardy.  Mr. Speaker, the time is now for this  Congress to pass immediate, bold and  permanent spending reforms that will  hold all future Congresses accountable  for their spending. And now we have  the opportunity to do just that by passing a balanced budget amendment to  our Constitution. Let’s forever change  the  way  that Washington  spends  money and bring accountability back  to Congress by passing the balanced  budget amendment  to  the Constitution. We’ve  come  close before, but  there’s no more excuses. The time is  now.  ",2011
858,21,2011-11-18,Mr. NADLER., I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.  ,2011
859,21,2011-11-18,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker, it is  my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. POSEY), a  member of the Financial Services Committee and, as a realtor, may want to  comment on some of the remarks made  here today regarding the ability of people to borrow money under certain circumstances.  ",2011
860,21,2011-11-18,Mr. POSEY.," Well, first I will comment on the value of buying homes on  credit. I think it’s a pretty good idea;  but when you go to get qualified for a  home, the rule of thumb is that you  should buy a home roughly not more  than 2.5 times your annual income. If  you compare that to our known debt of  $15 trillion, our revenues of about $2.2  trillion, you would see that if our debt  was a home loan, it would be 14 times  our annual income. No lender would  loan  you money  under  those  circumstances; they would say you are  bankrupt far beyond any possibility of  recovering. And that doesn’t  include  the $60 trillion unfunded liabilities for  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. So I don’t know if that was really a very good analogy.  Now, to my point, there is an old political axiom that says that anytime  you promise to steal from Peter to pay  Paul, one thing usually happens: Paul  votes for you. Total revenues, as I just  said in answer to the chairman’s question, are about $2.2 trillion; total expenses the Federal Government spends,  $3.6 trillion.

861,29,2011-11-18,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself 1 minute to respond to my  good friend from New York.  I would just say to the gentleman  that we do need to do the job, but you  don’t have to look ahead to wonder  what’s going to happen, all you have to  do is look back. Over the past 50 years  we’ve balanced  the budget  just  six  times and we’ve run up a $15 trillion  national debt. Now, the gentleman has  cited  some  criticism  of Republican  votes, but there are plenty of Democratic votes in the 4 years that the  Democrats were in control of this Congress. Just recently we added $4 trillion to the national debt. Now, the fact  of the matter is, over the 50 years, 37 of  those years Democrats have controlled  the House of Representatives and only  2 of those 37 years was it balanced. So  when the gentleman says that some  years will  run  surpluses  and  some  years will run deficits, that’s very true,  but the history has been almost all of  those years will run deficits unless we  have a discipline in our Constitution to  require that we do otherwise.  And I would also point out that in  the 4 years since the gentleman has  been here and I’ve been here we’ve had  balanced budgets. The gentleman, for  I’m sure reasons that he felt were very  justified, voted against all four of the  budgets that balanced in this Congress.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011
862,29,2011-11-18,Mr. NADLER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself 2 minutes to reply to what the  gentleman just said.  The fact is, the reason this country is  in such deficit is because of a deliberate Republican crusade over the last  30 years to reduce taxes on the rich in  order to deliberately create huge deficits, and to then use those deficits as  the excuse to justify large cuts to gut  Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and education programs that they  have never liked in the first place but  could not justify cutting without it.  Taxes used to be 18 to 19 percent of  the economy, of GDP. Now  they’re  about 14 percent of GDP, and yet the  Republicans won’t increase it because  we have decreased the taxes on the rich  and on the corporations. The country is  not broke; we’re just not taxing the  millionaires and the billionaires the  way we used to.  And the fact is, you look at the history here. When Ronald Reagan took  over as President of the United States,  the entire national debt of the United  States accumulated from George Washington through Jimmy Carter was less  than $800 billion. Then you had 12 years  of Reagan and the first Bush cutting  taxes on the rich. When Clinton took  over, you had a $4.3 trillion deficit, and  it was expected to go much higher. We  made the tough decisions; we voted for  increased taxes in 1993 and for cutting  the budget. And when Clinton left office 8 years later, the budget had been  balanced. But from the time we made  that vote in 1993, the deficit decreased  every year until it became a surplus,  then it increased every year. And when  Bush II took over, we were looking at  a $5.7 trillion surplus over the next 10  years, and we were going to pay off the  entire national  debt. Then we had  those huge Bush tax cuts and the irresponsible, unpaid-for wars. And when  Bush left office, we had a $9.5 trillion  deficit—a turnaround of $15 trillion—  and a recession, which causes the bigger deficits now.  ",2011
863,29,2011-11-18,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  time of the gentleman has expired.  ,2011
864,29,2011-11-18,Mr. NADLER.," I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.  The CBO estimated, before President  Obama took office, that the next year’s  deficit would be $1.2 trillion before he  did anything. And I would remind us  that nondefense discretionary spending  in this country has not gone up by a  nickel, adjusted for inflation and population growth, since 2001, when we had  a huge surplus.  The problem is that our taxes on the  rich are too low. We cannot reach an  agreement in the supercommittee because the Republicans will not tax the  rich. That’s the basic problem, and a  balanced budget amendment will not  solve that problem.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2011
865,29,2011-11-18,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself 1 minute to respond to the  gentleman.  First of all, let me just be very clear  that when the gentleman talks about  the sins that he wants to impose upon  Republicans  for  not  balancing  the  budget, I think that’s a very good argument. But since this is a bipartisan bill  and dozens of his colleagues will be  voting  for this, I think  it’s because  those of us who vote for it recognize  that this is true on both sides of the  aisle, that there has been a lack of  tough decisions that have led to balanced budgets.  Every  single year  I vote  for  the  toughest budget offered in this Congress. Those budgets never pass. Why?  Because there’s no requirement that  they do so. So, what do we have? We  have complaints on the other side of  the aisle that this is a terrible plot on  our part to bring about all kinds of  harsh  cuts.  This  balanced  budget  amendment doesn’t make any distinction between whether you balance a  budget by  raising  taxes or  cutting  spending. I’m going to do  it to cut  spending because I see lots of waste in  our government. And  I’ve voted  for  budgets  that bring about a balance  without raising taxes, but that is not  the point here. The point is that it  doesn’t get done either way.  ",2011

867,29,2011-11-18,Mr. GOODLATTE.," I yield myself an  additional 30 seconds.  As to the gentleman’s complaint that  this is all because we haven’t taxed the  rich, my goodness, in the last Congress,  under the control of your party, you  extended all of those tax cuts for everyone. And the fact of the matter is  that the top 1 percent of American  families pay 38 percent—38 percent—of  the personal income taxes in this country today.  b1250  That, by the way, is up from 34 percent in 2001. So all of this can be on the  table when we have a discussion about  how to balance the budget.  All we’re debating here today is the  principle of whether or not we should  balance the budget and looking at the  past history where we have not, indeed,  balanced it but six times in 50 years.  Mr. Speaker, at this time it is my  pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. WEST), who is  not only a member of the House Armed  Services Committee, but a great advocate for fiscal responsibility and a balanced budget.

869,37,2011-11-18,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Madam Speaker, I  rise  in  support  of  this Balanced Budget  Amendment.  I have always been hesitant  to support  changes to our Constitution. It is the most significant document in our Nation’s history and I  am reminded of its guiding principals by the  copy I carry with me each day.  Truthfully, I wish this step had not become  so necessary. A simple majority of us in the  House, working with the Senate and the President have  the ability  to balance our budget  without this Amendment.  It has been done before. I have been honored  to serve  in  this House  for  the  last 41  years. During this time, we have managed to  balance our budget twice, and both times occurred during my tenure as Chairman of the  House Appropriations Committee.  The way we balanced the budget then was  by making  the hard, but necessary choices.  The Appropriations Committee had to say no  to many funding requests. It was not always  easy and I was not always the most popular  person around here. But we had  to do  the  right thing for the country and we did it as a  Republican House working with a Democrat  President.  In this Congress, the House and the House  Appropriations Committee have made the difis spificult decisions to cut wasteful spending, consolidate duplicative programs, and reign in the  excesses of recent years. We have reduced  excessive spending and passed a responsible  budget resolution. We have brought our bills  to the floor under regular order—in contrast to  recent years. Every Member on  the Committee and in the entire House has had the  opportunity  to make  their voices heard and  offer their amendments. In fact, we have considered almost 500 amendments to appropriations bills just this year.  I am proud to say that the House has made  real progress towards fiscal responsibility. Unfortunately, much of our budget process has  become dysfunctional.  We are stuck with a Senate that has been  unwilling  to do  their part.  It has been more  than  two and a half years since  they have  completed the basic task of passing a budget.  Under  this President, spending has skyrocketed to consume more than 25 percent of  the economy. Since 2008, annual spending  has jumped by close to $1 trillion. The President’s budget proposed to keep the spending  going  for  the next decade, with  spending  growing from its historical average of 18 percent to 24 percent of GDP in 2021.  We have mandatory spending  that  raling out of control.  For the first time in America’s proud history,  our credit rating was downgraded because we  have been unable to come to an enforceable  agreement on how  to bring our debt under  control.  I have come to believe that the only guaranteed way to bring spending under control is to  pass this Balanced Budget Amendment. The  only way to get the entire Congress and the  President  to consistently agree on a  fiscally  responsible budget is to amend the Constitution to require it to happen. It is a common  sense proposal that has widespread support.  In 2009, I asked every voter in my district  how they felt about requiring a balanced budget and 79.64 percent of the more than 32,000  who responded  to my survey said  that  they  support it.  The National Federation  of  Independent  Businesses  recently  asked  small  business  owners in my district if they support the Balanced Budget Amendment and 78 percent responded that they do.  National polls point  to more overwhelming  support. After all,  families and small businesses across the country have to sit down  and balance  their own budgets,  just as our  state of Florida must. Why can’t  the  federal  government do the same?  America has a spending problem. Just on  Wednesday our national debt topped $15 trillion. We are borrowing 43 cents for every dollar we spend. This year gross  interest payments on the debt reached $466 billion. Every  one of our children and our grandchildren already owes more than $46,000 to our creditors.  We owe it to the next generation to leave  them a better country and a better future, as  those who came before us did. It is essential  that we change  the culture of spending  in  Washington and  restore  fiscal sanity  to our  federal budget. It is crucial to the future of our  Nation  that we solve  this debt problem, because if we don’t, I hate to think what might  happen to our economy, what might happen to  our currency, and what might happen to our  standing in the world.  Let me close by saying  that  to have a  strong national defense we must have a  strong robust economy.  ",2011
870,37,2011-11-18,Mr. THORNBERRY.," Madam Speaker,  it  would be a mistake to believe that a Balanced  Budget Amendment  to  the Constitution will  solve all of our  fiscal woes. There are no  magic answers  to what ails us. Fiscal discipline and common sense applied day-by-  day, year-by-year are required.  A Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution would, however, help impose the discipline needed on the taxing and spending decisions of the federal government. It would be  a very significant step—perhaps one of  the  most significant we could  take—in  repairing  our fiscal house.  It  forces Congress and  the President  to  make choices. If new spending is proposed,  other spending must be cut or some other way  to finance the new program must be found.  A basic principle for individuals, businesses,  and other organizations is that one should not  spend more than one has to spend, except in  extraordinary circumstances. That is common  sense. Yet,  for  too  long,  that principle has  been commonly absent from Washington. This  vote on this Amendment is our opportunity to  apply  this basic  idea  to  the  federal government. We should do it now.  ",2011
871,37,2011-11-18,Mr. POSEY.," Madam Speaker, nearly every  State in the union is required to balance its  budget each year, including my home State of  Florida. Our counties, cities, school boards  and special districts are all required to make  financially responsible decisions with the hard-  earned tax dollars of Florida’s working families  and small businesses.  It is long past due for Washington to do the  same, which  is why  the Balanced Budget  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is one of  the first bills I cosponsored as a new Member  of Congress in 2009.  For 235 years, the United States has been  the greatest economic success story the world  has ever known. Yet,  the most significant  threat ever to our continued success is our unprecedented  and  rapidly  growing  national  debt. From 1776 to 2008, Washington accumulated a debt of $10.6 trillion. Yet in just the  last 3 years alone, another $4.4 trillion in debt  has been added for a grand total of $15 trillion  and counting.  Washington doesn’t  just have a spending  problem.  It has an  insatiable addiction  to  spending money  it does not have and  it  is  threatening our children’s  future. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff called it the  greatest threat to our Nation.  The  last  time  the House voted on and  passed a Balanced Budget Amendment to the  Constitution—back in 1997—the national debt  stood at $5.4 trillion. That year the Balanced  Budget Amendment fell just ONE VOTE short  of passage in the Senate. It’s something I like  to call ‘‘The Ten Trillion Dollar Vote.’’  So, you might ask: How do these gigantic  numbers relate to the American taxpayer? Because  of Washington’s  failure  to  control  spending, each and every taxpayer’s share of  the debt amounts to $130,000. It gets worse.  On our current path,  the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates  the national debt will reach $23 TRILLION in 2015.  That’s $200,000  in debt per  taxpayer. This  must change.

It’s not one that raises  taxes. It’s not one which is going to  add to the deficit. It is the American  Energy &  Infrastructure  Jobs Act,  which will be introduced soon.  It is an act that in part is related to  a bill that I have presented  in this  Chamber for several years now in a bipartisan move to get America back to  work.  Instead  of  importing  $129  billion  worth of oil every year and sending  them our wealth, it uses our oil off our  coasts to create jobs.  Our infrastructure in America has a  $2 trillion pricetag to repair our roads,  highways, and bridges. We also still  have 14 million Americans out of work  and another  10 million  looking  for  work. It’s time America got back to  work, and we can do it with this bill. I  urge all of my colleagues to make sure  they’re part of this bill when it comes  out and get Americans back to work  and rebuild America once again.  f  YUCCA MOUNTAIN  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  LANDRY).

873,45,2011-11-18,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Speaker, I come  down to the floor once a week to talk  about the high level of nuclear waste in  this country and the  fact that this  country still doesn’t have a single repository  to  store high-level nuclear  waste.  Throughout  this  last  year,  I’ve  talked  about Hanford, Washington,  which has multiple gallons of high-  level nuclear waste. I then went to  Zion nuclear power plant  right off  Lake Michigan to talk about its nuclear waste right next to the lake. A  couple of weeks ago, I went to Savannah, Georgia, to talk about the Savannah River and the nuclear power plant  that sits right next to the river. Then  I went to the Pacific Ocean between  Los Angeles  and  San Diego,  San  Onofre, where there’s a nuclear power  plant right on the Pacific Ocean.  Today I take the Nation to Idaho,  where Idaho National Laboratory is located, comparing  this  site, as  I do  weekly, to the fine location under FedE N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 P 8 X W T 2 K S D n o eral law in the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act which is Yucca Mountain.  Look at what we have at Idaho National Laboratory. At the national labs  we  have  5,090  canisters  of  nuclear  waste.  Yucca Mountain,  none.  At  Idaho, the waste is stored above ground  and in pools. At Yucca Mountain, the  waste would be stored 1,000 feet from  the surface of the ground. At Idaho, the  waste would be 500 feet above the water  table. At Yucca Mountain, the waste  would be 1,000  feet above the water  table. Idaho National Laboratory, 50  miles  from Yellowstone Park; Yucca  Mountain, the waste would be 100 miles  from the Colorado River.  Now, why is it important to address  these different locations of high-level  nuclear waste across the country? Because there’s 104 nuclear reactors in  this country, not including all of the  high-level nuclear waste that we have  at our defense labs, our DOE labs, and  the like.  So what this country needs to understand is there’s nuclear waste all over  the place and next to major population  centers and next to major water reserves.  What I’ve also done in coming down  here has been to highlight how do the  Senators  from  the States  that  surround the Idaho nuclear lab—what are  their positions? And their positions are  as follows.  Senator BARRASSO from Wyoming is  a supporter of Yucca Mountain and has  stated that the end result of this saga  is a 5-mile long, 25-foot-wide hole in  the Nevada desert. It was meant to  store America’s nuclear waste but instead, because of politics, it stands as a  monument  to bureaucratic waste of  taxpayer dollars.  What does Senator ENZI say, who’s  also supported and voted  for Yucca  Mountain in 2002?  ‘‘In his campaign,  President Obama promised change. He  promised  politics wouldn’t  interfere  when  sound  science  spoke.  I’m disappointed  that his Yucca Mountain  policy ignores that campaign promise.’’  voted ‘‘yes’’ for Yucca  Mountain, and he’s disappointed in the  administration.  And the new Senator  Senator RISCH, says:  ‘‘The President’s decision to kill the  Nation’s congressionally directed repository for high-level nuclear waste as  a favor to one State is politics at its  worst. The Administration’s decision  to knowingly undermine their commitments to Idaho and 33 other States  with no clear alternative cannot stand.  This has become a hallmark of this administration,  first with the Guantanamo prison site and now Yucca Mountain—to jump without knowing where  they are going to land.’’  b1420  The other thing I’ve been doing has  just been highlighting, as  I’ve been  taking the country through the high-  level nuclear waste areas around this  country: Where are the Senators based  MIKECRAPO Idaho,  from  upon their past votes or current statements?  Right now, we have 17 Senators in  support; we have three in opposition;  and we have four who really have no  defined positions as of yet. Senator  FEINSTEIN, of course, has spoken in opposition to Yucca Mountain; but with  Fukushima Daiichi and with the fact  that she has nuclear power plants on  the shore of the Pacific Ocean, I think  she is reevaluating that position.  We need 60 votes in the Senate to  move forward and to finish the science  on Yucca Mountain so that, by Federal  law, Yucca Mountain becomes the single repository  for high-level nuclear  waste in this country.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back  the balance of my time.  f  COMMERCE CLAUSE  ",2011

Because  you  have  rejected  knowledge, I also reject you as My priests;  because you have ignored the law of your  God, I also will ignore your children.  This is a promise from a holy, righteous God who could do nothing else but  fulfill that promise. We have to look at  this and understand that, in this country, we have a  tremendous  lack of  knowledge about our U.S. Constitution  and that we have a tremendous lack of  knowledge about the biblical foundations of our Nation and of how our  Founding Fathers believed in liberty.  We’re losing that liberty tremendously  because we have a tremendous lack of  knowledge.  In Psalm 11, God says:  If the foundations are destroyed, what are  the righteous to do?  I believe it’s a call to duty to rebuild  the foundational principles that are behind liberty.  Sworn officers of the United States—  in fact, all public servants—have taken  an oath to uphold the Constitution  against enemies both foreign and domestic; and for decades, sworn officers  of the United States have been violating that oath to uphold and protect  our Nation’s most precious document,  the U.S. Constitution. Domestically,  there are many by their actions, either  intentionally or unintentionally, who  undermine our governing document.  Every day, officials,  ranging  from  Federal  judges  to U.S. Senators  to  Members of the House to leadership, ignore the original intent of our Founders that was put in the Constitution of  the United States. The distortion is so  great now that there is little correlation between their words and our actions here in Washington, D.C. This has  become the norm for today’s body of  government, but it was not what the  great lawmakers of the past envisioned  for America’s future.  l a e n b j VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:22 Dec 08, 2011 Jkt 099060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD11\RECFILES\H18NO1.REC H18NO1         ",2011
876,53,2011-11-18,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  the Speaker’s announced policy of January 5, 2011, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL) is recognized for 30  minutes.  ",2011
877,53,2011-11-18,Mr. WOODALL.," Mr. Speaker, this is  my first time down here as a freshman  during Special Orders, my first time  trying to coordinate charts and talk  the talk and walk the walk all at the  same time.  But I’m excited about it because I’m  down here to talk about the Fair Tax.  And if folks don’t know what the Fair  Tax is, it’s H.R. 25. You can find it at  www.thomas.gov, that site that everybody should have bookmarked if you  care about what goes on here on the  House floor. Because if you don’t know,  everything that goes on here is available in realtime at www.thomas.gov.  It’s done through the Library of Congress. It’s not a Republican thing or a  Democrat thing. It’s just the real deal,  what’s actually happening down here.  And if you go and you look up H.R.  25, it’s the Fair Tax. What the Fair Tax  is  is a bill that repeals all  income-  based Federal taxes and replaces them  with consumption-based taxes.  Now, my  friend  from Texas  (Mr.  GOHMERT) was just down here on the  House floor, Mr. Speaker. He was talking about our Founding Fathers and  those things that were happening between 1776 and 1787. And in that time,  we funded all the Federal Government  with consumption taxes—it was not income taxes; it was consumption taxes—  under  the  theory  that  if you had  enough resources to go out and buy  that silver tea set from England, then  you had enough resources to help fund  the Republic. And if you spent all your  time working on your farm, and you  just barely had enough money to buy  thread at the local five-and-dime, then  we weren’t going to tax you as heavily.  b1550  If you look at this poster, Mr. Speaker, in 1913, right before the income tax  began, we had 400 pages of Tax Code in  America. Just the last century, in the  1900s, 400 pages of Tax Code and regulations. By World War II, that 400 pages  had grown to 8,000 pages, 20 times as  much Tax Code by the end of World  War II. By the time we were in Korea,  14,000 pages of code and regulation. By  the 1970s, 19,000 pages of code and regulation. And in the 1980s, 26,300 pages of  Tax Code and regulation.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I’m a reader. I  love to sit down and educate myself  through the written word; but I have to  tell you, 26,000 pages of Tax Code and  regulation is going to make a criminal  out of all of us because you can’t possibly understand all of the ramifications of the tax consequences of your  decision.  Do you remember 1986? That was the  last time we fundamentally overhauled  the Tax Code. 1986. In fact, if you go to  www.Thomas.gov, like I suggested, and  you look at the laws and regulations,  you’ll see the Tax Code of 1986. It was  the Tax Code of 1954, updated Tax Code  to 1986. That was the last time we flattened rates and broadened the basis.  Flattened the rates and broadened the  base. And where did we end up? Between 1984 when we had 26,000 pages of  Tax Code  and  regulation, we went  through this process of simplifying the  income tax, and 10 years later in 1995,  we have 40,000 pages of Tax Code. By  simplifying the income tax, we grew it  from 26,000 pages to 40,000 pages.  Now, Mr. Speaker, if you’re like me,  you go out and you shop around. Are  you going to use the H&R Block tax  software? Are you going to use the  Microsoft tax software? What kind of  tax software are you going to use, because you hate paying accountants to  do your taxes for you.  You know, I used to just sit down  with a pen and paper and do it myself.  I used to go through with my calculator and do it myself, but it has gotten  too  complicated. Why? Because  since I have reached the age of majority in 1988, here we have 1995 when I’m  coming out of college, between 1995 and  2004, we added another 20,000 pages to  the Tax Code,  from  40,000 pages  to  60,000 pages. In 2007, to 67,000 pages;  2008 kept it to just a little over 67,000  pages. And in 2009, it jumped another  3,000 pages; 70,000 pages of tax legislation.  And to be clear, Mr. Speaker, when  we talk about tax  legislation, we’re  talking about the ways in which the  government separates you and me and  all of the American people from our  paycheck. That’s all there is in the Tax  Code. All the Tax Code is, is how do we  separate  the American people  from  their  productivity?  It  takes  70,000  pages  in 2009 to sort that out. And  71,000 pages  in 2010. And now, 72,000  pages of Tax Code in 2011.  Folks, what the FAIR Tax does, H.R.  25, it asks the question that if we could  start from scratch—and by scratch I  mean from the 72,000 pages that we do  today, to just a blank sheet of paper—  if you could start  from scratch and  draft the Tax Code that America ought  to have instead of the one that has  been forced upon us, what would you  do? What would you do?  Well, there’s a lot of difference of  opinion on what to do, but simplification seems to be one of those things  that we can all agree on.  You know,  I didn’t come  to  this  House to try to be a good Republican.  I came to this House to try to be a good  American, and there are lots of opportunities to do that. I  like to think  those  things  occur  simultaneously  more often than not. But look at what  folks  are  saying  about  the United  States Tax Code.

927,69,2011-11-18,Mr. LEVIN.," I thank the Senator from  New Mexico for his remarks. I agree  with him; it was a lively debate. I also  agree with him it is to be desired that  kind of debate occurs more often in the  Senate. The Senator from New Mexico  has been very active in the effort to  have these kinds of debates by rules  changes, which would make  these  kinds of debates a lot more likely, and  by other mechanisms.  To make an inquiry, did the Senator  from New Mexico restore the regular  order  to  the Levin-McCain  amendment? I missed that.  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I did. Let  me say to Chairman LEVIN, not only  lively, robust, but very informative. I  learned a lot in the process of listening  to him and to Senator MCCAINand Senator DURBIN and the other Senators  who came down about  the  issue.  I  think that is the way the Senate works  best: to have the amendments and various provisions of the Defense authorization bill be a part of a lively and informative debate.  I thank the Senator for that, and I  yield the floor.  ",2011
928,69,2011-11-18,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President,  I assume, then, having watched the debate  and been informed, that the Senator  from New Mexico now takes the position that Senator LEVIN and I do on  this issue, and his next mission is to  convince his colleague from Colorado  of the correctness of our position?  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. At this  point I am still listening and trying to  ascertain as much as I can about the  actual provisions of the Defense authorization bill. But the Senator is correct. There could be trouble in Udall  Valley. There might be a split. We do  not see that yet, but there is a possibility of it.  ",2011
929,69,2011-11-18,Mr. MCCAIN.,"  One  thing  I  have  learned about the Senator from New  Mexico is that he does give all issues a  fair and objective hearing. He listens  and he pays attention and he is informed in his decisions. I thank him for  taking part in this one.  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I also  know that when the two of my colleagues—when the chairman and Senator MCCAIN, the ranking member—  come together on a prevision and are  able to persuade their committee to go  with  it, that says something to the  Senate itself, to have that before the  Senate. I want to study it very carefully.  I know Senator GRAHAM was  down here, who has been very active on  this  issue  and  has  a  tremendous  amount of experience. I look forward to  the continuing debate, and I yield the  floor.  ",2011
930,69,2011-11-18,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, I thank  the Senator from New Mexico again for  the comments, but also tell him how  very much impressed I have been right  from the first day I heard him with his  openmindedness on subjects. It is very  important that we keep open minds,  and he has shown just how to do that.  We appreciate that on an issue this  complex, particularly on the Defense  bill.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the  roll.  ",2011
931,69,2011-11-18,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, I ask  unanimous consent the order for the  quorum call be rescinded.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  ",2011
932,69,2011-11-18,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, our staff  is working  on  various  amendments  that we could get approved by both  sides. We think there are a number of  those on which we can get agreement  to make progress today. While we are  going through that process, I would  like to point out the front page of this  morning’s Wall Street Journal, I am  sorry to note, may be a harbinger of  events that will happen in the future,  that will  take place  in  the  future,  which will  be  unfortunate  for  the  United States of America and indeed  tragic for Iraq.  The  front page of the Wall Street  Journal today says ‘‘Standoff Over U.S.  Airbase in Iraq.’’  A tense standoff between local police and  the Iraqi Army played out on Thursday at  the gate of the U.S. airbase in the northern  city of Kirkuk, where a dispute over land  and oil  threatens national  stability and  unity as U.S. forces withdraw.  The territorial conflict, between the central government in Baghdad and the semiautonomous Kurdistan region,  is  just one  flash point that some American and Iraqi officials say could boil over after the full pullout of U.S. troops at the end of December.  Fears of a clash between Iraqi troops and  Kurdish forces were heightened on Thursday  when  the  Kurdish-dominated  police  in  Kirkuk blocked  senior  Iraqi Army  commanders from entering the airbase, where  they said they were planning to take over  the facility from the U.S. military.  The Army officials brought reporters from  Iraqi State-owned television to document  the handover, in what appeared to be an effort to show the nation that Baghdad was in  charge. The central government, headed by  Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, is increasingly eager to project its power ahead of the  U.S. pullout.  This is about a volatile region, particularly in the area around Kirkuk,  which is also symptomatic of the entire  northern  Iraq  border  between  Kurdistan, the semiautonomous region  of Iraq, and the rest of Iraq. The area is  inhabited by different ethnic groups  that range from Turkmen to Arab to  other nationalities who all inhabit the  area. One of the reasons some of us  wanted to have a residual force remain  in Iraq—one of actually three major  reasons—was because of the tensions in  this area which have already bubbled  up on several occasions. In fact, there  was a point some months ago where  two forces were—the Pershmaga, the  Kurdish military, and the Iraqi military—close  to a  shooting  situation.  The U.S. forces intervened. Obviously,  they are not going to be there. Obviously, already before they have even  left there has been a tense standoff at  one of the major airbases in Iraq.  I greatly  fear—I pray not, but  I  greatly fear that we will see more and  more of these kinds of tensions between the Kurdish area and the rest of  Iraq. A lot of it has to do with oil. A lot  of it has to do with who is going to control the oil revenues in the area. Other  parts go back to the era of Saddam  Hussein, where he moved out Kurdish  individuals and others and moved in  people who were loyal to him. There  are still enormous land disputes in the  area as well. Suffice to say, it is a place  of great tension. I continue to be deeply worried about this kind of tension  which could lead to armed conflict, but  also over time, in the view of some,  could lead to an actual breakup of Iraq  into Kurdish areas, Sunni areas, and  even two different Shia areas of Iraq.  I am sorry to see this. I am sorry this  is happening and that there are more  people who are predicting greater tensions in the area, but I have to say, I  am surprised. I am not surprised. The  sad thing about all this—I had a rather,  shall I say, spirited exchange with the  Secretary of Defense the other day in  the hearing that was held in the Armed  Services Committee. This isn’t a policy  matter, this is a not an issue of whether we should have French fries served  in school lunches. This is an issue we  have shed the blood of well over 4,400  young Americans. I greatly fear that  the opportunity  that was purchased  with  their expenditure of American  blood and  treasure may go all  for  naught because of our failure to maintain a residual force in Iraq which, I repeat, was always envisioned when the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  06:39 Nov 19, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A18NO6.013 S18NOPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2011
933,77,2011-11-18,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, today I  offer an amendment to the National  Defense  Authorization  Act,  NDAA,  that would address an overbroad exemption to the Freedom of Information  Act, FOIA, contained in the bill. This  amendment is supported by a broad coalition  of  open  government  groups  from across the political spectrum. I  hope that the Senate will adopt it.  For 45 years, the Freedom of Information Act has been a cornerstone of  open government and a hallmark of our  democracy, ensuring that the American people have access to their government’s records. My amendment will  help ensure that FOIA remains a viable  tool for access to information that impacts  the health and  safety of  the  American public.  I am concerned that the exemption  included in the NDAA would allow the  Department of Defense to keep secret  important information that Americans  need to know to protect their own  health and safety. For example, there  have been alarming reports about the  Department of Defense keeping citizens in the dark about health hazards,  such as groundwater contamination on  military  facilities, by claiming that  this information was a matter of national security. While I certainly understand the need for the government  to keep certain sensitive information  confidential, I believe this exemption  goes too far.  This amendment adds a public interest balancing test to the Secretary of  Defense’s determination about whether  to withhold critical infrastructure information from the public. This change  will help ensure that truly sensitive information is protected, while allowing  the public to obtain important information  about  potential  health  and  safety concerns. An essentially identical provision  is  contained  in  the  House-passed version of this bill.  The amendment I offer today will  also revise the language in section 1044  related to Military Flight Operations  Quality Assurance Systems to ensure  that truly sensitive flight information  is protected, while maintaining  the  public’s interest in obtaining information about the safety of military aircraft.  This amendment strikes an appropriate balance between  safeguarding  the ability of the Department of Defense to perform its vital missions and  the public’s right to know. I hope that  all Senators will support this commonsense amendment and that the Senate  will adopt it without delay.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of a  letter  in  support of  this  amendment be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  NOVEMBER17, 2011.  DEARSENATORS: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, we are writing to urge  you to support an amendment offered by  Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to fix an over-  broad and ill-defined provision relating to  ‘‘critical  infrastructure  information,’’  in  Section 1044 of the National Defense Authorization Act that could prevent the public  from having access to critical health and security information.  Section 1044, as written in the bill passed  by the Senate Armed Services Committee,  grants the Secretary of Defense, or his delegate, the authority to expand protections  from public disclosure for any information  that could result in the  ‘‘disruption, degradation, or destruction’’ of Department of  Defense (DoD) operations, property, or facilities. The language defining ‘‘critical infrastructure information’’ is exceedingly broad,  encapsulating information that is crucial for  the public to understand public health and  safety risks and  information already protected under one of the Freedom of Information Act’s (FOIA) other exemptions.  We believe that the provision is intended  to address agency concerns about protecting  information since the Supreme Court threw  out the broad use of FOIA Exemption Two in  Milner v. Department of Navy. Granting DoD  carte-blanche to withhold information under  an exceedingly broad and ill-defined rubric of  ‘‘critical infrastructure information’’ is not  the right step, especially given that DoD has  misused such authority to hide information  in the past.  Between 1957 and 1987, the United States  Marine Corps knowingly allowed as many as  one million Marines and their family members at Camp Lejeune to be exposed to a host  of toxic chemicals, including known human  carcinogens benzene and vinyl chloride. Civilian employees who worked on the base  and people who  live  in the communities  around the base near Jacksonville, NC, are  now reporting a high incidence of cancers.  For years, the Marine Corps kept this secret,  blocking many attempts  to uncover  the  truth—even after the first news of water contamination broke in 1987. Many FOIA requests for information about the contamination were denied, sometimes using Exemption Two in a way that is no longer allowable after this year’s Milner decision. The  entire truth about the incident only came to  light in part from information accidentally  (and temporarily) posted on the internet by  the Marine Corps.  We support language in Senator Leahy’s  proposed  amendment  that  helps  protect  against such cover-ups by requiring DoD to  weigh whether there is an over-riding public  interest in disclosing the information and  further protects public health and safety by  tightening the definition of ‘‘critical infrastructure security information’’ to make it  clear that the Secretary may withhold only  information  that  could  substantially  increase effectiveness of a terrorist attack.  The Leahy Amendment also would slightly  modify another exemption to FOIA in Section 1044 for information in the data files of  the Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance System, which we support, though  we would prefer it to be further narrowed or  stricken altogether.  We urge you to pass the Leahy Amendment  to narrow the overly-broad Section 1044, and  welcome an opportunity to discuss this issue  with you further.

I am confident that is in large  part due to the leadership of Senator  LEVIN, who is a professional, skilled  lawyer, who knows the big picture and  the small details of the legislation. It  has been a pleasure to work with him  over the years. I have learned a great  deal about our defense from him and  how legislation is enacted. So I want to  express my appreciation for that.  And I thank Senator MCCAIN, who  brings a vast knowledge of defense and  military issues, and who is courageous  in defending what he believes the legitimate interests of the United States  are. That has been a real pleasure.  I will join Senator LEVINin thanking  Senator AYOTTEfor her leadership. Her  contributions to our committee have  been immediate, and that is reflected  in the fact that Senator MCCAINhas  asked her to manage the floor today  for him. I also appreciate the Senator’s  work on the budget and the effort we  have made there.

942,85,2011-11-18,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. President, I wish  to share a few general comments about  where we are. All of us have been confronting, whether we want to or not—I  think some of us more realistically  than others—the debt situation this  Nation faces. We are, indeed, borrowing  40 cents of every $1 we spend. That is  an unsustainable path. We have already had 3 consecutive years of deficits exceeding $1 trillion, and we are  projected to have another trillion-dollar deficit next year.  The debt under President Obama has  now increased by 42 percent in the first  3 years of his term in office. It is an  unsustainable course. We have to do  better.  The National Defense Authorization  Act represents our committee’s vision  for defense in the future. We have done  something about the spending problem  America has. As we calculate the numbers, we are down from $548 billion—in  actual money spent on the Defense Department last year—to $527 billion this  year, an actual reduction, in noninflation-adjusted dollars, of over $20 billion, which represents about a 5-percent reduction, a 4-percent reduction in  defense spending.

949,93,2011-11-18,Mr. ENZI.," Mr. President, I was sorry  to hear the supercommittee is in trouble, that they might not be able to  agree. Then this morning’s Washington  Post  front page headline was  ‘‘Debt  Panel  Failure Won’t  Cause  Catastrophe.’’  Every day we do not find a solution,  every day we spend is a catastrophe.  We have maxed out our credit cards.  Here is one way that came to my attention. I was traveling in Wyoming  and I checked into the hotel for the  night. The person checking me in, very  embarrassed, said: I am sorry, but it  will not take your credit card. It was a  Federal credit card.  I said: Goodness, we are in more trouble than I thought. I gave them my  personal credit card and  that went  right through so I am not sure where  we are. But I know we have maxed out  our credit cards and not just that but  also the symbolic credit cards that we  have. We have as much debt as we  probably can sustain and as debt comes  due across the world for other countries,  it  is going to be tougher and  tougher to be able to sell more debt.  We are kind of in the same situation  as Greece and Italy, except  for two  things. No. 1 is we are a big, flexible  country that has pulled itself out of  terrible  situations  time  and  time  again, and we will do it this time too.  We also own our own money supply.  That helps.  When constituents ask what can they  expect, I always start the conversation  by saying you should expect to get no  more than what the 2008 level was. We  increased  things  considerably  after  that with the stimulus bill and that increased some bases. We have to get  back down to 2008, just as a beginning.  I have to say the President has had a  chance to change direction. I have to  congratulate the President for naming  a deficit commission. I even like the  people he named to it, with Senator  Simpson  from Wyoming and Erskine  Bowles heading up that committee. I  think they did some tremendous work.  I think we should pay more attention  to what they had to say.  I had a little disappointment when  the President did his State of  the  Union speech following their report. He  had an opportunity to repaint the same  bleak picture that committee painted  and America would have understood  better. Although from traveling across  our country, and particularly in Wyoming, I know the people there understand it better than Congress does. But  he could have changed it by repainting  that picture and then he could have  followed it up with a solution which  would have been his budget. Instead,  his budget was another stimulus plan.  It has been voted on by Congress. It  was not voted for by Congress, it was  voted on by Congress, and it was voted  97 to nothing—it was defeated. I think  the deficit commission report would  have done much better.  Congress has also had the chance to  change direction—and in some cases we  have. We have kind of eliminated earmarks. There are still some of them  that are slipped  in, but we kind of  eliminated them. We have a couple new  problems. Now we add demonstration  projects. We have always had demonstration projects, but now we do it as  a substitute for earmarks and that is  where we allow maybe five States to  have an opportunity to do a particular  program to see if it works. So we fund  it in a minimal amount—that still is  millions. The difficulty is that at the  end of the period of time for that demonstration project, they all work. They  are all spectacular. They all would save  America if we just put it in every single State and funded it from the Federal Government.  It can’t happen. We are out of money.  There are lots of good ideas out there,  lots of good  ideas that would help.  When those ideas are proved—the idea  with  the  demonstration  is  that  it  would demonstrate well enough how  good it is that somewhere at the local  level that project would be picked up  and done or forgotten. But, no, we do  make them a national program and we  do  fund  them  forever  in chunks of  time.  Another thing we are doing is that  we propose a project and, because we  like the word  ‘‘pay-for,’’ because we  should pay for whatever we are doing,  we put up a project, we put a 2-year  limit on the project, and then we pick  a pay-for by showing some program  that, if it were eliminated for 10 years,  might bring in that amount of revenue.  We cannot pay for a 2-year program  with 10 years’ worth of revenue because  somebody is going to spend the rest of  that anyway and it may never be collected. A Congress can change its mind  all the time. We have to quit using  gimmicks and we have to quit adding  new programs. What part of maxed out  credit cards don’t we understand? We  have to quit buying votes with dollars  we do not have.  We do have to address mandatory  spending. Social Security and Medicare  have been a problem for a long time. I  remember when I first came to Congress, President Clinton was the President and he called for a special conference on Social Security. We had 1  day where we got to be initiated into  what all the problems were—fantastic  speakers. We had a second day where  Members of the House and Congress  met in smaller committees to work on  pieces of the Social Security problem.  We came up with a plan and President  Clinton  looked at the plan and met  with us as a group and said: If all of  you are willing to put your fingerprint  on this, we will do it. We can only do it  if everybody puts their fingerprint on  it so both parties are responsible for it,  and everybody in the room agreed to do  that.  Unfortunately, we were distracted a  little bit by something called Monica  Lewinsky, and that bill never came up  anywhere.  The situation we are in right now is  passing bills to fail. Each side has a  tendency to put up a bill that has  something good in it, packaged with  something they like but the other side  doesn’t like. It is going to get defeated  on the basis of what each side doesn’t  like and the good part is left out. That  is not going to get anything done for  us.  We have tried the stimulus bill. We  got negligible effects on jobs. It did escalate the basis for budgets and it was  the use of one-time money. That has  created some problems for it. We hear  that 30,000 teachers and firefighters are  going to be laid off. That comes from  safety money and  education money  that went to the States. It was one-  time money. They cannot use one-time  money for a continuing contract. If a  State did, yes, they are having to lay  off people because the stimulus is not  being repeated each and every year.  Are there solutions? Yes, there are  solutions. I am optimistic about the solutions. I do recognize everything has  to be on the table and we should all  reread the deficit commission report.  We have to ask constituents to suggest  their own programs to reduce.  In the spring, we will be inundated by  a whole lot of people who will be ready  to have us support the program that  makes a difference in their life and the  life of the community. I always ask  them how we are going to pay for it?  They always suggest somebody else’s  program to cancel. There are never any  suggestions of how to consolidate within their own program and do it. They  have to do it and each of us in Congress  needs to evaluate our own programs.  Not all of them can be sacred cows. I  wish  to congratulate Senator RUBIO  and Senator COONS for a jobs creation  bill they have put together. They have  taken the diverse bills from both sides  of the aisle and several others and  looked to see if there was any common  thread. All they did was pick out the  common thread from each of those and  put them into a bill. If both sides and  others in Congress like it, why would  that not pass and pass quickly?  I congratulate our Congresswoman  LUMMIS, from Wyoming. She is on the  Appropriations  Committee.  I  think  that is the first time we have ever had  anybody on the Appropriations Committee. She gets into the details of the  budget. In fact, she has gotten into details of the budget down to very small  VerDate Mar 15 2010  04:56 Nov 19, 2011 Jkt 019060 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G18NO6.048 S18NOPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 5 K S D n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2011
950,101,2011-11-18,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of an amendment to the National  Defense  Authorization  Act,  which would repeal the Cold War-era  Jackson-Vanik  trade  restrictions on  Moldovan products and thereby provide  impetus for closer U.S. strategic engagement between our two nations.  I have introduced this legislation in  the previous three Congresses and believe that the time is ripe for Moldova  to finally be granted permanent normal trade relations. Moldova has been  in the WTO since 2001 but still remains  subject to Jackson-Vanik, despite currently being in full compliance with  Jackson-Vanik-related concerns. Until  the United States terminates application of Jackson-Vanik on Moldova, the  U.S. will not benefit from Moldova’s  market access commitments nor can it  resort to WTO dispute resolution mechanisms. While all other WTO members  currently  enjoy  these  benefits,  the  United States does not.  The Republic of Moldova has been  evaluated every year and granted normal trade relations with the United  States  through  annual  presidential  waivers from the effects of Jackson-  Vanik.  The Moldovan  constitution  guarantees  its citizens  the  right  to  emigrate and this right is respected in  practice. Most emigration restrictions  were eliminated in 1991 and virtually  no problems with emigration have been  reported since independence. More specifically, Moldova does not impose emigration restrictions on members of the  Jewish community. Synagogues function openly and without harassment.  As a result, several past administrations, including this one, have found  that Moldova is in full compliance with  Jackson-Vanik’s provisions.  The United States and Moldova have  established a strong record of achievement in security and non-proliferation  cooperation.  We  have  encouraged  Moldova’s ambition of European integration, particularly  in  light of the  new coalition that was swept to power  in 2009, the Alliance for European Integration.  One of the areas where we can deepen  U.S.-Moldovan  relations  is  bilateral  trade. In light of its adherence to freedom of emigration requirements, compliance with threat reduction and cooperation  in the global war on terrorism, the products of Moldova should  not be subject to the sanctions of Jackson-Vanik.  The continued support and encouragement of the United States and the  international community will be key  to  encouraging  the Government  of  Moldova to follow through on important reforms. The permanent waiver of  Jackson-Vanik and establishment of  permanent normal trade relations will  be the  foundation on which  further  progress  in a burgeoning  economic,  trade, and security partnership can be  made.  I am hopeful that my colleagues will  join me in supporting this important  amendment.  f  FDIC  ",2011

952,109,2011-11-18,Mr. ENZI.," I rise today to introduce  my Buy Back America Bonds bill, S.  1909. This bill will not only help raise  awareness of our Nation’s debt crisis,  but it will also give every American  the chance to be a part of the solution  to fix our country’s fiscal dilemma. My  bill will allow Americans to invest in  this incredible country and bring foreign-held U.S. debt back to American  hands while at the same time reducing  Federal Government spending. But before  I talk about where my bill  is  going, I want to explain where I am  coming from.  In World War II, war bonds were sold  to help pay for our Nation’s national  defense and reduce the amount of debt  incurred. People  from  all kinds  of  backgrounds saved toward purchasing  war bonds, often with nickels, dimes,  and quarters. On the job, people deducted the cost of war bonds from their  meager paychecks. Families  invested  in war bonds and saved for the future.  During World War II, President Roosevelt even asked the Boy Scouts of  America to sell war bonds, and they  did.  Boy  Scouts  and Girl  Scouts  worked with their packs and troops to  sell bonds to their neighbors and communities. In other words, all across the  country, folks of all walks and types  were working together for one collective goal—to do their part for the country’s war effort. Men, women, and children were selling and purchasing these  war bonds, all in the name of lending a  hand to our fellow countrymen and to  pay for the costs of war.  I was born during World War II. When  I was born, my parents bought me a  war bond. I still have that $20 bond  today. Not cashing it was my first gift  to my country, and it is also a keepsake to me.  In 1941, when savings bonds were retitled as ‘‘war bonds’’ in the terrible  and devastating aftermath of Pearl  Harbor, the United States rallied as a  collective nation in support of the war  and war bond  effort. At  the  time,  though,  the average American only  earned about  $2,000 a year. Despite  these hardships and tough times, 134  million Americans were called on to be  part of the war bond effort, and more  than half of the U.S. population—85  million people—responded to the patriotic call to participate.  The Scouts raised money and personally donated their own funds 10 cents  at a time in the form of stamps that  could be pasted into a war bond booklet. When war bond books were complete, they could be taken to the local  bank, and sometimes even the  local  post office, to purchase bonds. One innovative group even created a promotional cardboard with slots for 75  quarters that had to be filled before it  could be redeemed for a bond.  Showing his leadership and dedication to the effort, President Franklin  Delano Roosevelt purchased the very  first war bond issued. In part of President Roosevelt’s April 30, 1941, radio  address  to  the American people, he  said:  One thought is uppermost in my mind as I  make grateful acknowledgment of this dual  honor. It is that in reserving the first Defense Savings Bond and the  first Defense  Postal Savings Stamps in the name of the  President, the Secretary of the Treasury and  the Postmaster General have given emphasis  to the national character of this defense savings campaign. This character of the campaign is national in the best sense of the  word, for it is going to reach down, we hope,  to the individual and the family in every  community and on every  farm,  in every  State and every possession of the United  States.  The President goes on to say:  It is national and it is homey at the same  time. For example, I am buying not one  stamp but ten stamps each to go into a little  book for each of my ten grandchildren. And  the first savings bond is being made out in  the name of Mrs. Roosevelt as beneficiary.  It is fitting that the President in his purchases should be a sort of a symbol of the determination of all the people to save and sacrifice in defense of democracy. In a larger  sense, this first defense bond and these first  defense stamps sold to the President constitute tangible evidence of a partnership—a  partnership between all of the people and  their Government—entered into to safeguard  and perpetuate all of those precious freedoms  which Government guarantees. In this time  of national peril, what we all must realize is  that the United States Government is you  and I and all other families next door all the  way across the country and back again. It is  one great partnership.  That ends the quote from President  Roosevelt.

953,157,2011-11-18,Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to congratulate Liberia on the completion of  its second peaceful and democratic  election. On November 15th, Liberia’s National  Elections Commission certified President Ellen  Johnson Sirleaf of  the Unity Party as  the  President of the Republic of Liberia. The November 15 declaration followed a Presidential  run-off election on November 8, which was required by the Liberian Constitution as no candidate received a majority of votes in the first  round held on October 11.  I was encouraged by reports that the Liberian election process was deemed  free,  fair  and transparent by some 4,800 domestic and  international observers. The role that the African Union (AU), the Economic Community of  West African States, ECOWAS,  the Carter  Center and other institutions played was crucial  in providing additional confidence  in  the  process. I applaud the UN Mission in Liberia  for providing a safe and secure environment in  which voters were able  to cast  their ballots  without incident on both October 11 and November 8. Furthermore, I applaud the Liberian  people on demonstrating their commitment to  peace and democracy.  I congratulate President Johnson Sirleaf and  the newly elected members of  the National  Legislature, and I hope that they will work together to continue along the path to progress,  peace, and prosperity that Liberia has already  taken. At the same time, I express my deep  regret over the decision of the Congress for  Democratic Change, CDC, to boycott the runoff election based upon unproven allegations  that  the election process was  fraudulent.  I  concur  in  the  sentiments  expressed  by  ECOWAS, the AU and the Carter Center that  the CDC boycott deprived the people of Liberia of a dynamic vote in the runoff and created  a climate of intimidation and fear in the country.  I was saddened by the violent protest that  erupted on November 7, the eve of Liberia’s  runoff election, and I mourn the lives lost on  that day, which will remain a shadow cast over  an otherwise peaceful and democratic process.  I’m  pleased  by  President  Johnson  Sirleaf’s efforts to set up an independent commission to investigate the incident and bring  those responsible  to  justice.  I  firmly believe  that  reconciliation  is essential  to  create a  sense of national unity and purpose, and I call  upon all political party leaders and their supporters to recognize the certified results of the  Presidential and Legislative contests.  The United States will hold accountable any  and all political  leaders and  their supporters  seeking to undermine Liberia’s peace and democracy by all means available, including the  possible use of multilateral and bilateral sanctions.  It is now more important than ever that the  United States continue to work with Liberia’s  elected leaders and stand by the Liberian people as  they move  to complete  their  journey  into post-conflict success, and sustain the path  f  TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF MR.

954,157,2011-11-18,Mr. PAYNE.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor the memory of Mr. Benjamin Hickman  Wright, Senior who passed away on April 12,  2011. His beloved family is holding a memorial  service on November 23, 2011. Throughout  his lifetime, Mr. Wright exemplified the highest  traits of fidelity to his country and family in a  manner truly deserving of this great honor. Mr.  Wright was an individual who came from a lineage that strove for excellence in all facets of  their work. Over a lifetime of achievement and  service  to others, Mr. Wright embodied  the  ideals of hard work and dedication to his community, which is the bedrock of American values.  Mr. Wright was an individual who realized  significant achievements  throughout his  life.  This can be traced back to his family who attained advanced degrees in the early twentieth  century. In fact Mr. Wright’s grandfather and  great uncle were  the  first African American  physicians in Ohio. Mr. Wright’s father was a  top ranking life insurance salesman who also  gave back  to his  community by  teaching  sharecroppers how  to  read, write and calculate the price of their produce and goods.  After receiving a stellar education, Mr. Wright  served in the armed forces during World War  II in the European Theater as a First Class  Petty Officer of  the United States Navy. He  was recently honored for his service with an  Armed Forces Citation signed by President  Obama.  From one generation to the next, it is evident that the Wright family has attained significant accomplishments and  remained  committed to excellence in their work. Mr. Wright  maintained and advanced  this work  through  his many accomplishments including his service in the military followed by his service as an  Economic Advisor  in Monrovia, Liberia. Mr.  Wright would go on  to become a business  owner and an employee in several fortune 500  companies. By the 1980’s he founded a nationwide coalition of civic and fraternal associations  that served  to empower and up  lift  others.  His commitment  to serving his community  and country and his accomplishments benefited and enhanced the lives of many citizens  over several decades. His memory and work  will be remembered by a grateful nation and I  am pleased  to add my voice as his  family  celebrates his legacy.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE CITY OF RIALTO’S CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION  HON. JOE BACA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2011  ",2011
955,157,2011-11-18,Mr. BACA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask  Congress to join me in celebrating the City of  Rialto’s 100th Birthday. Rialto has a long, rich  history, and has grown into a city that is home  to over 100,000 people. I have been fortunate  enough  to  raise my  family  in Rialto.  I am  proud to live in this city, represent these people, and join them in celebrating this momentous event.  Ancient artifacts and traces of a village indicate that Native Americans inhabited this area  between 1500 AD and 1800 AD. What happened to these people and settlements still remains a mystery. In 1769, the King of Spain  awarded areas of Rialto as  land grants  to  Spanish Dons. Following the cession of California to the United States, Mormons became  the  next  wave  of  settlers  in  the  San  Bernardino valley. By 1854 some of  these  early pioneers settled  in Rialto, constructing  ranches and farms in their wake. This period  gave birth  to  the  international distribution of  Muscat Grapes and the building of the oldest  structure in Rialto.  The Semi Tropic Land and Water Company  purchased 25,000 acres of land in 1887. The  company helped develop and  christen  the  town site. Hattie Merrill, daughter of the former  Governor of Iowa, Samuel Merrill, named the  town site after  the Rialto Bridge  in Venice,  Italy. Within  the same year, a railroad connector line was constructed in Rialto. Towns  were located every 2,600 yards along the line,  connecting  Rialto  to  towns  from  San  Bernardino to Pasadena. That year alone over  25 new  towns were built. During  the same  year, a group of Methodists settled in Rialto.  They originally came  to build a college, but  soon began to grow citrus in the beautiful climate of Rialto. Their farms quickly expanded  to acres of citrus groves. In 1888, the Brooke  School was built to educate the growing population. Many credit this group of Methodists for  developing the Town of Rialto.  By the late 1800s, Rialto became home to  a blacksmith, lumber yard, and a cement pipe  manufacturing company. The first citrus association was established, and  the  first citrus  packing house was built. Rialto’s reputation for  beautiful homes with shaded drives began to  grow, and so did the population. In 1891, the  Rialto School District was formed, and in 1907  the Chamber of Commerce was established.  Over the next four years, the population grew  to the point that the town supported 40 businesses and a newspaper. In 1911, Rialto was  officially incorporated as a City.  For many years thereafter, the City of Rialto  continued  to grow, shipping citrus  to every  area in the country. Today those train tracks  still run through the City, but are used on a  much smaller scale—the area has matured  and modernized. Throughout these changes,  Rialto remains a great place to raise a family.  My children grew up attending school and  playing sports  in  the area.  I am honored  to  have had the opportunity to serve this community both at the local and national level. My  son, Joe Baca, Jr. still lives in Rialto and has  the opportunity to serve our community as a  City Council Member. On behalf of my wife,  Barbara, and my children, Councilman Joe  Baca Jr., Jeremy, Natalie, and Jennifer, we  would like to join our neighbors in celebrating  Rialto’s 100th birthday.

956,165,2011-11-18,Mr. SCHILLING.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize National Adoption Day and to celebrate the many families who graciously open  their homes and their lives to the most vulnerable and often forgotten children in our communities. As the father of 10 children I understand the importance of family, I also understand  the many sacrifices parents make  to  provide  the best opportunities  for  their kids.  This is why I deeply respect adoptive and foster parents; they so readily take on additional  expenses and sacrifices  to provide a safe  home for a child.  I recently joined the Congressional Caucus  on Foster Care which  is dedicated  to protecting and promoting the welfare of the more  than 424,000 children who are part of the foster care system in the U.S. The Caucus provides a forum where Members can come together to discuss ways we can improve the  system and help these children make a successful transition out of care and into society.  Tomorrow, National Adoption Day will be  celebrated across the country. There are more  than 400 events planned to highlight the need  for more families to open their hearts to children in need and to show gratitude to those  who have  taken  that step.  I want  to  thank  each and every  foster parent and adoptive  parent for opening your safe and loving home  to a child. Thank you for taking the time to enrich the lives of those children who need it the  most.  f  ON THE OCCASION OF MARY LOUISE  PETERS-HUGHES’  100th  BIRTHDAY  HON. GARY C. PETERS  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2011  ",2011
957,165,2011-11-18,Mr. PETERS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today for  the most special purpose and privilege of honoring the life of Mary Louise Peters-Hughes on  the occasion of her 100th birthday.  Mary Louise Peters-Hughes  is a most remarkable woman, having  lived  through 100  years of the most changeable times in human  history; she is also my aunt, big sister to my  late father Herb, and the matriarch of our family.  Born on September 20, 1911, Mary came of  age amidst  the burgeoning era of women’s  rights. Her achievements embodied the kind of  progress and  leadership envisioned by  that  movement; throughout her life, Mary has held  herself to a high standard of achievement and  leadership.  In 1929, she graduated valedictorian  from  Rochester High School, after serving  in  the  National Honor Society and as president of  her senior class. Mary matriculated  to Alma  College, during a  time when only 10% of  young people sought higher education. Mary  studied English and Latin and continued to be  a leader among her peers by serving as President of the Wright Ladies Hall and member of  the Philamathion Ladies Social Society. Within  four years, she graduated with a near-perfect  grade point average. Finally, before embarking  upon a career in teaching, Aunt Mary obtained  her Master’s Degree  from  the University of  Michigan.  Aunt Mary was a devoted teacher, always  encouraging her students  to  fulfill  their best  potentials. She did the same with family, too.  Ever the supportive big sister, she sent my father money every week as he worked to get  his own degree  from her alma mater, Alma  College. My  father often  talked of his deep  gratitude  for her vital support of him during  those  lean depression. After marrying my  uncle, Halley Hughes, Mary took a leave from  her career and devoted herself  full  time  to  family and raising her three sons: Bob, Dick,  and Jim.  Later in life, Aunt Mary returned to her beloved career and for another 21 years. And as  a passionate educator, Aunt Mary joined both  the National Education Association and Delta  Kappa Gamma  to enhance  the status and  fight  for  the  rights of her  fellow  teachers  across Michigan and the Nation.  Mr. Speaker,  though she  is my beloved  aunt, by any objective measure Mary Louise  Peters-Hughes has  lived an exceptional  life,  marked by academic excellence, an admirable  professional career and a most compassionate  and strong family life. Her story and path is  truly one we can all look to as an example for  our own  lives.  I, my wife and children and  Mary’s  three children, six grandchildren and  nine great grandchildren are grateful  for  the  100 years she has lived and the lessons and  love she has shared with each of us. We wish  for many more lived in health and happiness.  f  CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2112,  CONSOLIDATED  AND  FURTHER  CONTINUING  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT, 2012  SPEECHOF  HON. RUSH D. HOLT  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 17, 2011  ",2011
958,165,2011-11-18,Mr. HOLT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Year 2012 Conference report  for  the  Agriculture,  Commerce-Justice-  Science, and Transportation-HUD appropriations bill.  However, I regret the process that brought  this bill to the floor. A full one third of this bill,  the Transportation-HUD appropriations, has  never been considered by the House before.  This bill was not written in an open process  and members were  not  allowed  to  offer  amendments to improve the bill.  I am pleased that this bill included the funding I fought for to help our local residents recover and  rebuild  from  the  flooding which  caused so much destruction  in New Jersey.  This bill provides $2.3 billion in needed disaster assistance to ensure Central New Jersey’s businesses and home owners have the  resources they need to mitigate the damage  and put in place preventive measures in advance of future disasters.  Further,  this bill rejects  the dangerous attempt by House Republicans to end the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and  provides the program with almost $200 million  to help  local police departments keep our  communities safe despite  the  local budget  constraints. While this represents a steep cut  in funding from last year, these funds will help  some  local departments who are having  to  make tough decisions about firing police officers for a lack of resources. Going forward,  we must do far more to get more cops back  on the beat.  In these difficult times, this bill also denies  an attempt to reduce funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)  and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC).  SNAP and WIC help our  fellow Americans  during their most difficult times with some food  assistance to help make ends meet. As millions of our fellow Americans are struggling in  this difficult economy, this bill provides $105  billion for domestic food assistance programs,  an 18 percent  increase  from  last year,  to  make sure they are at least able to keep some  food on the table.  As a research scientist,  I have  long supported the important role of federal investment  in basic research. I am glad this bill increases  funding  for  the National Science Foundation  (NSF) to $7 billion, an increase of $173 million. It also provides the necessary funding to  continue the development of the James Webb  Space Telescope that will allow researchers to  find  the  first galaxies and help create  jobs  now. Further, this bill provides the U.S. Patent  and Trademark Office a 29 percent increase in  funding to ensure that our Nation’s inventors  are able to get their ideas to market and help  grow our economy.  I am also pleased that this bill makes needed changes to ensure that the maximum loan  limits for the Federal Housing Administration  are maintained at a level necessary for areas  with high cost housing like we have in New  Jersey. With  the housing market still weak,  this will help provide some necessary stability  and support for prospective home owners.  It is unfortunate that this bill freezes funding  for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission which is tasked with implementing many  of the commonsense Wall Street reforms we  approved last year. Without additional funding  the CFTC will struggle to prevent future financial crises, and not have the resources needed to fight oil speculation which is increasing  the cost of gas at the pump.  Finally, I regret that this bill contains a number of funding restrictions that will limit our Nation’s law enforcement officers from combating  gun  trafficking and prevent sensible  regulations from being established to prevent guns  from  falling  into  the hands of criminals. Yet  again  the NRA has been given an early  Christmas present with the inclusion of these  special giveaways tucked into this bill without  a vote or any debate on them.  This is not a perfect bill but it prevents a  looming government shutdown. Further, it provides funding increases for a number of critical  programs and rejects many of the dangerous  cuts contained  in  the  funding bills  that  the  House previously approved. I support passage  of this bill despite its pessimistic view of what  America can achieve through ambitious funding of the programs covered under the bill.

960,6,2011-12-06,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," Madam  Speaker, today I rise to honor Martina  Correia, who  passed  away  recently  from breast cancer. Martina was a courageous  and  inspiring woman who  proved what President Obama  has  often said, ‘‘In the face of impossible  odds, people who love this country can  change  it.’’  For  decades, Martina  fought for human rights in defense of  her brother, who was  sentenced  to  death based on unreliable eyewitness  testimony  that was  later  recanted.  Martina’s  brother,  Troy  Anthony  Davis, was on death row for 20 years  until his execution this year.  Thanks  to Martina, people  rallied  around Troy’s case and began to really  think about how it is that a society  such as ours can execute a potentially  innocent man. Inspired by Martina, a  diverse array of men and women in the  United States and  from around  the  world,  people  like Amnesty  International’s Laura Moye; NAACP President Ben Jealous; Reverend Raphael  Warnock, pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church where the reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once  pastored; British MP Alistair Carmichael; former President Jimmy Carter; Pope Benedict XVIth; and a large  group of other distinguished  leaders  from around the world whose names  are too numerous for me to recognize  at this time. These folks banded together  to  fight  for Troy Anthony  Davis’ life.  From her humble roots in Georgia,  Martina  led  this  international campaign to save her brother and prove his  innocence. Martina advocated for justice and fought to save her brother’s  life. And  in so doing, she became a  death penalty abolitionist in the movement to move America to renounce and  abolish the death penalty, whereupon  America could finally join the ranks of  the other industrialized nations of the  world that have barred the use of this  barbaric form of punishment.  She became an international human  rights advocate, and it will, in part, be  due to her efforts that we will one day  cheer the abolition of the death penalty in this country. I will remember  and thank Martina when we reach that  milestone in our development as a Nation and as a people.  Martina  fought this battle  for her  brother while fighting her own battle  with breast cancer. You see, she was diagnosed with breast cancer 11 years  ago, and at that time, she was given 6  months to live. She beat the odds and  fought to stay alive so that she could  fight for her brother. Before her diagnosis, Martina was a nurse, and she was  also a veteran who served her country  in the 1992 Gulf war.  Martina’s  illness eventually  forced  her to stop working for a living, but  she continued to advocate for what was  important to her. In addition to her  work on behalf of her brother, Martina  also was a leader of the National Black  Leadership Initiative on Cancer, where  she advocated for a cure. Her mother,  Virginia Davis, died in April 2011 shortly after her son, Troy Anthony Davis,  suffered defeat on his appeal. Martina  is survived by one son, Antone De’Juan  Davis-Correia;  two  sisters, Kimberly  and Ebony Davis; and one brother, Lester Davis.  It was an honor  for me to know  Martina and an honor for me to meet  her mother and an honor for me to  meet her brother.  I’m comforted  in  knowing that she will reunite with her  dear mother and with her brother,  Troy, as their lives are linked for all  eternity.  Strong and fearless, fighting to the  very end without giving up or giving  in, she fought a great fight. And now  it’s  time  to  rest  for  a  little  bit,  Martina. You rest in peace. But rest  knowing that the movement to abolish  the death penalty will continue, and  with your example at the top of our  minds, we will never give up until the  job is done.  f  b1050  TAKING ON CURRENCY  MANIPULATORS  ",2011
961,6,2011-12-06,The SPEAKER  pro  tempore., The  Chair recognizes the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. DONNELLY) for 5 minutes.  ,2011
962,6,2011-12-06,Mr. DONNELLY of Indiana.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today because it has  been weeks since the bipartisan majority in the Senate passed legislation to  take on currency manipulators. Weeks  have passed, and House leadership has  refused to allow a stand-alone up-or-  down vote on currency manipulation  legislation right here in the House of  Representatives. Legislators from both  sides of the aisle talk about the importance of creating jobs every day. Why  wouldn’t we take this opportunity to  work together to not only create jobs  but to also protect the good-paying  jobs we already have here in America?  Recently, the Peterson Institute for  International  Economics  concluded  that China’s currency is undervalued  by 24 percent against the dollar. That  means that America’s manufacturers  are competing with Chinese manufacturers who are enjoying a permanent 24  percent off sale. Isn’t it time to do  something about these problems, problems that are damaging the U.S. economy, and to stand up  for American  manufacturers?  When countries are allowed to keep  the values of their currencies artificially low and, in turn, the price of  their exports into the United States,  American companies face an unfair disadvantage. American  companies  are  currently playing on an unlevel playing field where their competitors are  able to maintain a permanent sale on  all the products they sell. As our trade  deficit  increases with countries  like  China, we lose American jobs. In fact,  the Economic Policy Institute released  a study this fall showing that, between  2001 and 2010, the U.S. lost 2.8 million  jobs, including nearly 62,000 jobs in my  own State of Indiana, as a result of the  expanding trade deficit with China.  The Senate has already acted on this  issue. It passed the Currency Exchange  Rate Oversight Reform Act in October.  The passage of this bill assures that  correcting unfair trade practices is not  a Democrat or a Republican  issue—  rather, it’s an American priority. Sixteen Republican Senators  joined  47  Democrat Senators in voting for this  bill to counter the currency manipulation that is damaging our economic recovery. In a time of too much partisan  bickering, we need to take the opportunity to work together and stand up  for American businesses and American  workers. That’s what we were sent here  to do.  In addition to the Senate-passed bill,  we have a piece of legislation, which is  waiting for a vote right here in the  House, with 225 cosponsors of both Republicans and Democrats. That’s more  than a majority. The Currency Reform  for Fair Trade Act would allow the Department of Commerce to counter imports, made cheaper by currency manipulation, with a corresponding tariff.  A  nearly  identical  bill  passed  the  House  last year with 348 votes. The  support is here. We just need to take  this vote.  When I travel around north central  Indiana, I often hear from small businesses and manufacturers on this issue,  and they never ask that Congress guarantee their success. They simply ask  for a level playing field and to have the  rules the same for everybody. All they  want is a fair fight.  So, today, I echo my request from 2  months ago to the House leadership: It  is time. It is time for bipartisan legislation that addresses currency manipulation and to have a vote on it here in  the House of Representatives—a stand-  alone up-or-down vote.  As I said then and as I’ll say again to  our House  leadership: Who  do you  stand with, the Chinese Government or  the American workers? It is time to  stand up for our country—for all of the  people who work in our country and for  all of our citizens. Let’s have a vote.  f  SMART SECURITY: A BETTER  INVESTMENT THAN  10 YEARS OF  WAR IN AFGHANISTAN  ",2011

966,14,2011-12-06,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Speaker, while  this body wastes its time debating yet  another bill that does nothing to create jobs or help the middle class, the  American people are looking for action  from us. We need to stop supporting  handouts for wealthy corporations and  pass an extension of the payroll tax  and  unemployment  benefits  immediately.  Despite  saying  for months,  if not  years, that tax cuts are their most important  priority,  the majority  has  failed to act on a critical extension of  the payroll tax, even though it would  save  the  average American  family  $1,500 a year; 400,000 jobs will be lost if  we do not pass this payroll tax extension.  The majority has also failed to act on  extending  unemployment  insurance  benefits,  even  though UI has kept  900,000 kids out of poverty last year. In  fact, the number of Americans in poverty would have doubled last year if  the unemployment insurance benefits  had not been extended. And at least  200,000 jobs will be lost if the majority  blocks an extension of benefits.  But instead of acting on these two  important priorities, what does the Republican majority spend its time on?  We have seen them protect wasteful  tax breaks for corporate jet and race  horse owners, corporate subsidies for  Big Agriculture, Big Oil, special tax  treatment for Wall Street millionaires  and billionaires, and now  this misguided bill, which would undermine our  regulatory system to the detriment of  everything  from  food safety to protecting the environment without doing  anything to create jobs.  Time and again, the majority has  shown that they will go to any lengths  to side with the wealthiest 1 percent of  Americans, while turning their backs  on middle class and working families.  To take one more example, this past  week Democrats introduced a payroll  tax cut for 160 million people, offset by  raising taxes on 350,000 millionaires.  But the Republican majority instead  put forward a package that would slash  the Federal workforce, raise Medicare  premiums,  curtail  the  social  safety  nets.  Instead  of  just  having America’s  wealthiest families pay their fair share  of taxes, the majority would rather see  more lost public jobs and less support  for middle class families, all in order to  continue a tax cut that independent  economists agree  is critical  for our  economy.  Keep in mind the Republican mantra  in recent memory has always been that  tax cuts never, never need to be offset.  And a year ago they said the same of a  payroll tax cut. They’ve now changed  their tune.  American  families  deserve  better  leadership than this. Right now, Congress should be doing everything in its  power  to  create  jobs,  rebuild  our  schools and infrastructure, support our  small  businesses,  get  our  economy  moving again. That means passing an  extension and expansion of the payroll  tax cut; that means passing an extension of the unemployment  insurance  benefits.  Working to create  jobs, that’s our  job. We do not have the  luxury to  waste America’s time catering to the  wealthiest interests in our society and  considering ill-conceived bills such as  this one.  ",2011

I think it’s  a silly idea to sign such a thing, but  most have done that.  Yet it does seem that when it comes  to middle class tax cuts, there’s this  little hesitation going on. Do we really  mean  cutting  taxes  for  the middle  class? Do we mean preserving tax cuts  for the middle class? Or are we just  talking about the wealthiest Americans?  Right now, if we don’t move ahead  with extending the payroll tax cut,  that’s what most, that’s what all working families pay, their payroll taxes.  You know, we hear, oh, the wealthy,  that the wealthy are paying all the income taxes. Yeah, most people would  like to pay  income taxes. But they  definitely pay payroll taxes if they’re  working. And they’re risking 160 million Americans who would not get tax  relief if we don’t extend the payroll tax  cut for working families.  So we need to do that before we  leave. But, instead, we’re talking about  some way to stop any kind of regulations, further health and safety regulations, making it hard to do that.  I got a letter from someone talking  about  the  unemployment  insurance  and extending those benefits. He says,  this is from John, in my district: ‘‘I’m  a Desert Storm Veteran and lost my  job October 21, 2010. I’ve been drawing  unemployment and am now on  extended unemployment benefits. I, like  millions of Americans, would rather be  working 80 hours a week if possible.  The job market is scary, but what’s  worse is the thought that we might be  without that last bit of a safety net  come the end of December.’’  ",2011

972,14,2011-12-06,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," John continued:  ‘‘These benefits for many is the difference between having a  roof over  your head and living on the streets.’’  He says: ‘‘I just hope you can encourage your fellow House Members to put  the livelihood of millions of Americans  above their petty politics.’’  Above the petty politics. That’s what  we’re facing right now. If we extend unemployment  insurance  benefits,  it’s  not just good for John and his family;  it’s not just good for the hundreds of  thousands of people that would  lose  their  unemployment  benefits  over  500,000 in January. It is also good for  the economy. Every dollar generates a  $1.52 in economic activity in the country.  These are the things that the American people at this holiday season are  worrying about, are afraid of. He calls  it scary. He’s afraid. And we’re dealing  with this pettiness right now. Let’s get  over it and on with the business of the  people.  ",2011

974,14,2011-12-06,Mr. BISHOP of Utah.," I thank you for  the time.  Mr. Speaker, I will apologize in advance  for actually  talking on  topic  here.  In 1791, the Second Session of Congress, John Page was a Congressman  from Virginia, and he objected to his  peers who wanted to leave and let the  designation of postal routes be left to  the President. They trusted the President, justifiably, but John Page threatened his colleagues by saying that if we  do so he will move to adjourn and leave  all the objects of  legislation to the  President’s sole consideration and direction.  b1310  Now, the issue at hand back in 1791  was not necessarily what roads and  routes should be taken, even though  they did have an economic impact. The  issue was who should designate those  routes because every rule and regulation  is, by definition, a  legislative  function. It is not a function of the administration that should be given to  the President or the bureaucracies that  are created because of it. It is a congressional function. But we do not take  the time to make the details in our  particular piece of  legislation. When  we simply ask in our legislation that a  Secretary in a department shall have  the power to write rules and regulations and then leave it at that, we are  abrogating our responsibility.  ‘‘Country of origin’’ labeling sounded  like a great idea. We should know if we  are buying American beef. Even though  it was passed before I became a Member of Congress, it was my eighth year  in Congress before they were able to  write the rules because Congress did  not take the time and effort to go  through the details of understanding  what we were doing when we are passing legislation.

Simply put, we must  always be prepared.  I would urge the strong support of  H.R. 2405.  ",2011
976,22,2011-12-06,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  such time as he may consume to one of  the authors of the bill, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN).  ",2011
977,22,2011-12-06,Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, as a personal aside, this probably won’t be the headline on the 6  o’clock news tonight around the country because we’re actually agreeing on  something, and I think I can associate  myself with the remarks of my colleague, the primary sponsor of this bill,  as well as he could associate with  mine, Mr. PALLONE, and ",2011
978,22,2011-12-06,Mr. PITTS.,"  But I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 2405, the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act  of 2011, which will reauthorize certain  provisions of the Project BioShield Act  of 2004 and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006, and I’m  proud to be an original cosponsor of  this legislation.  This legislation was initially passed  by Congress to help the U.S. develop  medical  countermeasures  against  chemical, biological, radiological, and  nuclear terrorism agents to provide a  mechanism for Federal acquisition of  these  newly  developed  countermeasures.  Our Nation  remains vulnerable  to  these threats because many of the vaccines and medicines that are needed to  protect our citizens do not exist. Developing and stockpiling these medical  countermeasures  require  time,  resources and research, all of which will  be provided under this legislation before us today.  As my colleague from Michigan said,  it may not be the bestseller on the  market, like so many other pharmaceuticals, but this is something that  our country needs.  H.R. 2405 is important to me because  the  University  of  Texas  Medical  Branch-Galveston National Laboratory  is literally in the backyard of our congressional district. The Galveston National Lab is the only BSL–4 lab located on a university campus.  At the lab, the scientists conduct research and develop therapies, vaccines,  and diagnostic tests for naturally-occurring  emerging  diseases  such  as  SARS and avian influenza, as well as  for microbes that may be employed by  terrorists.  This is exactly the type of research  we hope to encourage under the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness  Reauthorization Act. As an original cosponsor of H.R. 2405 with Mr. ROGERS,  I’m really pleased with how quickly we  moved this rare bipartisan piece of legislation. I want to thank Mr. ROGERS,  Chairman UPTON, Ranking Member  and Ranking Member PALLONE, along with  the  chair of our  Health Subcommittee, Mr. PITTS, Mrs.  MYRICK, Ms. ESHOO, and Mr. MARKEY  for their work on H.R. 2405.

One of the results of a slack economy  is that more individuals and businesses  have filed for bankruptcy. In fact, over  the past 3 years, the number of bankruptcy petitions  filed  in bankruptcy  courts has doubled. While recent data  show that the volume of cases is beginning to subside, our bankruptcy judges  remain hard at work.  Bankruptcy judges are critical to the  operation of our Federal bankruptcy  courts. The important bankruptcy reforms Congress passed in 2005, for example, called on judges to do more to  help prevent bankruptcy abuse; and  large, complex chapter 11 cases, like  the recently filed mega-case of American Airline, are time intensive for our  bankruptcy judges.  In the last Congress, the Judiciary  Committee  reported  a  bankruptcy  judgeships bill that would have created  new permanent judgeships, converted  temporary  judgeships  to  permanent  status, and extended temporary judgeships. The House passed that bill, but  it did not pass the Senate.  As a result, several temporary judgeships are in danger of being unable to  be refilled if there is a vacancy. But  the need  for bankruptcy  judges  remains high.  I  introduced  the  legislation under  consideration with the ranking member of the Courts, Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee of the  Judiciary Committee, STEVE the chairman of that subcommittee,  HOWARDCOBLE, and the ranking member of the full Judiciary Committee,  COHEN,  JOHNCONYERS.  This bill permits 23 temporary bankruptcy judgeships in judicial districts  throughout the country to be filled if  there is a judgeship vacancy in those  districts during the next 5 years as a  result of a judge’s death, removal, retirement, or resignation.  Congress  should  ensure  there  are  enough bankruptcy  judges to handle  the increased caseloads as a result of  the recession; but Congress should also  conserve Federal resources and conduct  periodic oversight of judicial caseloads.  H.R. 1021 authorizes a 5-year extension,  which preserves Congress’s ability to  reassess  the  need  for  bankruptcy  judges in a few years.  Time is of the essence. I urge the  Senate also  to act quickly on  this  measure so that our bankruptcy system may  continue  to operate with  speed and efficiency.  I want to thank the bill’s cosponsors  for their bipartisan support.  One of the results of the slack economy is  that more  individuals and businesses have  filed  for bankruptcy.

And  large, complex chapter 11 cases, like the recently  filed mega-case of American Airlines,  are time-intensive for our bankruptcy judges.  However, no new bankruptcy  judgeships  have been created since 2005. At that time,  Congress created  temporary  judgeships so  that it could periodically review the caseloads  in each district and assess whether the temporary judgeship was still needed. Permanent  judgeships have not been authorized since  1992.  Every two years, the Judicial Conference of  the United States publishes a report to Congress that details the judicial needs of each  district. The Conference evaluates need based  on a ‘‘weighted caseload’’ analysis. The 2011  weighted caseload statistics demonstrate that  judges are desperately needed in many districts.  In  the  last Congress,  the Judiciary Committee  reported a bankruptcy  judgeships bill  that would  have  created  new  permanent  judgeships, converted temporary judgeships to  permanent  status and extended  temporary  judgeships. The House passed that bill but it  did not pass the Senate.  As a result, several  temporary  judgeships  are in danger of being unable to be refilled if  there  is a vacancy.

H.R. 1021 authorizes a 5-year  extension, which preserves Congress’s ability  to reassess the need for bankruptcy judges in  a few years.  The relief a debtor receives from the bankruptcy system is extraordinary; they either reorganize their debts on more favorable terms  or they get a complete discharge of all their  prepetition debts. All except  the poorest of  debtors pay a fee to file a bankruptcy case  and receive these benefits.  I believe it is fair to use debtors’ filing fees  to pay for the costs associated with our bankruptcy  judges. This  legislation, as amended,  raises the filing fee on chapter 11 reorganization cases from $1000 to $1042—a modest 4  percent increase. As a result, this bill does not  increase direct spending by the federal government.  Time is of the essence. I urge the Senate  also to act quickly on this measure so that our  bankruptcy system may continue  to operate  with speed and efficiency.  I thank the bill’s cosponsors for their bipartisan support.  HOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES,  COMMITTEEONWAYSANDMEANS,  Washington, DC, December 5, 2011.  Hon.

S. 1541, the Senate version of H.R.  2815, is another bipartisan bill to revise  the Federal charter of the Blue Star  Mothers of America. The revisions implemented  by  the  legislation  once  again reflect minor changes recently  made to the organization’s membership  eligibility requirements.  The Blue Star Mothers of America,  representing the mothers of military  servicemen and  -women, has been a  federally chartered organization since  1960. The  existing  charter  restricts  member in three ways:  A, members must be birth mothers,  adoptive mothers,  or  certain  stepmothers;  B, members must be U.S. citizens  currently living in the country; and  C, the corresponding serviceman or  -woman must be currently serving in  the Armed Forces or must have served  in World War II or the Korean War.  Last year, at the organization’s national convention, the group adopted a  resolution expanding these eligibility  criteria. A conforming amendment to  the Federal charter is needed in order  make these changes operable.  S. 1541, the Senate bill, was introduced by Senator MICHAELBENNETof  Colorado. Its House companion was introduced by Representative SCOTTTIPTON, also of Colorado.  The  legislation makes three minor  revisions to the organization’s charter:  First, to expand the membership eligibility requirements to include foster  mothers, grandmothers,  female  legal  guardians, and all stepmothers;  Second,  it expands membership to  U.S. citizens living abroad;  Third, it expands eligibility to servicemen and -women who served in prior  conflicts other than World War II and  the Korean War.  Our men and women in the military  need all the support we can offer, so I  applaud this effort by the Blue Star  Mothers to provide the circle of support that the organization can provide.  They  do much  to  remember  our  servicepeople, and I appreciate their efforts. I support these changes, and I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011
984,38,2011-12-06,Mr. GOHMERT.," Madam Speaker, this  is also another very bipartisan bill.  The Blue Star Mothers is a wonderful  group. I have met with them and I have  wept with them. I’ve prayed for them  and am grateful  to  them  for  their  work. I’m grateful for my mother, who  passed away in 1991, as the mother of a  servicemember and my stepmother as  well, now.  What they’re asking for makes perfect sense, and I would encourage my  colleagues to support this resolution as  the Blue Star Mothers have requested.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2011

986,38,2011-12-06,Mr. COHEN.," Madam Speaker,  the  other day the Postmaster General said  that first class mail wasn’t going to be  first class anymore; it wasn’t going to  be overnight; it might be 2 or 3 days.  Because of  the problems we have  with making the post office financially  sufficient, there are ways they could  accomplish this, and I’ve got a bill that  allows them to go into other services  to  expand  their  revenue  base,  and  there’s also about $5 billion that’s an  issue  concerning  payments  into  a  health fund that could be resolved.  The post office is almost as American  as apple pie. A lot of people will switch  to using the Internet to pay their bills  and they’ll never go back to the post  office. I’m afraid that what’s been recommended  is penny-wise and pound-  foolish, and a great American institution that serves many rural people and  others without a lot of connectivity  and fortune will suffer.  I wish the Postmaster General will  reconsider his action. I have a ‘‘Dear  Colleague’’ being  circulated.

We take up a few suspension bills  here that only the Congress could deal  with, so it’s something we have to do,  we’re proud to do, important to those  organizations in two States. It’s important to them; it’s important to us.  We have people on the other side of  the aisle who come forward and try to  make  it  into a  jobs debate when  it  would seem that some of the best debate would be if all of us, en masse,  walked down to the other end of the  hall of this building and began to seek  to debate the Senate—the Senate leadership, that is—and Democratic Party  on why they are so intent on stopping  legislation that could put people back  to work.  There are many besides the President, in addition to the President, who  say this is a do-nothing Congress; and  because the Senate does so very little,  they give credence to that argument.  One need only look to all the bills we  have been passing here in the House  that could help the economy, would  help the economy, would put people  back to work, would bring down dramatically the cost of energy, which  would bring down  inflation and the  stagnation and stagflation that’s been  put in place by this President and, actually, the 2 years prior to this President when  our Democratic  friends  across  the aisle controlled Congress  and jumped up spending like we could  not have anticipated.  Our friends across the aisle correctly  pointed out that Republicans in 2006  were spending too much money. They  were right  in pointing out that we  should never be spending $160 billion  more than we were taking  in. They  were right.  As a result of their being right on  that  and  their  promises  that  they  would rein in that runaway spending,  our friends across the aisle were given  the majority in November of 2006.  b1710  What followed in 2007, 2008, 2009, and  2010 under  the Democratic majority  was runaway spending at a level never  even dreamed of, at least on our side of  the aisle.  Who would have ever dreamed that  the same party that condemned Republicans—correctly—for overspending the  amount of money coming into the Federal Treasury by $160 billion would up  that ante and overspend by 10 times  that much? Over a $1.5 trillion deficit  in just 1 year. It is just unfathomable.

You would think that we  would be  sensitive enough  to know  that families are gathering. Families  want to have a holiday for the children. They’re trying to be the Santa  that they know that the children believe in. They’re trying to make preparations. Families are trying to find  ways to be with loved ones. It may be  gasoline that they may need to drive a  car. If we don’t do this unemployment  insurance, we are poised—unlike if we  did it and we get bang for our buck—to  lose 200,000 jobs. Compound that with  not extending the payroll tax cut and  we’d lose 400,000 jobs. That is almost  600,000 jobs.  I finish by saying the tragedy of your  point about China—and I want to make  it very clear that we love all people.  We wish the best  for the people of  China. It is the policies, the currencies.  But not only do we have this in the  backdrop; we have to fix our own house  so that we’re not building a bridge in  California that has drawn steel and  workers and designers and accountants  from way across the ocean in China.  We’ve got to get our house in order.  And so 600,000—if the payroll tax cut  extension doesn’t go forward, we’re losing 400,000 jobs. And if unemployment  insurance doesn’t go forward, we’re losing 200,000 jobs. Is this the way to welcome the most sacred season for many  faiths and many families of the year of  giving, where we teach our children to  give? Is this what we should be doing  to the American people? Is this what  we should be doing to our soldiers who  will be coming home by the end of December? I think not.  I thank the gentlelady for allowing  me to share these thoughts. I’m only  looking forward to getting our house in  order and getting our holiday house in  order and reflecting on the needs of the  American people and not special interests.  ",2011

I think  just for our church it’s over 360 now for  this year. For a small congregation,  that’s a bit of a struggle. That’s just  one place, just one corner in America,  repeated in 50 States, in every hamlet.  I appreciate what the gentlelady said  about the spirit of this particular season of light and of giving and that the  people who are out of work have earned  these benefits. They’re not asking for  any handout. They’re asking for the insurance that they earned as a condition of work in order to help have a  merry Christmas and a happy Chanukah and very Eid greeting season.  They’re not asking for anything they  haven’t earned.  JOHN  KAPTUR,  for coming  I thank the gentlelady  down tonight.  Our  leader,  Congressman  GARAMENDIof California, is with us tonight.

We lit the holiday tree in  front of the Capitol. It was a tree that  came from a community very close to  where I was raised in California. I was  out there with the choir from Summerville High School in Tuolumne County,  an area that I represented for some 20  years, and then others around the area.  A beautiful, beautiful tree  from the  Stanislaus National Forest  in California.  There really is much to celebrate and  much to be concerned about in America. We are still a very great country.  We’re the strongest, wealthiest place  on this Earth. We have incredible opportunity and potential. I saw  it  in  those kids that were singing in front of  the Nation’s Capitol this evening. Yet  there’s so much pain, as was pointed  out by you and our colleague  from  Houston earlier.  Americans care about each other.  They  deeply  are  concerned  about  what’s going on in our communities,  and they want solutions to the problem. That’s our task. There’s 435 of us  here and over in the Senate another  100. And, of course, the President. It’s  our task to  find the solutions. The  President has put forth a very powerful  program called the American Jobs Act.  One piece of it has, fortunately, passed.  It was passed just a few days after Veterans Day when I guess we were out at  the parades, and we made promises to  take care of the veterans. Fortunately,  a piece of legislation did pass. Only one  part of the American Jobs Act, though  there’s much more to do.  My colleagues, Ms. KAPTUR, and the  gentlelady from Houston, we’re talking  about a piece of it. The veterans piece  provides employers a very powerful incentive to hire a veteran. A very, very  powerful  incentive. You  can  reduce  your taxes by $2,600 to hire a veteran  that’s been unemployed; a long-term  unemployed veteran, $5,600 reduction  in your taxes; and in addition to that,  the President proposed that if it is a  veteran who is disabled as a result of  their  service,  a  $9,600  reduction  in  taxes.  b1840  That’s right off the tax line. So we’ve  got to get the message out to employers: Hire, put people back to work, the  veterans. It’s one of the elements the  President has proposed in his American  Jobs Act.

992,54,2011-12-06,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Madam President,  later this week the Senate will vote on  whether the new Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau  should move  forward with a director before addressing  concerns that have been raised about  the bureau’s lack of transparency or  accountability to the American people.  I understand through press reports  that the President plans to make a big  push for this nominee to the CFPB. Let  me tell my colleagues something the  President hasn’t done when it comes to  this position: In the 7 months since 44  Republicans sent the President a letter  outlining some very serious and very  reasonable concerns about it, he hasn’t  done a  thing  to address  these concerns—not one thing. If he picked up  the phone to talk these  issues over  with  anybody  in  our  conference,  I  haven’t heard about it. If he has put  some thought into how he could ensure  the perfectly  legitimate concerns we  raised in that letter are addressed, he  hasn’t let us in on the game plan.  Here is what we asked for in that letter, which has now been signed by 45  Republican Senators—not 44, 45: All we  asked for before we vote to confirm  anybody to run the CFPB—regardless  of their party affiliation, regardless of  who the President is—are three clear,  simple,  commonsense  reforms  that  would make sure this new agency is accountable to the American people.  No. 1, replace the single director with  a board of directors that would oversee  the bureau. Under the deeply flawed  Dodd-Frank bill, the Director of the  CFPB, by design, is set to lead one of  the least accountable and most powerful agencies in Washington. What we  are saying is no single person who is  unaccountable to the American people  should have that much power. We are  asking for the same structure as the  SEC, the CFTC, the FDIC, the FTC, the  NLRB,  and  the  Consumer Product  Safety Commission—the  same  structure we use anytime we give unelected  bureaucrats new powers that need to be  checked to protect against abuse.  No. 2, subject the bureau to the congressional appropriations process. Subject this new CFPB to the congressional  appropriations  process.  Currently, the CFPB is housed at the Federal Reserve and funded through a percentage of their annual budget, giving  it a funding stream that is completely  unique in government, entirely without a check from the American people  and making it one of the least transparent agencies in Washington. If one  likes the level of accountability over  at the Fed, one will love the CFPB.  A journalist who wanted some information about the Fed’s lending practices recently had to sue to find it out.  This is information not even Congress  could have gotten on its own.  If my colleagues ask me, the American people  should be getting more  transparency out of this administration, not less. We don’t need any more  unelected,  unaccountable  czars  in  Washington.  No. 3, we asked  for a safety and  soundness check for the prudential financial  regulators who  oversee  the  safety and soundness of financial institutions. This would help ensure that we  are not  inadvertently  causing bank  failures through excessive regulations.  Our proposal would do nothing more  than give congressional committees a  proper level of oversight and accountability over this new bureau and ensure  that its decisions were subject to the  checks and balances that were meant  to be inherent in our system—something we owe the American people.  Everybody supports strong and effective  consumer  protection,  but  the  CFPB,  in  its  current  form,  cannot  stand. In its current form, the CFPB  could easily be used for political purposes at the expense of access to credit,  job creation, economic growth, and financial stability.  What is needed is transparency and  accountability. That  is all we have  asked for, and the President has done  nothing to address these concerns. Instead, he has ignored these perfectly legitimate concerns, and now he is suddenly making a push to confirm his  nominee because it fits into some picture he wants to paint about who the  good guys and the bad guys are  in  Washington.  So once again he has used the Senate  floor this week to stage a little political theater. He is setting up a vote he  knows will fail so he can show up afterward and say he is shocked. This is  what passes for leadership right now in  the White House, and it is truly unfortunate.  Look, we all believe Americans need  access to financial products that are  not rigged against them. We just think  nobody should be above oversight, including the overseers. We do not think  a bureau designed to watch Wall Street  should have the ability to squeeze out  hiring on Main Street. Frankly, the  President’s refusal to even consider our  calls  for oversight and transparency  only  serve  to  deepen  our  concerns  about this agency. So, once again, we  call on the President to take these concerns seriously and work with us on  achieving something positive.  The fact is the CFPB needs a drastic  overhaul before any nominee can be  confirmed. This will not come as a surprise to anybody at the White House,  and our doors remain open.  f  NOMINATION OF CAITLIN  HALLIGAN  ",2011

I will be opposing this nominee, and I would like to explain why.

994,70,2011-12-06,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. President, I wanted to share with the Senate  today what should be a collective outrage because an American citizen has  now been held behind bars in Cuba for  exactly 2 years.  Alan Gross was working  in Cuba  under a contract with the U.S. Agency  for International Development. He has  devoted his career to helping thousands  of people around the world, working in  development for over 25 years in more  than 50 countries.  In Cuba, Alan Gross was trying to  make a difference in the lives of people  who share his Jewish faith by bringing  them modern  communication  tools.  For that simple act, he has now languished in a Cuban prison for 2 years.  His health worsens each day and his  family, of course, misses him. His wife  Judy spoke to him just days ago and  said that Alan sounded ‘‘more hopeless  and more depressed,’’ as one would expect.  The release of Alan Gross must remain front and center in any discussion with or about the Cuban regime.  That is why many of us in this Chamber have joined in writing to the Ambassador of Cuba here—and since we  don’t have diplomatic relations, that  individual is called the Chief of the  Cuban  Interests Section—and asking  the Castro regime to immediately and  unconditionally release Alan Gross as a  humanitarian gesture and a sign of  compassion  for his  family. We have  been met, however, with stonewalling  silence.  While we remember Mr. Gross and we  keep pressure on the Castro regime,  the Senate must also fulfill its duties  toward the rest of the Western Hemisphere. A case in point: Four countries  in Latin America—Venezuela, Bolivia,  Nicaragua, and Ecuador—are currently  without a U.S. Ambassador. That is the  job of the Senate—to confirm appointments of the President. In the case of  Venezuela, it is not because we don’t  have a nominee, it is because, in fact,  we are having some trouble with the  Chavez  government. We  have  been  without  an Assistant  Secretary  of  State for Western Hemisphere Affairs  since July. It isn’t in the interest of  the United States not to have these  people in place.  The Senate has basically 2 weeks to  go  if we get out a week before the  Christmas holiday—and that is an ‘‘if,’’  by the way. During this time, while we  go through all of what we have to do in  the next 10 legislative days—such as  solving the doctors problem, extending  this payroll  tax cut, appropriations  bills, extending unemployment compensation for people who desperately  need it, and extending a lot of the tax  extenders—we must also fulfill our constitutional duty to consider these important Presidential appointments.  There is one in front of the Senate  right now; that is, the Ambassador to  El Salvador. Mari Carmen Aponte is  the U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador.  She is well known all over the United  States in Hispanic circles because she  has held, as a Foreign Service officer, a  number of posts. During the August  2010 congressional recess, the President  named her Ambassador to El Salvador.  That recess appointment is going to expire at the end of this year.  Before joining the State Department,  Ms. Aponte served as Executive Director of the Puerto Rican Federal Affairs  Administration and president of the  very respected Hispanic National Bar  Association.  Typical of the sentiment in Florida,  an editorial in a recent Miami Herald  editorial expressed support for her confirmation, saying that ‘‘her diplomatic  success has earned her the unprecedented support of the private sector  and of the most prominent political  leaders in El Salvador.’’ It was unprecedented that three former Presidents of  El Salvador came all the way to Washington to show their support during her  nomination hearing.  My wife Grace and I were recently  visited by the First Lady of El Salvador. She pointed out all of the terrible events that have taken place in  her country: struggling to recover from  the tropical depression that made landfall this past fall, the heavy rains that  have caused major damage throughout  Central America, and the 70,000 Salvadorans still living in shelters. That little country faces many challenges. So  if for no other reason than those I mentioned, we do not want to continue into  next year without our having an ambassador there. We need to confirm Ms.  Aponte as soon as possible so that she  can continue exercising the necessary  U.S. leadership.  Latin American countries continue  to be America’s fastest growing trade  partners. We need to continue to promote that trade. It helps our economy.  It deepens the economic linkages. We  can explore clean energy  initiatives,  and we can help them as they continue  to strengthen transparency in government and the rule of law. We need to  pay more attention to Latin America,  not less. Disengagement is not the answer. This is just another reason we  need to confirm this nomination as  quickly as possible for Ambassador to  El Salvador.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",2011

1000,70,2011-12-06,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  rise today to honor a gentleman by the  name of John Katz. John is a longtime  public servant to the State of Alaska  who is set to retire at year’s end. John  has served Alaska  for more than 40  years, working for eight different Governors, Republican  and Democratic,  liberals and conservatives. He once said  he was comfortable serving so many  different Governors because the issues  for Alaska were consistent. Whether  they be responsible resource development, State sovereignty, or Federal assistance with infrastructure, the one  constant figure connecting one administration after the next over eight administrations has been John Katz.  John started his career as a high  school teacher and coach in Baltimore  City public schools back in 1966, following his graduation from Johns Hopkins University. In 1969, he earned his  law degree from the University of California at Berkeley. He then moved to  Alaska to work as a legislative and administrative assistant to Congressman  Pollock and then later for Senator Ted  Stevens.  John has truly played many crucial  roles for the State of Alaska. He served  for several years as the counsel to the  Joint Federal-State Land Use Planning  Commission for the State of Alaska. He  served as special counsel to Gov. Jay  Hammond back in 1979, advocating the  State’s position on  the Alaska National  Interest  Lands  Conservation  Act, or ANILCA,  to Congress. Two  years after that, he was appointed commissioner of natural resources by Governor Hammond. Then, in 1983, John  was sent by Gov. Bill Sheffield to head  Alaska’s Washington, DC, office, and  he has served as the liaison between  the State and the Federal Government  for the past 28 years—a pretty remarkable record, if you would consider it.  As Alaskans, we know how important  his role has been in bridging the very  considerable gap between our State and  the Federal Government—a key role  when more than 60 percent of Alaska’s  land is controlled by the Federal Government.  You could refer to John as Alaska’s  fourth Congressman—his 40-year tenure in the league of the late Senator  Stevens  and  Representative  Don  YOUNG. John’s breadth of knowledge  and understanding of Alaska’s issues  have guided him  in his very unique  role.  Since entering public service, John  has been involved in key issues, such as  the passage of the  landmark Alaska  Native Claims Settlement Act back in  1971, the legislation in 1976 which extended America’s fishery zones to 200  miles which allowed for the Americanization of Alaska’s fishing fleet. There  was also the passage back in 1980 of the  Alaska National  Interest Land Conservation Act, the Nation’s largest conservation lands measure. There was the  Alaska Railroad Transfer Act back in  1983, the Tongass Timber Reform Act  in 1990 and 30 other major pieces of legislation and hundreds of amendments  that have greatly affected the lives of  all Alaskans.

1001,78,2011-12-06,Mr. MORAN.," Madam President, a few  weeks ago, in November, in communities across our country, our Nation’s  men and women in uniform were honored on Veterans Day for their service  to our Nation. I wish to share a story  with my colleagues of one exceptional  Kansas veteran who is no longer with  us but whose story stands as a lasting  tribute to the members of our Armed  Forces whose courage and sacrifice preserve our freedoms.  Father Emil Kapaun was born  in  Pilsen, KS,  in 1916 and served as a  Catholic priest in the diocese of Wichita for 4 years before volunteering for  the U.S. Army in 1944. During the Korean war, he served as a chaplain for  the 8th Calvary Regiment of the First  Army Division.  His courageous actions in the Korean  battlefields saved countless lives as he  ran under enemy fire to rescue wounded soldiers. When Father Kapaun was  taken prisoner in 1950, he continued to  live out  the Army chaplain motto:  ‘‘For God and country.’’  In the bitter cold of winter, Father  Kapaun carried his injured comrades  on his back during  forced marches  through snow and ice, gave away his  meager food rations, and cared for the  sick who were suffering alongside him  in  the prison  camp. When all  else  looked  hopeless,  this  simple  priest  from Kansas rallied his comrades, regardless of their  faith, to persevere,  until his own death as a prisoner of war  in 1951. This good man distinguished  himself by laying down his life for the  sake of others.  Earlier this year, Senator ROBERTS  and I introduced legislation to award  this Kansas war hero the Medal of  Honor for his acts of valor in the Korean war. The legislation would request  and provide the Department of Defense  and the President with the authority  to grant  this  important honor. By  waiving the 3-year statute of limitations—the timeframe in which it can  be awarded—Father Kapaun would be  eligible to receive the Medal of Honor.  Senator ROBERTS and I offered this  legislation recently as an amendment  to the Senate Defense authorization  bill and the amendment was unanimously  approved  by  the Senate.  I  thank Senators LEVINand MCCAIN for  their support. My Kansas colleagues in  the House were also successful in including  this  language  in  the House  version of the National Defense Authorization Act, and I ask that with  such strong support from both Chambers this provision be included in this  year’s final Defense authorization bill.  Father Kapaun is most deserving of  the distinguished award and I am hopeful the Secretary of Defense and President Obama will use the authority outlined in this legislation to give Father  Kapaun his long overdue recognition.  At this special season of the year, we  are reminded that there are saints and  heroes throughout the history of our  Nation who put others above themselves and live by God’s plan for their  lives. May we be inspired by their example and live our lives accordingly.  Father Kapaun demonstrated that one  person can make a difference and help  change the world.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.  f  WORK WELL TOGETHER  ",2011
1002,78,2011-12-06,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Madam President,  I wish to speak this afternoon about a  lesson that Washington, DC can learn  from Maryville, TN, which is my hometown. It is a lesson that most of us  learned in kindergarten and I learned  in my mother’s kindergarten, which  was in a converted garage in our backyard, and it was three words: ‘‘Work  well together.’’  The latest example of that was all  over the sports pages of my hometown  on Sunday:  ‘‘Historic Championship:  Maryville Wins the 13th State Title—  Most Ever.’’ Our  football  team has  learned to work well together. They  earned their second consecutive State  championship, as the newspaper said.  They  beat Memphis Whitehaven.  I  watched the game on statewide television. Their record this year was 15  and 0. It was their ninth State title and  ninth perfect season under an extraordinary coach, George Quarles, who has  won 179 games and lost 13 in his career  in Maryville. This is the most State titles of any school in Tennessee’s history. The  team  scored  35 or more  points in 109 of Coach Quarles’ first 191  games. Maryville has averaged 30 or  more points  in 12 of  its 13 seasons  under coach Quarles and  its  senior  quarterback  this  year,  Patton  Robinette, who has scholarships from  good schools everywhere, was named  the Gatorade Tennessee Football Player of the Year, part of which has to do  with his academic credentials. He has a  straight A-plus average.  This leads me to the second thing  they work well together on in Maryville, TN. The Maryville city schools  were named the best overall school district in the State, based on their academic performance, by the State Collaborative  on Reforming Education.  The Maryville city schools recently received all As on their State math, reading, social studies, science, and writing  assessments. According  to  the Tennessean, Maryville city schools have  the second highest test scores in the  State in reading and math. The high  school was selected as one of three finalists in the prized category of high  schools  ‘‘based primarily on student  achievement gains and progress over  time.’’ More than 80 percent of Maryville High School students were proficient or advanced in math, 88 percent  in reading/language arts. More than 90  percent graduated in 2010 from the high  school. Four  seniors were National  Merit semifinalists. 48 percent of Maryville High School students who took  the ACT college prep test last year met  all four benchmarks for college and career readiness—English, math, reading,  and science—compared to 15 percent  Statewide and 25 percent nationally.  So the football team and the students  have  learned to work well together,  academically  and  athletically,  at  Maryville High School.  How did this all happen? I know a little bit about this. I am a proud graduate, as the Presiding Officer may have  suspected by now, of Maryville High  School. I have wondered about this for  a long time: How could it have had  such success in so many things? It is  not the richest town in the State by a  long shot. Most families in Maryville  would describe themselves as middle  income.

1020,94,2011-12-06,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker, I submit the following.  Watching coal-miners at work, you realize  momentarily what different universes people  inhabit.—George Orwell.  George Orwell was humbled by coal miners—brave and earnest individuals who work  hard hours, often in cramped, damp, lamp-lit  corners far below the surface of the Earth. He  was shocked by the living and working conditions he witnessed while he boarded  in  the  coal mining communities of Northern England,  accompanying the miners underground to see,  first-hand,  the hot, horrible conditions under  which they labored.  ‘‘Down there,’’ he wrote, ‘‘where coal is dug  is a sort of world apart which one can quite  easily go  through  life without ever hearing  about. . . . It is so with all types of manual  work; it keeps us alive, and we are oblivious  of its existence. More than anyone else, perhaps, the miner can stand as the type of the  manual worker, not only because his work is  so exaggeratedly awful, but also because it is  so vitally necessary and yet so remote from  our experience, so invisible, as it were, that  we are capable of forgetting it as we forget the  blood in our veins.’’  Even now, in an age of Twitter and reality  TV, when every aspect of life can be beamed  around the world in an instant, it is too easy  to forget about the miner and his daily digging  chores, sequestered far from our view, though  intimately connected to so many of our daily  needs and desires.  Yet, from time to time, something happens  to remind us of that separate world. Unfortunately, that something is, too often, a tragedy,  like the explosion at Massey Energy’s Upper  Big Branch Mine in Southern West Virginia, on  April 5, 2010, that took the lives, far too soon,  of 29 hardworking men.  In the hours following that explosion, reporters from around the Nation flocked to the mine  site, nestled in a rural mountain fold not far  from my home. Every phase of the attempted  rescue effort was  captured and broadcast  around  the globe, and  for many  tense and  worrisome hours, coal miners were very much  on the minds of the world, holding its collective breath and hoping for a miracle—a miracle that was not be.  Now, after the passing of many months, it is  clear that the loss of those 29 miners was not  due to one unpreventable, fateful incident, but,  instead, it was the result of a pervasive, long-  running, callous corporate culture that put production and profit far above people.  It  is no coincidence  that,  today,  the Mine  Safety and Health Administration is releasing  its final report on the UBB disaster. This day,  December 6th—the anniversary of  the 1907  Monongah Mine disaster, the worst mining disaster  in American history—is also  the Congressionally  designated  ‘‘National  Miners  Day.’’  I am proud to have been the author of the  House Resolution that sought to establish this  date as a milestone of national  recognition  and remembrance of America’s miners. It is a  shameful truth that each advance in our Nation’s mine safety system has come only after  a mine disaster. But I hope that this day might  alter that tradition and serve to bring the miner  out from the dark of the mines into the national light for at least one day each year. It  seems to me far preferable that our national  conscience be kindled not by tragedy, but, instead, by celebration.  And so I urge that, at least on this one day  each year,  the Congress and all Americans  will turn our attention to recognizing the contributions that miners have made to our Nation—its  economic  vitality  and  its military  strength. And that we will take this annual opportunity to help ensure that these men and  women are assured of safe, healthy, humane  conditions in which to earn an honest living.  America and American miners deserve no  less.  f  HONORING LEWIS WILLIAMS  HON. KATHY CASTOR  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 6, 2011  ",2011
1021,94,2011-12-06,Ms. CASTOR of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor and highlight the distinguished  life and career of the Honorable Lew Williams,  who passed away sadly on December 3rd,  2011. Mr. Williams was a member of  the  Pinellas County School Board and a local educator. His impact on our community will be felt  for years to come. He leaves behind two children and his wife, Arthurene.  Mr. Williams was elected  to  the Pinellas  County School Board in 2010. However, over  his  lifetime, his  impact was profound. Quiet  and reserved, he chose his words carefully in  a way that would be sure to have the most impact. His colleagues on  the School Board  have noted  that he often had  the ability  to  drive debates to a solution, while being one of  the quietest individuals in the room. In his time  on the Board, he was able to move the district  in a different direction and was instrumental in  leading the fight for changes in the district’s  superintendent position.  Lew Williams was born in Blakely, Georgia,  but moved to Florida at a young age. Growing  up in public housing, he saw education as a  means to future success. Two educators saw  his potential for achievement and helped pay  his way for college. He graduated from Allen  University with a bachelor’s degree and South  Carolina State College with a master’s degree.  Mr. Williams was instilled with the same optimistic belief in those around him. He started  out as a social studies teacher, but eventually  went on to become a principal at five different  Pinellas County schools. In 2010, Mr. Williams  was elected to the School Board seat for District 7. Local educational leaders, such as the  current head of the local teachers union, credit  him  for seeing  leadership  in  them when he  chose to hire them. His hard work, sacrifice  and determination have  truly  impacted our  community and continue to do so.  The Tampa Bay community mourns his loss  and is so thankful for his many years of service to students and our community. I ask that  you and all Americans remember such a remarkable educator for his ability to inspire success in others.  f  HONORING DR. CHARLES  GRINDSTAFF  HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH  OFVIRGINIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 6, 2011  ",2011
1022,94,2011-12-06,Mr. GRIFFITH of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker,  I  submit  these  remarks  in memory  of Dr.  Charles Grindstaff, a great man, devoted educator, and public servant from Southwest Virginia. Dr. Grindstaff  left us on December 2,  2011.  Born on September 3, 1947, in Bluefield, W.  Va., Dr. Grindstaff was  raised  in  the small  town of Bishop, Va. He later earned degrees  from Tazewell High School, East Tennessee  State  University,  Radford  University,  and  NOVA University. After God and  family, Dr.  Grindstaff’s  passion was  education. Since  1969, Dr. Grindstaff—often known simply as  ‘‘Dr. G’’—served students as a  teacher, administrator, and professor in Tazewell County  Public Schools, Horry County, SC Schools,  and at Concord University in Athens, W. Va.  For over 15 years, Dr. Grindstaff also served  the Town of Tazewell as a councilman and as  mayor until the time of his death. He was an  avid sportsman, enjoyed performing  in  local  theatre, and sharing his musical  talents. Dr.  Grindstaff  leaves behind his wife Suzanne,  daughters Heather and Christina, and his son  Andy, as well as three grandchildren.  Dr. Grindstaff, through both his work in the  classroom and  local government,  impacted  countless lives. He was also my District Director Michelle Bostic Jenkins’ principal at Jewell  Ridge Elementary and taught with her mother  for several years. After a flood on the Clinch  River destroyed many of their belongings, Dr.  Grindstaff was there willing to help. He was  well known  for his exceptional goodwill and  dedication  to  the Tazewell community.  I am  honored  to pay  tribute  to  this great man’s  many contributions. His legacy and influence  will be  long  remembered  in Tazewell and  throughout Southwest Virginia. He will be  missed, but never forgotten.
