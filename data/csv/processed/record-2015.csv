7,House,114,-0.465,18,2015-01-06,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. VANHOLLEN), the distinguished returning ranking member of the Committee on the  Budget.  b 1545  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I  thank my colleague.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is absolutely astounding  that within minutes—minutes—of our being sworn in, our Republican colleagues want to pass a rule  that will stack the deck in favor of trying to give another big tax cut not to  the middle class, but to millionaires,  the folks at the very top. That is what  their budget does.  What is equally astounding is that  this economic theory of trickle-down  economics crashed and burned in the  real world between 2001 and 2008. Our  Republican colleague says that if you  give millionaires these tax cuts, they  are going to spend them, and a little  bit will trickle down to the middle  class and people who aspire to the middle class and boost everybody up.  That  is not what happened. What  happened? Sure, the folks who got the  tax cuts at the top, they did better. Nobody else did. In fact, real wages went  down. What went up? The deficit—and  everybody has to pay for that deficit.  Now, I heard the Speaker this morning say he wanted to deal with the  issue of wage stagnation. That is what  we should be focused on. We shouldn’t  be  talking  about  tax  cuts  for  the  wealthy and a trickle-down theory. We  should try to build this economy from  the middle class out and from the bottom up.  I am glad the Speaker said that because we are going to give him an opportunity to vote for something that  will address wage  stagnation.  I am  going to offer a motion at the end of  this debate. It is called the CEO-Employee Paycheck Fairness Act, and it  addresses this issue.  If you  look back  in the 1960s and  1970s, when workers were working hard,  they got paid more, but beginning  around 1979, they kept working hard,  productivity kept going up, but their  wages got flat. What happened during  the  same  time? CEOs  took care of  themselves. Their pay started to go up  and up and up. It used to be about 20  times that of the average worker.  In other words, the CEO and the folks  at the top got about 20 times what they  were paying their employees, but as  you can see, it has now shot up so that  CEOs and the top guys get paid about  300 times what their workers are getting paid.  We have a simple proposition: that  corporations should not be able to deduct the bonuses and compensation for  their CEOs and other executives over $1  million unless they are giving their  employees a fair shake, a fair wage.  Right? Why should the taxpayers be  subsidizing that?  Between  2007 and  2010,  they  took  about $66 billion, thereabouts, in deductions for bonuses for performance  pay when they were sometimes laying  off employees and cutting their paychecks, so we say:  ‘‘Hey, okay, pay  yourselves what you want, but if you  want the taxpayers to allow you to deduct your bonuses and performance  pay, for goodness’ sakes, you had better be giving your employees a  fair  shake.’’  Over time, that would close that gap  in worker productivity and wages and  do what the Speaker said he wanted to  do this morning, which is deal with  wage stagnation. Let’s help the workers, not just the CEOs. Let’s vote for  the CEO-Employee Paycheck Fairness  Act.  ",2015

11,Senate,114,-0.266,67,2015-01-06,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased  to  introduce  the  Transnational Drug Trafficking Act of  2015 with my colleagues and friends,  Senators CHARLESGRASSLEY, RICHARD  BLUMENTHAL, HEIDI HEITKAMP, AMY  KLOBUCHARand TOMUDALL.  This bill, which passed the Senate  unanimously in the last Congress, supports  the  Obama  Administration’s  Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime by providing the Department of Justice with crucial tools to  combat the international drug trade.  As drug traffickers find new and innovative ways to avoid prosecution, we  cannot allow them to exploit loopholes  because our laws lag behind.  This legislation has three main components. First, it puts in place penalties  for extraterritorial drug  trafficking activity when individuals have  reasonable cause to believe that illegal  drugs will be trafficked into the United  States. Current  law  says  that drug  traffickers must know  that  illegal  drugs will be trafficked into the United  States and this legislation would lower  the knowledge threshold to reasonable  cause to believe.  The Department of Justice has informed my office that,  it sees drug  traffickers from countries like Colombia, Bolivia and Peru who produce cocaine  but  then  outsource  transportation of the cocaine to the United  States to violent Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Under current  law, our ability to prosecute source-nation traffickers from these countries is  limited since there is often no direct  evidence of their knowledge that illegal drugs were intended for the United  VerDate Sep 11 2014  05:57 Jan 07, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A06JA6.054 S06JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o r e c n e p S S         ",2015
12,,114,-0.658,81,2015-01-06,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I submit the  following:  SUMMARY  The ‘‘Home Foreclosure Reduction Act of  2015’’ would permit a bankruptcy judge, with  respect to certain home mortgages, to reduce  the principal amount of such mortgages to  the fair market value of the homes securing  such indebtedness. My legislation will encourage homeowners to make their mortgage  payments and help stem the endless cycle of  foreclosures that further depresses home values. It also would authorize the mortgage’s  repayment period to be extended so that  monthly mortgage payments are more affordable. In addition, the bill would allow exorbitant mortgage interest rates to be reduced to a level that will keep the mortgage  affordable over the long-term. And, it would  authorize  the waiver of prepayment penalties and excessive fees. Further, the bill  would eliminate hidden fees and unauthorized costs.  This bill addresses a fundamental problem:  homeowners in financial distress simply lack  the leverage to make mortgage lenders and  servicers engage in meaningful settlement  negotiations, even when in the interest of all  parties. My  legislation would empower a  homeowner, under certain circumstances, to  force his or her lender to modify the terms of  the mortgage  by  allowing  the  principal  amount of the mortgage to be reduced to the  home’s fair market value. And, the implementation of this measure will not cost taxpayers a single penny.  The ‘‘Home Foreclosure Reduction Act of  2015’’ is identical to H.R. 101 (introduced in  the 113th Congress) and H.R. 1587 (introduced  in the 112th Congress). It contains similar  provisions included in H.R. 1106, which the  House passed nearly six years ago. Unfortunately, those provisions were removed in the  Senate and not included in the final version  of the bill that was subsequently enacted  into law.  SECTION-BY-SECTIONEXPLANATIONOF  PROVISIONS  Section 1. Short Title. Section 1 sets forth  the short title of this Act as the  ‘‘Home  Foreclosure Reduction Act of 2015.’’  Section 2. Definition. Bankruptcy Code section 101 defines various terms. Section 2  amends this provision to add a definition of  ‘‘qualified loan modification,’’ which is defined as a loan modification agreement made  in accordance with the guidelines of the  Obama Administration’s Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, as implemented  on March 4, 2009 with respect to a loan secured by a senior security interest in the  debtor’s principal residence. To qualify as  such, the agreement must reduce the debtor’s mortgage payment (including principal  and interest) and payments for various other  specified expenses  (i.e., real estate taxes,  hazard insurance, mortgage insurance premium, homeowners’ association dues, ground  rent, and special assessments) to a percentage of the debtor’s  income  in accordance  with such guidelines. The payment may not  include any period of negative amortization  and it must fully amortize the outstanding  mortgage principal. In addition, the agreement must not require the debtor to pay any  fees or charges to obtain the modification.  Further,  the agreement must permit  the  debtor to continue to make these payments  as if he or she had not filed for bankruptcy  relief.  Section 3. Eligibility  for Relief. Section 3  amends Bankruptcy Code section 109, which  specifies the eligibility criteria for filing for  bankruptcy relief, in two respects. First, it  amends Bankruptcy Code  section  109(e),  which sets forth secured and unsecured debt  limits to establish a debtor’s eligibility for  relief under chapter 13. Section 3 amends  this provision to provide that the computation of debts does not include the secured or  unsecured portions of debts secured by the  debtor’s principal residence, under certain  circumstances. The exception applies if the  value of the debtor’s principal residence as of  the date of the order for relief under chapter  13  is  less  than  the applicable maximum  amount of the secured debt limit specified in  section 109(e). Alternatively, the exception  applies  if the debtor’s principal residence  was sold in foreclosure or the debtor surrendered such residence to the creditor and the  value of such residence as of the date of the  order for relief under chapter 13 is less than  the secured debt limit specified in section  109(e). This amendment is not intended to  create personal liability on a debt if there  would not otherwise be personal liability on  such debt.  Second, section 3 amends Bankruptcy Code  section 109(h), which requires a debtor to receive credit counseling within the 180-day period prior to  filing  for bankruptcy relief,  with  limited exception. Section 3 amends  this provision to allow a chapter 13 debtor to  satisfy this requirement within 30 days after  filing for bankruptcy relief if he or she submits to the court a certification that the  debtor has received notice that the holder of  a claim secured by the debtor’s principal residence may commence a  foreclosure proceeding.  Section 4. Prohibiting Claims Arising  from  Violations of the Truth in Lending Act. Under  the Truth in Lending Act, a mortgagor has a  right of rescission with respect to a mortgage secured by his or her residence, under  certain circumstances. Bankruptcy Code section  502(b) enumerates various claims of  creditors that are not entitled to payment in  a bankruptcy case, subject to certain exceptions. Section 4 amends Bankruptcy Code  section 502(b) to provide that a claim for a  loan secured by a security interest in the  debtor’s principal residence is not entitled to  payment in a bankruptcy case to the extent  that such claim is subject to a remedy for rescission under the Truth  in Lending Act,  notwithstanding the prior entry of a foreclosure  judgment.  In addition,  section  4  specifies that nothing in this provision may  be construed to modify, impair, or supersede  any other right of the debtor.  Section 5. Authority to Modify Certain Mortgages.  Under  Bankruptcy  Code  section  1322(b)(2), a chapter 13 plan may not modify  the terms of a mortgage secured solely by  real property that is the debtor’s principal  residence. Section  5  amends Bankruptcy  Code section 1322(b) to create a limited exception to this prohibition. As amended, the  exception only applies to a mortgage that:  (1) originated before the effective date of this  amendment; and (2) is the subject of a notice  that a foreclosure may be (or has been) commenced with respect to such mortgage.  In addition, the debtor must certify pursuant to new section 1322(h) that he or she contacted—not less than 30 days before filing for  bankruptcy relief—the mortgagee (or the entity collecting payments on behalf of such  mortgagee)  regarding modification of  the  mortgage. The debtor must also certify that  he or she provided the mortgagee (or the entity collecting payments on behalf of such  mortgagee) a written statement of the debtor’s current income, expenses, and debt in a  format that substantially conforms with the  schedules required under Bankruptcy Code  section 521 or with such other form as promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the  United States. Further,  the  certification  must include a statement that the debtor  considered any qualified loan modification  offered to the debtor by the mortgagee (or  the entity collecting payments on behalf of  such holder). This  requirement does not  apply if the foreclosure sale is scheduled to  VerDate Sep 11 2014  09:37 Jan 07, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A06JA8.010 E06JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T Q 7 6 K S D l n o d a n o d c m e         ",2015
13,,114,-0.402,88,2015-01-06,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay  tribute to Major Jacob ‘ ‘Jake ’ ’ A. Whiteside for  his dedication to duty and service as a Defense Legislative Fellow. Major Whiteside will  be transitioning from his present assignment  with my office to serve as the Executive Officer  for  the 12th Aviation Battalion, United  States Army.  A native of Memphis, Tennessee, Major  Whiteside was accepted into the Carson-Newman University Reserve Officer Training Corps  program in 1999, where he earned a Bachelor  of Arts Degree in English Literature and graduated as a Distinguished Military Graduate  with the class of 2003. Upon graduation, Jake  was  commissioned  as  an  Army  Aviation  Branch Officer. He has subsequently earned a  Master ’s degree in Legislative Affairs from the  George Washington University.  Prior  to entering  the Army Congressional  Fellowship Program, Jake served in numerous  tactical  leadership and staff assignments as  an Army Aviation Branch Officer, and Scout/  Attack  OH–58  helicopter  Pilot.  Major  Whiteside’s assignments include Flight School  Student, United States Army Aviation Center  of Excellence, Fort Rucker; Flight Platoon  Leader, 1st Battalion (Attack), 82nd Combat  Aviation Brigade, Fort Bragg; Future Operations and Current Operations Officer, 1st  Squadron,  17th CAV,  Fort Bragg; Headquarters Troop Commander, 1st Squadron,  17th CAV, Fort Bragg; Student, Army Aviation  Captain’s Career Course, Army Aviation Center of Excellence, Fort Rucker; and most recently Aviation Branch Representative, United  States Military Academy, West Point. Additionally, Major Whiteside was deployed in direct  support of combat operations in Mosul, Iraq, in  2006–2007, and Regional Command —South,  Afghanistan,  in 2009–2010. While deployed,  Jake accumulated over 500 hours of combat  flight time in direct support of soldiers in the  fight.  Throughout his career, Major Whiteside has  positively impacted his soldiers, peers, and superiors. Our country has been enriched by his  extraordinary leadership, thoughtful judgment,  and exemplary work.  As a personal matter, in his role as Defense  Legislative Fellow, Jake provided me with candid advice and became a  trusted source of  counsel to me, my personal staff, and committee staff. Blessed with a sterling  intellect  and nimble mind, he vigorously and effectively  addressed any challenging task placed before  him. Further, his  incomparable work ethic,  poise under pressure, and generosity will be  sorely missed.  To  put  it  simply, Major  Whiteside’s performance has set a standard  on which  I will evaluate all  future Congressional Fellows.  Mr. Speaker, it has been a genuine pleasure to have worked with Major Jake Whiteside  over the last year. On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in recognizing  and commending Jake for his service to his  country and we wish him, his wife Marci, and  boys, Bryce and Gavin, all the best as they  continue  their  journey  in  the United States  Army.  f  IN RECOGNITION  OF  THE  BIRTHDAY  OF  MERCY  SCHOOL  BURLINGAME’S  MANSION  100TH  HIGH  KOHL  HON. JACKIE SPEIER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 6, 2015  ",2015
14,,114,-0.385,88,2015-01-06,Ms. SPEIER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor  the Centennial of Mercy High School Burlingame’s Kohl Mansion, an historic and beautiful building with deep meaning for the community and for me personally. As an alumna  of Mercy High and the mother of a daughter  who also graduated  from  this outstanding  school, this institution has shaped my life.  Today, Mercy High School Burlingame, a  Catholic college preparatory high school, educates 400 young women a year, with the majority coming from San Mateo County. About  three quarters of  the students are Roman  Catholic and 90 percent of the students are  engaged in at least one extra-curricular activity. Mercy encourages students  to discover  themselves and explore their dreams; they receive an education of mind, body and spirit.  This recipe and small class sizes prove to be  highly successful. In the class of 2014, 87 percent matriculated to four year colleges and 13  percent matriculated to community colleges.  Mercy education finds its origins in Ireland  in  the ministry of Catherine McAuley,  the  foundress of the Sisters of Mercy. Their work  is marked by a special concern for the needs  of the poor, in particular women and children.  This tradition continues to this day.  The Kohl Mansion was originally built from  1912 to 1914 by Charles Frederick ‘ ‘Freddie’ ’  Kohl  for his wife Bessie. Kohl, born  in San  Jose in 1863, grew up in a mansion on an estate  in San Mateo, now known as Central  Park. His father had made a fortune as the  founder of Alaska Commercial Company and  so Kohl Junior was used to an opulent lifestyle. Freddie and Bessie’s travels to Europe  further inspired them to build the lavish four-  story Tudor named ‘ ‘The Oaks.’ ’  In 1924,  the Sisters of Mercy bought  the  house and turned it into a chapel. When the  sisters moved down the hill to a new building,  Principal Sister Mary Lorenzo Murphy and  seven other nuns opened Mercy High School  in the mansion in 1931, admitting 36 freshmen  and sophomores.  The old Kohl Mansion has embraced technology and modern facilities. Mercy launched  its website in 1999. Over the decades, a state-  of-the art athletic center with an Olympic size  pool, a commercial kitchen, a new cafeteria  and a multi-media center were built, among  the many improvements. At every step of the  way, the focus of the school was to provide its  students with the best education and learning  environment possible.  Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me to honor one of the finest high schools in the country, Mercy High  School Burlingame on  the occasion of  the  Kohl Mansion ’s 100th birthday. May this historic building remain  the home of education  and learning for centuries to come.

The most valuable player, Ezekiel Elliott,  broke  national  championship  records for rushing yards and rushing  touchdowns; and to our winning quarterback, Cardale Jones—who made the  victory possible last night—to all the  players, fans, the band, coaches, and  athletic directors, I say, ‘‘Congratulations.’’  Go, Bucks.  f  GOOD SAMARITAN SEARCH AND  RECOVERY ACT  (Mr. HECK of Nevada asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

16,House,114,-0.343,8,2015-01-13,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Mr. Speaker,  in December, Congress passed a  spending bill to keep the government  open, finally providing some certainty  to our economy.  Another shutdown was the last thing  anyone needed, but we cannot forget  that one agency was left out: the Department of Homeland Security. Creating uncertainty at Homeland Security  is reckless because  it threatens  our national security.  The tragic events in France remind  us that we need to be as vigilant as  ever. So why is this funding held back?  So the majority can try to force its immigration policy on the President and  the full Congress.  We can and we should have the immigration debate, but it should not hold  hostage  the  hardworking men  and  women who guard our ports and protect our borders.  Mr. Speaker, let’s do the right thing.  Let’s fund Homeland Security and have  a proper debate on immigration. This  is not an either/or situation; it is a  both/and.  f  THE CBP NEEDS TO PAY WHAT IT  OWES  (Mr.  BOUSTANY  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

17,House,114,0.392,8,2015-01-13,Mr. BOUSTANY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to draw attention to an issue with serious implications for Louisiana.  Over the past 20 years, Customs and  Border Protection has not only failed  to collect $2.3 billion in antidumping  duties, it has doubled down by refusing  to pay collected interest owed to American industries like Louisiana’s crawfish processors.  Last October, CBP  promised  this  Louisiana industry it would disburse $6  million in interest, only to reverse its  decision 1 month later. This is just unacceptable.  While I was able to include language  in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill to address this issue, I still  don’t believe it goes far enough to ensure  that CBP  is  forced  to  follow  through on paying what it owes under  the law.  It is vitally important that Congress  hold CBP accountable. This industry is  not only an important job creator, it  has deep Louisiana roots in Louisiana’s  culture.  Mr. Speaker, I will not allow CBP to  run over this industry without a fight.  b1215  WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE WORLD  TO  STAND  BY  WHILE  BOKO  HARAM KILLS  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I  rise today again to join my colleagues  whom you will hear from to challenge  this dastardly act of our 300 girls that  remain captured, abused, violated, impregnated, and maybe even married  into the horrors of Boko Haram. These  women and these voices that you see  are the very women that we met when  we went to Borno State just last year  as they pleaded to be able to bring the  girls back, but now their voices were  turned toward the 2,000 who have been  killed by the horrors of Boko Haram.  So, Mr. Speaker, as I join my colleagues today, I ask for a global response in the war on Boko Haram, a  global  response  from  the  African  Union,  a  global  response  from  the  United Nations, and a global response  from the world to fight against Boko  Haram and, at the same time, to save  the boys that are being recruited by  this violent and horrible leader. This  leader is turning these young boys into  violent killers. 2,000 dead bodies are all  over the ground, and our girls now are  still suffering.  So to these beautiful women who are  now still in the midst saying bring the  girls back, I want to tell them that we  are coming to the rescue. We will not  allow the world to stand by while Boko  Haram kills.  f  THE RULE OF LAW  (Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2015
18,House,114,-0.279,15,2015-01-13,Mr. POLIS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 1  minute to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. JACKSONLEE).  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was  given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I  think my good friends who are on the  floor today, my good friends on the Republican side of the aisle, have failed  to  read  the Constitution, which  includes, clearly, the President’s authority for executive actions and not, as  they have articulated, an executive  order.  And it says in the ‘‘take care clause’’  that he has the ability to manage this  government, as Presidents Reagan and  Eisenhower did.  What I would offer to say is, there is  nothing in what the President has done  but to exercise executive action. But I  will say to them that Secretary Johnson of Homeland Security has said that  we are placing ourselves in a dangerous  position, not because of the President’s  actions, not because of the appropriations bill, but because of these enormous poison pills that are stamping  and stomping on the President’s right  to executive action.  I oppose all of the bills that are presently in this rule, including the regulatory bill, the Financial Services—all  of them have poison pills. The regulatory bill, for example, wants 70 criteria before any agency can pass a regulation.  Yes, to my Republican friends, we are  in  a moment,  a  historic moment.  France was more than a wake-up call.  But what I will say to you is that we  can pass a clean Homeland Security appropriations bill and we can end this  dangerous condition that we are in.  I would ask my colleagues to eliminate the poison pills of pulling back on  the President’s constitutional authority.  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition to the rule for H.R. 240, the Homeland Security Appropriations Act  for Fiscal  Year 2015.  I oppose  the rule because,  if passed,  the  five Republican amendments made in order by  the Rules Committee guarantee the bill will be  vetoed by the President at a time when ensuring  that  the agencies charged with securing  our border and protecting the homeland have  the resources needed to keep us safe should  be our highest priority.  House Republicans are playing a dangerous  game of Russian Roulette with the security of  America’s homeland by recklessly adding this  ‘‘poison pill’’ to legislation needed to fund the  agencies and programs charged with securing  the border and protecting the homeland.  Mr. Speaker, the amendments to H.R. 240  made  in order by  the Rules Committee are  simply  the  latest attempt by House Republicans  to prohibit  the executive branch  from  exempting or deferring  from deportation any  immigrants  considered  to  be  unlawfully  present in the United States under U.S. immigration law, and to prohibit the administration  from treating those immigrants as if they were  lawfully present or had lawful immigration status.  The  rule we are being asked  to accept  makes in order amendment that seek to block  the executive actions taken President Obama  to address our broken immigration system by  providing smarter enforcement at the border,  prioritize deporting  felons—not  families—and  allowing certain undocumented immigrants, including the parents of U.S. citizens and lawful  residents, who pass a criminal background  check and pay taxes to temporarily stay in the  U.S. without fear of deportation.  Mr. Speaker, the executive actions taken by  President Obama are reasonable, responsible,  and within his constitutional authority.  Under Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, the President, who is the nation’s Chief  Executive, ‘‘shall take Care that the Laws be  faithfully executed.’’  In addition  to establishing  the President’s  obligation  to execute  the  law,  the Supreme  Court has consistently  interpreted  the Take  Care Clause as ensuring presidential control  over those who execute and enforce the law  and the authority to decide how best to enforce  the  laws. See, e.g., Arizona v. United  States; Bowsher v. Synar; Buckley v. Valeo;  Printz v. United States; Free Enterprise Fund  v. PCAOB.  Every  law enforcement agency,  including  the agencies  that enforce  immigration  laws,  has  ‘‘prosecutorial discretion’’—the power  to  decide whom  to  investigate, arrest, detain,  charge, and prosecute.  Agencies, including the U.S. Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), may develop discretionary policies specific to the laws they are  charged with enforcing,  the population  they  serve, and the problems they face so that they  can prioritize resources to meet mission critical enforcement goals.  Executive authority  to  take action  is  thus  ‘‘fairly wide,’’ indeed the federal government’s  discretion  is extremely  ‘‘broad’’ as  the Supreme Court held in the recent case of Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499  (2012), an opinion written Justice Kennedy  and joined by Chief Justice Roberts:  Congress has specified which aliens may be  removed from the United States and the procedures for doing so. Aliens may be removed  if they were  inadmissible at the time of  entry, have been convicted of certain crimes,  or meet other criteria set by federal law. Removal is a civil, not criminal, matter. A  principal feature of the removal system is  the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials. Federal officials, as an initial  matter, must decide whether it makes sense  to pursue removal at all. If removal proceedings commence, aliens may seek asylum  and other discretionary relief allowing them  to remain in the country or at least to leave  without  formal removal.  (emphasis added)  (citations omitted).  The Court’s decision  in Arizona v. United  States, also strongly suggests that the executive branch’s discretion in matters of deportation may be exercised on an individual basis,  or it may be used to protect entire classes of  individuals such as  ‘‘[u]nauthorized workers  trying to support their families’’ or immigrants  who originate from countries torn apart by internal conflicts:  VerDate Sep 11 2014  02:08 Jan 14, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K13JA7.022 H13JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o r e c n e p S S         ",2015
19,House,114,-0.658,29,2015-01-13,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House,  last  evening,  the President  of  the  United States indicated that he will  not sign this bill, that he will veto it if  it were to pass, and I am hoping that  that doesn’t happen.  The measure fails in a great way. It  would create needless regulatory and  legal uncertainty and would  further  impede  the  implementation  protections for the American public.  This bill would make the regulatory  process more expensive, less flexible,  and more burdensome, dramatically increasing the costs of regulation of the  American taxpayer and working class  families.  This is an incredible situation that  we have to debate here. I am hopeful  that the logic, the rationale, the threat  of the executive branch to veto the bill  will all cause us to carefully consider  how unnecessary  this measure  is.  I  urge that we not support H.R. 185.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2015
20,House,114,0.495,29,2015-01-13,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Chairman, I  am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman  from  Texas  (Mr.  FARENTHOLD), the vice chairman of the  Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and  Antitrust Law Subcommittee.  ",2015
21,House,114,0.548,29,2015-01-13,Mr. FARENTHOLD.," Thank you very  much, Chairman GOODLATTE.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong  support of  the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2015.  There is no question that the Federal  Government and Federal  regulations  take a heavy toll on businesses of all  sizes. That toll isn’t just financial; it is  also stress, it is also time, it is also  emotional. Dealing with the government is difficult. Just the dollars-and-  cents cost of Federal regulation has  been estimated at $1.86 trillion—or so  the expert tells me. That adds up to  roughly $15,000 per household.  It is simply not right for unelected  bureaucrats to put that much weight  on the shoulders of the American people without making all efforts to minimize the costs and give the people of  south Texas and everywhere  in this  country the opportunity and a chance  to weigh in.  In Texas in particular, we have seen  how onerous EPA and Department of  the Interior and other regulations have  slowed job growth and the American  energy boom, costing our domestic energy companies millions of dollars.  This bill would put public discussion  back on the table when it comes to regulations and would ensure that the economic costs are fully considered and  minimized. We have a lot of work to do  to peel back some of the needless, overburdensome regulations that are strangling our businesses, but this bill will  help us plug the hole in the boat while  we get rid of—start pumping out—some  of the water.  The other side likes to say that it is  going to make it more difficult to regulate. It is supposed to be difficult to  enact laws and regulations. We have to  pass something out of the House, and  we have got to pass something out of  the Senate and get it signed by the  President to enact a law; but a bureaucrat can do  it, basically, with  the  stroke of a pen and a publication in the  Federal Register.  This act is going to do something to  curb that. We need less government,  fewer laws, fewer regulations—and not  more.  ",2015
22,House,114,0.351,29,2015-01-13,Mr. MARINO.," I thank the chairman.  Mr. Chairman, right now, we have  the worst of both worlds: more regulation and less scrutiny.  In looking at a recent 7-year period,  the Government Accountability Office  found that 35 percent of major rules  were  issued without the opportunity  for public comment. The GAO also  found a lack of responsiveness. In the  case of one ObamaCare  regulation—  one—4,627 comments were received, but  no responses were issued.  Regulatory costs disproportionately  hit small manufacturers, which incur  regulatory costs of $34,671 per year, per  employee—more than three times that  of the average American economy. Our  energy boom is a perfect example of  failed regulatory policy.  Oil and natural gas resources do not  know Federal versus State boundaries,  but it takes 10 times as long for the  Federal Government to issue a permit  as it does the States. As a result, oil  MARINO),  and gas production is going up sharply  on State lands and down on Federal  lands.  Finally, ObamaCare is an epicenter  of  red  tape.  In  its  first  4  years,  ObamaCare’s effects on small business  amounted to $1.9 billion in regulatory  costs and in 11.3 million hours of compliance. This amounts to a regulatory  tax of 3 to 5 percent. Again, this is the  cost of just one law’s regulations.  b1545  ",2015

26,House,114,-0.379,99,2015-01-13,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Chair, I thank the  gentlelady  for  yielding.  I want  to  thank  the  chairman  of  the  subcommittee for the work that he has  done on this bill. I want to thank the  ranking member of the Committee on  Appropriations and Mr. PRICEfor working on this bill.  This bill  is an appropriation bill.  This bill funds the Department that is  charged with  the  responsibility  of  keeping America safe and Americans  safe. This bill is an appropriation bill.  It is against the rules of the House of  Representatives to put legislative language on an appropriation bill.  Now, frankly, having served there 20,  30 years, I know that that rule is not  always  followed; and you, therefore,  need a waiver  from the Rules Committee in order to effect this end. This  is not, therefore, regular order.  We just had another demonstration  of  the clear and present danger  to  which every citizen in the free world is  subject. We saw it in France, and 17  people lost their lives.  b1815  We, of course, lost over 3,000 lives on  9/11. This is an issue on which there  ought to be no difference among the 435  of us who have the privilege and honor  of serving in this country and in this  Congress.  Mr. HENSARLINGraised his right hand  to preserve and protect, yes, the Constitution and laws thereof, but also to  preserve and protect the general welfare of all of our people. That is what  this bill seeks to do.  Mr. Chairman, there are many compelling reasons why the House must  pass a bill to fund the Department of  Homeland Security without delay.  I  have spoken to some of them. We saw  one of those reasons all too clearly last  week, as I have said. Our Homeland Security agencies are hard at work every  day  to prevent  incidents  like  those  from occurring here  in  the United  States, and how extraordinarily successful they have been since 9/11.  Again, Chairman CARTERand Ranking Member LOWEY,  I want to congratulate you for coming together and  agreeing on a bill, agreeing on funding  levels, and agreeing on the objects of  expenditures to keep Americans and  America safe. But with only a continuing resolution to fund it, as has  happened in December, the Department  does not have the full flexibility necessary to respond to every threat to  the best of its ability. This leaves us  vulnerable at a time when we cannot  afford to be vulnerable. That is why it  is so unfortunate that House Republicans have chosen to play political  games.  If this is, in fact, unconstitutional,  the courts are set forth, in article III,  to resolve this  issue. If you  feel so  strongly that you are right, that  is  where relief should be sought. But let  us not hold America’s national security and the safety of our people hostage to that political difference.  In  doing so, you have managed to snatch  partisanship  from  the  jaws of  consensus. We have agreement. The underlying bill before us will have the support of over 400 Members.

27,House,114,0.433,99,2015-01-13,Mr. ROSKAM.," I thank the chairman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I look at this from an  entirely different perspective. I look at  this as the House of Representatives  asserting  its will, speaking out, and  saying, no, we are not going to be silent in the movement of the President  of the United States. If we had done  nothing, Mr. Chairman, then the subsequent  argument  in weeks  to  come  would have been, well, you did nothing.  You were silent. You waived your right  to assert yourself. You have the power  of the purse, and you did nothing.  Well, clearly, we are not doing nothing. Clearly, we are taking it up. And  now here it is. We are coming together  and we are saying that we don’t believe  the President has this authority. We  are asserting that, and this bill will be  debated.  But at the underlying level there is  something absolutely  incredibly  significant and very bright that is happening, regardless of what side of the  aisle you are on, because do you know  what we are talking about? We are  talking about defending a country that  we all hold dear.  There was a story I heard from an exchange  student, Mr. Chairman, who  came to visit the United States. She  was asked about her time here—this  was a young college student—and they  said: What made the biggest impression  upon you during your  time  in  the  United States? She said this: The number of people who came up to me and  said, ‘‘What do you hope to do for a living? What do you want to do?’’ And it  was totally different for this girl, because the culture that she was coming  from, that wasn’t her experience, but  she came to the United States and  there was a brightness to it, an opportunity to it, and a freshness to it. She  found it so exciting and so dynamic.  That is what we are fighting about.  That is what we are fighting for. We  are fighting for a nation, to defend a  great nation, and to celebrate a great  nation. That is worth taking up.  So,  look,  there are very big differences in this House in the direction  to move. There are very deep differences in this House about how we  need  to deal with  the  immigration  problem.  ",2015

29,House,114,0.593,106,2015-01-13,Mr. POE of Texas.," I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Chair, ‘‘America is a Nation  of laws, which means, I, as the President, am obligated to enforce the law.  I don’t have a choice about that. That  is part of my job.  ‘‘With respect to the notion that I  can just suspend deportations through  executive order, that is just not the  case, because there are  laws on the  books that Congress has passed.  ‘‘There are enough laws on the books  by Congress  that are very clear  in  terms of how we have to enforce our  immigration system that  for me to  simply, through executive order, ignore  those congressional mandates, would  not conform with my appropriate role  as President.’’  Those are the words of the former  constitutional law professor, and now  President, on March 28, 2011. Those  very words  condemn  executive  amnesty.  The United States is ruled by law,  not by one person. The United States is  not a monarchy. If it were, we would  have kept King George III.  The executive amnesty is not only  unconstitutional, Madam Chair, it is at  cross-purposes to security. The Department of Homeland Security cannot secure the U.S. border, no matter how  many programs and how much money  we spend on homeland security, as long  as the Executive undermines law and  security by unilaterally ignoring those  very security laws.  We can give all the money we want  to the Department of Homeland Security, but that doesn’t do any good if we  do not make sure the law is enforced.  Madam Chairman, we will use this  example that has already been used by  my friend, ",2015

Mr.  Chairman,  House  Republican  leadership has chosen to play political  games with the security and safety of  our Nation by including extreme partisan poison pill amendments to this  Homeland Security funding bill. Rather than putting country before party,  House Republican leaders have chosen  to advance an extreme agenda instead  of doing what needs to be done to protect Americans.  This bill is a farce that puts scoring  political points above safeguarding our  communities. This is precisely the type  of political gimmick people  in  the  Coachella Valley and across the country are sick of.  The terrorist attacks in Paris last  week demonstrate how critical  it  is  that the men and women of our law enforcement agencies have the  funding  necessary to do their jobs and keep us  safe.  That is why I urge House Republican  leadership to allow a vote on a clean,  bipartisan Homeland Security bill that  ensures  law enforcement,  the Coast  Guard, and the Secret Service have the  resources  they need  to protect our  communities.  It is time to end the political bickering and work toward sensible, pragmatic solutions to keep our homeland  secure.  ",2015

Mr. Chairman, tonight I am reminded  of Thomas Jefferson, who once said:  ‘‘Experience hath  shown,  that  even  under the best forms of government,  those entrusted with power have,  in  time, and by slow operations, perverted  it.’’  Mr. Chairman, we have heard repeatedly  from our  leader, our President,  that he has said he is not king, he is  not emperor, and that his powers, as  President, are restricted. But his actions speak louder than words. Republicans are committed to holding the  President accountable  for his overreaching executive actions.  We have achieved remarkable success  in this country because we are a Nation governed by the rule of law, not by  the decrees of monarchs.  As recent events around the world  have tragically reminded us, there are  those who are still committed to destroying our way of life.  The Homeland Security Appropriations bill we are debating tonight supports the needs of the brave men and  women who protect us each day and  meets  the  requirements  to keep us  safe.  The amendments accompanying this  legislation ensure we continue to be a  Nation governed by laws and prevents  any funds from being used to implement the President’s unconstitutional  decrees of amnesty while it prevents  further  implementation  of  DACA,  which led to the crisis at the border  last summer.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me  in supporting this legislation to protect our great Nation and supporting  the amendments to protect the rule of  law.  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD.

This debate  is about something much more, much more important than that. This is a generational  conflict over something that is very  clear. It is not about Presidential prerogative or Presidential arrogance.  As a military officer for 14 years, I  had the honor of serving my country.  Prior to doing that, I took a sacred  oath of office, which is very similar to  the oath that all of us took last week,  to  defend  the Constitution  of  the  United States. That is what this legislation is about. That is why this piece  of legislation is so important.  This legislation seeks to restore the  balance of powers. It seeks to conform  that vision that our Founding Fathers  had, that miracle that was created in  Philadelphia that summer. It seeks to  conform and to preserve the principles  that so many people have died for.  The President is not a king. Congress  is tasked to create the law. That is  what this legislation is about. That is  why it is so important that we support  it.  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. I reserve the  balance of my time.  ",2015

Mr. Chair, today I rise in support of  H.R. 240, providing appropriations for  the Department of Homeland Security  for the remainder of this fiscal year.

35,House,114,-0.353,120,2015-01-13,Mr. LYNCH.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank the gentlewoman  for yielding  and for her great work on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition  to H.R.  37,  the  so-called Promoting Job Creation  and Reducing  Small Business Burdens Act.  I served on the Financial Services  Committee during the 2008  financial  crisis, and I had an opportunity to witness the harmful impact that lack of  regulation had on hardworking families around our Nation at a total cost  of more than $22 trillion, according to  the Government Accountability Office.  My constituents—and many of yours—  lost their homes, their jobs, and their  retirement savings during that period.  Many pension funds today continue to  suffer and are on the brink of collapse  because of the reckless policies that  were observed during  that  time by  many of our major banks.  While I voted against the bailout of  the Wall Street banks who were rewarded with bonuses as a result of the  bailout, I did have the honor of helping  to assist in reforming our financial system  through  the  enactment of  the  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act. I regret the  bill under consideration  today  rolls  back many of those reforms that my  colleagues and  I  fought  so hard  to  adopt.  I would note that after being defeated  last week under a suspension  process that offered no opportunity for  amendments,  this  bill  now  has  inexplicably been brought to the House  floor under a closed rule that again  does not include any of the 14 amendments that were filed with the Rules  Committee. At a minimum, a bill that  does so much harm to our financial  system necessitates the normal committee process and additional time for  debate.  H.R. 37 contains 11 separate bills, a  few of them which I support, others I  strongly oppose. Portions of H.R. 37  have entirely new provisions that the  members of the committee and of this  Congress have not had the opportunity  to thoroughly analyze.  By the way, if you desire a good review of this legislation, in this past  Sunday’s New York Times there is an  article written by Gretchen Morgenson  that I think is extremely well-written  and goes into great detail beyond the  time that I am allocated here tonight.  Title II of this bill would allow banks  with commercial business to trade derivatives  privately  rather  than  on  clearinghouses. This would  increase  risk and reduce transparency for these  transactions. My amendment, which  was not accepted, would have improved  the provisions by prohibiting systematically  important  financial  institutions, whose collapse would pose a serious risk to our financial system, from  claiming  the  exemption under  this  title.  Title VIII of this bill includes new  language that has not been considered  by the Financial Services Committee  under regular order.  If passed, title  VIII would give banks an additional 2  years to comply with the provisions of  the Volcker rule that mandates that  banks divest collateralized loan obligations—packages of risky debt.

56,Senate,114,0.631,155,2015-01-13,Mr. TOOMEY.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak about the  law enforcement  in  Pennsylvania  and  throughout  the  country.  We just finished the holiday season,  and in my family—as with many of us,  I am sure—we had a wonderful Christmas  in our homes, had a wonderful  meal, and got to watch the kids open  their presents.  There are a  lot of Pennsylvanians  and Americans who didn’t have the  chance to do what we got to enjoy, and  they were the  law enforcement men  and women who were  out  on  the  streets, in the cold, protecting us as  they do day in and day out because  their work goes on 24/7, 365 days a year.  Just this past Saturday a number of  us gathered on Independence Mall in  Philadelphia. Several hundred people  braved a very cold and windy day to let  the law enforcement officials of Pennsylvania and beyond know  just how  much we appreciate the sacrifice they  make for us day in and day out. We had  a terrific turnout. It was a very enthusiastic crowd who rallied in support of  our police officers.  But being a police officer is not just  often  inconvenient;  sometimes  it  is  very dangerous. Last year 115 police officers died in the line of duty. So far we  are 13 days into a new year and 10 officers have already been shot and wounded.  Often these police officers have been  targeted and shot just because of the  uniform  they  wear.  Unfortunately,  Pennsylvania  is not  immune to this  problem. Last year on September 12,  late at night, two Pennsylvania State  troopers were coming in for their shift  at work, and Eric Frein was lying in  wait, hiding in the woods, with a high-  powered rifle. He shot and killed Corporal Bryon Dickson,  and he  shot  Trooper Alex Douglass, who was grievously wounded. The killer, Eric Frein,  didn’t know either Corporal Dickson or  Trooper Douglass; he shot the two police officers simply because they were  police officers. He thought that somehow by killing a cop he would help  spark a revolution. Such is the madness police officers have to face on a  regular basis. On any given day they  don’t know that they won’t run into  that kind of insanity.  It is important for us to remember  that these victims—in this case, Corporal Dickson—aren’t  just  numbers  and badges. Corporal Dickson was a  dad, the father of two young boys. He  used to enjoy making toys for his sons.  He was a devoted husband who had recently celebrated his 10th wedding anniversary. He was  a  proud Marine  Corps veteran.  I am proud, as Pennsylvanians generally are, of the response of law enforcement to the savage and despicable  shooting of these two State troopers.  Officers from all across Pennsylvania  and  surrounding  States  and  even  around the country joined in a very intensive, tireless, 7-week-long manhunt.  In the end they found Eric Frein, and  they brought him into custody wearing  the handcuffs of Corporal Dickson. He  will meet justice.  But, of course, the story doesn’t end  there. There was another terrible tragedy just last month in Brooklyn. Just  5 days before Christmas, Officer Rafael  Ramos and Officer Wenjian Liu were  both murdered in the line of duty. In  the middle of the afternoon, in broad  daylight, a gunman approached their  marked police vehicle while they sat in  the vehicle and shot each police officer  point-blank range in the head, killing  them both instantly. The motivation of  the gunman was very clear: He just  wanted to kill any police officer he  could. That day, the gunman posted  messages such as ‘‘They Take 1 of Ours  . . . Let’s Take 2 of Theirs.’’ Another  message he posted used the hashtag advocating ‘‘Shoot the Police.’’  Officers Ramos and Liu were not just  nameless people in uniforms either.  Officer Ramos was described by his  family and friends ‘‘as a Puerto Rican  kid who grew up on these streets’’ in  Queens and never stopped trying to  help the people in his community. Officer Ramos had spent the last 10 years  of his life studying to become a chaplain. He was murdered just an hour before his graduation ceremony. Office  Ramos joined the police force at the  age of 37. He explained that he saw the  streets as his ministry and that by protecting and serving his community, he  was serving God as well. Office Ramos  left behind his wife and two sons, 19-  year-old Jaden and 13-year-old Justin.  Officer Liu was the other victim that  day. In many ways, Officer Liu was the  epitome of the American dream. He  was a young boy who at age 12 came  from China to America with his family.  He was a teenage boy who left playground basketball games occasionally  so he could do the shopping for his family’s groceries. He was a young man  who was so inspired by the heroism he  saw on September 11 that he decided he  would become a police officer. He was  the police officer who  called home  every night to let his dad know he had  finished a day of work safely—every  night,  that  is, except December  20,  when the phone call never came. Officer Liu is survived by his wife, whom  he married just 3 months before.  The response of law enforcement to  the savage murders of Officer Ramos  and Officer Liu  should make every  American proud. Over 25,000 police officers traveled from across America and  from parts of Canada to attend the funeral services last month.  We can never really fully repay the  debt of the men and women who sacrifice their very  lives protecting us,  but there are small things we can do to  help the families they leave behind. I  want to call on Congress to take one  small step toward that goal. We should  pass  the Children of Fallen Heroes  Scholarship Act, and we should do so  soon.  The Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act simply provides that any  child whose parent dies in the line of  duty as a member of the armed services  or as a public safety officer would be  entitled to the maximum permissible  scholarship under the Pell Grant Program for their attendance in college.  Five years ago the House of Representatives unanimously passed this  legislation. My  fellow Pennsylvanian  Senator BOBCASEY plans to reintroduce this legislation. I would be cosponsoring this legislation, and I call  on Congress to pick up where it left off  back in 2010 and enact the Children of  Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act.  I also want to take a moment to address the recent spate of protests we  have seen. People have gone out on to  the  streets and across  the country,  often harshly criticizing the officers. I  want to be clear, if people want to protest, they have the right to protest;  and I would never challenge their right  to say what is on their minds or to convey whatever message they would like  VerDate Sep 11 2014  03:04 Jan 14, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G13JA6.045 S13JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T Q 7 6 K S D l n o d a n o d c m e         ",2015

60,Senate,114,0.464,176,2015-01-13,Mr. HELLER.," Mr. President, today I  congratulate  Clark  County  Sheriff  Doug Gillespie of Las Vegas on his retirement. After more than three decades of service to the people of Clark  County, Sheriff Gillespie retired from  public service on January 5, 2015. It  gives me great pleasure to congratulate him on his retirement after his  years of hard work and dedication to  the people of Southern Nevada.  Responsible for the safety of one of  the world’s  top  tourist attractions,  Sheriff Gillespie stands as a shining example of  someone who has devoted  most of his life to serving his community. Born in Pennsylvania and raised  in New York, Sheriff Gillespie’s career  in public service began in 1980 when he  joined the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department as a patrol officer.  Prior to serving as sheriff, he served in  both SWAT and the K–9 unit, eventually working his way to undersheriff in  2003.  In 2006, he was elected Clark County  sheriff, where he served for 8 years.  Sheriff  Gillespie’s  accomplishments,  such as improving the Safe Strip Initiative  to  ensure  tourist  safety,  civilianizing the LVMPD crime lab to  ensure proper investigations, and establishing  the  Fusion  Center  to  streamline and share information with  different agencies, have made Clark  County a stronger and safer community I am proud to represent in the  U.S. Senate. A dedicated police officer  and public servant, Sheriff Gillespie  was recognized by the National Sheriffs’ Association as the 2014 Sheriff of  the Year.  I am grateful for Sheriff Gillespie’s  commitment and dedication to the people of Southern Nevada. He exemplifies  the highest standards of leadership and  community service and should be proud  of his  long and meaningful  career.  Today, I ask that all of my colleagues  join me in congratulating Sheriff Gillespie on his retirement after 34 years,  and I offer my deepest appreciation for  all that he has done for Clark County.  I offer my best wishes to Doug and his  wife Louise, for many successful and  fulfilling years to come.∑  f  MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT  Messages from the President of the  United States were communicated to  the Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.

62,,114,-0.514,197,2015-01-13,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  pleasure that I join the nation in celebrating  the 113th Anniversary of Korean American  Day this January 13, 2015. The Korean American community has been an integral part of  our American fabric, and I am honored to recognize their vital role in shaping communities  throughout our great Nation.  Since  the  first Koreans  arrived  on  the  shores of Honolulu, Hawaii, on  this date  in  1903, they have excelled and shown that the  American Dream is alive. Whether in military,  education, science, business, sports or  the  arts, Korean Americans proved that with hard  work, dedication and zeal for education, they  can thrive and help make America even greater.  My time fighting in the Korean War gave me  an enduring personal connection to Korea and  its people. Since  returning home  from my  service over six decades ago,  I have witnessed South Korea ’s rise from a war-torn nation  to  becoming  the world ’s  13th-largest  economy, a  transformation which has been  largely driven by  the resilience and  industriousness of the Korean people. Here in America, Koreans have inspired us with the same  entrepreneurialism and perseverance  toward  building success and wealth for their communities.  As a native and longtime Congressman of  New York City,  I am proud of  its Korean  American community and the greatness they  contribute to our City and State. I applaud the  services provided by many Korean American  organizations to the Greater New York region,  including free legal and medical help, immigration workshops, scholarship opportunities, and  various cultural events. Koreans raise strong  families and build successful businesses, active civic associations, churches, and charities  that enhance our local economy and culture.  I am proud to serve as Honorary Chairman  of the Congressional Caucus on Korea, and  join my Colleagues and Korean American  friends  in celebrating  their many milestones  and triumphs. The Korean people will always  have a very special place in my heart. I look  forward to the continued friendship I cherish  so much.  f  COMMEMORATING MARIO CUOMO  HON. NITA M.

When Mario, an attorney and law professor  who gained prominence by successfully mediating thorny housing disputes in Corona  and Forest Hills, first ran for Lieutenant  Governor of New York in 1974, Steve and I  promptly jumped into his campaign. He lost.  But Gov. Hugh Carey, recognizing Mario’s  extraordinary talents, appointed him as Secretary of State. (His parents famously asked:  ‘‘Mario—you’re a lawyer and a teacher. How  come you took a job as a secretary?’’)  My first job in public service was in 1975 as  an assistant to Mario Cuomo, working as a  VerDate Sep 11 2014  06:34 Jan 14, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K13JA8.002 E13JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P T 4 K S D n o z e n i t r a m s         ",2015

Under the visionary leadership of Chairman  Tommy McQueeney and tireless efforts of 57  volunteers, the weekend began with a tribute  gala on Friday night as a prelude to the bowl  game on Saturday afternoon at The Citadel’s  Johnson Hagood Stadium. This celebration of  our nation ’s heroes served to raise awareness  of the sacrifices made by our military and their  families. Proceeds from the events are to support  the National Medal of Honor Museum  Foundation and other charities  to help disabled veterans and wounded warriors.  The National Medal of Honor Museum is located on board the USS Yorktown aircraft carrier, permanently docked at the Patriots Point  Naval and Maritime Museum in Mt. Pleasant.  This museum  is home  to  the Congressional  Medal of Honor Society, whose members  have earned our nation ’s highest award  for  military valor, and this weekend ’s bowl game  served as a tribute to them.  f  TOP TEN MISREPORTED STORIES  OF 2014  HON.

67,,114,0.425,204,2015-01-13,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  the  media watchdog  organization Accuracy  in  Media  recently  recounted  the  ‘Top  ten  misreported  and  underreported  stories  of  2014.’ ’  At the top of their list was the media’s failure  to adequately  report on  the Benghazi  scandal. Very few in the media expressed any  interest in covering the attack on our embassy  that led to the death of four Americans including a U.S. ambassador.  Other biased stories on the list include the  media downplaying  the  rise of  the  Islamic  State, portraying Israel as the aggressor in its  dealings with Palestine, and the holdings by  federal judges against President Obama’s actions on immigration and Obamacare.  In December, a  federal  judge  in Pennsylvania ruled that President Obama’s executive  actions on  immigration are unconstitutional.  This was block-buster news but most Americans never heard or read about it.  The media should give the American people  the facts, not cover them up.  f  TRIBUTE TO KENNETH B. HAUCK  HON.

Hauck.  Kenneth B. Hauck  selflessly and  courageously served in the United States Army between October 1942 and May 1946. During  his period of service Kenneth B. Hauck participated in World War II, where he fought in the  Battle of the Bulge with Company B, 112th Infantry Regiment and was a Prisoner of War.  His personal sacrifice and steadfast  loyalty  during this time go unparalleled. For his service he was awarded the American Campaign  Medal, EAME campaign medal, World War II  Victory Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal.  It is an honor to know that such impressive  and dedicated men and women like Kenneth  B. Hauck are willing to sacrifice so much in  the name of freedom.

While  in  the  North Carolina House, I fought tirelessly for women’s reproductive choice.  As the 100th woman in Congress, I will  do the same in the U.S. House. The  fight begins with speaking against this  unconscionable bill.  Mr. FRANKS, women’s health decisions are personal. They should be between a woman, her family, and her  doctor—not the North Carolina House  and not the U.S. House.  H.R. 36 would add barriers for women  who  often  face  complicated, heart-  breaking circumstances. I  join other  women who adamantly oppose this bill,  including many of my Republican colleagues.  Today, I stand with Senators, Representatives, and NARAL activists in  delivering 150,000 American signatures  opposing this bill. I respectfully urge  my colleagues not to support this legislation.  A woman cannot call herself free who  does not own or control her own body.  f  HAPPY BIRTHDAY WILLIAM  TRAMMELL  (Mr. DUNCAN  of South Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

71,House,114,0.737,10,2015-01-21,Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor an American hero, Mr. William  Trammell, born January 28, 1920. A  lifelong resident of Anderson County,  he graduated from Clemson University  in 1941 in the exceptional class of graduates known as the ‘‘wartime class,’’  where 57 of his classmates lost their  lives in World War II. They composed  the backbone of what we understand  today as the Greatest Generation.  Captain Trammell joined the 1st Engineer Amphibian Brigade during the  war, and he was sent to Europe to fight  the Nazis. He participated in the North  Africa invasion, as well as campaigns  in Tunisia, southern Italy, and southern France. Fortunately, he returned  home after 31⁄2years overseas suffering  only minor injuries.  Once home, he pursued the American  Dream. Mr. Trammell successfully operated three businesses, one of which is  still in operation today and operated  by his oldest son, Steve.  Mr. Trammell, along with his wife,  Thelma, worked on  the Eisenhower  campaign. To this day, he represents  the highest quality of individual that  we expect as Americans. He has served  his  community  and  country  with  honor, dignity, and love. Today I would  like to wish Mr. Trammell a happy 95th  birthday.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage the House,  as well as all Americans, to strive to  live life as this exceptional man has  and to dedicate their lives to something greater than themselves.  f  WORKING TOGETHER ON BEHALF  OF AMERICAN PEOPLE  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)

72,House,114,-0.453,10,2015-01-21,Ms. KELLY of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker,  last night President Obama called on  Congress to work together on behalf of  the American people. It is a call I hear  from my constituents in Illinois every  day. So as we begin the 114th Congress,  I rise on their behalf to urge my colleagues to rise above partisanship, to  strengthen our economy and put even  more Americans back to work.  Today, all signs point to our economy being the strongest it has been in  nearly a decade. Businesses are flourishing. We have gained nearly 3 million  new jobs. But there are still 8.7 million  Americans living in the shadow of the  economic  crisis who  are  struggling  with chronic unemployment. They deserve a Congress that is focused and  united in putting them back to work.  Let’s work to reduce the tax burden  on  the middle  class,  putting more  money in their pockets and making it  easier for them to afford their homes  and to send their kids to school so that  the American Dream is within everyone’s reach. Americans want a Congress that can overcome partisan gridlock to put the people first.  I urge my colleagues to put politics  aside, to find a middle ground to help  our middle class and put more Americans on the path to opportunity and  prosperity.  f  YAKIMA COUNTY CELEBRATES  150TH ANNIVERSARY  (Mr. NEWHOUSE  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

The Washington Territorial Legislature  created Yakima County  in  1865, nearly 25 years before Washington  itself became a State.  I  am  a  third-generation Yakima  County farmer. My family and I continue to operate a 600-acre farm near  the city of Sunnyside. Even before the  creation of Yakima County, the agricultural industry recognized the vast  environmental benefits of the region.  Today, agriculture remains the  lifeblood of Yakima County’s economy,  and I am pleased to represent those interests before the House Committee on  Agriculture.  Today marks Yakima County’s sesquicentennial. Happy 150th birthday. It  is an honor to represent you in Congress.  f  FREE TRADE DEALS DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT COMMUNITIES  OF COLOR  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)

77,House,114,0.303,24,2015-01-21,Mr. WHITFIELD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would just like to clarify that H.R.  161 is certainly not any drastic piece of  legislation.  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 designated the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission as the lead agency charged  with coordinating and reviewing natural gas pipeline project applications;  therefore, FERC conducts the environmental review of each project as required under  the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, and is given  authority to set deadlines  for other  agencies to issue an approval or denial  of an associated permit.  When these applications are filed at  FERC, the application also is given to  other agencies that may have jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act, maybe  like the Corps of Engineers, the Clean  Air Act, the EPA perhaps, or Endangered Species; so it is not like they just  have 90 days to look at this. They get  the application the same time as FERC  does.  The problem that FERC has had—and  they have had both Democrat and Republican Commissioners come to Congress and say that they need more authority over these other agencies, so  this bill does precisely that.  Once FERC has made a final determination and completed its process, it  gives the other agencies another 90  days—even  though  they  have  been  working on it for a year in advance of  that—another 90 days to complete it,  and if they want another 30 days, then  they can do that as well.  I would just say that this is not rushing the process; it is simply completing  the 2005 Energy Policy Act that gives  FERC authority. We give them authority, but we don’t give them any enforcement mechanism, and so this is  precisely what this legislation does.  I might also add that having deadlines for agencies to act when doing environmental reviews or issuing permits  is not really that strange or unique of  an idea. Canada, Australia, and most  European Union nations have deadlines  for  their  environmental  regulatory  agencies to act.  Any person that is doing any kind of  business  in America knows  the bureaucracy that we all run into, and it is  easy  to  criticize  bureaucracies. We  know that they are dedicated, committed citizens trying to protect the  environment,  protect  the American  people, and we  commend  them  for  doing that, but we also know that they  frequently let things slide.  It is easy to lose the process. We hear  common  complaints—nonstop—about  delay, delay, delay. We know  from  hearings on this—this bill has already  passed the House once—but we know  from hearings that the Northeastern  United States is really vulnerable to  not having sufficient natural gas to  meet their needs.  They  are  closing  nuclear  power  plants. The President is making sure  you can’t build a new coal plant in  America. Existing coal plants, many of  them are going to be going out of business because of extreme regulations of  this climate-driven administration. We  have heard testimony about the escalating prices of electricity for people.  This is designed to provide the infrastructure to get the natural gas where  it needs to be, and the Northeast is one  of those areas. That is really what this  bill is about. It is about giving FERC  some real authority, setting in statute  that these agencies must act within a  certain amount of time.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2015
78,House,114,-0.402,24,2015-01-21,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I really don’t understand. I respect  my colleague from Kentucky a great  deal, but he seems to be arguing that  we need the deadlines in this bill to  hold Federal agencies accountable and  ensure that they don’t just somehow  sit on the applications.  As I have already noted, since 2009,  FERC has completed action on 91 percent of natural gas pipeline applications within 12 months, so a 12-month  deadline isn’t needed for more than 90  percent of the applicants.  My colleagues have asked: Well, what  is the problem with holding the remaining 9 percent to a 12-month deadline? Well, the problem is it becomes a  one-size-fits-all approach that fails to  consider a wide range of applications  that FERC has to review.  Some of the applications are for new  projects—again,  a  small  number—  which span hundreds of miles, cross  waterways  and wetlands,  and  pass  through neighborhoods and habitats of  threatened wildlife; and questions of  eminent domain need to be considered.  In these cases, there can be unresolved  safety, environmental, and legal issues  at the local or State level.  Again, as I said, the President has  said that he would veto this bill. In the  Statement of Administration Policy,  they specifically say:  The  small percentage of decisions  that  have taken longer than 1 year involve complex proposals that merit additional review  and consideration.  Mr. Speaker, if there is a complex  project or there is some unaddressed  risk to safety or the environment, we  need to allow FERC or other Federal  agencies the time to ensure that the  pipeline is safe, so we don’t have an accident like what occurred in Edison,  New Jersey, in my district.  The last thing anyone needs, including the pipeline owner, is a pipeline explosion or other dangerous pipeline  malfunction, and these things have occurred. I witnessed it myself in my district.  I am just saying don’t put a hard  deadline on the most complex projects  that raise the possibility that FERC  will be  forced to approve a pipeline  that is not safe or to reject an application  solely because  the Commission  lacks sufficient time for an adequate  review that will hinder rather than  help us get more natural gas where it  needs to go.  Now, my colleague also mentioned  the  issue about the Northeast electricity  supply or prices, and  I  just  wanted to address that concern. New  England is using more natural gas to  generate electricity and more natural  gas for heating homes than in the past,  and on the coldest winter days, when  natural gas is needed for heating or  electricity, there is more demand, but  this bill doesn’t do anything to solve  that problem.  The problem in New England isn’t  caused by pipeline applications that  take  too  long  to  get  approved  by  FERC; the problem is that the pipeline  companies aren’t even submitting the  applications because they haven’t figured out who is going to pay for these  new pipelines. The pipeline companies  haven’t been satisfied there is a sufficient year-round demand to justify and  finance the pipelines.  That is an issue that FERC is looking at and has been holding stakeholder conferences about, but this has  nothing to do with Mr. POMPEO’s bill.  b1445  Cutting corners on the permitting  process isn’t going to help additional  pipeline capacity built for the Northeast.  I don’t think we ought to be  blaming  the  government  for  every  problem, which is what I hear my colleagues on the Republican side doing.  The reality is that FERC and the government didn’t create this problem. It  is a problem of economics, and the faster we understand that the faster we can  try to find a solution, but let’s not act  as if FERC’s inability to act is the  problem here. That is not the case.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2015

I stand here today in defense of the  thousands of unborn children whose  lives were ended through no fault of  their own. These children are precious  gifts and cannot defend  themselves.  They do not have the luxury to debate  whether or not society should recognize them as living beings.  As a Christian and the proud father  also of three children, I strongly believe in the sanctity of life and that it  begins at conception. My heart aches  for the thousands of unborn children  who will never have that chance to experience the wonder of life.  Life  is  truly  a miracle  granted  through the grace of nature’s God, and  I am here today to say every life is a  gift and every life does matter.  It has been 42 years since the Supreme Court made their ruling in Roe  v. Wade. Since that ruling, an estimated—and I want to repeat this, an  estimated—55 million lives have been  lost. That is more than the total population of the northeast States. That is  more than the population of the State  of California.  Future generations will  look back  and judge us. They will judge us on our  failure to protect the most innocent  among us. They will judge us for allowing infanticide, human genocide of our  next generation yet to come.  This week, the defenders of life in the  thousands have and will come to Washington, D.C., to support the sanctity of  life. This has grown into the largest  pro-life event in the world. I want them  to know we will keep fighting to defend  the silent, unborn child.  How can we as a nation—how can we  as a nation—have laws that protect the  embryo of a sea turtle or bald eagle but  yet refuse to protect the same of our  own species? Shouldn’t the lives of the  unborn children matter as much as  these in the eyes of the law?  These lives, these gifts, these human  beings deserve to be protected and defended.  ",2015

85,Senate,114,-0.362,52,2015-01-21,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President,  last  night the President talked about the  economy and  the progress we have  made. The United States grew 2.6 percent last year, and in the third quarter  alone our economy grew by 5 percent.  Nearly 3 million jobs were created—the  best year for the U.S. labor market  since the height of the economic boom  under President Bill Clinton. Lower  gasoline prices are providing relief to  many  families  and  consumer  confidence is up. The deficit has been cut  in half.  Yet we know that while the economy  is growing and unemployment is declining, sadly, much of the benefit is  going to those at the very top of the  ladder. The top 1 percent of American  wage earners saw 49 percent of the decline in incomes during the recession,  but they have seen 95 percent of the income gained since the recovery started.  Let me repeat that. The top 1 percent  of wage earners have seen 95 percent of  the gains since our economy has recovered.  The gap between wages for low-income and middle-income families and  those at the top is staggering. Forty-  seven people  in America own more  than 160 million Americans combined.  That has to change.  This isn’t just a Democratic observation. Even Republicans have publicly  agreed with us that working families  are falling behind. Let me quote a few.  Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a  potential candidate for President, said:  ‘‘Here’s  reality:  If you’re  fortunate  enough to count yourself among the  privileged, much of the rest of the Nation is drowning.’’ Jeb Bush said that.  Mitt Romney, a former Republican  candidate for President and perhaps a  Republican  candidate  for President  again—here is what he said last week  as he has rekindled his dream for the  Presidency: ‘‘. . . the rich have gotten  richer,  income  inequality has gotten  worse, and there are more people in  poverty than ever before.’’  Even Speaker JOHN this in an interview:  BOEHNER said  The top third of America are doing pretty  good. The bottom two-thirds are really being  squeezed.  So how do we address these challenges? Our parties  look at  it differently.  MARKEY The Republican majority  in  this  Chamber had to pick the first bill they  would bring to the floor of the Senate  once they reached the majority. There  were a  lot of  initiatives they could  have considered. We know what they  chose—the Keystone XL Pipeline—a  pipeline owned by a Canadian company. That is the No. 1 priority of the  Republicans in the Senate, bar none.  When they wanted to respond to President Obama’s State of the Union Address with Senator ERNSTof Iowa, they  focused on the Keystone XL Pipeline.  What a limited vision of the future—  one pipeline.  Then we took two votes yesterday on  this pipeline, and it started to become  clear what this pipeline is all about. It  is moving Canadian  tar  sands  from  Canada,  through  the United States,  and to a refinery in Texas. We learned  yesterday  the Republicans will not  even support the proposition that the  refined oil products coming out of this  refinery will help America.  We had a simple amendment Senator  of  Massachusetts  offered  which said that at the end of the pipeline, the refinery’s oil products will be  sold in America. The Republicans defeated that amendment. So all this argument about how this oil out of this  pipeline is going to help our economy  in the future? Nope, don’t expect it to  happen. Yesterday’s overwhelming Republican vote made it clear.  There was a second part that was  considered  yesterday. This  bill—the  No. 1 priority of the Senate Republican  majority—is going to build a pipeline,  that is for sure. We said, good, if it is  going to be built, use American steel in  building the pipeline. That is not an  outrageous suggestion. If this is such a  priority for the Republicans, wouldn’t  they want to put Americans to work to  make the steel to build the pipeline?  We offered that as an amendment yesterday. Senator FRANKENoffered that  amendment and the Republicans rejected it. The Republicans rejected the  premise that the steel that goes into  the most important pipeline in the history of America, from their point of  view, should actually come from America. That is the second amendment we  considered.  This  special  interest  project,  the  Keystone XL Canadian-owned pipeline,  is going to continue to be the No. 1  dominant issue in the Senate for days  to come.  Republicans plan to do everything  they can to help build a pipeline, but  they want to deny millions of Americans access to health care. That  is  what the House Republicans have come  up with. They want to come up with a  plan that will literally take away the  coverage of health care from Americans. Is there anyone in this country  who thinks that is the right thing for  our future? We are trying to reduce the  number of uninsured. The Republican  changes to the Affordable Care Act  would  increase the number of uninsured  and  increase  the  number  of  Americans dependent on government-  sponsored health care. It doesn’t sound  like a Republican idea to me, but it is.  That is what is coming from the House  of Representatives.  There are pretty clear differences in  how we help working families. For the  Senate Republicans, it is to build a Canadian pipeline. Don’t use American  steel, don’t keep the oil in America,  but build this pipeline—No. 1 priority.  The House Republicans  take  away  health insurance coverage for hundreds  of thousands of Americans at a time  when we know that leaves people in a  precarious position.  Here is what the President said last  night: We want to make certain we  focus on projects and programs and  new ideas that can leave our children a  better world and our grandchildren as  well. Do we want an economy where everyone has an opportunity to climb  that economic ladder or do we want a  world where those who are born into  lives of luxury set the rules and always  come out ahead? Do we want an economy that rewards those who work hard  and play by the rules or an economy  where corporations rig the game so it  is tails you lose, heads I win?  We know that an economy with a  strong middle class is key to growing  America. Yet it is becoming harder and  harder for families to even reach the  middle class. Working families aren’t  looking  for  a handout—not  in my  State. They just want a chance for a  better life for their kids.  There is a way we can do this. It is  called the earned-income tax credit.  This is an idea supported by Republican Presidents in the past. Historically both parties have supported it.  The earned-income tax credit  is designed to encourage work by providing  a tax credit to working families.  The President’s proposal, similar to  one that SHERRODBROWNand I have introduced, would expand the credit to  help the only group that our Tax Code  pushes into poverty: childless workers.  What a difference this would make for  millions of working families, the difference between paying a heating bill  or putting it off, the difference between  getting a prescription filled or waiting.  A small refundable tax credit for these  workers can make a bigger difference  than many U.S. Senators would ever  realize.  The President also proposed making  2 years of community college free for  responsible students and giving motivated students a path to a solid educational foundation without debt. This  is not a Democratic idea. The President acknowledged last night that this  idea came from a Republican Governor  in Tennessee. I might add that a Democratic mayor, Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, has a similar program, but the  President went  to Tennessee  to acknowledge that the Republican legislature and the Republican Governor had  come up with a good idea. So to argue  this is somehow a partisan idea, it sure  isn’t in Tennessee. If it is partisan, it is  a Republican partisan idea.

86,Senate,114,0.34,59,2015-01-21,Mr. HOEVEN.," Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to my  esteemed colleague from the State of  Illinois.  Of course the answer to the question  is that in fact it is a regulated substance, and it is primarily regulated at  the State and local level.  In the State of Illinois, for example,  petcoke would be  regulated by  the  State of Illinois. What I understand the  Senator from Illinois to be saying is  that he is dissatisfied with the way the  State of Illinois has chosen to regulate  petcoke.  But in fact the EPA has found that  petcoke has a low hazard potential. According to the Congressional Research  Service, most  toxicity  analysis  of  petcoke, as referenced by EPA, finds it  has low health hazard potential in humans, has no observed carcinogenic, reproductive or developmental effects. In  fact, it is a byproduct of not just oil  from the oil sands but also some of the  oils  from California, Venezuela, and  other places.  So it is a byproduct that in fact is recycled. It is used in products such as  aluminum, steel, paint. It is used to  produce electricity.  Here is a case of a product that actually can be and is in fact recycled. I  would argue that what we want to do  as we produce energy is continue to invest  in these new technologies that  will help us produce more energy but  also do it with better environmental  stewardship, which means we not only  work on CCS, carbon capture and storage—which is a major undertaking in  the oil sands right now; and I would be  willing to engage in that discussion as  well—but then also work to find uses  for these byproducts in things such as  steel and aluminum.  For example, the President last night  talked about how the auto industry is  making a resurgence, and he talked  about the CAFE standards. One of the  things they are doing in Detroit with  new automobiles  is  they are using  more aluminum in the construction of  the cars to reduce the weight to try to  meet those CAFE standards.  So here  is a product  from the oil  sands oil that is actually used in aluminum to make those vehicles lighter  to achieve one of the things the President talked about in the State of the  Union Address last night as a byproduct from the oil sands oil.  So I appreciate the question and look  forward to further dialogue.  ",2015

88,Senate,114,-0.374,66,2015-01-21,Mr. LEAHY.," I thank my friend from  North Dakota for his usual courtesy  shown earlier. Unfortunately, I had a  nose bleed, and  I had  to  stop my  speech. I think I am not used to the  elevation—the altitude of the Senate—  but after over 40 years I should be.  I was saying earlier, I had hoped we  begin this 114th Congress by showing  the American people that Congress is  putting  the  needs  of  hard-working  American families first. I wish we were  considering legislation to support the  Highway Trust Fund. That supports  tens of thousands of jobs around the  country in every one of our States. I  wish we were considering tax legislation to bring investments to our small  local businesses and encouraging energy efficiency in construction and investment. I wish we were finding places  to support the educational pursuits of  our children. I would like to maintain  our status as a premier leader on the  world stage.  Instead, we are considering legislation that puts Canadian tar sands—  which are intended for export, not to  be used in the United States—as our  priority. The pipeline will support 35  permanent jobs—just 35—not hundreds,  not thousands—35. I would like to be  considering  legislation  that  creates  thousands of jobs. It is hard not to  question whether the new Senate majority is truly focused on the needs of  hardworking Americans.  Some who  support  the  legislation  claim  the pipeline  is  truly  ‘‘shovel  ready.’’ They claim the project has  been thoroughly studied and analyzed,  and that the Administration sat for 6  years with no decision on the permit.  Even before the Nebraska Supreme  Court recently released its decision on  the location of this pipeline, the Republican leadership said this should be  our priority even ahead of that decision. The decision did not clarify lingering questions about the process. In  fact, the majority of the justices said  the decision to circumvent the public  process and block Nebraskans’ ability  to raise concerns about the pipeline  was  unconstitutional.  Four  of  the  seven justices said that it is unconstitutional under State law. But in their  state procedure, you need a  supermajority of 5 of the 7 justices to halt  this project, so the landowners’ appeal  was rejected.  What bothers me is not only that the  majority opinion is being ignored in  Nebraska but that the legislation approved last week by the House in consideration here would remove consideration of all appeals. You have to take  them out of local Federal courts and  put them before the DC Circuit.  In  other words,  if you are  in a State  where this pipeline goes through your  community and you have a question,  you would have to make an appeal to  the DC Circuit. What that is saying is  that  Congress  believes  that Washington knows best. Frankly, the people  in my State of Vermont—and I suspect  in States across the country—would  prefer  to  trust  the courts  in  their  States.  We ought to be showing the American people that Congress cares more  about  the  public  process  and  the  public’s access to their courts, than  about the wishes of foreign special interests. That is why I have offered an  amendment that would strike the judicial review provision and restore the  role of local federal district courts in  reviewing challenges arising from the  Keystone Pipeline.  The majority  leader  promised  an  open debate and open amendment process. I appreciate that. I certainly have  concerns  about  circumventing what  would be normal court procedure and  the President’s approval process, and I  want to be able to address that. But  more than that, I hope this debate can  be an open and honest conversation,  not about a pipeline that supports special interests but about the direction  in which our country is moving on sustainable energy, on job creation, and  on issues as fundamental to all Americans—Republicans  or Democrats—as  who will have access to our courts. Will  it just be special interests or will it be  the American  people?  I  prefer  the  American people.  I yield the floor.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mrs.  ERNST). The Senator from Louisiana.

89,Senate,114,0.495,66,2015-01-21,Mr. VITTER.," Madam President,  I  have an amendment on this important  bill at the desk, amendment No. 80. I  am not going to offer that amendment  now because the minority side is blocking the offering and calling up of additional amendments until we dispose of  those presently called up. I want to do  that right now. But hopefully, I will be  doing that in the very near future. I  look forward to a full debate and a vote  on this amendment, probably  in the  next tranche of amendments on the  bill.  My amendment is about energy. It is  about a very crucial part of the domestic policy, something I believe will absolutely be a huge positive incentive  and factor to allow us to produce even  more American energy, to become even  more energy independent, and to provide an even greater boost to our economy; that is, through revenue sharing,  sharing the revenue produced by domestic energy production with the producing States.  That is fair for two reasons: one, because those producing States do bear  costs and burdens and impacts, including environmental impacts, and, two,  providing that incentive is the most  important way we can boost even further important domestic energy production. That  energy  production  is  vital for our country and our economy.  In fact, we are not in recession right  now because of those U.S. energy jobs.

90,Senate,114,-0.389,73,2015-01-21,Mrs. GILLIBRAND.," Mr. President, I  rise today to propose three important  amendments to S. 1, the Keystone XL  Pipeline Act.  First of all, I want to make it very  clear that I strongly oppose the Keystone XL Pipeline plan. I have serious  concern about the effects this project  would have on our health and safety; I  have serious concerns about the environmental impact; and I am skeptical  of the real, permanent jobs it could  create.  This project has many risks and very  few advantages, and I will be voting  against it. But if this legislation does  pass the Senate, we should at least try  to make it a better bill. There is no excuse why we cannot turn the Keystone  XL Pipeline Act into an opportunity to  protect our clean drinking water and  ensure that polluters have to pay to  clean up their own messes.  First, I have offered amendment No.  48, which would  remove  the Halliburton loophole from the Safe Drinking Water Act and finally require gas  storage and gas drilling companies to  comply with our clean water  laws.  Every other industry has to do it. Our  farmers have to do  it. Construction  companies have to do it. Yet our gas  companies have been exempt for years.  It should give my colleagues pause  that fracking companies are allowed to  ignore our clean water laws when they  pump chemicals deep into the ground.  In this country, when we turn on the  tap for a glass of water, we need to  know that our drinking water is safe.  So let’s be fair and hold the gas industry to the same environmental and  public health  standards as everyone  else.  Second,  I  worked  with  Senator  MENENDEZon amendment No. 65, which  would make oil companies financially  responsible for the damages they cause  when they spill on our land and leak  into our waterways. Under current law,  when an onshore oilspill occurs, the  company that causes the spill is only  liable for $350 million in damages, including cleanup and compensation. Yet  a major oilspill into a river or lake,  such as the one this week in Montana,  could  easily  result  in damage well  above that arbitrary limit.  Hard-working taxpayers should never  be stuck paying for an oil company’s  mess, and local property and businesses  should not have to slog through endless  litigation just to get the compensation  they deserve from a negligent oil company. This amendment would finally  place the burden on companies to clean  up after themselves.  Third, I have proposed amendment  No. 76, which would allow our homeowners  and  business  owners whose  property has been damaged by natural  disaster to use Federal disaster assistance funds to upgrade their property’s  energy efficiency. Under current law,  the disaster assistance can only be  used to replace what was lost even if  that property was antiquated and not  up to current standards. We need to  have much more forward-looking policies that actually make sense.  Due to the effects of climate change,  we have seen a growing number of natural disasters  in recent years,  from  blizzards, to hurricanes, to raging fires,  to endless droughts. When we pick up  the pieces after a major storm, we  want to make sure that when we rebuild, we rebuild in the smartest way  possible, and that  includes not only  protections against the next disaster  but also proactive measures to save energy,  reduce  emissions,  and  lower  costs.  As I said, I don’t support the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline,  but if this new Congress is intent on  sending this bill to the President, then  we need to make sure the bill keeps our  drinking water safe, holds companies  accountable for their own messes, and  encourages efficiency in our economy.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2015

For the first time we will go on record  saying the following: Climate change is  real and human activity contributes to  climate change.  What  a  breath  of  fresh  air  this  amendment  is, and I urge an  ‘‘aye’’  vote very strongly.  The front part of the amendment accurately quotes the EIS, parts of which  a lot of us agree with and parts of  which we don’t. Let it be known that  the parts we don’t agree with are under  review by various agencies, but this is  accurate. This is a quote from the current EIS.  You are not voting to endorse the  EIS, you are just voting to acknowledge that is what it says. But you are  voting on original language written by  Senator HOEVEN that  says  climate  change is real and human activity contributes to it.  I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote.  ",2015
96,,114,-0.606,122,2015-01-21,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  recognize Colonel David Arthur Lerps, USMC  (RET), who died on October 21, 2014 after a  long and valiant struggle with Parkinson’s disease, and his career of service to our nation.  Born in Chicago, Illinois on June 28, 1931,  he spent his early years in Eastchester, New  York and was an honors graduate of Duke  University where he was Commandant of the  Naval Battalion and participated in every sport,  winning distinction as quarterback of the 1954  Blue Demons Football Team. His flight training  at NAS Pensacola prepared him  for many  years in the Marine Air Wing. During his 30-  year military career, he served three tours in  Japan and  flew 312 missions  in Vietnam  in  1968, where he was awarded 23 Air Medals  and  nominated  for  a Distinguished Flying  Cross  for valor  in an especially dangerous  mission to the DMZ.  He later served in strategic planning at the  Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, DC; was  both student and teacher at the Marine Corps  Command and Staff College; and attended the  Industrial College of the Armed Forces while  gaining his MBA at George Washington University. He concluded his active duty as Chief  of Staff, LFTC Pacific Naval Amphibious Base,  Coronado.  Upon retiring from active duty in 1984, he  was appointed Chief of Staff at the Academy  of  the Pacific, a post he held  for 18 years.  After retiring from AOP, he became a student  once again, studying Shakespeare and music  at the University of Hawaii.  Col. Lerps was a board member of Hawaii  Opera Theater and member of  the Hawaii  Wagner Society. He was an ardent ocean  canoe paddler, a board member of the Lanikai  Canoe Club and  coordinator of  the Duke  Kahanamoku Long Distance Canoe Race for  four years.  Even with the decline in mobility and speech  and the loss of the ability to swallow, he never  lost his deep  love  for opera, sports,  for his  family, Catholic  faith and Marine Corps. As  life-long  friend John Schwarz wrote,  ‘Dave  never really left the Corps . . . ‘once a Marine  always a Marine.’ He was ‘SEMPER Fl,’ a Marine to his final breath!’ ’  Dave  is survived by Mary, his wife of 55  years, his children Kathy Lerps, Karen Pittman, Robert Lerps, six grandchildren: Vito and  Dylan Higgins, Ashley Snow, Amber Lerps,  Kylie and Kassidy Barker; and a sister Ann  Falkenberg and brother Kurt Lerps. I learned  of Col. Lerps’ life of service from his brother-  in-law and my good  friend Father Robert  Oldershaw.  f  HONORING BISHOP GORDON  ARLESTER HUMPHREY, JR.  HON.

97,House,114,-0.399,3,2015-01-27,Mr. KILDEE.," Madam Speaker, it is  now week 4 in the new Republican Congress. There is still no jobs bill anywhere in sight. Instead of taking up an  infrastructure bill or a minimum wage  bill to give working  families bigger  paychecks, we are seeing a dangerous  immigration bill  that will actually  hurt our Nation’s security.  Next week, Republican leadership is  abandoning a bipartisan border security bill from the last Congress and instead trying to pass an irresponsible  and unworkable $10 billion bill that  simply appeases  the extreme voices  within their caucus.  Border security experts say this bill  would  be  ineffective. They  call  it  unserious and dangerous for our Nation’s security. Secretary Jeh Johnson  says that if enacted, it would actually  leave the border less secure.  This does not combat threats or secure our border. It simply requires the  Federal Government to spend billions  of dollars of taxpayer money on unnecessary projects.  If we really wanted to do something  here in this House about border security, let’s bring up the Border Security  Results Act  that was  unanimously  passed by the Homeland Security Committee in the last Congress, bipartisan  and unanimous, and it would get things  done.  f  OPERATION TAXPAYER INITIATIVE  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2015
98,House,114,0.427,3,2015-01-27,Mr. GUINTA.," Madam Speaker, Granite Staters are fed up with Washington’s wasteful ways. The government’s  irresponsible spending has led to billions of your dollars being wasted to  fund projects that already exist. Instead of ensuring that the most truly  in need receive a hand up, your taxpayer dollars are instead being handed  out to increase Washington’s bureaucracy.  That is why I have launched Operation TAXPAYER, an ongoing initiative designed to eliminate the wasteful  plaguing of our government, running  up our debt, and crowding out funding  for worthwhile programs.  As part of this initiative, I have introduced H. Res. 45, a bipartisan bill to  fundamentally alter the way  legislation is brought to the House floor.  Under H. Res. 45, every piece of legislation awaiting consideration by Congress would receive a duplication score  by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, with the goal of providing Members the necessary knowledge to identify whether or not a new  bill creates a new program or project  that already exists within our government.  This  is a commonsense, bipartisan  step that will allow our government to  finally take sizable bites out of our  debt and deficit while ensuring the protection of safety nets for all Americans.  f  SECURE OUR BORDER ACT WILL  COMPOUND SECURITY CONCERNS  (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2015
99,House,114,-0.345,3,2015-01-27,Mr. HIGGINS.," Madam Speaker, cancellation of this week’s vote of the Secure Our Border Act  is a relief  for  northern border communities, including my western New York district.  This legislation would require a biometric exit  system at every border  crossing which would duplicate inspections and significantly slow the flow of  people and goods across the northern  border.  The Beyond the Border agreement already allows for exit data to be shared  between Canadian and U.S. officials;  thus, the implementation of this system at the northern border would be  redundant at least.  Already congested border crossings,  such as the Peace Bridge in western  New York, would  see  longer delays  which would ultimately create disastrous economic effects and compound  security concerns. A Peace Bridge authority official said that implementation of this program would effectively  shut down the northern border.  Investments in personnel and infrastructure should be made along our  borders, but we must take into consideration the unique needs of northern  and southern border communities and  protect the strong economic relationship that  is essential to the United  States and Canadian economies.  f  THE WORLD NEEDS RELIGIOUS  FREEDOM  (Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend her remarks.)  Mrs. MCMORRIS RODGERS. Madam  Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that  I join in remembering one of the darkest stains on the history of the world.  Today, on  International Holocaust  Remembrance Day, we pay homage to  the lives that were lost and remember  the freedom that triumphed the day  the death camps were  liberated. On  this day 70 years ago, thousands of  prisoners were liberated at Auschwitz,  the Nazi death camp where over a million Jews lost their lives.  In all, more than 6 million Jews were  killed by the Nazis, wiping out a part  of European culture that existed for  more than a thousand years. Today,  Europe confronts a new wave of anti-  Semitism as we witnessed in the murders recently at the kosher market in  Paris.  What the world needs  is religious  freedom and the promotion of faith as  a force for good. We also need strong  military alliances that suppress racial  hatred and genocide whenever it raises  its ugly head.  After the death camps were liberated,  Jews still confronted an anti-Semitic  Europe, and they made their way to  Israel. When they fought for the war of  independence in 1948, half the soldiers  were survivors from the death camps.  Today, when we remember the victims, let us also remember that it was  the  liberation of the survivors that  helped found a new state: the state of  tolerance,  democracy,  and  freedom  that Israel so proudly embodies.  f  REMEMBERING JERRY ‘‘J.R.’’  MCBRIDE  (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  VerDate Sep 11 2014  08:52 Feb 03, 2015 Jkt 000000 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD15\H27JA5.REC H27JA5 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w D O R P 1 N V T Q 7 D K S D     ",2015

101,House,114,0.407,10,2015-01-27,Mr. PAULSEN.,"  I  tleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, it is easy and comfortable to think that sex trafficking  only happens in countries outside the  United States. The truth is that more  than 100,000 are at risk of being trafficked for commercial sex here in the  United States each and every year,  here in America.  We have a word for a situation when  one group of people is dehumanized and  has their basic human rights snuffed  out for someone else’s economic gain.  That word is slavery. The problem we  have today is not a thing of the past. It  is not from some remote corner of the  world that you can’t find on a map.  Slavery in the form of human trafficking is happening right now. It is  happening in our cities, suburbs, and  rural communities. It is happening in  each and every one of our congressional districts.  I am sad to say that Minneapolis,  Minnesota, my home State, has actually been listed as one of the 13th largest centers for sexual exploitation of  children in the entire country.  I realize how critical it is to educate  our  community about what  I have  learned from talking to victims like  Dayanna, who became a  13-year-old  trafficking victim. Dayanna didn’t get  a lot of love and attention from her  mother or family.  While she took  it upon herself to  take care of her brothers and sisters,  she longed for someone to give her love  and attention. She ended up being seduced by a man who promised to be her  ‘‘boyfriend.’’  Guess what? At age 13, within days  after running away with him, she found  herself being trafficked in Chicago and  Philadelphia, without a home and separated from her family. Only a daring  jump from a second-story window actually allowed her to escape.  Many might think that if Dayanna  had come from a different family situation, she wouldn’t have been trafficked;  sadly, that is not the case.

102,House,114,-0.565,31,2015-01-27,Mr. HASTINGS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  You know, I don’t want to in any way  disparage the  lovefest of my  friends  from Texas.  I recognize that everything is big in Texas.  Also, as a child, I even learned the  songs of Texas, ‘‘The Yellow Rose of  Texas,’’ ‘‘Deep in the Heart of Texas,’’  a whole of bunch of them which I hold  dear from my childhood.  I would like to have the gentleman  who was called upon as a foreign affairs  expert—because he serves on the Foreign  Affairs  Committee—to  know,  then, that I guess I too am a foreign affairs expert since I served on that committee for 8 years, served on the Intelligence Committee for 8 years. All of  the countries that the gentleman mentioned, I have been to.  I assuredly never got an answer from  the chairman or anyone else regarding  whether or not Ukraine—and it is not  ‘‘the Ukraine’’; it is ‘‘Ukraine’’—didn’t  get an answer as to whether they were  prepared to receive  liquefied natural  gas.  I also know that we are mindful of  the sanctions on Russia and how it is  impacting them.  I didn’t only just go to Ukraine. In  their  first election after the Orange  Revolution,  I was  the  lead election  monitor for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  I don’t come to this dance without  having  some  understanding,  and  I  would urge that I still didn’t get—although my  friend,  the  chairman,  seemed to suggest that the President is  deserving of something that he earns,  my belief is that the President has allowed for more gas leases than I would  have had him do.  I would urge that just off the press,  embargoed until noon today, is a press  release from the United States Department of the Interior, which receives a  lot of negative comment from my colleagues regarding regulations.  ‘‘Interior  Department  Announces  Draft  Strategy for Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing.’’ The draft proposal program includes 14 potential lease sales in eight  planning areas—10 sales in the Gulf of  Mexico, three off the coast of Alaska,  and one in a portion of the mid- and  south Atlantic.  Now, let me make it very clear. That  might make a whole  lot of people  happy. It does not make me happy because they are discussing leases in the  Gulf of Mexico where, I believe, there  is  substantial  infrastructure  from  areas like Louisiana and Texas in the  western portion of the gulf. I guess we  just ignore things like the BP oil spill,  and we ignore the potential for those  kinds of disasters.  So I can’t disagree very much with  the chairman regarding much of his  statistics, but I want the administration and my  friend  from Texas, the  chairman, to know that, as I have said  repeatedly, I will be the last person  standing in this House of Representatives opposed to offshore drilling in my  State of Florida no matter the views  that others have.  I believe there  is  enough  wind  from  our  respective  oceans to double the amount of energy  that we have, and, yes, my  friend,  there are aircraft  that are powered  without fossil fuel.  We were originally  scheduled  this  week to also consider a border security  bill, but that bill was scuttled yesterday amidst a number of things.  My  friends,  the Republicans,  are  pretty lucky. As bad as the snowstorm  is, particularly for the New England  area of our country, many of our colleagues could not get back here yesterday and probably won’t be able to get  back here today as well. The reason I  say they are lucky is they can hide—by  pulling the border bill—under the fact  that there was a snowstorm and people  couldn’t get in here, and that is legitimate, in my view.  The other part of the concern—and  we will see about it next week and the  week after—is that many conservatives  in the Republican Party are jumping  ship on the border bill, and that was  out there as well. Just like last week,  just like last Congress, there is a rift in  the majority, leaving it unable to even  pass legislation that all of its Members  can agree on.  Unfortunately, we have real problems  in this country that my  friends are  going to have to address. So I look forward to my friends’ plan to repair our  crumbling roads and bridges  in this  country, and I can’t wait to see how  this body will combat the national security  threat of climate change,  in  spite of all of your denials.  I hope that my friends intend to ensure that women receive equal pay for  equal work, and  I  look  forward  to  working with my colleagues to make  sure that many of the reforms in our  tax structure allow for those persons  who are ultrawealthy to pay their fair  proportion of what they earn and to reform our Tax Code so that middle-income Americans can benefit and poor  Americans can rise to the middle class.  With America’s workers’ wages stagnant  for so  long,  including our own  here in the House of Representatives,  we are entering the seventh year without any increase in wages. And those of  us who are poorer Members of Congress  have experienced the kinds of difficulties of just being here in Washington  and the cost for being here. I am seeking no sympathies. It is just a fact.  So with those wages stagnant for so  long, I look forward to hearing from  my colleagues on how they plan to  raise the minimum wage in this country. Because until my friends can address their dysfunction and inability to  lead, I am afraid our country is in for  2 more years of uncertainty.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on  the rule and the underlying bill.  Mr. Speaker,  I will reiterate that  most Presidents get a lot of credit on  their watch and a lot of negative when  things go wrong. For once, our gas  prices are down, and my friends can’t  even bring themselves to say that this  President deserves some credit. I do. I  see it. He deserves some credit.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2015
103,House,114,-0.313,38,2015-01-27,Mr. GARAMENDI.," Mr. Speaker, this  chart has been up, really, for the last 4  years, and I keep bringing it back because it is pretty important. This is  about American jobs, about how we can  rebuild  the American economy, and  about how we can, at the same time,  provide  employment  opportunities—  those middle class  jobs that we all  want to talk about—and do it in a way  that actually  improves our environment.  Today, I want to focus on one part of  this. I have asked some of my colleagues to join us, and Congresswoman  HAHNwill be joining us in a few moments to talk about a piece of this.  In the Make It In America agenda,  we have  these  items:  international  trade, which  is critically  important  that we do right; tax policies of all  kinds; our energy policy. Oh. By the  way, in the last 5 years, the energy policy of the administration’s has almost  made the United States energy independent. We are actually producing 4  billion more barrels of oil a day now  than we were 6 or 7 years ago, so we do  have an energy policy—green energy,  moving away from the greenhouse gasses;  a  labor  policy;  education,  the  training  of  our workers;  research,  which is critically important. We may  come to that later today, but I really  want to focus on this one which is at  the bottom because it is foundational.  The foundation of the economy of the  United States is the infrastructure.  Way, way back, the Founding Fathers—everybody around here wants to  talk about the Founding Fathers and  what the Founding Fathers would do  and how they would act. I will tell you  what George Washington did  in his  first weeks in office.  He turned to Alexander Hamilton,  the Treasury Secretary, and said: Hey,  Alex. Develop an economic development plan for me. How are we going to  grow our economy?  Treasury Secretary Hamilton came  back—he formed a committee of one,  and he came back with a plan of,  maybe, 30, 40 pages, and in that plan  was fundamental infrastructure development.  He said the role of the Federal Government is to make sure that we have  postal roads, to make sure that we  have ports and canals—the infrastructure of the day.  So, for those who like to harken back  to the Founding Fathers—they ought  to also consider the mothers. In any  case, infrastructure was fundamental.  Today, I want to talk about infrastructure, and I want to do it in a way that  will really, hopefully, excite this body  into passing a very robust, complete  surface  transportation  infrastructure  bill.  Now, President Obama and Department of Transportation Secretary Foxx  have made a proposal called  ‘‘Build  America.’’ It is a good proposal that  covers all of  the elements  that we  need—the highways, the ports, the railroads, freight. All of those things are  in that bill. Unfortunately, it didn’t  have a hearing last year. Hopefully, it  will be foundational this year as we  consider in the next 3 months a surface  transportation  infrastructure bill  for  the United States because, in May, the  world comes to an end as the programs  of the Federal Government’s for transportation expire. We need a new law  going forward, so what we want to talk  about today is that issue.  I am going to take just a few seconds.  Every now and then, somebody sends  brochures and studies to us. This one  came from Duke University, the Center  on Globalization, Governance & Competitiveness:  ‘‘Infrastructure  Investment Creates American Jobs,’’  and  they have got this little executive summary which is really helpful to us:  Old and broken transportation infrastructure makes the United States less competitive than 15 of our major trading partners  and makes American manufacturers less efficient in getting goods to market.  Representative HAHN, that is where  you want to come in and talk about  ports.  This is Duke University:  The  underinvestment  of  infrastructure  costs the United States over 900,000 jobs, including 97,000 American manufacturing jobs.  Maximizing  American-made  materials  when rebuilding infrastructure has the potential to create even more jobs. Relying on  American-made  inputs  can also mitigate  safety concerns related to large-scale outsourcing.  b1700  One of the things that really, really  bothers me about my home State of  California  is  the way  in which  the  State of California decided to build the  San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. We  are talking about a multibillion-dollar  project,  $3.9 billion over budget,  12  years late, and the steel in that bridge  came from China. How brilliant was  that?  One of the principal reasons for the  delay was the steel was delayed, the  steel was faulty, and the welds were  faulty. There were 3,000 jobs in China  and zero jobs in the United States. By  the way, the Chinese demanded that  they be the inspectors on the job—not  good at all. This kind of tells us about  why making it in America is important.  There  is another example.  I don’t  like to brag about New York, since  that is a long, long way from my district, but the Tappan Zee Bridge  in  New York was built with American  steel, had a $3.9 billion total project  cost,  7,728 American workers were  hired, and it was designed to last 100  years without any major  structural  maintenance.  I know Ms. HAHNis going to come up  here and probably carry on some bragging. We have got a lot to brag about  in California, but we cannot brag about  what happened with the San Francisco-  Oakland Bay Bridge because it was a financial disaster. It was a jobs disaster  for the United States,  for American  workers. Even today, there are continuing reports coming out about the  faulty bridge construction.  Infrastructure  investment  creates  American jobs, and if we require that  those investments be made in America,  we are going to be talking about Americans going back to work. All of us talk  about the middle class. Well, let’s build  the infrastructure, let’s use American-  made materials, and let’s really build  American jobs for the middle class.  Ms. HAHN, I believe you have something to say about ports. The fact is  that you  represent  the  two biggest  ports in America, you will argue: Long  Beach and the Port of Los Angeles.  ",2015

105,House,114,0.223,45,2015-01-27,Mr. REICHERT.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  CATHYMCMORRISRODGERSfor her comments and her support of law enforcement officers and  sheriffs  that  she  works with.  Ten years ago—well, a little longer  ago than that—I was the president of  the Washington State Sheriffs Association, and so I had the opportunity to  work with all of the sheriffs and police  chiefs in Washington State.  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. DENT).  ",2015
106,House,114,0.243,45,2015-01-27,Mr. DENT.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman from Washington State for  yielding to me, and I thank him for his  very distinguished career  in  law enforcement for all of those 30-plus years.  He had a great reputation, served honorably, and was involved in some very  high-profile cases that are,  I think,  worthy of a lot of discussion.  I wanted to take time today to express my strong support for the brave  men and women who serve on our Nation’s Federal, State, and local law enforcement  agencies.  Particularly,  I  would like to honor two New York City  police officers, Officers Ramos and Liu,  who were brutally slain in an ambush  on December 20, targeted simply because they wore the New York Police  Department uniform.  Officer Ramos was a devoted husband  and the father of two young children.  He had just celebrated his 40th birthday. Officer Liu, who married just 3  months ago,  leaves behind his devastated young wife and parents. All  across the Nation, the thoughts and  prayers of grateful citizens go out to  their families, friends, and officers who  served with them.  I  live  in Allentown, Pennsylvania,  not terribly far from New York City. I  have to tell you, I believe the New  York City Police Department is among  the finest big city police departments  anywhere  in the world.  I remember  September 11, 2001, we saw firefighters  and police officers and others  rush  down to the Twin Towers.  We recognized and celebrated their  heroism because many of them gave  that last full measure of devotion on  that day. There was no profession more  noble than being a police officer at  that time, and particularly a New York  City police officer. How times have  changed  in a  fairly short period of  time.  This extraordinary police department  has come under fire because they have  implemented very effective police practices which have been a model for the  rest of the Nation, have kept crime  rates low, and is something we should  be celebrating, that department and  the men and women who work there. It  is a very diverse police department,  among the most diverse anywhere.  I would also like to point out one  other sad tragedy that we dealt with  this year in my own State. It was the  beautiful fall foliage of Pennsylvania’s  Pocono Mountains that was the backdrop of a horror  that many northeastern Pennsylvanians had  to deal  with for several weeks.  We Pennsylvanians recently mourned  our own  loss on September 12, 2014,  when State Police Corporal Bryon  Dickson was murdered under what appear to be similar circumstances to  those  in New York. He was shot to  death because of the badge that he  wore.  Trooper Alex Douglass was seriously  wounded in that same incident. We are  pleased to hear that Trooper Douglass  is recovering steadily, and we wish him  the best in his long road to a full recovery. But what followed that horrific attack and assassination was a truly impressive  7-week manhunt  for  Eric  Frein,  the  shooter and  self-trained,  self-described survivalist.  Over 1,000 officers  from State and  local  law enforcement agencies  from  Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New  York teamed with the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, and ATF, and  it was  amazing. What we witnessed was an  amazing  testament  to  police work,  which ended successfully with the surrender of Frein, and there were no  shots fired. Frein, I should note, is currently standing trial.  Police work is certainly, as Congressman REICHERTknows better than anyone  in this room, and Congressman  NUGENT, too, they know that police  work is inherently dangerous. Officers  must enforce the law in any number of  difficult situations under pressures few  outside the military could possibly understand, from routine traffic stops to  domestic violence situations to hostage cases to murder scenes. America’s  finest must deal with it all. They deserve our support, and they most assuredly have mine.  While we have recently seen a handful of high profile cases of citizens  clashing with police, anyone who has  ever attended a  local  crime watch  meeting knows that police officers care  deeply about  the communities  they  serve. I have attended so many of these  meetings over the years, both as a  State  legislator and even as a Congressman,  numerous  crime  watch  meetings in some pretty tough areas,  and I was always so impressed with the  way the officers immersed themselves  in the daily life of the neighborhoods  for which they were responsible. No  problem was too small. They would  deal with it.  Now is the time for all of us to roll  up our sleeves and work to address the  underlying issues that have animated  enormous  emotions  in  communities  across our country.  I should point out, too, as a new  member of the bipartisan House Law  Enforcement Caucus, I look forward to  working with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to advance Federal  policy that supports all of the brave  men and women who have sworn to  protect and serve.  I thank the gentleman from Washington State for putting on this hour  tonight. We need to spend more time  celebrating the fine men and women  who serve us.  ",2015

114,Senate,114,-0.276,108,2015-01-27,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I rise today  on behalf of our Nation’s veterans to  once again discuss the unjust and outdated policy of failing to give our veterans the full military retirement and  veterans disability compensation benefits that they have earned  in their  service to the Nation. Full payment of  retirement and disability benefits, together known as ‘‘concurrent receipt,’’  is an issue that I have strongly advocated for more than a decade.  In the past, veterans were prevented  from receiving the full pay and benefits  they earned in dedicated service to our  country. The law required that military retirement pay be reduced dollar-  for-dollar by the amount of any disability  compensation  a  veteran  received. I am pleased to say that many  Senators have  joined me  in  fighting  this policy, and we have made some  progress on behalf of our Nation’s veterans  In 2003, Congress passed legislation  that allowed disabled retired veterans  with at least a 50 percent disability  rating to become eligible for full concurrent receipt benefits by 2013. In 2004,  the 10-year phase-in period was eliminated  for veterans with 100 percent  service-related  disability. With  the  phase-in period now complete,  I am  deeply gratified that all those veterans  with over 50 percent disability ratings  are now receiving the full benefits they  earned from their service. These are  significant victories that put hundreds  of thousands of veterans on track to receive both their retirement and disability benefits. However, many more  of our veterans remain unjustly  impacted by the denial of concurrent receipt.  For me, this is a simple matter of  fairness. There is no reason to deny a  veteran who has served their country  honorably the right to the full value of  their retirement pay simply because  their service also resulted  in a disability  that affects  them  each and  every day for the rest of their lives.  Unfortunately,  that  is exactly what  the current law does. This legislation  will bring that indefensible practice to  an end.  This is not a partisan issue. Our Nation has been at war for over a decade,  through both Republican and Democratic administrations, and our service  members  have  performed with  unmatched valor around the world. Our  utmost duty as lawmakers should be to  ensure that the brave men and women  who served in the United States Armed  Forces receive the benefits they have  earned.  So once again, I rise on behalf of our  Nation’s veterans. Today, I introduce  legislation that will eliminate all limitations to concurrent receipt. We must  take action now to support our veterans who have never faltered in their  unwavering service to this grateful Nation. This is the right thing to do.  I hope my Senate colleagues will join  me in supporting this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 271  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

115,,114,0.376,115,2015-01-27,Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to honor the life of a beloved member of the Indianapolis community, Bill Mays.  Sadly he unexpectedly passed away on December 4, 2014, his 69th birthday. Bill was a  businessman, a family man, a leader of the  community, and a philanthropist. He built an  economic dream in his business and used his  fortune to help others. His dedication to the  Hoosier community will  forever be  remembered.  A lifelong Hoosier, Bill was born in Evansville on December 4, 1945. He graduated as  the  number  one male  academically  from  Evansville Central High School, where he was  also a member of the football team. He later  received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry and a Master of Business Administration  from  Indiana University  in Bloomington. He  later went on to receive four Honorary Doctorates from universities and colleges in Indiana.  In 1980, Bill launched Mays Chemical Company, Inc. and grew it into one of the largest  chemical  distribution  companies  in  North  America. During the first year of business he  doubled his $1 million sales objective. From  there his business grew exponentially and it is  now  ranked  the 20th  largest chemical distributor in the United States. He was regarded  as one of the most successful businessmen in  Indiana, not just because of Mays Chemical,  but also because of other ventures he undertook. In addition to starting Mays Chemical, he  also owned The  Indianapolis Recorder.  In  1990 Mays purchased The Recorder, saving  the newspaper. His niece, and a dear friend of  mine, Carolene Mays, became general manager of The Recorder in 1998. Under Bill and  Carolene ’s  leadership The Recorder grew  in  readership, prominence, and credibility. The  Recorder is still in circulation today. Mays also  was the former majority owner of the Hoosier  Radio and Television Properties, which include  WAV-TV53, HOT 96.3 FM, WGGR 106.7 FM  and WIRE.  His business savvy was impressive, but his  dedication to the community set him apart. He  served on a wide variety of for-profit and non-  profit boards and held many chairmanships.  His  list of  community  service honors and  awards is lengthy. Just to name a few, he received the National Society of Black Engineers  Golden Torch Award (2003), Indiana University’s Herman B. Wells Visionaries Award  (2000); Wheeler Boys & Girls Club Man and  Youth Award  (1998); Madame C.J. Walker  Lifetime Achievement Award (1998); was  inducted into the Junior Achievement Central Indiana Business Hall of Fame (1998); and had  the honor of carrying the Olympic flame during  its trip through Indianapolis in 1996.  Mays  is survived by his wife, Dr. Rose  Mays, retired Associate Dean of Community  Affairs at Indiana University’s School of Nursing, daughters Kristin Mays-Corbitt, President  of Mays Chemical, and Heather Mays-Woods,  an educator. Bill was a mentor and a leader  of the business community, but most importantly he was a husband and father. On many  occasions Mays had said that his true passion  was his  family. Please  join me  in  thanking  Bill’s  family and  friends  for sharing such a  wonderful man with the Hoosier community.  f  ENHANCING SERVICES FOR RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS VICTIMS  OF YOUTH TRAFFICKING ACT OF  2015  SPEECHOF  HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 26, 2015  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of  the Judiciary and Homeland  Security Committees, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 468, ‘ ‘Homeless Victims of Youth Trafficking Act of 2015. ’ ’  I support  this bipartisan  legislation which  amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Act  of 2000 by inserting the phrase ‘ ‘sever forms  of trafficking in persons’ ’ and including ‘ ‘youth  who are victims of  trafficking,’ ’  in  the definitions for the law.  Mr. Speaker, trafficking in persons is an inconceivable, callous and inhumane crime that  unquestionably deserves  the nation ’s utmost  attention. It is particularly difficult to see the  victimization of the very young who are sold or  tricked into becoming victims of Human Trafficking.  I join my colleagues is working to strengthen  laws against human trafficking, and supporting  the allocation of resources to further the efforts of law enforcement and aid agencies in  identification of youth victims and provide vital  support to preventing further victimization and  to  reclaim  the  lives of  the most vulnerable  among us—our children from traffickers.

116,House,114,-0.471,6,2015-02-03,Mr. TAKANO.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to show my support for America’s middle class.  Currently, government  rules allow  for only 11 percent of salaried workers  to be eligible for overtime pay. Contrast that to 1975, when the  income  threshold for overtime pay covered 65  percent of our salaried workers. This is  because Department of Labor rules prohibit workers who  earn more  than  $23,660 a year from earning overtime  pay.  Recently, I was joined by more than  30 of my colleagues in calling for this  administration  to  raise  the  income  threshold to $69,000. At this level, we  could cover the same number of workers who were eligible in 1975. For 35  years, American workers  have  increased  their productivity, yet  they  have not been rewarded. Let’s remember that it is a strong middle class that  drives economic growth.  Be bold, Mr. President. Your administration can help middle class families. Raise the  income threshold  for  overtime pay.  f  A COLLEGE EDUCATION FOR ALL  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2015

118,House,114,0.78,20,2015-02-03,Mr. PALMER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 596, a bill that  would fully repeal the Affordable Care  Act offered by Mr. BYRNEof Alabama.  Right  now, Americans  are  being  forced to buy a government product or  pay a penalty. The Constitution mandates  freedom, not  the purchase of  health insurance or any other product.  We all remember this promise:  ‘‘If  you like your health care plan, you can  keep it.’’ In 2013, a reported 4.7 million  people in 32 States lost their health insurance when their plans were canceled. That is just the beginning. The  Congressional Budget Office projects  that 7 million more Americans will  lose their health-sponsored coverage in  2016.  Americans were promised that with  ObamaCare their premiums would be  lower.  Instead, premiums have  skyrocketed. Some groups have seen their  premiums increase by 78 percent. At  the same time, household incomes have  gone down.  Today, 4 years after the passage of  ObamaCare, there are still more than  41 million people without health coverage. There are millions of people out  of full-time work and millions more  forced into part-time jobs.  ObamaCare must be repealed and replaced. Americans should be allowed to  buy the health  insurance they want  and need. We need market competition  between health  insurance  providers,  and people should be able to buy their  health  insurance across State  lines.  This would result in more choices for  plans and at lower costs.  We need portability so that when a  person changes or  loses a  job, they  don’t lose their health insurance. We  need innovative reforms for Medicaid  and reforms that create incentives for  controlling costs, promoting healthier  lifestyle  choices,  and  reforms  that  treat people with dignity.  H.R. 596 starts the process of reforming our health care system by repealing ObamaCare. This is the first step  toward true affordable health care that  puts people back  in charge of their  health care choices.  b1445  ",2015
119,House,114,-0.404,20,2015-02-03,Mr. BUTTERFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in strong opposition to this bill.  This vote today marks the 56th attempt by House Republicans to dismantle the ACA. If enacted, more than  19 million people who were previously  uninsured would lose tax credits and  subsidies that make insurance affordable.  Members who voted for this bill are  telling the American people that access to affordable, quality health care  should be reserved for only those who  have the means to afford it. Let me  just tell you a very brief story about a  man named Carlton Stevens, Jr., from  my hometown of Wilson, North Carolina.  Last year was a very challenging  year for the Stevens family of five as  they found themselves uninsured. As  Mr. Stevens and his wife found themselves between jobs and in a new town,  they prioritized  finding health  coverage for their family.  Mr.  Stevens  visited  the  Federal  Health  Insurance  Marketplace  to  search for coverage and was surprised  and elated to know that he and his  family qualified for a credit of approximately $800. He and his wife were able  to purchase  insurance  for his entire  family for less than $200.  Mr. Speaker, this bill would deprive  families like the Stevens family of affordable health care in a time of need.  I wonder why my Republican friends  are doing this again.  ",2015
120,House,114,0.477,20,2015-02-03,Mr. HILL.," Thank you, Mr. Chairman,  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 596 which repeals the President’s flawed health care law in its entirety and provides the Congress with a  clean slate to implement the real, patient-centered health care reform that  this Nation needs and deserves.  The majority of Americans are opposed to ObamaCare and its harmful  intended  or unintended  side  effects  which have increased costs, decreased  health care access, and lost jobs, work  hours, and wages for many of our hardworking families.  This is an opportunity to recognize  the flaws of mandates and a top-down  approach to health care and allows us  to finally consider ideas that will result in a health care system that empowers and encourages individuals to  take control of and responsibility for  their health care through the use of  tools like health savings accounts and  incentives that reward healthy behaviors.  We need targeted, transparent, well  thought out reforms that acknowledge  the complexity of our health care system, and with the right kind of reforms, we can get the right kind of  health care that is affordable and accessible.  ",2015
121,House,114,-0.439,20,2015-02-03,Ms. CASTOR of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  the Affordable Care Act is a great help  to American families.  Most Americans have health insurance through their employer. The ACA  provides  important consumer protections for those families. They cannot  end your policy if you get sick, your  copayments and premiums have to go  to health services and not to profits for  insurance companies, and kids aged 26  or younger  can  stay on your own  health insurance plan.  For Americans on Medicare, the ACA  is saving you money. In fact, since passage of the ACA, more than 7.9 million  people who  rely  on Medicare have  saved almost $10 billion on prescription  drugs. You have new wellness checkups, and the Affordable Care Act extended the life of the Medicare trust  fund for more than a decade.  Finally, before the ACA, many Americans were barred from health insurance because of a previous diagnosis of  cancer, diabetes, or  something else.  The Affordable Care Act has been a  lifeline for them because it ended discrimination and created new marketplaces for Americans to shop for the  best plan for their families.  In Florida alone, my home State, 1.5  million Floridians have already signed  up for a plan in the marketplace in the  upcoming year. That is 1.5 million Floridians.  Please, colleagues, don’t take this  away. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill.  ",2015
122,House,114,0.518,27,2015-02-03,Mr. BRADY of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Frightened—in the days before this  health care  law was brought to the  floor, Democrats were meeting in the  White House in secret, cutting special  deals, trying to find a way to pass this  bill because they were frightened that  if they did it in the public, out where  the people could see what they were  creating, that they would fail.  The night they brought  it to the  House floor, they were frightened that  the American public would know what  was in it. They brought it to the floor,  and literally no one on this floor knew  what was in this bill. They were frightened about what the American public  would believe.  Since  it has passed,  frankly,  too  many Americans  are  frightened  by  what they have been exposed to, which  is forced into health care plans. They  had good ones in their business, and  now, they are  forced  into ones that  cost more, the deductibles have soared,  and they can’t see their local doctor or  go to their local hospital or even pay  for medicines  for their children because of this health care plan.  Democrats at the time didn’t allow a  vote  on  any  other  alternative—no  ideas, no options—because they were  frightened the American public could  see there is a better way.  The question today, Mr. Speaker, is:  Can we do better? Can we do better  than this law? Yes. It has helped some  but has hurt so many more.  Today is about taking the first step  to allowing a better option for American families, providers, and patients  by  first  repealing  this controversial  and troubling law and then bringing to  the floor—directing our committees to  bring a better idea to the floor so that  the American public has a chance for  real, affordable health care that is directed toward them—not Washington—  that goes with them from job to job  and State to State, home to raise a  family or to start that small business,  one that is tailored to them, not Washington.  Mr. Speaker, this law is about not  top down, but bottom up; and it is long  overdue. I support and strongly urge  repeal of the health care law and passage of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2015
123,House,114,-0.451,27,2015-02-03,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in opposition to H.R.  596.  As the new ranking member on the  Committee  on  Education  and  the  Workforce, I know that protecting access  to  affordable  health  care  for  America’s workers and  families  is a  high priority. Despite scare tactics and  misinformation,  the  bottom  line  is  that the Affordable Care Act is working. Perhaps those who want to repeal  the Affordable Care Act have a short  memory. It is important to remember  why  the Affordable  Care Act was  passed in the first place.  Before the ACA, employer-provided  coverage was shrinking. More and more  employers were dropping coverage altogether. There were months in 2008  and 2009 when 14,000 people a day were  losing their health insurance because  employers were not providing it and  because it was above their ability to  pay. From 1999 to 2010, the cost of premiums  for employer-provided health  insurance  increased  by  138  percent  while workers’ earnings only went up  around 40 percent. And those who were  employed were often locked into their  employment  for  fear of  losing their  health  care  insurance because  even  though  they wanted  to  retire,  they  couldn’t get insurance somewhere else,  and so they were stuck in that job.  Every American family with insurance had to pay a hidden tax of approximately $1,000 per family for the  cost of paying for those without insurance who would go to the hospital and  not pay, and so when they went to the  hospital, they would have to pay a little extra. That little extra was about  $1,000 per year for every family with insurance. This was  the  reality  that  American workers and their families  faced before the passage of the Affordable Care Act. We should not go backwards.  Today, thanks to the ACA, workers  are enjoying the peace of mind that  they have options.  If  employer-provided coverage is not available, they  can enter  the marketplace.  If  it  is  available, they have the security of  new consumer protections such as the  requirement that at least 80 percent of  the  premiums  be  spent  on  actual  health care, not corporate jets and CEO  bonuses. And we ended insurance practices such as caps on payments that  would only pay so much overall and  then you are on your own, or so much  for your lifetime and then you are on  your own. And cancelations where they  could just arbitrarily cancel your insurance after you have paid premiums  year after year. You get sick, and they  check and just want to cancel your premium. Those abuses can no longer take  place.  Employers will also suffer under a repeal. In 2014, premiums for employer-  provided health care grew at the lowest  rate in 15 years. If the ACA is repealed,  many  employers  could  again  be  charged health-related premiums, so if  they have a few sick employees, they  will see their premiums skyrocket. The  vast majority of large employers who  provide health insurance to their employees may suffer an increase in premiums due to the return of the hidden  tax, the cost shifting of uncompensated  care.  And when employees  leave a  job,  they are on their own to get insurance,  if they can, because there was a prohibition that they could deny people with  VerDate Sep 11 2014  02:24 Feb 04, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K03FE7.046 H03FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T Q 7 6 K S D l n o d a n o d c m e         ",2015

128,Senate,114,0.496,69,2015-02-03,Mr. CORNYN.," I will not yield at this  time, Mr. President. I will be glad to  yield at the conclusion of my remarks  if the Senator still has a question.  Then there is the Senator from Montana who said: I would prefer that the  Congress act, yes.  Then there is the Senator from Delaware who said: What I would say to  Congress, I am going to give you a little bit of time in the new Congress, and  I expect you to do something.  So that is eight Members of the minority party who said they are more  than a little uncomfortable about what  the President has done. Yet today the  Members of the minority party have  voted in lockstep to deny a debate, any  opportunity to discuss how to fund the  Department  of Homeland  Security,  how to rein in a reckless President who  has overreached his constitutional authority.  Here are some other provisions that  are actually in the House bill that perhaps some of the Members of the minority are a little bit nervous to talk  about, much less vote on.  The House has offered as part of their  bill a rider which defunds Executive actions treating domestic violence, sexual abuse, and child exploitation offenders as secondary priorities for removal. In other words, the President’s  Executive action took people who have  actually committed crimes—not  just  entered the country illegally but committed other crimes—and made them  nonpriority in terms of removal.  Then, of course, there is the provision of the House bill that says we  don’t want to disadvantage legal immigrants and people who played by the  rules because  the House  recognized  that is exactly what the President’s  Executive action did.  It kicked the  people who played by the rules to the  back of the line and the people who did  not to the front of the line. But our  friends in the minority obviously don’t  want to talk about that either.  Millions of foreign-born immigrants  have  become  successful,  patriotic  American citizens. We are richer as a  country because of the contributions  they have made to our great land.  The fundamental choice we have is,  are we going to have controlled immigration or uncontrolled immigration?  The President and apparently his political party have embraced uncontrolled,  illegal immigration as their cause.  We, on the other hand, have said we  believe  in the benefits to our great  country of legal immigration and assimilation because that is who we are.  All of us have a family story somewhere back in our history. Mine goes  back to the 19th century following a  potato crop  famine  in  Ireland  that  caused my forebears to immigrate to  Canada and then to the United States.  Everybody has a story like that.  But it is a sad and important realization that the President, through his  Executive action, is disrespecting the  very individuals who have played by  the rules and whom we celebrate as  great, patriotic Americans. But apparently our friends in the minority don’t  even want to talk about it, so that is  why they stopped this funding bill—$40  billion  to  fund  the Department  of  Homeland  Security—and  refused  to  even talk about it, much less debate it.  They are going to come out here on the  floor, I trust, and click through the  days and say: Well, we only have 3  weeks until the Department runs out  of money. It is like the old story about  the teenager who murders his own parents, and then he goes to court and  pleads  for mercy  because—he  says:  Judge, I am an orphan. That is what  our friends in the minority have done.  This is a crisis of their own making.  In fact, we don’t want a crisis. We want  to  eliminate  government  by  crises.  That is why the House has passed the  responsible piece of  legislation they  have. That is why we ought to take it  up today. If they don’t like it—I know  there are Members on our side who disagree with certain portions of it—then  we ought to debate it and we ought to  vote. Any way we look at it, the Senate ought to at least have the debate  on this legislation.  Last week our colleague from Illinois,  the assistant minority  leader,  came to the floor and praised the new  majority leader, Senator MCCONNELL,  for his leadership during the first few  weeks of the new Republican majority  here in the Senate. He said:  I hope that in our role in the minority, we  can work with you to achieve at least debate  on the floor if not some significant legislation.  That was a nice moment. But then  the very next day, on a call with reporters, my  colleague  from  Illinois  pledged to filibuster the House-passed  Department  of  Homeland  Security  funding bill and refused to even allow a  debate—a threat they made good on  today.  So my request to our colleagues on  the Democratic side is simple: Honor  the promise the senior Senator from Illinois made last week to have an open  and fair debate and not just shut it  down and create government by crisis  and add to the very dysfunction the  voters repudiated on November 4.

132,,114,-0.41,90,2015-02-03,Mr. CROWLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  pay  tribute  to  the  life and service of Luke  Wagner Adams. Luke was a beloved member  of  the Queens  community, who  recently  passed away at 76 years of age.  A longtime Queens resident, Luke settled in  Sunnyside as a young man and quickly became one of the community’s most well-known  activists. One of Luke ’s enduring legacies was  his  leadership at  the helm of  the Gateway  Restoration Project, which led to the creation  of Sunnyside’s most iconic symbol, the Sunnyside Arch. Luke led the charge on a number  of additional projects to improve Sunnyside as  a prominent member of the Sunnyside Chamber of Commerce, Sunnyside/Woodside Lions  Club, Sunnyside Kiwanis Club, and Sunnyside  Artists. In recognition of his long list of accomplishments, the Sunnyside Chamber of Commerce and Sunnyside Artists’ annual  ‘Luke  Adams Sunnysider of  the Year’ award was  named in his honor.  Luke will forever be known not only for his  love for his community, but also for his generosity and selflessness. Luke ’s loyalty to his  friends and community was unmatched, and  he was willing  to go above and beyond  for  those who asked him for help. Whether it was  raising money for the hungry, being the first to  welcome a newcomer to the neighborhood, or  ensuring  that others who  joined him  in his  civic engagement received proper recognition,  Luke was the most humble and genuine person one could come across.  Luke was immensely proud of his community, and dedicated his  life  to making his  neighborhood a better place. Mr. Speaker,  Luke’s commitment to Queens is, and will continue to be, an inspiration to all of us. I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring the life and  legacy of Luke Wagner Adams. May he rest in  peace.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. STEVE KING  OFIOWA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 3, 2015  ",2015

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  gentleman from Mississippi because it  has been truly a pleasure to try to  work on something where we are not  working  for perfection, but we are  looking to find agreement and to do  the best thing possible that supports  the goals of NASA and all of the space  industry, but also so that we get something done in this Congress.

139,House,114,0.492,20,2015-02-10,Mr. PALAZZO.,"  I also want to thank the chairman of  the full committee, LAMARSMITH, and  our ranking member, EDDIEBERNICE  JOHNSON—both  of  Texas—for  supporting a process that leads us to the  point we are today.  This bipartisan bill that we are considering, the NASA Authorization Act  of 2015, is largely identical to a bill  that passed the House last year, H.R.  4412, and it passed with overwhelming  support by a vote of 401–2. Unfortunately, time ran out during the last  Congress before the Senate was able to  take final action to reauthorize NASA,  and so here we are.  H.R. 810 authorizes appropriations for  1 year, consistent with the funding levels enacted for fiscal year 2015. Other  than relevant date changes, the bill remains unchanged from last year’s bipartisan, House-passed H.R. 4412 and  retains the important and timely policy direction that NASA needs now to  ensure stability and to sustain maximum progress on its programs.  Mr. Speaker, building on the foundation set  in H.R. 810, I and my colleagues on  the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee will be able to  begin work on a multiyear NASA authorization once H.R. 810  is enacted  into law, so we have set the process in  place.  Why is this bipartisan bill important,  and why am I urging my colleagues in  the House to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill  should it come to a vote?  Mr. Speaker, the developments in our  Nation’s  civil  space  program never  cease to amaze us and never cease to  inspire countless individuals not only  in the United States, but across the  globe. NASA, as a multimission agency, makes  these  awe-inspiring  contributions not only in human exploration, but across the disciplines of  space and earth science, in the development of  innovative  technologies,  in  human spaceflight operations and biomedical research, and in aeronautics.  It is this multipronged approach that  we support today.  In  the  sciences, NASA  is making  good progress on developing the James  Webb Space Telescope, the next major  observatory to follow the Hubble Space  Telescope.  b1645  NASA researchers are using data collected from space to identify new planets orbiting stars other than our Sun,  to  increase  our  scientific  understanding of Mars and other planets in  the solar system, to uncover critical  information about our home planet,  Earth, and its climate, and to study  the Sun and space weather. These programs will lead to new discoveries and  deepen our  scientific knowledge.  In  fact, much of NASA’s work also benefits our society in terms of new technologies and applied research that can  improve the quality of life of all of our  citizens.  NASA is taking critical steps now in  building the systems that will eventually take humans, as my colleague has  said,  into deep space. NASA  is also  overseeing recently awarded contracts  to commercial companies that will develop, test, and seek certification for  the U.S.  commercial  space vehicles  VerDate Sep 11 2014  02:30 Feb 11, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10FE7.011 H10FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o r e c n e p S S         ",2015

If Homeland Security funding  lapses on February 27, the agency will be  pushed into a partial shutdown even as the  terrorist threat is at the forefront of public  attention with the Charlie Hebdo and Islamic State murders. Imagine if the Transportation Security Administration, a unit of  DHS,  fails to  intercept an  Islamic State  agent en route to Detroit?  Well,  the Wall Street Journal  is  right. These are dangerous times. Our  Nation  is on high alert  for  terror  threats after the attacks in Paris and  Ottawa and Sydney that have shocked  the world in recent months. We don’t  have  the  luxury of playing politics  with Homeland Security funding. We  are trying to keep pace with threats  that can occur at any time, anywhere,  with little or no warning. We have to  be prepared.  It is not just security grant programs  for State and  local  first  responders  that would get shortchanged if we fail  to pass a full-year bill. Border security,  maritime security, and nuclear detection activities would be underfunded as  well.

Mr.  Speaker, I rise today on the conclusion of National School Counseling Week to honor a deserving  school  counselor  in my  district.  Vanessa Iaquinta joined Norwalk High School  in 1998, and  is  the heart and soul of  the  school’s counseling  team. She has made a  tremendous  impact on  the  lives of Norwalk  students because she believes that every one  of them should be given the tools necessary  to succeed in both college and life.  Ms.  Iaquinta works with parents  to make  sure  they  feel  included and  informed about  their child ’s education. Vanessa and her team  have developed a personalized and  comprehensive  approach  that meets  the  academic, social-emotional, and post-secondary  needs of each and every Norwalk High School  student. She goes above and beyond, even  using social media  to stay connected with  graduates,  reminding  them  of  application  deadlines for student aid and scholarships.  Vanessa is also the counselor for AVID, a  program that helps students who have shown  the potential to succeed but need a little extra  help. She meets with students, and coordinates with teachers to make sure their individual needs are being met.  This year, Vanessa agreed to be the counselor for the newly established Project Lead  the Way which exposes students to the field of  biomedicine.  In  the  few short months since  Vanessa has undertaken  this  role,  the program has expanded,  interest has  increased,  and students are thriving.  Norwalk High School is a special place because  of  dedicated  professionals  like  Vanessa. In honor of National School Counselors Week, I ask my colleagues to join me  in thanking all the school counselors who are  making a positive impact in the lives of our  students.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

As an African American woman born in the  1917, Ms. Horne, who passed away in 2010,  was truly a woman of firsts, having pioneered  the way for many men and women of color  through her work in Jazz, film, and the Civil  Rights movement. She began her career  in  the chorus line at Harlem’s famed Cotton Club  before moving on to record dozens of musical  tracks and playing roles in movies and musicals.  As a young woman, Lena drew much fame  from her beauty and talent, yet found many  roadblocks in her personal success due to the  hyper-racialized nature of show business at  the  time. However,  this adversity would not  limit her, and presented a platform for her increasing support of and action  in  the Civil  Rights movement.

Edna was a  valued  member of my Capitol Hill staff during the late  1990’s, and she lived in San Francisco during  the past decade. She would have turned 42  years old today. I say ‘ ‘would have ’ ’ because,  sadly, Edna passed away unexpectedly on  June 8, 2014.  One of Edna’s great passions was participating in the annual AIDS/LifeCycle, a 7 day,  545 mile bike ride from San Francisco to Los  Angeles to raise funds and awareness in the  fight against HIV/AIDS. Edna was a veteran  rider  and  participated  in  her  13th AIDS/  LifeCycle last year. Her involvement originally  stemmed from a strong desire to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS  in  the Filipino American  community. She oftentimes rode in the memory of  friends whom she had met over  the  years.  Edna took part in last year’s event with her  husband, Richard Lagunte, also a  longtime  rider. Sadly, she suffered cardiac arrest in the  middle of  the ride and passed away shortly  thereafter.  Not only was she well-known among event  organizers and fellow cyclists, she was a beloved individual. Edna was genuine, enthusiastic,  compassionate, and  full of  life. Her  strong dedication to serving the needs of individuals with HIV/AIDS and raising awareness  was truly outstanding and serves as an example for all of us.  During her tenure in my office, Edna was a  respected member of my staff who gave so  much of herself. I will always remember her  for her cheerful spirit, generosity, positive attitude, and her stunning smile.  Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues and  this House  to rise with me  to celebrate  the  birth and  life of Edna Flores-Lagunte.  I am  saddened that after less than 42 years of living, we must say  farewell  to a  remarkable  human being who personified the very best in  public service.  I extend my deepest condolences  to Edna’s husband Richard, parents  Nena and Esposito Flores, and brother Edward. She  touched so many and  is deeply  missed.  f  TRIBUTE TO TUCKER BLUML  HON.

147,,114,0.338,97,2015-02-10,Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to recognize my friend, Dr. William  A. Meehan, who has gone above and beyond  in his service to my alma mater, Jacksonville  State University. Dr. Meehan is retiring from  his post as the president of JSU on June 30th,  2015, where his leadership and support will be  sorely missed.  Dr. Meehan first enrolled at JSU as a freshman  in  1968,  completed  his Bachelor  of  Science in biology in 1972 and in the same  year began a career in education. In 1976, he  earned his Master’s of Science degree in biology at Jacksonville State University and  the  following year returned as an instructor in the  Department of Biology. He received a Doctorate of Education in the field of higher education administration  from  the University of  Alabama.  Among  the positions Dr. Meehan held at  JSU prior to becoming president were: Coordinator of Medical Technology Program, Director  of Academic Advisement, Assistant Vice President  for Academic Affairs, Associate Vice  President  for Academic and Student Affairs,  Acting Vice President  for Academic Affairs,  and Acting Vice President for Institutional Advancement. He assumed the position of president on July 1st, 1999.  Dr. Meehan’s expansive vision for JSU included looking to the future while drawing on  the strengths of the past. One of his primary  goals has been to extend classrooms and remove barriers  to a college degree. Through  the use of Internet, the University is able to  make classes and learning more accessible to  those who work, or for other reasons may not  be able to reside on or near the main campus.  Under Meehan’s leadership, JSU is working to  move forward to allow education to be an opportunity  to  those who were previously excluded.  President Meehan has strived  to ensure  JSU’s bright future; through partnerships with  K–12 and community colleges, he has turned  JSU into a campus in which education can be  seen as a seamless process flowing from kindergarten through graduate school.  While overseeing  the development of  the  University’s  first strategic plan, Dr. Meehan  said that JSU more accurately accomplished  the institution’s mission through integrating traditional academic programs with career-oriented programs for students. His initiative for  the future was founded upon the principle that  education spurs economic development.  Dr. Meehan  is also highly  involved  in  the  community. He has served as an executive  committee member of the Board of Directors  of the United Way of East Central Alabama,  and is active in the area Chambers of Commerce of both Calhoun and Etowah Counties.  Meehan  is married  to  the  former Elizabeth  Stevens, and  father  to  twin boys Drew and  Will, and daughter Carol Grace. President  Meehan  is a devoted member of  the First  Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Alabama.  On April 3rd, 2015, there will be a community-wide event to honor Dr. Meehan and his  family.  Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Dr.  William Meehan for his tireless dedication to  Jacksonville State University and  the  surrounding community. His exemplary service in  education is an inspiration. We wish him the  best of luck in his future endeavors.  f  A  TRIBUTE  TO  LT.

148,House,114,0.258,11,2015-02-26,Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker,  this morning, Connecticut  Senator CHRISMURPHYand I outlined a  vision for real bipartisan mental health  reform. Our legislation will have some  differences but also many similarities.  Both will  fix the shortage of psychiatric beds; get more mental health  workers,  such as psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers to help;  integrate physical and mental health  care; fix the rule which says severely  mentally ill patients on Medicaid can’t  see two doctors on the same day; and  better coordinate the staggering 112  Federal agencies that deal with severe  mental illness.  My bill, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, will also allow  treatment before tragedy. During the  trial of the former marine who killed  Iraq war veteran Chris Kyle, the mother of the defendant begged VA doctors  to keep her son in psychiatric treatment  just days before he  shot and  killed the decorated sharpshooter.  The reality is the system doesn’t respond until after a crisis has occurred,  because the only way to get treatment  is if the individual is imminently homicidal or suicidal.  We have to fix those problems. We  must correct HIPAA so families can  help their loved ones get well. We must  act now before another 40,000 die by  suicide, before thousands more end up  in jail, homeless, or victims of crime,  and before more families suffer.  I invite Democrats and Republicans  to join me as I reintroduce the Helping  Families in Mental Health Crisis Act.  f  DHS SHUTDOWN  (Mr. HIMES asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

And just yesterday,  in  a  hearing  entitled  ‘‘Worldwide  Threats,’’ I sat with the Chiefs of our  Intelligence Services  to  learn about  those worldwide threats. The meeting  was classified, but the summary is this:  there are people out there who would  count it a smashing success to reap  death and destruction on the homeland.  Yet my Republican friends have engineered a situation where, in 2 days, the  Department of Homeland Security will  shut down. It is not because they don’t  have an alternative to get in the way  of the President’s immigration initiative. A judge in Texas ruled with them.  Now, I think that judge is going to be  overturned, but a  judge  ruled with  them. Yet they are going to shut down  the Department of Homeland Security.  I don’t understand that, but I have  got two questions:  If we shut down DHS and, heaven forbid, there is a natural disaster that destroys a community in Oklahoma or  Connecticut, what are we—what are  you going to tell the American people?  If, heaven forbid, one of those people  who wishes this Nation ill succeeds and  the Department of Homeland Security  is shut down, what will we—what will  you tell the American people?  f  A TRIBUTE TO CAMILLE JAYNE  AND COMMUNITY HOUSE  (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)

In the shadows of the Statue of  Liberty, Jersey City is the second largest city  in New Jersey and was recently named the country’s most diverse city.  Jersey City’s history as a city of immigrants has contributed to its current  economic boom. In the late 19th and  early 20th century, an influx of immigrants from Europe flocked to Jersey  City to achieve the American Dream.  Increasingly,  immigrants  have  now  been arriving  from South America,  Asia, Africa, and the Middle East seeking  the  same American Dream and  finding it in Jersey City.  Immigrants to the city have  long  contributed to the economy by opening  small businesses and joining the job  market. Just in the past year, Jersey  City has seen an upgrade in its credit  rating, a continued decline in unemployment, and an ever-increasing skyline. As further proof of Jersey City’s  diversity, over half of the residents  speak a language other than English at  home, and the city council  is comprised with a wide array of individuals  from different ethnic backgrounds.  Jersey City is a true American melting pot, and I applaud Mayor Steve  Fulop and the residents of Jersey City  on its continued progress.  f  ALYSSA FERGUSON’S WELL  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

155,House,114,-0.424,88,2015-02-26,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  today to offer an amendment rooted in  values that I know we all share. While  we may disagree over various aspects  of Federal policy  in K–12 education,  there are  important areas where we  can in fact find common ground.  We all believe that our children deserve an education that prepares him  or her to succeed in a modern economy.  We all know that far too many children  don’t get that chance today—particularly children in minority and high-  poverty schools. We all know that over  the next 10 years, jobs in STEM fields—  science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics—are expected to grow at  almost twice the rate of jobs in other  fields.  Today, in Massachusetts, Mr. Chairman, the unemployment rate for Hispanic residents  is 60 percent higher  than for their White neighbors, and it  is over 110 percent higher for African  Americans. Even more alarming, the  poverty rate for Black families in Massachusetts is 144 percent higher than  their White neighbors and 273 percent  higher for Hispanics. Shockingly, those  numbers are actually better than far  more States across the country.  While our economy is steadily improving, that gap is a dangerous economic  undercurrent  that,  left  unaddressed, will affect us all. In an increasing  globalized  and  competitive  economy, we need to ensure that we  are tapping all the talent and potential  that we have here in America in order  to succeed.  Title I funds are some of the best resources the Federal Government has to  make sure that every child in every  school has a fair chance at the starting  line, delivering much-needed assistance  to  schools  that  disproportionately  serve minority and  low-income communities. But this bill, in its current  form, would jeopardize the already inthat  so many  adequate  resources  schools depend on.  The Democratic substitute is a better  path. It would protect those title I resources and allow them to serve their  original civil rights purpose: to ensure  that each of our students has an equal  chance to succeed.  I join my Democratic colleagues in  wishing that we were not considering a  bill today that would consolidate title  I funds and undermine their historic  role. But the amendment I offer today  says that even if we are going to be living in the proposed world of cuts and  block grants, STEM education and economic  justice are still priorities we  must elevate.  My amendment would simply allow  but not require States to use their  flexible title I funding for grants that  support the success of women, minorities,  and  low-income  students  in  STEM.  Too often, Mr. Speaker, the resources  our teachers need to prepare their students for jobs today and tomorrow are  limited by ZIP Code, gender, and race.  That makes this far more than an economic issue. It is a civil rights issue  that will define our society for generations to come.  I know that we all support equal access to the jobs of a modern economy.  That is why we must pass this amendment, increase the reach of STEM education into communities that need it  most, and ensure that a student’s potential isn’t limited by the street that  he or she grows up on.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.  ",2015

157,House,114,-0.31,88,2015-02-26,Ms. ESTY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  today in support of this commonsense  amendment, and I want to thank my  good friend, Congressman KENNEDY, for  his leadership on this issue.  This amendment supports equal opportunities  for all of our  children.  Many of the good-paying jobs of the future will require STEM skills, and we  as a country must do better to ensure  that all children, no matter who they  are or where they live, receive quality  math and science education.  For far too long, efforts to expand  STEM education have  left girls and  children of color behind. As wages remain flat and income inequality only  deepens across our country, ensuring  access to quality STEM education for  every child is not just a moral imperative, it is an economic necessity. Our  children deserve  these opportunities  and our companies need vibrant diversity in their workforce.  So, again, I want to thank Congressfor  offering  today’s  amendment, and I urge my colleagues  to support it.  ",2015
158,House,114,0.624,95,2015-02-26,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support  to  my  friend,  Mr.  LOU  BARLETTA’s amendment to the Student  Success Act.  Last week, I had the opportunity to  spend time  in our district and visit  many of our local schools. One thing  that I heard from both administrators  and teachers are the success of afterschool programs and the summer programs. Let’s face it, sometimes, students just have a difficult time maybe  during the school year, and they get  behind, and when they get behind, they  tend to stay behind.  These afterschool programs and these  summer programs give our students  the opportunity to catch up. That is  important because, as long as they are  with and remain with the class and can  be successful, they are successful students.  That is why I am proud to support  Mr. BARLETTA’s amendment providing  that school districts report afterschool,  before school, or summer activities in  their local education plans.  ",2015

162,House,114,-0.478,123,2015-02-26,Ms. WILSON of Florida.," Mr. Chairman, my amendment to H.R. 5 is simple. It will provide students with the  necessary  resources  to  remain  in  school and graduate.  I have witnessed young people who  are mentored through quality in-school  mentoring  programs make  positive  choices,  discover  personal  strength,  and achieve their potential both inside  and outside of the classroom.  According to the National Mentoring  Partnership, youth who have a meaningful relationship with an adult are  five times more  likely to graduate.  Studies also show that these youth are  46 percent less likely than their peers  to start using illegal drugs, 27 percent  less likely to start drinking, 52 percent  less likely to skip a day of school, and  37 percent less likely to skip a class.  Young people who were at risk for  not completing high school but who  had a mentor were 55 percent more  likely to be enrolled in college, 81 percent more  likely  to  report participating regularly  in sports or extracurricular activities, more than twice  as likely to say they held a leadership  position in a club or sports team, and  78 percent more  likely to volunteer  regularly in their communities.  Simply put, mentoring is a proven  cost-effective investment. In fact, for  every $1 invested in mentoring, there is  a $3 return to society.  That is why it is important that we  encourage States to establish and support effective dropout prevention and  reentry programs that will provide necessary assistance to ensure that all of  our children graduate.  My  amendment will  provide  for  school dropout prevention and reentry  by establishing a mechanism to collect  systemic data on dropout reentry and  graduation rates, while establishing a  national clearing house to collect information on effective dropout prevention and reentry programs.  My  amendment will  also  provide  technical assistance to State and local  educational agencies,  carry out national recognition programs for State  and  local educational agencies  that  raise academic achievement levels, and  provide grants  to  local  schools and  agencies with dropout rates above the  State’s average to implement effective  and sustainable dropout prevention and  reentry programs.  That is why I support wholeheartedly  the amendment to H.R. 5. I urge a  ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2015

165,House,114,-0.276,130,2015-02-26,Mr. LOEBSACK.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  I think that there is universal agreement among us in this body that No  Child Left Behind,  the most  recent  iteration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, needs to be replaced.  I think a lot of folks have the same  kinds of concerns I have about the Student Success Act, many of the provisions in that act. One of my major concerns—and, again, I think a number of  us in this body can share these concerns—is that the bill lacks focus on or  support for rural school districts. That  is a big issue.  I was raised  in  Iowa by a single  mother, and I represented rural parts  of Iowa for the last 8 years that I have  been in Congress. I served for 8 years  on the Education and the Workforce  Committee.  I would be  remiss  if  I  didn’t say that I miss my time there  from time to time, although I am enjoying my time on a new committee.  But this issue is something that I  think gets overlooked. I think that a  lot of folks in this body really, through  no  fault of their own and certainly  through no malice on their part, simply don’t recognize or understand the  needs of rural parts of our country, not  just in Iowa, but around the country,  and certainly the needs of rural students.  I find myself as a former educator  often educating my colleagues to some  extent because they don’t seem to understand  sometimes—folks  on  both  sides of the aisle, Mr. Chairman—that  poverty is not just an urban problem.  It is a rural problem as well, and it  does exist in rural areas.  I don’t think we should deny the fact  that fewer students from rural areas  complete  college  than  their  urban  counterparts as well. In fact, this gap  is growing wider by the year.  Again, these are issues that, if we  think just a little bit, we understand  exist out there in our society. And a  large part of the problem is that rural  students  face unique challenges and  barriers to access to resources. For example, many rural students may not  have a proper Internet connection, if  any at all, let alone enough bandwidth  or a computer at home. So it is even  more important that they are exposed  to technology in school.  We know about technology and how  powerful it is in vastly expanding the  educational options and opportunities  available to students  in rural areas,  VerDate Sep 11 2014  08:35 Feb 27, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00130 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A26FE7.077 H26FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o r e c n e p S S         ",2015

181,Senate,114,-0.53,228,2015-02-26,Ms. BALDWIN.," Mr. President,  as  President Obama has noted in his State  of the Union, the American economy is  growing again. We are creating jobs at  the fastest pace since 1999, and unemployment is lower than before the financial crisis. American businesses are  posting large profits and boosting the  stock market along with them.  Yet  for many working Americans,  this good news  is only that, news—  something they see in the paper or on  TV, not in their paychecks or at the  kitchen table. Many of the Wisconsin  workers  I hear  from every day are  struggling to make ends meet. They  are working more, taking home less,  and worried that for the first time in  American history their kids will have  fewer opportunities than they did.  For the last 5 years the Obama administration has been negotiating with  11 nations in the Asia-Pacific region on  a free-trade agreement known as the  Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Some  of  these countries have values similar to  ours and some do not. I fear this agreement could allow some nations to take  advantage of the values we as Americans place on our environment, on  labor laws, on human rights, and on  free  enterprise  rules. These nations  would be competing against American  workers on an uneven playing  field.  This unfair game would continue the  downward pressure on wages that has  plagued American workers since before  NAFTA.  The interests of Wisconsin workers  are being represented in these negotiations by unelected officials in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. I  am here to let these negotiators know  that Wisconsinites don’t want more of  the same  failed promises  from  free-  trade deals.  Wisconsin workers make things. We  have been one of the top manufacturing States  for generations.  If we  hope to continue making things, we  think we should continue to have our  own government as a customer. That is  why I have been a big and strong supporter of  ‘‘Buy American’’ provisions  that require Federal agencies that use  taxpayer dollars to purchase American-  made products.  Free-trade agreements have historically allowed foreign nations too much  leeway when bidding for our government projects and contracts, while not  affording American  companies  that  fair access, that same access. I have  asked the GAO to study this and report  back to Congress so we can know the  effect skirting  ‘‘Buy American’’ laws  have and the cost it has to American  manufacturers.  Currencies  that  reflect  their  true  value are also vital to the conduct of  global trade. When  foreign countries  cheat by manipulating their currencies  to price their goods cheaper, Wisconsin  workers—in  fact all American workers—lose.  Seven  years  ago,  then-Senator  Obama, speaking about the Bush administration’s  inaction  on  currency  manipulation said it best:  Refusing to acknowledge this problem will  not make it go away. . . . The Administration’s refusal to take strong action against  China’s  currency manipulation will  also  make it more difficult to obtain congressional approval for renewed Trade Promotion  Authority, as well as additional trade agreements.  That statement is as true today with  the Obama administration as  it was  with  the Bush administration. Currency  manipulation  is  essentially  cheating. That is why I support including strong and enforceable currency  manipulation provisions in any trade  agreement. Without  these  rules, we  will allow countries to engage in a race  to the bottom that leaves everybody  worse off.  One of  the  things  that has made  America great is our entrepreneurial  spirit. This spirit has attracted immigrant entrepreneurs from all over the  world, but all too often I hear from  Wisconsin businesses whose patented  ideas are being stolen and replicated in  Asia.  I believe any agreement must include  high standards for protecting intellectual property to encourage risk-taking  investments that turn into profitable  companies  and  jobs  in  the United  States. In the same way, I believe our  ideas should be protected, I also believe  that what we call our foods should be  protected from foreign interference.  Let me explain what I mean by that.  In fact, the European Union has sought  to restrict the use of cheese, meat, and  alcohol  names  that American  producers have used for generations. For  instance,  cheese  producers  in Wisconsin would not able to call their  cheese ‘‘feta’’ because it is not made in  Greece, while a brewer  in Wisconsin  couldn’t label his dark beer a ‘‘Bavarian Black’’ because it isn’t made in Bavaria, in Germany.  I have worked hard to urge the U.S.  Trade Representative to reject any attempt by the European Union or any  foreign nation to restrict the use of  common food names in order to protect  our food manufacturers and processors  across this country—and especially as  Wisconsin is a major producer of beer  and brats and cheese, this is an issue  that is very close to home.  Finally, I have concerns about the  value systems of some of the nations  that are party to the TPP. By way of  example, Brunei recently adopted new  sharia laws that include death by stoning  for  acts  of  adultery, homosexuality,  and  forced  amputations  for  other offenses, including consuming alcohol. These laws go so far as to outlaw  VerDate Sep 11 2014  02:13 Feb 27, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G26FE6.043 S26FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w D O R P 1 N V T Q 7 6 K S D l n o d a n o d c m e         ",2015

She  remembers  gramophones, Model-T Fords, washboards,  the first planes and the first radios. At the end  of WWI, Brunette watched celebrations of the  armistice with  her  twin Blondie. Brunette  began teaching school in her early 20s. She  taught during the year and attended summer  school until she finished her degree from the  University of Alabama in 1937. A short time  later, Brunette married W.C. Nelms. Once  WWII began, the majority of Brunette’s family,  including Nelms, served in the Armed Forces.  As noted on one of his medals, ‘ ‘Major W.C.  Nelms’ invaluable service and diligent devotion  to duty  reflect great credit  to him and  the  Armed Forces of the United States. ’ ’ The war  ended and Brunette and Nelms had two children. Brunette continued to teach elementary  school for 14 more years and retired in 1974.  She enjoyed 20 years of retirement with her  dear husband and  family  in Clinton, Mississippi until his passing.  In 2005, Brunette  moved to the great state of Tennessee, where  she now resides in Memphis with family.  As we celebrate Brunette’s 105th birthday,  we celebrate her faith, her health and the innumerable  lives  touched by her  thoughtful  teaching, optimism and friendship. I rise today  to honor Brunette Nelms and ask my colleagues to join with me in thanking her for her  105 years of patriotic contribution and service.  DRINKING WATER PROTECTION  ACT  SPEECHOF  HON. CANDICE S. MILLER  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 24, 2015  ",2015
186,,114,0.343,270,2015-02-26,Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today in support of H.R. 212, the Drinking  Water Protection Act.  Last summer, as a  result of  toxic algae  blooms in Lake Erie, hundreds of thousands of  residents in Toledo were banned from using  the city’s drinking water, creating a state of  emergency  for  local counties. This  incident,  which lasted for multiple days, is a reminder of  the serious threat these toxic blooms pose to  all of our Great Lakes and the communities  that rely on them, and not just the immediately  surrounding communities.  The Great Lakes account for over 20 percent of the fresh water drinking supply on the  entire planet, and they generate billions of dollars each year through the fishing and shipping industries and recreational activities. We  cannot ignore the threat posed by these toxic  algae blooms and need to do more to protect  our magnificent Lakes.  Assuring that we have adequate resources  dedicated  to monitoring and managing  this  threat across the entire Great Lakes Region  must be a priority, which is why I introduced  legislation last Congress to help advance voluntary assurance programs  in Michigan and  why I have and will continue to support legislative measures  like H.R. 212,  the Drinking  Water Protection Act.  Michigan  farmers have been  leading  the  way when  it comes  to protecting our Lakes  from damage caused by algae blooms, but  they should not carry the burden alone. We  must all work together to preserve and protect  the health of our agricultural and maritime resources. It is my hope that this important legislation will be promptly approved by the Senate and sent to the President’s desk.  f  IN  RECOGNITION  OF  MR.

188,Senate,114,-0.194,41,2015-03-10,Mr. NELSON.," Mr. President,  the  House  of  Representatives  recently  passed H.R. 749, the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015.  I am pleased to see the House take  bipartisan action on this bill. Intercity  passenger rail is a critical part of our  transportation  infrastructure. People  in many regions of the country are in  desperate need of better ways to travel  between fast-growing cities, and passenger rail is our best hope at relieving  congestion on highways and runways  that don’t have additional room to expand.  The House bill is a good step forward.  H.R. 749 would maintain current levels  of Federal support for Amtrak to operate routes that connect the country. It  would also authorize some additional  funding  to  invest  in passenger  rail  projects and improve a Federal loan  program that can be used for rail infrastructure. This is a productive place to  start.  The authorization levels in this bill  are too low to get our passenger rail  network where it needs to be, let alone  to keep up with the rest of the world by  bringing high-speed rail to the United  States. H.R. 749 also fails to address  critical rail safety priorities or even  reauthorize  funding  for  the Federal  Railroad Administration’s safety oversight activities.  We can and must do better than a  flat-funded  authorization  bill  that  turns a blind eye to safety and to the  growing needs of our country. I look  forward to working with my colleagues  in the Senate to improve this bill and  make some real progress toward developing modern, safe, and efficient passenger rail options that America deserves.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  ∑",2015
189,Senate,114,0.43,41,2015-03-10,Mr. BLUNT.," Mr. President, I wish  today to honor Bob Hufford, an icon in  the Missouri food industry for the past  63 years. He announced his retirement  from the Associated Wholesale Grocers,  AWG, board of directors after four decades of service with the last 11 years  having served as its chairman. AWG is  a  retailer-owned cooperative  serving  over 2,300 retail member stores with a  complete assortment of grocery, fresh  meat,  fresh produce, specialty  foods,  health care, and general merchandise  items.  During Bob’s  tenure as chairman,  AWG sales grew from $4.5 billion in 2004  to almost $9 billion in 2014, while patronage paid to members grew by 155  percent. Bob helped direct the addition  of the Fort Worth division in 2007, the  replacement of the Oklahoma City distribution center in the same year, and  the addition of the gulf coast division  in 2013. During the same period, Bob  grew his  own  company, Town  and  Country, in Fredericktown, MO, to be  one of the largest employers in southeast Missouri with over 10,000 employees.  Bob’s passion for the food business  was sparked early in his life by his father’s work  for a meatpacking company. Bob’s first job was working in a  local supermarket, while going through  high school and later college. He became a sales representative for the National  Biscuit  Company,  otherwise  known as Nabisco, in 1958. While working for Nabisco, Bob called on two grocers, Max Penner and Wayne Gott, who  recognized his  leadership  skills and  work ethic. In 1970 they invited him to  become a third partner in a new 5,000-  square-foot  store  in Fredericktown,  which Bob accepted.  From  that modest  beginning Bob  grew his business to 44 stores currently  operating. Recently, Bob converted his  company into an employee-owned company, allowing his employees to share  in the store’s profits. Today Bob serves  as the CEO of the company, which operates stores  in Missouri, Arkansas,  Tennessee, and Kentucky. He and his  wife Marsha have a wonderful family of  five children, eight grandchildren, and  two great-grandchildren. Many of his  family members have worked  in the  business next to Bob.

190,House,114,0.298,2,2015-03-17,Mr. REED.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to talk about an impending crisis that  is going to be coming upon us in 2016.  Mr. Speaker, not  too many people  know or realize that our Social Security disability trust fund is going to be  insolvent,  bankrupt,  underfunded—  whatever term you want to use—by the  middle of 2016. Mr. Speaker, what that  means is that our fellow Americans—  approximately 11 million of them—who  receive  Social  Security  disability  checks are going to be looking at a 20  percent reduction in their benefit come  the middle of 2016 if we do not step up  to the plate and reform this critical  program.  Now, Mr. Speaker,  I serve on the  Ways and Means Committee here  in  Washington, D.C., and 2 years ago, I  questioned  our  Treasury  Secretary  from the White House. I said: Mr. Lew,  where is the White House’s proposal to  deal with this issue? Nothing in the  budget from the White House, nothing  in the Treasury Secretary’s testimony  addressed this canary in the coal mine  that is coming down upon us in 2016.  This year I asked the same question,  and essentially what I got was the proposal that they are going to take from  Social Security retirees the contributions they make to Social Security retirement and transfer them into the  disability trust fund.  Mr. Speaker, in my private practice,  my private life as a businessman before  I came to Washington, D.C., that was  essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul.  That is not acceptable.  We need to protect Social Security  retirees. We also, Mr. Speaker, need to  protect our fellow Americans who suffer from disabilities. We need to do better than robbing Peter to pay Paul.  That is why I am looking for input  from colleagues on the other side of the  aisle, for people across the Nation to  say, How can we reform the Social Security disability trust fund so that it  meets  its obligations and  it  stands  with the disabled community in a way  that says, You know what? If you want  to return to work, you can.  Because right now, Mr. Speaker, in  my humble opinion, the Social Security  disability  trust  fund  penalizes  those who suffer  from disabilities  if  they return to work because then they  lose their benefit. That doesn’t make  sense.  I support the work ethic of America,  and that is why I support reforms that  are going to take care of the disability  trust fund, that make sure that our fellow Americans  receive  the  benefits  that they need and rely upon. But we  are also going to stand with our disability community and make sure if  they want to return to work and have  a capacity to return to work, we in  Washington, D.C., will stand with them  and reward that work ethic.  Bottom line: I am going to protect  our Social Security retirees because to  put them in further harm’s way, as we  know the  impending Social Security  crisis that is going to come to a head  in 2033, just around the corner, will  do—to take from that retirement fund  is further weakening our Social Security system. We can do better. We must  do better.  I care about those retirees. I care  about those disabled fellow Americans.  That is why I say today that we are not  going to maintain the status quo of  robbing Peter to pay Paul, but we are  actually going to get to the business of  reform. We are going to protect retirees and take care of our fellow Americans who are disabled.  f  RECESS  ",2015

192,House,114,-0.53,9,2015-03-17,Ms. MOORE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  Mr. HASTINGSfor yielding to me.  I, too, rise in support of H.R. 1031, the  Promoting U.S. Jobs Through Exports  Act of 2014, which reauthorizes the Export-Import Bank long term. I am so  proud to have been able to introduce  this legislation, along with our ranking  member of the Committee on Financial  Services, Ms. WATERS, and Representatives HECKand HOYER.  The bill has 189 Democratic cosponsors. You add that number to the 57 Republicans that are supportive of Representative FINCHER’s legislation to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank and  just do the math there: 189 and 57, far  and above any kind of majority needed  to reauthorize this important jobs creation, jobs engine, and I would hope  that this body would move forward on  reauthorizing this legislation.  My district of Milwaukee, Wisconsin,  has a very strong manufacturing and  industrial base. I believe that we are  maybe second in the country that really depends on a strong manufacturing  and industrial base for our basic economic activity, and the small manufacturers in Milwaukee utilize the Export-  Import Bank to export goods and services to places like China and India.  One of the narratives, the untrue  narratives  about  the Export-Import  Bank is that it is a utility for big companies like Boeing, it is the Bank of  Boeing. Well, not so much. There is an  endless supply chain, like the ones that  I have visited recently.  I just recently went to a shop in Milwaukee that employs 30 people—30 people—yet  they  export U.S. goods  to  work on the Panama Canal.  b1300  The president of that company just  flat out stated that he doesn’t exist  without  the  Export-Import  Bank.  Folks, it is just that simple.  I have heard many debates and arguments about the importance of passing  stuff like Keystone, which is debatable  as a job creator, and where it does create  jobs,  it  is  in a very small geographic area—whereas the Export-Import Bank creates hundreds of thousands of jobs in all of our districts.  Folks, it is just really that simple.  The Export-Import Bank is a necessary  part of our discussion about creating  jobs.  Until we get past the political arguments that are being made about hanging the Export-Import Bank out there  as  low-hanging  fruit to demonstrate  our willingness to cut off so-called corporate welfare so that we can then get  at cutting off entitlement programs to  people, until we get past that cynical  debate, I don’t think that we are going  to see very much in the way of improving our job creation performance in the  United States.

197,,114,-0.487,30,2015-03-17,Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, right now, millions of American women and girls are online, navigating their personal and professional  lives. Sadly, many will be threatened  online or will be subjected to terrifying  harassment.  Journalists,  academics,  and  other  professionals who dare to express an  opinion, especially a feminist one, are  routinely  attacked  with  graphic  threats of rape and murder. Women are  targeted with sexually explicit messages and threats 27 times more than  men, and for women of color and LGBT  women, the rate is even higher. As a  result, young women are deciding not  to pursue certain jobs in order to avoid  the crosshairs of men who think they  don’t belong. Others are being driven  offline, sacrificing their freedom of expression for personal safety.  A decade ago, Congress made online  threats of death or serious injury illegal, but these cases are rarely prosecuted. That is why I am asking my  colleagues to join me in calling on the  Department of Justice to intensify the  investigation and prosecution of the  most extreme cases of online threats.  Ensuring the stronger enforcement of  laws that protect women from violent  online  threats  is  one  commonsense  thing Congress can do to ensure that  the Internet and the 21st century economy is open to everyone.  f  CELEBRATING  BRAIN  SCIENCE  AWARENESS  WEEK  AND  NATIONAL BRAIN  INJURY AWARENESS MONTH  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)

198,House,114,0.4,37,2015-03-17,Mr. MOOLENAAR.," Thank you very  much. I want to thank my colleague  from Indiana for his leadership organizing this presentation today.  Mr. Speaker, as it is clear from the  charts and the discussion we have already had today, Washington has a  spending problem.  In January, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the  Federal Government would collect $3.4  trillion in revenue in fiscal year 2016.  The week after that, the Obama administration  released  a  $4  trillion  spending plan that raises taxes and  MOOLENAAR JOHN  JOHN never balances, a refusal to live within  the government’s means.  Out-of-control Federal spending has  exploded the national debt. In 2014, revenue to the Federal Government was 49  percent higher than in 2000. Yet, spending for 2014 was 95 percent higher than  2000.  As part of the economy, the debt is  at  its highest point since the 1950s.  Much of the problem is spending required by unsustainable government  programs. This spending has increased  dramatically and crowded out funding  for national security and other priorities.  Mandatory  spending alone  in  2014  cost $2.3 trillion, more than was spent  funding the entire government in 2004.  As a member of the House Budget  Committee, I have worked with our  colleagues to craft a budget that addresses our country’s fiscal challenges.  The House Republican budget balances  within  10 years and does not  raise  taxes.  It reforms unsustainable government  programs while keeping the promises  that have been made to our seniors. It  grants flexibility to the States on Medicaid, allowing them to craft their own  health care programs for those in need.  This change brings Medicaid closer to  the American people it was meant to  serve.  I hope that Members of both parties,  in both the Senate and the House, will  be able to come together and address  the budget in a responsible way, without raising taxes on hardworking families who have seen their wages stagnate during this historically slow economic recovery.  The House Republican budget puts  our country on a path toward a more  stable and responsible fiscal future.  ",2015

200,Senate,114,-0.635,79,2015-03-17,Mr. BOOKER.," I appreciate that, and I  hope we all in the Senate can deal with  the same set of facts. We are entitled  to different opinions and different conclusions regarding the  facts, but we  should not be debating facts when we  have them here before us.  So let’s take a look at those facts. In  2011, the sentencing commission issued  a comprehensive study about mandatory minimum sentences. The study  found that almost 55,000 people were in  Federal  prisons  serving mandatory  minimum sentences for a drug crime.  That was more than 50 percent of all  Federal drug offenders and more than a  quarter—25  percent—of  all  Federal  prisoners, period.  Second, the great majority of Federal  drug offenders do not use violence. Let  me say that one more time because it  is  very  important. We  are  talking  about in this bill nonviolent offenders,  and the great majority do not use violence. The  sentencing  commission’s  most recent data shows that less than  1 percent of offenders used or threatened  violence  in  committing  their  crime, and no weapons—no weapons—  were involved in more than 80 percent  of drug cases.  Third, many of those serving mandatory minimum drug sentences are low-  level offenders. It is true that certain  low-level offenders such as the couriers  don’t often receive mandatory minimums. But other  low-level offenders  frequently are sentenced to mandatory  minimums.  For example, among those who are  most  likely to receive a mandatory  minimum  sentence  are  street-level  dealers—those who  sell  less  than  1  ounce of a drug. Almost 45 percent of  street-level dealers are serving mandatory minimums in Federal prison.  Finally, these mandatory minimum  sentences are lengthy. They are costly.  They drain taxpayer resources. A recent  sentencing  commission  study  shows that the average sentence  for  mandatory  minimums  was  132  months—11 years  in Federal  prison  without parole.  Some  claim  also  that mandatory  minimum prison sentences are not a  major factor in the massive increase in  the Federal prison population and overcrowding in Federal prisons. Remember, in the last 30 years, we have had an  explosion in our Federal prison population—800 percent. Some people say  that mandatory minimums have had  nothing to do with that. I look to my  colleague from Utah to respond. Is that  true?  ",2015
201,Senate,114,0.919,79,2015-03-17,Mr. LEE.," It is not true. It is simply  inaccurate. So those who insist that  our  exploding Federal  prison  population somehow has nothing to do with  the explosive use of mandatory minimum prison sentences within our Federal system are simply wrong.  In  its  2011  report,  the U.S. Sentencing Commission  concluded  that  mandatory minimums have had ‘‘a significant impact on the Federal prison  population.’’  From 1995 through 2010, the number  of Federal prisoners serving a mandatory minimum  sentence  grew  from  29,603 to 75,579. That is a 155-percent increase. It represents over one-third of  all Federal prisoners.  As of December 2014, over 59 percent  of the 210,567 Federal inmates—125,000  inmates over all—had been convicted  of an offense carrying a mandatory  minimum. Of these, 74.3 percent, which  represents  91,806  inmates, were  required to serve that mandatory minimum sentence or more.  In 2013, 62.1 percent of all drug offenders were convicted of an offense  carrying a mandatory minimum. Over  60 percent of them received no safety  valve relief and 70 percent of them did  not receive relief for cooperating with  authorities.  Some have argued that those serving  sentences for nonviolent drug offenses  have  long and violent criminal histories, but sentencing commission data  shows this is inaccurate. In 2013, 49.6  percent of drug offenders had little or  no criminal history, and only 7 percent  of drug offenders were sentenced under  the ‘‘career offender’’ sentencing guideline, which requires two prior convictions for a drug offense or a crime of  violence.  But here is the important point: The  Smarter Sentencing Act reduces certain mandatory minimum  sentences  for nonviolent drug offenses, but we do  not lower the maximum sentence. That  means a judge can sentence offenders  all the way up to the statutory maximum if she determines it is appropriate under the circumstances.

202,,114,-0.404,93,2015-03-17,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to remember the life of Mr. Alexander E. ‘ ‘Al’ ’  Teodosio, 90, who passed away on Tuesday,  February 10,  in  the presence of his  loving  family.  Al dedicated his life to spending time with  his family and friends, showing compassion to  others, and while serving his country  in  the  armed  forces. Al honorably  served during  World War II as a Private First Class in the  Army Air Corps Squadron in the Pacific Theater and demonstrated  tremendous strength  and courage throughout his tenure. After his  service Al returned to the states and became  a widely respected attorney and practiced for  many years in the city of Akron, Ohio with his  late brother, Ernie.  In 1950, Al married  the  love of his life Anna and the two shared over  64 years of love and happiness together. Regardless of his official title, Al aimed to make  his community a better place  to call home;  and he undoubtedly succeeded. From 1976 to  1990, he served as Chairman of the Summit  County Democratic Party, and made it a priority to inspire and mentor other local public  servants.  Al was preceded in death by his loving parents; dear siblings; son, Alan; and granddaughter, Andrea. He is survived by his loving  wife Anna Marie; children, Mary Anne, Thomas, Carol Anne, Robert, Alex; grandchildren,  Christine,  Kathleen,  Joseph,  Christopher,  David,  Lexi, Nicholas,  Joseph, Ellen,  and  Alice. Perhaps  the most  fitting  tribute  to Al  was written by his own children commemorating  the Teodosio’s 60th wedding anniversary in 2010. ‘ ‘Thank you mom and dad,’ ’ it  read,  ‘for  teaching us  the meaning of  love,  commitment, and  family. ’ ’ My dear  friend Al  helped to make the world a brighter place and  he will be dearly missed.  f  A  TRIBUTE  TO  SANDRA  CARAVELLA—28TH  CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT WOMAN  OF  THE YEAR  HON.

203,,114,-0.348,93,2015-03-17,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  honor of Women ’s History Month. Each year,  we pay special tribute to the contributions and  sacrifices made by our nation ’s women. It is  an  honor  to  pay  homage  to  outstanding  women who are making a difference  in my  Congressional District. I would like to recognize a remarkable woman, Sandra Caravella  of Atwater Village, a unique neighborhood in  Los Angeles, California.  Born and raised in the Atwater Village area  of  Los  Angeles, Ms. Caravella  attended  Atwater Elementary School, Irving Junior High  School and John Marshall High School. With  the exception of a few years when she and  her husband, Joe, also an Atwater Village native, resided in Michigan, Sandra has been a  lifetime resident of Atwater Village, where she  and Joe  raised  their  family. While a young  mother, Sandra  volunteered  at  her  sons’  school, Atwater Avenue Elementary School as  a teacher’s aide, and became involved in the  Parent Teacher Association. When her youngest son was six years old, she took a part time  job at the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau working as a registration supervisor  at  conventions,  seminars  and  trade  shows, where she remained for over two decades.  Well  regarded  in  her  community, Ms.  Caravella is a passionate and dedicated volunteer. She is a founding member and current  Board member of the Friends of Atwater Village (FAV), whose first venture was to successfully save the historic Van de Kamp Bakery building. As a FAV Board member, Sandra  has been instrumental in attaining grants for  community beautification projects that include  murals  illustrating  the area’s history,  flower  containers, and a decorative gate at the Los  Angeles River and Acresite Street. With three  other FAV Board members, she produced calendars featuring local history and a book entitled: Images of America: Atwater Village. Ms.  Caravella is a member of the Atwater Village  Chamber of Commerce, was  the chamber’s  project manager of  the sign committee, and  serves on the Tree Lighting and River Committees for the Atwater Village Neighborhood  Council.  Married  for nearly half a century, Sandra  and her husband, Joe, have  two sons, Jeff  and Brian, two grandsons, Vincenzo and Nico,  all of whom live in Atwater Village.  I ask all Members to join me in honoring an  exceptional woman of California’s 28th Congressional District, Sandra Caravella.  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

205,House,114,0.24,2,2015-03-24,Mr. JONES.," In recent days, the waste  of billions of dollars in Afghanistan has  been dominating the headlines:  March 20 of this year, ‘‘Afghanistan  Can’t Manage Billions in Aid, U.S. Inspector Finds’’; March 14, 2015, ‘‘C.I.A.  Cash Ended Up in Coffers of Al Qaeda’’;  May 4, 2013, ‘‘Karzai Says He Was Assured C.I.A. Would Continue Delivering  Bags of Cash.’’  Mr. Speaker, the squandering of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars by the  Afghan Government is one small aspect  of the rampant waste, fraud, and abuse  in Afghanistan.  The House is looking to vote on the  budget produced by the Republican majority this week which continues billions of dollars the military deserves,  but the billions of dollars going to Afghanistan are a waste. The Republican  budget also provides billions of dollars  for  emergency war  funding  to  get  around sequestration. Why do we have  sequestration  in the  first place? Because Congress has not passed an honest budget in years.  A couple of weeks ago, the House  Armed Services Committee had a hearing on U.S. policy  in Afghanistan,  where I asked General John Campbell,  U.S. Army, commander of the International Security Assistance Force and  United States Forces in Afghanistan, if  he will ever have a successor who will  be honest with Congress and the American people about the fact that we have  done as much as we can do in Afghanistan. He did not give me a direct answer, but his response was this: ‘‘For  very  little continued  investment, we  can make this a shining light of central Asia.’’  Mr. Speaker, if I had had more time,  I would have asked General Campbell  what his definition of ‘‘very little continued investment’’ is when we have already spent billions and billions of dollars and spilled blood in Afghanistan.  There are bridges, roads, educational  needs, and veterans benefits to provide  here in the United States. Let’s focus  on their needs rather than on chasing  something that will never happen. History has proven Afghanistan will never  change. It is a graveyard of empires.  Mr. Speaker, without a debate  in  Congress, President Obama signed a Bilateral Security Agreement with Afghanistan to keep our United States  troops there for 9 more years. Let’s cut  the 9 years to 3 or 4 years and bring our  troops home.  Finally, with an ever-climbing $18  trillion debt, the American people are  frustrated. Congress needs to impose  spending  controls  to  save  taxpayer  money.  Mr. Speaker, may God continue to  bless our men and women in uniform,  and may God continue to bless America.  f  THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET  ",2015
206,House,114,-0.428,2,2015-03-24,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  this week marks the latest chapter in  the drama of Republican control of  Congress. This  is  their  first opportunity with complete control of both  Chambers  to bring  into  focus what  they would do governing, and the results aren’t pretty.  We are discussing this week a budget  that has been labeled by press accounts  that actually give them the benefit of  the doubt as being phony or a disaster.  It has been condemned by many conservative commentators as a sham.  The purported $5.5 trillion in budget  savings over the next 10 years provides  no good explanation about how it can  actually be achieved. There is a trillion  dollars  in  unspecified  reductions  ‘‘other mandatory  programs.’’ They  would abolish the Affordable Care Act,  but somehow keep all of the revenues  that finance it.  There are a  few areas of  clarity  which  are  hardly  comforting.  The  ratcheting down support for our low-income  college  students  through Pell  grants is hardly a step forward and will  be widely condemned the more clearly  people understand it.  We are back to the Medicare voucher,  which may have a different name but is  still toxic. A measure of their understanding of its unpopularity is their refusal to put it into effect for seniors  now. Instead they would have people  approaching retirement age  in their  mid-fifties who will be able to enjoy  the  benefits  and  uncertainty  of  a  vouchered Medicare program.  It is silent on the transportation crisis that is already upon us. The latest  transportation extension expires May  31. Resources are not going to be available to get us through this fiscal year,  let alone the next fiscal year that they  would budget for. And if the budget  that they have foreseen would somehow be enacted as written, the next fiscal year would see massive cuts  for  every single State across the country  for transportation.  It continues to chip away at the ability of the Federal Government to hire  and maintain  the  skilled workforce  Americans depend upon. One of the  most bizarre examples is their continued attack on the ability of the IRS,  the Internal Revenue Service, to perform the functions necessary to finance  our government.  What business cripples its accounts  receivable department? And the proof  of this approach is available to any  American who tries to call the IRS to  get information. It is almost impossible to get through now, let alone with  the budget cuts that are anticipated.  You can ask any CPA in your district  about the devastating effects of crippling the IRS on not just the average  citizen, but even on people who can  hire the best legal and accounting services available.  While the IRS may be an attractive  target for their assault on government,  the attack is not limited to the Internal Revenue or the EPA. This budget  will  have  crippling  effects  on  the  American way of  life all across the  country. This budgetary approach that  is already baked in produces fewer people to be able to deal with the services  for the exploding number of retired  people seeking help from the Social Security Administration. It shortchanges  the maintenance of our national parks.  It underfunds medical research that  can make a huge difference for American families.  Mr. Speaker, there are things that  could be done. I introduced legislation  this week,  the REIN-IN Act, which  would cut $100 billion of unnecessary  spending on nuclear weapons over the  next 10 years. These savings could be  used to shore up the Department of Defense without resorting to the budget  gimmicks that they are using.  That  is the bitter reality of their  budget approach. It is not their theatrics or the creative terminology. Republicans are avoiding the hard questions and reasonable solutions. It  is  simply an assault on providing Americans with the services they want, need,  VerDate Sep 11 2014  00:19 Mar 25, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24MR7.004 H24MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o r e c n e p S S         ",2015
207,House,114,0.69,37,2015-03-24,Mr. LAMBORN.," I thank the chairman for his hard work on this budget.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support  of the House Republican budget with  the defense fix. Our country needs to  get back on a  responsible  financial  path, a path that protects our national  security, repeals ObamaCare, and reforms  our  entitlement  programs  so  they are sustainable.  Mr. Chairman, I want to remind us of  the rapidly deteriorating security situation we  face. Russia has  invaded  Ukraine. ISIS is spreading. Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons and long-range  missiles while actively supporting terrorist organizations around the world.  North Korea is pursuing a submarine-  launched ballistic missile capability to  go with its nuclear weapons program.  China is threatening our friends and allies in Asia. This is just a laundry list  of bad actors that threaten the very  safety of our Nation.  Meanwhile, President Obama’s  foreign policy is a disaster, which puts us  at even greater risk. Shockingly, the  President is even turning his back on  Israel, damaging our partnership with  our closest ally in the Middle East.  Our military has already faced drastic cuts. The Air Force is the smallest  it has ever been. The Army is on a path  to being the smallest since 1940. The  Navy will soon be the smallest since  1915.  Mr. Chairman, I firmly believe most  Americans agree that now is not the  time  to  cut  our  national  security  spending. Russia isn’t cutting its military budget. Iran isn’t cutting its military budget. ISIS certainly isn’t cutting its military budget.  I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this budget by voting ‘‘yes’’  on Price 2. This is a vital step in keeping our military strong in the face of  dangerous threats around the world.  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chairman, I  am now really pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky  (Mr. YARMUTH), a member of the Budget Committee.  ",2015
208,House,114,-0.379,37,2015-03-24,Mr. YARMUTH.," I thank my friend  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, as a 6-year member of  the Budget Committee and the second  ranking Democrat,  I have seen this  budget proposal up close and personal.  I have seen the way it has been reshaped over the years, from its early  days as the first Ryan budget, to the  collection of budget tricks and gimmicks we find before us today.  Despite the highly questionable math  and mysterious growth projections, the  consequences are clear. This budget  hurts American  families now and  in  the future, hitting their pocketbooks  and  their  checkbooks  today while  disinvesting in our and their future.  It immediately raises taxes on the  hard-working families who are simply  looking  for a shot at the American  Dream: owning a home, providing their  kids with access to a good education,  living a healthy life, and being able to  save for retirement while their parents  enjoy theirs.  It makes college more expensive for  those families, cutting Pell grants by  $90 billion and eliminating higher education tax credits. It cuts investment  in our infrastructure and innovation,  leaving us less competitive in the global economy.  This budget takes more than 16 million men, women, and children off of  the health insurance plan they have  now, thanks to the Affordable Care  Act. People will, again, be denied care  because of preexisting conditions. Lifetime caps on coverage return.  If the Affordable Care Act were repealed, as proposed in the Republicans’  ‘‘work harder for less’’ budget, here is  what would happen in my State: more  than 500,000 Kentuckians would  lose  their healthcare coverage.  We wouldn’t gain the 40,000 new jobs  that are projected over the next 6 years  because of the Affordable Care Act, and  the Kentucky budget would miss out  on $800 million more in revenue.  For  seniors,  this budget ends  the  guarantee of Medicare as we know it.  Prescription drug costs will go up on  day one. Copays will increase. The prescription drug doughnut hole will reopen.  Eventually, seniors will be given a  voucher and sent on their way, told to  find their own health plan—ironically,  something that very, very closely resembles the healthcare exchanges that  our friends on the other side despise so  much.  This is not what the American people  want. They want us to invest in our  people, invest in innovation, and continue our economic recovery by creating new opportunities.  The Democratic budget will do just  that, cutting taxes for working families, making college more affordable,  health care more accessible, and retirement more secure.  It is time we reward hard work, and  I urge my colleagues to reject the Republican budget and support the Democratic alternative.  ",2015

Mr. Chairman, this budget goes a  long way to address the out-of-control  spending problem and crushing debt  the administration has  fostered over  the last few years.

227,Senate,114,0.615,79,2015-03-24,Mr. COTTON.," Mr. President, since its  founding  in  1948,  Israel has been a  strong and steadfast ally to the United  States  in the Middle East, a region  characterized by  instability and violence.  The U.S.-Israel relationship is built  on mutual respect for common values,  including a commitment to democracy,  the rule of law, individual liberty, and  ethnic and religious diversity.  Last week, President Obama  and  other  administration  officials  suggested a  fundamental  rethinking of  this alliance, citing Prime Minister  Netanyahu’s simple restatement of fact  that there can be no Palestinian State  until conditions change. The Palestinian Authority must, at a minimum,  eject Hamas from its governing coalition, reclaim control of the Gaza Strip,  accept a demilitarized eastern border,  and recognize Israel’s right to exist as  a Jewish State.  Further, Prime Minister Netanyahu  recently reiterated these points and his  support  for a  two-state  solution  in  principle. In this light, any suggestion  that the United States may reconsider  our support for Israel—especially our  support  at  the United Nations—is  wrongheaded and shortsighted, because  the United Nations, regrettably, has  consistently employed a double standard in its treatment of Israel, making  false allegations against Israel while,  even worse, ignoring even worse behavior by other countries.  The  U.N.  has  often  Israel’s legitimacy——  ",2015

Captain Blomme graduated from the  U.S. Coast Guard Academy in 1985. His  illustrious,  30-year  career  includes  nearly 12 years of sea duty and command of three Coast Guard cutters,  command of Coast Guard Sector Jacksonville, FL, and service as Military  Assistant to the Secretary of Homeland Security during the terms of Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Napolitano.  Commander Walsh graduated  from  the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in 1993.  His distinguished career includes service aboard U.S. and allied vessels, multiple assignments as a Coast Guard aviator, and service as Military Aide to  the President of the United States during the terms of President George W.  Bush and President Barack Obama.  Commander Walsh will next assume  the Coast Guard Service Chair at the  National War College in Washington,  DC where he will serve as a service representative and instructor.  Lieutenant Commander Potter graduated from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in 1999. His noteworthy career includes 2 years aboard the Coast Guard  Cutter Hamilton, operational assignments at two air stations, and service  as an MH–60T flight examiner at the  U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training  Center in Mobile, AL. Lieutenant Commander Potter will be assigned to U.S.  Coast Guard Sector San Diego where  he will serve as the sector response  chief.  I congratulate Captain Blomme and  thank him  for his selfless and dedicated service to our Nation. I wish him  and his family all the best in their future  endeavors  following his  retirement from the Coast Guard this spring.  I would also like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Commander Walsh and Lieutenant Commander Potter for all of the fine work  they have done and for their continued  service to our Nation. I wish them further success in the years to come.∑  f  MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE  At 11:46 a.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks,  announced that the House has passed  the following bills, in which it requests  the concurrence of the Senate:  H.R. 233.

229,,114,-0.408,149,2015-03-24,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  I  am  pleased to introduce the United States–Caribbean Partnership Act of 2015, along with my  friends and colleagues Representatives GREGORYMEEKS, FREDERICAWILSON, ALCEEHASTINGS, BARBARA LEE, YVETTE CLARKE, LOIS  FRANKEL, ALBIOSIRESand TEDDEUTCH. This  bill will establish embassies in the five Caribbean countries where we currently have no  physical  diplomatic  presence —Antigua  and  Barbuda, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St.  Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  Five years ago, President Obama attended  the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and  Tobago and declared  that,  ‘It’s appropriate  and important that we hold this summit in the  Caribbean. The energy, the dynamism, the diversity of the Caribbean people inspires us all,  and  is such an  important part of what we  share in common as a hemisphere.’ ’ I could  not agree more. As we approach the upcoming Summit of the Americas in Panama next  month, the United States must redouble our  commitment to the people of the Caribbean.  That is precisely why I am introducing this bill  today.  I ask my colleagues  to  imagine countries  where tens of thousands of American citizens  travel  for pleasure or business; where  thousands of American  citizens go  to  school;  where there is a constant concern about drug  trafficking to the United States; but where the  United States has no U.S. embassies.

Candice Codr  is an 8th grader at Wheat Ridge 5-8 and received this award because her determination  and hard work have allowed her to overcome  adversities.  The dedication demonstrated by Candice  Codr is exemplary of the type of achievement  that can be attained with hard work and perseverance. It is essential students at all levels  strive to make the most of their education and  develop a work ethic which will guide them for  the rest of their lives.  I  extend my  deepest  congratulations  to  Candice Codr for winning the Arvada Wheat  Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.  I have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication and character  in all of her  future accomplishments.  f  TRIBUTE TO JACK HAWKINS  HON. PETE OLSON  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 24, 2015  ",2015
231,,114,0.54,156,2015-03-24,Mr. OLSON.," Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to  interact with some of the brightest students in  the 22nd Congressional District who serve on  my Congressional Youth Advisory Council.  I  have gained much by  listening  to  the high  school students who are  the  future of  this  great nation. They provide  important  insight  into the concerns of our younger constituents  and hopefully get a better sense of the importance of being an active participant in the political process. Many of the students have written short essays on a variety of topics and I  am pleased to share them with my House colleagues.  Jack Hawkins attends Pearland High School  in Pearland, Texas. The essay topic is: in your  opinion, what role should government play in  our lives?  The most important reason I believe Americans should be  involved  in the political  process is because of the right we were given  to vote for the leaders of our country. One  reason I believe this is a crucial role of citizens is because with this right it allows us to  vote into office the people who we believe  will pursue and advocate effectively what we  as citizens are needing from our city, state,  and federal government. This right is one of  the primary reasons our great nation was  founded, so that people could live in a democracy and advocate to officials what they  needed instead of having a monarchal (or  more commonly today) a dictatorship classification of government speak for them. But  more importantly, I believe citizens should  exercise this right because we have thousands of soldiers stationed all over the world  helping to both defend this right  for our  country, and try to help others achieve the  type of democratic government that we possess and believe in so prominently. Therefore  by exercising this right, it is a small way to  show our appreciation and gratefulness for  our troops by exercising this right that they  are fighting for so valiantly.  The  other  important  reason  I  believe  Americans should be involved in the political process is because with the election of  our nation’s  leaders  it  is has  repeatedly  proven by history that through former political  leaders,  specifically  past American  presidents, the United States has made substantial positive differences in both domestic  and international affairs. For example with  the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt who  transformed the country’s economy. With  the enacting of his New Deal policies Roosevelt was able to provide millions of Americans with jobs and economic security therefore helping America incredibly through the  Great Depression. Also America has made  major strides in international affairs such as  through President Obama who with the aid  of America’s top military leaders and the  United States’ Navy SEALs team was able to  kill Osama bin Laden, the leader of the terrorist group Al-Qaeda who was responsible  for horrific acts including most infamously  the bombing of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. Although it has not stopped  Al-Qaeda completely, President Obama along  with his esteemed colleagues made American  history and  showed  the  strength of  the  United States as an international power. The  United States is the by far the best country  in the world and  it  is repeatedly shown  through the election of our country’s leaders  who throughout history and in the future  will continue to show America’s greatness  both domestically and internationally if the  citizens of our magnificent country continue  to take an active role in America’s political  process.  f  CONGRATULATING  LEROY  AND  OVIA MARIE MCGINNIS ON THEIR  65TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY  HON.

232,,114,0.611,156,2015-03-24,Mr. SMITH of Missouri.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to congratulate Leroy and Ovia Marie  McGinnis on their 65th wedding anniversary.  They were married on March 3, 1950  in a  courthouse  in Arkansas. Although  they were  young, their love for one another was unconditional. In fact, Leroy was so intent on marrying  the love of his life that he spent the last four  dollars  to his name  to pay  for  their modest  ceremony. Worried of what their families might  think, Leroy and Ovia Marie kept  their marriage a secret for several weeks.  Soon  after marrying,  the  young  couple  moved to Cuba, Missouri, where their love and  affection  for one another continued  to grow.  They have raised six children  together, and  Mr. McGinnis still serves as CEO of McGinnis  Wood Products, a very successful business  that he founded in 1968.  Again, I want to wish Mr. and Mrs. McGinnis  a Happy Anniversary and many more years of  joy!  f  HERMANTOWN FIFTH-GRADERS  HON. RICHARD M.

The students who have  stepped forward to meet an important community need are Bryanna Kliegle, Alexa Aagenes  and Ani Jovanovich of Hermantown Middle  School.  I don ’t think I have to remind anyone that  winters  in Minnesota can be very cold. We  Minnesotans are hardy souls and deal with it.  But with the cold temperatures, there is a silent killer  that unfortunately creeps  into our  communities every year as people try to warm  their homes.

234,House,114,-0.579,10,2015-04-13,Mr. CAPUANO.," Mr. Speaker, on most  social issues, I consider myself a liberal. On most fiscal matters, I consider  myself a conservative in the true sense  of the word, not the new sense of the  word, meaning that you should pay for  those things that you want.  When it comes to privacy matters, I  consider myself a proud Libertarian.  There is absolutely no reason for anyone who doesn’t need information that  I don’t want them to have to get, period. It is my information, my information to share only with those with  whom I wish to share it.  This bill takes one step further towards keeping my information private  and confidential between me and those  people I seek to share it with. It is a  great bill. I look forward to voting for  it.  This information is necessary to be  shared to simply keep our  financial  services system going, but there is no  reason whatsoever to allow  it to be  nonconfidential  and  to  be  spread  around and be available to anybody  who might want to look at it.  I support the passage of this bill. I  congratulate Mr. DOLD for putting this  forward for us to vote on, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  ",2015
235,House,114,0.176,10,2015-04-13,Mr. DOLD.," Mr. Speaker, I certainly  want to thank the chairman for his  leadership. I want to thank my good  friend from Massachusetts, and I also  want to comment on the fact that we  are delighted that you are a Libertarian on some of these things.  As we look, Mr. Speaker, at H.R. 1480,  the SAFE Act Confidentiality  and  Privilege Enhancement Act,  it preserves the ability of the State and Federal financial regulators to share information regarding consumer  financial  services businesses that are licensed at  the State level in the National Mortgage Licensing System without losing  the privilege and confidentiality protections provided by State and Federal  law.  This  is a bipartisan bill that promotes smart and efficient regulation  among State  regulators.  It  ensures  that State regulators can talk to their  colleagues across State lines regarding  multistate  financial  service  entities  without  losing  traditional  privilege  and constitutionality protections.  These amendments are needed due to  the unintended gap in the existing National Mortgage  Licensing  System  statute. As State regulators have expanded their use of the NMLS in order  to enhance consumer protections, to  combat fraud, increase uniformity, and  reduce regulatory burdens in licensing  processes, privacy protections have not  kept up.  This is a commonsense bill that provides  regulators with  the  certainty  that they can continue to share information and collaborate with their colleagues across State lines.  Protecting the integrity of the National Mortgage Licensing System is  important because  it better protects  consumers from bad actors who switch  States for licensing purposes to evade  scrutiny.  This is ensuring, Mr. Speaker, smart  regulations.  Again, I talk to people all around my  district. The fact is that we are not  against regulations. We just want our  regulations to be smart and tailored,  and this is one of those things that,  again, working across the aisle and  trying to find common ground, this is  one that I believe that we can agree on.  H.R. 1480 does not create any new  privilege or confidentiality rights. It  merely ensures that the existing privilege  and  confidentiality  protections  are  retained  when  information  is  shared  through  the National Mortgaging Licensing System so that regulators can share information and communicate.  H.R. 1480 has received support from  the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the Credit Union National Association, and the Illinois Department of  Financial and Professional Regulation,  in my home State.  The SAFE Act Confidentiality and  Privilege Enhancement Act passed out  of this committee, out of the Financial  Services Committee, 58–0. I certainly  urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and look forward to its passage.  ",2015
236,House,114,-0.393,17,2015-04-13,Ms. SEWELL of Alabama.," Thank you  so much. I want to commend my colleagues from Illinois and New Jersey  for having this wonderful CBC hour on  minority health and  the disparities  that exist.  I want to talk for a minute about  how we in Congress have tried to address these disparities. You know, our  Nation celebrated the fifth anniversary  of the Affordable Care Act in March.  This anniversary marked the historic  progress our Nation has made towards  making health care not just a privilege, but a right for every American.  The ACA has significantly affected  the minority population by trying to  close the gap on the disparity by giving  access to affordable healthcare insurance for all Americans. Thanks to the  ACA, health  insurers can no  longer  deny coverage to individuals because of  preexisting conditions, and women no  longer have to pay higher premiums  than men. Because of this law, millions  of Americans can finally afford to go to  the doctor, and families no longer risk  losing their home savings and all that  they have  if a  family member gets  sick.  For those who already had insurance,  the ACA has meant new savings and  new protections. This has even been  true in my home State of Alabama, a  State that did not choose to enact a  healthcare exchange, a State that did  not expand Medicaid. During the most  recent enrollment period, more than  171,000 Alabamians enrolled in quality  healthcare coverage at a price that  they could afford. Over 1.1 million Alabamians with private health insurance  now have access  to  free preventive  services, and Alabamians with Medicare have saved more than $240 million  in  prescription  drug  costs.  In  2014  alone, nearly 90,000 Alabamians saved  an average of $931  for prescriptions.  Yes, even  in my State of Alabama,  which chose not to enact a healthcare  exchange and not to expand Medicaid,  the ACA is working.  These are more than just numbers.  Greater access to healthcare insurance  leads to a healthier population, which  is good news not only for Alabamians,  but for all Americans. The ACA, indeed, works. That is why I have proudly defended the ACA against numerous  attacks to undermine or repeal the  law. Bipartisanship is possible. Members from both sides of the aisle in both  Chambers must  work  together  to  strengthen our healthcare system and  to ensure that all Americans have access to quality, affordable healthcare  insurance.  In March, I was proud that 392 of us  in the House of Representatives agreed  on a permanent fix to the flawed Medicare physician payment system and an  extension to the Children’s Health Insurance Program, otherwise known as  CHIP.  This  bipartisan  agreement  marked a historic victory for our children of this Nation. It also was a victory for our seniors, working class families,  and  healthcare  providers. We  must continue to work together to ensure the healthcare system is working  for all of us.  Unfortunately,  for many working  poor individuals and families, access to  quality health care is still out of their  reach. An estimated 191,000 Alabamians,  for example, are uninsured because our Governor has refused to expand Medicaid. Let me repeat that.  191,000 Alabamians would benefit if our  Governor would expand Medicaid in the  State of Alabama. These  individuals  pay their taxes, work hard, and contribute to their communities. Our government should assist them in return.  Governor Robert Bentley recently created  the Alabama Health Care  Improvement Task Force  to  examine  ways to increase access to health care  in rural Alabama.  b2000  I welcome my Governor’s establishment of this task force. I know that  when this task force meets, it will recommend expanding Medicaid.  My hope is that we will put partisan  politics aside in my great State of Alabama and look to what is in the best  interest  of  all  the  people. Clearly,  191,000 Alabamians  fall  in that gap,  those  who  currently  cannot  get  healthcare  insurance  because  this  State would refuse to expand Medicaid.  I find it ironic, Mr. Speaker, that my  Governor would choose to recommend  expanding taxes.

250,,114,-0.276,52,2015-04-13,Mr. REID.," Mr. President. I rise today  to recognize Mrs. Ethelene Thompson.  She was born on June 6, 1925,  in  Water Valley, MS, as the third child of  Minnie and Solomon Morgan. Today,  Ethelene is a caregiver known to many  in her community for her willingness  to provide free childcare and transportation  to  those  in need. She  lived  through the Great Depression, World  War II, the civil rights movement, and  the election and tenure of the first African-American President. In 1946, she  married Willie Thompson, and  they  raised six beautiful daughters, until his  passing in 2000.  Mrs. Thompson  has  been  instrumental in helping raise her 14 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren, and 4  great-great-grandchildren.  She  is  known to give selflessly of her time  and wisdom and to countless folks in  her neighborhood and at her church.  She helped lead the Girl Scout troops  for her daughters and granddaughters,  ensured  that her grandson and his  friends made it to every sports practice  and game, and has served faithfully as  a member of the Bloomfield Full Gospel Baptist Church for more than 50  years, where she has been a member of  the choir, Sunday school, and kitchen  ministry.

251,,114,-0.374,52,2015-04-13,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, while the  Senate was in recess, Loretta Lynch,  the nominee to be our next Attorney  General,  announced  that her  office  brought charges against two residents  of Queens, NY, for conspiring to use  weapons of mass destruction and plotting a terrorist attack on American  soil. U.S. Attorney Lynch continues to  work tirelessly to protect our Nation,  but the Senate Republican leadership  continues to play politics with our law  enforcement  and has  prevented  the  Senate from fulfilling one of our most  essential  constitutional  duties—the  duty to provide advice and consent on  Presidential nominations. The  same  baseless political obstructionism that  has stalled Ms. Lynch’s nomination has  also led to the Senate’s failure to confirm a single Federal judge so far this  year.  As one of the country’s top Federal  prosecutors, Loretta Lynch has an unparalleled record of keeping Americans  safe from dangerous criminals and terrorists. This  includes  the  successful  prosecution of six individuals for their  roles in a 2009 Al Qaeda plot to attack  the New York subway system, the convictions of four terrorists who plotted  an attack on John F. Kennedy Airport,  and the conviction of a terrorist who  sought to detonate an explosive device  at the New York Federal Reserve. Despite her distinguished record of service, the Republican leadership is trying  to use Ms. Lynch’s nomination for political gain. This is not how the Senate  should be  treating a nomination of  such  importance to  law enforcement  and our national security.  It has now been more than 5 months  since President Obama announced the  nomination of Ms. Lynch to be Attorney General. Her nomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee  with bipartisan support in February,  yet it has been pending before the full  Senate for 46 days. That is nearly twice  as long as all of the past seven Attorneys  General  combined:  Richard  Thornburgh,  1 day; William Barr,  5  days; Janet Reno, 1 day; John Ashcroft,  2 days, Alberto Gonzales, 8 days; Michael Mukasey, 2 days; and Eric Holder, 5 days. This historic delay is an embarrassment for the Senate.  In January, Ms. Lynch testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee  for nearly 8 hours and she responded to  nearly 900 written questions. Not a single witness invited by Republicans opposed her nomination. When Republicans  stalled  consideration  of Ms.  Lynch’s  nomination  in  committee,  Democrats  noted  the  unnecessary  delay and raised concerns about filling  this vital position. The assistant Republican leader dismissed this as ‘‘faux  outrage.’’ But in November 2007, that  same Senator complained  that a  7-  week process on the Mukasey nominaIt is imperative that the president has his  national security team at full strength and  the unnecessary delay of Judge Mukasey’s  nomination has prevented that. He deserves  an immediate up-or-down vote by the full  Senate.  Similarly, in early October 2007—just  3 weeks after Mr. Mukasey’s nomination was announced, the Republican  leader criticized me for not yet having  set a hearing date, saying that Democrats should ‘‘not hold Judge Mukasey  hostage  while  they  play  partisan  games.’’ This is the same Republican  leader who is now holding Ms. Lynch’s  nomination hostage and who has kept  her nomination  languishing  on  the  floor for nearly twice as long as the  past  seven Attorneys General  combined.  No one can deny that Ms. Lynch is  eminently qualified  for the  job. The  Republican  leader should schedule a  vote on Ms. Lynch’s nomination today.  She has the votes to be confirmed, and  a vote on this highly qualified nominee  is  long overdue. The Majority must  stop playing political games with our  law enforcement.  We should also be voting on all 10 judicial nominees who have been pending  in the Senate since last year, two of  whom  just passed  the  1-year mark  since they were first nominated. Tonight, we will consider  just one of  those nominees. Once confirmed, Alfred Bennett will fill a ‘‘judicial emergency’’ vacancy in the Southern District of Texas that has been empty for  more than 2 years. There is no good explanation why it has taken us nearly 7  months to vote on his nomination, nor  is there a good reason for why we are  not voting on the other two pending  nominees to district court vacancies in  Texas. There are still two Fifth Circuit  vacancies and seven other Federal district  court  vacancies  in Texas  for  which there are no nominees. Texas  has two times the number of Federal  court vacancies of any other State, and  these vacancies account for one-third  of the judicial emergency vacancies on  our Nation’s courts. I urge the Texas  Senators to work with the President so  that we can receive nominees for those  vacancies as soon as possible.  Despite promises to govern responsibly, the Republican majority has continued to obstruct when it comes to judicial vacancies. When Senate Democrats were  in the majority, we confirmed 15 of President Bush’s district  and circuit court nominees by April  2007. We confirmed 68 judges during the  last 2 years of the Bush administration, building on a record I established  at the very beginning of the Bush Presidency when 100 judges were confirmed  in the 17 months that I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

Law enforcement is a demanding profession  that requires sacrifice, courage and a dedication  to serve others. Every day, brave men  and women put themselves in harm’s way to  enforce  the  laws of our society and protect  public safety. They deserve our gratitude and  respect.  Four years ago, I established the 16th District Congressional Law Enforcement Awards,  CLEA, to give special recognition to law enforcement officers, departments, or units  for  exceptional achievement.  This year, I will present congressional law  enforcement awards to the following winners  chosen by an independent panel comprised of  current and retired law enforcement personnel  representing a cross-section of  the district’s  law enforcement community.  Officer Steven Ogline of the Holmes Beach  Police Department will receive the Above and  Beyond  the Call of Duty Award and will be  named Congressional Officer of the Year.  Sergeant William F. Pascoe of the Florida  Highway Patrol will receive the Career Service  Award.  Deputy Dan Durrance and Deputy Christopher Folds of the Manatee County Sheriff’s  Office, Sergeant Brian Woodring and Deputy  Ryan Frailing of the Sarasota County Sheriff ’s  Office, Patrolman First Class Dustin Cohen of  the North Port Police Department and Officer  Lucciano Diaz of the Palmetto Police Department will  receive  the Preservation of Life  Award.  Detective Robert Armstrong of the Sarasota  City Police Department, Master Patrol Officer  Jose Santos of the Bradenton Police Department, Detective John McHenry of  the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office, Sergeant Scott  King of the North Port Police Department and  Officer Ruth Terry of  the Venice Police Department will receive the Dedication and Professionalism Award.

Mr. Ries  is  retiring  after 15 years with this organization; the office  he ran is part of LISC’s national network.  Mr. Ries has spent much of his career helping  improve  neighborhoods  in Milwaukee.  Prior to his employment at LISC, he worked  for  the City of Milwaukee  for 10 years, ultimately serving as Director of Housing and  Neighborhood Development. Mr. Ries’ heart  has always been  in neighborhood work; he  brought people and organizations together in  order to create projects that had a real impact  on  struggling  neighborhoods. He  has  remained optimistic regarding the future of Milwaukee’s neighborhoods even while acknowledging  the challenges of people struggling  against ‘ ‘hopelessness and helplessness’ ’; he  sees promise and opportunities in the resurgence of urban living especially by the millennial generation.  The son of a Sheboygan mink rancher, Ries  is the youngest of seven children. He attended  a seminary high school and thought for a time  he wanted to be a priest. Leo Ries has enjoyed an unusual and varied working life. He  worked as a volunteer at Casa Maria Catholic  Worker House, a cab driver, registered nurse  in an intensive care unit and as business manager for two inner-city Catholic churches.  Mr. Ries has worked on many  initiatives  during his tenure at LISC but he has identified  two recent projects as being especially meaningful. The relaunching of  the Associates  in  Commercial Real Estate  (ACRE) program,  which Marquette University  oversaw  from  2005 to 2010, to help introduce minorities to  careers in commercial real estate and working  with  the Milwaukee Police Department on  proactive  community  safety  strategies. He  sees both of these initiatives as providing a  structure for building relationships among people; people from different races came together  for these two projects with a shared interest in  building Milwaukee’s future.  LISC has accomplished so much under the  leadership of Leo Ries; programs  initiated  under his  tutelage have become models  for  the nation and made Milwaukee a strong,  prosperous community for all of its residents.  I am grateful to have had the opportunity to  know and work with Leo Ries  for so many  years and wish him much success as he transitions into a different phase of his life.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Leo Ries  and I am proud to call him friend. The citizens  of  the Fourth Congressional District and  the  State of Wisconsin are privileged  to have  someone of his ability and dedicated service  working on  their behalf  for so many years.  Leo, I thank you for all that you have done. I  am honored for these reasons to pay tribute to  Leo Ries.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF RAY BARBER  OF BOZRAH, CONNECTICUT  HON.

Ray Barber is a local institution with an extensive history of community and public service dating back  to his  teen years when he  joined the Bozrah Volunteer Fire Company in  1952. As Chief and  then President of  the  BVFC, Mr. Barber served through the town ’s  acquisition of its first fire truck in 1953, and  through the decades, helped grow the emergency services the town provides to its residents. Today, Bozrah is a heart-safe community with a full complement of EMTs and ambulance services thanks in large part to Mr.  Barber’s commitment to improving safety.  Mr. Barber’s contributions expand well beyond the BVFC. He served in the U.S. Army,  as First Selectman in Bozrah, for 20 years, on  the Bozrah Board of Finance, and in the Connecticut Council of Governments. It would be  an understatement to say that his skills and  passion for the region made his new role as  President of  the New London County Fire  Chiefs’ Association a richly deserved honor.  As President, Mr. Barber will  lead an 83-  year-old institution with 65 member organizations and will represent the interests of volunteer and career  fire  fighters across  the  region—over 3,000 personnel. I ask the House  to join me in thanking Ray Barber for his service,  congratulating  him  on  this  deserved  honor, and wishing him success in the years  to come.  f  IN HONOR OF COLONEL RANDOLPH  E.

256,,114,-0.379,1,2015-04-28,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, when the  Supreme Court ruled in 2013 to invalidate the preclearance formula in the  original Voting Rights Act, it issued a  challenge to Congress to pass an updated one. That is a challenge Congress  must accept. Until Congress acts, millions will continue to face barriers at  the ballot box.  On April 18, The New York Times editorial board highlighted the disturbing  and flawed argument that preclearance  is no longer necessary. Obviously, the  Congress of the United States found  otherwise.  The editorial stated:  ‘‘This process  . . . stopped hundreds of discriminatory new laws from taking effect, and  deterred lawmakers from introducing  countless more.’’  The process to which they were referring was the preclearance process that  the Supreme Court threw out. The editors cited a new study that analyzed  more than 4,000 rights cases.  They write again:  ‘‘The study provides the most wide-ranging empirical  evidence yet that Congress was amply  justified  in  finding  that voting discrimination remains concentrated  in  the covered States and regions.’’  When we  reauthorized  the Voting  Rights Act in 2006, Mr. Speaker, we did  so with an overwhelming vote of 390–33  in the House. In the Senate, Mr. Speaker, it was 98–0. There was no confusion,  there was no doubt in the minds of the  Congress of the United States, and that  bill was signed by President George  Bush. It was an overwhelmingly bipartisan conclusion that preclearance was  still necessary some 45 years after the  passage of the Voting Rights Act.  This has traditionally been an issue  that brings Democrats and Republicans  together, and I am proud to have cosponsored a bipartisan compromise bill  sponsored by Republican former chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, JIMSENSENBRENNER, who was the  sponsor  and  chairman  of  the  committee when the reauthorization was  effected in 2006.  The bill that we have  introduced,  called the Voting Rights Amendments  Act, with Republican former chairman  of the Committee on the Judiciary, JIM  SENSENBRENNER, and Ranking Member  JOHNCONYERS, as well as JOHNLEWIS—  great hero of the civil rights movement—that would answer the Supreme  Court with an updated preclearance  formula, as they suggested. In fact, in  the past 2 years since the Court’s ruling, we have seen a resurgence of efforts to limit when and where minorities can vote.  The editorial goes on to say, Mr.  Speaker:  ‘‘Voting  discrimination no  longer takes the form of literacy tests  and poll taxes. Instead, it is embodied  in voter-ID laws, the closing of polling  places in minority neighborhoods, the  elimination of early-voting days and  hours, and much more.’’  Mr. Speaker, I hope the House will  take up a bill to restore the Voting  Rights Act without delay and crack  down on these discriminatory practices  that only serve to weaken our democracy by excluding millions of voices  that deserve to be heard.  2015 is the 50-year anniversary of the  passing  and  signing  of  the Voting  Rights Act. That act was achieved only  after some died, many bled, and a large  number participated in the march from  Selma to Montgomery.  That  galvanized American  public  opinion and led the Congress to pass  one of the most significant civil rights  and democratic rights bills of its history. Congress has the responsibility to  act and act now.  As I close, Mr. Speaker, let me remind the Members of the Congress that  I discussed this with the majority leader. The majority leader indicated that  we would have discussions about bringing Voting Rights Act to the floor, as  did I and Mr. Cantor, his predecessor as  majority leader.  I look forward to those discussions to  facilitate and to speed the bringing to  the floor of the bipartisan restoration  of the protections in the Voting Rights  Act amendments.  Mr. Speaker, I will insert into the  RECORDthe editorial reference.

257,House,114,-0.428,8,2015-04-28,Mr. CARSON of Indiana.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1690 names the  U.S. Federal courthouse in Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, for Judge Joseph Weis, a  distinguished jurist who made significant contributions to the surrounding  community.  Judge Weis was a World War II veteran who received the Bronze Star and  the Purple Heart with oak leaf clusters  for his service in the Army. Judge Weis  went on to graduate  from Duquesne  University and the University of Pittsburgh Law School. In 1970, he was appointed to the Western District Court  of Pennsylvania. Three years later, he  was appointed  to  the Third Circuit  Court of Appeals and went on to serve  44 years as a distinguished Federal  judge.  Judge Weis won numerous awards  while  on  the  bench,  including  the  DeVitt Award, considered the highest  award for a Federal judge; the Pitt Distinguished Alumni Award;  and  he  served as an adjunct faculty member at  the Pitt School of Law.  Because of Judge Weis’ dedicated  service to the legal community and his  exemplary time as a jurist in Pittsburgh, it is fitting to name this courthouse in his honor.  I encourage my colleagues to support  this legislation.  ",2015

Families  involved  in  this  underground practice are connecting online  and making dubious or outright illegal  arrangements to give away their children to strangers, often with forged or  fake documentation. Some children are  even transferred to individuals with a  criminal history,  including abuse or  neglect.  Madam Speaker, my legislation provides States with the resources to help  adoptive  families  receive  pre  and  postadoption counseling, social skills  training, and mental health services. It  also expands the training of the Internet  Crimes Against  Children Task  Force to include combating the illegal  transfer of a child.  Madam Speaker, I want to thank my  colleagues who have joined me in cosponsoring this bill, and I encourage  the House to take swift action to protect these vulnerable children.  f  SUPPORT FOR THE PEOPLE OF  NEPAL  (Mr.  CRENSHAW  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

We all have seen the controversy surrounding the discrepancies between the  American  factsheet and  the  Iranian  factsheet. This agreement is too important to rely on secondhand interpretations of the Senate. In order for Congress to adequately evaluate any agreement, we have to see what both sides  believe this agreement is, and that requires the Persian text of the agreement.

262,Senate,114,-0.42,50,2015-04-28,Mr. BLUMENTHAL.," Mr. President, I  thank Senator CARPER and Senator  DURBIN, two of our most distinguished  colleagues who have fought ceaselessly  for the interests of students and veterans. I am very proud to be here with  them today. I do have a very personal  interest as the dad of a veteran and  also of a currently serving young man  whom I hope will be a veteran one day.  Nothing is more important than this  issue of making sure we keep  faith  with our veterans and protect them because  the  phenomena we have  described today often create incentives  for schools to lure veterans into education deals, and they are often education deals that fail them, that don’t  make sense for them, that don’t give  them the education and the qualifications they think they are going to receive. So very often they are failed by  these programs, and they fail to complete  their  courses  and  leave with  mountains of debt but no degree.  These kinds of abuses that bring us  here  today  involve  some  for-profit  schools  in effect scamming our Nation’s veterans.  We all know that for-profit schools  are prohibited  from  receiving more  than 90 percent of their total revenue  from Federal student aid, but, as my  colleagues have so well stated, the Department of Defense and Veterans’ Administration education benefits are not  counted toward that 90 percent. That  loophole causes the for-profits to target  those  servicemembers  and  veterans, often with predatory marketing  practices that  lure them  into those  deals that make no sense for them.  We need to change that law. We need  to change the law so that DOD and VA  benefits count under the 90-percent cap  on Federal revenue. That is really our  ultimate goal.  I thank the President for including  such a provision in his budget request  for fiscal year 2016. I look forward to  working with my colleagues and with  the President in moving that legislative effort forward.  In the meantime, we need a more accurate picture of this problem because  when it comes to for-profit schools and  veterans,  there are  some  things we  definitely need to know and our veterans need to know.  Here is what we do know. We know  there are a large number of for-profit  schools that would be in violation of  the 90–10 rule if we made this change  today. In fact, a 2013 Department of  Education analysis identified 133 for-  profit schools that would be in violation. We also know that the current  loophole  in  that  90–10  rule  creates  those  incentives  for certain  institutions to conduct aggressive, relentless,  often predatory  recruitment of veterans.  What we lack and what we need is  comprehensive, complete  information  on the exact scope of the problem. That  part should be easy. The Department of  Education already collects the information we are asking them to publish.  It is a simple task of publishing how  much revenue schools receive from all  Federal education programs, including  the DOD and the VA. That would bring  accuracy and transparency to the debate over the 90–10 rule. Disclosure and  transparency are part of the battle.  Most  importantly,  this  information  and these statistics would provide veterans themselves and servicemembers  better data and information to make  informed  choices about higher  education.  Let me briefly mention another tool  that I think is very important because  it encourages veterans  to make  informed higher education choices, and  that  is the VA’s GI bill comparison  tool. I am glad—and I thank Secretary  McDonald—the VA has launched this  vitally important resource for veterans  in response to the President’s Executive order, which established principles  of excellence for schools that serve veterans. I also think Secretary McDonald  can take steps to improve this tool,  specifically by adding a risk index that  would highlight unscrupulous bad actors in the industry.  As  our Nation’s  veterans  decide  where to spend their taxpayer-funded  education benefits—their money but  taxpayer funded—they deserve to know  if the school they are considering is  under investigation for deceptive practices, what its record is on this score,  what its graduates do, what the value  is of education and courses there. They  deserve to know if the school they are  considering has been placed on heightened cash monitoring status, a specific  status from the Department of Education. They deserve to have this information. It is vital not only to them but  to their smart use of taxpayer dollars.  Let me finish by saying that for-profit schools have been problematic  in  many ways. The Committee on Health,  Education, Labor  and Pensions,  on  which I served during my first 2 years,  conducted an investigation. I was very  proud to be a part of the effort to reform for-profit schools. Our former colleague Tom Harkin worked very hard  on this issue.  We should not tar every  for-profit  school with  too broad a brush. We  should note improvements that have  been made. This problem is discrete,  identifiable, critically important, and I  thank my colleagues for giving me the  opportunity to talk about it and work  with them on it.  ",2015

It has come down  since, bit by bit. Now it is down by  about two-thirds. But it is still a lot—  like $400 billion or so. That is a lot of  money.

It  is a noble profession, yet  today it remains one of the most dangerous occupations. Building codes and  workplace  safety  regulations  have  made great strides but there is more to  be done. We all share a responsibility  to ensure that men and women who  offer their most valuable asset—their  labor—not only earn  fair wages but  also work in safe environments so they  can  safely  return home after every  shift.  I am proud that in my hometown of  Portland, OR, various public, private  and  nonprofit  stakeholders  have  formed the SafeBuild Alliance to promote and share best practices for worksite safety. This collaboration is so important because we know that with  proper planning, communication and  controls, reducing workplace  injuries  and fatalities is not only possible, it is  already happening.  The SafeBuild Alliance is leading the  way with its Zero Incidents Through  Collaboration initiative, which facilitates safe performance by promoting  the sharing of best practices among industry  professionals.

It is my great privilege to recognize  the Safebuild Alliance for their work  and advocacy for safe workplaces on  behalf of all our workers engaged in  the construction industry.

265,,114,-0.416,78,2015-04-28,Mr. NEAL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce  the Supporting Colorectal Examination  and Education Now (SCREEN) Act of 2015.  This  legislation promotes access  to critical  colorectal screening procedures by removing  barriers to one of the most effective preventive  health screenings available. Simply put, colon  cancer screening tests like colonoscopy save  lives by detecting and preventing cancer, also  reducing costs  for  individuals,  their  families,  the Medicare program, and  the health care  system as a whole.  The likelihood of developing colorectal cancer is greater than one in twenty; meaning that  133,000 Americans will be newly diagnosed  this year. The American Cancer Society (ACS)  estimates that 2,550 new cases of colorectal  cancer will be diagnosed in my home state of  Massachusetts this year and 930 Bay-Staters  will die from this deadly disease. Among all  cancers, colorectal cancer is the number two  killer of Americans. This year alone, approximately  50,000  Americans  will  die  from  colorectal cancer.  Despite these daunting statistics, I am encouraged by the opportunities for improvement  as colorectal cancer is among the most preventable of all cancers. Unlike most other cancer screenings designed to detect cancer at  an early stage, colorectal cancer screenings  can actually prevent cancer from occurring in  the first place. If found early through screening  tests like colonoscopy, pre-cancerous growths  called polyps can be removed, thus halting the  progression to colorectal cancer. Therefore the  way to beat this deadly disease is to ensure  Medicare beneficiaries are screened regularly  through a variety of detection methods, including colonoscopy. In fact, a recent study in the  New England Journal of Medicine concluded  that of the nearly 50,000 people expected to  die of colorectal cancer  this year, screening  colonoscopy could save more than 50 percent  of these deaths.  The  month  of  March  was  ‘National  Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month’ ’ and,  I  think, an appropriate time to reflect on some  of the strides we have made as a nation in  confronting colorectal cancer. While it remains  the second  leading cause of cancer deaths  among men and women combined, both the  incidence and death rate have been steadily  declining  in recent years. This  is a budding  public health success story due  to  improvement  in screening  rates, demonstrating  the  power of preventive medicine. Yet  there  is  much more to accomplish. The federal, state  and local governments, as well as other stakeholders have come together and pledged their  efforts to achieve the goal of 80 percent of eligible Americans screened by 2018.  The screening rate for those in the target  populations has increased nearly 10 percent  over the past decade. In Massachusetts, we  can boast one of the highest screening rates  in the country at 75 percent. However, that still  means that one out of every four eligible people  is  not  getting  screened. Furthermore,  screening rates for recommended tests remain  unacceptably  low across  the country, highlighting the need for public policies to help us  achieve this collaborative national goal of 80  percent screened by 2018.  In particular,  the  Medicare-age  population, which  is  at  the  greatest risk for developing colorectal cancer,  has screening rates far below this goal. CMS  should be commended for implementing policies  to  increase screening utilization  rates.  However, Medicare  beneficiaries make  up  two-thirds of all new cases of colon cancer,  and  the number  is expected  to  increase by  more than 50 percent by 2020.  Accordingly, the SCREEN Act is designed  to enhance Medicare beneficiaries’ ability  to  access colorectal cancer screening by  fixing  coverage gaps and disincentives under  the  benefit. Medicare  currently  covers  certain  colon screening services, but Medicare beneficiaries are not appropriately using this benefit  for various  reasons,  including out-of-pocket  costs and fear of the procedure itself. Medicare  waives  cost-sharing  for  cancer  screenings recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), which assigns  an  ‘A’ ’  rating  for  colorectal  cancer  screening. However, if a doctor finds and removes a pre-cancerous polyp during a screening colonoscopy—the whole point of the procedure in the first place—Medicare no longer  considers it a ‘ ‘screening ’ ’ and the beneficiary  is required to pay co-insurance. The SCREEN  Act waives cost-sharing under  this scenario,  as  well  as  the  necessary  follow-up  colonoscopy upon a positive finding of other  recommended  colorectal  cancer  screening  tests covered by Medicare. These changes  will help achieve  this  ‘80 percent by 2018 ’ ’  goal and will ensure there are no financial barriers  for Medicare beneficiaries across  this  screening continuum in colorectal cancer prevention. Relatedly,  the SCREEN Act would  stabilize Medicare reimbursement for screening tests for the next three years to encourage  Medicare providers to participate in nationally  recognized quality improvement registries and  screening initiatives as we strive towards the  ‘2018 goal.’ ’ This bill would ensure that the  Medicare colorectal cancer screening benefit  works  for both patients and  the physicians  treating Medicare beneficiaries.  Unfortunately,  fear  of  the  screening  colonoscopy test itself undermines the goal of  increasing colorectal cancer screening utilization  rates. This  fear has also undermined  screening rates for another public health epidemic in Medicare, Hepatitis C. Medicare has  concluded that our nation’s veterans and baby  boomers are most at risk for Hepatitis C. Baby  boomers—who make up about 30 percent of  the U.S. population—account for two-thirds of  the people with Hepatitis C in the U.S. CMS  also notes  that roughly 85  to 90 percent of  those  infected with Hepatitis C are asymptomatic, meaning they have no outward signs  of disease. The Centers for Disease Control  (CDC) and USPSTF  recommend age-based  screening for both colorectal cancer and Hepatitis C, even if the Medicare beneficiary has  no  symptoms.  Just  like  colorectal  cancer  screening, we must do more  to  increase  screening for Hepatitis C.  The SCREEN Act  recognizes  the critical  role that doctors play in providing information,  alleviating fears, and encouraging patients to  ask questions, and  thus establishes a demonstration project  to allow Medicare beneficiaries  the  opportunity  to  discuss  these  screening procedures with  the provider performing  the procedure. Thus, allowing  the  Medicare  beneficiary  the  option  to  be  screened for Hepatitis C at the same time the  beneficiary  is  undergoing  a  screening  colonoscopy. One  recent  study  has  demonstrated that more patients will agree to get  a Hepatitis C screening while they are undergoing a screening colonoscopy.  In addition to raising awareness, now is the  time to redouble our commitment to preventing  and beating and preventing colorectal cancer.  I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting the SCREEN Act.  f  HONORING TERRY CLEMENTS  HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 28, 2015  ",2015
266,,114,0.492,85,2015-04-28,Mr. PALAZZO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Sister Mary Jo Mike, named 2015 Principal of the Year by the National Catholic Educational Association.  Sr. Mary Jo, of the Sisters of Saint Francis  of Sylvania, Ohio, has devoted more than 40  years to Catholic education and has led Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral Parish elementary school for the past 23 years,  the longest serving principal in the Catholic Diocese of Biloxi.  Sister Mary Jo soars beyond  the call of  duty, deeply involving herself in the life and  ministry of her parish, school,  local community, and the culture of the Gulf Coast, and encourages others to do the same. From their  daily arrival to their departure, Sr. Mary Jo is  dynamically present  in  the  lives of her students’ school setting. She inspires teachers to  identify and nurture each student’s strengths  and to discover ways to help them overcome  their challenges. Her ministry and leadership  encompasses the healthy development of the  whole student—mind, body, and soul.  True  to her calling, Sister Mary Jo seeks  and claims opportunities  to  improve  life  for  those around her. Under her leadership, Nativity BVM now offers a broad range of programs  for students of any ability, even  including a  Robotics  team and a Lego© club. Clearly  loved and highly respected by all, Sr. Mary Jo  runs a tight ship in an environment of love,  prayerfulness, justice, and peace. She is an  example of always doing one’s best and exceeding expectations  in herself, her  faculty,  her students, and her community, believing  that when children see  their  teachers and  leaders doing their best, they, in turn, are inspired to do their best, too.  I proudly congratulate Sister Mary Jo Mike  as the 2015 NCEA Principal of the Year.  f  IN HONOR OF PETE PASQUALE  HON.

267,,114,-0.237,85,2015-04-28,Mr. RUIZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ms. Eileen Packer on her retirement  after 9 years of service as the founding Chief  Executive Officer of  the Health Assessment  Resource Center (HARC).  During her tenure, Ms. Packer was instrumental in founding HARC and seeking the organization’s nonprofit designation. She designed  the organization’s  triennial needs assessment and was critical  to building strong  support for the organization across the community.  As  a  physician  and  a  native  of  the  Coachella Valley,  I commend Ms. Packer’s  work  to assess  the health and wellness of  Coachella Valley  residents and  improve access to critical health care services. To date,  the data from these surveys has helped generate over $7.1 million  in  funds  for much-  needed programs and services to improve the  wellbeing of residents in our community.  As a Registered Dietitian and Certified Association Executive, Ms. Packer worked in the  Los Angeles area as Director of Food and Nutrition Services at Tarzana Regional Medical  Center. After 11 years there, she led as CEO  of the 7,000-member California Dietetic Association located in Los Angeles.  As a volunteer, Ms. Packer currently serves  on the Riverside County Office on Aging Advisory Council and is a member of the Gilda’s  Club Medical Resource Council. Previously,  she served as President of the Southern California Society of Association Executives.  Mr. Speaker, Eileen’s dedication  to public  service and health education is a true testament to her great work ethic and leadership.  On behalf of all  those who have benefited  from HARC, the medical community and the  residents of California ’s 36th Congressional  District,  I would  like  to offer my sincerest  thanks and congratulate Eileen for her exceptional commitment. I wish her well in her well-  deserved retirement.  f  CONGRATULATING AND HONORING  LONG  LIFE  SOCIAL  ACTIVIST  MARIAN LUPU  HON. RAU´L M.

268,,114,-0.599,85,2015-04-28,Mr. GRIJALVA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate and honor my dear friend Marian  Lupu; a visionary and warrior in the fight for  fairness and social justice. Marian has never  ignored  the plight and needs of others. We  celebrate her 90th birthday and relish in her  work. I want to submit a profile of Ms. Marian  Lupu  that appeared  in  the Arizona Jewish  Post, written by Shelia Wilenskey; this, better  than I, describes a life worth honor.  Marian Lupu, now 89, founded the Pima  Council on Aging in 1965. She didn’t retire as  executive director until 2006, when she was  82. ‘‘If you love what you’re doing, why not?’’  Lupu asked the AJP. A pioneer in her field,  Lupu took one of the  first courses ever  taught on aging when she was a graduate  student at the University of Chicago. ‘‘I soon  decided,’’ she says, ‘‘that all the research in  the world wasn’t going to help the aging population unless it provided services and advocacy.’’  In her elder years, Lupu practices what she  preached. ‘‘The biggest thing I’ve learned is  to use the supports I have,’’ she says. ‘‘I take  all the support I can get, use a walker or a  cane, without having the resistance of many  older people who drive and get into accidents  or who fall down because they want to be  independent.’’  Lupu started her career as a student working at the National Opinion Research Center  at the University of Chicago and later supervised the first study on aging Spanish-American War veterans. Her 1948 marriage to  Charles Lupu, Ph.D., eventually brought the  couple to Tucson in 1965, when he landed a  job at the Tucson Medical Center. She started the Tucson Council on Aging as a volunteer. The agency  later became the Pima  Council on Aging.  ‘‘I recognized there were no services for the  aging population here, whether they were  Jewish or not. I learned a great deal,’’ says  Lupu, from Betty Brook, who was instrumental, with her husband, in helping to build  Tucson’s Jewish community, including Jewish Family & Children’s Services and Dr. Ted  Koff, the first director of Handmaker Jewish  Services for the Aging.  ‘‘Family counseling is very much a concern to the Jewish community,’’ says Lupu,  who grew up in ‘‘a very Orthodox family, and  in a very kosher environment in Elmwood  Park, Ill, a suburb of Chicago. Our Shabbos  goy was our next-door neighbor. It was a  very Italian neighborhood. In order to have  services on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur  we brought  in a  rabbinical  student and  rented a storefront.’’  Back in 1929, she recalls, ‘‘there was no  telephone in the shul so a messenger would  come get the Jewish doctor for an emergency. We had to wait till he returned for a  minyan.’’  VerDate Sep 11 2014  04:24 Apr 29, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A28AP8.026 E28APPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w D O R P 1 N V T P S 4 K S D n o r e c n e p S S         ",2015

270,House,114,0.611,11,2015-05-14,Mr. GOSAR.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to draw attention to the serious  issue facing my home State of Arizona.  For several years, I have been actively involved in a troubling off-reservation gaming  issue  in my home  State of Arizona involving the Tohono  O’odham Nation. The tribe has been attempting to move from their ancestral  lands in Tucson into another tribe’s  former reservation in the Phoenix metropolitan area for the sole purpose of  building a Las Vegas-style casino.  Tohono’s dismissal of their promise  of a voter-approved compact and their  dismissal of a promise to build no additional casinos in Phoenix is not something that Congress can ignore when  the result will be so harmful to what  has been a national model.  Furthermore,  Tohono  has  falsely  been claiming a victory in court. This  sentiment  is  factually wrong. The  Tohono won nothing based on the merits. Rather, the case was dismissed on  the draconian doctrine of sovereign immunity, which we, Congress, have jurisdiction and oversight of, rather than  the courts.  I urge  immediate adoption of this  commonsense  legislation  that  has  passed this same body last Congress  and has already passed committee by  unanimous consent.  f  EXPORT-IMPORT BANK  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

If we don’t do  it now,  it  is about kicking the can  down the road once again.  It is because of this dysfunction that  we have here in Congress that we can’t  get something done. People talk to us  day in and day out about how disgusted  they are. We can’t do things. They are  crying out for predictability.  If you were only going to get two  paychecks, would  you  be  thinking  about buying a house? Of course not.  Industries that rely on our roads and  bridges  to move goods and  services  need that predictability, that funding,  to make good business decisions. Otherwise, it would be foolish for them to  do that.  We all say we want to help our economy grow, and certainly I do. Let’s  give the job creators a reason to create  jobs. Let’s  reauthorize  the highway  trust fund for the long term.  f  b1230  WHEN WOMEN SUCCEED, AMERICA  SUCCEEDS: AN ECONOMIC AGENDA FOR WOMEN AND FAMILIES  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)

274,House,114,-0.402,18,2015-05-14,Mr. DOGGETT.," Mr. Speaker, there is  probably no more critical issue on our  national agenda today than this matter with  Iran.  151 Members of  the  House have joined together to encourage the President to  ‘‘exhaust every  avenue  toward a verifiable, enforceable, diplomatic solution in order to  prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.’’  Mr. Speaker, I would ask unanimous  consent to insert in the RECORD this  communication.  CONGRESSOFTHEUNITEDSTATES,  Washington DC, May 7, 2015.  The PRESIDENT,  The White House,  Washington, DC.  DEARMR. PRESIDENT: As negotiations over  Iran’s nuclear program continue, we urge  you to stay on course, building on the recently announced political framework and  continuing to work toward a strong and  verifiable agreement between the P5+1 countries and Iran that will prevent Iran from  having a nuclear weapon. We commend you  and your negotiating team, as well as our coalition partners, for the significant progress  made thus far.  This issue is above politics. The stakes are  too great, and the alternatives are too dire.  We must exhaust every avenue toward a  verifiable, enforceable, diplomatic solution  in order to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. If  the United States were to abandon negotiations or cause their collapse, not only would  we  fail  to peacefully prevent a nuclear-  armed Iran, we would make that outcome  more likely. The multilateral sanctions regime that brought Iran to the table would  likely  collapse,  and  the  Iranian  regime  would likely decide to accelerate its nuclear  program,  unrestricted  and  unmonitored.  Such developments could lead us to war.  War itself will not make us safe. A U.S. or  Israeli military strike may set back Iranian  nuclear development by two or three years  at best—a  significantly  shorter  timespan  than  that covered by a P5+1 negotiated  agreement. We must  pursue  diplomatic  means to their fullest and allow the negotiations to run their course—especially now  that the parties have announced a strong  framework—and continue working to craft a  robust and verifiable Joint Comprehensive  Plan of Action by June 30.  We must allow our negotiating team the  space and time necessary to build on the  progress made  in the political  framework  and  turn  it  into a  long-term, verifiable  agreement. If we do not succeed, Congress  will remain at-the-ready to act and present  you with additional options to ensure that  Iran is prevented from acquiring a nuclear  weapon.  Thank you for your resolve in preventing a  nuclear-armed Iran. We look forward to continuing our shared work on this important  matter.  Sincerely,  JANSCHAKOWSKY,  Member of Congress.

275,House,114,0.601,32,2015-05-14,Mr. BROOKS of Alabama.," Madam  Speaker, the NDAA, as amended by  Congressman RUBENGALLEGO, undermines America’s border security and  ratifies parts of Obama’s illegal amnesty for illegal aliens.  During the early morning, sleep-deprived portion of the Armed Services  Committee NDAA hearing, the Gallego  amendment, which encourages the Secretary of Defense to take military service opportunities from Americans and  from  lawful  immigrants  in order to  give them to illegal aliens, passed on a  close 33–30 vote. As Members ponder  my amendment to strike the Gallego  amendment, we should consider how  much American families are struggling  in an anemic job and wage market and  how much  the Gallego  amendment  makes  job and  income prospects  for  Americans even worse.  From 2000 to 2014—and although the  American economy gained 5.6 million  jobs in the 16 to 65 age bracket—American-born citizens suffered a net loss of  127,000 jobs. These job losses, combined  with population growth, mean  that  there were  17 million more  jobless  American-born  citizens  than  there  were 14 years earlier. Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Caucasian  Americans—American  men  and  women—all  lost  economic  ground.  While American-born citizens suffered  economic  hardship,  job  losses,  and  wage suppression, foreign-born persons  gained 5.7 million jobs.  In the context of this anemic economy, GALLEGO’s amendment to take  military service jobs from Americans  and from lawful immigrants in order to  give  them  to  illegal aliens  is outrageous and unconscionable. I encourage Members to represent the interests  of Americans and lawful immigrants by  voting to strike the Gallego amendment from the NDAA.  ",2015

280,House,114,0.559,200,2015-05-14,Mr. SCALISE.," I thank the gentleman  from Texas for yielding the time.  Mr. Chairman, I want to present an  amendment that is bipartisan and that  deals with AbilityOne agencies.  The Department of Defense has created three procurement programs for  Afghanistan, central Asian states, and  Djibouti  to  support  businesses  and  local economies in these countries and  to cultivate positive relationships in  the region and the world. The problem  is, while I surely appreciate their intentions, there have been unintended  consequences with this program in implementing these programs.  The GSA has allowed businesses located in these countries to supply products manufactured by AbilityOne agencies, which employ blind and disabled  Americans. The result of that policy  has been devastating to many of these  AbilityOne agencies across the country. We have seen job losses here in  America in implementing this new policy by the Department of Defense.  This amendment addresses the problem of these job losses by exempting  those AbilityOne agencies  from this  Department of Defense procurement  program. If you look at what has happened with this program, we have seen  facilities not only in Louisiana but in  States  like New York, Texas, Ohio,  Kansas, North Carolina, Nebraska, and  Washington all experience  job  losses  here in America from shipping those  jobs over to foreign countries.  Again,  I think—or  I surely would  hope—that that was not the intention  of the program, Mr. Chairman, to take  jobs away from disabled Americans and  ship those jobs overseas.  b1645  So what this amendment does is restore those jobs back here in America  for  those  blind  and  other  disabled  Americans who have one of the highest  underemployment populations  in the  country. Let’s keep those jobs here. We  can continue building relations with  other countries, but just not at the expense of American  jobs  for disabled  workers. That is what the amendment  does.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield  to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  BOUSTANY), who is a cosponsor.  ",2015
281,House,114,-0.283,207,2015-05-14,Mr. SMITH of Washington.," Mr.  Chairman, I yield myself 21⁄2minutes.  Mr.  Chairman,  this  amendment  would take out of the bill all of the  things that are in it that make it impossible to close Guantanamo Bay prison.  This is a debate we have had many  times. The provisions are  typically  banning any transfers to the U.S., banning any construction in the U.S. of  any facilities to house the folks being  housed right now at Guantanamo. It  strips out those two, and it also asks  the President to give us a detailed plan  on how he would go about closing  Guantanamo and what he would do  with the inmates that are there now,  and it requires a 90-day notice period  to Congress before any action could be  taken on that. And it is basically the  same argument that I just made as to  why we should close Guantanamo.  It was opened in the first place as a  way to try to get around the U.S. Constitution. Basically, the thought was,  since it wasn’t in the continental U.S.,  habeas corpus and other constitutional  protections wouldn’t apply. But  the  Supreme Court a number of years ago  said that it is effectively under U.S.  control, so all the same rules apply.  One  argument  that  is  frequently  trotted out is that somehow, if they  were brought to the U.S., they would  suddenly  have  constitutional  rights  that they don’t have in Guantanamo.  The Supreme Court has already ruled  on that. They have ruled that it is effectively under U.S. control, and they  have the exact same rights to habeas  corpus and all other  rights  that a  criminal or a law of war prisoner would  have. So if we brought them to the  U.S., it would not be a problem.  My two basic arguments are, number  one, we have an alternative to Guantanamo. It is not like there is no option.  There are now, I believe, 122 inmates—  I forget the exact number—who have  been cleared for transfer back to another country. But  it  is somewhere  roughly half of that amount, we would  be looking at between 50 and 60 inmates that would need to be transferred to the U.S. And we have the facilities here. As  I  said, we already  house some of the most dangerous terrorists we have ever arrested and convicted. We have the facilities. We have  the ability to hold them safely here. So  there is an alternative.  The  current  situation  in Guantanamo Bay has a number of negatives.  The high cost, as I have mentioned several times, almost $3 million an  inmate; and then the international eyesore that Guantanamo Bay is—not just  to the terrorists. I don’t care about  them. I don’t care what they say, how  they feel about us holding people at  Guantanamo. But to our allies in Europe, to people in the Arab world who  want to help us defeat the scourge of  Islamic extremism, this  is an  international eyesore that we should close,  and we should make the transfers as  soon as we possibly can. This amendment makes that possible.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2015

I have no doubt that closing GTMO  and releasing or transferring terrorists  who have committed to killing American citizens jeopardizes both the safety and security of the United States  and our citizens abroad.  If the success or failure of the mission at GTMO is based on the number  of attacks against the United States  after 9/11, I am confident everyone in  this room would join me in judging the  mission  has  been  successful.  Intelligence collection and national security have been strengthened as a result  of GTMO, and America remains a safer  place thanks to the men and women  serving there.

284,House,114,0.406,242,2015-05-14,Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina.,"  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  Chairman  THORNBERRY and the committee staff  for continuing to work with me on  issues facing Fort Bragg, including the  deactivation of the 440th Airlift Wing.  My amendment is simple. I am demanding accountability for what I believe to be a terribly misguided and  shortsighted decision. The airborne and  special operations units the 440th supports are unique because  there are  paratroopers within  the Global Response Force who are on call  24/7,  packed and ready to deploy anywhere  in the world within hours. It is safe to  say that the level of readiness required  for these forces is unparalleled.  In the midst of global uncertainty,  the idea of deactivating such a vital  element is simply baffling to me. I see  this as dangerous to our paratroopers,  and I demand accountability for this  ill-advised decision. As the Representative of Fort Bragg, I will not stand idly  by when I see a decision that negatively  impacts  the  brave men  and  women serving our country.  ",2015

CAROLYN B. MALONEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 14, 2015  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York.  Mr. Speaker,  it has been  forty-three years  since Congress  passed  the Equal Rights  Amendment  (also  known as  the Women’s  Equality Amendment). This historic amendment  is  intended  to enshrine  in our United  States  Constitution  fundamental  equality  based on sex in all areas of society.  In 1972, Congress passed the ERA with a  measure that it had to be ratified by the necessary number of states (38) within 7 years.  The deadline was ultimately extended an additional three years, but with this narrow and arbitrary time limit, the ERA fell just three states  shy  of  full  ratification when  the  deadline  passed.  Other  constitutional  amendments  have been afforded much longer for ratification. One example  is  the 27th amendment,  concerning Congressional pay  raises, which  was accepted after a 203-year ratification period.  This Congress, I am joined by my colleague  Representative CYNTHIALUMMIS in this important bipartisan effort to finally add women to  the Constitution. It is time for our nation to definitively declare that we will not tolerate discrimination against half the population. While  we have made cracks  in  the glass ceiling  throughout history, we have yet to shatter it.  We believe that this amendment is far more  than a symbolic demonstration of equality, but  rather would provide protections that are vital  to the wellbeing and prosperity of women and  their families.  The ERA will ensure all citizens have the  opportunity to reach their full potential. Women  and men must have equal rights for a democracy to thrive.  The ERA will put women on equal footing in  the legal systems of all 50 states, particularly  in areas where women have historically been  treated as second-class citizens, including in  cases of public education, divorce, child custody, domestic violence, and sexual assault.  Passing the ERA will put the full weight of  the U.S. Constitution behind employment laws  relating to the prevention of sex discrimination  in hiring, firing, promotions, and benefits—especially in the public sector.  Pregnancy discrimination continues  to be  prevalent in the workforce. The ERA can protect women  from being harmed by a policy  simply because she is a woman.  The 14th amendment is not enough. Only  the ERA would provide for gender equity and  offer an ‘ ‘overriding guarantee’ ’ of equal protection for women.  The ERA would protect the progress made  on women ’s rights  from any shifting political  trends.  The ERA will ensure that the rights of American women and girls will not be diminished by  any Congress or any political  trend, but  instead be preserved as basic rights guaranteed  by the U.S. Constitution.  Over  the past several decades,  legislative  efforts have aimed  to advance  the rights of  women—but this progress is not irreversible.  Without the ERA, women have often been denied the ability to seek justice when they have  experienced discrimination. We have seen that  constitutional ambiguity on women ’s rights can  have negative consequences when cases that  affect the lives of women are brought before  the Supreme Court. Until women’s equality is  clearly acknowledged in our Constitution, half  of our population will continue to be without  constitutionally guaranteed equality. The time  is now to make women’s equality a constitutional reality.  Our democracy rests on the principle of ‘ ‘liberty and justice for all.’ ’ We need the ERA to  ensure that this concept applies equally to all.  I am pleased to introduce this bill with 171  of my bipartisan colleagues. I urge my fellow  Members of Congress to join in support.  OFFICER BENJAMIN DEEN  HON. STEVEN M.

288,Senate,114,0.403,45,2015-05-22,Mr. ISAKSON.," Mr. President,  responding through the Chair to the Senator from Kansas, his language is precisely the  language that was  introduced by the committee in the Senate,  which we were going to send to the  House, but it got lost in the negotiations on the extension of the authorization  in the House. A technical difficulty is the only reason it wasn’t already a part of it.  I wholeheartedly endorse everything  the Senator  from Kansas  said  and  pledge to him that if for some reason  the House does not adopt the language,  we will take it up immediately in the  Senate when we have our next markup  meeting in the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and take care of it.  I personally wish  to acknowledge  Senator BENNETand Senator GARDNER  for all the work they have done. We  went to Colorado together to visit the  VA hospital, which is the genesis of  where this motion comes from. They  have been champions for this, and I am  glad we are reaching a resolution in  the motion that will be made shortly  to adopt the House position on the authorization. We will see to it that the  hospital in Denver remains open until  we can solve the problems we have in  the Denver hospital.  I thank the Senator from Kansas for  his cooperation, and I commend him on  his language. I confirm everything he  said as being accurate, true, and correct.  ",2015
289,,114,0.382,52,2015-05-22,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, soon the  Senate will vote on final passage of the  Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015. This is a historic piece  of legislation that will renew trade promotion authority.  As I have already said here on the  floor many times, this bill has been a  long time coming. I personally have  been  focused on this  for the  last 4  years, but I know that for those whose  lives and  livelihoods revolve around  American  trade,  the wait has been  much longer.  This is an important bill, no doubt  about it, and likely the most important bill we will pass this year. It is  important to President Obama, and I  know it is important to many of us  here in this Chamber. It shows that  when the President is right, we will  support him.  From the beginning, TPA has been a  bipartisan effort. Despite the difficulties we have faced here on the floor, I  am glad  it has  remained  that way  throughout the process.  I am very appreciative of all those  who have put in so much time and effort to get the bill to this point.  Going back to last year, I want to  thank the former chairmen, Max Baucus and Dave Camp, who helped get the  ball rolling on this TPA bill.  I would especially like to thank the  staff, who put in a great deal of time  on the initial draft of this legislation,  including Amber Cottel, former staff  director of the Senate Committee on  Finance; Bruce Hirsh,  former  chief  trade counsel; and international trade  counsel Lisa Pearlman.  I want thank my colleagues on the  Committee on Finance, whose  input  and  support has  been  instrumental  both in drafting and developing this  legislation as well as helping it move  forward. Most notably,  I  thank  the  ranking member on the Committee on  Finance, the coauthor of this current  legislation, Senator RONWYDEN. His  commitment to his principles and constituents has been admirable. Although  it has taken a lot of time for the two of  us to get to this point, his efforts have  undoubtedly improved the substance of  the bill and helped broaden its support.  I very much appreciate the efforts of  Senator WYDEN in the drafting the bill  and getting it through the committee  and here on the floor.  There are other Senators who played  key roles in getting us to where we are.  I want to thank our distinguished majority leader and the majority whip. I  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD—SENATE May 22, 2015  also thank Senators CARPERand MURRAY.  Obviously, every Senator who has  voted and worked to get us to this  point deserves thanks. I will thank you  all individually as the clerk calls the  roll for this last vote.  Of course, I want to thank my staff  on the Committee on Finance, who  worked long hours for many months to  get us here, and Senator WYDEN’s staff  as well. On the Republican side, I particularly  want  to  thank  Everett  Eissenstat for leading the way, and his  family,  Janet,  Alex,  and  Jacob  Eissenstat, for lending him to us for so  many hours. I want to thank the rest  of the Republican trade staff: Shane  Warren, Rebecca Eubank, Karen Rosenbaum, Sahra Su, Andrew Rollo, and  Kenneth Schmidt. I also want to thank  my senior team: Chris Campbell, Mark  Prater, Jay Khosla, Jeff Wrase, and  Bryan Hickman. And of course I need  to thank our communications team:  Julia Lawless, Aaron Forbes, Amelia  Breinig, and Joshua Blume.  On the Democratic side of the committee staff,  I want to thank Josh  Sheinkman,  Jocelyn  Moore,  Mike  Evans, Jayme White, and Elissa Alben  for all their hard work, and others as  well who worked on that side.  I also thank the Senate Republican  leadership staff, who put a lot of blood,  sweat, and tears  into this endeavor.  From their staffs, I need to particularly thank Sharon Soderstrom, Hazen  Marshall, Brendan Dunn, Terry Van  Doren, Erica Suares, Antonio Ferrier,  Russ Thomasson, and Johnny Slemrod.  From the Republican cloakroom staff,  I want to single out the efforts of  Laura Dove, Robert Duncan and Megan  Mercer.  Of course, we need to mention the efforts of our attorneys at the legislative  counsel’s office, particularly Margaret  Roth Warren and Thomas Haywood,  who did a lot of heavy lifting in putting together the bill and the amendments.  The  Parliamentarian’s  office  has  been immensely helpful as well. From  their staff, I would like to thank Elizabeth McDonough, Leigh Hildebrand,  Thomas Cuffie, and Michael Beaver.  Throughout this process, we received  assistance  from  the United  States  Trade Representative. I thank Ambassador Froman and his staff for all their  assistance in this effort.  Really, the list of people I need to  thank is too long to cover in a single  floor speech. I just hope it is clear to  everyone on both sides of the floor who  worked on this bill  just how appreciative I am.  As far as the Senate is concerned, we  have one more vote to go on this bill,  but that is not the end for the bill. I  am committed to working with my colleagues in the House and with the administration to get this bill across the  finish line. As I said earlier this week,  for me, the work on TPA doesn’t finish  until we have a bill on the President’s  desk.  I look forward to continuing this particular effort and to working with my  colleagues  on  whatever  challenge  comes next.  With that, Mr. President, I yield the  floor.  ",2015
290,,114,-0.318,52,2015-05-22,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, I will be  brief.  It would be an understatement to say  there have been strong differences of  opinion here in this Chamber and in  our country with respect to this legislation. I have said from the very beginning that opponents of this effort—  trade  promotion  authority—have  a  number of very valid points.  There is no question in my mind, colleagues, that there has been way too  much secrecy in the past, so Senator  HATCHand I set out to make some very  significant changes in that. Now, starting with the TPP but with all other  agreements, the American people will  have that agreement in their hands for  close to 4 months before anybody votes  here in the Senate or in the House on  TPP or a trade agreement. I think that  is a step toward a sunshine trade policy.  Second,  I  thought opponents were  spot-on with respect to their comments  that we needed a completely new regime with  respect  to enforcing our  trade laws. Again and again the American people say: What are you talking  about in terms of passing a new trade  deal if you aren’t doing a better job of  enforcing the laws on the books? So we  set about to put in place a tough enforce act to go after cheats. We had  Senator BROWN’s leveling the playing  field, which I think is a very important  piece of legislation, and an early warning system so that for the first time,  rather than waiting until it is too late,  businesses and labor unions and others  would see what is coming. I think that  is a significant step forward.  Many skeptics said there isn’t an aggressive approach to protect labor and  the environment.  It essentially gets  shunted to the side. Now we have enforceable standards in this area.  Because of the good work of Senator  for the  first time, colleagues, human rights will be a significant factor in trade legislation.  Finally, we put in place a new process  so  that  this body can put  the  brakes on a bad deal. We have always  talked about  fast-track because we  want people to have an opportunity to  consider a new agreement. We also  ought to put the brakes on a bad deal.  I will close with this point: At the  end of the day, colleagues, we have always known that one of the paths to  more good-paying jobs in our country  is exports. There are going to be 1 billion middle-class people—1 billion—in  the developing world in 2025. These will  be people with money, colleagues. They  are going to buy our wine, our computers, our helicopters, our planes, and  all kinds of goods and services with the  American brand.

Bradley, two constituents born and raised in  my district, who will be celebrating their 60th  wedding anniversary on June 18, 2015.  Michael Bradley was born and  raised  in  Philadelphia and is a graduate of St. Thomas  More High School. His loving wife, Bernadette  Ann Sherry, was also born and raised in Philadelphia and graduated  from West Catholic  High School. The Bradleys are an extremely  close knit  Irish Catholic  family, blessed with  eight children and twenty-three grandchildren.  Mr. & Mrs. Bradley taught their children that  the best way out of poverty was through hard  work and education. Fortunately, Michael and  Bernadette were able to support all eight of  their children as they attended college. Above  all,  the Bradleys always gave  their children  three major items to live by: ‘ ‘Faith, Family &  Friends’ ’.  Mr. & Mrs. Bradley are not only prosperous  with love from their large family, but have also  succeeded  in  the business realm. The M.J.  Bradley Company was founded in 1973, and  continues to be a well known contender in the  construction  industry,  installing quality  floor  and wall products. The M.J. Bradley Co. continues to grow and thrive under the guidance  of five of the Bradley’s children.  I would  like my colleagues  to  join me  in  honoring the significance of this occasion, as  Mr. & Mrs. Bradley celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary. They are both model citizens  of Philadelphia and will remain an inspiration  to their family and community for generations  to come.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE  2015 ELLIS  ISLAND MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS  HON.

And I just want to take a moment to  recognize the chairman, the ranking  member, the subcommittee chairman  and ranking member, for their work on  this critical legislation.  South Florida, where I hail from, is  home to thousands of Haitian Americans, and I know that they will soon be  expressing  their  gratitude  to  this  House, to this Congress,  for passing  this important bipartisan legislation.  This legislation is going to provide  opportunity, hope for the people of the  continent of Africa, but also for the  people of Haiti. And in south Florida,  we have a very special bond with Haiti.  We know how much that country needs  American involvement, opportunity.  And the relatives of so many Haitians who live in south Florida will be  beaming with pride and gratitude when  they get the news that this House has  passed this critical legislation.  As Chairman RYAN says, this is not  just trade legislation. This is foreign  policy. This is foreign aid, but the aid  that really helps people prosper, the  aid  that  allows  companies,  governments to provide opportunity for their  citizens.  This will also provide opportunity for  our citizens. The more markets that we  help create for our products, American  businesses and American families will  thrive.  For a long time, people have been  complaining that the economic recovery has been weak; that it has left the  people at the bottom behind. This is  our opportunity to change that, to create more markets  for American exports, to give people hope and opportunity, so that the United States can  continue  being  that  country, Mr.  Speaker, where anyone who comes and  wants to succeed and wants to work  hard will have that opportunity. This  is how we do it, and we also do it by  working together.  All of us  in  this House want  to  strengthen Medicare,  and  today we  have taken another important step toward strengthening Medicare. How? By  working together. This is exactly what  the American people sent us here to do.

327,,114,-0.223,144,2015-06-11,Mr. FOSTER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize  the Quad County Urban League  and the students participating in two of its important  programs:  Tomorrow’s  Scientists,  Technicians,  and Managers,  and  Project  Ready.  For over  twenty years,  the Quad County  Urban League has sponsored Tomorrow’s Scientists, Technicians, and Managers in an effort to inspire young minority students to pursue  their goals. Over 1,800 students have  benefited from the tutoring, workshops, college  visits, and guest speakers provided by  the  program. Students who have completed  the  program maintain excellent grade point averages, receive thousands of dollars in scholarships, and contribute countless hours giving  back to their community.  More  recently,  the Quad County Urban  League has introduced Project Ready, a program with the goal of familiarizing minority students and their families with the college decision making process. By introducing concepts  like college admissions and financial aid early  on, Project Ready prepares a path for strong  academic students to pursue post-secondary  STEM Education.  Congratulations to the Quad County Urban  League and  the students who have participated  in  these  rigorous programs. Real differences are being made in our communities  because of programs  like Tomorrow’s Scientists,  Technicians,  and Managers,  and  Project Ready.  f  RECOGNIZING THE PUERTO RICAN  FAMILY INSTITUTE  HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 11, 2015  Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay  tribute to an organization that has evolved into  an  important anchor  in both New York City  and in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican Family  Institute (PRFI) provides a wide range of critical social and health services, strengthening  our neighborhoods.  For some of our youngest neighbors, PRFI  operates 35 Head Start centers  located  in  Brooklyn,  the Bronx and San Juan, Puerto  Rico. 1,396 children benefit from this initiative,  which provides pre-school children of low-income families a comprehensive child development program to meet their educational, emotional, social, health and nutritional needs. In  addition,  the  Institute operates  four  full-day  Universal Pre-K classrooms serving over 60  children in Brooklyn and the Bronx.  On the other end of the age spectrum, PRFI  is equally committed to caring for the seniors  in our community. The Life Line Center  for  Latino Seniors is based at the Brooklyn Mental  Health Clinic, and offers seniors counseling,  assistance with  obtaining  financial  entitlements,  referrals  for medical services,  food  stamp assistance, as well as group and peer  support.  Mental health  services are also part of  PRFI’s portfolio. The Children’s Intensive Case  Management Program  targets assistance  to  emotionally disturbed children in need of clinical case management and supervision. In addition PRFI runs a center helping emotionally  disturbed adolescents, and provides adult supportive services to homeless mentally ill individuals. 1,128 clients benefit from this service,  making it the largest in our state.  Housing assistance is made available to developmentally  disabled  individuals  through  PRFI’s quality community based  residential  services, which aims to provide skills that will  enable program beneficiaries to live as independently as possible.  Mr. Speaker,  I could go on. From health  services, to nutritional programs, PRFI helps  meet the needs of ten thousand families and  children  residing  in New York and Puerto  Rico. The assistance offered extends well beyond  the Latino community reaching  individuals of all backgrounds. What all of PRFI’s  programs have in common is that they provide  a helping hand to some of our most vulnerable  neighbors. Whether  it  is  the senior citizen  struggling to get by on a fixed income, a low-  income family endeavoring to raise children or  a developmentally disabled person wanting to  lead  a  richer  life,  PRFI  harnesses  the  strengths of our community to assist them.  f  BULK DATA COLLECTION  TRAMPLES OUR RIGHTS  HON. TED POE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  the aufirst obThursday, June 11, 2015  ",2015
328,,114,0.593,144,2015-06-11,Mr. POE of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, the unrestricted and unconstitutional bulk data collection program started by  the NSA represents  the worst of the Washington Machine.  A recent poll shows that a majority of Americans agree.  The government should not have  thority  to collect  information without  taining a warrant. Period.  Our Founders feared a government powerful  enough to commit unreasonable searches and  seizures, so they crafted the Fourth Amendment to protect our right to privacy.  Though  technology has evolved and continues to do so, the Constitution remains the  same.  Gone are  the days where Americans use  their cellphones exclusively  for phone calls  and text messages.  Many people also use their phones for daily  activities from tracking their steps to logging  their finances or inputting what they ate that  day.  The Fourth Amendment protects our phone  conversations, our emails, our texts, our Internet history, our bank statements and more.  The NSA bulk-collection program  tramples  our rights.  Recently,  the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals  deemed this bulk collection of data illegal.  Now, some members of Congress are trying  to pass a law that allows this illegal surveillance to continue, and I will not stand for it.  The House  of Representatives  recently  passed the USA Freedom Act, which makes  some steps to limit data collection under Section 215 of the Patriot Act; however, the bill  does nothing to limit government spying under  Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act.  Contrary to claims that the House bill would  ‘end bulk surveillance,’ ’ the truth is it would  not.  The NSA uses Section 702 as a means to  gather not only data, but actual content of  communications—content of your phone calls,  texts and emails. Section 702 is more intrusive  than Section 215.  In the course of this collection, the content  of American citizens, many of whom have  done nothing wrong or  illegal,  is also collected.  Current law allows law enforcement to then  search through this data for information and  they can do so without a warrant.

329,,114,-0.329,3,2015-06-19,Mr. KEATING.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the twentieth anniversary of the Coalition for Social Justice (CSJ) based in Southeastern Massachusetts.  For twenty years, the CSJ has been dedicated  to  the praiseworthy goal of building a  grassroots movement  for progressive social  change,  rooted  in  low-income  communities  and communities of color that have been excluded from the economic benefits of the current system.  The CSJ has a dual focus: to recruit and  develop  its own  leaders  from  low  income  backgrounds; and to organize effective campaigns  to  address  the  economic  survival  issues that low-income communities and communities of color face. CSJ’s agenda includes:  funding essential community services through  progressive  taxes, worker’s  rights, housing,  health care, education, welfare, criminal justice  reform,  immigrant  rights, and environmental  justice.  CSJ has actively participated in advocating  for  the needs of working-class  families. For  example, in 2014 CSJ helped increase minimum wage  in Massachusetts,  and  also  helped earn sick time for all workers in Massachusetts. In 2011, CSJ helped to restore the  children’s clothing allowance of $150 per year  per child so children were able  to start  the  school year with suitable clothing. These examples  represent only a  small  fraction of  CSJ’s commendable work.  Mr. Speaker, please  join me  in congratulating the CSJ on its twentieth year anniversary. It gives me great pride to recognize them  for all of the admirable work they do for those  in need.  f  ON  THE  TRADE  FACILITATION  AND TRADE ENFORCEMENT ACT  OF 2015  HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.

This bill is notable for what it funds  and what it doesn’t fund.  West Virginians, we love our clean  water. We love clean air. We love our  mountains and our forests and our rivers.  What West Virginians do not love is  this President’s war  on  coal. This  week, petitions from 26,000 West Virginians were delivered to my office  asking the President to stop the war on  coal. West Virginia’s jobs and our citizens’ livelihoods are on the line. The  President has requested hundreds of  millions of dollars to spend on new regulations, programs, and an army of  lawyers to defend his illegal regulatory  overreach.  Our State has lost 7,000 coal jobs in  just the last 3 years of this administration. Today, we say ‘‘no’’ to funding  the war on coal,  ‘‘no’’ to regulatory  overreach. We do cut the EPA’s budget  by more than $1 billion from what was  requested. We halt harmful, job-killing  rules on new and existing coal-fired  power plants.  We say no to changing the definition  of navigable waters and fill material,  no to imposing ozone regulations that  are simply unachievable, and no to imposing the stream buffer zone rule.  The Administrator of the EPA even  refused to come to West Virginia to  talk  to our communities and hard-  working coal miners, but instead, when  she refused, I brought coal miners to  the Appropriations Committee to tell  their  story, and  it was a powerful  story.  Today, I am here with 26,000 other  voices to make sure they are heard  here at the Capitol.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your  leadership. Thank you  for  the hard  work.  I would appreciate a ‘‘yes’’ vote on  this important legislation  ",2015
337,House,114,-0.306,73,2015-06-25,Mr. KILMER.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to begin by thanking the subcommittee  chairman, my friend from California,  and the ranking member, my  friend  from Minnesota, for the hard work that  they have put into today’s bill.  As a new member of the committee,  I have gotten to see firsthand the enormous amount of work that went into  the product that we have before us  today, and it is, frankly, a testament  to the hard work of the Appropriations  Committee staff that we have been able  to get to this point.  I want to begin by expressing support  for a number of really important provisions in the bill that I think are critical points of progress. In a very tough  budget environment, this bill boosts  funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service, increasing the Federal commitment to  addressing the needs of Indian Country.  Coming from timber country, I can  say that there is also a very strong effort here to ensure that the Forest  Service can responsibly increase harvest levels on our national forests, as  well as supporting new tools, such as  collaboratives, that have the potential  to bring folks together in a way that  reduces the litigation risk surrounding  these projects.  Of course, I would love for us to be  able include in this bill Mr. SIMPSON’s  legislation addressing wildfire disaster  funding. I have heard from so many  people in my neck of the woods just  how important it is that we get this  taken care of it.  The bill also provides essential resources to support recovery efforts in  the Puget Sound. As both the chairman  and  ranking member  of  the  subcommittee know, this is big deal, both  for our natural environment and for  our economy; and I will continue working with them to make sure we are  dedicating  the needed  resources  for  this critical effort.  Unfortunately, I will have to oppose  the bill before us today. This bill comes  in at $2 billion below the President’s  budget request. It would cut funding  for the Land and Water Conservation  Fund. It fails to make needed investments  in the National Park System  and takes a meat axe to the Environmental Protection Agency and the programs that protect clean water.  Mr. Chairman, to conclude, let me  just say we need to come together in a  bipartisan way to end sequestration, to  remove these budget caps, and to work  on bipartisan bills that make the investments our Nation needs to boost  economic development and protect our  natural  resources  for  future generations.  I hope we do that, and I am eager to  be a partner in doing that.  ",2015
338,House,114,0.568,101,2015-06-25,Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  rise  today  to offer an  amendment to the fiscal year 2016 Interior Appropriations bill that will help  strengthen transparency and oversight  at the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. My amendment simply provides $1 million in additional funding  for the Office of Inspector General at  the EPA.  I thank Chairman KENCALVERT for  working with me on this amendment.  Under  the  current administration,  the EPA has waged an all-out war on  jobs in the beautiful Second District of  West Virginia  and  on  communities  across America. With this backdrop, I  think it is absolutely critical that we  strengthen oversight and transparency  at the EPA. Taxpayers deserve to know  what is going on behind the curtain.  The Office of the Inspector General  plays a critical oversight role within  the EPA. It is the independent office  that works  diligently  to  root  out  waste, fraud, and abuse. For example, a  May 28, 2015, report found that two separate EPA employees were viewing pornography at work for up to 6 hours a  day, and they were paid in the neighborhood of $120,000 a year while doing  it.  The same report found that Renee  Page, who at the time was Director of  the EPA’s Office of Administration, allegedly sold  jewelry and weight  loss  pills out of her office. But she didn’t  stop there with her abuses. She hired  not one, not two, but 17 family members and friends for paid internships at  the EPA.  These are just two examples of the  incredible abuses of public trust and of  taxpayer dollars  that occur at  the  EPA. Without rigorous oversight from  the  inspector  general,  these  abuses  might never have been exposed.  My amendment provides additional  oversight  funding without  increasing  the budgetary impact of the fiscal year  2016 Interior Appropriations bill. We  pull the money from the Office of Public Affairs, which is the office responsible  for promoting  the administration’s radical environmental agenda,  and use it instead for oversight.  I would  encourage my  colleagues  today to cast their vote in favor of my  amendment.  ",2015
339,House,114,0.598,108,2015-06-25,Mr. GOHMERT.," Mr. Speaker, it has  been a big day over at the Supreme  Court and a big day for the Constitution as the Constitution has taken a  rather profound hit.  I understand the rules, Mr. Speaker.  The rules are made clear. We will not  impugn anybody’s integrity and office  up here, so I am not talking about an  individual,  I am  talking about how  completely  dishonest,  disingenuous,  and how much affront to the Constitution and pure candor the majority’s  opinion is at the Supreme Court.  Nothing  is more of an  indictment  against the majority opinion than at  the end of the opinion itself. The majority indicted themselves with their  own words.  At the end of the majority opinion,  the majority says,  ‘‘In a democracy,  the power to make the law rests with  those chosen by the people. Our role is  more confined’’—and then quotes from  Marbury v. Madison—‘‘to say what the  law is.’’  The Court  today goes on  to  say:  ‘‘That is easier in some cases than in  others. But in every case we must respect the role of the legislature, and  take care not to undo what it has done.  A fair reading of legislation demands a  fair understanding of the  legislative  plan.  ‘‘Congress passed the Affordable Care  Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them. If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a  way that is consistent with the former,  and avoids the latter. Section 36B can  fairly be read consistent with what we  see as Congress’ plan, and that is the  reading we adopt.’’  The judgment of the United States  Court of Appeals Fourth Circuit is affirmed.  That majority opinion is an indictment of the majority. The Constitution  is  worthless—absolutely  worthless—  when we have a majority of the Supreme Court that makes up law or in  this case says: Do you know what? We  know what Congress passed, we have  read it, and we get it.  It makes exceedingly clear that unless a State sets up a State exchange  for health care, then that State will be  punished by not getting subsidies. That  was debated, and that was included by  the majority of the House and Senate  without a single Republican vote, not a  single Republican vote.  As the  former chair of Ways and  Means told some of our Members: We  don’t need your vote, and we don’t  want your input.  They did it as one party, jamming  this down the throats of the Republican Party and the majority of the  American people. That is why they lost  the majority in November 2010.  They made it very clear. If you don’t  set up a State exchange, you don’t get  the subsidies in your State. God bless  all the States that stood up and said:  No, this is wrong. A majority of the  American people didn’t want this. You  passed this without any  input  from  nearly a majority of the constituents  that are represented by Republicans.  You didn’t care that it was the most  partisan a bill that has ever passed in  Congress. You didn’t care. You forced  it. It is bad for Americans, and we are  not going to help you by setting up a  State exchange. Yes, we understand  the law is very clear. Our State doesn’t  get the subsidies from the Federal Government—those are called bribes to be  more literal—our State won’t get the  bribes that you throw back at us that  came from our taxpayers if we don’t  set up the State exchanges. We understand that.  So what happens? The people that  passed that bill and the President that  helped  pass  the  bill  and  forced  it  through and signed it realized they had  made a major mistake, and rather than  come and get Republicans to fix the  disaster they had created, the President who had indicated he has a pen  and he has a phone, decided: That allows me to make law, create new law,  and change law completely that I have  already signed into law because I got a  pen and a phone, I can just change it  upon my whim.  The  President  basically  decided,  through his administration, they decided that they would set up Federal  exchanges.

341,,114,0.503,164,2015-06-25,Mr. CULBERSON.," Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer’s & Brain Awareness Month, an opportunity to raise awareness and continue a national conversation about this debilitating disease, which is the nation’s sixth leading cause  of death.  Worldwide, there are 47 million people living  with Alzheimer’s and other dementias, and  without a change,  these numbers are expected to grow to 76 million by 2030. Not only  will this affect individuals and families with an  unmeasurable  toll of physical and emotional  pain, it will also cost our entire economy and  health care system billions. Just  this year  alone,  the disease  is estimated  to cost us  $226 billion.  Even more concerning, Mr. Speaker, is the  fact that Alzheimer’s disease is not treatable  and its progression cannot be slowed down.  However, I am encouraged by the important  work  that researchers are doing at  the National Institute of Health regarding this deadly  disease. Furthermore, I am glad that my colleagues and I in the House came together in  a responsible and bi-partisan manner  to not  only increase funding to $31.2 billion for the  NIH ($1.1 billion above fiscal year 2015 and  $100 million above  the President ’s request);  but within that allocation provided $886 million  for the Alzheimer’s disease research initiative,  a $300 million  increase.  I am hopeful  that  these research dollars will go a long way to  treating, and ultimately curing this disease.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE HONEY  POT VOLUNTEER ACTIVE FIRE  DEPARTMENT’S  50TH ANNIVERSARY  HON.

342,,114,0.275,164,2015-06-25,Mr. BARLETTA.," Mr. Speaker, it is my honor  to help commemorate the 50th anniversary of  the establishment of The Honey Pot Volunteer  Active Fire Department in Honey Pot, Pennsylvania, which continually works to ensure public safety within my congressional district. Out  of seven fire departments in the City of Nanticoke, it is the only independent station supported solely from fundraisers and the State  fire grant.  After a devastating  fire  consumed  three  houses, a group of Honey Pot residents chartered the department in April of 1965. Under  the leadership of the department’s first chief,  Theadore Zdiarski, the organization raised sufficient funds to purchase a $32,000 1965 FWD  pumper through the sale of rags, metals, and  other miscellaneous items; an impressive feat  in and of itself.  Throughout the years, the department has  responded to calls in neighboring municipalities such as Nanticoke, Wilkes Barre, Plymouth, Plymouth Township, Shickshinny, and  Dupont; service  that has greatly enhanced  public safety across Northeastern Pennsylvania. In 1992, the company created a junior  firefighter program. In doing so, the company  not only successfully increased their membership, but also engaged with local youths.  In addition  to  their stellar record of public  service,  the company has  repeatedly used  fundraising efforts as a way to positively influence the community. For example, when the  department needed to replace its aged pumper  truck  in 2000,  the members organized a  ‘cabbage roll,’ ’ a fundraiser where participants  compete in rolling heads of cabbage down a  hill. The cabbage  roll made  local headlines  across Northeastern Pennsylvania, and such  an event is testament to the integral role the  company plays in the local community outside  of the fire station.  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize  The Honey Pot Volunteer Active Fire Department as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. On  behalf of a grateful community, I wish to thank  the department and its members for their tireless service and unwavering commitment  to  increasing public safety.  f  RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT  OF DR.

343,,114,-0.263,164,2015-06-25,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor  of the career of Dr. Duane M. Ford, President  of Southwest Wisconsin Technical College. He  served as the fifth president of the College for  the past four years.  Dr. Ford grew up on a family farm outside  of Tonica, Illinois. He spent much of his childhood doing chores and helping out with the  farm work. He eventually went on to University  of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he received a Bachelor of Science  in Agronomy  with Highest and University Honors in 1977.  After  farming with his  father and brother  for  two years, he studied at Iowa State University,  where he received an M.S. and a Ph.D. He  then served as a Post-Doctorate Fellow in the  Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  In 1986, he began his career  in  teaching  and academic leadership at Truman State University  in Kirksville, Missouri, where he  first  discovered his passion for teaching. While at  Truman State, he served as Convener of the  Agricultural Science Discipline, as Associate  Division Head for the Division of Science, received a fellowship in the W.K. Kellogg National Leadership Program (1991–1994), and  studied for a sabbatical year at the Center for  Biotechnology Policy and Ethics at Texas  A&M University  (1993–1994).  In 1996, Dr.  Ford became the Chairperson of the Department of Agriculture at Southeast Missouri  State University in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.  From 1999–2011 he was Dean of the College  of Business, Industry, Life Science and Agriculture  at  the  University  of Wisconsin-  Platteville, where he also served as  Interim  Provost and Vice Chancellor before becoming  President of Southwest Tech in 2011.  Under President Ford ’s  leadership, Southwest Tech has become a premiere place for  high-quality, affordable education and training.  Dr. Ford has a strong relationship with businesses in the area, and he has adapted the  curriculum to reflect the needs of the nearly  12,000 students per year attending Southwest  Tech. Throughout his career, he has stayed  true to his Midwest roots. He was a creative  thinker and tireless advocate for education. I  personally have enjoyed working with Duane,  first at UW-Platteville,  then as President of  Southwest Tech, where his pursuit of quality  educational opportunities for his students was  inspirational. He will be missed.  Duane and his wife Sheri currently live in  Platteville, Wisconsin. They have  two adult  children, Hollie and Simon, a grandson, Matt,  and a cat named Dusty.  In his  retirement,  Duane looks forward to pursuing his hobbies  of running, bicycling, baking and disc golf. Dr.  Ford will continue to serve on the Board of Directors for Southwest Health Center.  f  IN HONOR OF HUGO TOTTINO  HON.

Sadly, too often it seems as if lessons from  history are overlooked or forgotten. But in Virginia, we are proud of our history, of our love  of freedom, and of our dedication to independence. I commend the important efforts of the  Virginia Society of the Sons of the American  Revolution  to keep  in our hearts and minds  American patriotism and  the memory of our  Revolutionary War heritage.  As a student of history myself, I could spend  hours discussing not only the various events  preceding and succeeding our nation’s  fight  for independence, but also the crucial role by  Virginians. Countless  patriots,  battles,  and  events from this pivotal period in our nation’s  history ought  to be commemorated and  remembered, battles including but not limited to  the Battle of Point Pleasant, which is credited  as being the first battle of the American Revolution by the Senate of the United States, to  the Battle of Great Bridge, the Burning of Norfolk, etc.  May we  forever remain vigilant and committed  to preserving and protecting  the self-  evident truths and freedoms fought for and so  carefully outlined in our nation’s founding documents by our Founding Fathers.  I extend to all those involved with the Virginia Society of  the Sons of  the American  Revolution my best wishes on the occasion of  its 125th anniversary, and look forward to this  organization’s continued success.  f  BIOGRAPHY OF MARY BROOM-  THOMAS  HON.

My legislation will allow all veterans  to receive official ID cards through the  VA. No longer will veterans be forced  to carry around documents that contain sensitive  information that puts  them at needless risk of identity theft,  and it does all this at no cost to the  taxpayer.

351,House,114,-0.39,34,2015-07-07,Mr. BEYER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding, and I also thank the chairman for his comments.  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to speak in  support of Mr. GRIJALVA’s amendment.  The U.S. is the world’s second largest  market  for  ivory. Only China has a  greater demand.  In February of last year, President  Obama announced a ban on the commercial trade of elephant ivory. This  ban is the best way to ensure that U.S.  markets do not contribute to the further decline of African elephants in the  wild.  The African elephant population has  declined by an estimated 50 percent  over the last 40 years, with approximately 35,000 elephants poached every  year. That amounts to one elephant  poached every 15 minutes.  The Fish and Wildlife Service has  been undertaking a series of administrative actions, including a proposed  rule in order to implement the ban.  Section 120 would prevent the Fish and  Wildlife Service  from  implementing  this rule and other policies necessary  to crack down on the domestic illegal  ivory market.  I cannot understand why we would  not do everything possible to stop the  illegal slaughter of African elephants.  I urge my colleagues to support Mr.  GRIJALVA’s amendment, which would  prevent section 120 from being enacted.  We must allow the FWS to continue its  efforts to prevent the extinction of the  African elephant.  ",2015
352,House,114,0.425,34,2015-07-07,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Chairman, I  have an amendment at the desk.  ",2015
353,House,114,-0.444,41,2015-07-07,Mr. LOWENTHAL.," Mr. Chair, I rise  in opposition to the amendment. The  Bureau of Land Management has only  just begun the process of examining  whether royalty rates and rentals for  oil and gas  leases on public  lands  should  be  increased.  That  process  should be allowed to continue.  GAO recently found that, based upon  the results of a number of studies, the  U.S. Government receives one of the  lowest government  takes, commonly  understood to be the total revenue, as  a percentage of the value of oil and  natural gas produced  in  the  entire  world.  For example, royalty rates on public  land are at 12.5 percent, considerably  less than the royalty rates even on  State lands, which range from a low of  16.67 percent to 25 percent-plus. These  low royalty rates cheat the American  taxpayers and keep them from receiving a fair return for the extraction of  their oil and gas resources.  However, rental rates are even worse.  To secure very valuable mineral rights,  sometimes worth hundreds of millions  of dollars, companies only have to bid  a minimum, and I repeat, a minimum  of $2 an acre upfront to win the lease  and then $1.50 per acre each year to  keep the lease. That is right, a rental  of $1.50 per acre per year. This  low  price was last set by Congress in the  1980s and has not been adjusted since.  This can and should change. Oil companies, some of which generate billions  of dollars per quarter in profits, should  pay their fair share to the American  people for the development of the Nation’s public resources. Imagine if your  rent had not  increased since Ronald  Reagan was President or if the local  grocery  store had not  raised  their  prices since 1987.  ",2015
354,House,114,0.202,69,2015-07-07,Mr. FITZPATRICK.," Mr. Chairman, I  intend to offer and then withdraw this  amendment which will make it easier  for land preservation efforts, including  under the Federal Forest Legacy Program.  During my time as a local official in  Pennsylvania as a Bucks County commissioner, I was proud to lead local efforts to preserve the beauty of the  countryside  and  the Bucks County  landscape, while advancing smarter development  initiatives  to  reclaim  brownfields through commonsense conservation efforts.  Along with a task force for that purpose, our community was able to expend approximately $100 million for the  preservation  of  farmland,  parkland,  and critical natural areas, close  to  about 15,000 acres in our one county  preserved.  Now, as a strong advocate for land  preservation in Congress, I continue to  be a supporter of vital conservation  programs, including the United States  Forest Service’s Forest Legacy Program.  My amendment today would reallocate $5.9 million from the Bureau of  Land Management, Management  of  Lands and Resources, to the Forest  Legacy Program  for  the purpose of  fully funding two additional preservation projects.  The Forest Legacy Program is a Federal program that supports and encourages State and private efforts to protect  environmentally  sensitive  forestlands. The  program helps  the  States develop and carry out their forest conservation plans, while encouraging and  supporting acquisition of  conservation  easements without  removing the property from private ownership.  Most conservation easements restrict  development, require sustainable  forestry practices, and protect other values.  The additional  funding my amendment provides will allow for the protection of 4,000 acres of Pennsylvania  forests in the Northeast Connection.  Mr. Chairman, the Northeast Connection  is a collaboration between  the  Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and three  groups of over 150 families to conserve  more than 4,000 contiguous forest acres  which serve as a natural bridge between the 84,000-acre Delaware State  Forest, which is managed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the  77,000-acre Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, managed by  the National Park Service.  I believe this project is a crucial objective  to preserving Pennsylvania’s  and our Nation’s natural resources and  beauty.  Again, I want to thank the chairman  for his hard work on the underlying  bill. I look forward to working with the  funding  for this  chairman on robust  program.  ",2015

356,,114,-0.334,237,2015-07-07,Mr. ISRAEL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a true hero, Ben Zion Colb, and to  thank him for his heroic efforts and great sacrifice in saving Jews in Poland during World  War II. Ben Zion Colb went to great lengths to  save his fellow Jews from extermination by the  Nazis.  Ben Zion’s brave endeavor began when he  sent a courier to escort his then-fiance´e, Clara  Lieber, from Poland to Slovakia, where the deportation of Jews had been temporarily halted.  After succeeding in bringing Clara to safety,  he realized he could use the same method he  used to smuggle Clara across the border to  help other Jews escape from Poland. With the  help of his friend Rabbi Michael Weissmandl  and a network of couriers, he succeeded in  bringing most likely over one thousand Jews  across the border. Ben Zion largely focused  on  the rescue of children, who came  to be  known as ‘ ‘Ben Zion’s Kinder. ’ ’ After the war,  Ben Zion and Clara eventually made their way  to New York, where they raised three children.  Ben Zion passed away in 1973, but his inspiring legacy still lives on.  I was fascinated to learn of the many documents that still exist, which detail the history of  Ben Zion Colb’s heroism. There are hand-written and typed papers with names of people  who were rescued. Sometimes these papers  include dates of birth, where these individuals  were from, where they crossed the border and  in some cases the actual day they crossed. I  hope these documents will continue to assist  in locating those individuals who were rescued  by Ben Zion Colb and help bring together families and their diverse histories.  I want to properly recognize Ben Zion Colb’s  sacrifices and  truly heroic efforts and  to remind my colleagues that individuals such as  Ben Zion serve as a reminder as to how one  person can make a difference in the lives of  many. Ben Zion Colb took it upon himself to  save as many lives as possible during a time  of great need and it is important that we strive  to live by his example.  f  RECOGNIZING  LOUIS  ‘‘MILKMAN’’  PATTERSON  FOR  HIS  OUTSTANDING COMMITMENT TO THE  BUFFALO COMMUNITY  HON.

357,,114,-0.345,237,2015-07-07,Mr. HIGGINS.," Mr. Speaker, I stand before  you today to recognize and honor Mr. Louis  Patterson for his engagement with the Buffalo  community. Mr. Patterson has been a committed, well-loved and  respected community  member for over 50 years.  Born in Birmingham Alabama in 1945, Mr.  Patterson moved to the Buffalo area in 1960  where he has remained ever since. Before retiring in 2013, Mr. Patterson worked for Upstate Dairy for 36 years where he would earn  his affectionate nickname, ‘ ‘Milkman.’ ’  A constant presence  in  the Buffalo swing  dance community, Mr. Patterson was and is  admired by many as both a great man and a  great dancer. He brings joy to those around  him not only through his own dancing but also  through his ardent support of other dancers  and organizations in the community. He is a  man who  lives up  to  the adage  that one  should give more than one receives in its fullest sense.  Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me a  few moments to honor and recognize Mr. Patterson.  I ask  that my colleagues  join me  in  congratulating Mr. Patterson on an accomplished history of community engagement, and  to commend him for the exemplary work he  has done to enrich the communities of Western New York.  f  IS ACADEMIC FREEDOM THREATENED BY CHINA’S INFLUENCE ON  U.S. UNIVERSITIES?

A native of St. Augustine, Florida, James  Ponce was born on July 19, 1917. His relatives descended  from  the  family of Juan  Ponce de Leon.  Ponce grew up in the downtown area of St.  Augustine, where his father owned R. Ponce  Funeral Home. As a young boy he recalls his  father  burying  American  Tycoon,  Henry  Flagler, and other prominent  figures of  the  community. In addition, Ponce has stated that  his days at St. Joseph Academy afforded him  the opportunity to learn about how Florida became a U.S. territory.  This early exposure to America’s Oldest City  cemented his passion for the rich history that  Florida boasts. Since  that  introduction as a  child, Ponce has dedicated his  life  to preserving and sharing the histories of St. Augustine,  the Breakers, and Palm Beach. Ponce  also proudly served his country in the Navy  during World War II and the Marines during  the Korean War. Since  the 1950s, he has  called Palm Beach County home. During his  time at the Breakers Hotel and Resort, Ponce  worked at the front desk and eventually retired  as an assistant manager. As of now, he conducts weekly walking  tours of  the Breakers.  Ponce  is  the official historian of  the Palm  Beach Chamber of Commerce and has also  served as the President of the Historical Society of Palm Beach.  Throughout  his  career  and  retirement,  Ponce has been recognized for his vast historical knowledge. In 1996 the Palm Beach Town  Council named him ‘ ‘Palm Beach ’s only two-  legged, historical landmark.’ ’ He is the recipient of the Providencia Award from the Palm  Beach Country Convention and Visitors Bureau, which recognizes an individual or agency  that contributes  to  the prosperity of  the  tourism industry in the county.  James Ponce  is an exceptional man, and  one whom I am proud to represent in Florida’s  22nd District. I know I join with his family and  friends in celebrating this wonderful occasion.  I wish him good health and continued success  in the coming years.  f  IN HONOR OF THE  COMO HIGH  SCHOOL,  1914–1971,  10TH  ALL  SCHOOL REUNION CELEBRATION  HON. MARC A. VEASEY  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 7, 2015  ",2015
360,,114,-0.403,244,2015-07-07,Mr. VEASEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Como High School’s 10th All School  Reunion Celebration on July 2 –5, 2015. This  celebration is a milestone for the Como community as it recognizes its history and the impact Como High School had on its students.  From its inception, the Como community’s  location left its primarily black residents walled  in with a physical barrier separating Como  from  the  surrounding  neighborhoods. This  physical separation prompted its residents to  meet  the needs of  the community  through  their own initiatives. In the fall of 1914, Como  residents  felt an urgent need  for a  formal  school to educate the black youth of the community. During its first year, Como Elementary  School housed 11 students and employed one  teacher by the name of Ms. Lucinda Baker.  Unfortunately, after  two years  the school  was closed due to low enrollment and did not  reopen  for  its second  term until 1917. The  school was ultimately  reestablished  the  following year in 1918, where Mrs. Pearl Walker  Connor served as the head teacher.  After World War  I,  the Como community  began to grow rapidly. As more people moved  into the community there was a greater need  for a bigger and better school building. Under  the leadership of Mr. R. N Riddles, the county  superintendent, a building with two rooms was  built on the southeast corners of Faron and  Bonnell Streets.  During the time of expansion, Mrs. Gertrude  Wilkerson-Starners was appointed head teacher with Mrs. Geneva Carrington serving as her  assistant. Later Mrs. Jessie Raliegh and Mrs.  A. Greenwood joined the staff and Mrs. M. L.  Patterson came to the school as a teacher in  1931.  The men of the community initially supplied  coal for heating and kept the grounds clean;  but as the school began to grow, the need for  custodial  personnel  became  necessary.  In  1933, Mr. John Atkins was hired as the first  full time custodian.  Although no formal record exists, it is clear  that the need for a high school naturally grew  as the community had more students to educate. Additional teachers were added in 1935,  and  the  school moved  to occupy Libbey,  Goodman, Horne and Hollaran Streets.  In  1935, Mr. J Martin Jacquet was hired as principal and served the institution for ten years  with Mr. Oscar M. Williams succeeding him in  1946. The current building was erected  in  1950 during Williams’ tenure as principal. Mr.  Wilbur H. Byrd served as Como High School ’s  last principal from 1967 until the school ’s closure in 1971.  Como Elementary School and Como High  School grew from humble beginnings to a 33  room ultra-modern structure that housed an industrial arts room, a gymnasium, a 500 person  auditorium; a chemistry lab, homemaking laboratories,  a  library, men ’s  and women ’s  lounges, and a group of offices for the administrative staff.  Between 1914 and 1965, Como Elementary  and Como High School’s prestige  increased  as their academic excellence was recognized  by the Southern Association of Colleges and  Secondary Schools.  In  1971,  the  sudden  shift  to  integrate  schools forced Como High School to close despite  its growth. Although school  integration  caused  the original Como High School  to  close, Como Elementary School and Como  Montessori Magnet School carry on its legacy  of community, unity and pride.  After Como High School’s closure the first  annual school reunion was held in July 1983.  Its subsequent reunions proved that the fond  memories of  the Como spirit  remain  in  the  hearts of former students and staff members  forever.  f  HONORING THE RAVENSBRUCK  ARCHIVE PROJECT  HON.

364,House,114,-0.509,36,2015-07-23,Mr. NADLER.," Madam Speaker, I rise  in strong opposition to H.R. 3009, which  would make communities across the  country less safe from crime.  This legislation would withhold needed Federal  funding  from cities that  prohibit  their  law  enforcement  authorities  from collecting  information  on a person’s  immigration status or  that have policies restricting the disclosure of this  information to other  governmental entities.  Many cities,  including New York,  have made the reasonable determination that they will not question victims of crime or witnesses to a crime  about their immigration status. They  believe it is counterproductive to make  them afraid to cooperate with law enforcement.  But this bill says that we in Congress  know better, and, in the name of protecting public safety, we will deny such  cities the funds that they need to protect the public safety.  Many cities think that their communities are safer when a victim of domestic violence feels comfortable asking the police for protection from their  abuser without fear of deportation.  They believe that witnesses to a murder ought to step forward and assist  law enforcement in tracking down the  perpetrator without fear that they will  face consequences of their own if they  step forward.  They think that good policing depends on building trust with their residents and that striking fear among immigrants that they may be deported if  they report a crime makes everyone  less safe.  Punishing residents of cities whose  officials have made such decisions is  both unfair and unwise. New York City  alone could lose $57 million under this  legislation.

While  the storm  caused widespread property damage and several injuries, the good people from across the  region who rushed to Cameron to help give  me hope that this community will rebuild and  become stronger than ever.  First responders and volunteers stepped in  at a time of great need and continue to provide safety, material assistance and comfort to  the good people of Cameron. They came from  all over the region bringing bottled water, tarps  and even homemade blueberry pies  to help  this town of 600 people get back on its feet  after 125 mile per hour winds tore through it  last week.  I spoke with many  families who were affected by the tornado, and there was a recurring theme that resonated with me: Cameron  was bent, not broken. With over 50 homes  damaged,  community members  and  other  helpers have been working tirelessly to support these families and straighten out all the  bends brought upon them by this disaster.  Mr. Speaker, my heart goes out to all the  families  this  terrible  tornado  impacted and  I  am grateful for the brave and generous first  responders and  volunteers who pour  their  time, energy, and love into helping Cameron  recover.  f  CONGRATULATING  THE  WESTMINSTER  PRESBYTERIAN  CHURCH OF BAY CITY ON THEIR  150TH ANNIVERSARY  HON. DANIEL T. KILDEE  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 23, 2015  ",2015
375,,114,-0.399,155,2015-07-23,Mr. KILDEE.," Mr. Speaker, I ask the United  States House of Representatives to join me in  recognizing Westminster Presbyterian Church  in Bay City, Michigan, on the occasion of their  150th anniversary.  Westminster’s sacred story began on August 23, 1865, when 15 members organized a  new Presbyterian Church  in  the Village of  Wenona. On the same day a cornerstone was  laid  for a house of worship on  two  lots donated by Henry W. Sage on Catherine St. The  house of worship for ‘ ‘The First Presbyterian  Society of the Township of Bangor’ ’ was completed and dedicated on December 3, 1865  under the leadership of Missionary Donald B  Campbell.  His mission complete, Rev. Campbell left in  1868 and Rev. Elihu Turney Sanford became  the first ordained minister of the new church.  Westminster has been privileged to be led by  a number of very capable  leaders over  the  past 150 years, to include our current minister  Rev. Matthew Schramm, who had the honor of  serving as a guest  chaplain  for  the U.S.  House of Representatives  in  the summer of  2014.  In 1872,  the name of  the  church was  changed to the ‘ ‘First Presbyterian Church of  Wenona ’ ’, and finally in 1882 to ‘ ‘Westminster  Presbyterian Church.’ ’ Also  in 1882 plans  were drawn for a new worship facility. Once  again Henry W. Sage came forward and donated  four  lots on Midland St where  the  church is presently located. On Christmas Day  in 1883, the congregation worshipped in their  new semi-gothic style church.  In 1958, ground was broken for a new Fellowship Hall, classrooms and a kitchen, and in  1969  the congregation endorsed a building  program for the existing Sanctuary with formal  dedication ceremonies in September 1970. In  2015, Westminster will begin  its next 150  years with a campaign to update the facility for  future generations.  The congregation has been active in ministry and service for 150 years. From working  in USO activities, collecting metal  for scrap  drives, and sending care packages to servicemen during the war years, to hosting literacy  programs for children and adults, serving free  hot meals  to  those  in need, and providing  quality Christian education for all ages today,  Westminster is well known in Bay City for its  community focus. The church is proud to have  been a charter organization for the Boy Scouts  for over 50 years, and to open its doors for  programs ranging from job training for special  needs young adults to music and theatre rehearsal, and  to provide meeting space  for  countless community organizations.  Westminster has been a proud partner with  the Good Samaritan Rescue Mission in Bay  City since  its  inception. Not only has  the  church been an annual supporter during each  of the mission’s ten years of operation, it was  instrumental in the construction and opening  of the men ’s wing of the mission in 2008. In  2015 Westminster helped sponsor  the mission ’s annual Golf Challenge Fund Raiser,  which earned a near record $73,000 to provide a place of hope and care for the needy  in and around Bay City.  Westminster actively supports missions  in  Niger, India, Zambia, Thailand, and the Middle  East, while also supporting disaster relief efforts throughout the world. Both pastors and  members of the congregation have assumed  an active role in leading the Lake Huron Presbytery and  the Presbyterian Church  (USA)  General Assembly.  Through partnering with quality programs  and  organizations,  sharing  fellowship  and  service,  inspiring  teaching and worship, and  outwardly-focused and selfless mission, Westminster seeks  to  further  its own  legacy of  hope and care in Bay City since 1865, and  looks forward to the next 150 years serving  God and humanity, sharing the love of Jesus  through faith, hope and love, with an open and  genuine spirit.  Mr. Speaker,  I applaud  the work done by  the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Bay  City and thank them for the service they have  provided to the community.

In 1965, NORWESCAP was incorporated by  a group of concerned citizens from Hunterdon,  Sussex and Warren counties, whose mission  was  to  eliminate  poverty  in  the  area.  NORWESCAP is one of twenty-three Community Action Agencies in the State of New Jersey. The agency actively supports low-income  households, as  these citizens develop  their  abilities to become self-reliant and build relationships within the community.  Over the past fifty years, the agency has expanded its reach into Morris, Somerset, and  Passaic Counties. NORWESCAP assists more  than 35,000 individuals each year, with a portfolio of emergency, preventative and self-sufficiency services. With 270  full and part-time  employees and 1,400 volunteers operating 15  unique programs, the agency has been working to improve the lives of low income individuals and families by ‘ ‘Creating Opportunities’ ’  and ‘ ‘Changing Lives.’ ’ An example of one of  their programs is the Family Success Center,  which brings together residents and leaders in  the community to address the struggles that  poverty-ridden families deal with every day.  Another  significant  program  that  NORWESCAP provides is the Child and Family Resource Services. With twenty-five years  of enhancing  the accessibility and quality of  early care and education,  the agency has  proven its dedication to strengthening families  and communities in the area. The Child and  Family Resource Service staff is committed to  the belief that all children deserve access to  quality affordable child care. Furthermore, by  providing  information,  referrals, various child  care subsidies, education and collaboration of  efforts among all those involved in child care,  this  team has had a positive effect on  the  community. CFRS has been cited for ‘ ‘a number of best practices regarding the management of the programs they implement.’ ’ They  became Child Care Aware Quality Assured in  2005;  this  identifies  the agency as one  that  strives for excellence.  It is apparent that NORWESCAP’s value to  the public is priceless, and I express great admiration for their service.  Mr. Speaker, please  join me  in congratulating NORWESCAP,  its Board of Directors,  administration and employees, as it celebrates  its Fiftieth Anniversary.  25TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES  ACT  HON.

377,,114,0.223,162,2015-07-23,Mr. REICHERT.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  recognize the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act  (ADA). This  landmark  legislation was critical  to ensuring all  Americans living with disabilities were guaranteed equal access to opportunities to live a full  and meaningful life without being discriminated  against. With over 55 million people living in  our nation with disabilities,  it  is sometimes  hard to realize that before 1990, so many barriers stood in their way to leading happy, successful lives.  My own godson lives with significant disabilities and if this law had not been enacted before he was born, his life would have turned  out very differently—it would have been difficult to access transportation, public and private spaces, and receive an education. It is so  important that we continue building upon the  successes of the ADA and that we do everything within our power for those who need us  to fight just a little bit extra for them, and that  is why we must remember this anniversary.  f  TRIBUTE TO JACOB ‘‘JAY’’  BOJORQUEZ  HON.

378,,114,0.467,162,2015-07-23,Mr. CARTER of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to celebrate  the  life of Jacob  ‘Jay’ ’  Bojorquez. A resident of Temple, Texas, Jay  became an angel on  July 13, 2015. My  thoughts and prayers are with his family and  friends during this difficult time.  Jay was a native son of Monticello, New  Mexico. His was a life of service and devotion  to causes bigger than himself. Growing up in  the rugged Land of Enchantment  instilled  in  Jay a desire to protect our environment and,  as a young man, he volunteered to fight forest  fires in the scenic Black Range Mountains. As  a Korean War veteran, Jay experienced firsthand the sacrifices our men and women of the  armed forces make for the cause of freedom.  Blessed with a fierce intellect and aptitude  with numbers, Jay graduated  from Western  New Mexico University with a bachelor’s degree in accounting. He applied his talents as  a  financial auditor  for El Paso’s Thomason  General Hospital.  Committed to public service, Jay played an  active part in making any community he resided in a great place to live and work. Jay  served as an elected member of the Horizon  Regional Municipal Utilities District Board of  Directors, Commander of the American Legion  Post, President of the Lion’s Club, President  of the Horizon Communities Improvement Association, Treasurer of the Horizon Volunteer  Fire Department, and a member of the Troop  Committee  for Boy Scout Troop 55  (Yucca  Council). He also served on the City of Temple’s Tax  Increment Finance Reinvestment  Zone Board.  Jay was married to Betty, the love of his life,  47 years. During  their  joyous  life  together,  they  lived,  loved, and prospered as one.  Proud parents of seven children, grandparents  of eighteen, and great-grandparents of  fourteen, Jay and Betty kept family at the center  of their lives.  While we mourn Jay Bojorquez’s passing,  his presence was a blessing for all who knew  him. The positive impacts he had on the lives  of others will live on and remain in our hearts  forever.  f  IN HONOR OF CORPORAL STEVEN  L. LEVY  HON.

We attended his funeral a few weeks  back, and I just want to say there were  so many great stories that came about  through his passing—from his family  and from his grandkids, who gave beautiful eulogies, stories of their grandfather.  This is just to say, when I first got to  the United States Congress as a young  Congressman of 29 years old, it was  Congressman Stokes who sat in my office, who gave me counsel, who was always there and was always in a good  mood, who was always joking and playing around and having a good time; but  he took his job very seriously and took  being a Member of Congress very seriously.  The striking and remarkable thing  about him was, no matter how high up  the ladder he moved, he always had  time. Whether it was for a young boy  or girl in Cleveland or a new Congressman from Youngstown, he had time. He  shared his advice, and he shared his  counsel. He was  such a  remarkable  man.  When you think of the word ‘‘gentleman,’’ that was Congressman Lou  Stokes. He was a gentle man and, I  think, embodied the kind of character  we want our young men in Ohio to look  up to and aspire to be.  I wanted to take a minute here on  the House floor to thank him for all he  did for me and all he did for Ohio and  all he did for this country. He was a  great man, and he will be missed. Our  hearts and our prayers go out to him  and his family.  f  VOTE FOR NEW AMERICAN  LEADERSHIP AND WORLD PEACE  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

382,House,114,0.602,20,2015-09-08,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. Speaker, in the  past year, our Nation has witnessed an  unspeakable tragedy—a rivalry of law  enforcement officers and the communities they work so hard to protect.  From riots in Ferguson and Baltimore to, most recently, the individual  targeting and murdering of police officers, our Nation is at a crossroads.  We find ourselves asking:  When will the rule of law and those  who enforce that law, once again, be  respected?  How many more violent protests and  threatening  chants will  those who  bravely wear the badge have to put up  with?  How much more taunting under the  guise of a misleading slogan be tolerated  before  community  organizers,  prominent African American  leaders,  and Democrats at the city, State, and  national levels say enough is enough?  When will we hear in unison: ‘‘It is  not okay to kill police officers’’?  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I are  here this evening to honor those in uniform who have fallen, but we are also  here to call for an end to this violence.  We are here to call for the restoration  of law and order. We are here to call for  the protection of the men and women  who put their lives on the line every  single day—the ones who chose a profession to help make their neighborhoods safer.  These are not  just police officers.  They are mothers; they are  fathers;  they are husbands and wives; they are  sons and daughters. Mr. Speaker, their  lives matter, too, and all lives matter.

A nearly-lifelong Marin resident and community  leader, he will be  remembered  for his  unyielding efforts to better lives in Marin City  and beyond.  From an early age, Mr. Fisher cared deeply  about others. He moved to Marin City a year  after his birth, and attended high school and  college in the North Bay. He first ran for office  at  the age of 23, serving on  the Sausalito-  Marin City School District board and later, for  the Marin City Community Services District  board. He also worked as a student counselor  at his alma mater, the College of Marin, and  became an engineer by profession.  Mr. Fisher’s efforts will continue to impact  lives long after his passing. He was involved  with the Marin City Health and Wellness Center, Bayside Martin Luther King Jr. School,  and the recently-opened Rocky Graham Park.  A new community center for Marin City—one  of his dreams—has begun the planning process.  Robert Fisher ’s lifetime dedication to public  service exemplifies an  inspirational spirit of  generosity and a model for others to follow. It  is therefore appropriate that we pay tribute to  him  today and express our deepest condolences to his wife, Agnes, his sister, Lue Ann,  and his children.

She  leaves behind her loving family, including her  daughter Julie, and granddaughters, Taylor  and Morgan Marsoobian. Fresno County  is  truly indebted to Rosellen ’s legacy of service,  integrity and love.  Rosellen Kershaw was born on August 29,  1923, to Charles and Pinkie Kershaw in Fresno, California. She spent almost her entire life  in the Central Valley, graduating from Fresno  High School and Fresno State College. She  received her Master’s Degree from San Francisco State University.  Rosellen  taught school at  the elementary,  high school and college levels. However, she  consistently referred to herself as a ‘ ‘professional volunteer,’ ’ having dedicated more than  50 years of her life to the causes and organizations in Fresno that she felt most passionate  about. Ms. Kershaw was committed to improving her community one hour at a time.  The  fruits of Rosellen’s  labors were  reflected in her involvement with local organizations and clubs, such as the Ani Guild of the  California Armenian Home, of which she was  a  founder and board member  for over 40  years. She was also President of the League  of Women Voters of Fresno, California State  President of American Association of University Women, Chair of the Fresno Housing and  Community Development Commission, Chair  of  the CSUF Arts and Humanities Advisory,  board member of the Fresno Regional Foundation, Secretary of the Fresno County Grand  Jury, board member of the California Journal,  President of  the Fresno Art Museum, and  President of the Friends of Fresno County Library. In addition, she was a founder and first  general manager  of Valley Public Radio.  Among her many achievements, Rosellen received the California Rotary Paul Harris Fellow  accolade, and was awarded the CSU Fresno  Top Dog Award for Service.  Rosellen Kershaw was  an  extraordinary  woman with a commitment to family, friends  and her community. Her service will forever be  remembered by  the  lives she so graciously  touched. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect  that I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the life of  Rosellen Kershaw, a true pillar of our community who will never be forgotten.  f  HONORING SHARON SILVA  HON.

399,,114,0.309,111,2015-09-08,Mr. DENHAM.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge and honor Turlock Chamber of  Commerce Chief Executive Officer Sharon  Silva for her many years of profound service  to Turlock. After  fifteen years of dedicated  work, she retired on August 31, 2015.  Born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, Sharon moved to the small town of Turlock, California with her family. Sharon found the time  to  further her education at Modesto Junior  College  and  California  State  University,  Stanislaus where she received her Bachelor’s  degree in Organizational Communications. In  addition,  she graduated  from  the National  Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington,  D.C. with a Main Street Certification Institute  Certification in Historic Preservation and also  from  the US Chamber  Institute  in Chamber  Management at  the University of Arizona  in  2004.  For eight and half years, Sharon served as  the Executive Director of  the Turlock Downtown Association, where she made enduring  contributions to beautifying and restoring the  historic downtown of Turlock. Among numerous activities  that celebrated  the culture of  Turlock, she planned major community events  such as  the Festival of Lights Tree Lighting  Ceremony and the Fourth of July parade. During Mrs. Silva ’s  last  three years with  the  Downtown Association, she was promoted to  the position of Chief Executive Officer for the  Turlock Chamber of Commerce and Convention  and  Visitor’s  Bureau,  and  diligently  oversaw all three agencies. Sharon has been  a beacon  in  the community and an  integral  part of the non-profit organization’s success.  Volunteering  is second nature  to Sharon;  she has been a part of  several different  boards and a vital member of many different  clubs and organizations. Appointed by  the  Mayor of Turlock and confirmed by the City  Council, Sharon was one of nine committee  members  to become a part of  the Development Collaborative Advisory Committee, and  provide advice and recommendations  to  the  city  for  improving  the business climate. Furthermore, Sharon was co-chair of the Turlock  Centennial Celebration  in 2008, sat on  the  Board of Directors for the Turlock Community  Theatre, and is a longtime member of the Rotary Club of Turlock. Sharon is a past member  of  the Turlock Unified School District Board  and sits on a number of CSU Stanislaus committees: the President’s Advisory council, the  College of Business Board, the Alumni Board,  the CSUS Warrior Association, and lastly, and  the Center for Public Policies Studies Advisory  Board. She served on Stanislaus County’s  Economic Development Committee and on the  Board of Directors for the Stanislaus County  Alliance Workforce. She was also the chair of  the county’s Redistricting Committee in 2011.  Mrs. Silva stands as a role model for community dedication. Being actively  involved and  connected within  the community as Sharon  Silva has been, it comes as no surprise that  she has received numerous awards and recognitions. In 1995, she received the Turlock  Citizen of  the Year Award and Volunteer of  the Year Award at the Best of Turlock Awards  Dinner. While serving as the Executive Director for the Turlock Downtown Association, the  organization  received  the Governor’s Award  for Excellence in Revitalization Achievement in  Design. The Turlock Chamber of Commerce  was one of ten chambers in the state of California to be a CalChamber’s President Circle  Recipient for six years in a row.

400,,114,0.409,1,2015-09-17,Mr. GUTHRIE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in memory of Kentucky State  Trooper Cameron Ponder of Rineyville,  Kentucky.  I believe many people watched or saw  with  horror  the  news  that  spread  across this country that another one of  our public service officers was killed  this week. Only 31 years old, Cameron  was shot and killed during an on-duty  traffic stop earlier this week.  Known by his peers and in the community as an athlete, Cameron was an  all-State performer in track and was  the kicker on the football team in high  school. After graduating  from North  Hardin High School near Fort Knox,  Cameron joined the U.S. Navy, turning  down a track scholarship.  More personally, Cameron was a son,  an uncle, and a fiance. Cameron graduated from the Kentucky State Police  Academy in January and had been a  trooper for less than 9 months.  Among the many condolences that  have been  shared are  those of his  former Navy colleagues, who  talked  about his devotion to our country.  While Cameron was taken  far too  soon, his commitment to service and  community has not gone unnoticed. I  join with all of Kentucky’s Second District in sending prayers to Cameron’s  family, friends, and his Kentucky State  Police brethren. We will miss him and  are thankful for his service.  f  CLIMATE CHANGE AND PUBLIC  HEALTH  ",2015
401,,114,-0.317,1,2015-09-17,Mr. QUIGLEY.," Mr. Speaker, there  was a time when climate change was a  concern for future generations, a time  when we focused on predicting the possible problems and brainstorming the  possible solutions, a time when the  threat was real, but we still had time  to act. We had not come face-to-face  with our tipping point.  That  time  has  passed. President  Obama put it best when he said: ‘‘We  are the first generation to feel the impacts of climate change, and the last  generation that can still do something  about it.’’  The time to act is now, and the call  to action cannot be any clearer. Despite the fact that more than 12,000  peer-reviewed scientific studies are in  agreement that climate change is real  and humans are significantly to blame,  my colleagues continue to debate its  validity. Well, if the devastating global  and environmental threats aren’t proof  enough, let me share some of the negative impacts climate change is having  on our air quality and public health  now.  Simply put, climate change and air  pollution make a dangerous pair. In  fact, air pollution is among the most  serious, indirect health effects of global climate change. The same power  plants that release harmful carbon dioxide into our atmosphere also create  dangerous  levels of soot, smog, and  ground-level ozone. The  result  is a  combination of ozone and fine particles  that can have devastating health impacts. In all, 147 million people in the  U.S., nearly half of this Nation—our  Nation—are breathing unhealthy air.  And the news is far worse in Beijing,  where a new study claims that the air  in Beijing is so polluted, breathing it  does as much damage to the lungs as  smoking 40 cigarettes a day. That is  simply unacceptable.  To make matters worse, the warmer  temperatures from climate change are  only increasing the frequency of days  with unhealthy levels of ground-level  ozone. If emissions of air pollutants remain fixed at today’s levels until 2050,  warming  from climate change alone  could increase the number of red ozone  alert days by 68 percent in the 50 largest Eastern U.S. cities.  Studies have also  linked breathing  and ozone pollution to an  increased  risk of premature deaths and difficulty  breathing. If there are no changes in  regulatory controls, the CDC predicts  up to 4,300 additional premature deaths  in the United States by the year 2050  from  combined  ozone  and  particle  health effects.  The good news is that air quality has  improved dramatically in many American cities over the past 40 years due to  the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act  has a track record of cutting dangerous  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

402,House,114,-0.313,15,2015-09-17,Mr. HECK of Washington.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so that we might indeed take up  legislation to reauthorize the Export-  Import Bank. Because I think the gentleman  from Georgia has  it exactly  right, the question before this Chamber, before this Congress, before the  President, before the American people  is: Where are the jobs?  Now we know where the jobs, in part,  have come from over the last 8 years.  In fact, about 1.5 million of them have  come through the activity of the Export-Import Bank, where  they  supported $200 billion  in exports spread  out across  7,300 companies. And we  know where the jobs have not come  from since July 1, when the charter of  the Export-Import Bank expired, at  which time there were 116 deals frozen,  constituting $9.3 billion in activity.  Who were they?  Norwest Ingredients is a company in  my home State that sells mint  flavoring for the manufacturers of candy  and oral care. The company currently  employs about a dozen employees. It is  a small business.  Without Ex-Im, many  small businesses like Norwest aren’t going to be  able to extend terms to foreign buyers,  and they will have to ask for cash in  advance. When they do, they will lose  their business to other countries who  have export credit authorities.  By way of reminder, every single developed nation on the face of the Earth  has an export credit authority right  now, except the United States of America.  Combustion Associates in California,  they spent 3 years closing a deal for a  new  power  project  in Nigeria  that  would generate $39 million in revenue  and create 30 new American jobs. The  deal is on hold, along with two other  projects that would have been worth  nearly $50 million in revenue and 100  jobs.  GE, the gentlewoman from California  shared the sad news of the 500 jobs that  are  leaving  these  shores as a consequence of our failure to reauthorize  the Ex-Im.  Digital Check, an Illinois company,  sells check scanning equipment to clients in nearly 100 countries. Tom Anderson  is  the  family-run  company’s  chief executive. He says: We’re losing  now a quarter million in sales in British markets and around  $300,000  in  India. And that half-million-dollar hit  is causing the company to reevaluate  whether they will suspend, altogether,  their scanner leasing services.  FirmGreen—Steve Wilburn, president  of FirmGreen and, I might add, a proud  and highly decorated marine—laid off  10 of its 17 employees last year because  the company lost $60 million in contracts during our latest period of uncertainty.  They are now, right as we speak,  right as we are attempting to answer  the question of where are the  jobs,  competing for a $300 million project in  the Philippines, and it hinges on securing export credit financing from the  Ex-Im. Without  it,  that business  is  going to likely go to a South Korean  rival and, with it, the 400 jobs he would  have added.  Boeing,  again,  the  gentlewoman  made mention of layoffs in El Segundo,  California. That was not the first but  the second satellite sale to a foreign  company and country that we lost as a  consequence of  the uncertainty  surrounding the Export-Import Bank.  ",2015
403,,114,-0.474,113,2015-09-17,Mr. RICHMOND.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor the life of Calvin George Moret, the  last  surviving  Louisiana member  of  the  Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African-American pilots who  fought  in World War  II and  were  the  first African-American pilots  in  the  United States military. Mr. Moret passed away  on September 12, 2015, at the age of 90.  Mr. Moret entered the military in 1943 and  trained as a military pilot at Tuskegee, Alabama, receiving his wings and commission as  a Flight Officer on November 20, 1944. His  preparation for overseas combat duty continued through the end of the war in Europe and  then through the end of the war in the Pacific.  He was discharged  from military service on  January 31, 1946.  Following his discharge from military duty he  returned to the family printing business, Moret  Press. To help  the  family business Moret  needed  to  look outside of New Orleans  for  school, because segregation  laws prohibited  him from studying at Delgado Trade School.  He was able to gain admission to the printing  department at Southern University  in Baton  Rouge and completed the course.  Mr. Moret’s  flying experience did not stop  upon discharge from the military. In the spring  of 1949, he and his brother Adolph, who had  learned to fly before the war, formed a flying  club. Along with twenty other men, they purchased a 3-place Piper Super Cruiser airplane  and hangered it at Lakefront Airport in New  Orleans until the summer of 1953, where they  introduced members to the miracle of human  flight.  On June 17, 2008, as a result of Hurricane  Katrina and the flooding aftermath that decimated  the city, Moret Press was destroyed  and the family was separated for months. The  business has not operated since  the Friday  before the hurricane struck.  Following the release of ‘ ‘The Tuskegee Airmen’ ’ movie in 1995, Mr. Moret frequently lectured about his experiences and promoting the  proud history of African-American accomplishments in American life.  In 2007, Mr. Moret was present when he  Tuskegee Airmen received the Congressional  Gold Medal in the rotunda of the Capitol.  Mr. Moret was a  trailblazer, clearing  the  path for countless men and women of color to  enter  the military and  fight  to defend  their  country. He will be sorely missed by his family, his friends, and all of those who are able  to pursue their dreams because of his courage. His memory will serve an inspiration for  generations to come.  Mr. Speaker, as a beneficiary of Mr. Moret’s  courage, commitment and sacrifice, I celebrate  his  life and  legacy, because he has made  America a more perfect union.

Uzeyir Hajibeyli was born  in  the City of  Agjabadi  in Azerbaijan  on September  18,  1885. He is recognized as the father of Azerbaijani classical music, as well as the founder  of  the  first opera, Leyli and Majnun (1908),  and first operetta The Cloth Peddler (1913) in  the Muslim world. Arshin Mal Alan (The Cloth  Peddler), is a romantic and musical comedy  that delves into a young couple ’s struggle to  live a modern lifestyle in the presence of restricting customs through pure love and women ’s rights.  In 1945, a cinematic version of the operetta  was filmed in Azerbaijan and became an instant box office sensation. It remains today an  important cultural touchstone across Eurasia,  having been widely distributed  in 86  languages and shown in 136 countries.  Uzeyir Hajibeyli was influential in both cultural and historical contexts. Hajibeyli was responsible  for a new genre of music which  evolved from the culmination of traditional Azerbaijani music and European classical opera.  He is recognized as a leader in fighting illiteracy throughout the nation. As not only a musician but as a teacher and journalist, he inspired a new cultural movement  throughout  the nation that transcended the country’s borders. Further, Hajibeyli is responsible for composing the first national anthem of Azerbaijan.  Uzeyir Hajibeyli played an active role in the  creation of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic founded in 1918.  As  today marks  the 130th anniversary of  Uzeyir Hajibeyli’s birth, I am honored to recognize him today for his valuable contributions  towards the world of music and to Azerbaijan.  f  HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY  OF REVEREND JOSEPH C.

I am proud to  call Chief Hicks a good friend and thank him  for his dedicated service as Principal Chief.  After graduating from Western Carolina University, Chief Hicks served for twelve years as  the Principal Chief  for  the Eastern Band of  Cherokee  Indians, and prior  to  that served  eight years as  the Chief Finance Officer  for  the Eastern Band. During his tenure as Principal Chief, Chief Hicks was  instrumental  in  the completion of several vital service  facilities, such as the Shawn Blanton Emergency  Operations Center, the Snowbird Youth Center,  the new Justice Center and Jail, and a  new Cherokee Hospital, scheduled to open in  October of this year.  Additionally, Chief Hicks spearheaded many  educational efforts in the region. He developed  and implemented a reading program for kindergarten children in the region, he oversaw  the development of a  financial  literacy program for Cherokee youth, and he helped rekindle an interest in the Cherokee language by  including it as required curriculum at Cherokee  schools.  Chief Hicks  is known by his  friends as a  kind, compassionate man who, while cherishing the old Cherokee traditions, is a visionary for a better future for his people. His tremendous passion and vision earned him the  Tribal Leader of the Year Award from the Native American Finance Officers Association.  The exemplary  leadership and  vision of  Chief Hicks is something that all of us can admire and  respect. As such,  I am proud  to  honor Principal Chief Michell Hicks on his  faithful service to the people of Cherokee and  congratulate him on his retirement.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

406,,114,0.518,120,2015-09-17,Mr. BRADY of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  residents in Montgomery County are blessed to  have non-profit organizations  that provide a  true safety net for struggling families and individuals.  One of  those organizations  is  the Montgomery County Food Bank which has been  helping families since 1985.  This  food bank  is an  integral part of our  community today because a group of individuals led by Betty Hardy saw a need and found  a way to fill that need by partnering with other  agencies.  Betty Hardy has put others first as long as  any of us have known her. She is a blessing  to our community. She went from helping people on the crisis hotline to ensuring families in  need had a meal on the table.  Betty’s passion to put others first is what led  her  to  bring  together  several  like-minded  friends each week to organize and create food  pantries, food drives and deliveries.  Out of her commitment—and her garage,  trunk and backseat—grew  the program we  know as the Montgomery County Food Bank.  From the food bank’s initial one-room office  space  this program has grown  to  service  countless families.  The Food Bank went  from serving nearly  18,000 meals in the first year to 400,000 annual meals just a short decade later.  In 2007, the food bank opened its first official warehouse with the help of a community  development grant. Today, the food bank operates out of a 60,000 square foot facility that  distributes  several million  pounds  of  food  every year. They coordinate with a network of  approximately 50 food pantries, soup kitchens,  senior centers and other agencies to provide  fresh produce, meat and non-perishables  to  more than 32,000 people each month.  Betty’s dream of helping Montgomery County residents weather a crisis has evolved into  the sixth largest food bank in Texas.  Betty Hardy is proof that one person’s determination, dedication and willingness to roll up  her sleeves can have a far reaching impact on  individuals and  families who need  to know  there is hope and support in their community.

For Tribes, clean water and healthy salmon  are not just perks of life in the Pacific Northwest; they are the centerpiece of the Tribes’  history, culture, and way of life. Unfortunately,  changing ocean chemistry, degrading habitats,  and stormwater runoff are posing an existential threat to these resources.  Following  a  landmark  victory  reaffirming  treaty-protected fishing rights, the Tribes created the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission to assist them in developing biologically  sound fisheries and restore the salmon runs  that sustained their people for centuries.

409,,114,0.718,3,2015-10-13,Mr. BABIN.," Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 702, legislation by my friend and  Texas colleague Congressman JOEBARTON to  lift the ban on American exports of crude oil.  Lifting  this outdated and unnecessary ban  on crude oil exports is a win for Texas and  America. It opens up billions of dollars of new  economic opportunity  for American companies, which will create thousands of good paying jobs. It will help to stabilize the price of energy on  the world market, making sure  that  gasoline and electricity remains abundant and  affordable  for  hardworking  families  across  America. And South East Texas  is uniquely  positioned to be at the center of it all, with the  Port of Houston and other facilities in our area  uniquely suited to lead America into this new  market.  Unfortunately, and predictably,  the Obama  Administration has threatened to veto this bipartisan bill once it passes the House and the  Senate. This is the same Administration that  just led the way on a deal to lift the crude export ban that has been in place on the Islamic  Republic of Iran, a terrorist sponsoring regime  that will use the proceeds from selling crude  oil to finance terror and mayhem throughout  the world. Americans deserve better treatment  from their President than he is giving to terrorists in Iran, and I believe that if he vetoes this  bill, we will override that veto.  f  HONORING THE CREW OF EL FARO  HON.

410,,114,0.333,3,2015-10-13,Mr. CRENSHAW.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to the crew of the El Faro, the  790-foot container ship that recently perished  in the Atlantic during Hurricane Joaquin. We  cannot know the heartache that their families  and friends are facing in the midst of the unanswered questions surrounding this maritime  disaster. In their time of need, we send them  strong prayers of support to help ease their  pain.  The 33 crew members aboard the vessel,  18  from Florida, 12  from my hometown of  Jacksonville, 10 others from cities and towns  across America, and five Polish nationals, all  faced the toughest of odds from a Category 4  hurricane. These brave men and women include: Jacksonville residents Roosevelt Clark,  Brookie Davis, Frank Hamm, Carey Hatch,  Jack Jackson, Jackie Jones, Jr., Lonnie Jordan, Roan Lightfoot, James Porter, Theodore  Quammie,  Lashawn  Rivera  and  Anthony  Thomas. Florida residents Louis Champa of  Palm Coast, Keith Griffin of Fort Myers, Joe  Hargrove of Orange Park, Howard Schoenly of  Cape Coral, German Solar-Cortes of Orlando  and Mariette Wright of St. Augustine were also  aboard.  Sylvester Crawford  Jr.  of  Lawrenceville,  Georgia; Michael  Davidson  of Windham,  Maine; Michael Holland  of North Wilton,  Maine; Mitchell Kuflik of Brooklyn, New York;  Jeffrey Mathias of Kingston, Massachusetts;  Dylan Meklin of Rockland, Maine; Richard  Pusatere of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Danielle  Randolph of Rockland, Maine; Jeremie Riehm  of Camden, Delaware; and Steven Shultz of  Roan Mountain, Tennessee are also mourned  as  are  Piotr  Krause, Marcin  Nita,  Jan  Podgorski, Andrzej Truszkowski  and Rafal  Zdobych of Poland.  As we learn more about their lives we see  the  experience  and  professionalism  they  brought  to  their careers,  their  love of  family  and  the hope  they had  for  the  future. May  those closest to them take comfort from this  diverse collection of stories.  We also take time to recognize the United  States Coast Guard, United States Navy,  United States Air Force and other maritime assets who combined  forces  in  the search  for  the stricken ship and its members. They are to  be commended for their full commitment and  dedication to that mission.  As we move ahead, investigations are underway by the National Transportation Safety  Board and the Coast Guard to determine what  happened and how  to prevent another such  disaster from happening in the future. I have  no doubt that those answers will come. In the  meantime, America ’s maritime community is a  tight one and will rally around those who need  it the most right now—the loved ones of the  El  Faro crew. We stand with them, ready to meet  their needs  in whatever way we can,  today  and in all of the tomorrows.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF CHINESE NATIONAL DAY AND THE UNITED  STATES-TAIWAN FRIENDSHIP  HON.

411,,114,-0.428,1,2015-10-22,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  today, the House Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee will consider  a surface transportation reauthorization. Unfortunately, calling it a ‘‘reauthorization’’ doesn’t make it so.  This legislation calls for a 6-year period of reauthorization and hopes to be  funded for 3 years, but it doesn’t actually provide a single dime of revenue  from the highway trust fund. It is simply an empty shell.  It really doesn’t have to be this hard.  There is a single solution that is supported by everyone outside of Capitol  Hill, one that has been employed by six  red Republican States  already  this  year  and  championed  by  Ronald  Reagan when he was President: raise  the gas tax. Our problems are that we  are trying to fund 2015 infrastructure  with  1993 dollars—the  last  time we  raised the Federal gas tax.  I have a bill that will accomplish this  fact. H.R. 680 provides that assurance  and certainty by phasing in a gas tax  increase over 3 years. It will permit us  to fully fund a 6-year reauthorization  for the first time since 1998 without resorting to gimmicks. It is cosponsored  by over three dozen House Members,  but, more importantly, it enjoys the  broadest base of support for any major  piece of legislation before Congress.  Is there any other bill of any significance that  is endorsed by the U.S.  Chamber and the AFL–CIO, countless  business and trade associations, as well  as  individual unions,  the American  Trucking  Association,  representing  that  industry, and auto users,  represented by AAA?  The answer is ‘‘no.’’  The coalition includes bicyclists, engineers,  local  government,  transit  agencies—virtually anyone who builds,  maintains, or depends upon our transportation system.  For all the rhetoric about ‘‘strengthening the economy,’’ this will be the  one proven way of putting several million people to work at family-wage jobs  while  it  reduces  the  deficit  and  strengthens  our  communities  from  coast to coast. Every State, every metropolitan area, every rural region of  America would benefit both by  the  transportation  improvements as well  as the economic impact this work will  create.  This has been recognized by  independent analysts, editorials in major  newspapers, and in small newspapers  all across the country. There really is  no controversy.  Indeed, in the over two dozen States  that have raised transportation revenue since 2012, the  legislators who  voted for more transportation revenue  got reelected by a higher percentage  than the legislators who voted against  it. It is broadly supported, not politically controversial, and is desperately  needed.  I am glad my colleagues were able to  reach a compromise on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  and put forward some interesting ideas.  It gives a hint of what could happen if  we had a real funding source, which we  don’t; and the bill being marked up  raises more questions, therefore, than  it answers. Even if the House were to  embrace it unanimously, we would still  be where we were 3 months ago, 6  months ago, and many times before  that.  We are facing another short-term extension—this will be the 35th—and are  providing zero assurance or long-term  certainty to the many who rely on our  transportation system. No country became great building its infrastructure 8  months at a time.  We can have markups and pass a reauthorization shell on the floor of the  House; but until we embrace H.R. 680  and raise the gas tax, finding revenue  that is sustainable, dedicated, and big  enough to do the job, we are still going  to be spinning our wheels; and America  will be stuck.  f  ASHLEY MITCHELL  ",2015

413,House,114,0.59,8,2015-10-22,Mr. FLEMING.," Mr. Speaker, today I  want to give special recognition to a  special individual.  Jason Spradley was recently awarded  the Eagle Scout designation, the highest rank in the Boy Scouting program.  He is a senior at Airline High School in  Bossier City and hopes to pursue law  and become a JAG officer in the Navy.  While Jason is just 17 years old, he  has worked over a decade to reach this  Eagle Scout status. The qualifications  state a Boy Scout must earn 21 merits  to reach this level. Jason earned almost 40.  These young men earn merits by  proving their skills in camping, first  aid, and many more, but more than  learning how to fish or start a fire, Boy  Scouts learn about serving their community. Obedience, loyalty, and many  other characteristics make up what we  know to be a true leader.  The Boy Scouts motto is  ‘‘Be prepared.’’ I would say Jason and these  young men have already built a solid  foundation in their lives. I wish him,  the rest of the members in troop 105 in  Louisiana, and the many other young  men across the country who have attained Eagle Scout the very best. I  know that they all have a bright future  ahead.  f  NATIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS  WEEK  (Mr. ZINKE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2015
414,House,114,0.547,8,2015-10-22,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, last Sunday the President’s  Iranian nuclear deal, a tragic mistake,  went into effect. Instead of making the  world  safer, as promised, American  families have become less safe. As reported  in The Post and Courier of  Charleston, since the  Iran deal was  reached, the Iranian regime tested a  ballistic missile  that  could  reach  Israel, in direct violation of U.N. resolutions.  After the test of the missile, the Iranian defense minister said: ‘‘We don’t  ask permission  from anyone.’’ This  does not come as a surprise. We know  the Iranian regime cannot be trusted.  Sadly, it is shocking that the President  has dismissed the Iranian regime’s flagrant disregard of international rules  and still insists that Iran will uphold  their part of the deal.  The evidence is overwhelming that  the  Iranian  regime will  break  the  agreement, with billions of dollars for  new attacks. The President’s legacy is  American families at risk of terrorist  attacks by jihadists and a rogue regime  oppressing the people of Iran.  In conclusion, God bless our troops.  The President, by his actions, must  never forget September the 11th in the  global war on terrorism. Tomorrow is  the gruesome 32nd anniversary of the  murder of 241 Americans at the marine  barracks in Beirut by Iran.

",2015
415,Senate,114,-0.488,64,2015-10-22,Ms. HIRONO.," Mr. President, I rise  today to talk about some disappointing  news. For only the third time in 40  years,  Social  Security  beneficiaries  will not receive a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, this year. This news  will  impact  the  nearly  60 million  American  retirees,  dependent  survivors, and disabled workers who rely  on Social Security to make ends meet.  Social Security is the most effective  anti-poverty program in U.S. history.  Without Social Security, about  44.1  percent of America’s seniors would be  living in poverty.  In Hawaii, one in six residents depends on Social Security to help pay  their bills and keep a roof over their  heads. It is the only source of income  for 25 percent of our seniors in Hawaii.  We live in a world where wages just  aren’t rising fast enough, and real pensions are disappearing. More and more  workers are working longer and harder  with less to show for it when they retire.  According to a 2014 Federal Reserve  study, nearly 1 in 37 respondents reported having no retirement savings or  pensions whatsoever, pointing out once  again that Social Security benefits are  essential to millions of working Americans and retirees.  For many who are already struggling  to make ends meet, Social Security is  all they can rely on. Absent a COLA,  too many beneficiaries will see no increase in their primary source of income, making it harder to afford basic  necessities, especially medical care.  One  of  my  constituents  from  Wahiawa wrote  to me  recently and  said:  I find it incredible that there are people  who actually believe that Social Security is  too generous. The average Social Security  benefit is a whopping $14,000 a year and we’ve  only seen an average 2 percent COLA over  the past five years. I can assure you my  health care costs have far exceeded that tiny  increase.  Another constituent from Honoka’a  was more direct in her concerns. She  wrote:  I have worked very hard my entire life and  have planned to retire in a few years. My  worry is that I will not have enough money  to live. I also may have to continue to work  due to this deficit. My question is what are  you going to do about it and what is your  game plan? Year after year no one has done  anything about it and has passed it down to  the next person entering the Senate office or  Congressional office. It is a problem that  must be addressed immediately. Please help  me and the rest of my baby boomer generation.  Congress needs  to  listen  to  these  voices and act to responsibly strengthen and expand Social Security before it  becomes yet another fiscal crisis.  That is why I introduced the Protecting and Preserving Social Security  Act with Representative DEUTCH of  Florida. Our bill does two key things  that will help seniors now as well as  help to ensure the strength of Social  Security for decades to come.  First, our bill would help Social Security  recipients  by  having  basic  COLAs on a more accurate formula of  what seniors actually purchase. This  formula is called the Consumer Price  Index for the Elderly, or CPI–E. The  CPI–E more accurately recognizes the  rising costs for seniors and gives them  a benefit boost.  According to the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, if we were using the CPI–E  right now, seniors would be getting a  0.6 percent COLA increase in 2016. That  is about $100 more in benefits for the  average person on Social Security next  year. And while small, seniors tell me  that every bit counts. Changing to the  CPI–E will mean increases in Social  Security benefits to more accurately  reflect the rising costs that our seniors  experience.  Second, our bill will pay for this benefit increase by requiring millionaires  and billionaires to pay the same rate  into  the Social Security  trust  fund  that everybody else pays. Few know  that this year, once workers earned  above $118,500, they stopped paying the  payroll tax to support Social Security.  In other words, Social Security contributions are capped for these high-  wage earners.  But most workers, as we know, earn  far less than $118,500. So with every  paycheck, all year, most workers pay  into Social Security. This is not fair. It  is not fair that millionaires and billionaires get a Social Security  tax  loophole.  A corporate CEO could earn $118,500  in just one pay period and not contribute a single additional cent in payroll taxes for the rest of that year.  Our bill would gradually phase out  the cap on payments into the Social  Security trust fund over 7 years. That  way, whether you earn $50,000 or $500  million a year, you keep paying at a  fair rate to support Social Security in  every paycheck all year long.  The Protecting and Preserving Social  Security Act is a fair way to strengthen Social Security for decades to come,  and it would give current seniors and  beneficiaries  a much-needed  boost  right away.  Social Security is one of the cornerstones of the middle class and the lifeline for millions of seniors.

416,Senate,114,-0.151,78,2015-10-22,Mr. KING.," Mr. President, in support  of National Forest Products Week, I  would  like  to  recognize  the nearly  18,000 hard-working men and women  employed by the forest products industry in the great State of Maine.  Maine is home to about 40 wood products and paper manufacturing  facilities, which contribute over $900 million  to the economy through jobs and wages  and over $4 billion in industry shipments of products, making the forest  products industry one of the largest  manufacturing sectors in the State.  Our Nation’s forests are an essential  element of our urban and rural landscape. Covering more than 750 million  acres across America, they create opportunities for recreation and habitats  for wildlife, and their products play an  integral role in our daily lives.  As the only renewable building material, wood  requires  less  energy  to  transport, construct, and produce  in  comparison to alternative building materials. By increasing the use of wood  products in construction, we have the  opportunity  to  reduce  greenhouse  emissions and  improve  the environmental performance of buildings. Design and building professionals are increasingly recognizing wood’s environmental attributes and helping to create  strong markets for wood products.  The industry continues to grow and  is  taking  on  new  and  innovative  projects like the development of tall  wood buildings. Over the past several  years, a number of tall wood projects  have been completed around the world,  demonstrating successful applications  of next generation  lumber and mass  timber technologies. Today, the concept is gaining traction in the U.S.,  with more architects opting for a sustainable  solution  for attaining  safe,  cost-effective,  high-performing  tall  buildings.  Even with the advances of digital  communications, paper also continues  to play a valuable role in our daily  lives:  from  enhancing  education  through written  communications  to  capturing and preserving  life’s most  memorable moments. In my State, I  continually hear from men and women  for whom paper  is not only a preference,  but  for  some,  a  necessity.  Forty-one percent of Americans over 65  years of age do not use the internet.  Eliminating paper as an option  for  vital  government  communications—  like the IRS tax instruction manual—  impedes access to critical information  every citizen has a right to receive.  Thank you  for the opportunity to  recognize the hard-working men and  women employed by the forest products industry in Maine. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating National Forest Products Week and reflect on the positive economic, social,  and environmental impacts paper and  forest products have on our everyday  lives.

417,Senate,114,0.543,78,2015-10-22,Mr. DAINES.," Mr. President, I wish to  recognize the important role of the forest products industry as we celebrate  National Forest Products Week.  Montana’s  forests are a  treasured  part of our State’s heritage which  many of us hold so dear—not only are  Montana’s forests where we hunt, fish,  explore, and live, but our forest products  industry provides  thousands of  jobs for Montana families and a boost  to our State’s economy.  Sadly, many forest products jobs in  Montana have been lost this year in  large part due to an insufficient supply  of logs from Federal lands. I’m fighting  for commonsense reforms to restore active management across Montana so  we can get more Montanans back to  work, improve forest health, increase  access  to public  lands, and provide  much-needed sustainable revenues to  our  forested counties. These reforms  must give the Forest Service the tools  and resources it needs to increase responsible timber harvests and protect  their work from obstructionist tactics  that continue to encumber a substantial portion of the timber volume from  Montana’s national  forests. Congress  should enact these reforms swiftly.  Further, as we seek to improve the  performance  of  our  buildings,  we  should encourage the use of wood in  the construction of Federal and other  commercial  buildings. Montana  is  home to approximately 5 engineered  and panel products  facilities and 12  sawmills, millwork, and treatment facilities that employ several thousand  people across the State. These facilities are working to advance innovative  new technologies,  for example, cross  laminated timber. I am proud to have  SmartLam,  Inc.,  the very  first and  only manufacturer of cross laminated  timber, CLT, products in the U.S. located in the great State of Montana.  CLT products are creating opportunities in the U.S. to build taller wood  buildings. Advancements in new technology utilizing engineered ‘‘mass timber’’ panels are creating new possibilities for wood. This concept is gaining  momentum in the U.S. as many successful  demonstration  projects have  been built and proven to be a safe and  cost-effective solution in urban dense  settings. With more than 17 tall wood  buildings of seven stories or more having been built around the world serving  as demonstration projects, building officials, designers, contractors, and consumers are  increasingly confident  in  the safety of these buildings.  I want to thank the individuals in  the forest products industry for their  important contributions to my home  State and for their efforts to expand  tall wood building projects across the  Nation.

Dr. Williamson attended  the University of  Mississippi School of Medicine, graduating  Cum Laude in 1979. He pursued his internship  and residency at the University of Virginia, and  was certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1982.  With his education complete, Dr. Williamson  then began his long career in public health.  After serving four years as the State Tuberculosis Control Officer  in Mississippi (1982–  1986), he held a series of positions in the Alabama Department of Public Health. He began  as the Director of the Division of Disease Control (1986–1989) before serving as the Director of the Bureau of Preventive Health Services (1989–1992). On November 18, 1992, he  started his service as the head of the Department.  During his  tenure, Dr. Williamson became  known for addressing key public health issues,  such as disaster preparedness and advancing  the health of children, in the name of improving health for all Alabamians. For example, in  recent years, he led the state health efforts related to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and also  those related to the April 2011 tornadoes. He  was responsible for the design & implementation of the state’s Children’s Health Insurance  Program  (CHIP), known as ALLKIDS. This  was one of the first Children’s Health Insurance Programs in the nation and lowered the  rate of uninsured children in Alabama from 20  percent to under 7 percent. He was also intent  on doing a better job of reducing infant mortality and  increasing children’s  immunization  rates.  I wish Dr. Williamson all the very best as he  steps down  from  the Department of Public  Health and moves into his new role as president of  the Alabama Hospital Association.  I  know that he will bring fresh insight to the Association and carry  the organization  to new  heights. I look forward to working with him in  this new position.

Marian  High School is a great school, and the  team, the coach, the teachers, and the  entire student body should be proud  today. I want to recognize the parents,  who sacrifice so much for their kids to  play in sports programs.  The achievement that this is today is  something these students will have for  a lifetime. On behalf of the people of  the Second Congressional District of  the State of Indiana, I applaud Coach  Householter and the entire team for  their determination and hard work. I  congratulate them all on an amazing  season.  f  NEW STARTS AND SMALL STARTS  PROGRAM  (Ms. KUSTER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2015
423,House,114,-0.256,10,2015-11-04,Ms. KUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, today I  rise in support of the Federal Transit  Administration’s New Starts and Small  Starts program, which provides critical  grant funding for the creation or extension of existing fixed guideway transit  systems.  Funding for these projects has facilitated the creation of dozens of new or  extended public transportation systems  in rural, suburban, and urban communities all across this country.  By  creating good-paying  construction  jobs and connecting  job-seeking  commuters with employers, New Starts  offers significant benefits to communities that are in need of rail expansion.  In New Hampshire and across New  England, we have been working collaboratively  with  our  neighboring  States to create a unified vision for our  region’s rail networks.  I was pleased to host a rail summit  just a few weeks ago that brought together regional stakeholders and officials from the Federal Railroad Administration, the FTA, and New England  States.  As we continue to work on the highway bill this week,  I urge my colleagues to support Congressmen LIPINSKI, NADLER, and DOLD’s amendment,  which will restore much-needed local  flexibility for New Start projects.  f  NORTH CAROLINA HAS LOST A  FAVORITE SON  (Mr. WALKER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

When we go back home to our districts, a lot of times we are on the tail  end of jokes, being Congressmen and  Congresswomen, and sometimes they  talk about us being a little slow.  So let me go over the facts one more  time  for the gentleman  from South  Carolina. The Bank doesn’t cost the  taxpayer a penny. We are doing more  in the way of reforms than since President Reagan. It returns $500 million to  $1 billion a year back to the Treasury.  Now, I know that they have taken  the position to kill the Bank, but this  kills jobs. This is about jobs in Tennessee, jobs in California, jobs in Oklahoma, jobs in Illinois.

431,House,114,-0.342,80,2015-11-04,Mr. SHERMAN.," Mr. Chairman, I have  tremendous respect for the author and  his intention here, but any amendment  to the Ex-Im title means the Ex-Im  title is open to the conference, which  will kill the Ex-Im Bank. So we should  not adopt an amendment that mostly  restates existing law. We have, already,  provisions which  prevent  the Bank  from financing state sponsors of terrorism.  First, the Bank’s own charter, which  I helped draft, prohibits them from extending loans or any assistance to any  entity that violates U.S. sanctions.  Second, as the gentleman points out,  the Foreign Assistance Act prohibits  any aid to state sponsors of terrorism  but allows for a Presidential waiver,  but that is a national security waiver,  which is very limited.  I commend the gentleman  for his  amendment because it has caused the  Ex-Im Bank to issue, just an hour ago,  a pledge not to seek any waiver under  any circumstances that they can concurrently conceive of.  But third, and most importantly, the  last 10 appropriations bills have an absolute ban on the Ex-Im Bank helping  state sponsors of terror, and there is no  waiver allowed. Now, I would like the  next omnibus bill, which already has  this provision in it, to have the gentleman’s language in it as well, and I look  forward to working on that.  NOVEMBER4, 2015.  Re: Letter Concerning Prohibitions Related  to State Sponsors of Terrorism.  Hon. FREDP. HOCHBERG,  Chairman and President, Export Import Bank of  the United States, Washington, DC.  DEARCHAIRMANHOCHBERG: Thank you for  your  letter outlining the position of the  Bank in opposition to support for exports to  countries designated state sponsors of terrorism.  As we have discussed, there may be an effort to sell or lease civilian aircraft to Iran  Air or other Iranian airlines, and that there  may be efforts to secure export credit agency  support for such sales or leases. I am therefore grateful for your acknowledgement that  there is no scenario that you currently foresee where a Presidential Waiver would be  sought to provide loans for export of any  items to these countries or any person from  those countries.  I understand, of course, that unforeseen  and even bizarre circumstances may arise in  international affairs; but given the current  state of our relations with these countries, I  am pleased to hear that you cannot anticipate any scenario where we would provide  Ex-Im Bank assistance to state sponsors of  terrorism.  Sincerely,  BRADSHERMAN,  Member of Congress.  NOVEMBER4, 2015.  Hon. BRADSHERMAN,  House of Representatives, Washington, DC.  DEARCONGRESSMANSHERMAN: Pursuant to  applicable law, the Export-Import Bank of  the United States does not  finance any  transactions for designated state sponsors of  terrorism. As you know, transactions involving the three existing state sponsors of terrorism—the Republic of Sudan, the Islamic  Republic of Iran, and the Syrian Arab Republic—are already subject to numerous additional restrictions. As Chairman and President of  the Export-Import Bank of  the  United States, I do not anticipate any scenario in which the Bank would seek a waiver  from the President of the United States as  contemplated by (i) section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371), or  (ii) the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C.  2780(g)), in connection with a transaction involving a country designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, or any transaction involving any person from any such countries.

434,Senate,114,-0.312,150,2015-11-04,Mr. MURPHY.," I thank Senator DURBINvery much.  This article is a few years old, but it  underscores his point. Here is the opening line of an article from CNBC on  this question of salaries for the CEOs  of  for-profit universities. The article  opens by saying: ‘‘Forget Wall Street  and Silicon Valley. If you’re looking to  rake  it  in post-graduation, set your  sights on the executive floor at one of  the nation’s for-profit colleges.’’  That is an article from CNBC detailing the fact that in their article—again  this is a few years old—the salary of  the head of Phoenix University was $11  million, and the CEO of Bridgepoint,  another national for-profit university,  was making over $20 million a year.  You can say to yourself: These are  private,  for-profit  companies. Why  should Congress be in the business of  caring what the CEO of Phoenix University makes or what  the CEO of  Bridgepoint or ITT or DeVry makes?  Harry Truman made his name as a  critic of wartime profiteering. LBJ  made his name as a young Member of  Congress doing the same. Their idea  was that it is all well and good to make  yourself rich in the most dynamic capitalist economy in the world, but it is  another thing to be getting rich off the  taxpayers. It is another thing to be  making your  fortune almost  exclusively coming from sources of money  that really is all of our constituents’  money in the form of the taxes they  pay.  That is what we are talking about  today. What we are talking about are  executives who are getting rich off of  companies that are 90 percent funded  by the U.S. taxpayer because this 90–10  rule we talked about is an important  rule  for  these companies. They  run  their revenue right up to the limit. So  for many of these  for-profit universities, their revenue is 70, 80, 90 percent  from  the  taxpayers  of  the United  States, and their CEOs are making $11  million, $12 million, sometimes $20 million a year.  Listen, I am all for people making a  million dollars. I have a lot of people in  Connecticut who are making $20 million, but if we are being good stewards  of the taxpayers’ dollars, we should be  wary of those who are making their  fortune off of the Federal dole. That is  what is happening today.  Senator DURBIN, I just wanted to add  in this conversation a note of accountability. That is one of the things that  used to unite Republicans and Democrats. Frankly,  the Republicans,  I  admit,  cared more  about  accountability in Federal dollars than sometimes the Democrats did. It was the  Republicans in the second Bush administration who started attaching strings  to education dollars that were flowing  out of Washington to make sure there  was actually quality attached to the  money that was coming from U.S. Federal taxpayers, but that era seems to  be over.  Unfortunately, we don’t have a bipartisan consensus on accountability. We  are about to approve a budget that a  lot of Republicans and a lot of Democrats will vote for that will send $140  billion in higher education aid to universities all across this country. It will  come with almost no strings attached.  It will come with almost no expectations that schools give a degree to kids  that will actually get them a job or attempt to keep them in school so they  can get some return on investment for  the money we are all paying to them.  Senator,  you might  have  talked  about it already today, but the numbers of  for-profit colleges  that  just  came out today are absolutely stunning. I don’t know if you talked about  the  ‘‘Trends  in Student Aid’’ report  that just came out today from the College Board.  Here is an amazing statistic. What  this survey says is that borrowers who  don’t graduate from public and private  nonprofit  4-year  schools  default  at  about the same rate as borrowers who  do graduate  from  for-profit  schools.  Think about that. You are just as likely to not be able to pay back your student loan if you get a degree from a  for-profit school as if you had dropped  out of a not-for-profit school.  Here are the numbers: 14 percent of  for-profit graduates default; 15 percent  of not-for-profit  4-year  college nongraduates default. That  is a  really  stunning number. Yet we are just sending money willy-nilly out  to  these  schools that are not putting students  in degrees. Why are they not putting  students in degrees? Because they are  marketing themselves in a way that  just does not square with the job market today.  As part of one of these attorney general lawsuits—there is a litany of stories about the abusive marketing techniques of these for-profit universities.  One of them said: I told the enrollment  representative  that  I did not  want to sign the  loan unless I was  guaranteed a job because I knew that I  would not be able to pay it back. She  told me that the school placed 99 percent of the students and they could  guarantee a  job after I  finished my  externship. She told me that I would be  making between $18 and $20 an hour  after completing the program. No worries about the loan. She told me career  services could place me in a job and  that she makes sure everybody who enrolls gets placed.  These are the claims that are being  made. So it is frankly not surprising,  when you have these for-profit universities enrolling thousands of kids  in  video game design degrees, that you  are just as likely to default on a loan  if you graduate  from some of those  worthless programs as  if you don’t  graduate from a not-for-profit university.  So last Congress, Senator SCHATZand  I, joined by Senator MURRAYand Senator SANDERS,  introduced a piece of  legislation that would start to require  some real outcomes from universities.  We applied it to for-profit and not-for-  profit universities. We said: You have  to show that you are giving kids a  chance to succeed and get a job, that  you are keeping your tuition at reasonable levels. If you do that, then you  can continue to get title IV dollars.  But if they don’t, we are not going to  continue  to  send money  to  these  schools that simply are not producing  graduates who are ready to compete or  that are deceptively drawing students  in based on claims that just do not  wash out in the end.  So, yes, we have to shut down these  fraudulent  institutions  like  Corinthian. But we could just make a decision, Republicans and Democrats, to  put  some  additional  accountability  standards on title IV dollars, apply it  to for-profit and not-for-profit schools,  and say: If you have a certain number  of students who are defaulting, you are  not going to continue to get title IV  dollars. If you have a rate of tuition increase that is way above that of the national average, you are not going to  continue to get title IV dollars.  We know  by  statistics  that  this  would put a good number of for-profits  out of business. It might even touch a  handful of the lower performing not-  for-profits. But it should be something  on which both sides can come together,  just  some  basic  accountability  for  higher  education,  a  basic  accountability for the $140 billion we send, because this does not make sense. It does  not make sense to pad the pockets of  these CEOs who are making $20 million  a year off of our taxpayers when they  are not delivering results that are actually making our economy better.

Since 1985,  this organization has been  dedicated  to building quality and affordable  housing for families from all walks of life, offering an opportunity for families who are otherwise unable  to obtain proper  financing  to  achieve their dream of homeownership.  In order to qualify for a home, families must  contribute five hundred hours on the construction of their or someone else’s home, which in  turn fosters a sense of ownership and a greater sense of unity in the community. In the last  year alone, the organization built fourteen new  homes and renovated almost a dozen others,  providing a better  living  situation  for over  eighty adults and children.  This positive impact on the lives of families  would not have been possible without the vision and devotion that Habitat for Humanity of  Tacoma and Pierce County and its countless  volunteers have shown. They have played a  key  role  in making Pierce County a better  place  to  live—both  for  their clients and  the  community at large.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I recognize the work of Habitat for Humanity of Tacoma and Pierce County on their thirtieth anniversary as a positive contributor to the community. Their commitment to lifting up the lives  of so many Pierce County families over three  decades  is admirable and  I  look  forward  to  their future positive impacts.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  MONTGOMERY  EMANCIPATION OBSERVANCES  HON.

This  is a  remarkable accomplishment  for  Drs. Sancar and Modrich and for the universities and researchers who support their work.  As a UNC graduate and a former Duke professor,  I am especially  thrilled with  the announcement.  Drs. Sancar and Modrich were awarded the  prize  in  recognition of  their work with Dr.  Thomas Lindhal of Britain on DNA mismatch  repair. The consensus of the scientific community is that this is critically important work that  could pave the way for innovative new treatments for cancer and other diseases.  Dr. Aziz Sancar is the Sarah Graham Kenan  Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at  the University of North Carolina School of  Medicine. A native of Savur-Mardin, Turkey  and the first Turkish-American Member of the  National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Sancar  runs the Sancar Lab at UNC, directing the university’s biomedical research. He has called  North Carolina home since 1982, and he and  his wife Gwen created the Turkish House in  Chapel Hill and are spearheading efforts  to  create a permanent Turkish Center at UNC.  Dr. Paul Modrich is the James B. Duke Professor of Biochemistry at Duke University and  a Member of  the Duke Cancer  Institute. He  has  been  an  investigator  at  the Howard  Hughes Medical Institute for over 20 years. He  heads the Modrich Lab, which has been responsible for a number of major innovations in  cancer and biomedical research. He has been  at Duke since 1976.  This announcement is another important reminder that Congress must renew its commitment  to  research and  innovation. Roughly,  two-thirds of our nation ’s basic research is directly supported by federal agencies. Federal  funding from the NIH and CDC provides researchers with critical financial support, and it  is one of the most important investments we  can make both for public health and the economy. Biomedical research alone creates millions of jobs and adds two dollars to the economy  for every dollar  invested. We must reverse the shortsighted cuts to research funding imposed by Congress in recent years and  once again make robust  investments  in  the  sort of research conducted by Drs. Modrich  and Sancar.  I join with well-wishers from North Carolina  and around  the world  to  congratulate Dr.  Modrich and Dr. Sancar on their historic accomplishment, and I am proud that these two  world-class leaders in biomedical research call  the Triangle home.  f  HONORING TURLOCK CITY  MANAGER ROY WASDEN  HON.

437,,114,-0.419,171,2015-11-04,Mrs. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, on November  8th, I will attend the commemoration services  for Sir Michael Berry; an icon and leader in  the Michigan community. Michael Berry was a  son, a devoted father, a loving husband, and  a pioneer in the community.  Sir Michael Berry graduated from Fordson  Junior College and Wayne College and  in  1949, he became the first Muslim American to  become a practicing attorney in the State of  Michigan. He  then  formed a  legal practice  Berry, Hopson & Francis with his associates.  In 1967, he won election to the Wayne County  Road Commission, where he served for sixteen years,  ten of which, he served as  the  chairman. Sir Michael Berry used his energy  and enthusiasm  to always give back  to  the  community. He endowed a scholarship at the  MSU College of Law, and he gave generously  to so many of our great local universities, hospitals, and cultural institutions. Believing that  education is a key to success, he was pivotal  in  the creation of  the Michael Berry Career  Center at  the Dearborn Public schools and  worked  tireless  to  improve access  to education for our children.  Sir Michael Berry gave so much to the community over  the years, without ever asking  anything in return for himself. His hard work  and continuous  involvement with  the Detroit  Metro Airport inspired the Airport Authority to  name  the Berry  international  terminal  in his  honor. He was awarded the Ellis Island Medal  of Honor  from  the National Ethnic Coalition  Organization and was given the Knight of the  National Order of the Cedar of Lebanon which  is considered one of  the highest and most  prestigious awards for his humanitarian aid to  his homeland, and for which, he came to be  called Sir Michael Berry.  Perhaps the most lasting legacy that Sir Michael Berry  leaves  is  on  the  people  he  mentored and people he loved. He was an activist, a mentor, and advisor  to many. He  helped mold several generations of educators,  elected officials, attorneys, and other professionals. In our community, he was considered  an icon, but to his family he was known as a  loving husband,  father, brother, grandfather  and great-grandfather. Based on the values of  hard work, faith, and love, I know that his family will proudly carry on his legacy into the future.  Mr. Speaker, Sir Michael Berry lived a life  worth celebrating. No words can ease the loss  that is felt by his family or this community, but  we take solace in the knowledge that his example will live on for many generations. I ask  my colleagues  today  to honor Sir Michael  Berry on his extraordinary life and accomplishments.  f  OUTSTANDING TEACHER IN KATY,  TEXAS  HON.

438,House,114,-0.438,10,2015-11-16,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentlewoman for yielding,  and I also thank her for her leadership  as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit of  the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure.  This past week, our Nation paused to  honor the extraordinary service of our  Nation’s veterans. The foundation of  America’s military is not ships or missiles, and it isn’t tanks or jets. The  foundation of our military is the men  and women who voluntarily serve, the  ones who give their blood, sweat, and  tears to make sure that we have the  freedom that we experience every day.  Too often those who have served our  country, particularly after the terrible  events of 9/11, have faced significant  challenges  finding  civilian  employment. Earlier this year, the Bureau of  Labor Statistics released a report on  veterans’ employment in 2014. According to the BLS, last year there were  more than 21 million men and women  who had served in our Armed Forces,  or approximately 9 percent of our civilian population.  The BLS found that in 2014 the jobless rate for all veterans was 5.3 percent, while the unemployment rate for  veterans who had served since 9/11 was  7.2 percent. The BLS also found that  the unemployment rate for veterans in  my home State of Maryland was 8.5  percent,  the  highest  among  all  50  States.  According to data drawn  from the  Census Bureau’s Survey of Business  Owners in 2007, there were nearly 21⁄2  million businesses in the United States  of which veterans comprised the majority ownership. Together, these businesses had receipts of approximately  $1.2 trillion. Nearly half a million of  these businesses were also employers,  with a combined annual payroll of approximately $210 billion.  Now,  I agree with Representative  FITZPATRICKthat we must expand programs that help veterans find employment after their service ends and that  we should expand contracting opportunities in the highway and transit programs for small businesses owned by  veterans. I just don’t think adding veterans to the existing DBE program is  the  right way  to accomplish  these  goals.  Adding  veteran-owned  small  businesses to the DBE program would force  the veteran-owned businesses to compete with disadvantaged business enterprises already participating in the  program for contracting opportunities.  The best way to help veterans is to establish a Federal participation goal  that is specifically for veteran-owned  small businesses and business concerns  separate and apart from the DBE program.  b1600  Today I and several of my colleagues  introduced  legislation  to accomplish  just that. Our bill, H.R. 3997, would  amend the MAP–21 program to create a  10 percent aspirational goal  for veteran-owned small-business concerns.

439,House,114,0.689,38,2015-11-16,Mr. BRIDENSTINE.," Mr. Speaker, I  am  fully convinced of the potential  economic growth and innovation the  commercial space industry represents.  We already rely on commercial space  for so much, and in the coming years,  we will see this industry continuing to  expand worldwide  Internet coverage,  advanced  communication  architectures, remote sensing and weather architectures, affordable access to space  for science and commerce, permanent  habitats in space, utilization of space  resources, and the list goes on.  We must make sure that we as members of Congress do not do anything  that could stifle this world-changing  industry. That is why the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness  Act is crucial. The most important aspect of this legislation is the extension  of the so-called learning period or moratorium on regulations for commercial  human spaceflight. We need a learning  period so we can eventually create a  regulatory environment based on real  data, not just speculation.  The bill also extends launch indemnification  to keep American  space  companies competitive against  international companies, clarifies  that a  launch license and experimental permit can be issued for the same design,  and enables private companies to explore and mine celestial resources by  incorporating the Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015 introduced by my friends BILLPOSEYand  DEREKKILMERhere in this body. These  provisions will go a long way toward  encouraging a continued growth of the  commercial space industry.  I would also like to address a few provisions of this bill that I worked to include myself, and I am pleased that we  were able to keep them as the Senate  worked to keep them in the final bill.  Section 116 of the bill will require a  GAO report to capture the role of space  support vehicles  in  the  commercial  space industry, regulatory and statutory barriers to the services these vehicles offer, and recommendations for updates that will address these barriers.  People will need to be trained to fly,  and vehicle designs will not remain  static, which is why this provision is so  important. This section will help us address situations that will become more  prevalent as the commercial space industry continues to expand and diversify.  Additionally, title II of this bill incorporates H.R. 2261, the Commercial  Remote Sensing Act, bipartisan legislation  I  introduced with my  friend  from Colorado, EDPERLMUTTER. This  title sets metrics to give Congress a  full picture of the workload facing the  Department of Commerce when licensing remote-sensing activities and what  issues are preventing them from meeting statutory deadlines. Title II also  recognizes the importance of seeking  input from the Advisory Committee for  Commercial Remote Sensing, which is  largely made up of industry representatives. This legislation will be crucial as  industry  expands beyond  traditional  remote-sensing satellites and activities  and as Congress looks to update the  statutes governing these activities for  the first time since the 1990s.  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I would  like to thank the majority leader, Mr.  MCCARTHY, the sponsor of this legislation, and the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee  chairman,  Mr.  SMITH, for their continued leadership  on commercial space issues.

451,,114,-0.438,101,2015-11-16,Mr. CUMMINGS.," Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman SHUSTERand Ranking Member DEFAZIO  for working with me on both of my amendments.  The amendment  I offer would require  the  Department of Transportation to submit a report  to  the House Transportation Committee  and the Senate Commerce Committee on research managed by the Federal Railroad Administration  (FRA)  to develop a system  to  measure vertical track deflection caused by a  moving railroad car.  Such a system should be able to identify a  combination of factors that, individually, may  not be able  to cause a  train derailment but  that, together, could endanger safe train operations, such as deteriorated cross ties, fouled  ballast, and other deficiencies in the structures  that support rail tracks.  The amendment authorizes the Department  of Transportation to develop a plan for using  quantitative inspection criteria to identify poor  track support systems if such an approach is  supported by the FRA’s research.  The amendment also authorizes the Department to develop a plan to install instruments  to measure track deflection on its Automated  Track Inspection Program geometry cars within 3 years of the date of enactment of this bill,  if this approach is supported by the FRA’s research.  I developed this amendment in very close  consultation with the families of Rose Louese  Mayr and Elizabeth Conway Nass, who were  tragically killed in a coal train derailment that  occurred in Ellicott City, Maryland, in my district, in 2012.  These families have worked tirelessly to understand the technical circumstances that led  to  the 2012  train derailment and  to  identify  specific steps that can be taken to prevent future tragedies. I am deeply honored to have  worked with them on this amendment.  According  to  the National Transportation  Safety Board’s (NTSB) report on  the Ellicott  City accident, ‘ ‘the point of derailment was a  rail  fracture several hundred  feet’ ’ before a  bridge. After extensive laboratory analysis, the  NTSB concluded that the broken rail segment,  ‘showed evidence of rolling contact fatigue, a  gradual breakdown of the rail-head surface.’ ’  The Ellicott City accident is one of several  recent accidents that have involved rail-head  wear and drawn attention to the ways in which  the presence of multiple individual defects can  eventually lead to a rail break.  While track conditions are addressed in current Federal Track Safety Standards, there are  no  quantitative  inspection  criteria.  Consequently, these conditions are rarely cited as  defects to be remediated.  I hope that we can build on the research  foundation that my amendment requires and  eventually develop rules that will address specific track conditions.  f  HIRE MORE HEROES ACT OF 2015  SPEECHOF  HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 3, 2015  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the state of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 22) to amend the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt employees  with  health  coverage  under  TRICARE or the Veterans Administration  from being taken into account for purposes  of determining the employers to which the  employer mandate applies under the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act:  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chair,  it  is a sad  commentary on the state of this House that  the highway bill we are considering is being  called a victory, and  that  the mere act of  bringing a bill to the floor is a major step forward.  As a nation with a D+ grade on infrastructure from the American Society for Civil Engineers, we need an ambitious plan to rebuild  and modernize. We need to invest in transit,  fix structurally-deficient bridges, connect people to jobs, and move goods across the country. We need to put people to work in every  community bringing our transportation system  into the 21st century. That’s why I introduced  a version of the President’s GROW America  Act that would have invested more in our infrastructure.  Instead, we are considering a very modest  proposal. It’s a six year bill at current funding  levels adjusted  for  inflation, with only  three  years of funding. The pay-fors include bad and  inefficient policies like hiring private debt collectors  to harass  taxpayers.  It dramatically  cuts the TIFIA loan program and fails to provide adequate funding for transit. And it needlessly erodes environmental and community  review of projects.  This bill does have some positive provisions  providing  resources  for major projects, continuing funding for bike-ped and Safe Routes  to School, and strengthening Buy American  requirements. I appreciate that my amendment  to allow communities  to protect consumers  from predatory  towing has been  included  in  the bill. And I strongly support reauthorization  of  the Export-Import Bank  to open up  international markets for American goods.  But I am disappointed that this bill does not  go farther to improve and transform our transportation networks. As we begin conference  negotiations with the Senate, we must significantly boost  investments, eliminate problematic offsets, and restore meaningful project review.  f  ROTARY CLUB OF WICHITA FALLS,  TEXAS CELEBRATES  100 YEARS  OF SERVICE  HON. MAC THORNBERRY  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, November 16, 2015  ",2015
452,,114,0.529,101,2015-11-16,Mr. THORNBERRY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to congratulate the Rotary Club of Wichita Falls, Texas, on its milestone of providing  100 years of service inside and outside of our  community.  The Rotary Club of Wichita Falls consists of  90 dedicated men and women who make a  difference on  the  local, national, and  international  level. The Club ’s motto  is  ‘Service  Above Self,’ ’ and  this organization certainly  abides by this statement with its many service  projects and support for numerous organizations  throughout  the Wichita Falls area and  beyond.  The wide variety of organizations supported  by the Club includes the Boy Scouts, YMCA,  Youth Leadership, and  the Boys and Girls  Club.  In  fact,  the Boys and Girls Club has  maintained a connection to the Rotary Club for  an impressive 86 years and continues to flourish with its support. These programs provide  needed growth and  leadership opportunities  for developing future leaders. The Club also  plays a key role in a variety of adult programs,  which includes the Adult Literacy Council, The  Food Bank, American Red Cross, Habitat for  Humanity, and  the Salvation Army,  just  to  name a few.  Additionally,  the Wichita Falls Rotary Club  provides many  services  and  support  for  Sheppard Air Force Base (AFB), a base that  plays a key role in training and equipping U.S.  Air Force personnel. A highly notable program  is  the Squadron Adoption Program with  the  goal to establish and maintain exemplary relations between  the permanent party military  stationed at Sheppard AFB and the proactive  leadership  of  the  communities  throughout  Wichita County. Units  from both  the 82nd  Training Wing and  the 80th Flying Training  Wing participate in this program. Groups like  the Rotary Club play an important role in ensuring our military receives  the support and  gratitude they deserve. The Rotary Club also  helps  remind us  that our country  remains  strong because of the sacrifice made by our  men and women in the military.  Another important program the Rotary Club  has adopted is the flag project, which consists  of Rotary members placing American  flags  around  the City of Wichita Falls. With  this  project alone, the Club has managed to raise  and donate approximately $700,000  to  local  and worldwide Rotary projects.

453,,114,-0.576,108,2015-11-16,Ms. BASS.," Mr. Speaker, today I recognize  and celebrate 50 years and community  improvement in Watts and South Los Angeles,  California, under the inspiration and leadership  of Sweet Alice Harris.  Sweet Alice, as she  is universally known,  began speaking up against the health disparities and lack of access to services that she  saw  in her neighborhood  five decades ago.  She  founded  the  organization Parents  of  Watts  to give voice  to  those who were no  longer willing to accept the circumstances in  which  they  found  themselves and  their children after decades of civic neglect. Parents of  Watts provided a platform for community organizing and self-empowerment.  Watts and greater South Los Angeles might  be a very different place without Sweet Alice  Harris. Fifty years ago she began clearly and  effectively  insisting  that  her  children,  her  neighbors and her community should have the  same access to education, health care, safety  and employment  that others have. Through  her unrelenting, focused advocacy, her effective story-telling, and her development of relationships with both the neediest and the most  powerful  in Los Angeles, she has  improved  the quality of life for people well beyond her  immediate reach.  I offer my personal thanks and congratulations to Sweet Alice on 50 years of service. I  remember the founding of Parents of Watts,  an organization that has grown to provide an  array of services to a diverse segment of the  community,  including  emergency  food  and  shelter for the homeless, college preparation  for  teenagers, drug counseling, health seminars and parenting classes. I am pleased that  this work has been recognized over the years,  including by Essence Magazine, the California  Lieutenant Governor ’s Woman of  the Year  Award, the Minerva Award from the California  Governor  &  First  Lady’s  Conference  on  Women, President George H. W. Bush’s #702  Points of Light Award, and an honorary Doctor  of Humane Letters  from  the University of  Southern California.  With a list of accomplishments too lengthy  to list here, her greatest success is that her  work will continue to benefit Watts and South  Los Angeles for the foreseeable future. It is an  honor to recognize her work.  f  HONORING  VIETNAM  VETERANS  OF AMERICA, LUCIO G. MORENO,  CHAPTER 574  HON. BETO O’ROURKE  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, November 16, 2015  Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor Chapter 574 of the Vietnam Veterans of  America (VVA) for their service to our country  and support of Vietnam War Veterans, including those in El Paso. The Lucio G. Moreno  Chapter has worked to assure that these veterans and  their  families are not  forgotten  in  my district.  Named in honor of lifelong El Pasoan and  United States Marine Corps Veteran Lucio G.  Moreno, Chapter 574 expanded under Mr.  Moreno’s fifteen years of leadership as President. The chapter is now the second largest in  Texas  and  has  advocated  for  improved  healthcare access  for our service members  and veterans.  Chapter 574 is an active force in our local  community and the State of Texas. The Lucio  G. Moreno Chapter held  the Texas State  Council convention for 37 VVA state chapters  earlier  this year, providing a space  for Veterans  to gather and discuss current  issues  facing veterans today such as reform efforts  within the VA and access to benefits. The organization regularly performs color guard duty  at my Town Hall meetings and volunteers their  time to support local high school ROTC programs throughout El Paso.  The chapter has also worked  to create a  more  welcoming  environment  for  service  members returning home. These Vietnam Veterans felt that their own homecoming and readjustment was difficult; they strive to ensure  that ‘ ‘never again will one generation of veterans abandon another. ’ ’  I am honored  to  recognize  the Lucio G.  Moreno Chapter 574 of Vietnam Veterans of  America and their work to diligently serve our  community and our veterans.  f  HONORING CPL. ARNOLD ABEL  HON. TODD C.

455,House,114,0.563,20,2015-11-30,Mr. YODER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  honor the service and sacrifice of one  of my constituents and my friend, Donald R. Boyer, who passed away on November 21, 2015.  Don was a World War  II veteran,  fought bravely  in the Battle of the  Bulge, was captured by German forces,  and spent many months as a prisoner  of war, for which he was awarded the  Purple Heart.  After World War II, Don worked for  the Chrysler Corporation as a zone real  estate manager for 27 years. Throughout his career, Don found several ways  to continue to serve our Nation and fellow veterans.  He was commander of Post 370 and  Second District  commander  of  the  American Legion, trustee of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 846, and was  serving as local chapter commander of  the American Ex-Prisoners  of War  when he unfortunately passed away.  Don also served on my Veterans Advisory Committee  for more  than  5  years, providing great insight to issues  involving our Armed Forces, veterans,  and their families.  Mr. Speaker, without Don’s service  and sacrifice, along with all the men  and women of the Greatest Generation,  our Nation would not be as resilient  and flourishing as it is today, and we  remain ever thankful for their service.  f  EMBRACE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Dr. Kelley’s continuous progression within  the education community from his time as a  teacher at Inter-Lakes Elementary School, to  his most recent position as Principal of Inter-  Lakes Elementary School,  exemplifies  his  dedication and professionalism, and I know he  will remain an exceptional role model for students and faculty throughout New Hampshire.  The creativity, knowledge, and experience  Dr. Kelley brought to schools throughout the  Granite State has been  invaluable, and  it’s  clear he leaves an example of strong leadership for others to emulate in his wake.  It is with great admiration that I congratulate  Mr. Kelley on his retirement, and wish him the  best on all future endeavors.  f  TRIBUTE TO PUEBLO EAST HIGH  SCHOOL  AND  BAYFIELD  HIGH  SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAMS  HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON  OFCOLORADO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 8, 2015  ",2015
490,,114,0.455,117,2015-12-08,Mr. TIPTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor both the Pueblo East High School and  Bayfield High School football teams, who are  the 2015 Colorado State Football champions  of the Colorado High School Athletic Association’s 3A and 2A divisions, respectively.  The Pueblo East Eagles defeated the Roosevelt Rough Riders, in a 57 –30 rout in front  of their fans at Dutch Clark Stadium in Pueblo,  Colorado. With  this victory,  the Eagles are  now back-to-back State champions, making  them the latest in what is a long line of powerhouse high school  football  teams  from  the  Steel City. The season began with East losing  to a team they had beaten a year before, but  their resiliency  in  the  face of adversity saw  them win 12 consecutive games en route to  the state title, and making the Eagles Pueblo ’s  only high school  football  team  to have ever  won consecutive state football championships.  The Bayfield Wolverines traveled to Kersey,  Colorado and capped their perfect season with  a hard  fought 28–20 victory over  the Platte  Valley High School Broncos, winning their first  state championship in football since 1996. The  last  time Bayfield High School won a state  championship in any sport was back in 2005,  making this victory that much sweeter, and ensuring  that  the players and coaches of  this  season can look back and be proud of their  hard work which ended the drought.  Mr. Speaker, the Pueblo East Eagles and  the Bayfield Wolverines deserve a tremendous  amount of recognition for their hard work. A  football season in Colorado is filled with long  trips over diverse terrain to play unfamiliar opponents,  injuries, and  the unpredictable elements  that Colorado weather provides. With  exceptional displays of grit and determination  throughout their seasons, the Eagles and the  Wolverines have brought an immense amount  of pride to the Third Congressional District of  Colorado. I am honored to represent these exceptional high schools and congratulate them  for their recent accomplishments.  f  HONORING DR. GREGORY L.  EASTWOOD  HON. JOHN KATKO  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 8, 2015  ",2015
491,,114,0.208,117,2015-12-08,Mr. KATKO.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to  honor  the  retirement  of Dr. Gregory  L.  Eastwood who served as President of  the  State University of New York Upstate Medical  University from January 1, 1993 until June 2,  2006. At the time, Dr. Eastwood ’s tenure was  noted as one of the longest in the history of  the  institution and  the  longest of all sitting  presidents of the State University of New York  State Operated campuses. Dr. Eastwood kindly answered  the call  to return  to  the President ’s seat in October 2013 when the campus  was in need of experienced and capable leadership. Dr. Eastwood will now say farewell to  the presidency of Upstate Medical University  as he retires this year.  Dr. Eastwood currently serves on the SUNY  Upstate Medical University Foundation Board  of Directors. Dr. Eastwood teaches the Ethical,  Legal, and Social Issues in Medicine course  and the Clinical Bioethics course in the College  of Medicine  at SUNY Upstate. Dr.  Eastwood also teaches ethics courses for the  College of Graduate Studies, College of Nursing, and College of Health Professions. Dr.  Eastwood has authored over 130 articles and  book chapters and has written and edited several books. Dr. Eastwood has served the Central New York community for years with distinction,  holding  leadership  roles  and  partnering with many different organizations in  the region.  During Dr. Eastwood’s first tenure as President he advanced an aggressive vision for the  Upstate Medical University Campus which has  fostered the growth of the clinical enterprise  through  the establishment of  the University  Health Care Center, the Joslin Diabetes Center,  and  an  expansion  that  included  the  Golisano Children’s Hospital. He also supported the educational mission of the campus  by supporting a new College of Medicine curriculum,  the establishment of  the Center  for  Bioethics and Humanities, and many other  projects  that supported  the educational mission of  the campus. During Dr. Eastwood’s  second  tenure he  revamped SUNY Upstate  Medical University’s  relationship with SUNY  Central  Administration  and  undertook  all  projects with the explicit goal of leaving the institution in a better place for the next President.  Dr. Gregory L. Eastwood has had a remarkable  career,  serving at multiple prominent  medical schools and  influencing  the medical  community with his participation on countless  organizations’  boards  and  committees. Dr.  Eastwood has served the SUNY Upstate community and the medical community honorably  and he will be missed greatly. On behalf of the  entire Central New York community, I would  like to thank Dr. Eastwood for his passion and  dedication  to a community  that greatly  respects him and is stronger now because of his  work.  f  HONORING  PRINCIPAL  STEVE  HOPE  FOR  THE  2015  INDIANA  PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR  HON. JACKIE WALORSKI  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 8, 2015  ",2015
492,,114,-0.378,124,2015-12-08,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and accomplishments of Ted B.  Wahby, who passed away on Saturday, December 5, 2015. He was a warm friend who  leaves a legacy of superb public service in its  best sense. He will be deeply, personally  missed by so many of us privileged to work  hand-in-hand, and I am honored to pay tribute  to his remarkable life accomplishments.  Ted Wahby was a pillar in the City of St.  Clair Shores, Macomb County and the greater  region  for over 50 years. He and his wife  Yvonne moved to St. Clair Shores in 1964 and  raised six children  there. The Wahby  family  planted strong  roots  in  the city as  faithful  members of St. Margaret of Scotland Catholic  Church and  the Shorewood Kiwanis. During  this time Ted embarked upon a successful career working at Comerica Bank, serving in numerous high-level capacities for 31 years, including Vice President.  In addition  to Ted Wahby’s  love of  family  and pride in his successful business career,  he held a deep belief of the importance of giving back  to  the community. He  first sought  public office in 1979 and was elected to Lake  Shore School Board. Two years later he was  elected to the St. Clair Shores City Council,  and two years after that as Mayor, where he  provided strong,  forward  thinking  leadership  from 1983 to 1995. Ted then decided to take  his local experience to the next level by serving as Treasurer of Macomb County  from  1995 until his passing. Over this twenty year  period Ted devoted his  immense  talents  to  serving residents in a way that focused on the  human  element, while  using  his  profound  management skills  to place  the county  in a  strong fiscal position.  Whatever public office he held, for him the  test always was how his actions would  improve the lives of others, and in our many discussions, he was most proud how as county  Treasurer, he helped keep thousands of families who experienced financial stress from losing their homes to foreclosure.  His community and civic involvement was rivaled by few. The leadership he provided on  so many boards locally and throughout the region is yet another testament to his strong desire to serve the public. Ted was not one to  seek credit for his work, yet he was the recipient of numerous prestigious awards and recognitions from charitable and philanthropic organizations, far too many to list.  If there is one legacy of Ted Wahby’s service that will be remembered and valued above  all else, it is his premier leadership and advocacy for better health care. As a member of  McLaren Macomb Hospital’s Board of Trustees since 2000 and in the role of Chairman  since 2002, Ted strategically  leveraged his  business and political skills to make critical advances in the health care field. Ted’s mission  of opening the Ted B. Wahby Cancer Center  in  2004 was  very  personal  for  him  and  Yvonne, who both lost family members to cancer. He saw the need for compassionate, high  quality care close to home, since at the time  nearly 70% of Macomb cancer patients had to  drive a far distance for care. He was a tireless  supporter and fund-raiser from the very beginning, and worked for many years to influence  local leaders to invest in the capital campaign.  For his dedicated efforts, Ted earned many  accolades,  including  the 2005 Health Care  Leadership Award from the Michigan Health &  Hospital Association, and the 2005 Thanks for  Giving Award, presented for extraordinary volunteer service to hospitals in the Metro Detroit  area.  Over these last few days since Ted’s passing, there have been countless heartwarming  statements made by so many, but the one that  sums  it up  for me  is  that above all, Ted  Wahby was a  family man, as stated by his  children. His love for his wife, children, nine  grandchildren; and  three great-grandchildren  defined who he was and he set an example  for these generations to follow.  Mr. Speaker,  in closing,  I am profoundly  honored to have called Ted Wahby my friend,  and thankful for the opportunity to work side-  by-side during his career and witness  first-  hand his effective leadership and compassion.  I am humbled to join with his family, friends  and  the community at-large  in mourning his  loss, while celebrating his life and honoring his  accomplishments.

Sanders  for his past  three years of dedicated service as a Legislative Liaison for the Army Reserve. I wish him  well in his next assignment as an instructor at  the U.S. Army War College, Carlisle Barracks,  Pennsylvania.  Colonel Sanders  is currently assigned as  the Legislative Liaison for the 81st Regional  Support Command at Fort Jackson, South  Carolina. During the last three years, he supported Army Reserve units across the southeastern United States, meeting with Congressional staff and Federal, State and Local elected officials.  Prior  to  this assignment, Colonel Sanders  served one year in the International Security  Assistance Force Joint Command in Afghanistan, working as the Executive Officer to the  Command’s Operations Officer. From 2008 to  2011, he served on Capitol Hill as a Congressional Fellow and  then as a Liaison  in  the  Army House Liaison Division. His previous assignments include Mobilization Division Chief,  Assistant Professor of Military Science, Battalion Operations Officer, Detachment Commander, Battery Commander, Squadron Fire  Support Officer, Battery Executive Officer,  Troop Fire Support Officer and Platoon Leader.  Colonel Sanders holds a Masters of Strategic Studies  from  the United States Army  War College; a Masters of Public Administration  from  California  State  University,  Northridge; a Bachelor of Arts  in Political  Science from the University of California, Riverside; and a Certificate in Legislative Studies  Affairs  at  Institute  from  the Government  Georgetown University.  He is a graduate of the Army War College,  Reserve Component National Security Course,  Defense Strategy Course, Command  and  General Staff College, and the Field Artillery  Basic and Advanced Officer Courses.  His awards and decorations include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious  Service Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters,  Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Armed Forces  Service Medal, United Nations Medal, NATO  Medal and Army Staff Identification Badge. He  is a recipient of  the Order of Saint Maurice  from the National Infantry Association.  I wish Colonel Sanders, his wife Kari and  his daughters Kira and Kelli well as they move  to Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF STEVE  OKAMOTO  HON. JACKIE SPEIER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 8, 2015  ",2015
494,House,114,-0.364,20,2015-12-16,Mr. SWALWELL of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  First, let me express my thanks to  Mr. LOBIONDO, my colleague on the  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the chairman of its CIA  Subcommittee.  I serve as the subcommittee’s ranking member. I appreciate the bipartisan way that the chairman of the  whole  committee  and  our  ranking  member, Mr. SCHIFF, as well as the way  that Mr. LOBIONDO and  I have approached this critical issue of foreign  fighter flow.  ISIS is one of the greatest threats  facing the United States today. Defeating ISIS means that the United States  and its allies must be more coordinated  in our efforts to scrub ISIS from this  Earth and  to protect Americans at  home than ISIS is in attacking us. This  will require a multifaceted approach,  involving both foreign policy and the  way that our intelligence community  tracks ISIS here at home.  The threat posed by foreign fighters  who travel to and from a foreign zone  or a terrorist safe haven and then return to wreak havoc in the West is  both real and persistent.  The challenge is that, when these foreign fighters go to these countries, if  they are not killed on the battlefield,  oftentimes  they  learn  even  better  training and are able to return either  to Western Europe or other parts of the  world or even the United States with  improved training and an increased hatred for innocent people. That leaves us  very vulnerable.  b1200  To help confront  this  threat,  the  Tracking Foreign Fighters in Terrorist  Safe Havens Act builds on important  provisions in the 2016 Intelligence Authorization Act which require a report  on foreign fighter flows into and out of  Syria and Iraq. This would expand the  scope of that report.  This bill broadens this requirement  by calling on the Director of National  Intelligence to report regularly on foreign fighter travel to and from any foreign safe haven or terrorist safe haven.  If we do not know who is going to fight  in these hot zones, we will have an incomplete picture of our own vulnerabilities.  And, these reports have to be specific. They must include, for example,  the foreign fighters’ countries of origin, the number of foreign fighters who  have traveled to or departed each safe  haven, and the number of those whose  whereabouts remain unknown.  Importantly, to the extent a report is  submitted in a classified form, it must  also include an unclassified summary  of the report’s contents. I appreciate  the chairman agreeing to my request  to  include  this unclassified  requirement.  Increased  transparency  and  public  awareness  is very  important  in  the  fight against terrorism. These broad,  comprehensive reports will allow us to  better understand the foreign fighter  threat and, in turn, help all of us better protect our national security.  Let me again thank ",2015

496,,114,0.633,97,2015-12-16,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is  with profound sadness that I rise to honor the  life and dedicated service of James Randell  ‘Randy’ ’ Stokes, Sr. of Fort Walton Beach,  Florida, who died on December 8, 2015.  Mr. Stokes was born in Andalusia, Alabama  in the fall of 1932. During the Korean War, he  left high school to join the United States Army  and  became  an  intelligence  sergeant. Although only 18 years old, he graduated in the  top eight  from  the Light Artillery Battalion  Leadership School. In 1952, Mr. Stokes was  honorably discharged and returned home  to  Andalusia to finish high school, where he lettered  in  football, basketball, baseball, and  track. Following graduation, he attended Troy  State University to play football and study engineering. Then, in 1954, he transferred to Auburn University where he received his Bachelor’s degree in Architecture.  In 1959, Mr. Stokes moved to Fort Walton  Beach, the city he would call home until his  passing. Upon arriving  in Florida, he began  working at Ricks and Kendrick Architect, Inc.  and became partner after 10 years. In 1988,  he started his own firm—Stokes Architectural,  Inc.  Mr. Stokes has been honored by the Florida  Association of the American Institute of Architects for his leadership and community service  benefitting the profession of architecture. His  architectural work is on display in many Northwest Florida landmarks, including Saint Mary’s  School and Church  in Fort Walton Beach,  Niceville High School, Choctawhatchee High  School,  Fort Walton Beach High School,  Northwest Florida State College, the Greater  Fort Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce  building, the Walton County Chamber of Commerce building, White Wilson Medical Center,  and Westwood Retirement Center, among others.  In addition to his architectural contributions,  Mr. Stokes was a leader in Northwest Florida ’s  civic  society,  serving  as  president  of  the  Greater Fort Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce, twice as president of the local YMCA,  councilmember and Mayor of the City of Mary  Esther, president of  the Fort Walton Beach  Rotary Club, and a member of the Krewe of  Bowlegs.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the U.S. House of  Representatives,  I am proud  to honor  the  dedicated service of Randy Stokes. Vicki and  I will keep his entire family, especially his son,  James  Jr.  and  daughter-in-law,  Andrea;  daughter, Judy and son-in-law, Ken; daughter,  Jennifer; daughter, Janet and son-in-law, Don;  as well as his grandchildren Ross, Annie,  Ryan,  Christina,  Drew,  Conner,  LylaKae,  Bryna, Rand, and Champ; his nieces Terri and  Mellie; and his siblings Betty, Tommy, Kevin,  Jerry, and Silvia in our thoughts and prayers.  f  SUCCESS ON AND OFF THE FIELD  HON.
