0,15,1,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. President, for  39 years, Dr. Anthony Zukowsky has  worked for the freedom of the Ukrain ian people.  am very sorry to learn  that Dr. Zukowsky has  suffered  a  heart attack and remains  in critical  condition. His great efforts over the  years cannot be adequately acknowl edged or replaced, and his knowledge  of and determination for the Ukraini an cause  remain unparalleled.  It is  with Dr. Zukowsky's diligent efforts in  mind that I  read this letter from the  North Dakota branch of the Ukraini an Congress Committee of America,  Inc.  DEAR SENATOR ANDREWs. Yesterday,  the  Ukrainian people in the free world celebrat ed the 66th anniversary of the Proclamation  of Independence of Ukraine. It was on Janu ary 22,  1918,  that  this proclamation was  made in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine.  Following this declaration, the sovereign  of Ukraine struggled for 3 years against the  Russian Bolsheviks. They succumbed to the  aggressor who  established  in Ukraine  a  Communist  government  known  as  the  Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  Under  the Communist rule, millions of  Ukrainians have been annihilated. In 1983,  the Ukrainians in the free world called at tention to the 50th anniversary of the man made famine which caused the death of 7  mlll1on Ukrainians. Further, the churches  in Ukraine have been destroyed, the clergy  and  faithful  persecuted. All  aspects  of  Ukrainian life are controlled and directed  by Moscow.  Arrests, trials, convictions of thousands of  Ukrainians charged with ""anti-Soviet propa ganda  and  agitation""  have  been made.  Unfair trials and harsh sentences have been  given to members of the Ukrainian Helsinki  Accord monitoring groups. Extended prison  terms are now being given to dissident writ ers.  ",1984

DOLE,  U.S. Senator for Kansas, Hart Senate Of/ice  Building, Washington, D.C.  DEAR BoB: The Kansas Telephone Associa tion, by action of its board of directors, sup ports your plan to effect a compromise of  several of the issues relating to the telecom munications  industry. The  three  points  which you propose that the FCC adopt as  changes in present policy,  in our opinion,  will benefit the Kansas ratepayers and will  provide a reasonable time within which to  assess some of the effects of deregulation  and the divestiture of AT&T.  While  a  substantial majority  of  our  member companies endorse these concepts,  there are a few who feel that the enactment  of legislation would be a better course to  follow and they probably will communicate  their views to you.  We're grateful to you for the interest you  have shown in trying to resolve some of our  persistent problems and we're especially ap preciative of  the  time and efforts of Ed  Duckers and Mike Petit in contacting not  only the telephone companies throughout  the state but many of our customers during  the past few weeks. We trust that this close  cooperation may continue and that you will  call on us whenever you believe we can be of  assistance to you in any matter.  Sincerely yours,  GILBERT V. CROUSE,  President.  ",1984
2,41,1,Mr. DOLE.," Madam President, I am  not certain what the bypass problem  may turn out to be. But there appears  to be at least some concern expressed  by a number of people that we visited  with. So there were 32 of us who sent  a  letter to  the Federal Communica tions Commission. I have asked that a  copy of that letter be printed in the  RECORD.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of the temporary order of the Federal  Communications Commission  appear  in the RECORD. They will make, as I  understand  it,  a  final  order  on  Wednesday of this week.  There being no objection, the order  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  REcoRD, as follows:  [Report No. 17831, Action in Docket Case,  Jan.19, 19841  FCC DELAYS $2 CHARGE  <CC Docket 78-72, Phase I>  The Commission decided to delay end user  access charges for residential and single line  business customers in light of requests from  citizens and public officials that such end  user charges be delayed for further study.  The Commission also concluded that a delay  is necessary  to enable the Commission to  devise an exemption for end users who may  not be able to afford any end user charge,  and to allow a Federal/State Joint Board  more time to evaluate proposals to provide  more assistance to customers of small tele phone companies.  The Commission will issue a Supplemen tal Notice In the near future Inviting comments on the exemption question and how  best to implement an end user charge plan  for all residential and single line business  customers. The Commission said  that  its  view at this time was there should be a more  gradual  transition stretching to 1990 and  that  the charge  to  customers would be  capped at $4.00 during this transition. This  would result in a sharing of cost burdens by  the telephone customers and the telephone  carriers. The Commission  intends  to  take  comments regarding now best to implement  this proposall, and at the same time to rig orously study all possible effects of the pro posals upon the universality of telephone  service. In addition, the agency will contin ue  to  investigate  the effects on universal  service of federal decisions in general.  The Commission  also  said  that  it  re mained convinced that bypass of the public  telecommunications network by large users  poses a  significant and present threat  to  universal service, and that it intended to use  the additional time provided by the djlay of  the end user charge proposal  to compile  more detailed information upon the extent  and dangers of bypass. The Commission di rected its staff to strive to complete the fur ther proceedings ordered by December 1,  1984 so that it would be possible for any  new plan and tariff arrangements to be put  in place by June 1985.  Regarding small telephone companies, the  Commission said  that it  intends  to meet  their need for more assistance than their  large counterparts because  they generally  have a smaller base of business subscribers  and less flexibility in recovering above aver age costs without adverse effects on residen tial subscribers. Thus, the Commission di rected the staff to prepare Notices to gather  comments on methods to provide even more  financial assistance to small telephone com panies. Among the options under consider ation at this time include: < 1 > giving smaller  telephone companies latitude to collect end  user charges or not; or <2> increasing assist ance for  local exhange carriers with  less  than 50,000 loops in a study area to cover 80  percent of loop costs between 110 percent  and 200 percent of the national average.  The Commission recognized that delay of  the end user charge would require that the  revenue  requirement  for  the  Carrier  Common Line access element be increased  to compensate for the loss of revenues that  would have been  received  from end user  charges paid by residential and single line  business customers. No change was made in  the charges for multi-line business custom ers.  The Commission also decided to revise the  rules for the computation of access charges  to be paid by carriers that provide alterna tives to AT&T's long distance services, such  as MCI's Execunet  service  and GTE's  SPRINT service. The agency was convinced  by arguments made by NTIA, the Depart ment of Justice, and several carriers, that  the existing plan could have undesirable  competitive  consequences  and  that  care  should be taken to ensure the maintenance  of  competition  through  the  transition  period leading up to the time when all inter state carriers could be provided interconnec tion to local exchanges comparable to that  enjoyed by AT&T. Therefore, the Commis sion prescribed two  levels of charges, one  for ""equal"" access to a switch comparable to  that provided AT&T and one for ""unequal""  access comparable to that presently afford ed to most of AT&T's competitors. All long  distance carriers will pay the same rate for  equal access. A  total differential of 55% was  ",1984
3,80,1,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker, I  raise a question of the privileges of the  House, and I offer a privileged resolu tion <H. Res. 390) and ask for its im mediate consideration.  The Clerk read the resolution, as fol lows:  H. REs. 390  Resolved, That effective 30 days after the  adoption of this resolution, each Standing  and Select Committee of the House, except  for the Committee on Standards of Official  Conduct,  shall be constituted  in a  ratio  which is proportionate to the membership  of the two political parties in the House as a  whole; and each subcommittee thereof shall  also be so constituted; and insofar as practi cable,  the staffs of each Committee shall  also reflect these same ratios.  The  SPEAKER.  The  gentleman  from California has been kind enough  to advise the Chair that he was going  to offer this resolution as a question of  privilege at the appropriate time, and  now is the appropriate time.  Would the gentleman state why he  feels the resolution constitutes a ques tion of privilege?  ",1984
4,80,1,Mr. DANNEMEYER.,"  I would  be  happy  to, Mr. Speaker. It has  long  been recognized that the integrity of  the proceedings by which bills are con sidered is a matter of privilege. <Hinds  Precedents Ill, 2597-2601, 2614; and  IV, 3383, 3388, 3478).  I especially draw the Chair's atten tion to III, 2602 and Ill, 2603 which  show that error or obstruction of mi nority views are matters of privilege.  In the first instance, in the year 1880,  it was held that the matter of correct ing the reference of a public bill presented a question of privilege at a time  when there was not any other means  of correction provided for in the rules.  The point was made on the floor that  this matter was one involving the in tegrity  of  the  proceedings  of  the  House and as such was privileged.  In the next reference, a charge in vestigated  in 1863 as a question of  privilege was ""the charge that the mi nority views of a committee had been  abstracted from the Clerk's office by a  Member      ."" Both of these prece dents indicate that it is a longstanding  matter that the minority is granted its  ""day in court"" on questions such as  these which are questions  impacting  on the integrity of the proceedings of  the House. And further,  these ques tions indicate that it is the process by  which  legislation  is developed which  affects the integrity of the proceed ings of the House. I submit that the  disproportional  ratio  of  committee  membership and staffing even more  profoundly impacts on the process by  which legislation is developed and that  there is no question that my resolu tion involves a question of privilege.  Some might argue that my resolu tion does not fall within the ambit of  privilege because they would say it is a  motion  to amend  the  rules of  the  House or would ""effect a change in  the rules of the House of their inter pretation.""  <Ruling  by  Speaker  O'NEILL, Dec. 7, 1977, pp. 38470-73.)  However, upon close examination the  Chair will find that my resolution is  indeed a question of privilege and that  the December 7, 1977, ruling does not  apply here.  My resolution does not amend the  rules of the House because the prac tice we are attempting to change is not  a rule. It is a custom-a longstanding  custom of the majority party that su presses the legitimate representation  of the rights of the minority. I have  been unable to find-and I challenge  any Member of the House to show me  where in the House rules it says the  ratio in the Rules Committee, for ex ample, shall be nine majority and four  minority. It is certainly not in rules X  and XI which set forth the establish ment and conduct of committees.  The first and only mention of this  ratio appears in official records of the  House when  the  committee  assign ments are made by  the Democratic  Caucus or the Republican Conference  after the Speaker has notified the Re publican  leader  of  the number of  party vacancies on each of the several  committees.  Mr. Speaker, my resolution is not ef fecting a change in the rules.  I am  simply attempting to change the arbi trary political policy of the House-an  arbitrary  custom which  indeed  ad versely affects the integrity of the pro ceedings of the House.  The SPEAKER. The Chair knows it  is the duty of the Chair to preside and  to determine questions of privilege.  Under the precedents of the House  cited on page 329 of the House Rules  and Manual, a question of the privileges of the House may not be invoked  to effect a change in the rules of the  House or  their  interpretation. The  gentleman  from California contends  that the resolution which he has pre sented addresses not a specific stand ing rule of the House, but the customs  and  traditions of the House, and  is  thus not to be governed by the prece dents in the manual.  In the opinion of the Chair, the res olution does constitute a change in the  rules of the House, by imposing a di rection  that  the composition of all  standing  committees  be  changed  within 30 days. The rules of the House  do address the question of the proce dure by which full committee member ship and staff selections are to be ac complished. As indicated on page 399  of the manual, rule X, clause 6, the re spective party caucus and conference  perform an essential role in presenting  privileged  resolutions  to  the House,  both at the commencement of a Con gress and subsequently to fill vacan cies. Because the issue of committee  ratios can be properly presented to the  House in a privileged manner by direc tion of the party conference or caucus,  and because rule, XI, clause 6, estab lishes a procedure for selection of per manent committee professional  and  clerical staff, the Chair rules that the  resolution constitutes an attempt  change procedures established under  the rules of the House and does not  therefore present a question of  the  privileges of the House.

5,80,1,Mr. DANNEMEYER.,"  Speaker.  thank  the  to  I  D 1300  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE  SPEAKER  The SPEAKER. The Chair desires  to make an announcement.  After consultation with the majority  and minority leaders, and with their  consent and approval,  the Chair an nounces  that Wednesday when  the  Houses meet in joint session to hear  an address by  the President of the  United States, only the doors immedi ately opposite the Speaker and those  on his left and right will be open.  No one will be allowed on the floor  of the House who does not have the  privilege of the floor of the House.  Due to the large attendance which is  anticipated, the Chair feels that the  rule  regarding  the privilege of  the  floor must be strictly adhered to.  Children of Members will not be per mitted on the floor and the coopera tion of all the Members is requested.  Does the majority leader have any  requests?  ",1984
6,80,1,Mr. WRIGHT.," No, Mr. Speaker, I  have none at this time.  ",1984
7,93,1,The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore.,  Is  there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Colorado?  ,1984
8,93,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, reserv ing the right to object, I yield to the  gentleman from Georgia <Mr. GING RICH).  ",1984
9,93,1,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, I just  want to make the point for the Mem bers of  the majority party, because  they do not seem to fully understand  what we  are  trying  to  accomplish,  that, contrary to the earlier statement  of the distinguished gentleman from  Wisconsin, your party controls  this  floor every day all day during the ses sion. You control the time. As your  Speaker has told us, you control the  calendar. You have virtual dictator ship.  One of the few rules we have that  gives us a chance to say our piece is to  talk during special orders, one of the  few times we have control of the floor.  And,  in  fact,  last  fall, your deputy  whip systematically took time in order  to be able to take the time when he  wanted  it. So  that from our stand point, as the minority, having watched  through the latter part of last year  when a number of people,  including  some who are in this Chamber right  this moment, attempted to ram things  through this House on your schedule,  according to your rules, the way you  wanted to do it, we are simply trying  to follow the same rules.  We offered a  legitimate request. It  was,  as  the gentleman pointed out,  perfectly legitimate for him to object.  However, by so doing, he sets the tone.  And I sincerely hope that my friend,  the gentleman from Pennsylvania, will  object to this particular request.  ",1984
10,93,1,Mr. WALKER.," Further  reserving  the right  to object, Mr. Speaker,  I  would simply say that that is precisely  the point  that  the gentleman has  made.  The only time that the minority has  to control any debate time at all, the  only time when debate time is in our  hands, is under special orders or when  we get 1-minute requests.  This was  simply  an  attempt  to  assure that at the end of each legisla tive day  the minority would  in fact  have an opportunity  to debate sub jects based upon the fact that we con trol the time rather than the majority  controlling the time.  I  think it is positively appalling; I  think it shows the kind of dictatorship  that this House has become when the  minority is denied their rights under  the rules of the House to participate  and to go forward with the debate.  ",1984
11,93,1,Mr. WEBER.," Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1984
12,93,1,Mr. WALKER.," Further  reserving  the right to object, I yield to the gen tleman from Minnesota.  ",1984
13,93,1,Mr. WEBER.," I thank my colleague  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I would just like tore inforce the point the gentleman has  made. This is not simply a delaying  tactic or anything like that.  Earlier in the day a number of Mem bers made legitimate unanimous-con sent requests  to bring  to  this floor  items of substance and interest to the  majority of  the American people-a  balanced budget constitutional amend ment, voluntary school prayer consti tutional amendment, a  line-item veto  constitutional  amendment,  and  a  human  life  amendment-important  issues which will never be brought to  the floor of  this House for debate,  given  the present disposition of the  leadership of the majority party.  Thus, our only possibility to discuss  at length these and a number of other  substantive issues that the majority of  the people support is in the section of  the day called special orders, when we  as the minority have the opportunity  to bring our agenda to the floor-not  for action, but at least for debate.  For that reason I strongly support  what the gentleman from Pennsylva nia is doing.  ",1984
14,93,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, further  reserving the right to object, I yield to  the gentleman from California <Mr.  LUNGREN).  ",1984
15,93,1,Mr.  LUNGREN.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  think it is rather ironic that we had a  spokesman for the other side of the  aisle tell us that this would prohibit  the Democrats  from  speaking until  after the Members on this side of the  aisle have spoken.  If anyone has noted the 1 minute  session, they will note that the Speak er of the House always allows all of  the Democrats who  are  seated  to  speak at the same time as the Republi cans, and in many cases allows those  Democrats, who come down long after  we have been waiting for perhaps as  much as an hour, to speak before we  are allowed to speak.  Now, maybe they think that is insig nificant. Perhaps it is. But it is also  just as  insignificant  that  this will  allow a number of Republicans,  the  minority party,  to speak before  the  majority party, which controls  this  place, has their opportunity to speak  as well.  We were denied on four specific oc casions today the opportunity to bring  to  the  floor  specific  constitutional  amendments that are very controver sial  in many  respects but certainly  cannot be discounted as being insignif icant. We went that route because we  have been denied on a regular basis in  this House the opportunity to bring  those  things  before  the  people's  House,  the Representatives  of  the  people.  Second, the gentleman from Califor nia <Mr. DANNEMEYER)  pointed out  today how unfair the committee ratio  is. It is unfair in terms of those people  who are allowed to vote and in terms  of those staff people that we have, and  so we are denied the opportunity to  have equal access to debate in commit tees, just as we are on the floor.  Now there is an attempt to deny us  an opportunity to have time that we  control for some sustained period of  time. It seems  to be OK when  the  leadership of the Democratic side de cides to do that. The gentleman from  Texas <Mr. GONZALEZ) has taken time  for more than 1 day on other occa sions. There have been other Members  who have made multiple requests on  other  times. But because  somehow  this will give the minority a legitimate  opportunity to debate legitimate issues  in a  very, very political year  that  might upset the effort of the Demo cratic Congressional Committee  to  have what they want in what is quoted  in today's Washington Post a dull po litical year, that somehow the oppor tunity  for  individual Members who  represent constituencies who happen  to be in the minority party will not be  allowed that opportunity.  It seems to me that we have made a  legitimate request. If in fact the other  side is going to insist on objecting to  such legitimate requests, we have no  recourse but to use the only protection  any minority has  in any  legislative  body, and that is to use the rules. And  we will do so.  ",1984
16,93,1,Mr. WALKER., I  thank the gentle man for his statement.  ,1984
17,93,1,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker,  will the gentleman yield?  ",1984
18,93,1,Mr. WALKER.," Further  reserving  the right  to object, Mr. Speaker,  I  yield to the gentlewoman from Colora do.  ",1984
19,93,1,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, I  think there are several things we des perately need to point out here. First  of all, the allegations that the deputy  whip  preempted  all  the  days,  the  deputy whip did not preempt every  single legislative day, which is the at tempt that is being made on that side,  that every single day scheduled for  legislation you are attempting to do  that.  ",1984
20,93,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, reclaim ing my time, for a moment, nobody  contended  that he preempted every  legislative day. We contended, though,  that he set the pattern of taking time  in advance so that he could preempt  some time and schedule media events  for the country and so that he could in  fact preempt our ability to speak to  issues late in the day.  ",1984
21,106,1,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Texas <Mr. CoLEMAN) is  recognized for 15 minutes.   ",1984
22,106,1,Mr.  COLEMAN  of  Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  the motion offered by Mr. WALKER of  Pennsylvania to bring a constitutional  amendment on school prayer directly  to the floor of the House, bypassing  the committee process and  limiting  debate on this important  issue  to a  mere 1 hour.  This motion would create a  terrible  precedent for considering any change  to the basic principles of the Republic.  Every constitutional amendment we  have ever had has been preceded by  extensive hearings where opponents  and  supporters  can have  sufficient  time to present their case and allow  Members of Congress  to weigh  the  facts  of  the  issue  based on  their  merits. Allowing 1 hour of debate that means total time of debate, be cause there would have been no hear ings, no  testimony, no witnesses, no  chance to invoke the basic American  ideals of a  fair hearing for everyone,  regardless of  their views-would not  permit this process to take place. The  legislative process would  be  turned  into a  railroad, and the House would  end up spending far less of its time on  a change in the U.S. Constitution than  it would on a routine bill.  I also object to the use of clearly im proper procedural tactics to force al leged votes on an issue. We will soon  be subject  to, no doubt, a  flurry of  press  releases  denouncing  a  ""vote  against school prayer,"" when in fact  Mr. WALKER and others know as well  as I do that it has nothing to do at all  with the supposed issue at hand. The  issue at stake  is the preservation of  the integrity of the process by which  we amend our basic principles. Surely  the supporters of school prayer de serve better than this, because efforts  to erode the constitutional process, no  matter how worthy the issue on whose  behalf the erosion would take place,  serve no legitimate end.e  THE FAIRNESS ISSUE AND THE  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  ",1984
23,106,1,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman  from  Pennsylvania  <Mr.  WALKER) is recognized for 60 minutes.  ",1984
24,106,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thought it would be useful to try to  put in perspective a  little bit some of  the  things  that  took place on  the  House floor earlier, and I would like to  lead off, in putting that in perspective  by,  first of all,  thanking you, Mr.  Speaker, for your  indulgence during  that period of time when words got a  little heated and  things got a  little  sticky at  times. We  appreciate  the  work that the Chair did during that  period of time, and we thank you for  putting up with what was sometimes a  tough situation.  But it seems to me that it is impor tant to understand that we opened up  this  legislative  session by  trying  to  point out that there is a problem in  this House of Representatives. The  problem  is  that the majority party,  the liberals in this body who talk so  much about fairness but who are per fectly willing to use rules and laws to  trample the minority, do not play by  the rules. When the rules are used in a  way which  they do not agree with,  they simply ignore the rules and go  on. That is not only unfair, it is downright dictatorial. That was a part of a  number of things that were done on  this House floor today.  First of all, it was raised by the majority leader that we should dispense  ",1984
25,132,1,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Speaker, are cently released study conducted by the  children's  defense  fund,  entitled  ""American Children in Poverty"" out lines some dismal statistics on the con ditions  of America's children. The  study states that since 1979, 3.1 mil lion children or 3,000 a day have fallen  into poverty. The numbers are awe some. I for one believe that if there is  even one child in this country who is  hungry-that is one too many.  The 3.1 million overall child poverty  figure represents an increase of 31 per cent-the sharpest  increase  in child  poverty since such statistics have been  collected. This  increase  in children  living in poverty  is primarily due in  great part  to  the  cuts  in Federal  human services programs pushed by  the Reagan administration.  Unfortunately, many Members  of  this body were led to believe that it  would be better to support the eco nomic recovery package marketed by  the Reagan administration,  than  to  stand up for the poor and disadvan taged of this country. The notion that  an overall economic  recovery would  rise the tide that floats all boats has  caused much pain and suffering for  those poor working families who were  not armed with boats but floated on  leaky rafts.  The study estimates that even under  the best economic conditions no more  than one-third of the 3.1 million chil dren will be rescued from poverty in  the absence of  targeted and urgent  governmental and private sector ef forts.  As we contemplate acting on the ad ministration's  proposed  fiscal  year  1985 budget, I  trust that our actions  will be tempered by the existing reali ty. America's children are severely suf fering. Poverty offers little hope for  the precious young of our country.  Though often said, but not fully un derstood-America's future is depend ent on our  investment  in America's  children. Consequently,  I want  share the overview and major findings  of the study in hopes that it will per suade Members of his body to act in  America's best interest-her children.  to  OVERVIEW AND MAJOR FnmiNGS  Although all Americans have been weath ering a  recession, America's children have  suffered most. Across the board federal cuts  in survival programs for children in a time  of  family unemployment and need have  worsened the plight of needy children. This  is  apparent  in  the creeping upwards of  infant mortality in a number of states; in  the decreasing access of mothers and chil dren to prenatal, delivery, and preventive  health care; in the growing reports of child  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  abuse and neglect;  in unmet child care  needs; and in shrinking supplemental educa tion services.  I. DECREASE IN PRENATAL CARE  Over the past three years, there has been  a disturbing nationwide decrease in the per centage of women receiving prenatal care  during the first three months of pregnancy  and rise in the percentage of women receiv ing late or no prenatal care.  II. INCREASING INFANT MORTALITY  Between 1981 and 1982, death rates for all  infants increased in 11 states: for white in fants in 9 states, and for nonwhite infants  in 13 states. National nonwhite infant mor tality  rates  remain unacceptably high as  does the mortality ""gap"" between nonwhite  and white infants.  III. LAG IN MEETING SURGEON GENERAL'S GOALS  At the current rate of progress, a majority  of reporting states will not meet the Sur geon General's modest 1990 goals for reduc tion in infant mortality. Those that do, will  do so in the costliest rather than the most  cost-effective way:  by  saving  premature  babies through expensive neonatal intensive  care  rather  than by producing healthier  babies through adequate prenatal care.  IV. GROWING EXCLUSION PROM HEALTH CARE  Federal budget cuts and changes in Title  V Maternal and Child Health Programs,  Community and Migrant Health programs,  and Medicaid have contributed significantly  to increasing numbers of poor women and  children without money or insurance being  turned away  from prenatal, delivery and  other needed care.  V. CHILDREN'S SHRINKING MEDICAID SHARE  As a result of massive federal AFDC and  Medicaid cuts and severe institutional infla tion, the children's share of Medicaid has  shrunk significantly in a period when the  number of poor children has increased dra matically.  VI. REDUCED AFDC FOR POOR FAMILIES  Thousands of truly needy children have  suffered loss or decrease of AFDC benefits  despite increasing child poverty.  VII. STRESS OF UNEMPLOYMENT FUELS CHILD  ABUSE  Epidemic unemployment and severe cut backs  in AFDC, Medicaid, nutrition pro grams,  social  service,  housing  assistance,  and child welfare have increased family ten sions and caused parents to strike out at  their own children or consider foster care. A  growing sense of desperation, helplessness,  and hopelessness pervades the poor.  VIII. WORKING PARENTS FACE CHILD CARE  DILEMMAS  Although child care is an essential service  for low-income parents seeking to work, fed eral support of already limited Title XX  care has been slashed.  IX. EDUCATIONAL HELP FOR DISADVANTAGED  CHILDREN SLASHED  Reagan Administration budget  cuts  in  education have unfairly hurt poor and non white children.e  January 23, 1981,  FOOD SAFETY  HON. LEE H. HAMILTON  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 23, 1984  e ",1984
26,132,1,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would  like to insert my Washington  report for Wednesday, December 21,  1983, into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:  FooD SAFETY  To my surprise, the issue of food safety  comes up frequently in public meetings even  though the media pay relatively scant at tention to it. This is understandable, I sup pose, because food safety is something that  touches our lives daily.  My first comment is nothing more than a  simple observation:  the American people  today enjoy the world's best and safest food  supply. We all have a strong interest in en suring that these high standards are main tained. The productivity of our farmers and  the effectiveness of our food processing and  distribution system are primarily responsi ble  for  the wide variety of high-quality  foods available in our supermarkets. Con gress and federal regulatory agencies, such  as  the  Food  and Drug Administration  <FDA>. have also played a key role through  legislation to help create an ample, nutri tious food supply with the greatest benefit  and lowest risk to consumers.  Simple though the issue may seem <""Is  the food safe, or isn't it?""), food safety is  one of the most complex on the national  agenda. At one time or another, Americans  have worried about food-borne diseases such  as botulism, the toxic substances sometimes  present in natural foods, the chemical con taminants in meat and fish, and the resi dues of pesticides in fruits and vegetables. It  is my  impression, however,  that Hoosiers  are most concerned about the effects of arti ficial additives introduced into foods to pre serve or color them. It is easy to see why  this concern is so intense. In some cases,  laboratory experiments have shown a link  between ingestion of additives and the inci dence of cancer in test animals.  Since 1958, the FDA has been required by  Section 409 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act, the so-called ""Delaney Clause,"" to ban  the use of any additive ""if it is found to  induce cancer when  ingested by man or  animal."" Over the years, the Delaney Clause  has been interpreted to mean that an addi tive can be used only if there is a reasonable  certainty that it will not be harmful. While  most of us support the idea of strict en forcement of laws designed to keep carcino gens out of our food supply, enforcement of  the Delaney Clause  in  recent years has  become controversial. In 1977, the FDA de termined  that  saccharin  caused  bladder  cancer in laboratory test animals and direct ed its removal from the market, but public  demand for continued availability of saccha rin led Congress to exempt it from the pro hibitions of the Delaney Clause.  In another case,  the FDA made certain  laboratory studies and concluded that ni trite, a chemical preservative used in proc essed meats such as frankfurters and bacon,  caused cancer in test animals. Under the De laney Clause, the FDA would have been re quired to ban the use of nitrite, thus calling  into question the continued availability of a  critical component of  the nation's meat  supply. Ultimately,  the  results of other  studies did not support a finding that nitrite  ",1984
27,158,1,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, on Jan uary 27 at the annual dinner of the  Laurel Arts, Mrs. Dorothy Dressler  will be presented with the Governor's  Hazlett Memorial Award  for  excel lence in the arts in the field of Service  to the Arts in the State of Pennsylva nia.  I certainly add my congratulations  to this very deserved award. With a  distinguished record of service to the  arts,  it particularly should be noted  that Mrs. Dressler donated the house  and grounds for Laurel Arts' Philip  Dressler Center for the Arts in Somer set, Pa., which is Pennsylvania's only  professionally  staffed  rural  arts  center.  One of the achievements Congress  has made in working with the Nation al Endowment for the Arts is to make  the Federal Government more con scious of  the very special needs of  rural arts projects, and the very strong  impact which arts can have  in  the  rural areas. For too long, the Nation  thought of a strong arts program as  something contained only in the major  urban areas, but  through  the hard  work of many people in our area, we  have been one of the communities to  prove that arts can be distinguished in  rural areas and make a definite com munity contribution.  the Government  in the direction of  rural arts, the very clear fact is that  While I am proud of helping to move  ",1984

30,197,1,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, I  interrupt the Senator to interject that  it was a paraphrasing of what  the  Chairman of the Federal Communica tions Commission said when he said  ""Yes, the decision is political."" They  needed to make this decision last week  in order to forestall the action we take  now. He conceded that it was pressure  from Congress that caused the change.  ",1984
31,197,1,Mr. LAUTENBERG.,"  I  thank  the  Senator from Oregon.  Mr. President, I do not, however, see  that as a reason to belittle or reject  what the Commission has done.  As the Chairman of the FCC admit ted to the Washington Post, ""We are  sensitive,"" he said, ""to what the Con gress is thinking.""  Well, it is about time.  I thought our goal all along was to  change the Commission's course, and  change it we have.  The distinguished chairman of the  committee has expressed fear that the  Commission may again revise its deci sion. Mr. President, I hope that the  FCC has gotten our message, and I be lieve they have. I do not believe we  should put ourselves  in a  legislative  straitjacket out of mistrust  for  the  FCC.  The fact is that we have independ ent regulatory agencies because Con gress is not equipped to undertake de tailed  ratemaking proceedings on a  day-to-day basis. The FCC  is better  suited to respond to problems as they  arise.  Take,  for example,  the matter of  special access  tariffs. Certainly Con gress did not know last summer that  rate increases requested would be so  high, threatening the viability of a va riety  of  networks  utilizing  private  lines, from the networks of RCA and  Western Union,  to the network that  serves a national system of  interli brary loans.  At least so far, the Commission has  responded appropriately,  I  think, by  suspending those tariffs, pending fur ther review. I have no cause to criti cize the Commission because they delayed things until April. If the case for  the tariffs has still not been made, the  Commission should delay them even  further.  It is our appropriate role, I think, to  maintain strict oversight. It is our job  to set our clear principles and guide lines.  Mr. President, the FCC will finalize  its order tomorrow. Many of our col leagues would like to wait for the FCC  to act  tomorrow before  considering  the bill. I support that position. If the  FCC confirms its order, as it is expect ed to do, I will urge us to put the legis lation aside.  Mr. President, I had hoped at this  point that the Senator from Kansas  would  be present on  the  floor  to  engage  in a colloquy with me about  the prospects for separate legislation  regarding the issue of pension porta bility rights for employees affected by  divestiture. I spoke to him earlier in  the day on this, and I understand him  to be as committed as I  to resolving  this issue early in this session. At the  moment, unfortunately, he is chairing  hearings at the Finance Committee.  However, I do want my colleagues to  know  that Senator DoLE and  I  are  seeking assurances on this score, and I  know the Senator from Kansas is com mitted to addressing the pension issue  early this session, on a vehicle that  will find itself moving from the Cap itol down Pennsylvania Avenue to the  White House.  As many of my colleagues know, em ployees of companies affected by the  AT&T  divestiture  are  deeply  con cerned about protecting  their hard earned pension  rights. The consent  decree  implementing  the divestiture  contained unsatisfactory provisions on  that score. Because the issue was ad dressed in the consent decree, Federal  legislation  is necessary  to modify  it.  No Federal money is involved. And I  have been personally assured that offi cials at AT&T and many of the Bell  operating companies understand  the  need for such  legislation and would  not oppose it.  Therefore, Mr. President, I intend to  seek  the Senator  from Kansas out  later to see what progress he has made  on his side of the aisle on this ques tion.  In closing, Mr. President, I want to  say that it is a privilege to have been  able to work on this issue in the com mittee chaired by the Senator from  Oregon. Each and every member of  the Commerce Committee exhibited  extreme  diligence  and  perseverence  during our consideration of S. 1660.  Although we may be on separate  sides of the issue today, the chairman  of  the committee deserves consider able credit for moving the FCC toward  a more  reasoned position on  these  issues. Senator GoLDWATER,  the sub committee chairman, contributed his  ",1984
32,210,1,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, today  I am introducing legislation to address  the growing problem of parents who  fail to make court-ordered child sup port payments.  When parents bring children  into  the world, they have a responsibility  to care for that child. Too often, non custodial parents do not fulfill that re sponsibility. It has become a national  disgrace.  This  legislation, which  is  cospon sored  by  Senators  DURENBERGER,  GRASSLEY, PACKWOOD, MOYNIHAN, LAU TENBERG,  MELCHER,  HOLLINGS,  HAT FIELD, and BOSCHWITZ,  is a bipartisan  effort to assure the payment of child  support  through mandatory  income  withholding,  incentive  payments  to  States, and other improvements in the  child support enforcement program.  We cannot act soon enough. In the  past years,  the number of children  living in single parent families has in creased dramatically.  In 1980  there  were more than 8 million families with  minor children headed by one parent.  Both parents should be responsible for  giving  their  children  food,  shelter,  health care, and an education.  Too often, one parent is not doing  his or her share to provide support. In  1978 about 7 million women were rais ing ~hildren under the age of 21 in a  household where  the  children's fa thers were not present. Fully 40 per cent of  those mothers  received no  child support awards. Of the 60 per cent -who were entitled to child sup port, 28 percent never got the mo~ey,  and 23 percent consistently received  less than the amount awarded by the  court. This legislation is designed  to  confront the problem of child support  enforcement and to begin solving it.  The bill mandates that States must  enact laws requiring the use of speci fied procedures  in  the operation of  their child support enforcement and  paternity  establishment  programs.  The major required procedures are as  follows:  First, mandatory wage withholding  if child support payments are delin quent in an amount equal to 1 month's  support.  Second, new  administrative proce dures assure that States will make all  reasonable efforts to improve the en forcement of child support obligations.  Third, the withholding of State tax  refunds payable  to a parent of an  AFDC child,  if  the parent  is delin quent in support payments.  Fourth,  requiring  individuals who  have demonstrated a pattern of delin quent payments to post a bond, or give  some other guarantee to secure pay ment of past-due support.  In addition,  the bill  replaces  the  present  incentive  formula which  re wards States for collections made on  behalf of AFDC families with a new  formula which rewards States for col lections made on behalf of both AFDC  and non-AFDC families. The Federal  incentive payment  increases  as  the  State's ratio of collections to adminis trative costs improves. Finally, the bill  authorizes $15 million a year for dem onstration grants  to States  to  test  methods of improving interstate col lections.  In New Jersey some steps have been  taken  to  improve  the collections of  child support. The State runs a solid,  cost-efficient program. And we have  an outstanding child support enforce ment program in Essex County begun  by County Executive Peter Shapiro  more than 2 years ago. We need simi lar  initiatives  extended  to  every  county and every State in this Nation.  The bill that Senator DURENBERGER  and I are introducing today is identical  to  legislation championed by Repre sentative MARGE  RouKEMA  in  the  House. That legislation passed unani mously and I look forward to the same  action in the Senate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the bill be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  was  ordered  to  be printed  RECORD, as follows:  the bill  in  the  S.2207  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS  SECTION 1.

33,223,1,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, if inva sions are de facto declarations of war,  then Cuba  is at war with us. Once  before, Cuba unleashed an unprece dented invasion by unarmed ""boat-sol diers,"" the Marielito convicts. Now, it  is invasion by chemicals, chemical war fare by drug pushing and drug traf ticking.  Two years ago, I expressed my con cern to the Senate about the many al legations surfacing with regard to con siderable and pervasive involvement of  Cuba in drug dealing and drug smug gling. At that time, I asked the Perma nent Subcommittee on  Investigation  for a further inquiry into these allega tions. The subcommittee immediately  responded  and  launched  an  all-out  effort. However, it honored a Drug En forcement Administration  request  to  hold off hearings since the DEA was  in the middle of intensive  investiga tions. These culminated in grand jury  indictments of  four Cuban officials.  The subcommittee agreed not to do  anything which would be detrimental  to DEA's project. Since  the  indict ments, however, there have been sev eral congressional hearings by other  subcommittees which have substanti ated  the active participation of  the  Cuban Government in organized drug  smuggling activities. I believe the evi dence now in hand discloses shocking  acts and continuing criminal behavior  on the part of a government, and I  strongly believe that this matter must  be brought before  the  international  community. It is important that Con gress urge the President to bring to  the attention of the world the repre hensible criminality of Cuban involve ment in drug trafficking.  Aside from the Federal grand jury  indictment of four Cuban officials on  charges of conspiring to smuggle drugs  into the United States, there has been  testimony at hearings alleging concert ed efforts by the Government of Cuba  to facilitate  the flow of illicit drugs  into the United States and into other  countries. Cuban agents have testified  to the intentional involvement by the  highest ranking officials of the Gov ernment of Cuba in illicit drug dealing  and  other witnesses  have  testified  about alleged Government-sponsored  cultivation of poppy fields in Cuba for  the production of opium and about  laboratories  in Cuba  authorized  to  process brown heroin which finds its  way to the United States via Mexico.  The State Department  confirmed  some  time ago  that Cuba  is giving  sanctuary to drug smuggling ships for  refueling and maintenance. Cuba is al lowing mother ships, laden with illegal  drugs from Latin America, to operate  within Cuban waters while unloading  onto smaller vessels for drug runs into  Florida. In return,  the drug dealers  are transporting arms and money to  aid guerrilla operations within  the  hemisphere. In the thrust of one oper ation, Castro is able to strike viciously  at U.S. society by aiding the drug traf fickers to spread their poison and, in  turn, use the smugglers to help arm  and fund  terrorism. I do not doubt,  either, that Cuba is pocketing a sub stantial amount of profits from protec tion fees assessed the traffickers.  Whether Cuba  is directly pushing  drugs or merely allowing, aiding, or  protecting drug smugglers within  its  territory, Cuba has violated an estab lished principle of international law.  This basic principle is that no country  has the right to use or permit the use  of its territory in such a manner as to  injure  another  country  or  persons  therein. More to the point and less es oteric in argument, is Cuba's violation  of  two conventions  to which  it has  agreed. Cuba is a party to the Single  Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the  Convention  on  Psychotropic  Sub stances, both of which Cuba flouts by  its drug activities.  It is for these reasons that I am sub mitting concurrent resolutions calling  for the President to bring before the  United Nations and Organization of  American States the issue of Cuban in volvement in drug trafficking.  Mr. President, I urge a united show  of outrage. I call upon my colleagues  to join me in cosponsoring these reso lutions and in turning the world spot light on Cuba's heinous criminality.e  SENATE  RESOLUTION  308-RE LATING  TO  THE  CONTINU ATION OF UNIVERSAL  TELE PHONE SERVICE  Mr. STEVENS submitted the follow ing resolution; which was referred to  the Committee on Commerce, Science,  and Transportation:  S.

34,249,1,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, I  regret to inform my colleagues in the  House of Representatives of the loss  of one of my congressional staff mem bers. Francine Susan Freedman was a  professional  congressional  legislative  aide since 1974 and a member of my  Washington staff since last year. She  was 32 years old when she died on Jan uary 18, 1984, following a brief illness.  Francine will be greatly missed by  her many friends and her loving par ents, Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Freedman  of Chevy Chase,  and her brother,  Steven of Arlington.  Francine was born and  raised  in  Washington. She graduated from Be thesda-Chevy Chase High School and  the University of Maryland, where she  majored in political science. Francine  was a dedicated congressional employ ee. Through her various duties and re sponsibilities  in  my  congressional  office she put the theory into action  that one person can indeed make a dif ference. Every day she put forth her  best efforts to see that the needs of  the people of New Mexico's Third  Congressional District were being met  by a compassionate Federal Govern ment.  Francine was also a past president of  the Habirah chapter of B'nai B'rith  and was  active  in  the Capitol Hill  group of the United Jewish Appeal.  Her strong interest in the affairs of  Israel carried over into her work. She  was  particularly  active  in  helping  Soviet Jews emigrate and she served as  a  highly  valuable  resource  person  dealing with the current state of af fairs in the Middle East. She worked  long hours aiding constituents in cut ting through bureaucratic redtape and  kept a close watch over our operations  in New Mexico to insure that Govern ment was responsive to the taxpayers.  We consider ourselves fortunate to  have known her and to have had her  as our friend.  We will always treasure our relation ship with her and we will remember  her with special affection in the years  to come.  Our sorrow is tempered only by our  fond memories of her bright spirit and  her dedication to helping others. She  leaves a  legacy that all of us should  hope to emulate.  To her parents and to her family, we  extend our heartfelt and our deepest  sympathies.  TWENTY-FOUR HOUR VOTING ITS TIME HAS COME  <Mr. BlAGG! asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1984
35,249,1,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, Our Na tion's current election process is fail ing us miserably. The 1980 U.S. voter  turnout rate of 52.6 percent was the  lowest for a Presidential election since  1948. Further, voter participation in  our country is more than 30 percent age points lower than the average for  other Western democracies. These are  alarming facts, particularly as we ap proach the November elections.  Today, I am introducing a bill to im prove this bleak situation by providing  for ""same time"" 24-hour voting. The  polling  places  across  the  country  would open on a Sunday at 3 p.m.,  eastern standard time, and would close  24 hours later. These changes would  apply for a 6-year experimental period  beginning with the 1984 Presidential  election.  Under our current system, 80 per cent of  the normal 13-hour voting  period falls during the time our Na tion's work force is either at their jobs  or commuting to and from their jobs.  A 24-hour voting period, starting on a  nonwork day, would solve that incon venience problem. Futher, simultane ous opening and closing of the polls  would eliminate early election projec tions by the media.  Simply put,  the removal of voting  barriers should be viewed as a non partisian  issue worthy of bipartisan  support.  0 1230  MARINES  SHOULD  BE WITH DRAWN FROM LEBANON AND  THEIR  INDEFENSmLE  POSI TION  <Mr. NELSON of Florida asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)

36,249,1,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. Speak er,  last September  I voted  for and  spoke  for  the authorization for  the  President to keep the marines in Leba non up to 18 months.  In my judgment circumstances have  considerably changed since that legis lation was before the Congress and my  conclusion is, and I shared this with  my  constituents  before  Christmas,  that we should withdraw our marines  from Lebanon, put them on the ships,  preferably replace them and the other  high visibility  targets  such  as  the  French with an international peace keeping force such as under the flag of  the United Nations.  Marines cannot fulfill  the purpose  and the role for which they were origi nally sent to Lebanon because  they  have become the targets. They cannot  be the peacekeepers they want to be.  Furthermore,  the marines are  frus trated because the marines are taught  to be an assault force, to take the high  ground, and they are kept on the low  ground in an indefensible position. We  should withdraw our marines.  Lastly,  I  appreciate my colleague  from Florida <Mr. GIBBONS)  for his  statement before this House last Sep tember. I now agree with him.

37,249,1,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, one of  the most important items before the  Senate is the replacement of the At torney General. The Senate will soon  have to decide, ""Is Ed Meese qualified  to hold the highest law enforcement  position in this country?""  I say that the answer to this ques tion is ""No."" Mr. Meese was behind  the administration's recent attempt to  gut the Civil Rights Commission. Mr.  Meese has engineered three proposals  to put the Legal Services Corporation  out of business, ending legal aid to the  poor.  Mr. Meese's contempt  for  critical  civil rights initiatives-like affirmative  action-is well known. And yet Ronald  Reagan wants  to put Mr. Meese  in  charge of enforcing the Nation's civil  rights laws.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I urge  the Senate to reject Ed Meese's nomi nation  for Attorney General.  4  weeks ago, Ed Meese could not find  hunger in America, can we now trust  him to find justice in our country?

I want to com mend the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Subcommittee on Energy  Conservation and Power, Mr. OrriN GER, for his outstanding work and lead ership on this important legislation.  H.R. 2615 authorizes the low-income  weatherization program through 1994,  establishes a goal of weatherizing all  eligible homes by 1994, and makes a  number of cost saving improvements  in the program. The bill also calls on  the Department of Energy to submit a  plan for  the  implementation of the  ambitious 10 year weatherization pro gram and requires that the President  identify necessary funding for the pro gram in his budget submissions. For  the last 3 years, the President has pro posed  to  terminate  the  low-income  weatherization program.  For an administration that claims to  be concerned with  slowing Govern ment spending,  I  am somewhat dis mayed  by  their  opposition  to  the  weatherization program. While H.R.  2615 authorizes $500 million in fiscal  year 1984 and 1985 and such sums nec essary  through fiscal year 1994,  the  long-term savings  this program will  bring are evident. Poor households fre quently have the highest energy bills  because they cannot afford to weath erize their homes.  Improving energy  conservation  in  low-income  families  will substantially reduce the need to  subsidize their fuel bills. Weatherizing  the homes of poor Americans saves an  average of $225 per house each year  for 20 years. The President's opposi tion to the weatherization program is  just another example of this adminis tration being penny wise and pound  foolish.  Mr. Chairman, not only will this leg islation provide funding to weatherize  low-income homes across the country,  to  it will create thousands of new job op portunities. While the current weath erization program produces  roughly  5,200  jobs,  the  revitalized  program  under  this bill will create close  66,000  jobs each year.  In addition,  H.R. 2615 will require each State to  submit a plan for training weatheriza tion workers to insure efficient and ef fective use of Federal money.  In my homestate of New Mexico, un employment has  fallen slightly, but  the number of jobless remain far too  high. Hundreds of low-income house holds are being hit with high energy  bills each month due to the unusually  cold winter. While  these New Mexi cans accept  the Government checks  out of necessity, they would like noth ing more than to be able to pay their  own bills. The weatherization and em ployment act will put New Mexicans  back to work and reduce the energy  bills of those less fortunate, thereby  saving  the  Federal  Government  money.  Mr. Chairman,  I urge members to  vote for this sound and pragmatic leg islation.  ",1984

42,262,1,Mr. BLILEY.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Weaterization and Employment  Act. Amid  all  of  the  caterwauling  about a  balanced budget, awash  in  crocodile  tears  in a  campaign year  against the Reagan deficit, the majori ty party  in  this House urges us  to  embark upon a  program which,  to  achieve marginal energy savings, will  probably cost the Federal Government  over $23 billion in the next 10 years.  Last year at this time we stampeded  through a  jobs bill, through we were  unable to get the money spent before  unemployment  began  to  plummet.  That bill contained $100 million  in  emergency  weatherization  funds.  Much of that has not even been spent,  but we are asked in this bill to make  that $100 million and some additional  funds recovered from oil overcharges a  part of the inviolable base which we  can never cut.  We should not be shocked at the du plicity in claiming that this half a bil lion dollar program is not an increase.  We should not be shocked that it is  $200 million over the majority's own  first budget resolution: That kind of  thing is all too common. We should,  however, be shocked, or at least given  reason to pause at the overall cost of  this program. The CBO estimates that  the bill will triple in cost to $1.6 billion  by 1987 and will double again the next  year to $3.2 billion. The administra tion estimates that the 10 year program called for  in this bill will cost  $23.1 billion. My colleagues, this is no  minor assistance package. It is a signif",1984

It  ",1984
47,275,1,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Chairman, this  is  a  technical amendment.  is an  amendment to the provision in the bill  which  requires  the  Secretary  of  Energy  to  solicit State applications  and disburse funds to the States in a  timely  fashion. Under  the  bill  as  adopted by the committee, if the pro gram year starts on January 1, as it  has in past years, the Secretary would  solicit applications by the previous Oc tober and start disbursing funds by  the 1st of January and finish disburse ment by  the 1st of July. Since we  drafted the bill, the Department has  changed the start of the program year  to April. This amendment is intended  to update this bill. It would remove  the mention  of  specific  dates  and  specify instead that solicitation of ap plications must  take place 90  days  before the start of the program year,  that DOE must commence disburse ment of funds by the start of the pro gram year and complete such disburse ment within 180 days after the start of  the program year. The schedule is the  same as that now in the current bill,  but without mention of specific dates  because those dates are now inappro priate, as I indicated, because of action  taken by the Department of Energy to  change the program year.  This is an important provision, since  for at least 2 years in a row the admin istration has failed to disburse weath erization funds to the States until 3 or  more months after the start of the  program year, causing major disrup tion and layoffs in the program.  Mr. Chairman,  I urge adoption of  the amendment.  0 1440  ",1984

He certainly is to be commended for  this amendment.  No one can say that the Congress is  giving  away  its  authority  by  this  amendment because we always have  the power to override any vetoes that  are made by the President.  0 1650  We also have  to approve any ex penditures before  they are made by  the President. We are not giving away  our authority, but we are telling the  President where  there  is  a waste,  where you feel that the money is not  necessary, you can strike it from the  bill and then sign the bill into law. In  this way, we will  eliminate many  vetoes of major pieces of  legislation  that we perhaps do not want vetoed  ourselves and give  the President the  right to sign a bill into law that will be  beneficial to the whole country.

53,288,1,Mr. MOORHEAD., It is not available  for  this  reason. Bills  come  to  the  President that he has to veto because  they go beyond the level that he is  willing to sign into law.  ,1984

I want to make it clear for those who  could hear over the tumultuous crowd  that we have here that the amendI  ment clearly outlines the override pro cedure. All this is is simply Franklin  Roosevelt's  line-item-veto  proposal  that was adopted by  this House on  January 11, 1938, by a voice vote.  My point is this. It is too late to help  Roosevelt with his problem. It is not  too late to help Ronald Reagan with  it.  What this would do is provide line item vetoes, something that exists in  44 of our States, where Governors can  engage in a  line-item veto and then  the Congress can, if it wishes, override  that veto.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1984

58,288,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1984
59,288,1,Mr. MOORHEAD., I yield to the gen tleman from Pennsylvania.  ,1984
60,288,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Chairman,  the  gentleman from Texas just made an  excellent point. In 44 of our States,  the Governors  have  this  kind  of  power. It is not seen in those States as  being an abrogation of legislative au thority. It is seen as a prudent way of  managing budgets that tend to get out  of control.  It  is  interesting  that  in all  those  States, they also have balanced-budget  proposals. Those States are able then  to maintain a balanced budget within  the framework of the legislature and  the executive, working together. That  is all that this particular amendment  foresees, that in this one narrow cate gory and hopefully  in other bills  in  the future we will give the President  that line-item authority, give him the  same authority that a number of Gov ernors have used  to get  their fiscal  house in order.  In the State of California, the Gov ernor there was able to use that au thority very effectively to get a fiscal  house in order that was very badly out  of control. This President should have  that kind of authority as well.  I would hope that this Congress will  not refuse to grant some very limited  ability of the President to go through  with a red pencil and knock out items  that he believes are adding to the na tional debt in an irresponsible way.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1984
61,288,1,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words and I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, it is simply amazing  to me that in their zeal to hurt those  who need help, some Members of this  House are coming up with the most  tortured and illogical arguments that I  have ever heard.  I am just trying to say that I am  amazed by the illogical and tortured  arguments  that are being  raised by  some Members on that side in their  effort to balance a budget, reduce the  deficit, but  those efforts are almost  solely and exclusively confined to pro grams that are beneficial to people.  Now, for example, to raise an argu ment that 44 States have some kind of  arrangement like this, in my opinion,  is really almost fallacious. When did  44 States set  the example  for  the  House of Representatives? This  is a  unique and distinct body, with the ul timate  responsibility  for  national  spending, National Government.  In addition to that, I am amazed by  some Members on the other side and  others in the Republican Party who  seemingly now are doing nothing but  quoting  from  former  Democratic  Presidents. I heard the present Presi dent quote the great statements that  were made by John Kennedy and now  I heard this gentleman saying he was  not around to help Roosevelt.  You know, this old business of trying  to mix in past heroes of the Democrat ic Party with an unreasoned attack on  those who are disadvantaged  in this  Nation is not going to sell. It is simply  not going to sell. Quote all you want  from past Democratic Presidents, all  that you do, whether you are a newly  arrived Republican, or an old line Re publican, or a changed over Republi can, it is not going to sell.  Finally, let me make one more point.  If we do this, if we were to accept this  amendment,  then you will say  that  there  is no need for an authorizing  committee, because a President can  come back through and line item out  everything that an authorizing com mittee would have done. We the au thorizing  committees will  be  there  simply going through an exercise  in  futility. There is no need for this.  If the gentlemen who support this  amendment  and  the maker of  the  amendment believe that suddenly the  Appropriations Committee is going to  become so magnanimous  in funding  everything that passes in this House  as an authorization bill, if you believe  that, then you might have some argu ment for your amendment, but you  know that is not going to happen. You  know that every authorization that we  have acted on has been cut by an Ap propriations Committee.  In your zeal to hurt those who are  poor  in  this Nation, do not destroy  this institution.  I vigorously oppose the amendment.  I hope it will be overwhelmingly de feated.  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to rise in  support of H.R. 2615, the Weatheriza tion and Employment Act of 1983.  This measure deserves our full support  since its enactment will impact both  the critical need for increased energy  efficiency and  the necessity  for  in creasing employment opportunities.  It is imperative that we move aggres sively  to  tie  such  cost-effective  projects as weatherization to the cre ation of  jobs. The weatherization of  ",1984

65,301,1,Mr. SENSENBRENNER.," Mr. Speak er, as a Member of Congress, I did not  enter into the debate on the ERA as  an opponent. As a member of the Wis consin Assembly  in 1972,  I voted  to  ratify ERA  I  also cosponsored a  State ERA which passed the legisla ture but was subsequently defeated in  a referendum vote.  Back in July, when the House Judi ciary Subcommittee on Civil and Con stitutional Rights began hearings on  House  Joint Resolution 1,  the pro posed  equal  rights  amendment,  I  noted that the failure of ERA I was a  direct result of the amendment's pro ponents' inability  to answer critical  questions  on many  emotional  and  social  issues that it created. Perhaps  the most controversial of these social  issues  is  the effect  the ERA would  have on abortion and abortion-related  issues. This first,  in a series of nine  special orders over the next 3 months,  will deal with the oft-quoted phrase  ""the ERA-abortion""  connection and  the merits  of  an  abortion-neutral  amendment.  As currently phrased, it is unclear  whether  the proposed  equal  rights  amendment will have any effect on  abortion rights or laws-most impor tantly, the Hyde amendment or simi lar State laws or regulations that pro hibit public money from being used  for abortion funding.  When House Joint Resolution 1 was  before the full House Committee on  the Judiciary, I offered an amendment  which was defeated which would make  the ERA abortion-neutral. The text of  this amendment is as follows:  Nothing in this Article shall be construed  to grant, secure or deny any right relating  to abortion or the funding thereof.  This amendment will again be of fered if the ERA is considered under  an open or modified open rule.  The ERA-abortion connection was  first raised by advocates of abortion  who attempted  to use  the ERA's in  State constitutions of Hawaii, Massa chusetts, and Pennsylvania  to over turn State laws that prohibited State  public moneys  from being used  for  abortions. While  the courts decided  these cases on other grounds, the issue  was never decided whether a State  ERA would or would not overturn  these statutes. After these suits were  filed, in many States where the Feder al ERA had not been  ratified,  the  abortion connection became one of the  major reasons for failure. There is no  reason  to believe  that similar argu ments would not be made before Fed eral courts should the ERA become  part of the Constitution.  The principal  argument  that has  been advanced against an abortion neutral amendment  is  that  the Su preme Court has treated abortion as a  privacy right and not an equal protec tion issue. This is merely an attempt  to cloud the issue. While it is true that  the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld  the right to abortion under the priva cy penumbra it is also true that the  Supreme Court in the case of Harris v.  McRae, 448 .U.S. 297 (1980), upheld the  constitutionality of the Hyde amend ment. In the McRae case, the Court  concluded that the Hyde amendment  did not violate equal protection princi ples. The Court concluded the Hyde  amendment did not violate equal pro tection principles because  it did not  disadvantage  a  suspect  class where  strict  judicial scrutiny would apply.  The Supreme Court went on to hold  that there was a rational basis for the  Hyde amendment: ""It follows that the  Hyde  amendment,  by  encouraging  childbirth except in the most urgent  circumstances, is rationally related to  the legitimate government objective of  protection  of human  life."" McRae,  supra, at 325. This case was decided by  a razor-thin margin of 5-4.  In William v. Zabraz, 448 U.S. 297,  which was decided on the same day,  the Supreme Court held that a State  statute similar  to  the Federal Hyde  amendment did not violate the consti tutional restrictions of the equal pro tection clause of the 14th amendment.  What is important in these cases is  that the Supreme Court held that sex  was not a suspect class that would be  subject to strict judicial scrutiny.  It has been argued and testified to  by proponents of the ERA that the  ERA will have no impact on abortion  or abortion funding because pregnan cy is a unique physical characteristic  shared only by one sex and would not  be an issue for sex discrimination.  However, in an amicus brief filed in  the General Electric v. Gilbert case,  429 U.S.  125 <1976), by  the  leading  legal scholars who favor the ERA, it  was argued that pregnancy was no dif ferent than any other temporary dis ability. The issue in the Gilbert case  was whether  a  disability  insurance  coverage program offered by General  Electric, which did not include preg nancy  coverage, was  discrimination  and thus in violation of title VII of the  1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits  sex discrimination in employment.  That the arguments in the amicus  brief relating to title VII on pregnancy  discrimination are applicable  to  the  ERA  is  clearly  established  by  the  amici when they stated:  In this brief, amicus draws upon its exper tise in the theory of the equal rights amend ment and in the policies at issue here to  present to the Court an argument that the  legislative history of  the ERA  supports,  rather  than negates  the conclusion  that  Title VII prohibits the exclusion of preg nancy-related disabilities from the General  Electric disability income protection plan.  The amicus brief filed by the ACLU  and  the Women's Law project was  signed by Prof. Thomas Emerson of  Yale Law School  and Prof. Anne  Freedman  of  Rutgers  University  School of Law, both of whom testified  before the Subcommittee on Civil and  Constitutional Rights in favor of the  ERA. It was stated that:  . . .  in line with the central tenet of the  ERA-that legal support for sex discrimina tion is to be eradicated root and branch Congress clearly intended the amendment  to end all categorical discrimination by law,  including the improper use of pregnancy based classification.  ... The condition of pregnancy, for exam ple, possesses a number of properties, some  of them shared by other conditions <need  for medical care, period of disability), and  some, wholly unique <the birth of a child is  the usual result). The uterus,  too, shares  some characteristics with other organs <sub ject to disease and malfunction>, and has  some features wholly unique to it ....  Amici argued that if General Elec tric were a State employer subject to  the ERA its treatment of disability re lated  to  pregnancy  and  childbirth  would not survive scrutiny appropriate  under the <Equal Rights Amendment).  In testimony before the Subcommit tee on Civil and Constitutional Rights,  the American Bar Association was  very  critical  of  the U.S.  Supreme  Court's decision in the Gilbert case:  The Supreme Court reasoned ... that dif ferent treatment of pregnancy from other  disabilities  is not discrimination based on  sex but simply discrimination based on preg nancy. Accordingly, a legislature can distin guish between pregnant and non-pregnant  people  and  perpetrate  no  legal wrong  against women. This denial of the obvious  fact that to treat people differently on ac count of characteristics unique to one sex is  to  treat them differently on the basis of  their sex places beyond reach of the equal  protection clause some of the most invidious  and detrimental sex role stereotyping.  It takes little imagination to see that  legislative  restricitons  on  public  ",1984

The occasion will celebrate his  completion of 22 years as a member of  the Wilkes-Barre Area Board of Edu cation and its predecessor, the Plains  Township School Board.  During his  service on  the Plains  board, Henry was  treasurer  for  7  years. When the Greater Wilkes-Barre  area board was formed by jointure of  several communities, Henry was elect ed as an original member of the larger  board. In 1977-78 and, again, in 198182,  he  served as president of  that  board.  During his tenure, Henry served as  chairman  of  the  administration-in struction committee and was a very  active member of the athletic commit tee.  Mr. Manarski  leaves  the Wilkes Barre Area Board of Education with  every reason to feel that his has been  a job well done. During his tenure, the  board underwent many difficult situa tions and embarked upon an ambitious  construction program. In all ways, the  Wilkes-Barre Area Board of Education  is better and stronger today because of  Henry Manarski's dedicated participa tion.  is my  pleasure,  therefore,  to  salute my friend Henry on his nearly  one-quarter  century  of  service  to  American education and to pay trib ute, as well, to his wife, Leona, and his  three  children: Karen, Debra  and  Mark, whose  steadfast  support has  made possible his many community  contributions.

67,327,1,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, I  take  this  opportunity  to  commend  the  senior citizens of Gloucester Township  for their impressive display of human ity and compassion at the outbreak of  a fire at the Franklin Square Senior  Citizen Complex just before the holi days. This fire, which gutted several  apartments in the complex and forced  elderly  residents  to  flee  for  their  safety, displaced 10 elderly residents.  The concern shown by other elderly  residents of  the complex  is  indeed  heartwarming.  I  laud  the efforts of  those senior citizens, as well as those  of Anna Mae Redrow, the coordinator  of  the Hider Lane Senior Citizen  Center, who were ready to help their  neighbors  in a  time of need. These  fine and upstanding citizens helped  place those residents displaced by the  fire  in a nearby motel and gave of  themselves  to  insure  that  the  dis placed seniors were made comfortable  in their new surroundings. In addition  to  coordinating  fundraising  drives,  they helped gather furniture and ap-  pliances for the unfortunate who lost  all their possessions in the fire.  At a time when budget cuts are im pinging on the already meager income  afforded  to our Nation's senior citi zens, a  tragedy such as the Franklin  Square fire could have had devastat ing effects on the elderly residents. In stead, because of the selflessness ex hibited by the unharmed residents of  Franklin Square, and because of the  love and concern that guided the ef forts of friends and neighbors, the el derly residents, whose lives were dis rupted by the fire, found solace in the  goodwill of their neighbors.  I hope my colleagues will join me in  praising the senior citizens of Franklin  Square for their courage and compas sion. Mr. Speaker, I would like to com mend the following editorial, from the  Observer, to the attention of my col leagues:  [From the Observer, Gloucester Twp., N.J.)  AN EDITORIAL: GLO. TwP. SENIORS SET  EXAMPLE FOR ALL  in  Senior citizens  in Gloucester Township  are proving  that  they have no  room for  apathy  their  lives.

The  senior citizens offered more  than  mere sympathy when fire forced 10 persons  to flee the Franklin Square Senior Citizen  Complex a few weeks ago. Six persons have  since returned to their apartments. Howev er, four are still residing at the Holiday Inn  while their apartments are being repaired.  ",1984

The  theme:  ""Rethinking  Dream, Not Forgotten.""  Mr. Speaker, I would like to share  the contents of my January 16, 1984,  a  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  statement, with my colleagues here in  the Congress today.  The statement follows:  IN HONOR OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.  It is with great respect and admiration  that I pay tribute to the memory and teach ings of one of America's most outstanding  moral crusaders and civil rights leaders on  this annual memorial celebration.  Perhaps the most important legacy of Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., is that, while he  gave so much to humanity during this life time,  there remains so much more  to be  gained-if we will but listen  to him once  more. The theme: ""Rethinking a dream, not  forgottten"" is a most fitting one, because al ready  there  is a generation whose knowl edge of Dr. King is a blurring recollection of  someone in American history who spoke out  against racial segregation. This dream must  not be  forgotten, because, as my  friend  Andrew Young once put it, Dr. King's mes sage ""endures, spanning the seas and calling  out to each new generation.""  By furthering the civil rights of American  blacks, Dr. King contributed to the cause of  freedom  for  all Americans,  regardless of  race or creed. By strengthening the cause of  justice, he inspired millions throughout the  world in mankind's common aspirators. His  message of redemption and reconciliation is  no less meaningful  today than during his  lifetime. His life's work and unyielding ad herence to achieving social change through  nonviolence  serves  as  a  great  example  during these turbulent and troubled times.  The enactment of Federal legislation last  year, has finally made commemoration of.  Dr. King's birthday a permanent  reality.  This, indeed, marks a milestone in our con tinuing efforts to bring about a truly plural istic society based on mutual respect for one  another. Bestowing this honor on Dr. King,  not only  transcends his status as a black  civil rights leader, it serves as recognition  that he spoke as an American about the  spiritual liberation of all people. He spoke  of brotherhood, of an end to poverty, of jus tice, of peace to you, yes, but also to me and  to all mankind.e  AN INSIDERS VIEW OF OUR  NATION'S CLASSROOMS  HON. BARBARA B.

This opinion piece  was authored by a history teacher of  24  years, Wayne Loveland, of Hall  High School in West Hartford, Conn.  Mr. Loveland addresses something  I  believe all of us will have cause and  need  to address  in  this coming ses sion-how  to  right what has  gone  wrong  in  our  public  educational  system. I hope that Mr. Loveland, and  other dedicated teachers like him, will  continue to provide us with an insider's view of our Nation's classrooms.  The article follows:  January 24, 1984  [From the Hartford Courant, Jan. 10, 1984]  DoN'T BLAME TEACHERS IF THE PAPERBOY  HASN'T HEARD OF MUSSOLINI  <By Wayne Loveland>  Prominent among the barrage of criticism  being leveled at our public schools lately is  the charge, or implication, that the root of  the problem is inadequate teaching.  Having  served  in classrooms  in  several  communities for more than three decades, I  consider  this  an  incorrect  assumption.  There are indeed some mediocre teachers in  our schools, but  they are  the exception  rather than the rule. The academic creden tials and personal qualities of the teachers  with whom I associate compare favorably  with those of other professionals in the pri vate sector of our economy.  The principal factors that have contribut ed  to scholastic decline can be  traced  to  changes that have occurred beyond the con fines of the school buildings. Teachers have  not caused these changes, and should not be  regarded as architects of academic mediocri ty. Rather, our educators are the principal  victims of this decline.  There is today considerably less structure  and  order  throughout our  society  than  there was two decades ago.  More young people attend our nation's  schools, for longer periods of time, than in  any advanced country in the world. In 1980  close to 95 percent of our teenagers were in  school, compared to 60 percent in England  and 40 percent in West Germany. Some of  these young people are congenitally un equipped to learn in any traditional sense.  Yet another percentage of pupils is largely  uninterested in academics for a variety of  reasons.  Our schools are not only educational insti tutions but ""holding stations'' for society.  The present-day educator must often serve  as social worker, warden and teacher. Sub stantial tensions result from these multiple  responsibilities.  Several specific factors have contributed  to the decline in academic performance. The  sometimes negative impact of television  is  clear  to everyone. The passive sedentary  patterns acquired in childhood become in grained over the years. Television has also  accustomed students to fast-paced, rapidly  shifting presentations and programs. These  are in stark contrast to the seemingly prosa ic and pedestrian presentations of the class room  teacher. Even a Robert Redford or  Dolly Parton would have difficulty main taining  student  interest while  discussing  math  sets or Woodrow Wilson's  foreign  policy five times a day five times a week.  I  suggest  that  some  laymen who  are  among the most critical of teacher perform ance should try secondary  teaching for a  period of two or three months in order to  properly evaluate their personal magnetism.  The serious erosion of our religious and  family structures has also adversely affect ed student performance. In 1979 nearly 40  percent of our nation's children belonged to  single  parent  families. Other marriages  which are officially intact are de facto oper ational failures. The child who comes  to  school from a broken or unhappy home is  not particularly enthusiastic about review ing the historical subtleties of the postwar  world. The cold war in his own home domi nates his thinking-both within and without  the classroom.  1980s learn little of an informational nature  Furthermore, most young adults of  the  from  their parents,  let alone  from  their  grandparents and other relatives.

70,353,1,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, in 1974,  my congressional district Service Acad emy Review Board interviewed many,  many fine students who were seeking  a  congressional  nomination  to  our  military academies. Although our can didates are generally of a high caliber,  there was one young man that year  who stood out from  the crowd, and  who displayed leadership and a poten tial for service that earmarked him as  a young man with a bright future.  I was  proud  to  concur with  the  advice of our review board and named  Dyke Harrison Whitbeck as my princi pal nominee  to  the U.S. Air Force  Academy  that  year.  Having  just  turned 18, Dyke had already earned an  outstanding  reputation at  the War wick Valley High School, for his ex ceptional academic standing,  for his  leadership as a member of his student  seenate and as his junior class presi dent, and as a member of the baseball,  football, basketball, and soccer teams.  The Air Force Academy concurred  with my nomination, and Dyke WhitEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  beck was admitted to the class of 1978.  I followed his career at the Academy  with keen interest, for I was confident  that this was a young man who would  be a credit to his academy and to his  Nation.  Upon graduat!ng from the Academy,  I was pleased to learn that Dyke Whit beck subsequently rose to the rank of  captain in the Air Force.  Two weeks ago, I accompanied sever al of my  colleagues on  the House  Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse  and Control on our fact-finding mis sion  to Asia. While we were seeking  ways to stem the tide of illicit narcot ics with officials from other lands, we  received word  that a U.S. Air Force  helicopter had crashed while trying to  interdict a drug dropoff in the Baha mas. It was especially poignant that  the news was received by us at that  time and under those circumstances,  for we were trying to impress upon the  leaders of our host nations the serious ness  and  the determination of  the  United States  in  the war we  are  waging  to stem  the  illicit narcotics  trade. Saddened as we were by the loss  of five of our finest Air Force men, we  were able  to  inform our hosts  that  many, many courageous public serv ants are risking their lives to stop the  disease of narcotics trafficking.  It was not until I returned home this  week that I  learned that one of our  missing Air Force officers was Capt.  Dyke H. Whitbeck.  When  I called Captain Whitbeck's  parents to express my. personal sense  of loss, I was impressed by their cour age  through  this  heartwrenching  ordeal. It was as if they were saying  that Dyke did not give his life in vain;  that by helping to halt the flow of  narcotics into our Nation, his life may  well have been given  to save other  lives.  Mr. Speaker,  the Whitbeck  family  has suffered a great personal loss, but  so has our Nation. Capt. Dyke Whit beck should be remembered as an out standing public servant whose life was  tragically lost in our war against nar cotics. He should be remembered as a  symbol of our Nation's determination  to halt this threat to the very fabric of  our society.e  A TRIBUTE TO MR. CHARLES G.  DAVIS, SR.: AN OUTSTANDING  EDUCATOR  HON. WILLIAM (BILL) CLAY  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 24, 1984  e ",1984
71,353,1,Mr. CLAY.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to share with you and my col leagues an article that appeared in the  St. Louis American on Thursday, Jan uary 12, 1984, concerning the death of  Mr. Charles G. <Chappie) Davis, Sr.,  351  an outstanding and dedicated father,  teacher, and school administrator  in  the city of St. Louis.  Mr. Davis  had many  accomplish ments  in both his professional and  personal life that brought him many  awards and recognitions.  During his lifespan, Mr. Davis was  an  inspiration  to  thousands of St.  Louisan whose  lives he affected and  will be missed dearly.  The following is the article:  Charles Davis, more affectionately known  as ""Chappie"" was a native St. Louisan and  was a product of the St. Louis Public School  System. He attended and graduated from  Charles Sumner as an honor student. He  was on the Dean's Roll during his entire col lege career at Stowe Teacher's College and  received a Masters Degree in Education for  the  University  of  Illinois,  Champagne  Urbana, Illinois.  Chappie was well  liked by  friends and  family because of his witty and charming  to  personality and his continuous efforts  serve the community in trying to improve  the educational  system  in our area. He  shared his academic skills and experience  while dedicating his life to youth serving as  a teacher and administrator for many years.  He served in an administrative capacity at  the Sumner Elementary Center, Beaumont  Elementary Center, and the Lincoln Insti tute Summer Program. He also served as  principal of Emerson, Mitchell and Dewey  Elementary School.  Davis was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi  Fraternity, The Nuclues Club  and The  Royal Vagabonds. His professional  affili ations included the Administrators Associa tion of St. Louis Public Schools, Local 44,  The International Reading Association, The  Na~onal Education Association  and The  Missouri State Teachers Association. He was  also an active member of St. Philips Lu theran Church where he  served  as  the  Chairman of the Finance Committee.  Chappie  is  survived by his wife, Agnes  Williamson-Davis who is also an educator in  the St. Louis Public School System, a son,  Charles G. Davis, Jr. who is a student at the  Southern lllinois University School of Den tistry at Alton, Illinois and a daughter Dr.  Carole Annette Davis, a graduate of Me harry Dental School who is currently com pleting a general residency at the Michael  Reese Hospital Complex in Chicago, Illinois.  Funeral services were held Monday, Janu ary 9, 1984 at 7:00 p.m. at St. Philips Lu theran Church in North St. Louis. The body  was  interred Tuesday morning at Calvary  Cemetary. Services were provided by Cun ningham and Moore Mortuary. Contribu tions to the Heart Fund Society will be ac cepted by St. Philips Lutheran Church in  the name of Charles G.

We ask and  implore  the  gentleman's  assistance  in  speedily  bringing up  the next  legislation  so  that we might try and assist farmers  in need in his area and in my area and  thoughout the United States.  ",1984
74,366,1,Mr. WALKER.," I  thank the gentle man, but it still gets to the point that  we did have an opportunity here this  afternoon to be considering that disas ter legislation on the floor. The priori ty decided by whatever leadership was  that we will not consider the agricul tural disasters of the country; instead,  we will consider a $10 million study  program on organic farming.  I  think that the agricultural inter ests in the country ought to know and  understand that that was the priority;  that it was more important today to  have this study program on the floor  than  to deal with agricultural disas ters across  the country. That is  the  sense of priorities  that bothers me,  and  I  think, Mr. Chairman,  it  is a  sense of priorities  that will bother  some of the agricultural interests of  the country.  ",1984

76,366,1,Mr. WALKER., I will be glad to yield  to the gentleman from Texas.  ,1984
77,366,1,Mr. DE LA GARZA., The bill does not  provide for additional funding;  it re lates only to determination of an ap plicant's eligibility for disaster loan as sistance. The Department was not co operative with how we wanted to de termine eligibility. That is really the  only thing that it does. It does not add  additional funding.  The CHAIRMAN.

Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentle man from Texas for his explanation,  but I would remind the membership  that we do have  the ability on this  floor to amend the bills that come out  under Calendar Wednesday,  if  there  were some problems with the Depart ment, we could have still dealt with  the disaster portions of the program  and with amendments perhaps speak ing to the needs of the people in my  area, the needs of the people in the  gentleman's area in Texas, the needs  of the people in the area of the gentle man from Florida.  D 1610  All of these things could have been  dealt with here on the floor today in a  disaster program. We do not have the  opportunity  to do  that because,  in stead, we are considering a bill of a  more narrow nature than the all-en compassing kind of a bill we could  have had before us.  ",1984
80,366,1,Mr. DE  LA GARZA.," Mr. Chairman,  will the gentleman yield?  ",1984
81,366,1,Mr. WALKER.," I will yield in just a  moment.  Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that is  the sense of priorities that bothers me,  and  I would hope perhaps  in  the  future, as this kind of procedure takes  place in the future, as this procedure  takes place,  that we might want  to  consider major  legislation of  impor tance  to  the entire country  rather  than very narrow legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I am now very glad to  yield to the gentleman from Texas.  ",1984
82,366,1,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," Mr. Chairman, I  want  to agree with  the gentleman.  The gentleman  is eminently correct.  My good friend, as always, offers very  cosntructive criticism.  We erred. I want the gentleman now  to assist us next Wednesday. We will  have that legislation next Wednesday,  and I hope the gentleman will assist  us. One week is not going to matter  that much, and if the procedure con tinues next Wednesday,  I hope  the  gentleman and I can bring this legisla tion forward and get on with it.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  <Mr.  WALKER) has expired.  ",1984
83,366,1,Mr. DE LA GARZA.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield 3 minutes  to  the distinguished  chairman of  the subcommittee  that  handled  this  legislation,  the gentle man from California <Mr. BROWN).  ",1984
84,366,1,Mr.  BROWN  of  California.," Mr.  Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me this time, and I would first  like  to add my own compliments  to  those already expressed by the gentle man from Oregon <Mr. WEAVER) to the  chairman of the committee for the sig nificant statement that he made ini tially with regard to the significance  of this bill.  I think it is an important bill. It is a  bill, of course, dealing with the future  of this country and the need to con serve energy, to conserve soil, and to  conserve water in order to have  the  kind of productive agriculture 50 years  from now which was so well stated by  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  with regard to the Amish farmers in  his own district. They have been farm ing that land for 300 years and main taining the productivity of that land.  A good share of the land currently  being farmed in this country is being  eroded at the rate of over 5 tons per  year and will not be farmable 50 years  from now, to say nothing of 300 years  from now. We need  the kind of re search that is reflected by this bill.  I would like to point out that in the  subcommittee which I have the honor  to chair, this bill was reported out by a  vote of 9 to 2, including a majority of  the Republicans. In the full committee  it was reported out by a vote of 26 to  10. There really was not that much  controversy in the committee, where  we are familiar with the importance of  this subject.  The controversy arose, the questions  arose, and the negative votes arose be cause the Department was opposed to  it. The Department says that they do  not need the authority, and if it were  all that important, they could be doing  it. And that is true. They were doing  it. The Department of Agriculture had  an excellent program for coordinating  organic farm research in this country.  They issued an excellent report which  stimulated a great deal of interest. It  brought  inquiries  from all over  the  world as to what was being done.  The Department does do research. It  is not necessarily called organic  re search, but it is on farm systems and  on  integrated pest management and  on energy conservation, which is relat ed  to  this  subject. They  had  one  person over there coordinating the re quests for information, and in effect  they fired  that person. There was and I do not think there is any ques tion about this-a desire to downgrade  the posture of this kind of research in  the Department.  There is-and we have to face this some objection  to  this kind of  re search. There is objection from those  in the energy field and the petroleum  field who think that this might dis courage farmers from using as much  oil or diesel fuel as they might like to  sell.

87,405,1,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I  thank  my good and trusted friend from Ari zona for his kind comments. I agree  completely with what he has said.  I also wish to thank my friend from  New Jersey for bringing up the matter  of pension portability. As I said to the  Senate a  few moments  ago,  and  I  repeat, I have carefully reviewed the  developments since our successful ef forts to block the FCC action by send ing S. 1660 to the floor. I think it is ap propriate that I say at this time, Mr.  President, that I have also reviewed,  as a part of the overall bill, the matter  of pension portability and, as did the  Senator  from New  Jersey,  I  have  checked  into  this matter very  thor oughly.  I find that the American Telephone  and Telegraph Co.,  their top leader ship,  in whom I have confidence  in  this area, and also all of their former  operating companies  that have now  been separated from Mother Bell, all  agree that pension portability is some thing that should be recognized. They  have no difficulty with it whatsoever.  I guess  then, after discussing  this  with the representatives of the CW A,  those representing the workers of that  great  system  also  agree  and  seem  united on  the  thought that pension  portability  is and should be kept  in  the final agreement.  Therefore, I  find no differences of  opinion among  the members of  the  Commerce Committee on this particu lar question. Indeed, I find no objec tion by any other Member of the U.S.  Senate. Therefore,  that is one more  thing that has been resolved. And, at  some appropriate time, I can confiden tially predict that there will be no dif ficulty whatsoever in passing legisla tion, if indeed legislation is necessary,  to clear up the matter of pension port ability.  That is just one more reason, I sug gest, that it is not in the interest of  our communications system for us to  proceed any further with S. 1660 that  I strongly supported out of committee.  Because of the recent actions of the  FCC, I  think that legislation at this  time simply is superfluous.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",1984

90,405,1,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  ",1984
91,405,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," With out objection, it is so ordered.  ",1984
92,405,1,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, I have  followed with great interest the debate  over the past few days on the  tele phone bill. I would like to reiterate my  deep affection, high regard, and re spect for the distinguished chairman  of the Commerce Committee and the  manager of the bill that we are consid ering today. We occasionally disagree,  but the point of view that I have from  Illinois is possibly quite different than  it is from other parts of the country.  I pointed out in my comments  the other day, there is a distinct disad vantage  to  Illinois with S. 1660.  It  would cost our State $138 million a  year. It is subsidy to other States. We  have not asked my own native State of  Florida to subsidize our heating bills  despite the fact we have had a rather  intense, bitter cold winter and heating  bills are soaring  in  Illinois. But we  take that as a matter of course. We do  not feel it is right for us in any way to  subsidize  the  telephone  service  of  other parts of the country.  indicated on Monday, there is  no compelling reason for the Senate to  take up S. 1660 in view of the fact that  the FCC has announced that access  charges will be put off for at least 18  months. Again this morning, the FCC  met and reiterated  their decision  to  delay  any  residential  of  single-line  access charges until June 1985.  The FCC has made major conces sions across the board. Not only have  they delayed access charges, they have  come up with a new plan to subsidize  small  rural  telephone companies  to  insure universal service in these areas.  The FCC says it will make major pro visions  to the so-called ENFIA rates  for common carriers. As I have stated  before,  there  is no  reason  for  the  Senate to consider this complex legis lation  for  the sake of adding a  6month delay  in  the access  charges  beyond June 1985.  I believe that the Senate should ad dress concerns expressed by the Com munications Workers of America re garding pension portability, however,  these concerns can be addressed with out taking up all of the other provi sions of S. 1660. I also feel that the  Senate should indicate its support for  life-line services for the poor and el derly of this country who may not be  able to afford the access charges. The  FCC should allow State public utility  commissions  to exempt from paying  access charges those who are not able  to afford them. Here again, however,  the Senate can express its views to the  FCC without  taking  up  S.  1660,  through a sense of the Senate resolu tion.  Certainly, the letter that was limited  by Senator DoLE  in which I  joined,  and with a  total of 32 Senators, was  acted on very promptly and responsi bly  by  the  FCC. Apparently  our  thoughts concurred with the thoughts  they had had because of  the speed  with which they were able to act.  Mr. President, for the past few days  various Senators have stood up on the  floor  to further explain and clarify  what S. 1660 would mean  for  tele phone customers across the country. I  must confess  that  if anything,  the  longer this debate continues, the more  confused everyone is becoming.  I want to make sure that nobody is  confused about one fact: S. 1660, if en acted, would cost telephone users in Il linois, and many other States more  money than the FCC plan. Proponents  of the bill claim that under the FCC  plan, once it is fully implemented, Illi nois is a net loser of about $42 million,  whereas, under S. 1660, Illinois loses  only $17.4 million. The bill's propo nents are, however, leaving out long distance service in their calculations.  The fact is that overall, Illinois loses  about $138 million now. Looking at all  of the figures, Illinois would continue  to lose nearly $100 million more under  S. 1660 than it would under the FCC  plan. Many other States are in a simi lar situation. For example, looking at  only the first year of the FCC plan,  there are 13 States in the Midwest and  Northeast that would lose more under  S. 1660, than under the FCC plan, if  all the figures are considered.  Mr. President,  the history of  this  issue is a long and complicated one. I  would like to discuss how the telecom munications regulatory structure has  evolved, and how it can be changed to  encourage competition.  Until  the late 1950's, the telecom munications industry was almost total ly closed  to competition; and  those  who  provided  telecommunications  products and services were heavily reg ulated.  The development of new  technol ogies, as well as  increased consumer  demand and a shift in regulatory phi losophy,  led a  few entrepreneurs  in  the 1950's to begin seeking the right to  compete. Over the past quarter centu ry,  regulatory  policy  has  changed  slowly in order to allow competition to  develop.  Changes  in regulatory policy have  occurred in three stages. Most major  regulatory decisions between 1958 and  1979 merely established the right of  new entities  to compete  in selected  telecommunications product and geo graphic markets. By 1979, most tele communications markets  had  been  opened up to competition, and the reg ulatory focus shifted to establishing a  new  industry  structure-one  that  ",1984
93,418,1,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President,  al though we are currently enjoying the  fruits of an economic expansion, prob lems persist in our international trade.  If these problems continue, they could  cause a loss of jobs in major U.S. in dustries and abort the recovery.  For example, largely due to differ ences between United States and Japa nese tax policies, as well as due to dif ferences in currency valuation, Japa nese  automakers  currently  enjoy  a  $2,000 competitive advantage over U.S.  carmakers. U.S.  auto manufacturers  are very concerned about  the  long term prospects for the health of their  industry. Over the last several weeks I  have received letters from several of  them. I ask that these letters be re printed in the RECORD.  The letters follow:  CHRYSLER CORP.,  December 12, 1983.  Hon. DAN QUAYLE,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, D. C.  DEAR DAN: On behalf of all of us at Chrys ler, I want you to know how much we appre ciate your leadership in rallying support in  the Senate for your resolution urging con tinuation of the voluntary restraint agree ment on Japanese cars at present  levels.  The speed with which SCR 81  attracted  almost 20 percent of the Senate as biparti san co-sponsors sent a clear message to the  Administration, as well as to the Japanese,  that there is serious concern in the Con gress about the ""un-level playing field"" on  which we compete  in our  trade relations  with Japan.  While we achieved at best a ""limited"" vic tory by having the Administration agree to  about a 10 percent increase in current vol umes for one year, I am confident that your  help as sponsor of SCR 81 was instrumental  in preventing the figure  from going even  higher.  We believe that serious issues relating to  the trade imbalance between Japan and the  United States, the undervalued yen as com pared to the dollar, and the burden of taxes  on domestic auto manufacturers not shared  by  foreign  imports  cannot  be  resolved  within one year. These factors, which have  nothing to do with productivity or quality,  result in a substantial competitive cost ad vantage of about $2,000 for Japanese manu facturers, all to the detriment of our domes tic industry.  The solutions depend upon Government  action in both countries, and there is little  to  indicate  that such  initiatives will  take  place. As a matter of fact, recent press re ports  indicate that Honda,  the most pro gressive of the Japanese manufacturers, is  considering a second car assembly plant in  this country because they believe there will  be  some  sort of export  regulations <i.e.  quotas> for sometime to come. The clear in ference  is  that they also believe  there  is  little chance of meaningful restructuring of  the yen/dollar relationship or equalization  of the tax burdens between the two coun tries in the near future.  It is obvious to me that we must look at  the events of the past few weeks as the  opening round in a continuing campaign to  level  out  the  competitive  playing  field  which is now so sharply tilted in favor of  Japan.  Resolution of these issues and unequivo cal indication from this Administration that  it  is  prepared  to  support continued  re straints until they are resolved is of particu lar concern to Chrysler Corporation in 1984.  We have critical policy decisions to make on  small car production for the 80's and 90's whether to manufacture them in this coun try or source them off shore.  We will be back to you in the first quarter  of 1984 to relate how we can together work  to maintain current employment levels by  addressing these persistent trade problems.  Again, Dan, thanks for your help and sup port-Merry Christmas and best wishes for  a Happy and prosperous New Year!  Sincerely,  LEE IACOCCA.  ESSEX SPECIALTY PRODUCTS, INC.,  CliJton, N.J., December 20, 1983.  Senator DAN QuAYLE,  Indianapolis, Ind.  DEAR  SENATOR QuAYLE: Essex Specialty  Products, Inc. is a supplier to the American  automobile industry. As such, we are direct ly affected by and concerned with automo bile import policies.  We feel that the Japanese automobile in dustry  is competing unfairly. This unfair  competition is resulting in the loss of mil lions of  jobs and serious damage  to our  automobile and  automobile-related  indus tries.  Two examples of the advantages enjoyed  by  the  Japanese  automobile  companies  doing business in America are seen in the  artificially low valuation of the yen and the  Japanese tax policy. Since 1981, the Japa nese have kept the value of their yen artifi cially low as compared to the U.S. dollar.  This has allowed them to sell more cars in  the U.S. at lower prices,  to make higher  profits, and take away our jobs. Japanese  tax policy  then gives manufacturers  an other advantage of about $1,000 for each car  sold in the U.S. By refunding some of the  taxes normally paid in Japan when a car is  exported to America, the Japanese goven ment subsidizes its auto industry.  In addition, for each Japanese car that is  imported, we  lose about $1,700  in federal,  state and local taxes that would have been  paid if the car had been manufactured in  the U.S. Who makes up this difference? The  American taxpayer.  We've all been working hard to produce  high quality, competitive products. But we  need your help  to eliminate some of the  unfair advantages held by  the  Japanese  doing business in America. Without automo bile  restrictions, we may destroy some of  our most important industries and perma nently eliminate millions of jobs.  Sincerely,  W. E. LEUCHTEN,  President.  EVANSVILLE, IND.,  November 16, 1983.  Senator DAN QuAYLE,  Senate Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR SIR: This letter is being written with  reference  to the automobile  industry and  the Japanese imports into our country.  No doubt you are aware of the percentage  of Japanese cars sold in the United States  which is approximately 22 percent.  It is said that every Japanese car sold here  the  federal,  state and  local  taxes  loses  $1750.  Since 1981  the Japanese have kept  the  value of their yen low as compared to our  dollar, thus allowing more cars to be sold at  lower prices.  It is my understanding that one of our  cars sold in Japan is double what we pay for  it here in the U.S., while a Japanese car  sells for less here than in Tokyo.  The thousands of Japanese cars sold in  our  country  has  caused  unemployment  reaching into the 300,000 in our auto indus try.  There are some predictions that if no re strictions are put on their cars, that by 1987  they could  take 35  to 40 percent of our  market.  We Americans cannot ignore the fact that  we have vital industries like the automobile  that needs protecting. Our American gov ernment should not hesitate to use quotas  and other policies to restore fair competi tion.  Now, a little about myself:  I had worked in the automobile industry  almost all my life, working for Chrysler 37  years. The last 35 on management, moving  around and finally retiring at the St. Louis  car assembly plant in 1971.  My wife and I moved back to Evansville in  1975 to be near our grandchildren.  The past six years I have been Republican  precinct committeeman and certainly have  enjoyed it.  This information is not only being report ed for myself but many other retired Chrys ler workers whom I have talked with here in  Evansville. We are all so thankful for Mr.  Lee Iacocca's leadership of Chrysler but also  the U.S. Government and State who helped  the corporation financially when it looked  like they could not continue.  Our pensions, hospitalization and doctors  insurance was at stake.  What can you do to help our future auto mobile industry and also hold down unem ployment by getting our Government to es tablish a limit on Japanese cars entering our  country?  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  JAMES GRIFFITH .   ",1984
94,431,1,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, Edson  W. Spencer is chairman and chief ex ecutive officer of Honeywell Inc., one  of our country's largest defense suppli ers. In the December 23 Minneapolis  Star & Tribune, he published a paper  urging a zero tactical nuclear weapons  level.  Spencer's proposal  is  understand able, but not simplistic. It would not  disturb the standoff in strategic weap ons, but could set the stage for a build down process.  I  commend  the article, which  fol lows, to thoughtful students of nucle ar arms reductions.  TACTICAL ZERO  <By Edson W. Spencer>  The world today faces three grave risks,  any one of which could cause a nuclear acci dent, which could in turn lead to a major  war. The risk of such a war may be greater  than at any time since Hitler marched into  the Rhineland  in 1936. The potential for  cataclysmic damage is far greater.  One risk brought abruptly into focus was  signaled by the dangerous series of mistakes  apparently made by the Soviet air defense  in shooting down Korean Airlines Flight  007. The mistakes that led to the tragic loss  of a civilian aircraft suggest the possibility  of a series of mistakes leading to something  far worse.  A  second  risk  relates  to  proliferation  among nations of the capacity to manufac ture nuclear weapons-and to steal  them.  The dangers in the use of these weapons as  potential blackmail threats pose a risk for  all nations, including the two super powers.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  A third risk is due to uncertainties at the  top of Soviet civilian leadership, which cur rently appears weak and unsure of its direc tions. The military appears to be taking a  stronger role, and maneuvering for the next  succession  could  further weaken present  leaders. This in turn will probably prolong  the present period of high tension between  our country and the Soviet Union, making it  difficult to accomplish significant progress  to lessen the tension through negotiations.  The history of negotiations between our  two nations is not encouraging. As a result,  the risks inherent in nuclear confrontation  seem to be accelerating faster than our abil ity to negotiate safety nets that reduce the  chance of nuclear explosions.  To mitigate these risks, a creative new ini tiative is needed by our government, an ini tiative that would seek to achieve an imme diate set of objectives rather than gradually  negotiate toward such an end over a  long  period with very limited progress in elimi nating the risks. As a concerned citizen who  is also the chief executive of a major corpo ration <Honeywell Inc. with over $800 mil lion in defense contracts last year>. I feel  strongly that we must bring into play a new  approach and an even more heightened  sense of urgency. Here are some sugges tions:  First, we  should offer  to  remove  from  Europe all tactical nuclear weapons, includ ing missile warheads and munitions, and  return them to the United States.  Second, we should then offer immediate ly-with complete Soviet access for verifica tion-to destroy these and all other tactical  nuclear weapons in our arsenal as well as  seeing that those of our NATO allies are  also destroyed.  Third,  the  conditions  required  of  Soviet Union for our agreeing to do  would be:  The signing and ratification of a  treaty  between our country, our NATO allies and  the Soviet Union banning further develop ment or manufacture of  tactical nuclear  weapons:  Simultaneous with our elimination of tac tical nuclear weapons, the destruction of all  tactical nuclear weapons in the Soviet arse nal, with free access and verification by U.S.  and other NATO observers;  Acceptance by the Soviet Union of a joint  approach to some type of risk-reduction or  crisis-avoidance center so  that a mistake  may be prevented from becoming a cata clysm: and  Finally,  a U.S./U.S.S.R.-sponsored U.N.  agreement banning development and manu facture of tactical nuclear weapons by any  member country, with  the United States  and Soviet Union agreeing to enforce this  ban together.  This would  still  leave  the  two  super  powers at a  stand-off  in  intercontinental  strategic weapons, but with  the potential  for negotiating a build-down option on both  sides. Build-down to the level of a minimum  but still meaningful deterrent might take a  decade and, to zero, a lifetime.  If we and the Soviet Union can move in  the direction of significantly reducing the  number of nuclear weapons, our two coun tries should then enter into broad-ranging  discussions at various levels, both private sector and government,  in an attempt  to  define our  future  relationships  in other  areas. The objectives of our two countries,  our historical background and our mind sets  are very different. But we do have to coex ist, and to do so we need to have continuous  dialogue and a much deeper inderstanding  the  this  429  r  of each other's motivations, fears and con cerns.  Critics of this proposal may say it is im practical. It is  impractical  if one or both  super powers do not have the will to negoti ate, as that only prolongs  the bargaining  stalemate. It is not at all impractical if it  can bring both sides back to the table and  move the negotiations forward. It makes our  intention clear and could put the Soviet  Union on the spot, causing it to show the  world its intentions as well. The accomplish ment of ""tactical zero"" would be in the na tional self-interest of both nations. The pro posal in no way changes our nation's need  for a strong defense in conventional weapons.  Idealistic? Yes. Progress  is never made  without  ideals. Weapons reduction cannot  change the attitudes and fears that led to  their creation in the first place. But a suc cessful negotiation leading to a meaningful  reduction of  the nuclear  threat on both  sides may help, in turn, to modify those atti tudes and fears.  Such a position offers a better negotiating  posture than the Reagan ""zero option"" pro posal, which  provided  that  the United  States would not deploy and that the Sovi ets would  reduce  intermediate-range mis siles in and around Europe. Even if it were  accepted by the Soviet Union, this proposal  would have left a substantial nuclear arse nal in Europe on both sides. On the other  hand, if the proposal I am putting forward  for a ""tactical zero"" option could be negoti ated, it would eliminate the greatest area of  risk for accidentally, or through blackmail,  triggering a nuclear disaster. It would clear ly define where the free world wants to go  in armament reductions. It would provide  the present and  future Soviet  leadership  with an alternative to protracted negotia tions  that reduces numbers but not risk,  while relieving  its defense budget of sub stantial expeditures. It would have great  public appeal.  Most  important,  if  successful,  ""tactical  zero"" would move the world substantially in  the direction of becoming a safer place in  which to live.e  THE ERA/ABORTION  CONNECTION  HON.

96,444,1,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I regret  that another January has passed with  Anatoly Shcharansky still languishing  in  the  infamous  Soviet  Chistopol  Prison. On January 20, 1984, Anatoly,  in poor health, celebrated his 36th  birthday in a cold, dank prison cell,  without the support of his family or  friends or his dear wife, A vital.  In  the  Jewish  religion, Anatoly's  36th birthday, a ""double chai"" symbol izes a rededication to life-a birthday  to be remembered and cherished. Yet,  for Anatoly  this day  represents an other of the thousands of days of his 7  years  imprisonment  that he would  rather forget.  Arrested on trumped up charges of  treason, a kangaroo court found him  guilty and sentenced him to 13 ardu ous years in the Soviet penal system.  Anatoly's health has suffered consid erably, as he has repeatedly sustained  bouts of chest pains, severe headaches,  and blurred vision as a result of his ex treme  confinement. The Soviet  auEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  thorities, who  refuse him adequate  medical care, do not offer any expla nations when questioned.  Other deprivations that Anatoly has  been made to suffer include nondeliv ery of his mail and a prohibition of  visitors. The situation deteriorated so  badly last year that Anatoly began a  hunger  strike, which  lasted  several  months. Despite being force fed by his  Soviet prison guards, he  refused  to  yield until his  rights as a prisoner  were  reestablished. After much pro testing, Anatoly was allowed to receive  his mail and was allowed a visit by his  mother, Ida Milgram. Unfortunately,  these rights were once again unreason ably revoked not long ago, and Anato ly again engaged  in a 2-day hunger  strike to regain them. This time, the  Soviet Union acceded quickly, and the  flow of mail to Anatoly was once again  resumed. Not long ago, on January 5,  Anatoly was allowed a visit with his  mother,  Ida,  and  brother,  Leonid.  They reported Anatoly to be emaciat ed, with ailments that deprive him of  much needed rest. His captors have re fused Anatoly any  type of hospital  care, stating that such treatment was  only for ""extreme"" cases. Yet, through  all these trials and tribulations, Anato ly Shcharansky maintains his coura geous stand, and remains  the noble  symbol of man's struggle for freedom  and  human  dignity.  Though  his  health is fragile, his spirit is strong.  Sadly, this important birthday is one  of many that Anatoly has been forced  to spend in captivity. He has desired  nothing more over the years than to  be reunited with his wife, Avital,  in  Israel.  Anatoly  Shcharansky  has  spoken out time and again for so many  others. It is now incumbent upon us to  speak out for him-to urge the Soviet  Union  to  free  him  from  bondage.  While Anatoly slowly wastes away in  his dedication to human rights, let us  rededicate ourselves on the occasion of  his double-chai birthday, and work for  the  time when Anatoly  and many  other  dissidents will  no  longer  be  spending their birthdays in a Soviet  prison.e  THOUGHTS FOR 1984  HON.

JAMES J. FLORIO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 25, 1984   ",1984
98,444,1,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, allowing  suppliers to coerce retailers into sell ing at prices dictated by suppliers is  against the law and harms consumers.  Yet the antitrust enforcement agen cies have virtually abandoned prosecu tion of such cases. I am here inserting  in the REcoRD an article that well de scribes this controversy. As the article  notes, the current approach is at odds  with a longstanding bipartisan consen sus opposing resale price fixing. Tore iterate that consensus,  I have  intro duced H.J. Res. 389 and welcome addi tional cosponsors.  The article follows:  [From the Washington Post, Dec. 12, 19831  REAGAN'S PuSHING A PuBLIC RIP-OFF ON  PRICE FIXING  <By Jerry Knight>  Discount  store  shoppers who  bought  Ronald Reagan's campaign promises ought  to take a look at their ballots to see if they  came with a money-back guarantee.  Consumers have been bait-and-switched  by the president on an issue that could po tentially cost them millions of dollars and  dramatically change their shopping habits.  At a time when more and more people are  shopping  in discount stores and off-price  outlets, the Reagan administration is push ing proposals  that would  virtually  shut  down discounters by making it impossible  for them to cut prices without the permis sion of the maker of the goods.  Since the year Ronald Reagan was born, it  has been against the law in this country for  manufacturers to dictate prices: the big ex ception was ended in 1975 when Congress  repealed  the so-called ""Fair Trade  laws""  that prevented price cutting.  Liberals fought retail price fixing on the  grounds  that  it was  anticompetitive and  anti-consumer. Conservatives opposed  fair  trade as contrary to the free market. The  case against retail price maintenance was  argued vigorously at that time by a former  governor of California, a Great Communica tor who recalled a tale from his days as an  ""One of the old-time ventriloquist tricks  entertainer to make his point.  in vaudeville was done by the fellow who  would  sing a  chorus of  'Yankee Doodle  ",1984

The MSAW  system is not just some abstract cog in  the Nation's air traffic control system.  Last year, the system saved the lives  of passengers on an Argentine airliner  that came critically close to colliding  with the World Trade Center in New  York City.  NATIONAL SECURITY  The Department of Commerce, by  written agreement, shares information  available  through  the Aeronautical  Chart Division during times of nation al emergency. In other words, during  an emergency,  the Defense Depart ment's need for accurate and up-to date charts of the Nation's air traffic  lines becomes critical as resources are  mobilized  for  transport around  the  country. For this reason alone, the de cision  to  contract  the  aeronautical  charting function must not be consid ered ""business as usual"" in implement ing OMB Circular A-76. In my view,  the Congress would be remiss if it did  less than insist on the most rigorous  review of  this matter. The Congress  has  already  shown  rare wisdom  in  demonstrating similar concern in this  legislation for the proposed contract ing of our Nation's weather satellite  system.  LIABILITY  Both the Federal Tort Claims Act  and  the Admiralty Act  require  the  Government  to assume  full  liability  for information contained on its nauti cal charts.  I  should point out  that  NOAA's Nautical Chart Division  is  also under review for contract. There fore,  it is both possible, and in fact  probable,  that  the  contractor will  avoid liability. If such were to become  the case, I would find it hard to under stand how one could legitimately con duct an equitable comparison of the  costs of the contract. In my view, the  taxpayers' exposure to risk in a pri vately contracted venture would mark edly increase. A bad deal for the Gov ernment is a bad deal for the taxpay er.  Before leaving the Federal Aviation  Administration, its former Director, J.  Lynn Helms publicly stated his con cern about  the proposed contracting  of the Aeronautical Chart Division.

102,483,1,Mr. WALKER.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thought this afternoon we might want  to look a little bit at what has taken  place in this House this week. It has  been a  little bit different.  I  think,  expected  from what  some  people  might take place this week.  I do not believe  there were many  people who expected that some of the  substantive  issues  facing  the Nation  would get raised on the House floor  this week. And yet they did. I do not  believe that there were many people  who believed that we would deal with  some of the problems with the way  this  institution  governs  itself  this  week. But yet we did. There has been  a  record compiled this week which I  think will make at least a little bit of  difference in the weeks ahead. I would  like to review a little bit about what it  is that has happened.  A number of Members came to the  floor of the House of Representatives  on several days this week and suggest ed that this House ought to deal with  at least three basic issues: a balanced  budget. voluntary school prayer, and  line item veto. We went through a pro cedure, strictly within  the  rules. of  asking unanimous consent that those  bills be brought to the floor, not im mediately, but brought  to  the  floor  under a rule that would require open  debate of those issues. That particular  request in each and every instance was  turned down by the majority side.  What does that mean? It means very  simply that the majority party is un willing to have those issues discussed.  For years they have kept those issues  from coming out of committee and  onto the floor, and now, by taking the  route of  coming  to  the  floor  and  asking that they be brought here by  Members'  requests,  we  were  also  denied the opportunity to have that  done.  I  think  that  says  clearly  to  the  American  people  that  this House  really is not willing to deal with those  issues. that those are not issues that  this House  recognizes as  important.  even  though  in many of  those  in stances 80 percent of  the American  people think that they are important  and think this House should be deal ing with them.  In  the  case  of  voluntary  school  prayer,  it  is an  issue. as my distin guished colleague, the gentleman from  Minnesota,  has  pointed  out.  on  a  couple of occasions that has been in  this House for 21 years. It has been  here for 21 years and in that entire  period the American people have ex pressed over and over again. by a 75 to  80 percent majority in polls, that they  believe that is an issue that should be  dealt with. And yet this House in that  21-year period has not even considered  it. I do not care how Members vote. I  say, ""Vote any way you want on that  issue."" But at least I think we ought to  consider something that has that kind  of momentous  support  among  the  American people. We did not do it. We  asked to do it this week, and we were  turned down.  thank  ",1984

Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman  is making an important point that we  need  to emphasize and  reemphasize  and reemphasize in the course of this  year.  The point that I  think we need to  also underline is that the reason that  these  items are not brought  to  the  floor is not simply because in the view  of  the majority  there  is  too much  other pressing business. There  is a  large number of items brought to the  floor of this House for debate that are  on the agenda of the Democratic ma jority but which are put there frankly  for political reasons. In the course of  last year. we spent countless hours de bating a number of pieces of legisla tion which may have merit but which  we  all  knew were  never  going  to  become law but which were debated  because, in the legitimate view of the  majority, they deserved a full airing.  I point out that the nuclear freeze  issue probably falls in that category;  also the domestic content bill. That is  not to say that Members on the other  side of the aisle do not legitimately be lieve  those are  reasonable proposals  but only to say that we all knew they  were not going to become law, either  because they would not be enacted by  the Senate or would not be signed into  law by the President.  On those  items that are of impor tance to the Democratic majority, we  debate them. whether they are going  to become law or not, but on the sub stantial  items  the gentleman  in the  well  has  raised, which  have  over whelming support by  the American  people, we do not get a chance to even  talk about the issues.  I think I speak for a number of us  when I say that we are frustrated by  the continued use of the rules by the  majority  to  bring  their  political  agenda  to  the  floor  time and  time  again but to deny us the opportunity  to have our political agenda brought  to  the  floor,  particularly on  those  items where we have the support of  the American people.

He opened the Conference  on Atoms  for Peace  held  by  the  Georgetown University  Center  for  Strategic and International Studies on  December 7 and 8, 1983. In his address  my good  friend Stub Cole gave his  views on the subject of nuclear prolif eration. Fully accepting the fact that  his  views  reflect  his  personal  thoughts, I strongly commend them to  you since he is a person with a great  deal of experience  in atomic energy  development particularly as a member  and chairman of the first committee  of Congress exclusively responsible for  legislation  in  the  field  and as  the  former Director General of the Inter national Atomic Energy Agency. Ac cordingly,  I am happy to include at  the conclusion of these remarks Mr.  Sterling Cole's complete statement for  the information of all of the Members:  REMARKS OF HON.  STERLING CoLE AT  THE  OPENING OF THE CONFERENCE ON ATOMS FOR  PEACE: AFTER 30 Years  It is a signal honor for me to open this  conference  commemorating  the  thirtieth  anniversary of the great Atoms for Peace  address  to  the United Nations  in which  Dwight Eisenhower electrified  the world  with his call upon all nations to join togeth er not only in halting the build-up of nucle ar armaments but also in putting the atom  to work for human betterment by peaceful  uses of  the very  same nuclear material  which was used for war. Few,  if any, ad dresses have ever done so much to raise the  world's hopes for a future filled with prom ise rather than peril, and I am proud to  have been involved in the background which  brought it about.  You have asked me to share with you this  morning my thoughts on the subject of nu clear proliferation.  When we hear or see the word ""prolifera tion"", we of course think of the dangers to  peace that are created by horizontal prolif eration-that is, the addition of new nations  to the ranks of those already possessing nu clear arms-and also by vertical prolifera tion, that is, enlarging stockpiles of the na tions that already had nuclear weapons.  But to stop there would be a mistake. The  costs of proliferation must be measured in  terms of opportunities lost as well as dan gers created. Every dollar or ruble or other  unit of currency that is spent on nuclear  weaponry diminishes the resources that are  available  for  projects  promoting  benign  human purposes.  Nobody  has  ever perceived  the  conse quences of the proliferation problem more  clearly than did Dwight Eisenhower him self. As he put it in his historic speech: ""It is  not enough to take this weapon out of the  hands of the soldiers. We must put it in the  hands of those who will know how to strip  its military casing and adapt it to the arts of  peace.""  Toward this end, he invited the weapons  states to make joint contributions of fission able materials  to an international agency  that would be created under UN auspices  and that would be responsible for devising  methods of using the materials in construc tive ways.  ""A  special purpose"", he  said,  ""would be  to provide abundant electrical  energy  in  the power-starved areas of the  world.""  What do the ledger entries look like if we  now try to strike a  trial balance on where  the problem of proliferation stands three  decades after that speech?  On the good side, we have the Interna tional Atomic Energy Agency.  It has  a  highly competent staff which has served  the world extremely well, both in helping  protect against the bad in the atom and in  taking advantage of the good. Furthermore,  it has the good fortune to have a Director  General who has increasingly demonstrated  his high qualities as an effective leader.  The Non-Proliferation Treaty is another  major entry on the plus side of the ledger. I  fear we may take too much for granted both  in the extraordinary nature of the commit ments made by the Treaty's signers, and the  fact  that  there has never been a  single  known violation of  the  IAEA-NPT  safe guards system. We must, of course, regret  the ease with which a signatory may with draw from the Treaty at any time. Also it is  regrettable that many nations have so far  refrained from signing the NPT, and that  their ranks include several whose technical  capabilities are unquestionably equal to pro ducing nuclear weapons. Finally. we must  regret the considerations that caused some  nations to add their names to the list of  those that already possessed nuclear arms  at the time Dwight Eisenhower spoke; then  there were 3 and now  there are 9 which  have or can have them.  To date,  the accretions  to  the world's  weapons stockpiles that have resulted from  horizontal proliferation have been greatly  overshadowed by  the  immense growth  in  the number and destructive power of the  weapons in the arsenals of the nuclear su perpowers by vertical proltferation.  In connection with the problem of prolif eration, I must insert here a strong criticism  of the Nuclear Proliferation Act of 1978 in  which Congress created severe impediments  to American participation in international  trade in the fabrication of power reactors  which should be remedied at once by cre ation by the President of a blue ribbon com mission  to make recommendations so for eign countries may continue to benefit from  our competitive technology in the field of  peaceful uses.  With weapons  technology now at  the  point where the explosion of Just a single  warhead can lay waste to the largest Soviet  or American city, the strategic forces of the  two sides alone have between  them well  over 15,000 warheads. And when other than  strategic weapons are also  taken  into ac count, the combined inventories of the two  powers approximate 40,000 weapons.  American  policy  announcements  about  the circumstances under which we might  feel compelled to use atomic weapons have  varied over  time.  In  the years when we  alone possessed nuclear arms, and also  in  the subsequent years when our margin of  atomic superiority was overwhelming, we  made it unmistakably clear that we would  draw upon our atomic arsenals for help if  we  faced  threats  that could not be con tained through conventional means.  In  recent years, our declarations about  when we might be forced to turn to atomic  weaponry  for  our defense  have  become  more  ambiguous. One  element  in  these  policy pronouncements, however, has  re mained unchanged. We have never been  willing  to declare  that we would  refrain  from  using nuclear weapons  so  long  as  others refrained from using them, as the So viets have done.  Our refusal  to make such a no-first-use  pledge has related both to war deterrence  and war waging. We have feared that ruling  out the first use option would invite aggres sion. A foe  that thought it could prevail  against our side in a war fought solely with  conventional  forces,  we  have  reasoned,  would be more likely to strike if he thought  he could do so without inviting nuclear re taliation. We have  also  feared  that  the  strength of  the other side's conventional  forces might make it impossible for us to  contain  a  conventional  attack without  resort to nuclear arms.  Of late, our stand on nuclear weapons use  has been increasingly questioned. Would it  not be the case,  the questioners ask, that  any use of such weapons, however limited,  would almost inevitably lead to increasingly  devastating exchanges that could well esca late into a general nuclear war that brought  ruination to both sides? Might our national  interest therefore not be better served by  moving toward a second-use-only policy in  which we would pledge not to use nuclear  weapons unless another party used  them  first?  I presume that many of you have read  what is perhaps the best known summation  of the concerns of those  troubled by our  present day position on nuclear weapons  use. I refer to the article entitled ""Nuclear  Weapons and the Atlantic Alliance"" that ap peared in the Spring 1982 issue of Foreign  Affairs and which reflected the thinking of  four  distinguished Americans who  have  served  the Presidents of both parties  in  high national security posts.  Provided there is a political will to do so,  the authors believe, it is within the capacity  of the Atlantic Alliance to raise its conven tional forces to a level needed for the adop tion of a policy  in which our side would  pledge not to use  its nuclear weapons so  long as the other side did not use theirs.  And they see compelling arguments, both  political and military, and moving  toward  ",1984

114,509,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise to commend to the attention of  the Senate a book entitled Real Peace:  a Stategy  for  the West written by  former President Richard M. Nixon.  As a student of international policy  during his political career and as the  leading administrator of  foreign af fairs during his Presidency, Richard  Nixon is highly qualified to make a re sponsible statement concerning world  affairs. In this new book, former Presi dent Nixon has assembled a concise  and cogent plan for developing a last ing peace, and I am pleased that he  has recorded his ideas and that they  will receive the consideration they de serve.  The diametrically opposed philoso phies  of  the Governments  of  the  U.S.S.R. and  the United States are  generally considered  to be the most  apparent  and potentially  the most  volatile threat to global peace which  exists  in the world  today. Although  the differences and problems between  the two countries are extremely com plex, frustrating, and seemingly non negotiable,  President Nixon  asserts  that we are currently experiencing a  highly unique situation, as both the  Soviet Union and the United States  have a common interest of avoiding a  world war that neither country could  survive.  In the past few years,  the Soviet  Union has made significant advances  in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and  Latin America. It is estimated that the  U.S.S.R. has close to 125,000 military  personnel throughout the globe, pro tecting their newly acquired national  interest. However,  as  their holdings  expand  and  the  influence  of  the  U.S.S.R. grows stronger, so also does  the burden of financing their adven turism.  Nixon  purports  that  the  U.S.S.R. has clearly endangered their  economic stability in the recent past in  their attempt  to  isolate  the United  States. The  threat of overextension  has  prompted  the  leaders  of  the  U.S.S.R. to seriously reevaluate their  world  standing,  and Nixon believes  that now is the time to deal.  Probably  the most  insightful and  useful principle contained  in ""Real  Peace"" is Nixon's belief that the key  to attaining peace  is  to understand  and control the national  interer.t of  the U.S.S.R. It is certain that when  dealing with the leaders of the Com munist Party in Russia that they will  act, not necessarily according  to ac cepted ethical and moral standards,  but always in their own best interests.  It has been difficult for the United  States to deal effectively with the, at  best, amoral  foreign policies of  the  U.S.S.R., because we have an obliga tion and responsibility to combat their  policies with morally responsible deci",1984

116,522,1,Mr. GOLDWATER., Yes.  ,1984
117,522,1,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, I  will announce for the information of  Senators who were not here earlier  that there will be a vote on the motion  to table the motion to proceed about 3  o'clock, give or take 5 minutes. That  will be a rollcall vote.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  ",1984
118,548,1,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I rise in  opposition to the motion to table con sideration of S. 1660,  the Universal  Telephone Service Preservation Act. I  do so because I believe it is time for  Congress to accept responsibility for  setting telecommunications policy.  For the past 20 years, Congress has  stood on the sidelines while telecom munications policy was  set by  the  courts,  the Justice Department, and  the FCC. We stood and watched when  competition was  injected  into  the  system,  although  it was  clear  that  such action would have serious conse quences. We  stood and watched as  technology advanced at a rate far too  rapid  to be  accommodated  by  the  guidelines set in the 1934 Communica tions Act. We stood and watched as  the world's best  telephone company  was broken apart, with no one provid ing a clear understanding of how the  transition would be managed.  Do not misunderstand me. I am not  here to speak against competition or  technological  advancement,  or  to  argue that we should try to put the  Bell System back together. All I am  saying is that throughout this period as decisions were made that affected  jobs, trade, and the future of universal  service-Congress stood silent.  Today we are paying the price for  our silence. Decisions made by those  outside this body over the past two  decades are coming together, seeming ly all at once, in a way that has placed  tremendous upward pressure on local  telephone rates. Some of this pressure  is real, some is rhetoric. Much of it  could be eliminated if Congress would  speak with a clear voice and would lay  out some guidelines for the FCC and  state regulatory bodies to follow.  In  the  absence  of  congressional  action, these decisions will be left to  the FCC. Unfortunately, the FCC has  demonstrated an  inability  to send a  clear signal on these  issues, when a  clear signal  is sorely needed. Let us  look at the record:  July, 1983: on  the eve of Joint House Senate hearings in the access charge deci sion, the FCC voted to reduce the first-year  charges and to extend the transition period.  October, 1983: just prior to consideration  of H.R. 4102,  the FCC voted  to suspend  access charges until April, 1984.  December, 1983: the FCC issued a study  that attempted  to minimize  the  role of  access  charges and other FCC-mandated  changes in the escalating local rates.  Yesterday, the FCC tentatively decided to  extend  its  own moratorium  on  access  charges until after the 1984 elections.  The FCC's on-again off-again record  of the past year has not removed un certainty; it has compounded it.  I believe the time has come for Con gress to assume its responsibility for  setting  telecommunications  policy.  Without legislation,  there  is no cer tainty for the consumer that universal  service will be preserved. Without leg islation, State regulatory bodies will  be unable to accurately evaluate rate  requests. Without  legislation,  tele phone companies will be unable to ac curately  determine  their  legitimate  capital and operating costs. Like other  businesses, telephone companies need  to remain financially viable, and their  employees need  to have  their hard  earned pension rights protected.  In fact, if we fail to act today, only  one thing is certain: the 99th Congress  will be guaranteed its No. 1 domestic  issue-telecommunications.  A  con sumer revolt over dramatically higher  and more complicated telephone bills  will force its consideration. We will be  forced to plow the same furrow, but a  lot deeper next time.  ",1984

If it came out in that manner, I  apologize publicly.  Mr. GARN addressed the Chair.  ",1984
128,561,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Utah is recognized.  ,1984
129,561,1,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, the Sena tor from Utah also detected it as per sonal.  I will give  the Senator from  Ohio the benefit of the doubt that he  did not mean it that way. But when we  start  talking about courage on  this  floor, the Senator from Ohio is enti tled to his opinions and is given the  right  to express  them. Certainly he  has exercised that right on this floor  over and over again on small  items,  holding up  this  body  interminably  over issues that put this body to tough  votes. That is his right. And it is the  right of the Senator from Oklahoma  to bring up his amendments.  But I am getting a little bit tired of  the demagoguery that goes on on this  floor. And I am not referring to the  Senator from Ohio. I am referring in  general  to the demagoguery on this  floor over these issues of pay.  The Senator from Ohio referred to  me about honorariums and, boy, is he  right. I have stood on this floor and  defended  the right of Senators and  Congressmen  to  earn  legal  income  that is fully disclosed to their constitu ents.  The Senator from Ohio said that if  the Senator from Oklahoma did not  want to take the money, he did not  have to. And that is the same issue on  legally earned outside income. The key  is ""fully disclosed."" Senators in this  body, as I expressed last year to the  late Senator Jackson,  if they do not  like honorariums, if they think there  is something wrong with them, they  do not have to impose that judgment  on the rest of this body. They simply  have to say, ""I don't take them.""  That  is  the  amazing  thing,  the  number of Senators in this body who  last fall voted to reestablish an hono rarium cap and yet they  took them  even after they talked about how evil  they are. What kind of demagoguery is  that, to accept honoraria but then, for  political purposes,  to stand out here  and criticize them?  I am going to repeat what I have  said before, and I think it is the key  point on that particular issue. It is dis closure.  I went through a campaign in 1980  where my opponent could not  find  much else to talk about so he talked  about my outside earned income. He  did not refer to it as honoraria. He re ferred to it as corporate tips-corpo rate tips. Great. That is a good phrase  the Senator from Ohio could use. Cor porate  tips.  He  knows  something  about the corporate world, I do not. I  was not  in business.  I do not have  wealth. I do not have an inheritance. I  do not have a rich wife. I have seven  kids, three of them in college and No.  4 will be in college next September.  But I went through a whole cam paign, and my opponent even had TV  ads, black and white so  they looked  sinister. A bald-headed guy holding  out his hand, kind of in the dark, sort  of resembled me, and talked about my  ""corporate  tips."" My  response was  they are fully disclosed in great detail.  My  constituents know where  every  dollar came from on what date and  from where.  Even so, I received 74 percent of the  vote. I guess the other 26 percent did  not vote for me because I took outside  earned income.  But another key point is the dispari ty  between  earned  and  unearned  income. I will guarantee you that this  body, sometime during this year, will  face this issue again as they did last  fall. If there is a limit on legally, fully  disclosed outside earned  income, we  are going to have a limit on unearned  income. Nobody  can  stand on  this  floor and convince me  that $2,000,  fully disclosed to your constituents, is  influencing  legislation.  And  yet  wealthy Senators can  take $50,000,  $100,000, a half-million dollars, a mil lion dollars in dividends and interest  and shares in their businesses without  it even being  fully disclosed  as  to  where it comes from or the amount,  but in broad categories. Yet it is sug gested  that Senators can have un earned incomes between a half-million  dollars and a million and a half dollars  and that does not influence them, has  no  impact whatsoever on their deci sions  in  this body, but a couple of  thousand dollars, fully disclosed, does.  Baloney. If this were not the floor of  the Senate, I would use another word  that starts with a B but would not be  acceptable.  I  think everybody knows  what  I am  talking about. The first  part of the word is ""Bull,"" and I will  leave off the last part.  So we will see about rich boys versus  poor boys  in  this body and sneaky  $2,500 picayunish pay  raises  in  the  middle of a recess. I would think the  Senator from Ohio would  really be  upset about that, as I have listened to  him with respect, and I mean that sin cerely. I might not agree, but I respect  him. I cannot imagine you condoning  it going into effect without a vote in  the middle of a recess.  But, at the very least, this body is  going to face votes on full disclosure if  we cannot place some kind of a  limit  so that earned and unearned income,  the rich and  the poor Senators are  treated the same whatever the rules  are, either no limits or some limits or  disclosure or no disclosure, except I  would not  favor no disclosure. Our  constituents are entitled to see that.  But there are going to be lots of votes  in this body about the wealthy Mem bers of this body disclosing every dime  and source of their income, where it  came from, on what date, so that their  constituents can judge whether they  are influenced or not.  That is the key-disclosure. Anytime  anybody wants  to  talk about  these  issues of pay, I am certainly willing.  But we are not going to continue to  put up with double standards in this  body. We have a cap now of $20,800.  That is $4,200 less than it was shortly  after I got here 9 years ago.  Well, if that is fair, let us put a cap  on unearned income, as well. Other wise, this will tum into a body of 100  Senators who  have  great wealth,  either from their work before they got  here, inheritance, a rich wife, of what ever. But we will not know what the  sources of it are, except in these big,  broad categories.  I do not understand the distinction.  I  really cannot comprehend the dis tinction between 2,000 bucks that is  fully disclosed and everybody knows  about it and you have to face your  constituents, but if you get those old  dividend coupons, you can clip them.  It does not matter how many there  are, it does not matter whether it is a  half million  bucks,  somehow  that  money is pure.  You  could  not  influence  the  wealthy, I suppose. Just those who go  out and fully disclose what is going on.  There is one other matter that was  brought up and that is  the issue of  Western water projects. Boy, if that is  not one to whip all the time. Boy, is  that not popular and great. Just come  out here and talk about big oil, big  banks  and Western water projects.  Boy, that covers it all. It makes every body heroes.  Well, I wish the Senator from Ohio  would come out and see what hap",1984
130,574,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  this afternoon a number of us leaving  a Democratic Caucus in the LBJ room  learned that members of the press are  evidently to be forbidden access to the  hallway that leads from the top of the  Senate steps to the Senate Chamber.  This presumably is a measure being  taken, or being contemplated, as part  of the general tightening up of access  to various parts of the Capitol followIn  ing the detonation of a bomb outside  the Senate Chamber on the night of  November 7, 1983.  I am sure this is being done, or is  being planned with the best of inten tions, but  I would  suggest  to  the  Senate that it is the very worst of re sponses.  The subject of terrorism is one that  is much on our minds at this moment;  possibly,  perhaps  likely  to  become  even more so as the decade progresses.  It is all the more important, then, that  we should think clearly about it.  I do not present myself as someone  with any greater knowledge of  the  subject than the next person, but it  may be that having served in several  ambassadorial posts, and for 7 years  now, on the Select Committee on In telligence, I have been somewhat more  involved with  the matter.  any  event, I have written and spoken on  the subject on a number of occasions  of late.  My small thesis has been as follows.  Generally  speaking,  there  are  two  kinds of terrorism, one new, one old.  The new form of terrorism may be  called State-sponsored terrorism. It is  the kind we associate with the present  regime in Iran; it was almost certainly  involved in the bombing of our Embas sy and our Battalion Landing Team  billet in Beirut. As Clausewitz said of  war, it is merely an extension of diplo macy.  Congress,  by  legislation,  has  ac knowledged this phenomenon, and our  present statutes provide for the desig nation of states  involved with state  terrorism.  An older form of terrorism, more or  less a century old both here and in  Europe, is a form of violence directed  not by a  state but against a  state,  having as its object the overthrow or  transformation  of  the  regime  in  power.  I assume this was the nature of the  recent Senate bombing.  It was  the  nature of the bombing of the U.S. Mis sion to the United Nations when I was  Permanent Representative in 1975. It  is almost a daily occurrence  in  the  world.  If the object of this form of terror ism is understood, the response follows  logically.  The object is to change the constitu tional order of government,  in  the  large sense of the term. The response  should be to see that, no matter what,  this is not allowed to happen.  No nation has shown  this under standing with  greater  courage  or  greater success  in recent years than  that of Italy. The object of the Red  Brigades was to bring about a massive  repression that would kill the Italian  democracy. At great cost, but with per fect firmness, the people and the government of Italy declined.  So must we decline.  I believe I was the first Senator to  visit the Capitol after the November 9  bombing. It was election day, and I  was taking an early flight to New York  to vote and then return to the day's  session. On the way to the airport, I  stopped at the Capitol to inspect the  damage. Coming down the steps there after I was asked over by a group of  journalists who had not yet been al lowed inside the building. I described  what I had seen. I was asked what I  thought.  I  answered  simply:  ""They  can bomb the Capitol, but they cannot  bomb the democracy.""  Surely I was not wrong. But I would  be if as a result of that event we sud denly  restricted  the  free  informal  movement of members of the press in  the various hallways and lobbies that  surround the Senate Chamber. Not for  nothing were  the members of  the  Press Gallery in the House of Com mons once referred to as the Fourth  Estate. A constitutional status if ever  there was one.  To cut off access-free, spontaneous,  adventitious, and often calamitous between Senators and the accredited  members of the Press Gallery would  be to change our institution. It would  begin to cut us off from the people  who send us here. The only possible  advantage would accrue to the lobby ists who are sent here-well, not exact ly by the people.  May I ask that we reconsider this  matter and make no changes whatever  where  the press  is concerned. That  would give victory to our common, if  secret enemies, enemies, that is, of our  democracy.

131,626,1,Mr. HUDDLESTON.," Mr. President,  I am pleased to report that the nation al commodity processing program es tablished by the Department of Agri culture on June 17, 1983, is being fa vorably receiv.ed by the private sector  and beginning to work in the manner  envisioned by Congress. During  the  first 6 months of the program, 46 na tional food companies applied for par ticipation.  Thirty-seven  companies  have been approved by  the Depart ment of Agriculture, nine applications  are pending, and only one company  has had its application denied.  The national commodity processing  program allows the Food and Nutri tion Service to ship USDA processed  and cheddar cheese, butter, nonfat dry  milk, rice, and honey directly to com mercial food processors for use in the  manufacture of processed foods. These  foods then are sold to eligible schools  and charitable  institutions at  lower  prices than reflect the value of the do nated commodities contained in them.  Mr. President,  I believe  that Con gress can, on balance, be pleased with  the  national  commodity  processing  program and the administration of the  program  by  the Department. The  Food and Nutrition Service  is  to be  commended for the effort it has made  in getting  a  new program off  the  ground. Food processors are partici pating, commodities are being moved  out of Federal storage, and recipient  agencies,  including school lunch pro grams throughout the country, have  an additional option on how to benefit  from U.S. agricultural surpluses.  In my judgment, however, it might  be possible to increase the amount of  dairy products being donated under  the national program if the Depart ment addressed  two  important ques tions.  The first question relates to the du ration of the program. Section 203 of  Public Law 98-8, which established the  commodity  processing  program,  re quires the Department to encourage  consumption of ""bonus"" agricultural  commodities, whenever they are made  available, through national commodity  processing agreements. Nevertheless,  when the Department issued its regu lations,  it interpreted section 203 of  Public Law 98-8 as ""encouraging proc essing agreements""  rather  than en couraging consumption on a perma nent basis ""whenever a commodity is  made  available without  charge  or  credit."" As a result, the program was  initiated  for only  a  limited period.  This has minimized the attractiveness  of the program to potential participat ing companies. I also recognize that  Congress, in extending section 203 of  Public Law 98-8-and other provisions  of  the Temporary Emergency Farm  Assistance Act of 1983-in Public Law  98-92, provided that section 203 would  terminate on September 30, 1985. The  Department, however, has authority  under other provisions of law to oper ate a national commodity processing  program on a permanent basis.

132,639,1,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Speaker, on  November 17  last year, I  joined with  Representatives  JIM MoAKLEY,  JoEL  PRITCHARD, BARNEY FRANK, TED WEISS,  JIM  JEFFORDS, ED TOWNS, and MIKE  LoWRY to introduce needed legislation  delaying the deportation of Salvador an nationals  residing  in  the United  States. Citizens  in El Salvador, par ticularly displaced persons,  are  the  first to be victims of violence. That vi olence comes not only from the ""death  squads,"" but  from a general break down of law and order: Essential serv ices  are not  available,  the  judicial  system  is nonexistent,  and  citizens  who become victims of the civil strife  637  have no safe haven to which they can  run.  Despite documented evidence of the  dangers in E1 Salvador, the Reagan ad ministration maintains a policy of de porting  Salvadoran  nationals  who  have  sought  refuge  in  the United  States. The Salvadorans who have fled  to this country fear the generalized vi olence inherent in civil war. They do  not ask for a new home here;  they  need temporary protection.  Staying deportation until Congress  determines that conditions in El Salva dor have reached a point that allows  the safe return of its citizens is a rea sonable approach to a dire problem.  All other North and Central American  countries now refrain from forcibly re turning  Salvadorans.  The  United  States should follow suit.  I would like to call to my colleagues'  attention an editorial from the New  York Times  in  support of  such  a  policy:  WHY POLES BUT NOT SALVADORANS?  talk  This is a story about a case of bureaucrat ic doubletalk, which  is harmless,  and a  double standard, which is not. The double is  ""extended  voluntary  departure,""  which means giving visitors to this country  a port in a sudden storm. The double stand ard  is  that the United States gives such  refuge to people from most of the world,  but not to people from El Salvador. Why  not?  There are refugees and there are refugees.  Some come here precisely to find a perma nent haven from persecution-Jews fleeing  Hilter in the 30's, boat people fleeing Viet nam in the 70's. But others come here as  visitors and are turned into refugees, while  here, by events at home. To force them to  return before the turmoil ends might be a  death sentence.  The Ugandans,  for example, who were  here  during  Idi  Amin's  bloody  last  days . . . or the Iranian students in colleges  across  the country when  the Ayatollah  came to power . . . or the Poles visiting in  this country when martial law was declared  in theirs ... or, now, the Salvadorans.  Some societies provide for temporary safe  haven by law. American law makes no such  provision but this country has evolved an in formal one, under the Attorney General's  prosecutory discretion: extended voluntary  departure. That means if you are in a class  of people found to need temporary haven in  an emergency, you can stay. Even if your  visa expires tomorrow morning, you have an  extra six months, say, to wait out the storm  back home, maybe longer.  For instance, if you are a Pole who was  caught here when martial law was declared  in your homeland in December 1981, your  extended voluntary departure deadline  is  about to be extended yet again, to Decem ber 1983. Over the years, the Government  has granted this kind of haven to other na tionalities,  too-Cubans, Czechs, Chileans,  Ethiopians, Nicaraguans, Ugandans and Af.  ghans. Why does this Administration refuse  to grant such safe haven to Salvadorans?  One explanation concerns danger. State  Department officials contend that the vio lence in El Salvador is not sufficiently in tense or widespread to justify extended vol untary departure. It's a puzzling argument,  coming just at the time the Administration  ",1984
133,652,1,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker, after  18 months of exhaustive study,  the  Presidential Commission  on Drunk  Driving has issued its final report-the  product  of  100  hours  of  hearings  across the country at which medical  experts,  law  enforcement  officials,  safety  authorities,  and  victims  of  drunk driving accidents testified about  the tragedy of drunk driving.  One of the Commission's key recom mendations: States should immediate ly adopt 21  years as  the minimum  legal purchasing and public possession  age for all alcoholic beverages.  In the last two Congresses, I have  sponsored a concurrent resolution ad vocating just this point. House Con current Resolution 23, which currently  has 83  cosponsors,  simply expresses  the sense of  the Congress  that all  States and the District of Columbia  should raise  the minimum legal age  for drinking and purchasing all alco holic beverages to 21.  House Concurrent Resolution 23  is  endorsed  by  the Departments  of  Transportation  and  Health  and  Human Services,  the Office of Man agement  and Budget,  the National  Transportation Safety Board and the  National Safety Council. It is support ed by Mothers Against Drunk Drivers  <MADD>. the American Medical Asso ciation <AMA>. the American Automo bile Association <AAA>.  the Interna tional Chiefs of Police, and numerous  health and insurance organizations.  This approach does not: establish a  Federal drinking  law, deny highway  funds to States which do not comply,  or provide incentive grants to States  which adopt 21.  It encourages  this  debate  to  take  place  in  individual  State legislative chambers, since tradi tionally the States have had jurisdic tion in the regulation of the sale and  distribution of alcohol.  Once again, I am asking for the sup port of my colleagues in the House in  what I consider to be the first step  Congress should take in establishing  21  as  the nationwide  legal age  for  drinking.  Thank you.e  TRIBUTE TO MR. TOM  McCARTHY  HON. GUS YATRON  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 26, 1984  e ",1984
134,652,1,Mr. YATRON.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to pay special tribute to Mr. Tom  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  McCarthy who recently attended the  World Cup Gymnastic Competition as  a coach of the U.S. national team.  Mr. McCarthy is the head coach of  the Berks Gymnastic Academy  in  Wyomissing,  Pa. He  has  coached  State,  national  and  international  champions  including Michelle Good win, Gina Stallone, and Cheryl Weath erstone,  the  national  champion  of  Great Britain. He has also coached the  Pennsylvania team in interstate com petition and coached in Tokyo, Japan,  representing the United States.  The Berks Gymnastic Academy has  ranked in the top four teams for sever al years and currently is ranked third  in the Nation. Much of this success is  due to the talents of Tom McCarthy.  I know that my colleagues will join  me in paying tribute to Mr. McCarthy.  He has contributed  tirelessly  to his  profession, his community, his State  and his Nation. His  special  talents  have greatly enhanced American gym nastics and he is clearly deserving of  national and international recognition.  I want to wish him continued success  in the future.e  BANKERS MUST HELP  IN ALLE VIATING THE DEBT BURDEN  HON.DOUGLASK.BEREUTER  OF NEBRASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 26, 1984  e ",1984
135,652,1,Mr.  BEREUTER.," Mr.  Speaker,  many in this country refuse to focus  their attention  to a  dangerous and  growing problem. While this country  awakens  from  a profound economic  slumber, developing nations continue  to struggle against high fuel prices,  spiraling  inflation, depressed export  markets, and unemployment.  Invest ment projects are heaping ruins of un finished construction, food stores are  being  looted and  the  small middle  class  is quickly disappearing. Mean while, conversion from military dicta torship  to a  true democracy will be  forced to pay over 10 percent of GNP  in debt repayments this year.  American commercial banks have re fused to accept a share of the burden  of a  longstanding problem which  is  partly of their making. Banks are in sisting on extremely high rates of in terest, which although quite profita ble,  create  enormous  pressures  on  Latin American governments. A Wash ington Post editorial of  last month  points out that Brazil is forced to pay  about 14.5 percent interest on its re scheduled loans. Our inflation rate is  now 3.4 percent yearly, making  the  real <nominal interest rate minus in flation> interest rate charged by banks  to Brazil about 10.7 percent. This is  far above a traditionally good rate of  return.  The editorial points out that when a  domestic company gets  into trouble,  January 26, 1981,.  bankers usually lower interest rates to  help  the  company  through  the  squeeze. That might squeeze immedi ate profits somewhat, but  it makes  good economic sense. Why,  then, do  not the banks apply the same ration ale  to  their beleaguered  customers  abroad? It would serve their own long term interests, as well as those of this  country and all other countries hoping  to grow and prosper in a healthy inter national economic environment. May  I, Mr. Speaker, commend this article  to my esteemed colleagues?  The article follows:  AMERICAN BANKS, LATIN DEBTS  In their  lending  to Latin America,  the  American commercial banks have not dem onstrated any great degree of either caution  or foresight. First they lent far more than  they intended. Now they are insisting on ex tremely high interest rates on those loans.  The present  level of  interest  is highly  profitable for the banks as long as it is paid.  But it is creating gigantic pressures in Latin  America  for moratoriums  and unilateral  action by Latin governments-action that  would disrupt not only the world economy  in general but the stability of the interna tional banking system itself.  The crucial case is Brazil, which currently  owes more than $90 billion. Of that, about  $63 billion  is  financed at  floating  rates.  Those rates are generally  two percentage  points above either the London interbank  rate, now about 10.5 percent a year, or the  New York prime rate, which is 11 percent.  That brings the average close to 13 percent  a year.  That's a swinging rate for debt that is de moninated in U.S. dollars, in which inflation  is now running about 5 percent a year. It  means that the real interest rate-the nomi nal rate minus inflation-is in the vicinity of  8 percent. That's four times the traditional  return on this kind of loan. In addition, the  banks have been charging a point and a half  in fees on each rescheduling. On the sub stantial part of the Brazilian debt that has  been rescheduled this year, that brings in terest currently to about 14.5 percent. The  Brazilians have fallen behind in payments.  Is that surprising?  One expert witness, Arthur Burns,  the  former chairman of  the Federal Reserve  and now American ambassador to Germany,  touched on the subject recently in talking  with reporters at the American Enterprise  Institute. Mr. Burns  observed  that  the  banks are not treating foreign governments  as they do domestic borrowers. When a do mestic company gets into trouble, its bank ers usually lower rates to see it through the  squeeze. They reason that it makes good  economic sense to sacrifice some interest in  order to save a customer. Mr. Burns won dered why the banks don't apply the same  logic to their customers abroad.  Some of the big banks argue that they  have to keep rates high so the smaller banks  will continue  to participate  in the loans.  That's open  to question. Some American  bankers also note that many of the loans to  Latin America come  from European and  Japanese banks. That's true, but irrelevant.  Any  leadership  is going  to have  to come  from the Americans.  Lower rates mean lower risks. Instead, the  opposite direction. Perhaps statesmanship is  bankers seem to be pressing blindly in the  too much to ask. But the great American  ",1984

It would be my hope  that we  might be able to obtain a unanimous consent agreement, which I have not  yet cleared on my side but which we  are going to work on, which would pro vide that we will  take up  the crime  package  today and  that no amend ments dealing with  capital punish ment,  the exclusionary  rule, habeas  corpus, or the Federal Torts Claim Act  would be eligible, in exchange for the  assurance, which I have already given  and now repeat, that after we dispose  of the comprehensive crime package it  is the intention of the leadership on  this side to ask the Senate to turn to  those four items, one at a time.  As I say, Mr. President, I have not  yet asked the Cloak Room on this side  to try to clear that agreement, but I  will do so now. I hope we can complete  that before it is time to turn to the  consideration of the crime package. I  have described  this at some  length  now so that Members who may hear  me in their offices may be aware of it.  The hotline will issue from our office  shortly, and I hope that we can have a  reply by 12:30.

148,704,1,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  the events surrounding  the publica tion of a court opinion  issued by a  Federal district judge in Denver, Colo.,  has been the subject of a number of  recent news accounts and editorials.  Briefly,  the  Justice  Department  sought and received a  temporary re straining order blocking publication of  an opinion rendered by Federal Dis trict Court Judge Winner. The fact  that  the Justice Department would  seek, and another Federal court would  grant such an order  is  remarkable.  But, the temporary restraining order  has not been revoked and the opinion  will be published in the near future.  However, in all this flap over the at tempt to block publication, we should  not  lose  sight of  the  larger  issues  raised by Judge Winner. In essence, he  is blowing the whistle on questionable  conduct of government prosecutors.  After reading Judge Winner's decision,  my first reaction was to call for hear ings  to shed additional light on the  issues raised in his opinion. I under stand that both the Federal district  court and the  lOth Circuit Court of  Appeals have different aspects of this  case under review. With that in mind,  the proper course may be to wait for  the  findings  from  these  hearings  before we begin our examination of  this matter and determine what action  Congress should take to insure protec tion against government misconduct.  In the meantime, I comment to my  colleagues  the following articles and  other accounts of this important issue:  [From the Denver Post, Jan. 27, 19841  JusTICE DEPARTMENT TRIES To GAG JUDGE  WINNER  <By William R. Ritz>  The U.S. Department of Justice, in a move  angrily derided as ""blatant  federal  arro gance"" and ""unshirted censorship,""  is at tempting to stop publication of an opinion  by a Denver federal court judge in which he  accuses three federal prosecutors of miscon duct.  The Justice Department's request for a  temporary restraining order quietly was ap proved by the lOth U.S. Circuit Court of Ap peals earlier  this month. The order bars  West Publishing Co. of St. Paul, Minn.,  from printing a decision by U.S. District  Judge Fred Winner in the Federal Supple ment, a hard-bound compilation of federal court decisions.  A  decision  by  the  appellate  court on  whether to make the order permanent could  come as early as this week.  But the decree could be anti-climactic be cause, whatever the outcome, the battle pit ting lawyers and civil  libertarians against  the Justice Department and appellate court  already will have been going strong.  At issue are three important constitution al points, say opponents of the restraining  order: prior restraint of the publisher, cen sorship of a federal judge, and the separa tion of branches of the government.  ""We're talking about a First Amendment  right of a judge to publish his opinion and  the Department of Justice  trying  to sup press that right, which we believe to be ab solute,"" said Richard Ruiner, one of the at torneys in tbe case.  ""Then you have a  separation-of-powers  problem with the executive branch trying to  ride herd over the judicial branch and pre vent  it  from  carrying  out  the  judicial  branch's rights and responsibilities.  ""It's astounding,"" he said.  ""When the indictment came down in 1982,  the Department of Justice  issued a  four page press release without worrying about  the reputations of the accused before they  had their day in court. Now, suddenly, they  are extremely worried about the reputations  of their attorneys . . . claiming they have  not had their day in court.  ""What's good for the goose is good for the  gander,"" he said.  <Glenn L. Archer Jr., the head of the Jus tice Department's tax division, said in an  interview with The New York Times that  the prior restraint on publication was neces sary because the ""slanderous"" judicial opin ion unfairly criticized three of his prosecu tors.  <Lawyers  involved in the case and other  legal experts said they knew of no previous  instance in which a private publisher had  been barred, on pain of contempt of court,  from publishing a judicial opinion.)  ""THIS IS A GAG ORDER""  If the restraining order is upheld, legal of ficials told The Denver Post, it could have a  chilling  effect  on  the  independence  of  American judges.  ""This is a gag order, pure and simple. It's  blatant federal arrogance,"" snapped lawyer  Donald E. Van Koughnet of Naples, Fla.,  ",1984
149,743,1,Mr.  HAMMERSCHMIDT.,"  Mr.  Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the very  able chairman of  the Subcommittee  on Hospitals and Health Care,  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  <Mr.  EDGAR).  ",1984
150,743,1,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker,  as an  original cosponsor of H.R. 1961,  the  Agent Orange and Atomic Veterans  Relief Act, I rise in full support of the  legislation.  As chairman of the House Veterans'  Affairs  Subcommittee  on Hospitals  and Health Care and a member of the  committee since 1975, I can attest to  the  fact  that  the subject of agent  orange has been one of the most seri ous and persistent problems we have  faced.  In 1978, our colleague,  the gentle man from California, DON EDWARDS,  and I were the first members of the  committee to call for hearings on the  issue of agent orange.  We have, since that time, held at  least nine hearings reviewing scientific  data, and the concerns of veterans and  their families in attempting to reach a  consensus on the issue.  Where the scientific community was  uncertain as to the range of disabil ities which could be attributed to ex posure  to agent orange  in humans,  there was general agreement on three  basic points:  Dioxin  is one of  the most highly  toxic substances known to man.  Second, during a 10-year period from  1961 to 1971 approximately 52 million  pints of the herbicide were sprayed in  South Vietnam.  Third, there was a growing concern  among  the Vietnam veteran popula tion that not only their health, but  the welfare of their families had been  adversely affected by exposure.  The VA has conducted over 130,000  agent orange health screening exami nations.  Nearly 11,000 Vietnam veterans  in  my own State of Pennsylvania have  gone to the Veterans' Administration  for  examinations and agent orange  counseling.  During the 97th Congress the Con gress  approved our  legislation, now  law, Public Law 97-72 which provides  health care in VA medical facilities for  veterans who have disabilities which  could be associated with exposure to  agent orange and ionizing radiation.  Based on far less evidence than this,  last year, the present administration  awarded $33 million  to relocate  the  families of Times Beach, Mo., who  only may have been exposed to dioxin  in the soil around their homes.  On these precedents and further sci entific evidence it only seems appro priate that we move forward at this  point with the presumptions for com pensation for three specific diseases:  Chloracne-a  skin  condition,  por phyria cutanea tarda-a liver disorder,  and soft tissue sarcomas.  In the same vein, our committee has  attempted to deal with the residual ef fects of exposure to ionizing radiation  among the ""Atomic Veteran"" popula tion. Between 1945 and 1963 the U.S.  Government exploded approximately  235 atmospheric nuclear devices. Ap proximately 200,000 American service  personnel were exposed to ionizing ra diation during that time, or during the  clean-up operations in Hiroshima and  Nagasaki. Again, as with  the agent  orange question, there has been dis agreement in the scientific community  as to the exact disabilities brought on  by varying degrees of radiation. But  still, the existing evidence was strong  enough to warrant, at a minimum at  this time, a presumption of disability  for three specific diseases: Cancer of  the  thyroid,  polycythemia  vera-a  bone disease, and  leukemia  if  those  disabilities appear within 20 years of  exposure.  Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that we  have taken an important first step in  bringing this bill to the floor. It does  not go as far as the bill we originally  introduced nor does  it include addi tional means of requiring that the VA  submit  additional  disabilities which  could be compensable as a result of ex posure to these environmental hazards  that was contained in an amendment  before the committee. There are many  of us on the committee who are also  concerned that the presumptive peri ods called for, for both Vietnam veter ans and atomic veterans, are unreal istically short. Still, the bill is a begin ning, and the House, at least, is taking  this important first step in behalf of  those who have served their country  and now seek our help.  I would like to express my deep ap preciation  to  the  gentleman  from  South Dakota, the original author of  this legislation, TOM DASCHLE for his  persistence and his dedication to this  issue.  I would also like to thank the leader ship  of  the  committee, Chairman  MONTGOMERY,  and Ranking Minority  Member JOHN PAUL HAMMERSCHMIDT  for their leadership and willingness to  compromise to seek this solution.

152,743,1,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, today we  are considering  legislation  that will  provide a measure of relief that is long  overdue for the thousands of veterans  suffering from illnesses attributable to  agent orange and atomic radiation ex posure.  ',I'hese veterans provided our country  with patriotic service under hazardous  conditions. Indeed, the full extent of  the hazards faced by Vietnam veterans  exposed to toxic herbicides containing  dioxin, such as agent orange, and who  suffer from illnesses linked to that ex posure  is not yet fully known. Like wise, veterans who served in the occu pation forces in Hiroshima and Naga saki immediately following World War  II and those who have since participat ed in atmospheric nuclear tests were  serving in the midst of hidden dangers  that are only now coming to light.  This legislation, which provides dis ability benefits  to  these veterans or  their survivors, is only the first step  we must take to insure that this type  of hazard is never faced by our service  men and women in the future. There  is a growing concern and interest in  Congress to find out all we can about  the potential health effects of expo sure  to nuclear radiation and agent  orange-both manmade environmental  hazards of military service. These vet erans served  their country  in good  faith and honorably fulfilled their ob ligations. With  the passage of H.R.  1961 Congress can demonstrate that  we will not tum our backs on our re sponsibilities to those who served their  country at a great personal sacrifice.  ",1984

We think the increases  that we have provided fall within the  terminology  the gentleman  is ques tioning me about.  ",1984
156,756,1,Mr. WALKER., I  thank the gentle man. I guess the problem is that one  man's reasonable increase is another  man's questionable increase. A couple  of years ago we were running inflation  at 12 and 13 percent a year as we ex panded all of these programs. Is the  gentleman saying we are going to in crease the overall inflation rate of the  economy by a tenth of a percent or by  1 percent or what?  ,1984
157,756,1,Mr. PERKINS., Let me say to the  gentleman we are not serving all of  the rural people or all of the metropol itan areas of the country today that  need  these  services. We  are way  behind. But today we are spending $65  million under general assistance. But  the authorization that we are expend ing for 5 years only goes up to $95 mil lion. We may never appropriate the  $95 million. We may never appropriate  more than $80 million or $85 million  or maybe $75 million.  I would say to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania  these  figures are very  modest in my judgment.  ,1984
158,756,1,Mr. WALKER.," If the gentleman will  yield further, is he telling us there is  an inflation tradeoff here and that, in  fact, the passage of this bill, according  to  the committee report, will cause  some increase in inflation? Is that cor rect?  ",1984
159,756,1,Mr. PERKINS., The gentleman  correct.  ,1984
160,756,1,Mr. WALKER., I  man.  ,1984
161,756,1,Mr. PERKINS., But it also provides  additional services.  ,1984
162,756,1,Mr. WALKER.," I  man.  Of course, we have been raising in flation rates for years around here on  the idea that what we are doing is pro viding more services.  But one more question,  if I could.  Under the construction portion of the  bill  is  it anticipated that the Davis Bacon wage rates would apply to all  construction,  thereby  reducing  the  amount of construction that we could  have of libraries for a certain amount  of money,  and  also  limiting  the  number of jobs that would be made  available?

166,756,1,Mr. BARTLETT.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  I have a good deal of respect for  both the chairman of the committee  and  the ranking Republican on  the  subcommittee but I rise to oppose this  bill, H.R. 2878, and I do not rise to  oppose libraries. I support libraries in  this country.  Libraries in this country are funded  at the current rate at the local level of  approximately  $1.5  billion  a  year.  What I oppose, Mr. Chairman, is the  refusal of this Congress in bills such as  this,  including this bill,  to prioritize  Federal programs and Federal spend ing as to what is the most appropriate  and the best use of Federal funds.  We have a widespread availability of  quality libraries and widespread avail ability throughout the country. And  that is important. But I oppose the ex tension of $684 million in additional  spending over the next 4 years.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose the bill pri marily because of  its perpetual  life  feature. Should this bill pass perhaps  we should title it, instead of its cur rent title, we should title it the Perpet ual Federal Spending Program Act of  1984. I think we should examine what  this act would purport to do. I believe  the chairman and the gentleman from  Missouri eloquently gave us reasons  not to reenact this act and pass this  bill, because at best, this program over  the past 25 years has already accom plished its mission. Beginning 25 years  ago, this House, this Federal Govern ment set out to assure the availability  of  libraries  throughout  the country  and we have largely accomplished that  with libraries available in 96 percent  of  the communities  in  this Nation.  Those  libraries are  locally  adminis tered and locally funded, and their pri orities are locally set. Ninety-five per cent or more of all funds for libraries  in this country, $1.5 billion annually,  come from  local needs and we need  quality  libraries. But  that  quality  should be built in at the local level. So,  it is a case of a misson has been at tempted, beginning 25 years ago, and  the mission has been largely accom plished. But at worst, Mr. Chairman,  at worst this is a case of a Federal pro gram which is unnecessary, redundant  and costly, a Federal program which  has assumed a life of its own.  Now,  certainly one could make a  case that some of the funds in this bill  will do some good. There are few Fed eral programs that cannot make that  case. But what the country is asking  us to do, what the American people  would have us do in 1984 is to priori tize the spending of American taxpayers' money and  to say  is  this $684  millon the best use of those funds? We  just passed a bill on agent orange, Mr.  Chairman. which over a 4-year period  would expend $30 million. and I would  ask who among us would say that Fed eral aid to libraries is 20 times more  important  than dealing with  agent  orange?  I would  ask  this Congress  today  to make a  real case  for  the  future, a future of the continued re covery, a future of increasing employ ment and decreasing inflation and de creasing  interest  rates.  I would ask  this Congress  to  think about, very  carefully,  the last recession that we  have just gone through, the recession  that was caused by excessive nonprior itized spending of  this body, and  I  would ask us to take steps to avoid  that next recession.  Mr. Chairman, $180 billion deficits  are not created in the aggregate. At no  time does a bill's sponsor stand here or  in the well and ask for this House to  pass $180 billion expenditure and label  that expenditure deficit. No, sir. The  Members of this body bring that $180  billion to us one bill at a time, one act  at a time, $1 billion in one, $5 billion  in another; sometimes  they ask  for  $684 million. But it is the cumulative  effect of each of those pieces of legis lation, of each of those perpetual Fed eral programs that cause that deficit.  And the risk, and the effect then, is  not so much that there is red ink on  the budget or  that  it shows up  in  someone's campaign expenditure. The  result is in the lives of real American  families who  cannot  find  jobs,  are  thrown out of work. The result of this  bill and others like  it,  the result of  this lack of prioritizing responsibility  is that more Americans are thrown out  of work  and more  senior  citizens  cannot cope with inflation and more  young  families  are  unable  to  buy  homes. I noted the cries last week that  the White House  should  somehow  show sincerity in making a downpay ment on the deficit. It is now Congress  opportunity  today with  this  legisla tion,  to show  that sincerity  to  the  American  people,  to  prove  to  the  American people and to ourselves, that  we are serious about a deficit, that we  are serious about avoiding the next re cession, that we are serious about the  future, we are able to prioritize.  The President likes to make remarks  to this effect, and his favorite quote is:  There is nothing so immortal in the histo ry of the world as the perpetual life of a  Federal program.  And this act.  today. is evidence of  those words.  I  urge  this House  to  prove that at least there is one Feder al program that does not have to be  immortal,  that  it can be sunsetted,  that we can say we have accomplished  our goals and we will prioritize public  spending of Federal dollars.

176,769,1,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, I  thank  the minority leader very much indeed.  I listened very carefully to his words,  with which I agree.  THE LEBANON CRISIS  Mr. President,  in the next several  weeks  the Senate and the House of  Representatives will  once  again be  striving to deal with one of the most  vexing problems we face-the need, on  one hand to do what we can realistical ly to move Lebanon toward peace and,  on the other hand,  to extricate our  marines from their present untenable  situation.  I fear that, left to its own devices,  the administration will  continue  to  drift in its quest for a solution in Leba non, expressing constant hope for the  future, but with little upon which to  base that hope.  I have long believed that the United  States should do what it can to help  Lebanon regain full sovereignty over  its territory and achieve internal rec onciliation. But  there are  limits  to  what we can do.  On January 6, the New York Times  quoted an unnamed White House offi cial  as  saying  that ""the President  wants to stay in Lebanon until there is  stability and until there is a plan for  the withdrawal of foreign forces.""  But except for the period between  the two World Wars and sporadically  after World War II, since the time of  the Crusades, when some of the Chris tian knights fought and tarried in a  sea of Muslims, there has been insta31-059 0-87-25 (Pt. 1)  bility in the area and bloody intercom munal conflict. In  the  last 8 years,  Lebanon has been torn apart as con tinued  instability  and  chaos  have  taken  a  relentless  toll. Given  that  background, the idea of staying until  there is stability in Lebanon is not re alistic. Moreover, United States and  French  forces are not perceived as  being neutral, but rather as supporters  of the status quo involving Christian  dominance of  the government. The  evidence is in the casualty figures. U.S.  forces have suffered 258 killed, includ ing 9 from my State of Rhode Island,  and  76 French  soldiers  have been  killed. In contrast, the Italians have  only suffered two deaths, and the Brit ish none. We and the French are tar geted and are paying a terrible price.  The administration has not made a  persuasive case that U.S.  forces can  achieve anything in Lebanon; nor has  it even explained what would consti tute success. Because of this and the  fact that U.S. forces are perceived as  protagonists in a civil conflict, I be lieve U.S. forces should be withdrawn  and  if possible  replaced by a U.N.  peacekeeping force or by some other  truly neutral force.  I am not alone in questioning the  wisdom of a continued U.S. military  presence in Lebanon.  Mr. President, anyone reading  the  Long Commission report on the tragic  bombing of the marine barracks in Oc tober would have to conclude that our  marines face continuing hostility and  risk. The Long Commission report un derscored the need for emphasis upon  the diplomatic, rather than the mili tary, with its call for ""a more vigorous  and demanding approach for pursuing  diplomatic options.""  Congressman SAM GIBBONS of Flori da was recently quoted as saying that,  ""if  the marines are  in Lebanon  to  fight,  they are  too few;  if they are  there to die, they are too many.""  Last year, during the debate on the  war  powers  authorization  for U.S.  forces in Lebanon, I proposed both in  the Foreign Relations Committee and  on the floor of the Senate, that the  authorization  be  reduced  from  18  months to 6 months. I lost by 1 vote in  the committee and by 24 votes on the  floor, and the situation has deteriorat ed. Shortly before  the Senate  ad journed, I again renewed my effort in  the Foreign Relations Committee  to  shorten  the authorized  time period,  and I believe my motion is still the  pending business before the commit tee.  It is simply not fair to the marines,  their  families,  or  to  the American  people to have 1,500 young men serv ing as hostages to vague and perhaps  unachievable policies. If the marines  are to remain in Lebanon it should be  only on the basis of a clear and achiev able mission, not a mission impossible.  ",1984
177,769,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President,  I  hope now  to continue and conclude  this colloquy, which our distinguished  minority leader has made possible in  cooperation with the eminent ranking  minority member of the Committee on  Foreign Relations.  I would  like  to  offer for the record a brief review of  the efforts made on this side of the  aisle in debate last autumn to modify  a policy that was clearly seen to be  headed for catastrophe.  We spoke then about the realities of  the Middle East and to what we per ceived as  the  leakage of  reality  in  American policy with respect to the  Middle East.  It seemed to us that, at the heart of  the administration's policy, there was  one overwhelming misconception.  the joint resolution Congress adopted,  which was drafted originally by offi cials of the administration,  it is de clared at the outset thatIn  The Congress finds that       the removal  of all foreign forces from Lebanon is an es sential U.S. foreign policy objective in the  Middle East.  Mr. President,  that was not mere  overstatement. It was a declaration of  war on the Government of Syria. The  joint  resolution  that became Public  Law 98-119 asserted it to be ""essen tial"" that we force the Syrian Army  out of Lebanon. For it surely cannot  be talked out. The only way it can be  removed is if it is forced out. This is  the task the United States has set for  itself by adopting the joint resolution  authorizing an extended deployment  of marines in Lebanon. If we adopt  such language casually, others in the  world do not read it casually. They  take it very seriously.  Several times during the debate on  this floor last September, I felt it nec essary to make the simple observation  that we do not have  the power  to  achieve that objective. And, as I said  then,  to  declare  as  essential what  cannot be achieved is to insure failure.  In his great book of 1943, ""U.S. For eign Policy: Shield of the Republic""  Walter Lippmann said:  A foreign policy consists in bringing into  balance, with  a  comfortable  surplus  of  power in reserve, the Nation's commitments  and the Nation's power.  What we did instead was to commit  ourselves to objectives we did not have  the power to achieve and to bring us  into conflict with an absolutely ruth less Syrian regime. Who murdered our  marines and sailors in their barracks  in Beirut last October. The Govern ment of Syria did. Everybody knows  that. I have just returned from four  countries of the region. No one sug gested  to me  that any power other  than Syria was responsible for the ter rorist  incidents  that have beset  the  United States in Lebanon.  The October 23 explosion at the U.S.  Marine  compound  in  Beirut  was  ",1984
178,795,1,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, 4 years  after the Soviet invasion of Afghani stan we hear and read very little about  that brutal war. But, after 4 years of  courageous struggle,  the Afghan  re sistance fighters have overcome tradi tional rivalries and are forming a uni fied front against Soviet aggression. A  recent issue of Newsweek quotes U.S.  intelligence sources as saying that the  freedom fighters are working together  and fighting better. In some areas, the  Afghan rebels so completely control  the countryside  that  isolated Soviet  garrisons must be resupplied by air be cause  freedom  fighters  control  all  roads.  Two articles in the Wall Street Jour nal of January 17, 1984, point out the  importance of continued attention to  the gallant struggle underway in Af ghanistan. As  one  points  out,  the  Afghan freedom fighters are making  great gains,  though world attention  for  their plight has  declined. The  other article reports that the Soviets  are engaged in massive efforts to strip  Afghanistan of its natural resources.  Mr. President, I believe it is impor tant  that  the American  people be  aware of the heroism and the progress  of the freedom-loving peoples of Af ghanistan.  I believe that we should not let this  sordid and brutal invasion by the Sovi ets be forgotten. We should not let the  memory of Afghan students standing  before the rifles of Soviet soldiers and  being shot down  in cold blood fade  from our view. We should not let the  indications  that chemical warfare  is  being utilized against the Afghans go  uncriticized and unnoticed.  There was much  ado  about  the  American press not being allowed to  go to Grenada. I hope that the press  throughout the world will rise up in  indignation and ask to report from an  inside view what  is going on  in Af ghanistan. Not that that expression of  indignation by the world press would  be heeded by the Soviets, but never theless in good conscience it should be  made, and even though we may antici pate the negative response from the  Soviet Union, yet that response should  be spread on the records of history.  The Afghans  have  very  bravely  stood  their ground and with great  losses. Millions of Afghans or at least  hundreds  of  thousa!lds  have  been  forced to leave the country and they  have done so rather to subject them selves to the slavery that would be im posed upon them by the Soviet aggres sors.  The Soviet Union bit off more than  it thought it would have to chew, and  I am quite sure that there has been  disappointment  and  chagrin within  the Soviet hierarchy as to the results  of the  invasion.  I  think  the Soviets  met with greater resistance than they  anticipated. It is  taking longer than  they anticipated for them to subjugate  the very independent and brave people  of Afghanistan.  Nor  can  I  understand why  the  Moslem world does not  rise up  in  anger and  in  righteous  indignation  against the Soviet invasion of Afghani stan.  I  cannot understand why  the  Moslem population inside the Soviet  Union has not become very restive as  they see their fellow Moslems in Af ghanistan being maimed and killed by  Soviet soldiers.  It is something which we should talk  about more, and, as far as I am con cerned, I have tried to call attention  frequently on  this  floor  to what  is  going on before the eyes of the world,  which the eyes of the world to a con siderable extent fail to see. It is a kind  of  international glaucoma which  re moves  from  the  periphery  of  the  vision something that is very sordid,  very brutal, and we should not allow  this to be the case.  I think it is our duty to continue to  talk about  this brutal  invasion, and  continue to support in whatever way  we  can, continue  to urge  that  the  world press be allowed into Afghani stan. Why do not the Soviets wish the  press to see and to be able to report on  what is going on? Surely the Soviets  perter  to  keep  hidden  that which  should be brought to light.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have printed in the RECORD ar ticles from the Wall Street Journal of  January 17, 1984, entitled ""Unherald ed Afghans  In Their Finest Hour,""  and  ""Afgan Resources  Flowing  to  U.S.S.R. Despite  the War; Hungary  Seek Dollars.""  There being no objection, the arti cles were ordered to be printed in the  REcoRD, as follows:  UNHERALDED AFGHANS IN THEIR FINEST HOUR  <By Maggie Gallagher and Charles Bork)  Afghanistan used to be news. When the  Russians invaded in 1979, the U.S. government was  shocked,  the American people  were outraged and the U.S. media were in terested. In the years since, Russian brutal ity in Afghanistan has become passe. One of  the most important conflicts of the decade  has all but disappeared from public view.  For the first eight months of 1980,  the  year  following  the Soviet  invasion,  the  index  to the New York Times  lists more  than 15 pages of articles devoted to Afghan istan. But during the same period in 1983,  the listings for Afghanistan drop to only 1¥2  pages.  Over  the past year,  stories  the media  deemed the most newsworthy were either  that the Soviets are invincible, or that the  U.S.-sponsored peace negotiations between  Pakistan and Kabul were progressing very  nicely. After  three years of  threadbare,  mostly  third-hand  coverage  of  the war  itself. the barons of public opinion suggest ed that peace for Afghanistan was soon to  be  arranged  between  representatives  of  Pakistan and the Soviet-controlled regime  of Babrak Karmal. Now, as these specula tions become untenable, some journalists at tribute  the failure of the negotiations  to  lack of U.S. support.  The  indirect  talks between  the govern ments of General Zia and President Karma!  aim to find a diplomatic solution that will  bring about a peaceful withdrawal of Soviet  troops  from Afghanistan. Pakistan  is  a  party to  these negotiations because three  million Afghan refugees have settled within  its borders. Pakistan is also the main route  through which what outside military aid  the mujahedeen receives is channeled. It is  one of those polite diplomatic fictions that  President Karma!, whose government  re mains  in power only by virtue of Soviet  tanks, is the representative from Afghani stan in these negotiations.  The Soviets have adroitly used these ne gotiations to mitigate the political damage  they incur from their occupation of Afghan istan. The invasion caused the Soviet Union  to  lose credibility  in much of  the Third  World and blunted its carefully cultivated  image in Europe as the peace-loving super power. By allowing the Karma! government  to negotiate. the Soviets raise hopes that a  peaceful resolution to the war is just around  the comer-making the U.S. appear the ag gressive power for continuing to urge the  mujahedeen to resist.  There are many problems with the peace  plan under discussion, but the insurmount able stumbling block is the Soviet Union's  insistence on its right to maintain a govern ment in Kabul that is ""friendly"" to it. A  friendly  government  one  that would  retain Soviet military advisers and could be  counted on to reissue  the famed ""invita tion"" to an invasion should the Afghan free dom fighters become too successful.  But how can Afghanistan have a govern ment  that  is at once acceptable  to  the  Soviet Union and the Afghan people? There  is, after all, some difference of opinion be tween the two sides: One will tolerate only a  Soviet-controlled  regime,  and  the  other  wants to kill every Russian in Afghanistan,  along with the Russians' collaborators and  sympathizers.  Hundreds of thousands of Afghans have  died since the Soviets began their war on  Afghanistan. The fighting hasn't been limit ed to soldiers. Because the vast majority of  Afghans oppose the Soviet presence, the So viets bomb whole villages and round up and  massacre unarmed civilians. In the long run,  the cruelest practice of the Russians is the  firebombing of harvest-ripe fields. A coun try that five years ago was on the brink of  agricultural self-sufficiency now faces mas sive starvation. The Afghanistans will not  soon forgive the Soviet Union.  One headline announced earlier this year  that the occupiers were ""Nearing a Pullout  From Afghanistan."" Accompanying this op timism regarding Soviet  intentions in the  area are some oddly pessimistic accounts of  is  ",1984
179,834,1,Mr. HATCH.,"  I  have  consistently  supported S. 1762 and commend each  of the sponsors who have worked dili gently to bring this vital legislation to  the floor of the Senate. As an ardent  supporter of any legislation to address  our crime  crisis,  I  am enthusiastic  about the prospects of enacting these  important reforms, Nonetheless I feel  that the improvements this bill makes  in the insanity defense do not suffi ciently reform this area of the law.  In the wake of the extensive media  coverage of the Hinckley assassination  attempt and  trial,  the public outcry  for changes  in  the  insanity defense  has been clear and sustained. Unfortu nately I fear that the reformed stand ard for the insanity defense in S. 1762  may have also acuitted Mr. Hinckley.  Under  the standard currently  in S.  1762, Hinckley would have to be ac quitted if he ""was unable to appreciate  the nature and quality or the wrong fulness of his acts.""  Mr. Hinckley alleged  in  trail and  supplied psychiatric testimony to bol ster his contention that his delusional  relationship with an actress prevented  him from appreciating the nature and  quality of his act. The breath and am biguity of the term ""appreciate,"" still  a part of the current S. 1762 provision,  allowed Mr. Hinckley to escape culpa bility  for deliberately attempting  to  kill the President. The jury was per suaded  that his behavior was suffi ciently aberrational  to prevent him  from  appreciating  the  nature  and  quality of his murder attempt. The  former  president  of  the American  Academy of Psyciatry, Dr. Abraham  Halpern, analyzing the Hinckley case  in light of the ""appreciation"" test, also  concluded  that  the  test  in S. 1762  would be likely to acquit Hinckley if  he were retried under its standards.  It is important for the Congress to know  that under the insanity rules proposed in S.  1762, the trial of John Hinckley would have  taken the same course and ended with the  same verdict as it did under the American  Law Institute rule employed in the court in  which he was tried. The same members of  the  faculty  of Harvard Medical School  would have testified that he was ""severely  mentally ill and that ""brain scans show that  his brain is slightly shrunken and has more  folds and ventricles than is usual in people  his age."" The same University of Maryland  professor of psychiatry would have told the  jury  that Hinckley suffers from ""process  schizophrenia, a disease marked by a very  severe and very grave course."" The same  Yale University psychiatrist would have tes tified that Hinckley has a major ""depressive  disorder, borderline schizophrenia and para noid personality disorder"" The same Dis trict of Columbia psychiatrist would have  informed the jury that the defendant had a  ""Schizotypal personality disorder with re gression under stress to psychosis."" Thus all  the defense experts would have testified as  they did in the actual trial, that Hinckley  had a severely abnormal mental condition  that grossly impaired his understanding of  reality rendering him unable to appreciate  the wrongfulness of his conduct. It is evi dent that the rule proposed in S. 1762 to  ""narrow  the  insanity defense"" would do  nothing  to  lessen  the  tarnishing of  the  public sense of justice engendered by the  typical insanity trial in federal courts.  Dr. Halpern's conclusion is bolstered  by the experience of New York State  which has had a test remarkably simi lar to that found in S. 1762 for the  past 20  years. Under  that  test, ap proximately 100 defendants-primari ly accused of violent offenses-have  been acquitted by the insanity defense  each  year. Nationwide,  over  1,000  yearly escape conviction by pleading  insanity.  Under my amendment, however, Mr.  Hinckley could not be acquitted. My  amendment would  not  allow Mr.  Hinckley to argue that his apprecia tion was impaired. With regard to in sanity, Hinckley could only argue that  he lacked the state of mind require ment, the mens rea, necessary for of fense  of  attempted murder.  Since  Hinckley actually intended to kill the  President, an act he  referred  to as  ""historic""  in one of  the  letters he  wrote prior to the attempt, he would  have been guilty of the offense. Hinck ley admitted in his trial that he in tended to kill the President, but con tended that he ""lacked substantial ca pacity to appreciate"" the wrongfulness  of his acts.  Under my amendment, the exhaus tive pyschiatric  testimony presented  by Hinckley would have been irrele vant to the question of guilt. It would  have been, however,  relevant to the  question of sentencing. This alterna tive to insanity reform would have al lowed a separate hearing entirely on  the subject of Hinckley's mental con dition prior to sentencing. The judge  could then have modified Hinckley's  sentence  to  insure  that he  received  proper treatment. This alternative is  not harsh. It insures that someone al leging mental impairment gets both a  chance to assert that the mental ill ness prevented him from committing  the crime and the chance to receive  hospitalization and appropriate  sen tencing for the nature of the impair ment in the event the illness did not  impair his intent to commit a crime.  John Hinckley  deliberately  chose  the only  six  exploding  (devastator>  bullets he had from among 37 other  bullets when he  loaded his  pistol.  With the specific intention of killing  the President, he went to where he  knew the President would be and, in  full  view  of  the American  public,  almost succeeded in accomplishing his  purpose. He did severely wound the  President  and  three other persons,  some of whom are not likely to ever  return to the same quality of life. This  event is primarily responsible for our  effort to reform the insanity defense.  Under  the  current  bill,  Hinckley  would, in all likelihood, still be acquit ted. Under my amendment, Hinckley  would most certainly be convicted. At  the very least, we should insure that  our effort today is sufficiently effec tive to change the result in the Hinck ley case.  Generations of Federal judges have  struggled to define the circumstances  under which mentally abnormal of fenders should be held responsible for  their conduct, without notable success.  As Dr. Abraham Halpern, the distin guished psychiatrist, has noted, ""in sanity has come  to mean anything  anybody wants it to mean.""  The  traditional  insanity defense  is  both a  legal anachronism and a con cept ill-suited to modern psychological  theory. It presents issues-important  issues-that are not susceptible of in telligent resolution in the courtroom  environment. Trials in which the in sanity defense has been raised have  often degenerated into swearing con tests  between  opposing  teams  of  expert witnesses,  all  of whom  are  forced to translate the language of the  psychiatric profession  into the quite  alien language of the legal profession.  It is this attempt to marry these two  incompatible disciplines that has cre ated the current confusion.  The insanity defense evolved princi pally as a means by which English ju rists could avoid-in a legally rational  mann.er-the  discomfiture  of  con demning to death a felon who was so  mentally deranged that his execution  would affront ordinary moral sensibili ties. As Lord Erskine stated in the ear liest years of the 19th century, ""delu sion ... is the true character of insan ity.""  Individuals  suffering  in  this  manner could not truly be considered  ""responsible"" in the legal sense.  Although the criminal law over the  years  substituted  imprisonment and  lesser penalties for capital punishment  and substituted judicial discretion for  mandatory penalties, the insanity de fense, as an exception to the ordinary  consequences of criminal conduct, sur vived the former strict legal require ments which it has been designed to  avoid.  Even within the psychological com munity, the insane asylum, which once  served as a warehouse for the crimi nally insane, has become just a brief  steppingstone back to the street.  In the United States, the Congress  has never enacted legislation on the  insanity defense. Its development has  largely been left to the courts, particu larly the courts of appeals. The foun dation of the present defense was laid  down in M'Naghten's case <8 Eng. Rep.  718 <House of Lords, 1843)) in which it  was statedTo establish a defense on the ground of  insanity, it must be clearly proved that at  ",1984
180,873,1,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, I should  like to respond briefly to the Senator  from Maryland regarding his amend ment.  Although  this  amendment  affects  the intent of Congress, it is impossible  to predict with certainty whether or  not the prison population will increase  at any time in the future because of  these new guidelines. For example,  what  if  there  is a  sudden  large  in crease in terrorist activities? What if  there is a sudden large increase, such  as we had in the 1960's, with respect to  violence on campuses, or any number  of things that are affected by trends  that occur in this country?  Should persons,  for example, who  are involved in terrorist activities-and  I want to make it clear that I am not  making a comparison between terror ism and what happened on the cam puses  in  the 1960's, because  that is  where  I was  in  the 1960's-should  those persons who otherwise would be  imprisoned be  released  to accommo date  terrorists because  there  is  an  influx of terrorism?  If the new guidelines, on their face,  would result in a net increase in the  prison  population,  Congress  could  reject  them and ask  the Sentencing  Commission to draft new ones, more in  line with  congressional  intent,  and  Congress could face up to the issue of  what it is going  to do about prison  size.  The  amendment,  though well-in tended, is too vague. From what point  in time will aggregate terms or average  terms be determined? Does  inmate  population include persons detained in  State institutions, in halfway houses,  or on furlough?  Mr. President, there is a consistency  to all  the amendments  the Senator  has offered. If you accept his basic  premise, they all have compelling rea sons to be adopted. But I do not think  the basic premise on which the Sena tor  from Maryland  is proceeding  is  that sound, which is that, automatical ly, prison population will increase and  that this lack of discretion on the part  of the judges will produce this hemor rhaging new statistic.

197,886,1,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to introduce legislation today  which I believe has both practical and  symbolic importance to this country's  energy policy. Specifically, I am pro posing legislation to amend the Home  Energy Assistance Act to allow States  to use up to 25 percent of funds dis tributed under the low income energy  assistance program for weatherization  in accordance with the Department of  Energy's present weatherization pro gram.  This proposal would  impose abso lutely no new  requirements on  the  States, would require no new appro priations or funding, and would not es tablish any new programs. Rather this  legislation merely allows the States to  determine  the most effective use of  moneys Congress has already appro priated,  thereby strengthening  their  ability  to meet the energy needs of  low-income  families  and  individuals  under  the Home Energy Assistance  Act.  Both weatherization and fuel assist ance are designed to meet the same  overall  goal;  that  is,  to help  low income  families  cope with  today's  energy problems. I firmly believe, Mr.  President, that the most effective and  commonsense way of  insuring  that  this goal is met is to give States-who  are  far more  familiar with  their  energy needs than the Federal Gov ernment-flexibility  to use  the pro grams together.  I recognize that in the short term,  low-income fuel assistance funds are  indeed necessary to help poor families  pay this winter's heating bills.

198,938,1,Mr. CORCORAN.," Mr. Speaker, a  January 9 Wall Street Journal article  by Alan Bayless reports that the out look for energy pricing may provide  good news  indeed. Mr. Bayless dis cusses  the predictions of Mr. Arion  Tussing, an economist who has com piled an impressive record in the past  few years for accurate forecasts in the  area of energy pricing. The article fo cuses on gas, but also discusses oil,  coal,  and electricity, particularly  in  connection with U.S.  imports  from  Canada.  For  the benefit of our colleagues,  Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in  the REcORD  the  text of the Bayless  January 9 Wall Street Journal article.  [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 9, 19841  NATURAL-GAS PRESSURE BUILDS TO A HEAD  <By Alan Bayless)  VANcouvER.-Arlon Tussing,  a maverick,  50-year-old economist, has compiled an im pressive record in the past few years for ac curate but controversial  forecasts  in  the  volatile world of energy pricing.  In the fall of 1980, for example, he pre dicted correctly that international oil prices  were peaking, even though the world-wide  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  consensus was for a continuous and rapid  upward spiral  throughout  this decade. A  year  later, U.S.  gas  pipelines put  their  future in peril by ignoring his criticism of  the trend toward high-priced and inflexible  gas-purchase contracts with producers.  ""The most fashionable slogan in the in dustry may soon be 'I can't take and I won't  pay. So sue me,' "" he and colleague Connie  Barlow told a meeting of energy economists  in November 1981. Within 18 months,. the  prediction came true as Tenneco Inc. and  Columbia Gas Systems Inc. reneged on huge  domestic purchase contracts. More recently,  Panhandle Eastern Corp. suspended its 20year contract  to buy expensive  liquefied  natural gas from Algeria.  These days, Mr. Tussing's Seattle-based  consulting business is booming, even though  he rejects the popular wisdom that recent  sluggish energy prices will stabilize or begin  rising with continued economic growth and  cold weather.  Instead, Mr. Tussing confi dently  predicts  that  inexorable market  forces will keep forcing down these prices  for 10 years. Canada could play an impor tant role in the price decline because it has  so much excess energy to sell in the U.S.  GAS OVERLOOKED  Mr. Tussing's forecast stems in part from  his analysis of natural gas, a  fuel usually  overlooked in favor of oil when energy price  trends are examined. In the past, the over sight has been justified, largely because gov ernment regulation made gas-price analysis  unnecessary in the U.S.,  the world's most  important energy market.  But major structural changes are creating  a powerful and competitive U.S. gas-price  market for the first time. The overall, long term energy-price decline will be caused by  a  growth  of  this  competition,  not  just  within the gas industry but between gas and  other fuels, Mr. Tussing says. The impact  on natural-gas pipelines could be particular ly painful as they leave their risk-free, regu lated environment.  On the surface, the forecast may appear  ridiculous, because consumer gas prices are  continuing to soar despite a gas-supply glut.  In fact, a recent study by the U.S. Energy  Information Administration says consumers  can expect to pay 10% more for gas during  1984 even though oil prices won't change  much. But Mr. Tussing expects  these  in creases to be transitory, because they result  not from market pressure, but from errors  the gas industry committed after decades of  federal price controls were amended by the  Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.  Almost overnight, the new law eliminated  the gas shortages of the mid-1970s by creat ing more market flexibility and by allowing  certain limited categories of gas to be sold  at very high prices. The gas industry, how ever, continued to expect the reappearance  of shortages. Those ingrained expectations,  which haven't fully disappeared, led produc ers to discover and pipelines to contract for  too much of the newly decontrolled sup plies. At the same time, the pipelines also  invested far too much in new transportation  systems  for expensive Canadian, Mexican  and Algerian gas.  Because old gas prices had been kept so  far below their market value, the pipelines  combined  the expensive  and  inexpensive  gases and transmission rates and passed the  increasingly higher average price on to their  customers. But the price boosts have infuri ated gas users, creating a hot political issue.  In 1983, the Reagan administration pro posed to resolve matters with an unprece dented  law  that would void existing conJanuary 30, 1984  tracts between gas pipelines and producers  and permit free negotiations for new and  presumably lower average wellhead prices.  Some congressmen, on  the other hand,  want to extend existing price controls and  force a price rollback in time for the 1984  election. If neither side can muster enough  votes, as seems  likely, all gas discovered  since 1978 would be decontrolled next Jan. 1  under the 1978 law, while older gas would  remain controlled until the wells run dry.  The last alternative has raised fears that  average wellhead  prices  and  consumer  prices will be forced up even more. That is  because many existing contracts allow de controlled-gas producers to charge the high est possible rates and because the cushion ing effect of inexpensive older gas is gradu ally disappearing.  But Mr. Tussing doubts that prices can  rise much more, because gas already costs so  much  that users are  conserving,  closing  down or switching  to cheaper fuels. The  process is creating a ""death spiral"" for some  interstate pipelines and  local distributors  because the increased cost of transporting  smaller amounts of gas in tum causes even  more of a decline in demand, he says. To re verse the spiral, pipelines are being forced  to change tactics and negotiate a competi tive ""spot market"" price for users that could  switch fuels. This, says Mr. Tussing, will  quickly lead to a two or three tier gas-user  market and even a gas-futures market tied  to spot prices.  The first  tier would  involve households  and other small buyers, providing a base  level of long-term demand. It would contin ue to require regulatory protection because  such gas users wouldn't have the clout to  negotiate prices.  Big industrial customers would make up  the second tier. Because of their ability to  bargain with pipelines for the cheapest sup plies, they wouldn't require any regulatory  protection. The third tier would involve the  growing  ""contract  carriage"" market,  in  which producers sell directly  to end-users  and then buy the cheapest available trans portation.  Mr. Tussing argues  that regulators are  more  likely  to foster competition than to  prevent it, because, in any event, they can't  stop energy users from seeking the lowest cost supplier. ""A little bit of competition is  subversive.  It spreads  like a  cancer,"" he  says. The competition leads him to forecast  that  some  pipelines  eventually will  be  forced to seek Chapter 11 protection from  creditors under U.S. bankruptcy  laws be cause he doubts the marketplace will for give past errors.  ""Manville Corp. and Continental Airlines  have shown how permissive U.S. bankruptcy  laws can be used as a business strategy,'' he  says. ""Even if pipelines are showing good  profits, they may have to use the same tool  to get out of their contracts.""  The faster regulators allow the competi tion to grow, the faster Mr. Tussing expects  a weakening not just in gas prices but in  such gas substitutes as oil, electricity and  coal. All four energy sources are in excess  supply at current prices, he asserts. The  international oil price, of course, depends on  the ability of the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries to maintain production  at levels far below capacity and far below  the needs of most of the cartel's members.  Mr. Tussing expects continuing pressure on  OPEC to force down the price in the spring.  Less well  known  is Canada's growing  desire to sell cut-rate electricity to the U.S.,  even though some of the power may replace  ",1984
199,951,1,Mr. GORE.," Mr. Speaker, I am de lighted  to  join with Congressman  GLENN ANDERSON  to  introduce H.R.  4616 a bill to improve child passenger  safety.  Over the last three decades we have  seen the death rate for preschool chil dren decline by 53 percent. Virtually  all of this decline resulted from a 62percent reduction in death rates from  medical illness. In contrast, the rate of  child passenger deaths remained un changed. Highway death is  the only  major cause of death for these chil dren  that has not declined.  In fact  today it is the single leading cause of  death of children. For this reason I be lieve we must immediately recognize  that highway deaths and injuries are  the number one public health threat  that all our children face.  The bill we are introducing provides  a program to meet this challenge. It  encourages  each State  to  combine  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  their wisdom and expertise in adminis tering programs within their State to  put forth a child passenger safety pro gram that will work best in that indi vidual State.  Last session  I  introduced  the bill  H.R. 3483, the Child Highway Safety  Act. While I continue to believe the  concepts embodied in that legislation  are  those  that we must ultimately  strive for, H.R. 4616 represents an im portant first step on that road.  The Federal Government's interest  in protecting the Nation's children has  a long and successful history. Federal  dollars have been well spent for State  programs  in maternal  and  child  health, nutrition, primary care, and  immunizations. The combined Feder al/State programs in these areas have  resulted in the significant decline of  deaths due to medical illness I cited  earlier. We must now turn our atten tion to motor vehicle safety and put  an end to the senseless and easily pre ventable  tragedy of so many of our  children needlessly dying on our high ways.  I have a special interest in this legis lation  for  two  reasons: First,  as  a  father of four young children I have a  special empathy for families who have  had to suffer the death or crippling  injury to a child involved in a motor  vehicle accident; and second, this bill  builds upon the hard work of many of  my fellow Tennesseans, as Tennessee  was the first State to enact a law re quiring  the use of child safety  re straints 7 years  ago.  I  particularly  would like to note the efforts of Dr.  Robert Sanders, Dr. Sam Carney, Dr.  Ed Caldwell, and Mr. Edward Casey.  Mr. Casey of Nashville, Tenn.,  first  had  the  idea  for a  child passenger  safety law back  in 1975. Dr. Robert  Sanders of Murfreesboro, Tenn., with  the help of his wife Pat and Drs.  Carney and Caldwell, worked tirelessly  to see that vision realised.  Through an act that has truly dem onstrated  unique  dedication,  they  have taken Mr. Casey's idea and today  deserve the thanks of all of us for the  great strides that have been made. Be cause of the overwhelming success of  Tennessee's child highway safety law,  40 other States plus the District of Co lumbia .have passed similar laws man dating the use of child restraints by  preschool children.  Hearings on this legislation will be  held before the Subcommittee on Sur face Transportation following the Feb ruary district work period. I am hope ful and optimistic that with the broad,  bipartisan  support  this  legislation  enjoys, it can become law before the  end of year.e  949  HAS THE ARMS RACE BEEN  ONE-SIDED?  HON. LEE H. HAMILTON  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 30, 1984  e ",1984
200,951,1,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker, Last  November  22,  Defense  Secretary  Caspar Weinberger wrote an article  for the Washington Post entitled, ""We  Must Not Be Paralyzed by Fear."" The  article was written in response to the  TV  production  ""The Day After,""  which dramatized the effects of a nu clear war. Secretary Weinberger said  in his article that, while in the face of  the Soviet nuclear buildup we must  improve our existing forces, this does  not mean we are seeking to increase  our nuclear arsenal. The Secretary  also observed  that,  for  the  last 15  years, there has been a one-sided arms  race: A race the United States has not  entered.  I was moved by Secretary Weinberg er's thoughtful article to write to him  to ask a number of questions about  the  Soviet military  buildup.  Just  shortly before the Secretary's article  was written, the Joint Economic Com mittee  released  the CIA's latest  re vised  estimates  of  Soviet military  spending. Secretary Weinberger and   other Pentagon  officials  have  fre quently referred to the rapid Soviet  military buildup and the fact that it  failed to slow down in the 1970's de spite reduced levels of military spend ing by  the United States. But  the  recent CIA estimates show that the  growth of Soviet defense spending did  slow down in the 1970's. It went from  a 4-5 percent annual rate of growth in  the first half of the decade to a 2-per cent growth in the second half. Fur ther, Soviet spending for military pro curement  leveled off  in  the period  1977-81, according to the CIA.  My purpose in writing to Secretary  Weinberger was to find out how the  new estimates may have  influenced  Defense Department assessments of  the Soviet military buildup. It is obvi ous from his  response  to my  letter  that  the CIA's latest estimates are  being  incorporated  into  the Defense  Department's  assessments,  as  they  should be. One of the points made by  Secretary Weinberger is  that, in the  period 1976 to 1981, Soviet military in vestment grew at an average annual  rate of 2-3 percent in dollar cost terms  compared to a 5.8-percent rate for the  United States. In response to my first  question, it is stated that U.S. spend ing for strategic forces grew at an av erage  annual  rate  of  5-6  percent  during that period, while Soviet costs  of strategic forces did not grow at all.  Elsewhere, he observes that the Sovi ets have, in the past, spent far more  for defense than we have and that the  ",1984

205,964,1,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  am aware that exporting Alaska crude  oil  is an emotional  issue  for many  people. Over the last year, I have tried  to build the substantive case for limit ed exports and I have often been faced  with  the  task  of  diffusing  highly  charged  political  rhetoric.  regret  that this emotional response by the  opponents of any export stands in the  way of our objective consideration of  this issue, causing us to forego some  very substantial benefits for the Amer ican people. Thus, I would once again  like to try to place the issue of limited  Alaska oil exports in perspective.  I understand my colleagues in the  Senate are concerned about the poten tial impacts on the U.S. maritime in dustry which might be associated with  large export volumes. That concern  has been clearly demonstrated by the  level of support they have given to leg islation <S. 1159> which would extend  the current ban indefinitely.  The Senate will shortly consider the  Export Administration Act. At  that  time, I will offer an amendment to S.  979,  the Export Administration Act,  which would allow the export of up to  200,000  barrels per day <bbl/ d>  of  Alaska crude oil  to our Pacific rim  allies with  the provision  that  it be  moved in U.S.-flag vessels. My amend ment is consistent with the intent of  S. 1159 and addresses its sponsors' con cerns in two fundamental ways.  First, S. 1159 was premised on the  assumption that proponents of easing  export restrictions seek to export all  1.6 million bbl/d of North Slope pro duction on foreign tankers. My amend ment sets a ceiling on export at 12.5  percent of  that production  (200,000  ",1984
206,977,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr.  President,  the pending amendment would pro vide for issuance of sentencing guide lines by the Judicial Conference. Such  guidelines would be developed by a  part-time  nine member  Sentencing  Commission appointed by the Judicial  Conference  to be made up of  five  judges and four nonjudges. Minimal  congressional guidance is provided to  the Commission. The purposes of the  guidelines are to promote fairness and  certainty in sentencing;  to eliminate  unwarranted disparity  in sentencing;  and to improve the administration of  justice. The amendment would require  that the guidelines provide for the im position of the least severe sentence  necessary to achieve the purposes of  sentencing set forth in the bill and au thorize the judicial conference to des ignate appropriate offenses for which  imprisonment would not be appropri ate. Such sentencing guidelines are re quired to minimize the likelihood that  the Federal  prison  population will  exceed  the capacity of  the Federal  prisons.  Mr. President, this brief summary of  the amendment is sufficient to draw  some comparisons with  the bill. By  contrast the bill provides for a seven person independent Sentencing Com mission to be appointed by the Presi dent, with the advice and consent of  the Senate, after consultation with  representatives of groups interested in  the criminal  justice process. Two of  the seven members may be judges. All  positions on the Commission would be  fulltime positions for 6 years following  the effective date of the first compre hensive set of guidelines;  thereafter  only the position of chairman would  be fulltime. Statutory guidance to the  Commission is considerably more de tailed in setting forth the factors to be  considered and discourages broad judi cial discretion by requiring each guide line to be relatively narrowly drawn.  The bill, in addition, does not mandate  a  lock-step consideration of types of  sentences from the least severe to the  most severe; instead, the bill seeks to  have  the Commission  focus on  the  proper sanction for each category of  defendant for the offense charged. It,  therefore, directs the Commission to  assure imprisonment in certain types  of cases, such as repeat violent offend ers, while discouraging  incarceration  ",1984

208,990,1,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, ex cluding  these periods of delay will  insure, for example, that a defendant  who must undergo substantial psychi atric testing to determine his or her  mental  competency,  as  did  John  Hinckley, will not simply be released  after 60 days. Other examples include  those periods of delay resulting from  the absence of unavailability of an es sential witness; a continuance granted  by a  judge  if  the  judge determines  that ""the ends of  justice"" are best  served by the continuance; or from the  transportation of a defendant to an other  district.  I  believe  excluding  these periojs of delay from the 60-day  time limitation should allay the fears  of  those who fear an absolute  time  limitation would prove unworkable.  I believe deeply that in certain cir cumstances, courts  should have  au thority to detain defendants prior to  trial. At the same time, I believe equal ly strongly that the Government has  an overriding obligation  to expedite  the trial of those so detained, because  that detention conflicts directly with  the presumption of  innocence until  guilt  is proved, which  is one of the  foundations of our judicial system.  I emphasize to my colleagues that  we are talking here about a situation  in which an American citizen is put in  prison before he or she has been con victed of anything. All that has hap pened is that a person is charged with  a crime. Anyone even remotely famil iar with the American judicial system  knows that not every person charged  with a crime is guilty and subsequent ly proved guilty.  Frankly, I cannot comprehend oppo sition to this rather modest proposal,  and  I  am deeply disappointed  that  there apparently  is so little support  for this revision in the Senate that it  will not even be put to a vote. I think  that says something about the Senate  and its concern, or lack of concern,  about the rights of American citizens.  I hope very much  that as  this bill  works its way through the legislative  process in the House and in confer ence, this change will be made~ One final point: One of the Argu ments against this provision is that we  already have in place a speedy trial act  that says that a defendant will have to  be tried within 90 days, so what is an other 30 days to someone who  is in  jail?  The first answer to that is that if  you are in jail and have not been con victed of anything, and you are in fact  innocent, 1 day in jail is too much.  The second argument, and I think a  more significant argument,  is that if  this bill passes, as it likely will, it will  become a model  for  the 50 States,  many of which are now considering  legislation of this type, and very few  of those States have a S!leedy trial act.  In fact, most violent crimes  in  this  country are prosecuted under State  law, not under Federal law.  Mr. President, we are about to pass a  measure which is likely to serve as a  model for each of the 50 States, many  of which are now considering legisla tion of  this  type. The number of  crimes of violence prosecuted unde:  Federal  law  in  this country  is very  small. The overwhelming majority of  violent crimes are prosecuted under  State law, and appropriately so.  Most States do not have a  speedy  trial act, and if those States adopt this  Federal legislation as a model, we will  run the risk of having many, many  American  citizens  in  jail without  having been convicted of anything,  who are in fact not guilty, and without  any specific time limit for their trial  being set. That, I think, is inconsistent  with the objective and the purposes of  American  justice,  and  inconsistent  with the provisions of the Constitu tion.  I hope very much, as I have said,  that  this  legislation  proceeds  through  the  legislative process,  this  very modest change will be adopted,  for the reasons I have suggested.  as  It is a very sad commentary on the  Senate that  there are so  few votes  that we will not even put it to a vote.

211,1003,1,Mr. HEFLIN.," Mr.  President,  the  amendment I am offering would strike  all of the language in the portion of S.  1762 which would amend rule 704 of  the Federal Rules of Evidence. It is my  belief that expert witnesses should be  allowed to testify to the ultimate issue  in cases involving mental diseases and  defects. As a former trial lawyer and  also as a former judge, I recognize the  value of preserving the province of the  jury, but I also recognize the value in  providing jurors with appropriate as sistance when  they  are  confronted  with situations beyond their expertise.  As the common law has developed, it  has become evident that expert wit nesses are indispensible when highly  scientific or technical matters arise.  In other matters  litigated  in our  State and Federal courts, we rely on  expert testimony of engineers, archi tects, physicians, and others. And yet  we seek to deny the jury the use of  complete and sufficient expert  testi mony in dealing with the frailties of  the human mind. I submit that it is  precisely these cases in which expert  testimony is crucial. The intricacies of  the human mind and  the years of  training required by psychiatrists and  psychologists indicate that this aspect  of medicine extends far beyond the or dinary  training,  knowledge,  intelli gence, and expertise of the average  juror. To argue that by allowing this  testimony the expert usurps the func tion of the jury, as has been stated by  the noted professor on evidence Dean  Wigmore, a ""mere bit of empty rhetoric.""    Mr. President, I would like to turn to  the  language. For  those who have  before them a copy of the bill, I would  like to suggest that they turn in the  bill to page 177, on which the affirma tive defense of insanity appears. And I  want to read this.  It is an affirmative defense to a prosecu tion under any Federal statute that, at the  time of the commission of the acts consti tuting  the offense,  the defendant,  as  a  result of a severe mental disease or defect,  was unable  to appreciate  the nature and  quality or  the wrongfulness of his acts.  Mental disease or defect does not otherwise  constitute a defense.  Later,  I will  read  from page 204,  which pertains to the expert testimo ny element of the defense.  At this time I think it would be ap propriate to try to evaluate the various elements  in  the affirmative de . fense of insanity that has been drafted  by the committee and is now before  the Senate.  First, it allows for the defense if five  elements are present. I think the first  element is ""as a result""-of the second  element, a ""mental disease or defect.""  The third element requires that the  mental disease or defect be ""severe""  and,  because  of  that  severity,  the  fourth element must result-the  in ability to appreciate.  The fifth element is the inability to  appreciate the nature and quality of  his acts or, in the alternative, the fail ure to appreciate the wrongfulness of  his acts.  I want to pay particular attention to  the fourth and fifth elements com bined:  inability  to  appreciate  the  nature and quality of his acts. And I  will refer to those later.  Part A of section 406, of this legisla tion would retain the language that we  already have under rule 704 of  the  Federal Rules of Evidence. This lan guage was developed through the Ju dicial Conference of the United States  and submitted to Congress. This lan guage provides,  under Federal  law,  that ""testimony  in  the  form of an  opinion or inference otherwise admis sible  is not objectionable because  it  embraces an ultimate issue to be decid ed by the trier of fact.""  Through the development of the law  in the Federal courts, as well as in the.  new rules of evidence, as promulgated  under the Federal Rules of Evidence,  testimony going  to  to  the ultimate  issue has been allowed. That is  the  way the law is today.  This bill would put one limitation on  it. That limitation would involve cases  involving mental disease or defects. I  will refer to this limiting language as  the exclusionary expert witness rule,  let us examine the language and see  what it does.  No expert witness testifying with respect  to the mental state or condition of a defend ant in a criminal case may state an opinion  or inference as to whether the defendant  did or did not have the mental state or con dition constituting an element of the crime  charged or of a defense thereto.  That says, in effect, that no witness  in a criminal case with respect to the  mental state or condition may state an  opinion or an  inference  as  to  the  mental state or condition constituting  an element of a defense thereto.  I think you have to analyze that lan guage carefully. It states, first, that he  cannot state an opinion. Second, he  cannot state an inference.  What is an opinion in medical testi mony? An opinion is a diagnosis. A di agnosis is clearly an opinion. Any con clusion that a doctor or lawyer, or any  person who belongs  to any  learned  profession, reaches is referred to as an  opinion.  An inference under this language is  much more narrow than an opinion or  a diagnosis. It extends to anyone who  would give an inference in regards to a  diagnosis.  This language is subject to the inter pretation that a symptom would be an  inference. A coalescing of symptoms  would be an inference relative to an  opinion or to a diagnosis.  Now we go further and it says that  an expert cannot state whether the  defendant did or did not have  the  mental state or condition. Is a mental  disease or defect a mental state or con dition? Is a mental disease a mental  state?  Is a mental defect a mental  state?  Is a mental disease a mental  condition? Is a mental defect a mental  condition? Undoubtedly, the answer is  yes to all of these questions.  This language, is extremely restric tive. Some may say, ""Well, we have  put into the language of the report  certain language that would allow for  the doctor to testify as to a diagnosis.""  But somehow or other, I do not believe  that the Department of Justice, who,  as Senator HATFIELD a while ago men tioned, stone walled certain things rel ative  to  this bill, have carefully  re viewed some changes that are occur ring and some consequences that will  occur to the prosecution as a result of  it.  No. 1, only in rare instances has the  U.S. Supreme Court ever granted cer tiorari  in a  case  involving evidence.  Trial judges will be the ones reviewing  the language of the statute. I have, to  my knowledge, never known a  trial  judge in a trial of a criminal case, to  be able to review the report of a legis lative committee or to review legisla tive history. Nc. 1, he does not have  time.  It is an unrealistic viewpoint.  Perhaps an appellate court might. The  language here is extremely restrictive;  it clearly provides that an opinion or  an inference concerning a mental con dition or state of mind cannot be  stated. This is certainly a logical inter pretation of this language.  I can foresee trial judges, as a result  of this language, saying that an expert  cannot testify that a defendant, had a  mental disease, had a mental defect, or  had a mental disorder. Then, under  this, he could not name  the mental  disease or the mental defect. He could  not express an opinion or an inference  on the severity of it.  The language concerning the severi ty of a mental disease or defect that  has been incorporated by the commit tee, and I think justly so, and I sup ported it, is different from the Ameri can Law  Institute's  language. The  issue can well come down to whether a  person does or does not have a severe  mental disease, particularly where the  diagnosis of a mental disorder is based  on documentary evidence, such as hos pital records. This, is going to largely  .  ",1984

213,1016,1,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, The Sena tor from Kansas wishes to take this  opportunity  to  provide  some  back ground and detail on his various legis lative efforts to strengthen the Feder al role in helping the States and local  jurisdiction deal with the potentially  explosive prison problems facing our  Nation. These efforts are now included  in S. 1762, the Comprehensive Crime  Control Act of 1983. The four primary  areas in which this Senator has active ly been involved are first, criminal jus tice facilities improvement, second, re establishing a national clearinghouse  to provide a variety of technical assist ance to State and local governments,  third, prison  industry enhancement,  and  fourth, making surplus Federal  property available to State and local  jurisdictions.  An  impressive cross section of the  Nation's top political and law enforce ment  leadership  have  testified  at  length before Senate Judiciary Sub committees on the need for a strong,  continuing  and  redirected  Federal  commitment to justice assistance. The  Federal Government must review  its  resolve to aid the States in attacking  the Nation's most serious problems such as violent repeat offenders-and  the crisis of our Nation's dangerously  overcrowded and deteriorating prisons  and jails. The legislation that I have  introduced  is  aimed  at  addressing  these and other critical crime prob lems threatening our Nation's safety  and welfare.  This Senator is well aware that the  war on crime is being waged behind a  battleline of dangerously overcrowded  and antiquated prisons and  jails.  In  1982, the National Governor's Associa tion called for  the Federal Govern ment to make its No.1 criminal justice  priority more assistance for the con struction of new prisons. The Attorney  General's Task  Force  on Violent  Crime recommended that Congress ap propriate $2 billion over 4 years  to  help  the States build prisons. Gov.  James Thompson, cochairman of that  task force, urged that most of the rec ommendations to combat violent crime  would be to no avail for a nation left  with no place to put violent offenders  ",1984

221,1055,1,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Mr. President, on  November 18, 1983, amendments were  agreed to by the House of Representa tives during debate on H.R. 2755, the  Federal Communications Commission  Authorization Act of 1983 and con curred in by the Senate <Public Law  98-214). These amendments were the  result of discussion between the mem bers of the Senate Committee on Com merce,  Science  and Transportation  and the House Energy and Commerce  Committee. In order to establish the  intention of the committees originat ing these amendments, I ask that the  attached explanation be  included  in  the RECORD at this point. An identical  statement was made in the House of  Representatives on January 24, 1984,  by Representative JoHN DINGELL and  his colleagues Representatives TIMO THY WIRTH and JAMES BROYHILL.  The material follows:  INDUSTRY CERTIFICATION OF TECHNICIANS IN  THE PRIVATE LAND MOBILE SERVICES AND  FIXED SERVICES  Section 10 of H.R. 2755 amends the Com munications Act of 1934 to allow the Com mission to endorse industry certification of  individuals to perform transmitter installa tion,  operation, maintenance,  and  repair  duties  in the private land mobile services  and fixed services, if such certification pro grams are conducted by groups that are rep resentative of users of those services, and  are not composed of Federal government  employees.  Background  Generally,  users  in  the Private Land  Mobile Services utilize communications as  an adjunct to their primary activities. Such  primary activities would  include business,  industrial,  land  transportation and public  safety functions, among the many possibili ties.  In addition, unlike other communication  services, the Private Land Mobile Services  make intensive use of a limited amount of  spectrum, often sharing allocations not only  with other private land mobile users, but  other services. Such  intensive sharing of  spectrum allocations makes technical com pliance with accepted standards of engineer ing a necessity.  At present, only a holder of a General Ra diotelephone Operator License may take re sponsibilty for installation, service or main tenance of transmitters in the Private Land  Mobile Services and Fixed Services. The  FCC has proposed elimination of this re quirement in General Docket 83-322. It is  an extension of  its earlier elimination of  commercial radio operator license require ments in the broadcast services in Docket  20817.  The Commission  reasoned  in Docket  20817 that in the instance of those engaged  in broadcast services, provision of such serv ices are the primary economic focus of their  activities, therefore, there is a commercial  incentive for qualified personnel to take re sponsibility for maintaining transmitters in  order to assure the success of the broadcast  enterprise. In contrast, in the private serv ices, typical private radio service users have  neither  the  technical background or  the  economic incentive to maintain their trans mitters themselves and must rely on third  parties.  Elimination of the Commission's require ment of a General Radio-telephone Opera tor License  to perform  installation, oper ation, maintenance and repair duties could  result in the possibility of unqualified indi viduals being made  responsible  for main taining key functions of licensed facilities.  Installation, servicing, and maintenance of  private  radio  transmitters by unqualified  technicians would result in diminished tech nical performance and increase the possibili ty of  interference with  other  spectrum  users. Therefore, it is in the public interest  to retain a uniform public  indicia of the  qualifications of those. individuals charged  with service, maintenance and installation  of private radio transmitters.  In recognition of the possibility that the  Commission may find it in the public inter est, convenience, and necessity to reduce the  administrative costs and burdens of continu ing to require Commission-licensed techni cians in the Private Land Mobile and Fixed  Services,  the Commission is authorized to  permit industry groups or committees to im plement a comparable substitute. An indus try-administered certification program, op erating under Commission supervision, and  subject to Commission authority, would pro vide  such  a  comparable  substitute. The  process of  industry certification  is  recog nized in a variety of other fields as reducing  the  regulatory burden upon  the govern ment, and benefiting members of the indus try through a self-regulation process. In this  respect, utilization by the FCC of frequency  advisory committees  in  the Private Land  Mobile Services to assist in the frequency  selection process  is an already recognized  and  successful  role which  industry  has  played in promoting the efficient operation  of these Private Radio Services.  We note that this provision may result in  cost savings for the Commission. The provi sion permits the FCC to rely upon the pri vate sector to aid in the technician certifica tion process, which would free the FCC to  direct  its resources elsewhere, and reduce  the  regulatory  impact upon  the private  radio users while maintaining qualification  standards upon which such users may rely.  AMATEUR RADIO LICENSE EXAMINATIONS  1934  Section 11 of H.R. 2755 amends section 4  of  the Communications Act  of  to  enable amateur  radio groups, when  they  prepare, process, or administer examina tions for amateur station operator licenses,  to recover out-of-pocket costs from examin ees. The total allowable cost per examinee  may not exceed $4.00, adjusted annually for  changes in the consumer price index. Ama teur radio groups must maintain records of  their out-of-pocket expenses,  and certify  them to the FCC.  Background  The issue of reimbursement of the volun teers' costs has arisen as a result of the Fed eral Communications Commission's imple mentation of Public Law 97-259. This law,  among other things, permits the Commis sion to use the uncompensated services of  volunteers to prepare and administer ama teur radio examinations. It permits transfer  of the amateur radio examination process,  in whole or in part, to the amateurs them selves. This results in three specific benefits.  First, there is a significant savings to the  Federal government in both costs and man power. Second, it solves the problem of in creasing unavailability of amateur examina tions in many areas of the country due to  Commission  budgetary  constraints. And  third, it allows for increasing the examina tion question data base at the least cost to  the Federal Government and  thereby de creases  the opportunity for applicants  to  pass the examination merely by memorizing  the questions and answers instead of acquir ing knowledge of the subject.  This provision is addressed solely to the  process of administering examinations for  the higher class amateur licenses. The Com mission has implemented the authority to  accept voluntary  uncompensated  services  from amateurs in such a way that volun teers may incur significant expense. Unlike  the regulatory scheme which the FCC ap plied to the novice examination procedure  <vol. 48 Federal Register pp. 45652-45661) to  govern examinations for the higher class li censes requires two levels of volunteers. The  first level, so-called volunteer examination  coordinators <VEC's> would deal directly  with the Commission and be responsible for  coordinating the examinations within their  assigned  area.  The  continental  United  States is divided  into 10  large areas, and  each VEC is required to oversee the exams  within his entire area.  Under the Commission rules, the exami nation questions would be selected in ad vance by the FCC from publicly available  lists. The VEC would have  to print  the  exam and distribute them to the local vol unteers. The  examination would  consist  solely of questions periodically selected by  the FCC and communicated to the coordina tor. After the examination is administered,  the results would be forwarded to the coor dinator for checking, then the papers sent  to the FCC for issuance of the appropriate  license.  The volunteers on the local level would be  responsible for actually administering  the  ",1984

At the  same time, acquiring abandoned build ings  from our school districts when  that  is  feasible  and can  serve  this  useful purpose will  also  give  those  school districts funds which they can  put  to good use  in  improving  their  educational programs.

224,1081,1,Mrs. SCHNEIDER.," Madam Chair man, I rise today in support of H.R.  2878,  the Library Services and Con struction Act  amendments. Though  the numbers are small when compared  to the whole budget, the benefits pro vided to every American are incalcula ble. Since  its  inception in 1957,  this  legislation has greatly contributed to  the expansion of  the public  library  system throughout our Nation.  Libraries have ceased being simply  places where books are kept. Over the  years they have become valuable com munity service centers, assisting Amer icans of all age groups. From personal  experience, I know that my State of  Rhode  Island and  its citizens have  benefited  immensely  from  this pro gram. Some of the activities supported  through  this Federal  assistance  in clude: Resource sharing between local  libraries-this concept prevents a du plication of efforts and resources and  assures that each dollar is spent with  maximum efficiency; a  regional out reach service for the blind and phys ically handicapped-last year  alone,  some 2,500 Rhode Islanders were as sisted through this program; and ma terial  and  programing  services  for  State  institutions,  among  them  the  adult correctional institution, various  veterans homes, and State hospitals. I  could go on, but the important fact  that I want to highlight is that our  public libraries have become an inter gral part of the lives of Americans and  this program assists  in meeting  the  needs of these various groups in our  population.  Once again,  I want to express my  support for this valuable program and  urge my colleagues to support a con tinuation of funding for this legisla tion. Thank you.e  e ",1984

Specifically,  the LSCA  amendments  will focus  the program on providing  access  to  library services  to a wide  range  of populations  including  the  handicapped,  elderly,  and  bilingual  populations; redirect the concept of li braries  from  being  repositories  for  books to being community information  centers providing a wide range of serv ices  to  the public; provide direct  li brary services  to  Indian  tribes  that  have formerly received no library serv ices; increase the emphasis on interli brary cooperation; expand and provide  increased funding for library construc tion and renovation purposes; and pro vide grants for libraries that wish to  provide literacy training programs or  foreign language materials.  Many  of  the  changes  that  are  brought about in the amendments to  LSCA are directly tied to the Nation's  economic, education, and employment  well-being. It is in the best interest of  the country to adopt this legislation so  that libraries can continue to function  to help communities throughout the  Nation.  As an example of how LSCA has  worked, let me tell you about the ex periences in my home State of Michi gan.  In Michigan, LSCA is helping librar ies to link together electronically and  share their resources,  thus effecting  economies,  extending  service,  and  making the most efficient use of ex pensive  library materials. Through  LSCA assistance with the initial hard ware required or the processing of cat aloging data, libraries are enabled to  participate through the Michigan li brary consortium in a nationwide bibli ographic data base, the Online Com puter Library Center <OCLC).  For  very small libraries this process may  be the first time they have profession al bibliographic control of their own  collections, plus it gives them access to  the holdings of many kinds of Michi gan libraries, and if needed, to count less other libraries across the country.  However, recent telecommunications  developments may raise  the cost of  the private phone line system linking  Michigan libraries to these computer ized data bases by 76 percent  this  April, according to the latest figures.  With such a drastic jump in costs so  imminent,  the  continued  support  through the library services and con struction act is essential. We should  not  hit  libraries  with  a  double  whammy; we should support the bill  before us, H.R. 2878. For the Upper  Peninsula of Michigan and for many  other sparsely populated  regions  in  the United States, telecommunications  is the only reasonable way to extend  adequate  library  service  to all  resi dents. But the libraries can not do it  alone, and if we expect them to coop erate across State lines, it is appropri ate  that we  assist  them  through  LSCA.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   e ",1984
226,1081,1,Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT.," Madam  Chairman, I  rise  in support of H.R.  2878,  the Library Services and Con struction Act <LSCA> Amendments of  1983. Knowing that library and infor mation services are experiencing rapid  expansion and change, I believe Feder al action  is necessary  to strengthen  and assist  local and statewide plan ning, coordinate present services for  maximum effectiveness, and meet the  needs of many sectors of our popula tion for new services and facilities.  As information services become the  focal point of our Nation's progress, li braries confront head on any obstacles  to generating awareness by providing a  readily available, free entrance to the  world of learning. The LSCA has bene fited the people of Arkansas immeas urably by, among other things, reach ing the elderly, handicapped, or shut ins with book mobile services; provid ing book deposits in local areas so that  those living in rural, mountainous ter rain do not have to travel into large  cities to obtain reading materials; pro viding assistance for serving the deaf;  and operating programs for functional  illiterates.  The services for senior centers and  the book deposits have proven very  popular in my own district, which is  one of the Nation's favorite retirement  spots.  Individuals who  have  spent  their lives  in the educational arena,  and have then contributed to society  with the benefits of their education,  greatly appreciate the outreach pro grams of the LSCA.  longtime supporter of library  services,  I  particularly  favor  the  LSCA's matching approach, which in vokes cooperation from both the Fed eral and State levels. The authoriza tion levels provided for in H.R. 2878  are urgently needed to meet current  and future needs for information shar ing.  The threatening effects of illiteracy  to  our  nation's  rapidly  expanding  technology is a problem which must  be dealt with. The LSCA is a worth while program with the very worthy  goals of eradicating illiteracy and as suring everyone's ""right to read.""e  e ",1984

230,1107,1,Mr. WRIGHT.," CLEM  ZABLOCKI  al ready was an established and respect ed Member of Congress when I came  here in 1955. Quiet, unprepossessing,  he made a mark. CLEM ZABLOCKI was  universally respected by all of his col leagues on both sides of the aisle. He  was  a  consummate  gentleman,  an  American's American,  a  lawmaker's  lawmaker.  I  think CLEM ZABLOCKI  in his quiet  way probably did more to make a re ality of the dream of bipartisanship in  foreign policy than almost anyone else  in that position might have done. He  was  confronted by difficult circum stances as he rose to the position of  chairmanship in the important Com mittee on Foreign Affairs. His carreer  spans  difficulties,  alarms,  changing  circumstances, crises of one kind and  another in almost every part of the  world. Through it all he never lost his  equanimity. Through it all he never  lost his sense of respect for his col leagues  of  whatever  persuasion.  Through it all, rather than a lighten ing rod, CLEM ZABLOCKI seemed to be  the kind of repository to which others  could  come with  their hot molten  metal of ideas and clashing opinions  and they could cool them off in the  quiet recesses of his mind and his per sonality.  CLEM  ZABLOCKI Was  able  to make  people  of  disparate  and  divergent  viewpoints  come  together  upon  a  workable formula. We will miss him  sorely. He was one of those public offi cials not given  to seeking publicity.  Rarely was his name and visage embla zoned across the front pages of the  newspapers of America. Seldom did he  crowd out the evening news on televi sion. Never did he seek consciously to  be the center of attention. But he was  the center and the focal point around  which the foreign policy issues of the  House devolved.  He performed  a  service  that has  been little noted. I am not sure that  history will  record  the  significant  unsung  service  that was performed  throughout these years by CLEMENT J.  ZABLOCKI. To know him was to be en riched. To serve with him was to have  a gift for which we will always be  grateful.  ",1984

Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to  recognize our colleague, the gentleman  from Wisconsin <Mr. RoTH), who not  only knew CLEM as the chairman of  our State delegation, but also as chair man of the committee to which he was  assigned in Congress.  ",1984
232,1107,1,Mr. ROTH.," I thank my colleague for  yielding.  Mr. Speaker,  I want to thank our  colleague, the gentleman from Wiscon sin (Mr. KASTENMEIER), for his appro priate remarks and for asking for this  special order.  Mr. Speaker, when I learned of the  sudden  and  tragic  circumstances  which  struck  down  Congressman  CLEMENT ZABLOCKI,  I knew  that our  home State of Wisconsin had lost the  senior and most distinguished Member  of  its congressional delegation. The  country  lost an able  individual who  was chairman of the House Committee  on Foreign Affairs and on so very  many occasions faithfully represented  the best interest of the United States  to leaders around the world.  I felt a certain kinship to Congress man ZABLOCKI. Both he and I served  on  the Foreign Affairs Committee.  Many times both he and I had similar  views on international events. Both he  and I were alumni of Marquette Uni versity in Milwaukee.  the  Those of us who had the privilege to  serve with him understand the diffi cult and complex task which he so art fully performed. How many times was  our former chairman asked to mediate  a dispute between other ranking mem bers of our committee or to settle a  matter of legislative jurisdiction. How  many time did Congressman ZABLOCKI  place his loyalty to his country and his  President over partisan politics and  the course of political expediency?  These were  the marks of a great  chairman-a chairman who sought to  deal fairly with all the members of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs wheth er they be Democrat or Republican.  I know that many people in Wiscon sin felt a personal loss with his pass ing. They remember him because he  never forgot his roots and maintained  a fierce loyalty to protect the interests  of his constituents. We all can appreci ate and can participate in the great  issues of  the day-national security,  foreign  policy,  international  trade,  human rights, world hunger, and the  many other special problems which af flict each region of our world.  Congressman ZABLOCKI was part of  all of these issues. Either directly, or  indirectly  through his subcommittee  chairman, he played a role in world af fairs.  But the Congressman never forgot  his constituents. He never forgot the  elderly who needed heat in the winter,  the lost social security check, the par ents of a would be student who needed  help in the Washington bureaucracy  to find the right office to apply for a  student loan.  It  is  impossible  to  estimate how  many people  in Wisconsin benefited  from Congressman  ZABLOCKI  repre senting them in the U.S. Congress. On  this  score  alone  he was  a  great  Member of this body.  But his abilities and special gifts car ried him to greater heights. The coun try is grateful and so are we that his  even hand helped guide the ship of  state.  Many  centuries  ago,  Ecclesiastes  wrote about a time for war and a time  for peace, a  time for reaping and a  time  for  sowing. Congressman  ZA BLOCKI's time came when we all wished  he could have remained with us. His  memory will be blessed.  0 1620  The country lost an able individual  who was the chairman of our Commit tee on Foreign Affairs, and on so many  occasions  faithfully  represented  the  best interests of the United States not  only here on the floor but also around  the floor.

We could also rely upon him  as  expressing his  sincere,  heartfelt  feeling  on  every measure  that he  brought to the floor.

I  thoroughly  enjoyed his  company  and was  im pressed by his leadership at the meet ings.  Chairman ZABLOCKI presided over a  Foreign  Affairs  Committee  that  passed  landmark legislation-the nu clear freeze resolution in 1983. In 1973,  he was a leader in the successful fight  to pass the War Powers Act.  CLEM ZABLOCKI  learned the lessons  he taught as a civics teacher and en tered politics 45 years ago. Through out his career he was a staunch sup porter of working people, compiling  one of  the highest pro-labor voting  records in the Congress.  I will miss CLEM ZABLOCKI.

He spent his time mastering  those details, particularly in the area  of foreign policy, and in providing day to-day help to his constituents. He was  a devoted and hard-working Member  of Congress who sought no notoriety  or acclaim for the work he did. He was  a deeply religious man who was able to  apply the principles of his religious be liefs to issues of public policy without  being parochial.  I will remember him best from our  service  together on  the Foreign Af fairs Committee. As one of his sub committee chairmen,  I was grateful  both for the wide latitude and ample  responsibility he accorded subcommit tees, and for the help he was always  ready and willing to give even when  the views of a subcommittee or the  committee  itself might not coincide  precisely with his own.

241,1146,1,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er, during the last session, serious alle gations were made of improper alter ations of an amendment to H.R. 2461,  the Rehabilitation Act Amendments  of 1983. This amendment was adopted  in legislative session of the Committee  on Education and Labor, and the ma jority party and its staff were accused  of having made  the  improper alter ations.  The Committee on Standards of Of ficial Conduct carried out a thorough  investigation of this and other allega tions of improper alterations of House  documents.  In  its  comprehensive  report, ""Investigation of Alleged Im proper Alterations  of House Docu ments,"" the Committee on Education  and Labor was exonerated. Since the  unfounded charges against the Com mittee on Education and Labor were  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  widely and publicly circulated at the  time they were made, I think it appro priate to include  in my remarks the  full  text of the findings and conclu sions of the Committee on Standards  of Official Conduct from its report:  A. APRIL 20, 1983, LEGISLATIVE ACTION BY  THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR  On July 12, 1983, Representative John Erlenbom testified before the Committee on  Rules  that  in his  judgment, ""a 67-word  amendment     grew to 386 words between  the time it was ordered reported from the  Education and Labor Committee and  the  time it was printed."" <See Cong. Rec., daily  ed., July 19, 1983, H 5242.>  The  situation precipitating Representa tive Erlenbom's remarks and his allegation  of improper alteration are set forth below.  On April 20, 1983, the Committee on Edu cation and Labor considered H.R. 2461, the  Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1983.  During' the markup session, the Committee  Chairman, Representative Carl Perkins, of fered an amendment affecting certain pro gram authorizations. His amendment was  intended to increase particular program au thorizations to the target levels contained in  the first budget resolution for fiscal year  1984 <H. Con. Res. 91>  as passed by  the  House. A chart entitled, ""Comparison of the  Authorization Ceilings Contained  in  the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981  for fiscal year 1984 with The Assumptions  in The First Budget Resolution As Passed  By The House,"" was provided to every com mittee Member during the consideration of  the amendment. 6 The Chart identified nine  programs having a higher figure under the  budget resolution than under the ceiling es tablished by the 1981 Reconciliation Act. 7  The Perkins amendment stated:  SEc. 110. <a> There are authorized to be ap propriated for any program under the juris diction of the Committee on Education and  Labor such funding levels as are assumed  under the first budget resolution <H. Con.  Res. 91> for fiscal year 1984.  <b> The authorizations of appropriations  under subsection <a> of this section super cede, and are not in addition to, authoriza tions, under the Omnibus Budget Reconcili ation Act of 1981 <Public Law 97-35).""  Regarding Representative Erlenbom's al legation, the Committee obtained a copy of  a portion of the transcript of the April 20,  1983, markup of H.R. 2461. The following  discussion took place:  ",1984

B,  the Authorization of appropriations  under Subsection A of this Section super cede and are not in addition to authoriza tions under the Omnibus Budget Reconcilia tion Act of 1981, Public Law 97-35.  Now, what this does The Committee points out  that, despite  the  clear intent of the amendment, H. Con. Res. 91  does not contain specific program authorizations.

But the  authorization  levels  of  every  program  within the jurisdiction of this committee.  Now, might I  just suggest that if this, its  obvious purposeMr. PERKINs. It only affects, let me say to  the gentleman, nine programs where we  have jurisdiction over some 40 or 50 here.  ",1984
254,1146,1,Mr. ERLENBORN.," Well, let me say that its  obvious purpose is not to lower authoriza tions but, rather, to increase them ....  The Committee's understanding of  the  above-quoted portions of the April 20, 1983,  markup  session  is  that Representative  Murphy  clearly  stated  that  the Perkins  amendment affected <by way of  increase>  the authorization on only nine prograins,  not every program within the Committee on  Education and Labor's jurisdiction, as Rep resentative Erlenbom  had  argued.

256,1172,1,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  joining with HAL SAWYER, the ranking  Republican on the Subcommittee on  Crime, to introduce today the Danger ous Drug Diversion Control Act of  1984.  This  bill  is  the  administration's  package of substantive and technical  changes in the Controlled Substances  Act  and  the Controlled Substances  Import and Export Act which affect  the way  that potentially dangerous  prescription drugs are handled and  distributed by manufacturers, distribu tors, pharmacists, and physicians.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Last summer, the Subcommittee on  Crime examined the very large prob lem of the abuse of dangerous pre scription  drugs.  In  1982,  close  to  100,000 Americans of all ages went to  hospital emergency rooms because of  their reaction to controlled substances  of this type, which are only lawfully  obtained by a  doctor's prescription.  That number was  just about  three  times the number of people who went  to emergency rooms because of heroin,  cocaine, marihuana, and LSD. Accord ing to the Federal Government's drug  abuse warning network, 75 percent of  the drugs identified in drug abuse re lated deaths reported by various medi cal examiners were prescription drugs.  Abuse of  these drugs, obtained and  used outside the scope of responsible  medical treatment, is the most devas tating and widespread aspect of the  drug abuse epidemic.  These potentially dangerous drugs  are abused because the system of legal  controls for them is circumvented in a  variety of ways. It was made clear at  that hearing that improvements in the  existing system of legal controls are  called for.  The bill which we are  introducing  was drafted by the administration and  transmitted to Congress in 1983 by the  President as part of a very large pack age of  suggested criminal  law  revi sions. We are concerned about  the  problem of  the diversion  of  these  drugs, and therefore we are introduc ing the President's ""Diversion Control  Amendments""  in order  to allow  fo cused public and congressional consid eration of this part of the administra tion's package of suggested  improve ments.  We did not develop  these amend ments, and we are not at this time en dorsing or passing  judgment on any  particular provisions in this bill. Our  purpose is to place before the House  these proposals to address drug diver sion problems which the administra tion has  identified. These proposals  were favorably reported by the Senate  Judiciary Committee on July 21, 1983,  as part B of title V of S. 1762.  The bill  that we  are  introducing  today is what the President submitted  and the Senate Judiciary Committee  has reported except for the correction  of obvious typographical errors, draft ing errors, and inadvertent omissions  of a strictly technical nature.  The subcommittee has scheduled its  first hearing on  this  legislation  for  February 22, 1984. We look forward to  hearing  from  the public,  from  the  health care and pharmaceutical indus tries, from the law enforcement com munity, and  from specialists  in  the  problems of drug abuse for their comments and  suggestions. As  the evi dence that I cited earlier makes plain,  this is a major component of the crisis  of drug abuse our society is now con fronting. We are going to examine, iniJanuary 31, 1984  tially in the context of the changes  that the administration has proposed,  all of the issues in the system of legal  control of prescription drugs that are  subject to abuse, and proposals for im provement.  Those who wish  to participate  in  these hearings should contact counsel  Eric Sterling, Subcommittee on Crime,  207 Cannon House Office Building,  Washington, D.C. 20515, <202)  2251695.  I ask unanimous consent that at this  point in the REcoRD,  I may insert a  brief description of the provisions.  SECTION-BY -SECTION ANALYSIS  Section 1 is the short title, the ""Danger ous Drug Diversion Control Act of 1984.""  Subsection  <b>  explains  that  sections  2  through 13 are amendments  to  the Con trolled Substances Act  and  sections  14  through  22  amend  the Controlled Sub stances Import and Export Act.  Section 2 adds a definition of the term  ""isomer"" and amends the definition of the  term ""narcotic drug"".  Section 3 grants to the Attorney General  the authority  to  schedule or  reschedule  drugs on an emergency basis. This would  provide a headstart on the procedure now  used  to  schedule  controlled  substances  which frequently takes up to a year.  Section 4 expands the authority of the At torney General  to exempt  from  control  compounds, mixtures or preparations  in  three categories: exempt over-the-counter  preparations, exempt prescription prepara tions, and exempt chemical preparations.  Section 5 modifies the length of time for  which a  registration for a practitioner  is  valid. Currently all registrations must be re newed  annually. This amendment would  allow the Attorney General to issue regis trations for up to 3 years for practitioners.  In 1979 DEA estimated that this change  could save $700,000 annually.  Section 6 amends the requirements of reg istering practitioners who dispense or con duct research  in controlled substances  to  allow the Attorney General to deny a regis tration on broader, public interest grounds  than currently allowed, and provides five  factors  to be weighed  in determining the  public  interest.  this bill also  includes the  last sentence of subsection <f> which was in advertently omitted in the President's sub mission and was not included in S. 1762.  Section 7 is an amendment similar to that  in section 6 which allows the Attorney Gen eral to suspend or revoke a registration to  manufacture, distribute or dispense upon a  finding that the registrant has committed  acts which would render the registration in consistent with the public  interest as de fined in section 303<f> <21 U.S.C. 823<f» as  amended in section 6 of this bill.  Section 8 is intended to give the Attorney  General the authority to take custody of  controlled substances  in circumstances  which a registrant ceases practice or goes  out of business, or of the controlled sub stances of a registrant for which the regis trant's registration has expired.  Sections 9 and 10 together rewrite the rec ord.keeping  exemptions  for  practitioners  who administer or prescribe controlled sub in  stances in the lawful course of their practice  in section 307<c><l> <A> and <B> <21 U.S.C.  827<c><l> <A> and <B». Clause <A> currently  applies to the prescribing or administering  of narcotic controlled substances. Section 9  ",1984
257,1198,1,Mr. WALGREN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of  H.R. 2465 the significant earthquakes  that hit in south-central Idaho on Oc tober 28 killing 2 children and in Coa linga, Calif. on May 2, and the memo ries of over 6,000 people who died in  fires last year make the case for strong  national programs to reduce the haz ards associated with earthquakes and  fires. This bill seeks  to maintain an  adequate earthquake prediction pro gram and enhance  the Federal  fire  prevention and control effort.  Title I authorizes appropriations for  the national earthquake hazards  re duction program. For fiscal year 1984,  this bill authorizes $3.705 million  to  the Federal Emergency Management  Agency <FEMA>  for a number of ac tivities including planning and coordi nation, improvement of seismic codes,  to promote hazard awareness among  State and local governments, and dis seminate information; $35.524 million  to the U.S. Geological Survey <USGS>  for earthquake hazards and risk as sessment,  earthquake  prediction,  global seismology, and the operation  of seismic engineering programs; $27.3  million to the National Science Foun dation <NSF) to conduct fundamental  studies, earthquake engineering, and  policy research; and $475,000  to the  Center  for Building Technology, at  the National Bureau  of Standards  <NBS) to conduct research and devel op standards in the seismic design and  construction of buildings. For  fiscal  year 1985, each authorization level is  increased by 5 percent.  For  the earthquake program,  the  total authorization level for fiscal year  1984  is $67,004,000  this amount will  provide sufficient funds  to  the U.S.  Geological Survey for prediction and  monitoring of  the San Andreas and  other  faults  and  to  the National  Bureau of Standards to reinstate the  seismic codes and standards effort at  the Center for Building Technology.  Under this bill, we will maintain the  current  level of  research on earth quakes and the current level of moni toring networks.  The bill authorizes $475,000 to rein state the seismic standards effort at  the Center for Building Technology at  the National Bureau of Standards.  The committee disagreed with the ad ministration's proposal  to  eliminate  the CBT in the fiscal year 1984 budget  request.  The Center  for  Building  Technology is the only Federal organi zation with expertise on earthquake  engineering required for improvement  of  seismic  design  and  construction  practices.  The U.S. investment in construction  is at a rate of $230 billion per year,  with better than half of that in seis mic regions. A report by the National  Research council ""Earthquake Engi neering Research-1982"" Termed the  present U.S.  effort  in  earthquake  hazard  reduction ""inadequate."" Esti mates have been made that 3,000  to  23,000  fatalities will occur when the  next  catastrophic  earthquake  hits  California. Most of the deaths and in juries would occur because of the fail ure of manmade structures.  The Coalinga earthquake is real evi dence of the need for improvement in  seismic design and construction prac tices. Estimates of  total damage  in  Coalinga have been placed at $30 mil lion. All of the 2,500 homes  in the  town were damaged  to some degree  and 5 percent were left uninhabitable.  On the other hand, the strong quake  that rocked Idaho October 28, 1983,  caused no major structural damage to  recently  constructed  buildings  in  major cities. These buildings were con structed to withstand a seismic event.  However,  some older buildings near  the earthquake epicenter were crip pled. Two children were killed in Chal lis, a town near the epicenter, when a  storefront collapsed on them.  The Federal Government clearly has  an  important role  in sponsoring  re search  and  development  to  reduce  earthquake losses.  Title  11  authorizes  appropriations  for  the Federal  fire prevention and  control program. The total authoriza tion level  in this bill for fiscal year  1984 is $17,720,000 to FEMA to carry  out the programs at the U.S. Fire Ad ministration  <USFA>  and National  Fire Academy. For fiscal year 1984,  this total is $3 million above the ad ministration's request. The $3 million  increase  includes $1 million  to U.S.  Fire Administration  to enhance  fire  prevention education programs at the  State and  local  level for  individuals  who are particularly vulnerable to fire  hazards-the  elderly,  handicapped,  and minorities. Also, $1 million to U.S.  Fire Administration to promote tech nology  development  programs-such  activities as  low cost residential  fire  prevention systems; and methods of  testing fire alarms and fire protection  devices without interruption everyone  in the process; and $1 million to the  National Fire Academy to improve in formation exchange through satellite  and regional dissemination efforts.  The committee found a critical need  to improve public education programs  and to disseminate information to the  fire service community. Title 2 of this  bill seeks to do this and maintain cur rent fire prevention and control pro gram activities at the U.S. Fire Admin istration and National Fire Academy.  For fiscal year 1985, the authorization  level is increased by 5 percent.  The full magnitude of our national  fire  problem  is  difficult  to  grasp.  Annual deaths due to fire are roughly  equal to having two jumbo jets crash  in midair every month. Fire mostly  kills people in one's and two's in their  homes-this is  less newsworthy, even  though  the annual death  total  (ap proximately 8,000) is nearly 20  times  that  of  tornadoes,  hurricanes,  and  floods combined. Twenty-four people  each day die in fires. The flames are  not the principal killer-inhalation of  deadly  smoke and gas  accounts  for  more than 80 percent of all fire fatali ties. This is an alarming epidemic.  Mr. Chairman, we believe that the  programs authorized in this bill are ef fective  investments  in  preventing  greater life and property losses that  will happen if we fail to make these in vestments now. We realize that this is  a  tight budget year, but given  the  threat to  life and property and  the  very real potential to mitigate the dis asters, we urge favorable consideration  and passage of H.R. 2465.

258,1211,1,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, on Janu ary 22,  1918,  the Ukrainian people  threw off the yoke of repression and  declared their independence. This for mation of the Ukrainian National Re public 66 years ago signified an impor tant step in the history of the Ukraini an people as  they have struggled to  assert their identity and their beliefs  while  under  foreign  domination.  I  would like to join with my colleagues,  DON RITTER, SAM STRATTON, and WIL LIAM  BROOMFIELD,  in  their  special  order to bring this memorable date to  the attention of the Congress.  Though 66 years have passed since  this declaration, the memory of this  day still lives on in the hearts of all  Ukrainians. Out of the ashes of the  Russian  and Austro-Hungarian Em pires,  the Ukrainian people  rose  in  1918 and took the opportunity to real ize the dreams of their forefathers in  declaring  their  independence. From  the first, the new nation struggled to  hold on to its new-found freedom, bat tered by Russian armies from the East  and Polish armies from the West. De spite a valiant effort,  the Ukrainian  National Republic was crushed by the  Communist Russians in the summer of  1920, 3 years after its formation.  The Ukrainian people have suffered  66 years of repression and persecution  at the hands of Soviet aggressors since  their  declaration  of  independence.  They have been imprisoned and tor tured because of their political and re ligious beliefs and the doors of their  churches  and  schools  have  been  closed. Furthermore, an unwarranted  attempt was made by the Soviets to  eradicate an entire culture and race.  During 1932 and 1933, 7 to 10 million  Ukrainians starved to death because of  Stalin's cruel collectivization program  which  resulted  in  a  devastating  famine. The causes and effects of this  famine are still not fully known be cause  the Soviet Governme.nt  sup pressed  any  information  about  the  famine. Because this famine formed a  crucial chapter in the history of the  Ukrainian people and in an effort to  help Ukrainians throughout the world  regain a part of their past, I have in troduced legislation, H.R. 4459, which  would establish a congressional com mission to study the Ukraine famine  of 1932-33. Since H.R. 4459 was intro duced,  60  of  our  colleagues  have  deemed  this effort worthy of  their  support and have agreed to cosponsor  the measure. I urge the rest of my col leagues to support this bill as well and  to work with me in securing passage of  this bill.  Despite famines and persecution, de spite the curtailment of their civil lib erties, and despite the injustices that  they  have  been  subjected  to,  the  Ukrainian people continue to display  courage and perseverance and have  not yet given up hope that, one day,  they too will breathe the air of free dom. We must continue to remember  this momentous  declaration  in  the  hope  that our remembrance of  this  glorious moment will lend the Ukraini an people  the  encouragement  that  they need. As the famous Ukrainian  poet Taras Schevchenko  said,  ""Our  souls will never perish, freedom knows  no dying."" May the hope for freedom  for the Ukrainian people never die and  may their quest for independence be  successful.e  e ",1984
259,1211,1,Mr.  SENSENBRENNER.,"  Mr.  Speaker, today we, the U.S. Congress,  the representatives of a nation free  and strong, commemorate the 66th an niversary of Ukrainian independence.  Freedom in the Ukraine  is not out wardly visible. As a nation, it is under  Communist  control  by  the  Soviet  Union. Though the luxury of freedom  is not visibly evident in the Ukraine  today, freedom is present in the heart  of all Ukrainians. Worldwide, Ukraini ans who  fled persecution and  those  who brave daily terror in their home land,  all carry  the  freedom of  the  Ukrainian Republic as a torch to light  the path of  truth for a  suppressed  homeland.  The  atrocities  brought  against this nation by the Soviets has  not quelled the drive for freedom of  the Ukrainian people. We as Members  of the U.S. Congress, as well as all  Americans and all  free nations pay  tribute to the tenacious perseverance  that carries the Ukrainian people for ward through their adverse condition.  As all free people across  the globe  wish the Ukrainian people freedom as  a nation, may we also learn from these  people the true freedom they hold so  dear, freedom of the heart.e  e ",1984
260,1211,1,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, I  wish to extend my thanks to Congress man RITTER  for his  fine efforts  in  making  this commemoration of  the  66th Anniversary of the Ukraine's in dependence possible.  I am honored to have the opportuni ty  to  pay  special  tribute  to  the  Ukraine  and  the aspirations of  its  people on this important occasion.  Because of its strategic geographical  position  and  rich  resources,  the  Ukraine has always been regarded as a  coveted prize of aggressors from the  Mongols to the Moscovite czars and,  more  recently,  the Soviet Govern ment.  With the 1917 disintegration of the  Russian autocratic government, and  the Ukrainian  declaration  of  inde pendence, the Ukrainians demonstrat ed to the world that Moscow and Kiev  represented two different nations and  two different mentalities. Kiev repre sented the democratic concept of gov ernment  based  on  the  respect  of  human  rights, while Moscow  repre sented totalitarianism and destruction.  After the Ukrainian declaration of  independence,  they  fought valiantly  but unsuccessfully to keep their inde pendence for four terrible years. Since  the occupation of the Ukraine by the  Soviet Government, over 10 million  Ukrainians have died in the defense of  their country.  Today, we pause to pay special trib ute to the brave men and women of  the Ukrainewho are carrying forward.  ",1984
261,1224,1,Mr. MOLINARI.," I thank the gentle man from New York, <Mr. WEISS), for  yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to join my  colleagues in this bipartisan effort to  request  the  emergency  aid  for  the  people who are dying throughout the  world, particularly in Africa.  Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentle man <Mr. WEISS) for bringing on this  special order because time is running  out and I think it is important that we  do seek to get a concentration of the  Congress on  this very, very urgent  issue. I believe it is our moral obliga tion to do all that we possibly can in  order to alleviate the great suffering  being endured on  the continent of  Africa. The  latest supplemental  re quest  is part of a  series of actions  taken by the administration to address  this critical problem and I applaud the  decision  announced Monday  to  in crease assistance.  The famine in Afr""ica  is a result of  drought whic.h began in 1982 and con tinues to seriously affect food produc tion. The problem is intensified when  combined with a lack of favorable gov ernment agricultural policies, an  in ability to cover food deficits by com mercial imports as a result of a dete rioration of their balance of payments,  and the prevalence of animal disease.  Civil strife inhibits food aid distribu tion and encourages the migration of  refugees,  thereby placing more of a  strain on the governments of the af fected nations.  It is my belief that the United States  is  trying to respond both effectively  and efficiently to this crisis. I had the  opportunity of witnessing  this  first hand when I attended the Food and  Agriculture Organization Conference  held in November of last year. The Af rican crisis was one of the dominant  issues of the Conference and I  think  all 156 countries in attendance realized  the critical importance of addressing  this problem. Secretary Block, as head  of the U.S. delegation, reinforced our  aid commitment by announcing that  the United States was pledging $25  million in direct emergency food aid.  The announced increase was in addi tion to a previous $25 million increase  in  emergency  food  aid  for Africa,  which brought  the amount of  total  food and agricultural aid to the conti nent  to $550 million for 1983. Once  back home, I was pleased to hear of  the  January  announcement by  the  Agency for International Development  that $32.7 million  in new funds was  being allocated for the African crisis.  Finally, as you know, on Monday Sec retary Shultz announced a request for  an  emergency  appropriation of $90  million which would allow for 200,000  metric tons of food aid.  In my contact with AID during the  past 2 months, officials freely acknowleged that more emergency aid would  be necessary based on their actual and  projected requests from African coun tries for food aid. It is evident that, in  terms of  this situation, our Govern ment has a consistent pattern of in creasing aid as the facts warrant. I en courage the administration to contin ue to be receptive to future needs.  Mr. Speaker, I think it important to  note  another  announcement which  was made Monday by Secretary Shultz  aimed at addressing  long-term solu tions to the hunger of Africa. I was en couraged to hear of the proposed in centive program which would award  governments willing to alter their poli cies in favor of agricultural programs.  Only through these types of programs  will we be able to insure that a repeat  of this crisis does not occur. This pro posed program deserves our careful at tention in the coming months.  Each day we hear stories of personal  human suffering with very little hope  of  imminent  relief. Certainly,  facts  now warrant that this Congress seri ously study a supplemental appropria tion for Africa.  I have been  told  if  emergency  requests are not met by  April or May, it may be too late. It is  our responsibility to quickly and favor ably enact a supplemental appropria tion.  I would like to add at this point that  it might be appropriate  that  today  when we have heard so much discus sion about budget deficits and there  has been such great emphasis on both  sides of the aisle  today in attacking  the budget deficits that this country  has been known as a country with a  big heart and although we may have  problems in dealing with the deficits  that we have in this country, we will  not close our hearts and our minds to  the problems of the truly needy, par ticularly  those  starving  and  dying  throughout the world.  I thank the gentleman for bringing  on the special order and for allowing  me to participate in this very humani tarian effort.  ",1984
262,1224,1,Mr. WEISS.,"  I  thank my  distin guished friend from New York for his  very important contribution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle man from Texas <Mr. LELAND).  I  thank  the gentle man from New York <Mr. WEISS) for  allowing me to share a little bit with  him this time on this very, very impor tant issue.  The gentleman and I had the privi lege of going to Africa in August and  saw some incredible things as far as  the starvation problem there. We were  in Africa for 21 days. It was a most in valuable experience as far as  I was  concerned.  I thank the gentleman for providing  this time and providing the American  people with an opportunity  to learn  more about what  this  is all about.  Each year 15 to 20 million people die  ",1984
263,1224,1,Mr. LELAND.,"  worldwide as a result of hunger and  malnutrition. That is 40,000 people a  day, 28 every minute. Of the 28 who  will die in the next 60 seconds, 21 will  be children.  Nowhere is the situation more devas tating than in Africa. Estimating that  150 million Africans are chronically  hungry,  the United Nations warns  that 24  impoverished African nations  face severe food shortages this year  where drought, civil war, and blights  have exacerbated already overwhelm ing circumstances. In late 1983, Minis ters from eight Sahel countries met  with donor countries and international  institutions and agreed that corrective  action since 1976 has been insufficient;  and the once treasured goal of achiev ing food self-sufficiency has become  an unrealistic objective for the fore seeable future. Of the 26 specifically  designated poorest countries  in  the  world, 24 are in Africa.  While in Africa last summer, I was  taken to one of the many feeding sta tions  in Ethiopia where  emergency  food rations are distributed. I cannot  even begin to describe the deprivation,  pain, and hopelessness I saw  in the  eyes of the people frantically clustered  around the station hoping for the mir acle of food. Tragically, much of the  seed for next year's plantings has even  been eaten out of desperation. It is es timated that 75 to 100 people, mostly  children, die each day  in Ethiopia.  Three million  people  are  currently  threatened by starvation. The knowl edge of global tragedy of hunger was  made disturbingly vivid  for me as I  looked  at  those  sick  and  forlorn  people. A lengthy, grueling civil war  has taken its toll on the population,  and can  take  responsibility  for  the  bogged down efforts by relief organiza tions to distribute food, medicine, and  agricultural supplies through increas ingly  perilous,  almost  nonexistent  transportation routes.  Much of Africa  is  facing  unsur mountable  problems, making  their  escape from  the poverty cycle seem  elusive  at  best.  Shrinking  revenue  bases,  limited  resources, declines  in  cultivatable land, unchanging climatic  conditions, and, considerable economic  sacrifices have resulted in many coun tries' efforts  to eliminate  their bal ance-of-payments deficits. Even with a  sudden surge of aid dollars, most Afri can nations are unlikely  to  recover  from  the  staggering conditions  fos tered by the severest drought  in 10  years. While starvation is obviously no  stranger to the people of Mozambique,  Ghana, Ethiopia, and Mauritania,  it  would appear to me, Mr. Speaker, that  the United States  should officially  urge that immediate steps be taken by  international  agencies  to  determine  comprehensively the populations now  facing, or will  imminently be facing  outright starvation.  ",1984
264,1237,1,Mr. LELAND.," Mr. Speaker, let me  introduce  you  to  an  extraordinary  human being. Her name  is Sophia  Bender. She resides in Houston, Tex.,  and in the hearts of all who know her.  An incredible purveyor of compassion,  she works  tirelessly for  the good of  humanity.  While her seal is stamped indelibly  on  the struggles  for  justice  for op pressed Jewry all over the world, her  efforts extend far beyond Jewry  to  less  fortunate peoples everywhere.  I  know her personally and commend her  to you my colleagues as an example of  leadership in quest for peace and jus tice in our troubled world.  Let me submit for  the RECORD an  editorial comment  from  the  Jewish  Herald-Voice  for your consideration  about Ms. Bender.  [From the Jewish Herald-Voice]  IN  APPRECIATION  OF  SOPHIA  BENDER-AN  ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN MOLDING A BETTER  TOMORROW  At a  time when many  journalists begin  the new year of 1984 with a great deal of  pessimism and a sense of futility, we are re minded of Samuel Johnson's famous com ment that ""The future is purchased by the  present.""  It is a sad commentary about our times  that so few today choose to take an active  role in the molding of our tomorrow. Sophia  Bender does. This editorial is our reflection  of our collective appreciation both for the  accomplishments of Sophia Bender as ADL  chairperson and of her general willingness  to devote part of her life to ""purchasing the  future."" Responsibility  toward community  and society is a driving force in her life. She  is not a passive victim of events, but an  active participant in their development.  In the history of Houston Jewry during  1983, Sophia Bender was a major player. As  ADL chairperson, she  infused  the agency  with dynamism and action. When the Klan  raised its ugly head, and it did so often this  past year, it felt the presence of the ADL.  In our corner of  the world, Nicaraguan,  Soviet and Ethiopian Jewry were not forgot ten. When  problems  of  anti-Semitism  emerged  in Mexico, a delegation of ADL  leaders from Houston crossed the border to  investigate and lend support.  Translating Israel's position in the face of  speeches, publications, seminars and sympo siums constituted an effective and meaning ful response. Seldom a day went by when in formation was not coming out of the ADL  office clarifying old  ideas and generating  new thought.  Robert Kennedy once said, ""Some men  see  things as  they are and say  'why?' I  dream things that never were, and say 'why  not?' "" This quotation speaks directly to So phia's approach to both ADL and life. The  dream  is but  the first stage, and Sophia  Bender  is  unique because  she not only  dreams, but she never fails  to turn those  dreams into actions.  The definition of leadership is to set an  agenda, and then to have others join in the  pursuit of that agenda. Sophia's organiza tional skills, her tenacity and her obvious  caring and affection have brought friends to  the ADL agenda. There is a link, not only  between the present and the future, but be tween the present and the past, as well.  Sophia Bender has learned the lessons of  the past. She knows  the significance and  impact of the Jewish experience. She not  only relates it to the future, but acts upon it  in the present. She is, as Homer said of  ffiysses-""What  he  greatly  thought,  he  nobly dared.""  TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR  COLUMBUS ""A. C."" PICKENS  ",1984

283,1302,1,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Nebraska.  ,1984
284,1302,1,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I would  like  to pose a question on my  time,  again, and  request  the answer from  the Senator  from Maryland,  if he  would be so helpful.  As  the  Senator  from Maryland  knows full well, the Senator from Ne braska has no opposition whatsoever  to what he is attempting to do, basical ly,  in setting up an organization for  the celebration of the SOOth anniversa ry of  the discovery of America by  Christopher Columbus.  The Senator from Nebraska, howev er, is concerned about the reported $2  million over a period of years  that  would be appropriated, beginning with  the measure before us.  I  simply  in quire at this time from  the Senator  from Maryland: Should  the  legisla tion, as amended, become law, does the  proposal before us still include the be ginning appropriation of a total of $2  million over the next several years for  the purpose stated?  ",1984
285,1302,1,Mr. MATHIAS.," The bill does provide  for  the necessary  expenses  of  the  Commission, but not as much, I might  say  to  the Senator, as  I  really  felt  would be justified. The distinguished  chairman of the Judiciary Committee,  with his normal frugal and prudent  practice, reduced the sum below the  original proposal. But it does author ize $220,000 for each fiscal year for the  period from fiscal year 1984 through  1992.  ",1984
286,1302,1,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I inquire  further of the Senator from Maryland  as to whether or not, in his opinion, a  budget waiver would be necessary for.  this matter.  ",1984
287,1302,1,Mr. MATHIAS., We have already ob tained a budget waiver. That has been  adopted. The Senator's question  is  very well taken.  ,1984
288,1302,1,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, under the  circumstances, since the $2 million re mains in the bill, I rise in opposition to  S. SOO,  the legislation  to establish a  commission  to  commemorate  the  SOOth anniversary of the voyages of  Christopher Columbus, notwithstand ing  the excellent and well-informed  statements by the Senator from Mary land and the Senator from New York.  I agree with all that they have said in  supporting the concept of the celebra tion of the SOOth anniversary of the  wonderous discovery of America by  Christopher Columbus. However,  I  strongly oppose only that portion of  the bill providing $2 million in taxpay ers' funds.  As we begin the 2d session of the  98th Congress, we should be address ing ways to make progress toward seri ous deficit reductions. Instead, one of  our first acts will be to consider legis lation to create a commission whose  goal is to spend Government funds on  yet another national celebration.  Last November,  the  congressional  budget  process  collapsed when we  failed to enact even a meager reconcili ation bill. If we do not get this budget  process back on track, we will witness  further adverse effects on the already scary Federal deficits. Thereby driving  up even more the skyrocketing nation al debt. Unfortunately, we are seeing  very little leadership from the White  House on the deficit  issue and most  administration  spokesmen  right  on  down the line, including the President  himself, would have us believe that we  can get by with no major action  to  reduce these deficits. Expressing con cern about  them  is not enough-we  need action. Congress cannot continue  acting like it believes in these phony  economic fairy tales.  The economic policies we keep fol lowing add to the deficit and the na tional debt, driving up interest rates  further and thus pushing higher and  higher our already terribly overvalued  dollar-which is wrecking our changes  of selling our agricultural and manu factured products in the international  marketplace. Meanwhile, our deficit in  trade balance is the worst in history,  with only prospects of it getting much  worse.  I concede that this proposed $2 mil lion expenditure over a 9-year period  to commemorate the voyages of Chris topher Columbus is a relatively minor  straw, but nevertheless one  that we  can discard right now without hurting  anyone and make at least a feeble be ginning or a down payment,  if you  will, to show some fiscal restraint. It is  long past the  time when we should  begin,  before  the  fragile  economic  house of millions of big and  little  budgetary straws that has been hap hazardly fashioned goes up in smoke.  It was for this reason that last fall I  blocked  the  unanimous  voice  vote  which was ""all set"" and  insisted  in stead upon  a  rollcall  vote  on  the  Senate day care center authorization,  hoping reason would prevail. The re sulting debate and record vote indicat ed strong opposition, but it unfortu nately was passed.  It was  for  this  reason that this Senator attempted to  make the Martin Luther King holiday  a day of observance without spending  taxpayer funds on another paid holiday. It was for this reason I voted to  table  tuition  tax  credit  legislation.  While I basically feel it is in order, I  do not think we can afford to finance  that or anything else of this nature or  magnitude until we begin to get the  deficit and the budget under control.  And it is for this reason that I now  insist on debate and a rollcall vote on  this measure to spend $2 million to ob serve the SOOth anniversary of the dis covery of America by Christopher Co lumbus.

290,1302,1,Mr. EXON., I am happy to yield.  ,1984
291,1302,1,Mr. RANDOLPH.," As  the Senator  knows, we now  celebrate Columbus  Day on a date that has no real signifi cance. The Senator knows that. That  is one of the problems we have had  here. We forget.  The Senator will  recall  that mem bers of  the Armed Forces who had  served came back  to appeal  to  the  Congress after we had set up one of  these Mondays and Veterans Day went  back  to November 11. That was  the  original date,  the Armistice Day, of  course, for World War I.  I think the able Senator speaks in a  logical  and well-reasoned way  this  afternoon about these matters. If we  are to really honor an event or an indi vidual, it should be on the day that  that event occurred or the individual  was born. Would the Senator agree?  ",1984
292,1302,1,Mr. EXON., I would agree.  ,1984
293,1302,1,Mr. RANDOLPH.," Using long week ends  regardless of  the date,  is not  right, is it?  ",1984
294,1302,1,Mr. EXON.," I agree with my friend. I  think we should celebrate things on  the date they happened. I simply say  that in this particular case-and I am  not the sponsor of this measure, but I  was given to understand that it would  be-celebrated, on, supposedly, the day  that Christopher Columbus discovered  America,  if we know what that day  was.  I  suspect,  though,  that,  in the  end, it will be another weekend, as the  Senator  and my  good  friend  from  West Virginia so aptly has put it.  ",1984

298,1328,1,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  today I am introducing a Senate joint  resolution to designate the month of  June 1984 as ""Student Awareness at  Drunk Driving Month."" I am especial ly pleased to be joined in this effort by  Senators DoLE and PELL, who served as  members of the Presidential Commis sion on Drunk Driving.  Drunk driving is the leading cause of  death for Americans between the ages  of 15 to 24. Thousands of young per sons each year are lost to drunk driv ing accidents.  All over the country, groups such as  Students Against Drunk Driving are  focusing attention on these tragedies.  SADD plays a vital and indispensable  role  in having students  talk  to stu dents and to their parents and teach ers  to combat drunk driving, which  has caused death and injuries of loved  ones and fellow students.  It ~s appropriate for the Congress to  recognize  the  efforts of SADD,  to  reduce the impact of drunk drivers on  our Nation's highways.  Therefore, I am introducing this res olution to designate June of 1984 as a  special  time to support and applaud  the efforts of students and those who  assist them in combating drunk driv ing. This will also be a time to rededi cate our Nation's efforts to preserving  the lives of our sons, daughters, neigh bors and friends across the Nation. A  companion resolution has been intro duced in the House by Congressman  RAYMOND McGRATH of New York.e  By Mr. MOYNIHAN <for himself  and Mr. DODD):  S.J. Res. 223. A joint resolution re lating to the rehabilitation of shelters  for the homeless; to the Committee on  Appropriations.  REHABILITATION OF SHELTERS FOR THE  HOMELESS  e ",1984
299,1328,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  today I call upon my colleagues to join  me  in urging  the appropriation of  funds to rehabilitate structures for use  as shelters for America's homeless citi zens.  The  housing  authorization  amendment  to the supplemental ap propriations conference report, passed  by the Senate during the final days of  the first session  last November, au thorized $60 million to support the re habilitation of structures for use as  shelters for the homeless, and $25 mil lion  to  fund demonstration projects  coordinating  local  efforts  to  assist  families  trying  to  locate  affordable  housing. To date, these funds have not  been appropriated.  This Congress has responded gener ously to the needs of the homeless, by  appropriating some $150 million since  March  1983,  to  provide  short-term  emergency food and shelter services.  These moneys, however, may be used  only  for  operating  expenses.  The  equally necessary support for capital  expenses,  associated with  providing  shelter  for  the homeless,  have not  been appropriated.  The record cold spell that gripped  the country over the recent holiday  season should have reminded us all,  once again, of the acute vulnerability  of homeless Americans.  In Philadel phia, 15,000 men, women, and children  received emergency family housing in  1983-five times the number in 1981.  But nowhere is the tragedy more vivid,  more painful, than in New York City,  where thousands of residents are with out homes  this winter. Despite  the  city's gallant efforts to provide tempo rary shelters, a  serious shortage of  suitable arrangements  remains. The  largest  publicly  sponsored  shelter  system is in New York, which is now  housing 6,000 people, more than twice  the capacity of 2 years ago. The New  York City Coalition for the Homeless  estimates  that between  40,000  and  60,000 people passed  through emer gency shelters in New York last year.  We cannot close our eyes  to  this  growing problem, nor can we afford to  squander the opportunity offered us  in sections 216 and 225 of the housing  authorization measure-that of reha bilitating structures, so that the thou sands of homeless Americans can have  a better chance of finding a roof over  their heads and a warm bed to sleep in  at night.  I urge the Senate to take action to  appropriate  the  funds  authorized  under  sections 216  and 225  of  the  housing  authorization measure,  so  that these funds may be available this  winter. Release of these funds will aid  greatly the efforts in every State to  address  the  serious  and  immediate  problems of providing adequate shel ter for America's homeless.  I would ask unanimous consent that  the complete text of the resolution be  printed in the RECORD.  Mr. President,  I would ask  to be  printed in the RECORD,  following the  resolution, an article appearing in the  New York Times on Monday, January  30, 1984. This article, ""The Other City:  New York's Homeless,"" tells the tragic  story of the homeless through the ex periences of Mae Ash, Ernest Alvozo,  and Donna Gray.

301,1393,1,Mr.  ANDREWS  of  Texas.," Mr.  Speaker,  the most  pressing  issue  before Congress today is the growing  Federal deficit. If the deficit is not re duced,  interest rates will soar. This  means that young couples will not be  able to buy their first homes; senior  citizens will see  their savings erode;  small businesses will be unable to get  loans at rates they can afford; people  will be thrown out of work.  The cumulative postwar debt com piled  by  all  the  Presidents  from  Truman to Carter amounts to $477 bil lion.  Since  President Reagan  has  taken office the debt has increased by  $560 billion. Not only  is  this  larger  than the total postwar debt accumuEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  lated over the past 35 years, but the  projected deficit for next year will be  around $200 billion for the third year  in a row. This means that the current  administration will have added more  to the Federal debt in 4 years than all  the previous Presidents from George  Washington  to  Jimmy Carter  com bined.  What has caused this huge increase  in the debt and produced the annual  $200  billion  deficits  of  the past  2  years? In testimony before the House  Budget Committee, Martin Feldstein,  Chairman of the President's Council  of Economic Advisers said:  The things that raise the deficit are de fense  spending,  interest on  the national  debt and tax reduction.  Feldstein also stated:  I think the most important thing to em phasize is that the problem is not this year's  deficit, but a projected string of deficits out  into the future. The most direct measure of  the effect of that string of deficits is what it  will do to the national debt. We would see  over the next 5 or 6 years the national debt  rising by about $1,000 billion, about $1 tril lion.  The annual Federal deficit is like a  loan. When you or I need extra money  to buy a house or a car we take out a  loan to cover the cost of that purchase  because it exceeds what we can afford  on our monthly income or one year's  wages. That loan will be paid off over  a period of years  to  the bank that  loaned us the money. We will also pay  interest on that loan, and until we pay  off the loan the money we borrowed  will be part of our debt. If we take out  more loans our debt will increase.  The same is true of the Federal defi cit. The deficit represents the amount  of money the Government spent in a  single year that was greater than the  amount  that it earned.  In order  to  cover  the  deficit  the Government  must borrow money from banks, and  the total amount of that loan is added  to the debt we already owe.  Eventually, if a person takes out too  many loans, the debt they accumulate  will exceed what they can afford to  pay-even over  the  long  term-and  they will go bankrupt. But when the  Federal Government  takes out  too  many loans, it does not go bankrupt.  Instead, it borrows more money from  the bank. This means that there is less  money for businesses to borrow.  This year the Federal Government is  borrowing 75 percent of  the money  available for capital investment. That  means all the businesses in America  are competing for the other 25 percent  of the available funds, and this situa tion causes interest rates to soar.  There  are  several  proposals  and  ideas  to deal with  the deficit. One  short-term solution which I strongly  support is the pay-as-you-go proposals  introduced by Representative GEORGE  MILLER. This proposal  is  simple:  It  states that before the President and  Congress can initiate any new spend1391  ing programs,  they must have  the  money  to pay  for  them.  In other  words, if Congress wants to spend $10  million on a new program, it must first  identify $10 million of savings else where in the Federal budget that will  pay for the program, or generate $10  million in new revenues. This proposal  would also cover budget increases for  existing Federal  agencies  and  pro grams.  The  pay-as-you-go  budget  would stop the growth of the annual  deficit and would begin the reduction  process.  But we must also begin to find ways  of reducing the deficit over the long  term. The only way to accomplish this  is by developing a bipartisan consensus  on deficit reduction;  the Democratic  leadership has been trying to encour age  this for months. A start toward  this goal has already been made. Last  year a  group called  the Bipartisan  Budget Appeal, made up of prominent  business  and  finance  leaders,  and  former  government  officials,  was  formed. It called for a multiyear com mitment to deficit reduction with the  emphasis on fairness in spending cuts,  the need to increase revenue, and the  importance of stimulating new busi ness investment.  Recently, the Washington Post car ried an editorial by four Governors  calling for deficit reduction. The Gov ernors-two  Republicans  and  two  Democrats-called  for  a  bipartisan  effort to make hard political choices in  order to deal with the deficit. They  suggested restructuring the growth of  entitlement  programs  and COLA's,  limiting the growth of defense spend ing and raising taxes. They recognized  that while these proposals are politi cally unpopular, the only other alter native is an endless stream of $200 to  $300 billion in annual deficits-which  would mean all Americans would have  to save $2,000 to $3,000 more each year  and loan it to the Federal Government  to keep the Government afloat.  For the past 2 years, several Mem bers of Congress, most notably Demo crat Representative JIM JONES, have  been  trying  to get the President  to  focus attention on the central problem  of the deficit. Therefore, I was encour aged when President Reagan,  in his  State of the Union Address, joined in  these efforts in calling for a bipartisan  effort between both Houses of Con gress and the administration to reduce  the deficit. I hope that his speech will  be followed by meaningful proposals  and not by more rhetoric.  Mr. Speaker, we must learn to pay  for what we want as a  society, and  stop mortgaging our future, and the  future of the next generation of Amer icans. We must learn to think about  not only what we want, but what we  can afford.e  ",1984

He  began flying in 1923, over 60 years ago,  making him one of the oldest active  pilots  in America. Harry Porter has  become known as the dean of aviation  in Chattanooga and throughout Ten nessee and has been awarded many  aviation honors, including the Amelia  Earhart Medal. During his aviation  career, he has been an instructor, an  FAA inspector, and a businessman. He  was  involved  in  business  at Lovell  Field between 1932 and 1967, and he  has continued into his 90th year to be  active as an adviser and consultant to  the airport.  Mr. Speaker, I urge that the bill be  adopted.  Mr. Speaker, at this point I am very  pleased to yield to our very fine col league, the gentlewoman from Tennes see <Mrs. LLOYD).  ",1984
306,4,6,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Speaker, I  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 2484, which designates the air  traffic control tower at Lovell Field in  Chattanooga, Tenn.,  as  the  ""Harry  Porter Tower.""  Harry Porter is one of the oldest li censed pilots  in the Nation and has  been flying since 1923. Since that first  flight, he has had a unique and varied  career and has become a  symbol of  aviation history to the people of Chat tanooga. Mr. Porter served as a flight  instructor in World War II,  training  thousands of pilots to fly military air craft during  that period. Later he  served as an  inspector for  the FAA  and at one point even worked for the  Internal Revenue  Service,  locating  stills hidden in the woods.  It is appropriate that the air traffic  control tower at Lovell Field be named  after Harry Porter since so much of  his life has been spent at this aviation  facility. He operated his own business  at Lovell Field from 1932, when the  field opened, until 1967, when he sold  his firm. He still maintains an office  there as well as a position as adviser  and consultant to the present owners.  Harry  Porter  has  had  a  distin guished career and has been awarded  many honors  including  the coveted  Amelia Earhart Medal. He will soon be  celebrating his 90th birthday in Chat tanooga where he still resides with his  wife, Eunice. His 89th birthday has  not stopped him though. He regularly  flies about 5 hours a week. I look forthank  LLOYD,  ward  to my  visits  to  his  facilities  where a warm welcome and a word of  encouragement greets me.  In view of his accomplishments  in  the field of aviation, and his contribu tion to aviation I  think it only right  that we name the air traffic control  tower  at Lovell  Field  after Harry  Porter and  I urge my colleagues  to  support this measure.

308,4,6,Mr. HOW ARD.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of this bill. This will honor  one of Tennessee's and Chattanooga's  aviation leaders, Harry Porter. It is a  bill that has passed the Senate with out objection, and we know of no ob jection in the House. The administra tion has also informed the committee  that they have no objection.  I  congratulate  the  distinguished  gentlelady  from  Tennessee,  Mrs.  for  introducing  the bill and  bringing Mr. Porter's achievements to  our attention.  Again, I urge passage of this bill. It  is a well-deserved recognition for one  of the Nation's great aviators.e  e ",1984
309,4,6,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Speaker, I  join  my colleagues in supporting H.R. 2484  which would redesignate the air traf fic control  tower at Lovell Field  in  Chattanooga, Tenn.,  as  the  ""Harry  Porter Tower.""  Harry Porter, who began flying  in  1923, is one of the oldest active pilots  the United States, who not only  served his country in World War I, but  again  in World War  II when  he  trained many of our military pilots.  During his notable  career, he  also  served as an FAA inspector and has  been awarded many honors, including  the Amelia Earhart Medal  for  his  major contributions to aviation.  Lovell Field in Chattanooga is the  fourth  largest commercial facility  in  the State of Tennessee and, in light of  Mr.  Porter's  continuous  presence  there for over 50 years,  it would be  most fitting if the airport tower was  renamed in his honor. In addition, the  city commission of Chattanooga has  unanimously  requested  that  this  honor be bestowed on Mr. Porter.  As is the usual practice with legisla tion of this nature, H.R. 2484 includes  language which will assure that the  FAA will not be required to change  any air traffic control procedures or  republish  any aeronautical  informa tion which refers to the tower as the  Chattanooga Tower.  For  these  reasons,  I urge my col leagues to support H.R. 2484.e  e ",1984

311,17,6,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, as one who  has advocated pharmacy crime legisla tion since  the 96th Congress,  I  am  pleased  to  support  this  legislation  which will see to it that our Nation's  pharmacists, and indeed all DEA regis trants, have  the Federal protection  they must have if they are to continue  dispensing necessary drugs  to  their  customers with any sense of security.  I particularly want to commend the  distinguished chairman of  the Sub committee on Crime, Mr. HUGHES, and  HAROLD SA WYER,  ranking Republican  on the subcommittee, for their efforts  to resolve many questions which arose  during  consideration  of  legislation.  The HUGHES' bill, H.R. 5222, is a good  bill, and one which I feel deserves my  colleagues' unanimous support.  Those who have devoted consider able time and effort to this issue over  the years fully recognize the delicate  balance which exists-and which must  be maintained-if we are to see legisla tion signed into law in this Congress.  As we all know, politics is the art of  compromise, and nowhere is that more  evident than in the legislation before  us today.  In addition to expressing my sincere  thanks  to  Chairman  HUGHES  and  HAROLD SA WYER,  I also want to par ticularly thank subcommittee counsel,  Hayden Gregory and Eric Sterling.  Charlene Van Lier, Republican coun sel for the subcommittee, has provided  outstanding advice and counsel. Par ticularly  helpful  and welcome  has  been the support, encouragement, and  well-reasoned suegestions by the Na tional Association  of Chain Drug  Stores and  the National Wholesale  Druggists Association.  Last but certainly not least, I wish to  thank  those of my  colleagues who  have steadfastly cosponsored  legisla tion on this issue which I have intro duced in the last two Congresses. It  was their continued support since the  96th Congress which  provided  the  strength  to  continue  the  fight  on  behalf of those throughout the coun try  who  dispense  controlled  sub stances. I am convinced that their sup port has been crucial in our efforts to  provide  an  appropriate Federal  re sponse  to a  rapidly  increasing prob lem.

313,30,6,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker,  4  years  ago,  then  candidate Ronald  Reagan asked the voters to ask them selves, ""Are you better off than you  were 4 years ago?"" It is time to ask the  question again. And if you are not a  member Gf  the superrich among us,  the  answer,  despite  the President's  protestation of an overwhelming eco nomic recovery, is a resounding ""no.""  It may come as a  surprise to hear  this. After all,  the administration  is  claiming  that  unemployment  has  taken a downturn, inflation has sub sided, and retail sales are  increasing  throughout  the Nation. These  facts  are all true. But when put in the 4year perspective,  the changes in the  economy do not appear to equal much  of an accomplishment. Reaganomics,  contrary to what the President would  have us believe, has failed to produce a  significant  recovery. The only ones  who are receiving significant benefit  from  the  administration's programs  are the superrich, and they are getting  richer.  The administration's tax program,  for example, was hailed as the first  step on the road to economic recovery.  The question is: Economic recovery for  whom? Published studies have shown  that the benefits gained from recent  Federal  tax  reductions  rise substan tially with the amount of household  income  recorded.  Under  current  policy,  the richer you are now,  the  richer you  are going  to be  in  the  future.  The view that the economy  is  im proving for the country as a whole is  supported only in comparisons of the  current figures to the administration's  own previous economic performance.  For example, in January 1980, the un employment rate was 6.2 percent. By  November 1982, as a result of the im plementation of  the administration's  policies, the unemployment rate had  risen to 10.7 percent. When the Presi dent claims the current rate of 7 .8 per cent is a great accomplishment, I am  skeptical. The fact is that the unem ployment rate was 6.2 percent when  the President  took office, and now,  over 3 years into his term, that rate is  7 .8 percent. That does not sound like a  wonderous  achievement  to  me.  I  wonder how  the administration can  claim an improvement in the economy  rate  for  taking  the  unemployment  from 6.2 to 7.8 percent.  This  is  like buying a used bicycle,  letting it deteriorate, and then trying  to sell it as new. The Reagan adminis tration is attempting to convince the  American people that the economy is  operating  effectively.  Luckily,  the  American people know enough about  the state of the economy to recognize  when economic  indicators are being  manipulated before their eyes. Present  policies help  those who need  it the  least-the  extraordinarily  wealthy  Americans at the top.  Economic  recovery  is  a misnomer  when only the richest members of the  population see any evidence of eco nomic improvement. When unemploy ment is reduced to meaningful levels,  when  inflation  is  truly  lowered, and  when retail sales remain at high levels,  then let the administration claim vic tory over the Nation's economic woes.  Comparing the current economic indi cators to those in 1980, and consider ing the present problems, it is difficult  to see how current policies are success ful in meeting the economic concerns  of all Americans.e  CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R.  4072  Mr. DE LA GARZA submitted the fol lowing conference  report and state ment on the bill <H.R. 4072> to provide  for an improved program for wheat.

314,56,6,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, the  Senate will shortly be called upon to  commit the first $150 million for the  planning of an orbiting civilian space  station. This relatively small first step  of funding will lead to one giant leap  into a  highly questionable program  which may ultimately cost the taxpay ers $20 billion or more over the next  15 years.  Two recent articles cogently argue  the folly of moving forward on this  NASA-instigated  outer  space white  elephant.  Thomas Gold, a professor of astron omy at Cornell Center for Radiophy sics and Space Research at Cornell  University,  convincingly argues  that  such a space station would indeed be a  misstep for mankind because it would  divert funds from cheaper but scientif ically  more  important  unmanned  space projects.  Mark Washburn, writing in yester day's Washington Post, expands upon  Dr. Gold's ~omments. He points out  the tremendous costs of providing life support and redundant safety systems  for manned space flights.  Since unmanned space craft can do  just about all  the  tasks a manned  space craft can but at a considerably  lower price and also perform many sci entific experiments beyond the ability  of manned space craft, I am at a loss  to  understand  the need  to hastily  spend  tens of billions of dollars on  NASA's outer space version of a gigan tic public works project.  I urge my colleagues to read the arti cles by Tom Gold and Mark Wash burn, and  I  ask unanimous consent  that these articles be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the arti cles were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From Newsday, Mar. 20, 19841  SPACE STATION-A MISSTEP FOR MANKIND  <By Thomas Gold)  When, in 1957, the space age began with  the launching of the Soviet Sputnik, it fired  the imagination of people all over the globe.  To most people it was a vindication of sci ence fiction, a victory of ""far-out thinking""  over  the dreary and unimaginative. Here  was  the  first  step  accomplished  of  the  ladder of science-fiction achievement, whose  later rungs are manned flight around the  solar system and then even to the stars.  All these things had been predicted and  been said to be impossible. Who was not to  say  that  they could not all be done? It  seemed that the courageous thinkers were  right and the timid would perish in ridicule.  This dream world was the very real back ground against which the government had  to guide its space programs. Financing was  dependent on the support of a broad cross section of the people, and an appeal to their  space dreams became a major factor in all  planning. However useful unmanned, instru mented vehicles proved to be, the National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  judged manned flights to have the greater  public  appeal. The  culmination  of  this  policy was  the ""greatest show on Earth,""  the 1969 Apollo landing on the Moon (600  million viewers on world television), and it  showed what can be achieved for $21 billion.  Alas, this giant step for mankind was not  to  be  followed  by  another. The Apollo  flights to the moon now look more like the  end of an era rather than the beginning.  The shuttle was the next manned project,  but it could fire the imagination only if it  could be seen as the tool for new space con quests. Manned flights to Mars were hinted,  but could not be seriously proposed.  Now NASA proposes to build a space sta tion, and has obtained the support of Presi dent Reagan. A large space habitat is to be  assembled in orbit, from smaller units that  can be carried up by the shuttle. It would  house several persons, and it would be kept  permanently manned. A  range of experi ments and observations would be carried out  on board. The cost? It is hardly worth quot ing  the $8-billion  to $20-billion estimates  now being made.  The expense of the space station project  would be much greater than that of con struction. A  regular  sequence  of  space  launches would be required to supply and  refurbish the spacelab. Running the space  station would become the bread-and-butter  work of NASA on a far higher level of ex penditure than NASA is operating on now.  A commitment of  this kind would assure  NASA and a substantial part of the aero space industry a high level of support for a  long time to come.  Even if the space station did not justify its  running expenses, politically it would be ex tremely difficult  to abandon such a pro gram, when  the  initial cost had been so  high. The decision to build a space station is  therefore one that will fix the direction of  the U.S. space program for a long time to  come. Is it the right direction?  It is sometimes said that it is  inevitable  that man will fly  to the other planets, or  even to other solar systems far out there  among the stars. Surely the space station is  the first step in that direction, to learn how  to assemble large units in orbit, and to learn  how to live for long periods in space.  Unfortunately, so long as we have only  the propulsion  that chemical rockets can  provide, an expedition to another planet is  not practicable. It would require the assem bly in orbit of a ship of many thousands of  tons, and the cost would be very many times  the cost of the Apollo program. The round trip time to Mars would be more than two  years. It is possible, yes, but it is not likely  to happen.  If one day a far more efficient propulsion  system is  invented,  then perhaps one can  think again. But that will not happen over night, and there will be plenty of time to ex ercise men in orbit while this new capability  is being developed. The space station is not  tackling the hard part of the problem; it is  only dealing with the part that we know we  could solve.  Another  ""inevitability""  claim  is  that  human populations will eventually spill out  into space, and large space cities will accom modate  those whom  the Earth  can no  longer harbor. The space station is to be the  first step. But if it is population pressure  that is to create this situation, then first we  would surely want  to  fill  those areas on  Earth that are empty at the moment but  much more easily supplied with the where withal for living than outer space.  Another claim has been that the space  station would serve as a good observation  post, both for looking up and looking down.  But for that it is clearly inferior to the un manned  vehicles  that  are  already  in  common use. Looking down on the Earth  for military survelliance or for the various  studies of the Earth's surface and the at mosphere requires a variety of orbits, espe cially orbits that go to high geographic lati tudes and orbits that are stationary with re spect to the rotating Earth. The space sta tion will only be in one low-latitude, close Earth orbit. and it will be essentially  im movable from that orbit. Furthermore, ob serving equipment, for the most part, has its  accurate pointing upset by  the  slightest  motion on a spacecraft. For this reason, an  unmanned vehicle is far preferable.  A manned space station could act as a  base for men to go out and assemble very  large structures, such as  radio antennas.  They could serve useful purposes, both for  astronomical observations and for terrestri al communications systems. But before de ciding that such a construction would justi fy a  reasonable fraction of  the cost of a  space station, one would have to know what  purpose is to be served, whether the orbit is  a desirable one, and what the costs of vari ous methods of assembly-manned or un manned-might be. Deciding on the means  of doing a  job before specifying  the  job  itself is never a good policy.  Another suggested purpose is the manu facture of goods in zero gravity or the good  vacuum of space. It certainly has not yet  been demonstrated that sufficiently valua ble products could be made there that could  not be made on Earth, even with  invest ments of many billions of dollars. During  the quarter century of space flight, the pos sibility has often been discussed, yet not a  single example of such a product exists.  This is so despite many manned space mis sions  that searched for  things  to do and  settle for such experiments as determining  which way guppies would swim, or whether  a particular spider could build  its web  in  zero gravity.  The one field where one cannot doubt the  utility of long-duration manned space flight  concerns the physiological effects that such  space flight has on humans. But why would  this  justify a multibillion dollar program,  when there is no plan in sight that requires  prolonged manned space flight?  Unmanned,  instrumented space vehicles  are free from many of the limitations which  exist for manned flight. They are cheap by  comparison;  light and small;  they do not  have to be returned; they can transmit any  information that can be gathered from loca tions to which they go; they can be sent on  a great variety of orbits and  trajectories,  and they can endure flights of many years'  duration.  The technology of detailed remote control  and of data management is advancing rapid ly, and any action that an astronaut could  take in an Earth-orbital vehicle could also  be commanded from  the ground  to a  re motely  controlled mechanism  in  an un manned spacecraft.  It seems  so  clear  to  many scientists and engineers that this is  the way of progress of modern technology,  that the continued preoccupation of NASA  with manned flight is a stumbling block.  The space station would drain funds and  technological ability a.way  from advanced  unmanned projects, and slow down the evo lution of our real space capabilities.  ",1984
315,69,6,Mr. KASTEN.," So I take it that the  Senator,  as  acting manager  for his  side, would be able to do that.  I  think we can assume control of 4  hours on the bill on this side, so you  would be  in the position of allowing  that time from your 4 hours on the  bill.  ",1984
316,69,6,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President,  I  yield 10 minutes from the bill plus the  3 minutes that have been yielded by  the distinguished  floor manager on  the other side, for a question of the  Senator from North Carolina.  ",1984
317,69,6,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from Montana is yielding time  from the bill.  Does  the Senator  from Wisconsin  now wish to rescind his yielding of 3  minutes from his side on this amend ment, or does he wish to let it stand?  ",1984
318,69,6,Mr. KASTEN.," I will let it stand. The  point we are trying to make is that he  now has 3 minutes from our time on  this amendment, and he has the addi tional time the Senator from Montana  is yielding from the opposition time on  the bill.  ",1984
319,69,6,The PRESIDING OFFICER., That is  correct.  The Senator from Montana.  ,1984
320,69,6,Mr. MELCHER.," I thank the Chair,  and  I  thank the distinguished floor  manager of the bill.  Will the junior Senator from North  Carolina yield for this question?  First,  is he aware of  the unspent  money  already  appropriated  for El  Salvador?  ",1984
321,69,6,Mr. EAST.," Senator, I presume there  are moneys that are currently avail able, that are in the pipeline, moving,  and one can argue over the particular  figures, I suppose, endlessly.  I saw the other day that the admin istration said it would be $400 million  over a several-year period.  So I think that whatever particular  figures we might select for debate or  argument or whatever, it still brings  me back  to  the  fundamental point  that  the  effect  of  the  Senator's  amendment would be to eliminate, for  all practical purposes, any serious con tinued, near term-and I  suppose  it  would reflect a long term-position of  military assistance to the Government  of El Salvador. I strongly dissent from  that.  ",1984
322,69,6,Mr. MELCHER.," I thank the Senator  for his explanation.  There is $160 million already appro priated, not counting  this proposed  $62 million. That has already been ap propriated in the 1984 bill for El Sal vador, $19 million is held up, but the  other $141 million is still waiting for  them  to  spend  in  the  coming  6  months.  I ask the distinguished Senator from  North Carolina  if he  thinks  that if  President Duarte is the final victor in  this election for President in El Salva dor, President Duarte is going to cam paign between now and the final election day-assuming he  is  successful  after that-that he  is going  to cam paign for less money from the United  States? Does the distinguished Sena tor  really believe  that Duarte, as a  candidate for President, and if elected  President, would  say  to  the United  States-to President Reagan, in effect,  and  to Congress-""Please don't  send  us so much money""?  ",1984
323,69,6,Mr.  EAST.,"  Let  us  assume  that  Duarte  is elected President.  I  think  that the Duarte government, for an in definite period of  time,  is going  to  need American military assistance, as  well as medical assistance and econom ic assistance, just as-if I might use a  comparison-the  Israeli  people  and  the country of Israel and the Middle  East will continue to need American  military  support  as well  as  other  forms.

329,69,6,Mr. EAST.," The  figure  I  say was  about 7 percent that was in a particu lar locale. But the Senator smiles. Let  me put it in broader perspective.  I  read  an  interesting  column by  Milton Condracky, a man of the ""lib eral to moderate"" point of view, whn is  executive editor of the New Republic,  who said in the paper the other day  that the U.S. Congress is not equipped  to micromanage  American  foreign  policy. I think he is correct.  All I am saying to the distinguished  Senator from Montana  is  this: You  can get witnesses  in here who are  saying they are getting a large number  of arms. They will get witnesses  in  who say they are not. I do not know.  You and I could go on and on endless ly about it.  Is it 7 percent? Is it more? If it is  more, where are  they getting  them  from? Some say they are getting them  from the open market that came out  of the American collapse in Vietnam,  because Congress undercut the Presi dent's efforts there, in my judgment.  In any case, I  think that what one  must acknowledge is that the practical  I  As  effect of  this niggling-and I call  it  niggling-is to get to the point that  people do not really want to give the  aid that is adequate.  One can say  the same about aid  given  to Israel, but we are going to  defend Israel, and we should defend  Israel against the Syrians-",1984

333,69,6,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President,  I  want to point up this part of the state ment by saying  that, yes, President  Monroe was a Democrat; yes, Presi dent Jefferson was a Democrat. And  they were both very great Americans,  and they both started this country on  the right course.  to  the Monroe Doctrine,  there  was nothing in the Monroe Doctrine  that said we should send armaments  to El Salvador or any other South  American country. The Monroe Doc trine is specifically what I pointed out  in my earlier remarks that provides us  authority to intervene, to prevent, to  interdict shipments of arms  into an other country for the purpose of dis turbing  the  peace  there  and  for  threatening  the peace  in  this hemi sphere.  The Senator from North Carolina  perhaps did not hear my remarks. If  he will read them in the RECORD, or I  am glad to supply him a copy, he will  find we make that very clear.  ",1984

Some Members have said that those  of us who sought to get this body to  debate this issue were rather naive in  their belief  that other Members of  this body did not really understand  Central American policy. I  think the  wording that was used was ""myopic.""  I welcome the fact that the Senator  from Montana, in his exchange with  the Senator from North Carolina, has  discussed  in  detail  the  specific  amounts of money involved. As he cor rectly pointed out in  this recent ex change, $19 million of the funds al ready appropriated have been fenced  off, but would be available virtually  overnight to the El Salvadoran Gov ernment if there were a verdict in the  trail of those charged with the murder  of  the four American churchwomen  who wen~ brutally raped and then shot  ",1984

To do that would be in viting what some of us have suggested,  a horrendous bloodbath.  I commend  the Senator.  ",1984

All of us  recognize the difficulties, all of us rec ognize the problems, but all of us rec ognize, I believe, the consequences of  the failure to act to adopt at last the  Inouye  compromsie  figure.  I  think  anything less would be tragic, not only  for the foreign policy of the United  States of America but  for Central  America overall.  I am pleased to yield such time as he  may  desire  to  the  Senator  from  Hawaii.  ",1984
344,82,6,Mr. INOUYE.," I  very much.  Senator KENNEDY  in his usual elo quence has focused upon the possibili ty of military assistance being provid ed to Roberto d' Aubuisson and conse quently my  distinguished  colleague  has argued that we should wait to see  who is elected the President of El Sal vador.  Mr. President, I wish to suggest that  if we wait until the second round of  the election before indicating our sup port of  the electoral process,  there  may never be a  freely elected Presi dent of El Salvador. The hotheads in  the military may stage a coup d'etat or  disrupt the election. Mr. President, I  pref er to act now to support the elec toral process,  to support  the recent  tentative steps which have been taken  toward democracy in El Salvador.  Mr. President, I prefer to act in an ticipation that Jose Napoleon Duarte  will be elected President. If he is elect ed, and  the Kennedy amendment  is  the law of the land, President Duarte's  cause would be set back by the inter ruption of military supplies. What we  seek to do today is to keep that supply  line open in aniticipation of a  favor able outcome to that election.  If we do not act to provide a minimal  level of assistance, it will not matter  who  is elected; the supplies will run  out. If, on the other hand, Mr. Presi dent,  the fears of Senator KENNEDY  are realized and Roberto d' Aubuisson  is elected President of El Salvador, the  flow of supplies can be stopped. We all  know that.  So, Mr. President, let us not risk a  coup or the end to the electoral proc ess  by  supporting  the  Kennedy  amendment.  ",1984
345,82,6,Mr. KENNEDY., I wonder if the Sen ator from Hawaii will yield?  ,1984
346,82,6,Mr. INOUYE., I would be very happy  to yield.  ,1984
347,82,6,Mr. KENNEDY.," First of all, I think  all of us in this body are very much  aware of the very special contributions  which have been made by the Senator  from Hawaii  in  trying  to provide a  more sensible and responsible policy  toward Central America.  I  recognize  this has been an issue in which the  Senator from Hawaii as well as  the  Senator from Kansas have been enor mously involved over a period of time.  I am interested in the logic of the  Senator from Hawaii when he states  that amendments by  those of good  faith which would terminate military  assistance after the election may open  up a bloodbath. My amendment, of  course, does not do that. It carries on  the funding at the same level as in the  amendment  of  the  Senator  from  Hawaii but only until the end of May  so we would have another opportunity  then to examine this issue.  I am interested in what is the appar ent change of position of the Senator  from Hawaii from the Appropriations  Committee markup when he opposed  the military  assistance  request  and  was defeated,  to his position at the  present time. I heard the earlier expla nation and it was one which certainly  would satisfy me  in  terms of  logic.  That  is,  the Senator  from Hawaii  thinks that unless he made this par ticular  compromise  of  $61 million,  there would be sufficient votes in this  body to get $92 million. I can under stand that, and I can count, too. I un derstand the attempt to bring about a  reduction and would therefore defend  that position. But I had thought the  Senator from Hawaii,  in the Appro priations Committee, had actually op posed additional military aid and as sistance pending the outcome of the  election.  ",1984
348,82,6,Mr. INOUYE.," If the Senator from  Massachusetts  had  checked  the  RECORD, he would have noted that my  amendment called for  the postpone ment  of  the  consideration  of  this  whole package until after  the  first  round-that was Sunday-on the basis  that we would like to know what the  possible outcome would be.  I had no  idea what the outcome would be on  Wednesday  before  the  election  on  Sunday.  Second, before bringing up my pro posal,  I had made a private  inquiry  among the members of the Appropria tions Committee, and it was very ap parent to me that if the issue came  down to zero funding or a $93 million  appropriation, the $93 million request  would have easily prevailed.  My suggestion for a postponement  was a test case because I thought it is  a  simple  thing  just to postpone  the  consideration  for  less  than a week.  Sixteen Senators-more than a majori ty of  the committee-voted against  that proposal.  I am convinced that if left to the  Senate to decide whether we cut off  military  assistance or give  the  full  amount, or in the case of the Senator's  amendment give  the full amount or  $21 million,  the  full amount would  ",1984

354,121,6,Mr.  HATFIELD.," Mr.  President  Evelyn Murray, a tireless opponent of  nerve gas weapons production, recent ly brought the following article to my  attention. It serves as the foundation  for the current scientific study of the  Reagan  administration  charge  that  the Soviet Union employed chemical  weapons in Southeast Asia. In the case  presented to Congress during discus sion of nerve gas weapons production  funding in the fiscal year 1984 Depart ment of Defense appropriations bill,  the administration pointed to evidence  of ""Yellow Rain""  in Southeast Asia.  Because it is obvious that the Soviet  violated the 1925 Geneva protocol on  chemical weapons and the 1972 treaty  on  biological  and  toxic  weapons,  argued proponents, the United States  must renew production of nerve gas  weapons to maintain a suficient deter rent. In assuming the obvious, however,  the  administration  ignored  the  most  basic  requirement  of  science:  Proof. The following article could shed  profound  light  on  the  allegations.  ""Yellow Rain"" by Louis Ember was  published in the January 9, 1984 edi tion  of Chemical  and Engineering  News.  The article follows:  [From the Chemical and Engineering News,  Jan. 9, 19841  THE SCIENCE OF YELLOW RAIN  The entire June 6, 1983,  issue of C&EN  examined the uncertainties over the health  effects of dioxin in the environment. Simi larly, this issue is largely devoted to another  matter involving chemicals in the environ ment: yellow rain.  Yellow rain is the imprecise name given to  toxin-based weapons  the U.S. government  charges the Soviet Union and its allies of  using  in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan.  The editorial in the June 6 issue described  the dioxin matter as ""a brew of uncertain  science, unanswered and sometimes unan swerable health questions, regulatory dilem mas,  intensive press  coverage,  and  legal  maneuverings."" As it turns out, that descrip tion fits the yellow rain issue too.  The U.S. charge  is  in keeping with the  Reagan Administration's characterization of  the Soviet Union as the ""focus of evil in the  modern world."" It is also an incredibly seri ous charge. It undermines all arms negotia tions because it accuses the Soviet Union of  flagrant violation of both the 1925 Geneva  Protocol on chemical weapons and the 1972  treaty on biological and toxin weapons.  In view of the critical nature of this issue,  it would not be unreasonable to expect that  the U.S. has an irrefutably strong case to  support its charges, and, especially, that the  supporting science is sound. But this is not  the case.  When Secretary of State Alexander Haig  first accused the Soviets in September 1981,  the only scientific evidence in hand was the  unconfirmed finding by one laboratory of  parts-per-millon  quantities  of  three  tri chothecene toxins on a single leaf and stem  taken from an alleged chemical attack site  in Kampuchea. To this day the sum total of  physical evidence from Afghanistan consists  of a trace amount of a trichothecene on the  face of a  gas mask obtained-apparently  purchased-in Kabul. The total of govern ment-obtained positive environmental sam ples from Southeast Asia has grown only to  five. These all have been reported by one  private  laboratory. None have been con firmed by independent analyses. The Army  has failed  to find  trichothecenes  in more  than 50 such samples it has tested. And evi dence from biomedical samples from alleged  victims is ambiguous.  The government claims that it is very dif ficult to obtain physical evidence of chemi cal warfare from remote and wartorn areas  to which it has no access and that its scien tific effort should not be  judged by  the  standards of a Ph. D. thesis. This is reasona ble. But it does not explain why the scientif ic case the government has tendered public ly has been so poorly presented, why it lacks  the normal cross-checks, and why elements  of it have been at variance with data al ready in the scientific literature. It also does  not explain the lack of serious response to  issues  raised by knowledgeable  scientists.  But it does reflect a contempt for good sci ence shown by some within the State De partment.  The government  implies  that  it  really  does not need the science, that it can prove  its case with an overwhelming volume of  eyewitness reports and classified data. This  is disingenuous First,  the government did  not go public with its charges until it had  the first ""smoking gun"" evidence in hand.  And, second, it is very difficult to conceive  how  it can substantiate  its central  thesis  that the Soviet Union is behind the use of  toxin weapons  in Southeast Asia without  the science.  Government  scientists  investigating  yellow rain have been in an unenviable posi tion ever since Haig first went public with  his charge. This position becomes more dif ficult with every repetition of the charge.  The uncertainties over the science of yellow  rain cannot be left unresolved. Until they  are settled, they cloud the issue of whether  treaty-violating chemical of any kind have  been used in recent times in Southeast Asia.  A first step should be a peer review of the  government's yellow rain case by an inde pendent panel of scientists, conducted in an  open manner and with access to as much of  the intelligence as can prudently be declas sified.  MICHAEL HEYLIN,  Editor.  YELLOW RAIN  For years, and from faraway places have  come reports of death and sickness from the  skies. The tales from ruggedly independent  and mostly  illiterate mountain people of  Laos, Kampuchea, and Afghanistan tell of  aircraft-,  rocket-,  and  artillery-delivered  clouds of yellowish material that killed rap idly and grotesquely those directly hit. Vil lagers more  fortunate and  further away  became ill, but with a strange combination  of symptoms.  Survivors often  told  tales of mysterious  yellow rainlike spots on or near their vil lages that they called yellow rain and associ ated with deaths and illnesses. These tales  spurred U.S.  investigations. First U.S. em bassy personnel collected the victims' grim  stories. Then military physicians examined  these people, now  in  refugee camps,  for  signs of chemical agents used. And finally,  the U.S. launched an intensified search for  physical evidence.  From the early surveys came the specula tion that three possible agents-a harassing  agent, a nerve gas, and an unknown chemi cal-were being used. Chemical analysis of  collected material proved futile. No  tradi tional chemical agent-no riot control gas,  mustard gas, or nerve gas-could be detect ed. And still the reports of skin irritation  and lesions, of bloody diarrhea and vomit ing, of dizziness and trembling, and of death  flooded local embassies after alleged yellow  rain attacks. The mysterious  toxic agent  causing these symptoms remained elusive to  the chemist's probe for seven years.  Then on Sept. 13, 1981, in West Germany,  Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig ad dressed the Berlin Press Association. In an  otherwise unnotable speech, Haig said: ""For  some time now, the international communi ty has been alarmed by continuing reports  that the Soviet Union and its allies have  been using lethal chemical weapons in Laos,  Kampuchea, and Afghanistan .... We now  have physical evidence from Southeast Asia  which has been analyzed and found to con tain abnormally high levels of three potent  mycotoxins-poisonous  substances not  in digenous to the region and which are highly  toxic to man and animals.""

355,134,6,Mr.  HEINZ.," Mr.  President,  this  week  the Congressional Wives  for  Soviet Jewry is hosting an internation al  conference  in Washington, D.C.  With over 50 wives of Members of the  U.S. Congress, as well as wives from  members of the Canadian, British, Is raeli,  and Netherland Governments,  the CWSJ has become a forceful and  active participant in the international  effort to call attention to the plight of  Soviet Jewry and to support efforts to  free the thousands of victims of Soviet  oppression.  It is testament to this great democ racy we  call America  that  these  women will assemble in our Nation's  Capital to meet with top administra tion officials such as Robert McFar lane, Assistant  to  the President for  National Security Affairs, and Elliott  Abrams,  Assistant  Secretary  for  Human Rights and Humanitarian Af fairs, and to hear Elie Wiesel, himself  a Holocaust survivor and one of the  most eloquent voices in opposition to  persecution,  discrimination,  and  op pression wherever  it  exists  in  the  world. No such opportunities exist in  the Soviet Union.  Anatoly Shcharansky, Iosif Begun, Viktor  Brailovsky, Ida Nudel, these are just a few  of the literally hundreds of names that have  become symbols of  the movement  to put  pressure on the Soviet Government so that  these innocent victims can achieve a  long held dream of  joining  their  family  and  friends in the United States or Israel. Our  efforts toward this important goal must not  cease.  Mr. President, I would like to take  this opportunity to extent my sincere  appreciation  to  the  congressional  wives  for  their work on behalf of  Soviet Jewry, and to the National Con ference on Soviet Jewry for their ef forts. Mr. President,  I  ask  to have  printed in the RECORD a  letter I  re ceived from Elena Fridman, the sister  of  Ida Nude!, who  is now  living  in  Israel and eagerly awaiting her sister's  release from the Soviet Union. I would  also like to place in the RECORD a New  York Times article about the congres sional wives conference this week.  The letters follow:  REHOVOT, ISRAEL, February 28, 1984.  Hon. H. JOHN HEINZ,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, D. C., U.S.A.  DEAR SENATOR HEINZ: I continue to appre ciate the depth of your concern for the fate  of my sister, Ida Nudel, and your efforts to  bring about the reunification of our small  family.  I write to you at this time in anticipation  of the upcoming international conference of  the Congressional Wives for Soviet Jewry  scheduled to take place in Washington D.C.  at  the beginning of April, knowing  that  many of Ida's and my friends will partici pate and hoping you will share this report  with  those  participants with whom you  have contact.  Having legally completed her sentence of  four years of  internal exile  in Siberia  in  March 1982, followed by a frightening six month period of homelessness during which  she was denied municipal residence permits  in  numerous  places,  including  her  own  apartment in Moscow, she was finally al lowed  residence  in  the  small Moldavian  town of Bendery. Yet this has proved to be  another form of exile.  It was the thousands of letters she had re ceived in Siberia which had helped sustain  her spirit. Since arriving  in Bendery, she  has received almost no mail. Many people  have written to me saying that their letters  have been returned with a note from  the  Soviet  postal  authorities  indicating  ""In connu: No Such Address."" I have seen some  of the envelopes and know they have been  correctly addressed.  For the past year she has worked as an  attendant at the local Bendery amusement  park. Her heart condition has flared up on  occasion, but she has not left the town for  medical  treatment, as she had previously  been told that her entry into Moscow was  forbidden.  During  the past  two months,  I  have  become increasingly alarmed by certain new  developments. The Soviet authorities seem  to be  intent on precipitating yet another  confrontation with Ida by outrageous provo cations.  This began on January 5 of  this year  when  she was  summoned  by  the  local  deputy police chief who warned her that  she was  being watched  ""by  the people  whose job it is to do so"" and that she was  not to have any more visits to her home by  the ""people who call  themselves  'refuse niks'."" She was also warned not  to  leave  Bendery.  Non-compliance  would  mean  arrest, the official said. The timing of this  warning was clearly a result of Ida's celebra tion of the Jewish holiday of Chanuka with  some friends who  joined her three weeks  earlier.  On January 24, 1984, she was summoned  by Mr. Arlen Mikhailovitch  Shebanow,  Deputy Chairman of the Bendery Supervi sory Commission on Laws on Religion, who  stated that he knew that on the Jewish reli gious holiday of Chanuka people got togeth er in her home. He suggested to her that  she register herself according to the by-laws  pertaining to religious groups in Moldavia.  According to law <he proceeded to quote the  following):  ""Passed as an Order by Presidium Su preme Soviet of Moldavia SSR, Number  1616-IX-19/V 1977  ""Paragraph 8: An organization or group of  people who believe may begin their activi ties only after a  decision as been  taken  based on  registration by  the Committee  dealing With Religious Matters of the Su preme SSSR Committee of Ministers.""  Ida bravely replied that matters of reli gious belief are not a proper subject for dis cussion between a government official and a  private citizen. The official  indicated that  not applying for this registration would be a  clear violation of this law  if she plans to  again have people in her home to celebrate  such holidays.  Senator Heinz, I have come to know you  as a friend of Ida's as someone concerned  with her fate. I am alarmed by this latest  development. The Soviet authorities are ob viously bent on making the advent of every  holiday in the Jewish calendar a period of  fear for Ida, for me and for all those dedi cated people the world over who treasure  the principles which guide her.  After twelve years of refusals, as she ap proaches her 53th birthday on April 27, the  time has certainly come for the Soviet au thorities to relent and allow her to join me  in Israel. I know that with your continued  help, we  can  accomplish  this  seemingly  modest but inexplicably difficult goal.  Sincerely yours,  ELENA FRIDMAN.  CONGRESSIONAL WIVES TAKE ON DELICATE  ISSUE  <By Barbara Gamarekian)  WASHINGTON, April 1.-For more than five  years, a group of Congressional wives has  quietly pursued a cause. The women write  letters, make speeches, hold silent vigils in  front of the Soviet Embassy and meet with  dissidents in Moscow and Russian emigres  in Washington.  The group, Congressional Wives for Soviet  Jewry, is one of the many organizations in  the capital with a cause. In this case, the  women have banded together to support the  cause of human rights in the Soviet Union.  Congressional Wives for Soviet Jewry  is  sponsoring  a  three-day  conference  that  starts today. Some 20 wives of Members of  Parliament  from Canada, England,  Israel  and  the Netherlands will  join wives  of  American lawmakers in meetings with offi cials, including President Reagan's national  security adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, and  the Assistant Secretary of State for Human  Rights, Elliot Abrams. On Tuesday night,  Elie Wiesel, the noted writer on the Holo caust. will speak at a dinner in the Senate  Caucus Room.  NO MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR  A request to meet with the Soviet Ambas sador here has gone unanswered, according  to Dolores Beilenson, co-chairman of  the  group. And a request that the women meet  with Nancy Reagan, Mrs. Beilenson said,  ""could not be worked out.""  Mrs. Beilenson is the wife of Representa tive Anthony C. Beilenson, Democrat of  California. The other cochairmen of  the  group are Joanne Kemp, wife of Represent ative Jack Kemp, Republican of Buffalo;  Teresa Heinz, wife of Senator John Heinz,  Republican of Pennsylvania, and Shirley  Metzenbaum, wife of Senator Howard M.  Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio.  The group was founded  in 1978 by Mrs.  Kemp and Helen Jackson, wife of Senator  Henry M. Jackson, the Washington Demo crat who died last year, after several Con gressional  wives  had met with  Avital  Shcharansky, wife of the imprisoned Jewish  dissident Anatoly B. Shcharansky.  The 45 members of  the group  include  women whose husbands represent all shades  of the political spectrum.  ",1984

""We will work with business and industry  to define and describe what kind of training  and retraining they think they will need to  obtain employment,"" he said.  That, he indicated, will determine the size  of the student body.  advisory  committee  of  industry  people will help shape the curriculum,"" he  said. ""They will advise what kind of pro gram is needed for training and retraining.  We will work directly with business and in  dustry. That will be  the strength of this  program and will make it unique.""  He said that 39 of the top corporate chief  executives that are part of the Cleveland  Tomorrow campaign are working with the  college to develop a technical training pro gram that relates to state-of-the -art manu facturing opportunities.  ""The keynote of the center will be flexi bility and  responsiveness  to  the needs of  business and industry,"" said Ellison. ""The  object is to bring about a strong match be tween the needs of business and industry  and the people we will tum out.""  ""An  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Ellison said college officials also are talk ing  to Ford Motor Co., which operates a  program of training people that might come  back to the company in computer technolo gy  and other  skills  and  to  equip  those  people Ford cannot keep with skills for jobs  elsewhere.  He said Dr. Ron Zambetti, provost of the  Urban Metropolitan Development Institute,  visited Ford's training facility in Nashville,  Tenn., recently to help determine how to or ganize the CCC center. The institute is the  outreach arm of CCC responsible for devel opment of the center.  CCC  also  is working with Technicare  Corp.  to develop  tailor-made  courses de signed for  its specific occupational needs,  such as in computer repair and other areas.  Ellison said it is very difficult to guaran tee 100%  job placement  for  the center's  trainees. He emphasized that "". . . we are  going to try to close the gap between train ing and placement and make that gap as  narrow as possible because the people who  will be trained or retrained need to feel they  are being trained for jobs that exist and not  just to be trained as an end in itself.""  He said  the center would contain a  re source support system for small businesses  that should have a  tremendous impact on  this group.  The business community will be involved  not only in helping to develop the curricu lum but in selecting the chief executive offi cer for the center and its staff, said Ellison.  ""We think staffing will have some unique  characteristics. We will seek some of the top  people  in  business  and  industry  to  get  skilled craftsmen brought into our teaching  and training corps.  ""We will  look  for  industry-experienced  people with less theory and more applica tion.""  The center will be designed  to provide  work-force  education  and  training  in  modem, applied high technologies through  hands-on  use  of  industry-specific  equip ment, machinery and laboratories.  Training and retraining will be for jobs in  high growth industries such as energy and  instrumentation technologies and electronic  and mechanical technologies.  More  than  26,000  square  feet  of  the  96,000-square-foot facility will be devoted to  applied skills training for private industry.  Lecture and laboratory instruction will in clude energy and instrumentation technol ogies with courses such as solar energy, fuel  cells, helium gas turbines, fusions, metrolo gy and computerized energy monitoring.  Instruction in electronic technologies will  encompass courses in microcomputer hard ware, microprocessor  technologies,  satel lites, video discs, videotex, optical fibers and  laser technology.  Mechanical technologies will focus on ma chining in industry, especially computer-as sisted manufacturing, machine maintenance  and repair and tool-and-die training.  It also will include metal fabrication, weld ing production, plastics, electromechanical fluidal-thermalpneumatics training and ro botization  in manufacturing allied health  applications.  Trainees will have full use of the Metro  Campus services, such as career planning  and placement.  ""We will not necessarily  link  their <the  students> training to college degrees, but we  hope to be able to link credit and noncredit  opportunities,"" Ellison said.  He said the center would be run on a 12month program basis and he hopes  that  contracts with businesses and industries will  help pay for the larger part of the tuitions.  7423  Class scheduling specifications call for of fering  four different options:  accelerated  full-time (eight hours per day,  three days  per week>; regular full-time <four hours per  day, five days per week);  limited full-time  <eight hours per day,  two days per week>;  part-time <three hours per evening,  four  evenings per week>.   TRIBUTE TO ""UNIONIST OF THE  YEAR"": JOHN BIGELOW  HON. FORTNEY H. (PETE) STARK  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 2, 1984  ",1984
357,147,6,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, on March  30th, the Central Labor Council of Al ameda County, AFL-CIO,  honored  John Bigelow  as  ""Unionist  of  the  Year.""  Mr. Bigelow is being recognized for  his untiring efforts on behalf of the  labor movement and for his many civic  contributions.  In 1939,  John Bigelow  joined his  first union,  local 1114, which is now  the  Amalgamated  Transit  Union,  while working  for Greyhound  bus  lines. He left there to join the United  Brotherhood of Carpenters and Join ers Local 2116  in 1941. Transferring  from that local to Carpenters 554, he  worked in the shipyards until August  1943, when he  joined  the merchant  marine. He sailed  first as a marine  cook and steward, then as a member of  the SUP on six ships. On four of them,  he was ship's delegate  for  the deck  gang <shop steward).  When he  left  the sea  in January  1946, John went to work for the Amer ican Can Co., where he  joined  the  United Steel Workers Union, Local  1798. He was vice president of  that  union from 1947-49. When the Steel workers issued a new charter for the  American Can plant, Bigelow became  a charter member of that local and  served as its chief steward for 12 years.  When John Bigelow joined the Ash land  fire department  in 1961,  there  were no organized firefighters south  or east of San Leandro. Shortly after  his arrival, he helped organize and get  a charter from the International Asso ciation of Firefighters. He was  the  local's  first president and  served 8  years in that capacity. On retiring in  1977, he was honored by receiving the  first lifetime membership ever award ed by that membership. John's leader ship in organizing the firefighters in  Ashland not only provided benefits to  his fell ow employees, but he was  in strumental in establishing charters in  many other surrounding cities in Ala meda County.  Very  early  in his union  activity,  John  recognized  the  importance of  labor councils. He was a delegate  to  the CIO Council from 1946 until the  merger of the two councils, becoming  ",1984
358,186,6,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, the labor  advisers' case is one in which we must  be  especially concerned because,  as  with the case surrounding the murders  of the four American churchwomen,  American citizens were  involved. But  at the same time we cannot lose sight  of the thousands of other innocent vic tims whose deaths have gone unan swered. There have been no  trials.  There has not been one conviction.  Mr. President, let me just say in con clusion, as to the case being made by  the Senator from Massachusetts with  his amendment, I think it is important  that our colleagues realize here that  this amendment is merely an expres sion on the part of this body to try  and bring some sanity in that country,  and I only wish it would. I am not op timistic about it, given the recent past  events.  My only hope would be as we get  sometimes, I think, caught up in deal ing with specific amendments, we do  not lose sight of the larger picture and  the larger issue which is at stake here,  and that is ultimately whether or not  the Government of El Salvador  is  going to take the necessary steps to re build confidence  in  its own country  and to get about the business of trying  to bring an end to that violence and to  the war in that nation so that it can be  at least a safe environment for eco nomic aid and assistance.  And it seems too often we get to ar guing numbers here rather than the  overall broad policy questions. I sus pect that is what we are sort of caught  up in a bit this week, that we are going  to lose sight of the forest for the trees  in some way.  But this amendment I think will give  this body at least a chance to express  itself to some degree of consistency on  the issue of the death squads as they  pertain particularly to two Americans  and one Salvadoran. By the way, there  was an El Salvadoran, who was assassi nated that evening as well along with  Mr. Pearlman, Mr. Hammer. Mr. Jose  Rodolfo Viera, who was director of El  Salvador's land reform program, was  also murdered  that evening  in  the  hotel.  It just might send, in addition to the  other signals as, we call them, an indi cation of where  this body stands at  least on this issue, if not on the issue  of  continuation  of  the  conflict  in  combat and the likelihood of U.S. mili tary  involvement  in  a  direct way.  Maybe this will help.  So for that reason, Mr. President, I  will support this amendment.  I yield.  ",1984
359,186,6,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I am  voting in favor of tabling this amend ment because I believe it significantly  diffuses  the focus of attention from  the efforts to limit 30 percent of the  funding for El Salvador until there is  a verdict on the national guardsmen  who are defendants in the case involv ing the four U.S. churchwomen. On  the  fiscal  year  1984  appropriations  bill, I added such an amendment limit ing 30 percent of an appropriation of  approximately $64 million until there  was a verdict in that case. Representa tives of  the U.S. State Department  and members of the Salvadoran Gov ernment concede that the 30 percent  limitation has been effective in push ing the nuns' case ahead for trial.  The case  involved  in  this amend ment, known as the Sheraton murder  case, involves much more complicated  issues of  law. For example,  the  two  gunmen cannot testify against the key  prospective military  defendant  be cause of Salvadoran law which prohib its one coconspirator testifying against  another  coconspirator.  Under  our  principles of law, such a coconspirator  can testify against another coconspira tor.  The so-called Sheraton case is now  on appeal from one El Salvadoran ap pellate court to a higher El Salvador an appellate court. All factors consid ered, the procedural snarl and the dif ferences  in  law make  the  so-called  Sheraton military case a much more  difficult case to use to impose condi tionality on U.S. aid to El Salvador.  It is my  judgment, that the nuns'  case has the best chance of motivating  the El Salvadoran judicial system and  that the source of attention should  remain on that case for the reasons I  have discussed.  ",1984
360,186,6,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I have  no further need for time and I am pre pared to yield back the remainder of  my time.  I wonder if the Senator from Con necticut on behalf of the Senator from  Massachusetts will yield back the re mainder of the time.  ",1984

393,199,6,Mr. KASTEN., I yield 10 minutes to  the Senator  from  Pennsylvania  to  speak in opposition to the amendent.  ,1984
394,199,6,Mr. SPECTER.," I  thank the distin guished chairman of the subcommit tee, the Senator from Wisconsin <Mr.  KASTEN).  Madam President, it is the underly ing amendment of the Senator from  Pennsylvania which calls for the with holding of 30 percent of the $61 mil lion until there is a verdict in the case  involving the four American church women, and it is an amendment in the  second degree which seeks to cut off  all the funds until there is a verdict in  the case involving the four American  churchwomen. I am opposed to cutting  off all the funds because I believe that  that would subject the situation in El  Salvador to greater peril and a cutoff  of all  the funds  is not necessary  in  order to keep the pressure on the El  Salvadoran Government  to  try  the  case  involving  the  four American  churchwomen.  It is my sense that there has been a  case made by the administration for  emergency aid. That case has been ex pressed cogently by a number of the  Senators who have spoken on this sub ject. I  think that the analysis of the  distinguished  Senator  from Hawaii  <Mr.  INOUYE)  speaks  eloquently  to  that point, and part of the aid that he  ref erred to was the medical aid.  I think it is unwise to tie the hands  of the administration totally in limit ing any funds from going to El Salva dor until the case of the four Ameri can churchwomen have been  tried.  But that is more of a cutoff than is  necessary, in my judgment, to put the  requisite pressure on the El Salvador an judicial system to try the cases in volving  the  four American  church women. Also, as a matter of practicali ty, it is more likely that Senators who  vote on these measures would be in clined to vote for a 30-percent cutoff  than for a 100-percent cutoff.  There is a procedural issue which we  are dealing with at the moment as to a  separation of the votes on what may  be anticipated to be a motion to table  the amendment by Senator LEAHY and  Senator DODD, contrasted with the un derlying amendment which has been  offered by this Senator. But I did want  to off er that distinction between these  two positions.  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin  for yielding the time to me. I  thank  the Chair and I yield the floor.  ",1984
395,199,6,Mr. KASTEN.," Madam President, I  yield myself such time as I may re quire.  Madam President, the Senator from  Pennsylvania has worked diligently on  the issue of judicial reform in El Sal vador. He has been a tremendous asset  in the Subcommittee on Foreign Oper ations, and I am most grateful to the  Senator for all of his assistance and  for taking the lead on this issue.  Frankly,  it  is  because of Senator  SPECTER'S hard work that the Appro priations Committee on  the  regular  bill accepted a similar amendment of fered  by  the  Senator, which was  signed into law last November.  Madam President, the case is now in  the plenario stage, the final stage of  judicial proceedings in El Salvador. As  my colleagues are aware, the judicial  system in El Salvador is very different  from  ours,  in  that  once  the  case  reaches  this stage all  testimony and  evidence has been presented  to  the  judge. At this stage there will be no  new evidence, no new  testimony. All  that is left is the presentation of de fense briefs, the setting of a date cer tain for the trial, indexing of the evi dence by the judge, and finally empan eling the jury.  Madam President, I honestly believe  that Salvadoran officials have  taken  notice of the will of Congress on this  matter. There is no one here who can  condone the delay in this trial. I do be lieve that the Senator's language last  year has had a positive effect on this  case.  I believe that this is not the right  time for a  further amendment. The  Salvadoran officials working on  this  case  are  doing  their best  to wind  through the judicial system there, and  that we will soon see results.  I  feel  the same about this amend ment as a number of the other condi tionality amendments. The time for us  to work with these various conditions  is on the authorization bill and/or on  the regular appropriation bill.  At this  time,  I believe  that all of  these set-aside amendments or with holding amendments are simply delays  and/ or cuts.  I am hopeful that this  amendment will be defeated.  ",1984
396,212,6,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, I ask  the distinguished manager of the bill,  my good friend from Wisconsin who is  working so hard, if he has objection to  going off the bill and resuming routine  morning business?  ",1984
397,212,6,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, I have  no objection.  ",1984

409,251,6,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Chairman. I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of  H.R. 4706. a bill to authorize appro priations to the Maritime Administra tion for fiscal year 1985. and for other  purposes.  As has already been explained by  the chairman of  the Committee on  Merchant Marine and Fisheries,  the  gentleman from North Carolina. H.R.  4706 authorizes a total of $468.6 mil lion for MARAD's programs in fiscal  year 1985. a total which is $8.077 mil lion above that requested by the ad ministration. I know of no significant  opposition to the bill as it is before us  today.  although  the  administration  has indicated it will seek reductions to taling $8 million as  the authorizing  legislation works its way through the  other body.  I might comment briefly on one area  of concern to the administration: The  authorization in this bill for an addi tional $5 million to be made available  for the conversion of the Massachu setts  Marine  Academy's  training  vessel.  I  remain  unconvinced  that  those  moneys. in addition to the $5.8 million  carryover funds budgeted by the ad ministration for the conversion work.  are absolutely essential  in order  to  make  the vessel a  suitable  training  platform. I must say that we have seen  nothing in the way of hard data to  refute the claimed need for additional  funds. I understand that a reliable es timate of the funds required will not  be available until the actual plans and  specifications for  the conversion are  formulated and bids solicited and re ceived. That may not occur until at  least July 1 of this year. making it  the Santa Mercedes. While  questionable whether that additional  data will be available in time to assist  our colleagues on the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Commerce. Justice.  State. and Judiciary in putting togeth er their numbers for the Maritime Ad ministration for fiscal year 1985. So.  what we are faced with is the authori zation and possible appropriation of  funds which no one can say with any  certainty are sufficient. insufficient. or  more than sufficient to accomplish the  intended purpose.  Members will note that this MarAd  authorization bill is remarkably bare  bones compared  to  its most  recent  predecessors. which have been laden  with substantive  legislation of such  controversy  and  disagreement  that  there has been no independently en acted authorization for the last 3 fiscal  years. The noncontroversial nature of  this legislation did not develop by acci dent. Mr. Chairman. and I compliment  the gentleman from New York.  the  subcommittee chairman.  for his  re solve in seeing to it that we have a bill  before us which can be enacted into  law.  Because  the  committee  has  not  loaded  up  this  authorization with  major policy-type provisions. there is  some indication that the Subcommit tee on Merchant Marine and the full  committee will attempt to move sub stantive legislation yet during this ses sion.  including some sort of separate  funding authorization  in support of  the domestic shipyards by the May 15  reporting deadline. The committee's  views  and  estimates.  adopted  on  March 14. have provided for such a  separate initiative.  Mr. Chairman. I urge the Members  to support H.R. 4706. the MarAd au thorization bill.  I am confident that  our swift action will  lead to similar  consideration in the other body and  that differences. if any. can be easily  resolved in conference.  Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr.  Chairman.  I yield 2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts <Mr.  STUDDS).  Mercedes,  ",1984
410,251,6,Mr. STUDDS.,"  I  thank the gentle man for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of the MarAd authorization bill. I  am especially pleased that the legisla tion includes $5 million to be used in  conversion of the cargo ship. Santa  to a training vessel for the  Massachusetts Maritime Academy.

In recent years, the school has  been  forced  to borrow a  ship  from  either the Maine or New York acade mies. an arrangement that has created  large  administrative  problems  and  worked  to  the detriment of all stu dents involved.  in  In fiscal year 1983. Congress author ized and appropriated some $10 mil lion for MarAd to either repair or re place the Bay State. I am pleased that  the Santa Mercedes has now been pur chased for  this purpose. However.  I  am concerned  that Mar Ad does not  have adequate funds available to carry  out the needed conversion. Approxi mately $5.8 million remains from the  $10 million already made available by  the Congress. but this is clearly insuf ficient to do the job right. MarAd and  I say this in respone to the observa tions of  the gentleman  from Ken tucky, will need at least the $5 million  made available by this bill to provide  the academy with the facility that its  students deserve and require.  The gentleman  is correct  that no  one can say with certainty at  this  point what the final bill will be. but I  think  if anything  is certain  this  world it is that this will not cover it.  I also want to take this opportunity  to. on behalf of the faculty and stu dents of the Massachusetts Maritime  Academy. thank the gentleman from  New York <Mr. BIAGGI). the chairman  of the subcommittee. for his efforts.  As he well knows. what we do with re spect to the determination of the ade quacy of conversion of this vessel will  set a precedent for conversions of ves sels still to come. presumably for the  remaining academies. one of which. as  the gentleman well knows.  is  in the  State of New York.

421,277,6,Mr. ECKART.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, it has always been a  fundamental principle, I  suppose, of  our free enterprise system that Gov ernment should allow economic forces  to play as freely as possible through a  complex and diverse economy. It has  also been fundamental to Government  activities, when intervention is neces sary, that that intervention be based  principally on the theory of a free and  open economic market. For instance,  regulation deems to be a substitute for  competition or a monopoly is awarded,  such as in the areas of public utilities.  We have been called upon  in  the  past often to intervene for purposes of  remembering that our power to act is  and  really  always must be  closely  linked to the responsibility of Govern ment to act in the broader interests of  the majority of our citizens.  Essentially, the Government should  intervene in the affairs of private en terprise only in those very narrow in stances when the larger population is  adversely affected, when the national  interests, particularly as it may relate  to our Nation's defense, are hindered.  It may come as a shock to some, but  I am not prepared in the course of this  special order today to argue that big is  necessarily bad.  I am concerned, however, about the  recent trends toward the accumulation  of wealth in corporate America. Just  about 20 years ago, 400 of our Nation's  largest  corporations  controlled  two thirds  of  the  Nation's  corporate  wealth,  and now,  just  two decades  later,  the centralization has resulted  in  just 200  corporations controlling  almost 70 percent of this Nation's cor porate economic wealth.  Now we are confronted with a new  merger mania involving oil companies,  which is a spinoff of what took place  just 2112 years ago.  In February the FTC saw nothing  wrong with Texaco's $10.0 billion ac quisition of Getty Oil. Yet we can ask  how many  jobs were  created, how  many barrels of oil produced, how  much  economic  activity  stimulated  with that acquisition.  The Reagan  administration,  from  my perspective, has turned a blind eye  toward this and in fact they encourage  this  form of corporate  cannibalism  without any regard to the efficiencies  both  of  a management  or  capital  nature that may result.  Our energy industry is critical to the  economic revitalization of this Nation.  We cannot stand idly by and allow it  to go the path of other industries that  find  themselves  in  dire  economic  straits. However, if the consumers of  our  petrochemical  products  a.re  to  truly benefit, and we have  to make  sure that the economies a.re sea.led to  which mergers seem to promote, actu ally will give greater choice to us in  yea.rs a.head.  We  cannot witness  oil  companies  ta.king money that they have garnered  from  the decontrol of oil passed by  this House and accelerated by this ad ministration, and  instead of plowing  those profits back into capitalization  of other industries, spread it out into  nonproductive uses and in effect deny ing opportunities to capitally deprived  industries to grow.  These actions could ultimately prove  to be detrimental  to our economic  growth. And the prospect of increasing  concentration in an already dominant  oil industry of a few mega.giants may  not be  in  the best  interests of  the  public nor in the long-term economic  interests of this nation.  We cannot allow this administration  to continue to lead us down a yellow  brick road of economic recovery where  in every instance bigger is better. The  result  is  less competition, more mo nopolies.  But in enforcing a meaningful anti trust policy, I think we have to look at  what ought those standards to be. As  my friend from New York said, origi nal trust busting that went on in these  Halls almost 90 years ago was directly  and properly intended to diversify and  to give greater responsibility  to  the  public through the merger acquisition  process. Those  times have  changed  dramatically. I think we have to look  at the whole merger acquisition ques tion with three new central ideas:  First, in the merger that is contem plated, what new access to ca.pita.I or  cash flow will the merged companies  now have? Second, what impact will it  have not only on the domestic market  here  in  the United States but  the  international market as well, because  we are truly an international econo my? And third, what new efficiencies  to both management and operation  may result that will enhance an eco nomic entity's ability to be more pro ductive?  I think that a. reasonable argument  can be ma.de that the Justice Depart ment and the FTC have focused too  narrowly in recent decisions only on  the  impact of U.S. markets. They  failed  to  take  into account external  considerations such as  the changing  and more competitive global economy  and  the unf a.ir practices of  foreign  competitors.  As my friend from New York point ed out, you get the Justice Depart ment and the FTC considering similar  complaints from similar industries of  unf a.ir and illegal dumping practices,  denying to them economic opportuni ties in the United States, and at the  same time slamming the door on the  way for them to get out of those diffi cult economic  circumstances at  the  same time.  This merger  that we had dealing  particularly with Republic Steel and  LTV should in fact, if tested against  the three different principles of access  to capital and cash flow, international  ",1984
422,290,6,Mr. CORRADA.," Let me point out to  the gentleman, some people think that  we Hispanics want to force upon Eng lish-speaking people  in our country  Spanish or any other  foreign  lan guage. We do not want to do that. We  understand that English  is  the  lan guage of  this country, what people  speak  in business,  in school,  in  the  social environment, and so on.  What we want  is our children  to  have the opportunity of learning Eng lish in a way that is done so that the  children do not turn away from the  classroom.  Furthermore, of course, we are very  proud of our Hispanic heritage, of our  culture, but within a concept of cultur al pluralism that exists and enriches  the life of this Nation.  There is no divisiveness or sense of  separation by Hispanics, for instance,  when we speak Spanish in our homes,  or in the subway or anywhere else. I  think that what would keep Hispanics  separated or any other language mi nority is to deny them equal education  opportunities by keeping them away  from  the educational system by not  providing  something  like  bilingual  education. Just as I believe that not  bringing Hispanics  into the electoral  process, into the political process, by  having such provisions as the Voting  Rights Act, which provides that mate rial will be furnished both in English,  as well as any other language, where 5  percent or more of the population be longs to a language minority.  Well,  if these people by better un derstanding  in  their  own  language  what democracy is all about, what the  political process is all about, go and  register to vote, participate in the po litical process, we are bringing them  into the mainstream of American poli tics, rather then keeping them away.  Mr. Speaker, the right of language mt1ority students to special  instruc tional services is also protected by the  Equal Educational Opportunities Act  of 1974. Section 204(f} of this Federal  statute makes it illegal for an educa tional agency to fail to ""take appropri ate action to overcome language bar riers that impede equal participation  by its students in its instructional pro gram.""  The Bilingual Education Act is the  only  Federal mechanism  in  place  today to assist State and local educa tion agencies in the capacity-building  activities they must undertake to ful fill their obligations under these Fed eral civil rights statutes. Contrary to  what  I  have heard  from many  so called experts, I believe that expendi tures for bilingual education programs  will help  to decrease  future budget  deficits. In fiscal  terms, it is self-de feating  to  reduce  expenditures  for  vital and effective education programs  such as  title VII. Language-minority  students need bilingual education pro grams  to succeed  in school and  to  become economically productive mem bers of our society.  Without a specific bilingual educa tion program to address their needs,  countless  language-minority students  would drop out of school. Most of the  language-minority students who con tinue in school would graduate with out the skills they need for survival in  our increasingly competitive economy.  This, in tum, would deprive the Feder al Government of future tax revenues  and, at the same time, increase future  Federal outlays for public assistance  and unemployment compensation.  0 1640  Bilingual education  is an effective  method  for  inculcating  the English  language skills language-minority stu dents need for academic success. Fur thermore, it addresses the educational  needs of a growing population whose  labor market  difficulties  are more  severe than those of other groups. The  roots of disproportionate employment  figures are not clear cut, but a recent  study by the National Commission for  Employment Policy stated that ""a lack  of  fluency  in English  is  the major  source of  the  labor market difficul ties""  faced  by Hispanics. For  this  reason, bilingual education  takes on  central importance for the economic  future of our people.  I would also note that bilingual edu cation can be used to serve the Na tion's  international  interests.  Al though the primary purpose of title  VII is to insure that language-minority  students receive equal educational op portunities, bilingual education pro grams also preserve and expand our  Nation's  inadequate  linguistic  re sources. ThiS year, the House of Rep resentatives passed legislation to pro mote national security and economic  growth through foreign language im provement. During  the hearings on  this bill, military leaders, intelligence  officials, and corporation directors tes tified that America's shortage of bilin gual personnel  jeopardized  the suc cessful conduct of foreign affairs and  international trade. The Department  of Defense,  for  example, presented  statistics which showed that in 1980 it  was able to fill only 58 percent of the  DOD positions which required fluency  in Spanish. Bilingual education can be  a useful tool in correcting our current  linguistic deficiencies, and  improving  the Nation's capabilities in maintain ing a strong defense, effective diplo macy,  and meaningful  international  trade.  Mr. Speaker, this year the Congress  must reauthorize the Bilingual Educa tion Act. As a member of the Elemen tary, Secondary and Vocational Educa tion Subcommittee of the Education  and Labor Committee, I have joined 50  of my colleagues in introducing H.R.  5231, the Academic Equity and Excel lence Through Bilingual Education  Act of 1984. I am very pleased with the  improvements this bill represents, as  could be ascertained from the testimo ny we  heard  during  hearings  last  week. This bill represents a consensus  between groups representing the lan guage minority populations, such as  the National Association for Bilingual  Education, the National Council of La  Raza,  the League  of United Latin  American Citizens, the Mexican-Amer ican Legal Defense & Education Fund,  the  Joint National Commission  on  Languages,  the National Association  for Asian Pacific American Education,  and the National Congress of Ameri can Indians.  Mr. Speaker, at  this point  I will  insert a brief summary of the provi sions of H.R. 5231:  SUMMARY OF MAJOR FEATURES: DRAFT BILIN GUAL EDUCATION REAUTHORIZATION BILL  Authorization Level: For the purposes of  carrying out the provisions of the act, there  are  authorized  to  be  appropriated  $400,000,000  for  fiscal  year  1985;  $450,000,000  for  fiscal  year  1986;  $500,000,000 for fiscal year 1987, and such  suins as may be necessary for each of the  four succeeding  fiscal years. Additionally,  there is a separate authorization for grants  to State Education Agencies <SEAs> under  this title. For SEA grants $24,000,000 is au thorized for fiscal year 1985; $28,000,000 for  fiscal year 1986; $32,000,000 for fi~cal year  1987, and such suins as may be necessary for  each of the four succeeding fiscal years. The  1985 authorizations are  the same as  the  1983 authorization figures for this program  prior to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation  Act.  Length of Authorization: This legislation  reauthorizes Title VII, the Bilingual Educa tion Act,  from  fiscal year 1985  through  fiscal year 1991.  PART A: FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR BILINGUAL  EDUCATION PROGRAMS  Sixty percent of the funds available under  this act are reserved for programs funded  under this part. The legislation would au thorize bilingual program grants in the fol lowing categories:  Transitional  Bilingual  Education  Pro grams. These programs  are  designed  to  serve limited English proficient <LEP> chil dren, although up to 40% of the children in  the program may be non-LEP for integra tion  purposes. The  programs  require  a  structured  English-language  component,  and to the extent necessary, instruction in  the child's native language. Programs must  be designed so that children can meet pro motion  and  graduation  requirements.  Grants are for three years, and are renew able for an additional two years. The first  six months of the grant is to be used for  training, planning and other pre-service ac tivities <a waiver may be provided for dis tricts where such activities are not neces sary>.  Language Development Programs. These  programs are designed to allow all partici pating children  to achieve competence  in  English and a second language, and meet  promotion  and  graduation  requirements.  The programs are to be composed of ap proximately equal number of LEP and non LEP children <although a waiver may be  granted where this is not feasible). Grants  are for three years, and are renewable for  ",1984
423,303,6,Mr. PEPPER.," Let me share with my  friend what concerns me so deeply  about what the President said. Prior  to the effort and the action of our  no  joint  commission,  young people  all  over  this country were very bitter.  Many of them said to me from time to  time, ""All you all are doing is ripping  us off with this social security system  that you have got. When we get out  there, eligible to receive any benefits,  either there won't be any social securi ty  system  or  there won't be  any  money.""  ",1984

425,303,6,Mr. PEPPER.," Wait just a minute. I  tried to allay the fears of these young  people. But until our joint commission  issued its report and it was adopted by  the Congress and the President made  the strong statement that he did, and  here  in his  language, and Congress  made the strong statement that it did,  I noticed immediately a great differ ence  in  the attitude of  the young  people.  They would walk up to me in the air ports around over the country and say:  ""We want to thank you all for what  you are doing for social security."" We  had restored their faith in the social  security system.  ",1984
426,303,6,Mr. CONABLE., And properly so.  ,1984
427,303,6,Mr. PEPPER.," We were so proud of  it. I never dreamed that I would wit ness what I saw yesterday afternoon  when I heard two Democrats here in  this House talking about wanting to  institute 2-percent cut in social securi ty as part of the budget. I got up and  upbraided them. I said, ""You do not  know what you are talking about. We  made  a moral  commitment  to  the  people of this country.""  ",1984
428,303,6,Mr. CONABLE., Right on.  ,1984
429,303,6,Mr. PEPPER.," They want to tear it  up.  I  cannot believe  that  the young  people will not be shocked when the  President says that: ""all I am saying is  we are going to keep the system sound  for the people that are now receiving  their checks; but we are not making  any commitment for anybody who has  not yet started to receive a check.""  I wish  the President had not said  that, and would have stood on his own  earlier statement and let the commit ment that we made not be impeached  or impaired by any remark he might  make.  ",1984
430,303,6,Mr. CONABLE.,"  If the gentleman  will yield for one further moment. I  hope the statement of the President of  the United States will be permitted to  stand as it was and will not be inter preted  in ways that would engender  additional  fears  among people who  have already feared  too much about  this system which means so much to  the gentleman from Florida, so much  to me, so much to the young people as  well as the old people of this country.  We have a right to a little tranquil  possession of the system as it is.

433,303,6,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, in the  last few weeks my subcommittee has  held hearings on mergers and  joint  ventures in the oil  industry and the  automobile industry. I have come out  of those hearings even more troubled  than before, and I am pleased to have  the opportunity to explain why.  When I introduced H.R. 5153 to es tablish a moratorium on mergers,  I  said the current unprecedented wave  of megamergers  raises a number of  urgent questions.  Are we watching  the  energy  life  blood of our industrial might dripping  away  as  talent  and  resources  are  poured  into  financial manipulation  and the search for ever greater tax ad vantages? As tens of billions of dollars  are tied up in merger battles and com panies are mortgaged in the parry and  thrust of takeover struggles, are we al lowing a process that is destroying the  incentive to explore for oil, distorting  capital markets, and pushing up inter est rates? Are we permitting a rising  concentration of crude resources in a  few hands so that in a moment of for eign crisis and oil cutoff, military and  foreign policy options could be jeop ardized? And where in all this are the  antitrust  enforcement  agencies?  they view  the oil  industry as suffi ciently decentralized that mergers do  not trigger antitrust enforcement,  is  there something wrong with the anti trust laws, or with enforcement, or is  something required that goes beyond  antitrust?

434,342,6,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, on behalf  of myself, Mr. FORD of Tennessee, Mr.  FOWLER, Mr. MATSUI, and Mrs. KEN NELLY,  I  am  today  introducing  the  Supplemental Security Income-SSI Equitable Improvements and Reform  Amendments  of  1984.  I  am  also  pleased  to  announce  that Senator  Moynihan will  be  introducing  the  same bill on the Senate side. This leg islation will make  the SSI program  more manageable, more effective and  better able to serve the needy aged,  blind, and disabled. A major goal of  this bill is to improve the present un realistic standards and administration  of the program that now impede the  efficacy, access and above all fairness  of the SSI program.  On the 10th anniversary of the SSI  program, it seems appropriate to com pare the program's performance with  its original goals and expectations. SSI  began in January 1974 as a federally  funded means tested income assistance  program authorized by  title XVI of  the Social Security Act. It is 100 per cent federally funded. Its main objec tive  is  to provide basic support  to  needy aged, blind and disabled individ uals who meet nationwide eligibility  requirements.  Unfortuately,  Mr.  Speaker,  as  former chairman of the Public Assist ance and Unemployment Compensa tion Subcommittee, and now ranking  member, I have watched the SSI pro gram  in  the past few years become  needlessly complex and rigid and have  seen  negative,  unintended  conse quences of current  law hinder  the  original objectives. Likewise,  certain  provisions have not kept pace with in flation. My bill does not propose com prehensive welfare  reform, although  that certainly would be a worthy goal.  Nor does it try to correct all of the in equities  in  the program.  Instead,  it  takes incremental-but no less impor tant-steps toward a fairer, more re sponsive, and more manageable SSI  program. These are steps I believe we  must take if we are interested in re ducing the ""meanness factor"" which  has crept into the program for present  beneficiaries. Also, the resource limits  need  to be  adjusted  so  that  truly  needy aged, blind, and disabled indi viduals will become eligible. My legis lation contains several proposals that  lead us in this direction.  First, it would correct some unfair  consequences of current SSI  law by  not counting gifts or small  inherit ances as income in a month, if in the  following month  they would be ex cluded as resources. Present law inhib its the normal kind of gift giving and  inheritance practices between family  members and friends. When the Social  Security  Administration  learns  of  these  gifts  and  inherited  items,  it  counts them as income which results  in the reduction of benefits for the  month, even though the items will not  be converted into cash and will become  excluded  resources  the  following  month. This has been an extremely  harsh provision which has unfairly re duced benefits even though the person  could not use the item in question to  meet normal living expenses.  This  bill would  correct  another  unfair consequence of current law by  allowing SSI  recipients who  receive  ",1984
435,355,6,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  proud and honored to once again par ticipate in the Congressional Call to  Conscience Vigil For Soviet Jewry, and  I  thank the distinguished gentleman  from Pennsylvania, Mr. COUGHLIN, for  organizing this effort. I believe that,  as Members of this body, we must con tinue  to  take every opportunity  to  speak out against the flagrant denial  of basic human rights in the Soviet  Union.  Mr. Speaker, conditions in the Soviet  Union have been deteriorating at a  rapid rate for those of Jewish faith.  Not only is emigration at an alltime  low, with a mere 1,218 Jewish people  allowed to leave in 1983 compared to  the almost 51,000 allowed to leave in  1979, but reports of widespread har rassment and oppression are on the in crease. the anti-Semitic policies of the  Soviet Government have made  the  daily existence of many Soviet Jews a  difficult,  frustrating  and  seemingly  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dis hopeless,  struggle  for  survival. The  fundamental freedom to learn about,  and take pride in, one's culture, histo ry and religion is denied to the Soviet  Jewish citizen. Individuals who openly  attempt to develop their Jewish identi ty are sure to encounter various forms  of intimidation and persecution. The  desire on the part of Soviet Jews to  escape this persecution through emi gration  is  considered  a  punishable  crime.  A tragic case in point is that of 23year-old Aleksandra Lein. Aleksandra,  daughter of former prisoner of con science, Evgeny Lein, applied for per mission to emigrate with her family in  April 1978. Permission was refused to  the Lein family in August of that year  on grounds of ""secrecy."" Since that  time, additional applicants to emigrate  have been repeatedly and systemati cally denied. The Leins, Aleksandra in cluded, are well known among the Re fuseniks since they study Hebrew and  Jewish culture and history. This labels  them as ""activisits"" in the lexicon of  the Soviet regime.  Shortly after Aleksandra's first ap plication  to  emigrate,  she was  missed from the night institute where  she took classes. Later, she had the  frightening  and  humiliating  experi ence of being assaulted in the street.  The police did everything possible to  avoid presssing charges against her at tackers. Finally, this past January, a  few short months before she was to  marry, Aleksandra was fired from her  job as a computer operator. Aleksan dra's dismissal  coincided with  the  firing of six other prominent Refuse niks-a further attempt to harrass the  Jewish  community  as part of  the  Soviet leadership's intensified anti-Se mitic campaign.  Aleksandra, a  spirited and strong willed young woman, took the issue to  court, hoping to have her job reinstat ed. Her  employer  testified on her  behalf. He told the court that she was  an  excellent  employee-knowledgea ble,  skillful,  and  responsible.  The  court, however, chose to rule against  Aleksandra, and  for  the  first  time,  publicly stated that ""those who apply  to emigrate will be the first to go in  cases of staff reduction.""  Although Aleksandra  is  preparing  another court appeal, her experience  demonstrates in a clearer fashion than  usual  that anti-Semitic policies  are  rampant. Aleksandra, and others like  her, must be admired for their bravery  as well as their ability to persevere in  the face of discrimination, economic  hardship,  and  even physical  abuse.  However, they are counting on our ef forts  to bring hope for their future.  We cannot let them down. I urge each  of my colleagues  to work not only  toward increased emigration for Soviet  Jews, but toward freedom and justice  for those who, for one reason or an other, remain in the Soviet Union.e  7631  PROTECT AMERICAN PRODUCTS  FROM COUNTERFEITERS  HON.THOMASJ.DOWNEY  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 3, 1984  e Mr. DOWNEY of New York. Mr.  Speaker, in the final hours of the first  session I introduced H.R. 4502, legisla tion which uses special trade pref er ences as  a  lever  to  stop  industrial  counterfeiting  by  developing  coun tries.  Today,  along with 14 of my col leagues, I am introducing a bill which  makes  several  improvements  to  the  original. Most importantly, it affords  the  same  protection  for  published  products as the first bill provided for  manufactured goods, and therefore it  has  the  expanded  backing  of  the  American publishing  industry. Addi tionally,  this new bill uses  language  similar to that already enacted as part  the Caribbean Basin  Initiative,  lan guage proved successful in halting the  pirating of textbooks in the Domini can Republic and of cable  television  signals by Jamaica. Finally, this new  bill is very similar to a bill working its  way through the Senate.  Industrial counterfeiting by foreign  nationals is a serious and growing eco nomic problem for us. A recent Inter national Trade Commission study esti mated that American companies are  losing from $6  to $8 billion in sales  each year and at least 131,000 jobs.  Many  counterfeit  goods  are  sold  abroad, cutting into needed markets  for American goods. A wide variety of  products are popular targets including  clothing, precision tools, drugs, farm  chemicals, and high technology equip ment to name a few.  While the impact on our American  manufacturers is clear, there is little  they can do legally. This bill attempts  to solve  the problem at  its source.  Under the generalized system of pref erences <GSP>. certain countries such  as Taiwan, Brazil, and South Korea  qualify for duty-free tariff treatment  in import dealings with our country in  order to promote their economic devel opment. This program has been bene ficial to the countries known to be the  source of the most notorious counter feiters. The  bill  I  am  introducing  today ties future GSP benefits to the  willingness of each country to enact  and enforce stricter laws protecting in tellectual property rights. The GSP is  due to be renewed before the end of  the year and I intend to add this bill  as an amendment.  I  invite my col leagues' support and ask that a copy  of the new version be printed here:  Section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974 <19  U.S.C. 2462) is amended< 1 > by striking out ""and"" at the end of  subsection <b><6>;  ",1984
436,368,6,Mr. RODINO.," Mr. Speaker, I  take  this opportunity to call the attention  of my colleagues to a very special pro gram in my district that allows young  people to learn a very special skill, one  that we all dream about-flying.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Rev. Russell R. White is the man re sponsible for bringing about this pro gram. He is pastor of the Bethel Bap tist Church in Orange, N.J., and also  has the distinction of being command er of the Eagle Flight Aviation Post  No. 290. For 9 years he has been an in spiration and a  teacher for many of  our young people, conducting an out. standing  flight  training  school. On  Saturday, April 7,  the Eagle Flight  Aviation Explorer's Dinner will  be  held at East Orange High School, hon oring the students who will be grad uating. The dinner will also include an  awards program.  It was a great privilege for me  to  nominate three of the school's gradu ates to the U.S. Air Force Academy in  Colorado  Springs-Doug  Williams,  James Allen, and David Dansby, all of  East Orange, N.J.  I  salute  the  following  individuals  who will be given merit awards on Sat urday night for their contributions to  the school, including: Albert Parisi, a  staff writer for the New York Times;  State  Assemblywoman  Mildred  Garvin; State Senator Richard Codey;  Essex County Executive Peter Sha piro; and Raymond Williams, presi dent of the greater New York chapter  of the Tuskegee Airmen.  The  following  people will  receive  service awards for their contributions  to the school: Jerome Lee, chief of op erations of Tri-State Airline and also a  flight instructor at the school; Irving  Carter, a captain for Tri-State Airline  and a  former Eagle Flight Explorer;  James Harrison, a captain for Great  Lakes Airlines and an Eagle Flight in structor;  Adonis  Dickerson,  Eagle  Flight Ground School instructor and  engineer for Singer Keerf ott; and Mrs.  Ida Woody of Woody's Funeral Home  in Orange, N.J.  The mistress of ceremonies for Sat urday's event will be Connie Wood ruff, and  the guest speaker will be  Mrs. Arlene Feldman, director of aero nautics for  the New Jersey Depart ment of Transportation.  There  are many  people  involved  with the Eagle Flight Aviation Post  who  deserve  recognition,  including:  Mrs. Marilyn Lewis, president of the  Parents Committee; Mrs. Justin Cong leton, associate adviser; Robert Black man, also associate adviser; Paul Bey,  police officer in East Orange and an  associate adviser; Mrs. E. Barbour of  the Parents Committee; and James  Young,  meteorologist  and  ground  school instructor.  But most important, I salute Rever end White. Were it not for his efforts,  the Eagle Flight Aviation Post No. 290  would not exist. His impact on count less young people has been  tremen dous. Reverend White has  received  widespread  recognition  for his out standing leadership  in this area. He  enjoys the esteem and respect of the  entire community, and I am proud to  April 3, 1984  count myself among his admirers. We  all owe him a great deal, particularly  the young people whom he has  in spired with dreams of conquering the  sky-and helped to develop the skills  needed to achieve that goal.e  VOICE OF DEMOCRACY  CONTEST  HON. MICHAEL D. BARNES  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 3, 1984  ",1984
437,368,6,Mr. BARNES.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to take this opportunity to pay  tribute to Miss Jean Mackin, an out standing citizen from Potomac, Md.  Miss Mackin has the honor of writ ing the winning speech in the Voice of  Democracy contest sponsored by the  U.S. Veterans of Foreign Wars and its  Ladies Auxiliary. Over 300,000 second ary students participated in the con test and I am proud that a constituent  of mine is the prestigious winner.  With students like Miss Mackin we  should be proud of the generation of  students who will some day become  the new leaders of the United States.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to share  with my colleagues this prize winning  speech and hope they enjoy it as much  as I did.  The speech follows:  MY ROLE IN UPHOLDING OUR CONSTITUTION  America . . . just the sound of the word  makes you feel good. Maybe because Amer ica means freedom, and opportunity, and  dreams, but possibly  the greatest  thing  about America is her people. So many dif ferent people. People  from  all over  the  world come to live  in America. Some risk  their lives  to reach the freedom we have  here. And once men are here they are will ing to die to keep our country free . . . and  it's not surprising.  Freedom is so priceless a gift. To have the  freedom  to speak your will,  to reach for  your dreams, and to be who you want to be  is so distant to many countries around the  world, yet in America it is a way of life.  Each and every person has the chance at  doing what he or she really wants to do.  With  the right determination one person  can affect all humanity. Just one man or  one woman can change the world for the  rest of us. Whether that change is a benefi cial one or not.  A single person, a single mind, a single  belief can make history. Take Mother The resa or take Adolf Hitler. It does not matter  whether you are a man or a woman, wheth er you are black, or white, or oriental, one  person adds so much to the world. And, in  tum, the loss of one person can take away  so much from the world.  This past year a young girl at my school  was killed in an automobile accident. Now  she is Just another statistic, one of the thou sands of people that die every year. Her  death  is  truly a  loss  to her  family and  friends, but if a gain can be found in a loss  then life is given so much more meaning.  Maybe her death gives  us  a  stronger  reason to really live. Not Just to wake up in  the morning because you have  to, but to  ",1984

448,394,6,Mr. KENNEDY.," Madam President,  we have debated over this past week  military aid to the armed forces of El  Salvador, but we have been focusing  on only one of the U.S. assistance pro grams that has been used to support  this administration's policy in El Sal vador. That policy, no matter how you  dress it up in the trappings of elec tions and democracy,  is  a military  policy: Its aim is to def eat the Salva doran  rebels.  It  is  this misguided  policy aimed solely at a military solu tion that has kept us from seeking a  cease-fire and negotiated settlement to  the civil war in El Salvador; it is this  misguided policy  that has kept us  from putting real pressure on the mur derers, the corrupt, and the antidemo cratic  elements  in  the Salvadoran  Army and security forces, and force  their removal from power.  The point I rise to make, is one that  has been obscured by this administra tion: All of the assistance programs be tween the United States and El Salva dor have been dedicated to this mili tary policy, not just the assistance pro grams covered under the title of ""mili tary aid.""  First, let us look at the figures:  I  shall ask unanimous consent  to  have printed in the RECORD with my  remarks  a  two-page memorandum  titled ""U.S. Aid to El Salvador,"" pre pared by the staff of the Arms Control  and Foreign Policy Caucus, to which I  shall refer in this discussion of aid fig ures.  In the 4 years from fiscal year 1981  through fiscal year 1984, slightly over  $1 billion in U.S. aid was sent to El  Salvador. This is an average of $250  per citizen in a country in which the  annual average  income  is only $650.  There have been five main categories  for our aid transfers and, as the ad ministration is always quick to point  out, the largest category is not ""mili tary  aid.'' The  largest  category  is  known as ""cash transfers,"" with nearly  $400 million being provided directly to  the Government of El Salvador's Cen tral Bank. Then comes ""military aid,""  with  over  $260 million.  ""Economic  aid,"" consisting of development assist ance projects and economic support  funds not used on cash transfers,  is  the third largest category, with over  $210 million; and the smallest two cat egories are ""food for sale"" under the  title I p~ogram, nearly $125 million,  and ""food, humanitarian,"" with nearly  $30 million. I am not including in this  tabulation over $100 million in com mercial credits provided by our Com modity Credit Corporation and Hous ing Investment Guarantee program.  Now, what does  it mean, that the  largest category of aid is not ""military  aid,"" but rather is ""cash transfers""?  What does it mean, that the category  titled ""military aid"" is outnumbered 3  to 1 by the total amounts of the other  four categories of aid to El Salvador?  The administration would have us  believe that our policy in El Salvador  is not a military policy; after all, they  say, most of our aid is not military aid.  What I hope to demonstrate is that  the administration cannot hide behind  this  facade  of misleading numbers:  Our entire aid program in El Salvador,  all $1 billion of it in the past 4 years,  and all of the nearly $1 billion that  has been requested for  the next 15  months, is directed toward a military  solution to the civil war there. Each  category of aid is used in the military  effort. We are sticking our heads in  the sand if we think otherwise.  Let us start with the ""cash trans! er""  category. Nearly $400 million in direct  cash infusions into El Salvador's for eign  exchange. Do Senators  know  what  the  Salvadoran Government  does with that money, with those dol lars? It sells them! Under a special ar rangement with the U.S. Government,  the  Salvadoran  Government  sells  these dollars to Salvadoran importers  for  the local currency, colones. The  importers  then use  the  dollars  to  import goods, and every year our cash  transfers cover the Salvadoran balance  of payments deficit. Let us be perfect ly clear about this point: Without that  cash transfer, the Salvadoran Govern ment could not sustain  its present  military policy.  And Madam President, do you know  what becomes of the colones that the  Salvadoran Government raises by sell ing the dollars  to  importers? Again,  under a special arrangement with the  U.S.  Government,  the  Salvadoran  Government puts them directly  into  its budget. This is El Salvador's f eder al budget we are talking about now.  Like us, El Salvador has a  deficit.  Unlike us, El Salvador covers its defi cit with  its  aid  from  the United  States-and more.  Over 30 percent of the Salvadoran  budget come from the colones raised  by the cash transfers; and nearly 40  percent of the Salvadoran budget is  spent directly on the army, with much  of  the  remainder spent on  indirect  support.  Let us be perfectly clear about this  point: Without the colones raised by  the cash transfers; and nearly 40 per cent of the Salvadoran budget is spent  directly on the army, with much of  the remainder spent on indirect sup port.  Let us be perfectly clear about this  point: Without the colones raised by  the cash transfer, the Salvadoran Gov ernment could not sustain  its army  and its present policy of attempting to  defeat, rather than settle with, the op position. Do we really think that this  ",1984

450,407,6,Mr. LEAHY., Not at this time.  ,1984
451,407,6,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from Mississippi.  STENNIS. Mr.  President,  thank the Senator for yielding.  Mr. President, this is quite serious  business. We  all know  that.  I  ex pressed myself on this subject general ly when we had before us the proposed  amendment on Lebanon.  I was one of the sponsors of the war  powers legislation. I do not claim any  credit for getting it passed. It turned  out I was away much of the time. But  I remember the pressure to ch.l.Ilge my  position and vote against it in the end;  the same thing when the motion to  override  the  President's veto was  pending. But I was determined that  something be passed that gave a little  more meaning or a clearer meaning, if  possible, to that clause in the Consti tution that says Congress shall have  the power  to declare war. It is  the  most difficult situation that I ever got  into, trying to meet it with language.  Language is not big enough, words do  not have meaning enough  to  really  cover this subject matter.  However that may be, Mr. President,  I think we would be off base entirely  to make this much of a limitation on  the Chief Executive. We all know now,  in this atomic age,  the nuclear age,  where in a matter of minutes-it has  already been figured out how many  minutes the President would have if  he felt called upon to use those weap ons which God  forbid will ever be  used, nuclear weapons. But, like it or  not, I think we have to leave it short  of what  this  proposed  amendment  says. It says it all in good faith.  Senator LEAHY  is a very valuable  member of the Committee on Armed  Services.  I  remember he came here,  was working when he got here. Heim pressed all of us  trying  to keep up  with him. He is a fast learner and he  got us into a  lot of things. He was  working on this. But I think we have  to take the hard part along with the  rest.  I am concerned about this pt.rt of  the world. I was against the Lebanon  venture, but we cannot be silent and  inactive about Central America, as I  see it. It is right here on our doorstep.  Mr. President,  I  am compelled  to  oppose the amendment for the reasons  that I have already given and I believe  we must not try to get it off our minds  or try to  ignore the subject or just  hope for the best, but I do not believe  we can have two standards about this  delicate subject.  Any President, whoever he may be,  and I personally saw three of them  worry about Vietnam, has  to have  some authority. We cannot  limit  it  under our Constitution  too much.  I  would have to oppose the amendment  and do.  I thank the Senator.  ",1984
452,407,6,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I am  voting against tabling this amendment  for basically the same reasons that I  voted on a similar amendment offered  by Senator KENNEDY  last Thursday,  March 29, 1984, as set forth  in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD at page 7023.  That vote, as well as my earlier vote  against a motion to table Senator KEN NEDY'S similar preceding amendment  No. 2856, expressed my support for ef forts to find a way to reaffirm the con stitutional authority of the Congress  of the United States to declare war, or  to ""make rules for  the Government  and regulation of the land and naval  forces"" through expressly authorizing  the use of U.S. personnel in situations  which may amount to war or may lead  to war.  These  specific proposals  and  this  exact language may not be the best  way to address this serious problem,  but I believe we should now debate  this issue and consider alternatives in stead of merely  tabling this amend ment.  We cannot afford  to wait until a  crisis forces our hand; we must find a  practical, workable solution now, while  we have time for full debate and rea soned analysis. These amendments are  a start and should be seriously and  carefully considered by the Senate at  this time.  ",1984
453,407,6,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, the  present amendment offered by  the  Senator from Vermont certainly raises  a serious issue, the necessity for con gressional involvement in decisions to  place combat troops in Central Amer ica. It is too broad and lacking preci sion to warrant passage and I support  the tabling motion.  I have consistently supported con gressional involvement in situations in  which U.S. combat troops become di rectly involved in hostilities in foreign  countries. During debate on this bill I  supported another amendment which  would  have  limited  placement  of  combat troops in EI Salvador and man dated congressional approval of par ticipation of  those  troops  in active  combat hostilities. As  I  interpreted  that amendment,  it would not have  forbidden use of U.S. advisers or sur veillance aircraft. The present amend ment is too broadly worded and would  be prone to an overly general applica tion of limits on the presence of non combative American military person nel.  ",1984
454,407,6,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I came  here just as the Vietnam war ended  and it was amazing how, at the end of  that year, it was hard to find a single  person in Congress who supported the  war. The vast majority  in both the  House and Senate, both parties, had  all been closet opponents of the Viet nam war. I did not find a Member of  the House or Senate who said they  had been in favor of the Vietnam war.  I always wondered who those mysteri ous people were who kept voting the  money for Vietnam. Here is a chance  for us to step up and be counted on  what could well become a mini-Viet nam just off our borders.  I yield  to the Senator from Dela ware.  ",1984
455,407,6,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, the dis tinguished Senator  from Oklahoma,  sitting in front of me, said hard cases  made bad law. That does not mean  you do not have to speak out against  them. Hard cases left unresolved begin  to stink; hard cases  left unresolved  begin to rot. You have to address the  hard cases. This is a hard case.  As Professor Corwin said, the Con stitution is little more than an invita tion for the Congress and the Presi dent to battle for the authority to con duct foreign policy.  The President does not have the au thority to make war, he has the au thority to conduct a war. A Command er in Chief does not initiate a war, he  conducts a war. We are talking about  initiation as opposed  to conducting,  because allegedly, we are not involved  in a war. That is what the President  tells us, that is what our friends tell  us, that is what everyone tells us.  Last, Mr. President, this is not a nu clear strike. The fact of the matter is  the analogy is not at all appropriate  for the following reasons.  We know that there is in fact a set  of circumstances which may result in  this administration,  if they have al ready,  soon  committing  American  troops. Now, would anyone suggest to  me that if it took 6 months for a mis sile to fly from Moscow to the United  States, the Congress should play no  part in determining what we should  do? Is that what you are saying to me?  We know what  is happening down  there,  fellows.  this a  surprise  to  you? We know.  Second, in this amendment, it says,  ""Mr. President, we understand that if  the United States is in jeopardy, you  have to act quickly."" We understand,  Mr. President,  if Americans are  in  jeopardy, you have to act quickly. But,  Mr. President,  if you want to make  this an American war, short of those  two  things, come and tell us,  let us  know. Let us be part of what is our  constitutional obligation, I say to my  friend from California, ""obligation.""  That is to be part of the determina tion whether or not we wish to go to  war, to initiate a war, not to conduct a  war.  ",1984
456,407,6,The PRESIDING OFFICER., All the  time of the Senator from Vermont has  Is  ,1984
457,433,6,Mr. STEVENS., I thank the Senator.  I yield to the Senator from Maine.  ,1984
458,433,6,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Maine.  ,1984
459,433,6,Mr. COHEN.,"  I  thank the Senator  for yielding.  Mr. President. I was not on the floor  last Thursday afternoon when Sena tors MOYNIHAN,  INOUYE, and DUREN discussing U.S.  policy  toward Nicaragua and the conditions  placed by the Senate Select Commit tee on Intelligence on covert aid to the  Contras. But as I heard their remarks  in my office. I found myself fully in  agreement with what they were saying  and concluded that I should join them  in speaking here on  this  important  issue.  The covert aid issue is a difficult, a  troubling, one. Those of us on the In telligence Committee have been wres tling with it for some time. We have  come from many points of view. from  many perspectives. but we have sought  common ground. The recent 14  to 0  vote  reflects  our  commitment  to  reaching consensus decisions. ones we  can support in a bipartisan manner.  Chairman  GOLDWATER  and  Vice  Chairman  MOYNIHAN  deserve  the  highest praise for the leadership they  have shown in the area. And I want to  give  particular  credit  to  Senator  INOUYE, whose guidance and inspira tion have provided the legislative vehi cle which we  are considering here  today.  I endorse this measure which we are  debating today-and I endorse the In telligence Committee's recommenda tion. But I feel I must emphasize to  my colleagues my growing  concern  that the administration is paying in sufficient heed to the strong reserva tions and restrictions laid out by the  Intelligence Committee.  Since I joined the Intelligence Com mittee a year ago, the covert aid issue  has been the preeminent one which  has confronted us. While our sessions  are closed I believe I must make clear  that many of us have. as we debated  this issue. expressed the gravest of res ervations over how the money would  be spent.  Both the Senate and House Intelli gence Committees have approved the  use of covert aid for purposes of inter dicting the flow of arms from Nicara gua to those seeking to overthrow the  governments of neighboring countries.  This is a valid purpose. for the Sandi ntstas  themselves have stated flatly  that they are intent on exporting revo lution throughout Central America. In  fact. one of the Sandinista leadership's  senior members. Department of  the  Interior chief Thomas Borge, has said  that President Reagan was correct in  suggesting that this was their inten tion.  Last May.  the House Permanent  Select  Committee  on  Intelligence  stated, ""<The insurgency in El Salvador> depends for  its lifeblood-arms.  ammunition. financing, logistics. com mand-and-control facilities-upon out side  assistance  from Nicaragua and  Cuba."" Last week it was reported that  half of the weapons used by Salvador an rebels were captured or acquired  from  that  country's  soldiers.  The  other half of the rebels' weapons. and  about 80 percent of their ammunition.  comes in from Nicaragua, according to  intelligence community estimates.  It is for this reason that the Intelli gence Committee has. on a bipartisan.  consensus basis.  supported  the con tinuation of covert assistance. But let  me emphasize again. that we approved  that aid only after establishing clear  limitations concerning  the purposes  for which it could be used. In fact. we  secured from the administration a new  Presidential  finding,  delivered  last  September 20, which  included more  precise and more  limited goals  than  the ones we had been briefed on earli er. That Presidential finding provided  the basis for the redefined program  which  received  committee  approval  last fall.  It has been and continues to be, my  belief  that  the  covert  assistance  should not be used for efforts to over throw the government or to attack the  economic infrastructure of the coun try. We should not condone acts aimed  at destroying powerplants. bridges and  the like.  Mr. President. I think I had a first hand glimpse of how this proscription  was being ignored. Last fall, my col league, Senator HART,  and  I visited  Nicaragua, El Salvador. and Honduras.  Our plane was an hour outside of Ma nagua when we received word that we  would have to divert to Honduras be cause the Managua airport was under  attack.  Later that day, when we finally ar rived in Nicaragua-the second plane  in after the bombing-we were shown  documents recoverd from the attack ing plane which could lead to no other  conclusion but that the individuals in volved had received some sort of out side assistance.  That attack was followed soon there after by explosions at oil refineries in  Nicaragua. And we have read regularly  of other attacks against economic tar gets. most recently the mining of har bors.  One can argue that the mining  is  also aimed at interrupting the flow of  supplies or ammunition going into El  Salvador. That case can probably be  made. But I want to say that I am  troubled by such actions. and I think  many of my colleagues who are speak ing here today are also  troubled by  them. They do not seem to be consist ent with the restrictions which have  consistently been outlined by both the  Senate and House Intelligence Com mittees as we have authorized covert  assistance to Nicaraguan Contras.  What has  troubled me  further  is  that our Government has not. in my  view.  followed  through on its stated  goals toward Nicaragua. We have said  that we want  the Nicaraguans  to  schedule elections. to reduce CUban in fluence in their country, to stop the  export of revolution  to  their neigh bors.  and  to ease  their  restrictions  against  the  press  and  opposition  groups within their country.  I  share  the skepticism about  the  good faith of the Sandinista regime,  but one cannot deny that they did.  last fall. take a number of initial steps  which were directed toward our con cerns.  Clearly, the steps taken were insuffi cient-they were not anywhere near  sufficient-but it is also clear that we  can exercise greater diplomatic efforts  to  bring  about  the  desired  goals.  Rather than rejecting the initiatives  made by the Sandinistas. we should  seek to expand them so that they con form to the promises they made as the  very  basis  of  the  revolution. We  should permit  them  to demonstrate  that they are willing to reduce Cuban  influence. We  should give  them  a  chance  to show  that  they will not  export their revolution to Costa Rica.  Honduras. El Salvador and the other  countries of Central America.  If. every time the Sandinistas take a  step, we tell them it is not enough and  simply continue the bombing, we can  never hope to have any positive influ ence on them. And if we continue to  provide open-ended assistance to those  seeking  to overthrow  them. we will  continue to sow the seeds of mistrust  within  their  government  and with  their people. Further. we will only  harden the views of the most strident  members  of  the  ruling  body  and  reduce our chances of winning  the  confidence of  those who  are more  moderate.  ",1984
460,433,6,Mr. STEVENS., Will  yield right there?  ,1984
461,433,6,Mr. COHEN., Yes; I yield to the Sen ator from Alaska.  ,1984
462,433,6,Mr. STEVENS.," I want to make sure  the Senate and  the Senator under stand that this is not an open-ended  appropriation. Of the $21 million, $7  million is available immediately. The  other $14 million  is  available only  under the reserve contingencies and  can be obligated only under the statu tory procedures. and the Senator and I  know what they are in terms of clear ances with the Intelligence Commit tees. So there is nothing open ended.  It is not even $21 million. It is $7 mil lion subject to the control of our com mittees.  I urge  the Senator  to understand  that we have followed, and I congratu late the Senator for his statement. we  have followed that procedure. We are  trying to have the control exerted by  the Senator  ",1984
463,446,6,Mr. DODD.," I do not include a defini tion in the amendment because obvi ously  reasonable people could have  some difficulty over that. What I have  read into the RECORD is the State De partment definition incorporated in a  report of theirs issued a few months  back where they define the terms ""ter rorism"" and ""international terrorism,""  and then cite some specific examples  of what they mean by them. I am will ing to accept their definitions. If some one else would prefer another one,  that is fine. But I would pref er not to  tie the amendment down by including  some  specific  definition  in  there.  Rather, I am willing to accept what  this administration decides  is  terror ism. Whatever definition they are will ing  to apply  to  it,  I am willing  to  accept. I  think since we have made  such a case of talking about terrorism,  including the Secretary of State last  evening before the Trilateral Commis sion, one of the first press conferences  by former Secretary of State Haig de fining terrorism as his great interest in  human rights, the President's talking  about terrorism a few days after his  inaugural address, I  think they have  placed a great deal of emphasis on this  international problem.  I  agree with  them. I am willing to accept their defi nition and use the word terrorism, and  let them apply that definition as it af fects  this  particular  country with  these particular funds.  ",1984
464,446,6,Mr. NUNN.," I share the sentiments  of the Senator from Connecticut on  this point. I think there is a very thin  line here. I think it is very important  that our Nation,  in our quest  for  trying to get other countries around  the world  to  join us  in our  fight  against terrorism, we ourselves, is able  to draw  that  line consistently. The  question I have at this late hour is  whether we have indeed drawn that  line, and whether we know what the  word means in this amendment.  Let me ask a hypothetical question.  Hypothetically, if any of this money  were  to be used by,  say,  guerrilla  forces to intercept arms from Nicara gua leading to El Salvador, by, let us  say, blowing up a warehouse, and let  us say the warehouse was guarded by  armed personnel of  the Nicaraguan  Government and there was good infor mation that warehouse was being used  to  supply  other Central American  countries, would  that be  terrorism  under this?  ",1984
465,446,6,Mr. DODD.," Not as far as this Sena tor is concerned. That is a military  target, the interdiction of arms.  ",1984
466,446,6,Mr. NUNN., The Senator is getting to  innocent civilians?  ,1984
467,446,6,Mr. DODD., Protecting innocent ci vilians is the thrust of it.  NUNN.  Hypothetical  action  against armed forces would not consti tute terrorism?  Mr.  ,1984
468,446,6,Mr. DODD., Not to this Senator.  ,1984
469,446,6,Mr. NUNN.," And the Senator would  not define terrorism as being, let us  say, an activity against,  let us say,  boats going from one country to an other supplying arms?  ",1984
470,446,6,Mr. DODD.," Not where the boats are  armed. If you had military equipment  on there, and you were focusing your  target on military personnel, unfortu nately they may be victimized but I  would not say that it was terrorism.  ",1984
471,446,6,Mr. NUNN.," And in the incidentals of  that military target if civilians were  killed but not by intention, would that  be terrorism?  ",1984
472,446,6,Mr. DODD.," If the major purpose of  that attack was a military  target, I  have no problem with that.  ",1984
473,446,6,Mr. NUNN.," But  if there was an  attack against the  innocent civilians  who had nothing to do with the smug gling of guns, were not part of the  armed forces, but the attack was made  against the innocent civilians  in the  form of intimidation, to intimidate the  remainder of  the population, would  that be terrorism?  ",1984
474,446,6,Mr. DODD., I believe it would be.  ,1984
475,446,6,Mr. NUNN., I thank the Senator.  ,1984
476,446,6,Mr. PELL., Would a fishing boat be  an example of a military target?  ,1984
477,446,6,Mr. DODD.," If it were not a fishing  boat, absolutely.  Mr. President, unless I have further  requests for time-I have heard no one  speak against the amendment. I can  only assume that this will enjoy uni versal support.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and  nays.  ",1984
478,446,6,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,  Is  there a sufficient second? There is a  sufficient second.  The yeas and nays were ordered.  ,1984
479,446,6,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, does  the Senator  from Connecticut wish  now to yield back his time? If he does,  we are willing to yield back ours.  ",1984
480,446,6,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I reserve  the remainder of my time. If we can  just have an up or down vote, is that  possible?  ",1984
481,446,6,Mr. STEVENS.," No, Mr. President;  not until the time has expired.  ",1984
482,446,6,Mr. DODD., Would my distinguished  colleague from Alaska agree with me  that we might have just an up or down  vote as we have on other amendments?  ,1984
483,446,6,Mr. STEVENS., No.  ,1984
484,446,6,Mr. DODD., May I ask my distin guished colleague  from Alaska why  this amendment should be treated dif ferently from the preceding ones?  ,1984
485,446,6,Mr. STEVENS., Because this amend ment is amendable if it is not tabled.  ,1984
486,446,6,Mr. DODD., We are voting on it up  or down.  ,1984
487,446,6,Mr. STEVENS.," If it is not tabled, it  is subject to clarification. I believe it  should be tabled. It is an ambiguous  amendment.  ",1984
488,446,6,Mr. DODD., Is there any objection to  agreeing to this on a voice vote?  ,1984
489,446,6,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, I take  it that the Senator from Connecticut  wishes to reserve his time and I shall  speak very briefly.  My friend and neighbor from Massa chusetts described a very horrible situ ation and asked whether that was ter rorism. Of course it is. The problem is  that we are, by a vote of this body,  funding an operation which is a covert  operation, which we really cannot talk  about in any great detail on this floor,  as my  friend  from Massachusetts  knows. The fact of the matter is that,  in any military confrontation of this  type or  any other,  there  are  acts  which  probably well  could  be  de scribed as terrorist acts and have been  since the beginning of war. Certainly,  anyone familiar with the history of  the Vietnam war would have to say  that things happened during that war  that were hardly 100 percent military  in nature and might well be described  as terrorist on both sides.  The President has set forth in his  letter what  the  intention of  these  funds is, what our policy is. The fact  of the matter is that the last hour has  proved one thing more than any other.  No one doubts the good intentions of  the Senator from Connecticut and the  Senator from Massachusetts. But the  colloquy  among  the Senators  from  Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Dela ware indicates very clearly the great  difficulty that everyone would have in  deciding what, in fact, the definition  ought to be in a particular situation.  I expect we could probably sit here  for weeks and list a whole group of  things  that,  under  certain  circum stances, we could all agree would be  terrorist. But in financing what we are  financing  under  this  appropriation,  certainly, it is no one's intention, even  those who oppose the amendment of  the Senator from Connecticut-and I  shall oppose it-to finance activities of  the nature and the type described by  the Senator from Massachusetts. But  the very fact of the matter is  that  with the kind of activity that is being  engaged in in Central America on both  sides,  there will be  instances,  there  have been instances, in which, I sup pose, terrorism could well be defined.  But there is no way to place a restric tion with the kind of definition that is  contained  in  this particular amend ment on this appropriation and essen tially allow any funding whatsoever.  The fact is that it cannot be satisfacto rily defined.  So,  for  those who wish  to vote  against this amendment, I expect that  they will vote against it not because  they encourage or support the kind of  activities aptly described by my friend  from Massachusetts  and my  friend  from Connecticut, but because  they  are uncertain and unsure of what this  really means. I certainly am.  ",1984
490,472,6,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, on  February 9, I  introduced S. 2309, the  Antiterrorism Rewards of 1984. Since  then, the distinguished Senators from  Maine  <Mr.  CoHEN), Vermont <Mr.  LEAHY), Hawaii <Mr. INOUYE), Colora do <Mr. HART),  and Delaware <Mr.  BIDEN), have joined as cosponsors.  The bill would create a $10 million  fund  from which  the Secretary of  State could pay rewards for inf orma tion or services concerning  terrorist  acts abroad directed against U.S. per sons and property. The fund would  also be available to the Attorney Gen eral to supplement his present author ity to pay rewards concerning terrorist  activities in this country.  This measure is offered principally  as a response to the alarming increase  in terrorist violence abroad directed  against our Nation, which accounted  for the deaths of 27 4 Americans last  year. In 1984, the United States con tinues to be a favored target of terror ists. In February, Leamon Hunt, the  Director General of the Sinai Peace keeping Force was murdered in Rome.  Last month, Robert Homme,  our  Consul General in Strasbourg, France,  was wounded. Yesterday, Army M.  Sgt. Robert Judd, Jr., of the U.S. Mili tary Acceptance Group was shot near  our air base outside of Athens. The attempt on Sergeant Judd brought to  mind the assassination in Athens of  U.S. Navy Capt. George Tsantes, of  the Joint Military Advisory Group, in  November 1983, as well as the killing  ",1984
491,498,6,Mr.  JONES  of  Oklahoma.," Mr.  Speaker, the difference in House Con current Resolution 280 and 282 is that  House Concurrent Resolution 280  is  the basic committee bill with the pay as-you-go committee amendment, that  we passed in committee, incorporated  into it. House Concurrent Resolution  282 is the basic committee bill without  the committee pay-as-you-go amend ment.  I think the gentleman is well aware  of that.  If the gentleman desires not to have  the pay-as-you-go amendment,  there  are at  least  two  substitutes which  would take that out and would freeze  spending.  So that is the explanation. It is not a  gimmick. As a matter of fact,  if the  House in Gramm-Latta l, 3 years ago,  had put ourselves  and our budget  process on a pay-as-you-go basis, per haps we would not be facing such un precedented Federal deficits.  Mr. LA'ITA. Let me say to the gen tleman that if he had voted for the  cuts that we made in Gramm-Latta 1  and 2 and the Latta-Michel budget in  1982, we probably would not be in the  position we are in today. Hopefully,  before this debate is over, the gentle man will join this side and make some  real cuts.  ",1984
492,498,6,Mr. JONES of Oklahoma.," I will say  to the gentleman, if he will yield, that  if the gentleman's alternative budget  in 1981 had passed, we would not be  facing these deficits. We would have a  balanced budget, in reality.  Mr. LA'ITA. Well, let us wait until  we get to the debate on the resolution  itseH.  Let me say that the gentleman just  concurred in what I said, they.did not  have this gimmick in House Concur rent Resolution 282  so  they had to  resort  to House Concurrent Resolu tion 280.  But let me say, as far as the Rules  Committee is concerned, I think it has  done a good job in reporting out a rule  that everybody can live with. There  were a  couple of amendments  that  were requested that were not made in  order,  including one  that was  dis cussed during the deliberations of the  Rules Committee yesterday, one that  was  raised on his side of the aisle,  about  the  so-called  pay-as-you-go  thing. I was quite surprised that the  majority did not grant a  rule  that  would permit the Democratic side to  strike that so-called pay-as-you-go as  they brought it up in the Rules Com mittee.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania <Mr.  WALKER).  ",1984
493,498,6,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, I would  hope that we would understand for a  moment what  this  rule does. What  this rule does is that it says the major ity side is entitled to bring six budgets  to the floor, the minority side is enti tled to bring two budgets to the floor.  That is a 3-to-1 margin in terms of  considering these important matters.  The Rules Committee has obviously  decided that the majority side is going  to be given as much time and as many  budgets as it needs to try to get some thing passed here which fits the ma jority's version of what should be done  rather than giving the minority equal  time.  ",1984
494,498,6,Mr.  JONES  of  Oklahoma.," Mr.  Speaker, will the gentleman yield?  ",1984
495,498,6,Mr. WALKER., I yield to the gentle man from Oklahoma.  0 1250  ,1984
496,498,6,Mr.  JONES  of  Oklahoma.," Mr.  Speaker, I just asked the gentleman to  yield for a clarification. The minority  will have the right to off er three. I  think the gentleman may be overlook ing the President's own budget, which  we  have made  in  order  that  any  Member of the minority can offer.  ",1984
497,498,6,Mr. WALKER.," I  thank the gentle man and  I  know  the gentleman  is  being most generous in that since the  President him.sell no longer ascribes to  that particular budget. We know that  the gentleman was trying to be mag nanimous, but somehow his magnani mous nature strikes this gentleman as  being something the minority Mem bers of the body would hope to follow  through on.  ",1984
498,498,6,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1984
499,498,6,Mr. WALKER., I yield to the gentle man from South Carolina.  ,1984
500,498,6,Mr. DERRICK., I would like to point  out to the gentleman that no other  Member of  the minority asked  the  Rules Committee to make any other  substitute in order. You have to get up  there and ask us; are we supposed to  read your mind?  ,1984
501,498,6,Mr. WALKER.,"  If the gentleman  would allow me to reclaim my time, I  know that there were some Members  of the minority such as Mrs. RoUKEMA  of New Jersey, Mr. FRENZEL of Minne sota, who did ask for amendments to  be made in order, and that those were  specifically turned down by the Rules  Committee.  So I think that we do have a situa tion where minority viewpoints and  minority  amendments were  turned  down by the Rules Committee, and it  still comes back to the point when we  come to the floor, it is a 6-to-2 margin.  It is a 3-to-1 margin in terms of major ity offerings and minority offerings.  One of the most important parts of  this rule that causes us some difficulty  is the fact that the last bite of the  apple is going to go to the majority so  that we can go  through  the whole  process here. We can get many issues  resolved only to have the majority to  be able to come back and give us a  budget that will give  them the last  bite at the apple, regardless of every thing else we have done.  That seems to me to be unfair too, in  terms of the kinds of issues we may  want  to  resolve on  this  floor. The  point  is  this: That  the party  that  wants the country to believe that it  stands for fairness shows us again that  its deeds  speak  louder  than words.  This rule gives the minority a  little,  but it gives the majority a  lot. This  rule is typical of the way we operate  around here all the time: Using the  power of the majority to give special  advantages  to  the majority when it  comes to consideration of legislation.  We are going to be discussing very  important matters here; yet this rule  says that the most important issue is  giving the majority the power to crush  minority opinion. Now, that may not  make much  difference  anyhow be cause the entire budget process is so  terribly flawed.  History shows us that whatever we  do here is probably going to be irrele vant, and let me just cite some figures:  The gentleman from Oklahoma said a  few moments  ago  that  it was  the  budget that was passed in 1981 that  created the deficits. I would suggest  that the whole budget process for the  last 5 years is what has created the  deficits, because if you look back you  will find out in fiscal year 1980 we had  a First Budget Resolution that pro posed outlays of $532 billion. We spent  $47.6 billion more than that.  In 1981, we spent $43.6 billion more  than we said we were going to do. In  fiscal year 1982 we spent $33 billion  more than we said we were going to. In  fiscal year 1983 we spent $26 billion  more than we said we were going to,  and in fiscal year 1984, we have spent  $3.5 billion more than we say we are  going to.  That  totals  $153.9  billion;  that  comes awfully close to being where the  budget is. In other words, the congres sional overspending, beyond what we  said we were going to do in our budget,  is what has caused deficit problems  out there, and it seems to me that the  American people ought to realize that  while we may have a  lot of fire and  smoke out here, it is probably going to  be very irrelevant anyhow.  This rule gives the minority a little  bit, as I said before, it gives the major ity an awful lot. This rule is unfair,  and demonstrates again the abuse of  power that characterizes majority rule  in this body.  e ",1984
502,498,6,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker,  this  rule does not provide for openness and  fair deliberations. Extensive debate is  allowed, and we will have no less than  eight budget options from which  to  choose. The ""last passed wins"" rule is  not perfect. but it far surpasses last  ",1984
503,511,6,Mr. KEMP.," I thank the gentleman  for his comments, and he brings up  something that I talked about a little  bit earlier, which is the importance of  monetary policy in reaching an equi librium in the budget battle.  I know this shocks some of my more  orthodox friends, but I do not see how  the deficit could have caused interest  to go up in 1979 and 1980 and 1981. In terest rates were higher where the def icit was lower, and vice versa. But if  you look back at the history of the  Federal funds  rate,  targeted by  the  Fed, look at the discount rate which is  set by the Fed, in 1979, it went from  single digit to double digits when the  deficit was the smallest in the last 10  years.  The Federal funds rate was kept at  about 15 percent on average  for 3  years. What happened is that it killed  the housing industry, the auto indus try, the steel industry, it caused the  collapse in farm prices, it caused the  collapse  in  our  agricultural  trade  policy, and unemployment went from  about 6 to 11 percent. According to the  CBO, five points of unemployment is  at least $150 billion of deficit.  The gentleman from Illinois is right:  Get unemployment down, and you will  get the deficit down. Yes, we need to  cut spending; yes we should be con cerned about those out of work; yes we  should be concerned about  training,  and  I will  join any person on  this  floor, left, right, or center, in coming  up with the right kind of job training.  I have mentioned his name a couple  of times. I think it is only fair before I  yield to my colleagues on the right,  that I yield to Mr. SIMON from Illinois  for a question.  ",1984
504,511,6,Mr. SIMON.," I  for yielding.  On some things we are in agreement;  on some things we are not in agree ment. Let me just point out factually,  you criticized the Democratic proposal  on the budget because of revenue in creases. It is $49.8 billion, while the  Latta proposal was $47.2. Not much  difference between the two.  ",1984
505,511,6,Mr. KEMP.," Let me take back my  time long enough to say that there  will be another budget alternative pro posed by my  friend,  the gentleman  from California  <Mr.  DANNEMEYER)  that has no tax increase and envisions  tax reform a  la Bradley, Gephardt,  Kemp, Kasten, Weber, Walker, Ging rich, Dannemeyer, Mack, et al. We  thank my colleague  think that we should talk about lower ing the rates instead of just taking out  loopholes. You could take out lots of  loopholes, but you ought to lower the  rates at the same time or else it is a  tax increase. You ought to lower the  rates; make  the  tax  system more  simple. Make it fairer. Give the people  who  are  filling out  their 1040's a  chance to do it by themselves without  having to hire a lawyer or an account ant or H&R Block.  I have nothing  against H&R Block, but it is the fast est  growing  franchise  in America  today.  ",1984

507,511,6,Mr. KEMP., I again yield to the gen tleman from Illinois.  ,1984
508,511,6,Mr. SIMON., The one area where we  are in agreement is that we ought to  encourage as many private sector jobs  as we can. But then I think we have to  recognize  that  unemployment  is  a  fairly permanent phenomenon.  ,1984
509,511,6,Mr. KEMP.," There I disagree. There  I disagree. This  is not a permanent  phenomenon. Nothing  is permanent  unless we make it so.  This economy is going through one  of the-I know that this will probably  be derided by my friend from Illinois but it is going through a shedding of  its industrial skin as newer technology  becomes applied to autos and steel and  manufacturing and machine tools. Our  best is ahead of us and we can encour age  this  renaissance by working on  further  reforms  that will make  the  future even brighter if we have the  courage and perspicacity  to act cor rectly.  0 1420  Mr. ZscHAu of California, and other  members in the high-tech caucus, can  blow our minds in telling us about the  future of this economy if we encour age new enterprises which create jobs.  But  those Malthusians who believe  that it is all over for America, that we  cannot compete, and that we have to  husband our shrinking resources and  punish our people and go back  to  living with less, I  think they are on  the wrong side of the issue, they are  on the wrong side of history, they are  on the wrong side of the American  people.

512,511,6,Mr. DOWNEY.,  They are all waiting.  I yield to the gentleman from Flori da <Mr. MACK).  ,1984
513,511,6,Mr. MACK.," I  for yielding.  thank the gentleman  Mr. Chairman, There are a couple of  points. One the gentleman from Illi nois brought up, where in essence he  said it is too bad that we do not really  talk about these questions that con cern unemployment more often and  for longer periods of time. Here we are  with what usually is a 4-hour debate  on Humphrey-Hawkins that has been  cut down to an hour and a half.  ",1984
514,511,6,Mr. KEMP., And what a shame.  ,1984
515,511,6,Mr. MACK., I think it is a shame.  ,1984
516,511,6,Mr. KEMP.," I will tell the gentleman,  if he could see what I see from stand ing here, all of the Republican Mem bers standing, waiting, chomping at  the bit to get a chance to talk about  full employment, and there are only a  couple Members of the other party,  which used to talk about it, but which  mostly is not even here today. I am so  proud  that  there are  some of our  people who literally want to move this  country forward into a new economy  and a brighter future.  ",1984
517,511,6,Mr. MACK.," If the gentleman will  yield further, the debate really is what  happens with economic growth in the  country. The question really is: What  do we do about employing people?  The other day during one of  the  budget hearings,  I  asked  the chair man, I said,  What is the end result? What are we going  to say to the American people that we have  accomplished because of what we do in our  budget work? Are we going  to put more  Americans back to work? Are we going to  reduce  interest  rates? Are we  going  to  reduce inflation? Are we going to raise to a  higher level our economic growth? Are we  going to sustain that for a longer period of  time?  Do you know what happened? There  was almost total silence. When I asked  Paul Volcker the question about what  level of economic growth could he sup port for a long period of time, his re sponse  basically  was  somewhere  around the numbers that either OMB  or the CBO suggested, which are 3.3  percent to 4 percent.  So I asked him the question: What  do we have to do in order to raise the  level of real economic growth? What  do we have to do in order to go to 41/:a  or 5 or 51/:a percent that would satisfy  you so that you would not come in and  drop the money supply?  He responded and said two things:  One thing you have to impact is pro ductivity. The other  thing  that he  talked about doing was that we have  to increase the capacity of the country  to produce goods and services.  Do my colleagues realize how much  time we have spent in the year and a  half I have been here talking about  how we improve productivity? Exactly  zero. No time at all. And yet when we  had 4 hours set aside so we could talk  about it today, what did we end up  with? We ended up with an hour and a  half, of which we get 45 minutes to  talk about  the  two most significant  ",1984
518,524,6,Mr. JONES of Oklahoma.," Before I  yield to the next speaker, I do want to  tell my good  friend,  the gentleman  from Minnesota, who  is  a  valued  member of  the Budget Committee,  that  I  think  the Budget Act has,  indeed, reduced the deficits.  As a matter of fact, John Rhodes,  the  former  distinguished minority  leader of  the House of Representa tives, has said that the deficits would  probably be $400 billion higher had it  not been for the disciplines, imperfect  as they are, of the Budget Act since  1976.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 8 minutes to  another distinguished member of the  Budget Committee,  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts <Mr. DONNELLY).  ",1984
519,524,6,Mr. LATTA.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 5  minutes to the gentleman from Penn sylvania <Mr. WALKER).  D 1610  ",1984
520,524,6,Mr. DONNELLY.," I thank the chair man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  to be very  frank,  when this year began I was very skep tical, as a member of the Budget Com mittee, that this institution would be  willing and able to achieve any sort of  deficit reduction due to the political  and economic circumstances that we  faced as Congress convened. We had  $200 deficits annualized out as far as  you could see, probably a very heated  and bitter Presidential election on the  horizon, congressional elections  that  are now taking place in primaries and  taking place in November, a  very serious clash of economic and  monetary policy differences between  the parties and, in fact, between indi viduals on both sides of the aisle.  I  think  this  institution  and  the  Budget Committee as a whole deserve  a great deal of credit for focusing the  attention of the membership on the  critical problem that this Nation and  the economic recovery in this ?fation  faces because of these enormous defi cits that have been accruing over the  last few years and will continue  to  accrue unless we have  the political  courage to do something about it.  So step one is that we are moving in  the right direction. The debate today  is what it ought to be about, and that  is what are  the priorities  that we  will be  ",1984
521,550,6,Mr. LOEFFLER.," I thank my distin guished minority  leader for yielding  me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I have got to ask the  question: Why should anyone support  the pending amendment? Quite frank ly, the form that this amendment has  been submitted to us on the floor is  not one that is serious. If those of you  on the majority side were serious in  putting together this amendment, you  would  have  included  reconciliation  procedures to enforce the savings as sumed in the budget resolution.  The gentleman who  just preceded  me in the well from the State of Mon tana enjoyed exploiting the issue but  would never place the budget in ques tion in any real jeopardy of being im plemented. So, it remains for this gen tleman to ask the question: What is  the matter, were you afraid that if  this had been considered in a serious  manner, with full enforcement proce dures, that it might have passed?  Compare what  the President has  done with respect to the deficit reduc tion activities this year, with this friv olous exercise by the majority party.  The President has been serious. On  January 25, he came  to  this  floor.  During his State of the Union address  to the Nation, he said, and I quote:  We must bring down the deficit to insure  continued economic growth. In the budget  that I will submit on February l, I will rec ommend measures that will reduce the defi cit over the next 5 years. Many of these will  be unfinished  business  from  last year's  budget. Some could be enacted quickly if we  could Join in a serious effort to address this  problem.  I  spoke  today with Speaker O'NEILL,  Senate Majority Leat!~r BAKER, Senate Mi nority Leader BYRI>, and House Minority  lAade~ M1CHEL. I asked them if they would  ~signate congressional  representatives  to  meet with representatives of the administra tion to try to reach prompt agreement on a  bipartisan deficit downpayment plan.  I know it will take a long, hard struggle to  agree on a full-scale plan. So, what I have  proposed is that we first see if we can agree  on a downpayment.  Now, I believe there is basis for such an  agreement. One that could reduce the defi cits by $100 billion over the next 3 years. If  the congressional leadership is willing, my  representatives will be prepared  to meet  with theirs at the earliest possible time. I  would hope the leadership might agree on  an expeditious timetable in which to devel op and enact that down payment.  Now, what has happened since Janu ary 25? Representatives of the admin istration and Representatives from my  party were serious in their efforts to  negotiate. The majority party here in  this Chamber was not serious, and  therefore, we did not make a $100 bil lion deficit down payment in a biparti san manner.  So,  the  President  came  forward  again, and he announced that if the  majority party  in  the House  is not  willing to negotiate in a serious way,  then he would work with the Senate  leadership and with  the Republican  minority in the House and come up  with a $150 billion deficit reduction.  D 1820  That is being serious. Again, to the  majority: When you off er an amend ment, be serious in your intentions or  be straight forward about the charade  you are engaged in.  ",1984
522,550,6,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 3  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Oregon <Mr. AuCoIN).  Mr. AuCOIN. I thank the gentleman  for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, we have been hearing  a  lot of crowing about Presidential  leadership over  the  last 3 years.  I  would remind my colleagues that one  of the powers of a Presidential leader  is his power to present a budget laying  out the direction he proposes for this  country.  The Constitution gives that power to  the President. It does not give it to the  President and Mr. LATTA; it gives it to  the President of the United States.  The President's budget, any Presi dent's budget, is the major fiscal docu ment of any session of Congress. It is  the point of reference. This budget  happens to be $192 billion out of bal ance.  I am astonished that some Republi cans are now asking why it is that we,  in the House, should vote on the Presi dent's budget. Well, I  remember the  ringing words of the President when  he addressed the joint session of the  Congress and ushered in his revolution  which gives us these staggering budget  deficits.  I would answer the Republican mi nority leader's question when he says,  why should we vote on the President's  budget, by repeating the words of the  President at that time. The President  said: ""If not we, who? If not now,  when?""  ",1984

In  the  substi tute, under the rule, you could have  offered a balanced budget here today  or tomorrow.

536,550,6,Mr. LOTT.," I  thank the gentleman  for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I would first like to  ask a question. I would like to ask the  gentleman from Oregon where it is in  the Constitution that says the Presi dent of the United States submits a  budget to the Congress?  I will answer the question. It is not  in the Constitution. It is in the Budget  Act of 1921. It is not in the Constitu tion, though.  As far as who  is playing fast and  loose around here, I submit that the  Congress ls the guilty party. The Con gress has for years rejected Presidents'  budgets, as my colleagues on the other  side of  the aisle  rejected President  Carter's budgets, and year after year  spent more than he requested.  In fiscal year 1980, for instance, he  requested $531.6 billion. The Congress  went over  that by $47.6 billion.  fiscal year 1981, he requested $651 bil lion and Congress went over it by $45  billion.  ",1984

538,563,6,Mr. JONES of Oklahoma.," If the gen tleman will yield, all of the substitutes  and the committee's budget adopt a  whole range of Grace Commission re forms, some legislative, some adminis trative. Studying  this  substitute,  I  would like to ask this question: Of the  $153 billion in Grace Commission sav ings, could the gentleman tell me how  much of those have to be legislated  and how much will be required to be  saved by the administration in their  administrative responsibilities?  ",1984
539,563,6,Mr. WALKER.," It is my understand ing in this budget that a great number  of them are regarded as being legisla tive, but it does exclude a number of  the major Grace Commission reforms.  For instance, it excludes military re tirement reform,  it excludes a  long term civil service retirement reform, it  excludes the sale of all the power mar keting administration reforms,  it ex cludes the reforms suggested by the  Grace Commission on Federal subsi dies.  In other words,  there  are  a  number of  things which are not  in  there.  ",1984
540,563,6,Mr. JONES of Oklahoma., I wanted  to know what it included.  ,1984
541,563,6,Mr. WALKER.," As  the gentleman  knows, I have 2 minutes here. There is  an  entire  paper  here  that  goes  through these, and a large portion of  them are in fact the reforms that are  anticipated legislatively.  ",1984
542,563,6,Mr.  JONES of Oklahoma.,"..  II we  could have a copy of that, I w:ould ap preciate it.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  <Mr.  WALKER) has expired.  ",1984
543,563,6,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield the gentleman from Pennsylva nia 2 additional minutes.  ",1984
544,563,6,Mr. JONES of Oklahoma., Could we  have a copy of that?  ,1984
545,563,6,Mr. WALKER.," I would say to the  gentleman from Oklahoma that we do  have copies of the presentation over  here.  I would also say that the gentleman  makes a point when he suggests that a  large  portion  of  that  entitlement  money that is  in there comes out of  the farm income. I come from a heavy  farming district. Most of the farmers  in my district would like to see us go  back to the free market in farms, and  I would think that they might want to  consider in an election year that one  of the things we ought to be doing is  changing our programs so that inter est rates could come down for them, so  that Federal spending comes down.  Also, I would say that the gentleman  from California made the point that if  his budget were adopted, with just a! percent  increase  in GNP, we would  have his budget balanced by 1989.  Well, I think that is something we  ought to consider, that what the gen tleman has brought to us is a balanced  budget, because there is no doubt in  my mind that with a 2-percent cut in  interest  that would certainly  result  from the gentleman's proposal and a  2-percent cut  in  the unemployment  rate that would surely result from the  gentleman's proposal, we would get  that !-percent  increase  in GNP. So  what we are really considering here is  the only balanced budget that will be  brought to the floor as well.  So I would suggest to the Members  that if they want to vote and say that  the reality is that this House cannot  institute  the Grace Commission  re forms, then you vote against the Dan nemeyer budget. But I would suggest  that is a bad vote. If you want to vote  against the only true balanced budget  attempt that will be brought to the  floor, vote that way, but I would sug gest that that is not a vote that would  be  appreciated  by  the  American  people. I would suggest a yes vote on  the Dannemeyer budget.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1984
546,563,6,Mr. DANNEMEYER.,"  I  thank my  colleague for his comments.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from California <Mr.  McCANDLESS).  Mr. McCANDLESS. I thank my col league, the gentleman from California,  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of the substitute offered by my  colleague from California, ",1984
547,563,6,Mr. DANNE MEYER.,"  The  Dannemeyer  substitute  is  unique among  the eight substitutes  that will be offered as it is not prem ised on the faulty assumption that the  deficit is so high because taxes are too  low. All of the other budget proposals  rely on another large tax increase to  reduce the deficit.  The question must be asked: Do tax  increases reduce the deficit ? A review  of recent history clearly indicates the  answer to that question is ""no."" Since  Federal  revenues-taxes-have  increased nearly 3 in times. During the  same period of time, the deficit grew  1970,  1982,  astronomically.  In  Congress  passed the largest tax increase in his tory, TEFRA, which was billed as a  deficit reduction measure, and yet the  deficit continued to grow.  It is apparent that tax increases will  not solve the deficit crisis, yet they are  the cornerstone of the other propos als. I suggest to my colleagues that the  ""crisis""  is on  the other side of the  ledger-expenditures  are  too  high.  The Dannemeyer budget  recognizes  this fact and reduces  the deficit by  placing  long  overdue  restraints  on  Federal spending.  A budget resolution  is a blueprint  for the operation of the Federal Gov ernment for 1 year. Consequently, it is  improbable that any resolution will be  completely satisfactory. Such  is  the  case with this substitute. While we all  may have reservations about individ ual items contained within or omitted  from this budget, it meets the goal of  reducing  the deficit  by  controlling  Federal spending and not by resorting  to yet another fleecing of the Ameri can taxpayer.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to  support the Dannemeyer substitute.  D 1930  ",1984
548,563,6,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield 2 minutes  to  the gentleman  from California (Mr. LUNGREN).  ",1984
549,563,6,Mr. LUNGREN.," I thank the gentle man for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, there has been a lot  of discussion here about how we ought  to best take care of the deficit as we  see before us. One of the points at tempted to be stressed by the gentle man  from California  <Mr.  DANNE MEYER) and others is that we have over  the last number of years, every year,  increased our tax revenue. We have  had a number of tax increases, many  of them involuntary by bracket creep,  and yet we  have  the deficits grow  larger and larger.  Just 1 year ago, or a year and a half  ago, we passed a major tax increase,  and within weeks, the deficit did not  go down, the deficit went up-at least  all projections with respect to the defi cit. One of the things that people fail  to  realize  is  impact on  the private  sector will be essentially  the  same  whether you take funds away from it  by virtue of taxes or whether you take  it by virtue of borrowing those funds  away from it.  The effect  is virtually  the same;  there  is  less money,  there  is  less  oxygen given to the private sector. So,  the gentleman from California <Mr.  DANNEMEYER) has presented  to us a  budget here  that does not base  its  whole activity on the premise that the  primary way to reduce the deficit is to  increase tax rates. Rather, it looks at  spending cuts.  Everybody seems to be for spending  cuts; we have a number of proposals in  ",1984

551,576,6,Mr. CAMPBELL.," The point the gen tleman made I want to ask him again.  If it is a CPI minus 2 percent, it ap plies across the board?  ",1984
552,576,6,Mr. JONES of Oklahoma., That is  correct.  ,1984

Social  security and  all  the others,  reduce it to a CPI minus 2 percent,  and it would take indexing of taxation  and reduce that to a CPI minus 2 per cent.  We will  accomplish  that all next  this  substitute passes  this  week  week.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to  the  gentleman  from Massachusetts  if  (Mr. DONNELLY).  ",1984
557,576,6,Mr. DONNELLY.," I thank the gentle man for yielding to me.  Mr. Chairman, let me just reiterate  what I think is the fundamental flaw  in the Roemer-Stenholm-Montgomery  approach, at least in regards to entitle ments. That flaw  is simply  this: Al though on face value it seems as if it is  fair, that we are reducing all entitle ments 2 percent across the board, the  system presently  is  innately unfair.  Not all annuitants, whether they be  social security, military retirees, civil ian  retirees,  railroad pensioners,  re ceive the same annual cash annuity.  When  you  reduce  all  across  the  board, when  the bottom  line comes  when  they  receive  that check on a  monthly basis, not everybody is going  to pay the same penalty, the 2 percent  across  the board would make  them  pay.  If  D 2100  That  is  the  fundamental  flaw.  there was a  threshold,  if there was  protection for those lowest annuitants,  those minimally under $10,000, I think  there is some validity in the argument.  I think there is some validity in much  of this argument. I just do not think  this is the way to approach the prob lem.  ",1984

560,576,6,Mr. ROEMER.," I  man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is cor rect in saying that if we had a thresh old or lifeline concept across all enti tlements, we could be more fair. But I  know the gentleman will not change  social security into a welfare program.  I know the gentleman has not changed  or attempted to change a single law to  take  non-means-tested  entitlements  and make them based on income.  If the gentleman  is willing  to do  that, we will have a threshold lifeline,  and I will join him then in a diff eren tiated COLA cut. But until then, this  is the best that can be done.  ",1984

I  effort on both sides of the aisle on  people of all different philosophical  and political beliefs to get to the root  of what is going to be a major problem  in terms of fiscal policy, and that is  getting a handle on the entitlement  programs.

565,576,6,Mr. ROEMER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank our colleagues who have joined  with us tonight for the quality and  quantity of their debate tonight on an  important issue.  I agree with those who said that this  budget is not perfect, because it is not.  But I disagree with  those who said  that we lack either the wisdom or the  courage to do the inevitable beginning  now.  The interesting thing about entitle ment discipline is that a little action  early pays large dividends down the  road. The size of the deficits facing  your mother  and  father  and your  family are terrifying. Do you not love  to hear economists, whether they be  supply-siders or old Keynesians, talk  about the fact that ""We can survive  these deficits."" How do  they know?  America has never had these kinds of  deficits before. It is like listening to  generals when they talk about atomic  warfare. How do  they know? They  were never in one.  The same  thing on  these deficits,  and I know this: $200 billion a year for  as far as you can see will eat every  social program alive, will turn every  highway program into a desert, will  affect every domestic spending pro gram you hold dear.  Vote for a budget that is real. Vote  for a budget that is fair, one that does  raise taxes, and I do not like it, one  that does cut military, but unlike some  would say, it does not gut it, it just  cuts it. Vote for one that takes domes tic spending, nondefense, and for 3  years has a soft freeze. It allows the  entitlements  to go up. It allows all  ",1984
566,602,6,Mr. FAUNTROY.," Mr. Speaker, on  Monday, April 2,  1984,  the George town University Hoyas defeated  the  University of Houston Cougars for the  National Collegiate Athletic Associa tion basketball championship by the  score of 84 to 75.  I  am particularly pleased because  Georgetown University  is  located  in  the District of Columbia and a number  of the players on the basketball team  are products of the District of Colum bia public schools.  Mr. Speaker, in celebrating this vic tory I would like to make three points.  First, under the leadership of Coach  John Thompson the Georgetown bas ketball program has improved tremen dously  in  the  last 12  years. Coach  Thompson  continuously  produces  teams which emphasize  togetherness  in all aspects of the game.  Second, Coach Thompson is actually  an educator/coach.  the  last  few  years we have been subjected to sto ries about black athletes who have  been used by coaches without atten tion to their educational needs. Coach  Thompson's program at Georgetown  places special emphasis on obtaining a  college  degree.  In his  12  years of  coaching, Mr. Thompson has recruited  45 players of whom 43 have graduated.  Third, Coach Thompson's program  also emphasizes protection of the ath letes  from  undue  and  unnecessary  over-attention by the media. He has  been criticized heavily by the media  for ""Hoya Paranoia."" Yet, many failed  to understand that Coach Thompson  recognizes that these college athletes  are students first and not objects to be  exploited and sensationalized for com merical purposes.  I congratulate Coach Thompson, the  players,  the Georgetown University  community, alumni, and  friends  for  this tremendous victory   In  IRA GALLAWAY AND EL  SALVADOR  HON. ROBERT H.

567,602,6,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, Rev. Ira  Gallaway, pastor of the First United  Methodist Church in Peoria, Ill., was a  member of the U.S. delegation which  observed the recent elections in El Sal vador. Dr. Gallaway, who has previ ously visited  that country, was very  impressed by the people of El Salvador  and their desire for democratic government and peace. I  think all our col leagues would benefit by reading an  account of his observations, as pub lished in the Peoria Journal Star.  At this time, I wish to insert in the  RECORD, ""Elections Stand for Modera tion"" by Elaine Hopkins,  from  the  Peoria Journal Star, March 29, 1984.  ELECTIONS STAND FOR MODERATION  <By Elaine Hopkins)  Sunday's election  in El Salvador repre sented ""a definite 'no' to the extremism of  the  right  and  left,""  says  the Rev.  Ira  Gallaway, pastor of the First United Meth odist Church of Peoria.  Dr. Gallaway was part of a U.S. State De partment delegation observing the election.  The 31-member group arrived in El Salvador  Saturday and  left Monday after visiting  seven municipalities Sunday to observe the  voting.  ""We  talked  to people directly. We had  many  conversations"" with  all  sorts  of  people, Gallaway said.  Everywhere people told him, ""We're here  to vote for freedom, we're here to vote for  democracy, we want peace,"" Gallaway said.  Delegation members were able  to  leave  the group and talk to people independently  and privately, he said. ""We talked to old  people, young people, middle-aged people.  You can tell whether they're being forced to  do something,"" the minister said.  Though citizens are required to vote in El  Salvador, ""people said no punitive measures  were taken against those who didn't vote,""  he said.  People seemed to be committed to demo cratic  processes,  Gallaway  said.  ""One  woman told me she walked <14 miles> and  stood  three hours  in  line""  to vote. ""It's  worth  it.  It's for  freedom  and  peace,""  Gallaway said the woman told him.  He said he received the impression ""the  leftists do not control  the mind of  the  people."" He visited with labor leaders and  others, and everywhere people said they op posed military dictatorship  and did not  want to go back to an oligarchy or a govern ment run by wealthy intesests. But they are  also opposed to Marxist rule involving state  control, he said.  Gallaway said he saw ""bureaucratic bun gling"" and problems with a U.S.-supplied  computer which was  supposed  to aid  in  voting. But  the  committee  unanimously  agreed the election was a ""step towards pos sible democratic rule  in El Salvador,"" he  said.  ""There's no insurance that peace is going  to come to that country. This is a step in  their possible democratic future.""  Gallaway said he saw no indication of vote  fraud. Every ballot box was watched by rep resentatives of all eight political parties,  and they were ""watching each other with  apparent good humor,"" he said.  Leftists  boycotted  the  election,  saying  ""they would have exposed themselves""  to  reprisals, he said.  ""I hope people of this country are aware  of how precious freedom is,"" he said. People  here take such processes as voting for grant ed, and many do not bother to leave their  comfortable homes to vote, he said. But in  El Salvador, ""I see people struggling to gain  freedom,"" he said. There is ""a great commit ment on the part of many people to voting.""  Gallaway has been on a speaking tour in  Michigan, but plans  to  arrive  in Peoria  today.e  ",1984
568,615,6,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week I was unavoidably absent for the  House vote on H.R. 3755, the Disabil ity Benefit Reform Act of 1984. Had I  been present I would have joined the  majority of my colleagues who voted  overwhelmingly to pass the bill.  The need for immediate reform in  the disability review program cannot  be overstated. This  administration's  attempts to reduce the disability rolls  have  imposed  terrible hardships on  thousands  of worthy  beneficiaries.  Hundreds of thousands of people have  been denied benefits to which they are  entitled. These are people who are se verely disabled, who cannot work, who  depend upon  the social security dis ability system for their very existence,  and who previously worked and earned  their right to be protected from eco nomic disaster in the event of severe  disability.  When Congress passed the disability  amendments in 1980, the intent was to  carefully review the medical eligibility  of  those persons  receiving disability  benefits and to ferret out fraud. The  result, however, has been nothing less  than a wholesale purge of the disabil ity rolls. The benefits of deserving re cipients are being terminated because  of flawed procedures, poor data and  arbitrary  decisionmaking.  There  is  simply no excuse for this.  Steps must be  taken to put more  consistency, equity, and administrative  control  into  the  review process.  properly structured a review program  can be implemented successfully with out jeopardizing the rights of the dis abled who legitimately depend on dis ability for their life support. H.R. 3755  offers this kind of framework. It pro vides important safeguards for individ uals who are subject  to  review and  issues specific guidelines to eliminate  the choas which continues to plague  the program. It deserves the undivided  attention of the Senate.e  If  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.EDWARDJ.MARKEY  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 4, 1984  ",1984
569,615,6,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, I was  unable to be in attendance to vote on  three amendments to the budget reso lution that was under consideration.  Had  I  been present,  I would have  voted against the amendment offered  7891  by my  friend  from  Colorado,  an  amendment that embodied the Presi dent's budget proposal and served no  use  to  the budget process;  I would  have voted against the amendment of fered by my colleague from California,  which  I  believe was  a  hypocritical  effort to cut the budget since it low ered domestic spending by $136 billion,  but gave $100 billion more to the Pen tagon; and, I would have voted against  the amendment offered by my col league  from  Louisiana,  since  the  amendment called for substantial re ductions in domestic spending while it  increased the defense budget by $64  billion.  Mr. Speaker, I am in strong opposi tion to any budget proposal that does  not reorder our priorities away from  dramatic increases in defense spending  to a sensible approach that gives the  Pentagon no more than they need and  restores cuts to domestic spending.e  H.R. 4813  HON. WAYNE DOWDY  OF MISSISSIPPI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 4, 1984  e ",1984
570,615,6,Mr. DOWDY  of Mississippi.," Mr.  Speaker, I have received a copy of a  letter from 31 members of the House  Agriculture Committee to House Com merce  Subcommittee  Chairman  FLORIO outlining their interest in H.R.  4813,  the pending Superfund  reau thorization legislation. I request that  this letter be reprinted following my  statement because I share the Agricul ture Committee members' concerns  about proposals contained in the Su perfund legislation that will eliminate  the tax exclusion for chemicals used in  the production of farmer used f ertiliz ers. I am alarmed that this particular  provision of H.R. 4813 will unnecessar ily  increase  agricultural  production  costs by approximately $142 million  per year-a cost that my Mississippi  farmers  and other  farmers  in our  country cannot afford.  I believe that it is very important  that  the House  of Representatives  proceed expeditiously with the reau thorization of Superfund, and I fully  support this effort. However, I would  like to point out that the 1980 debate  on Superfund clearly identified the va lidity of a  tax exclusion for farmer  used fertilizers. The record in 1980 was  clear that a fertilizer exemption was  justified, and I believe that the record  today is clear that the exemption is  still justified.  I want to thank the members of the  House Agriculture Committee-in par ticular my  colleagues Congressman  Bedell and Congressman Madigan-for  bringing this problem to our attention.  I agree with their concerns and plan to  work with them to hold down farmer  ",1984

572,641,6,Mr. FAUNTROY., No;  I am sitting  right here.  ,1984
573,641,6,Mr. KEMP.," We should not divide  this country into rich and poor and  middle income, or $20,000 and above,  or $20,000 and below, and say  that  above $50,000 is bad and under $50,000  is good, or poor people are going to be  poor forever. Let us try to make the  poor rich or at least richer.  Your budget, with all due respect,  suggests  that  once  you  are  poor,  always poor.  I  reject  that.  I  reject  that. Even GARY HART recognizes that  we need a bigger pie, and we do not get  a bigger pie by redistributing income.  If we want to help the poor, we should  be moving toward a flatter, fairer, sim pler, lower tax rate system for all. And  we will be  introducing one such as  that designed by BRADLEY and GEP HARDT.  1982  in 1982  You raised the earned income  tax  credit by 6 percent. I would raise it  high enough, so that the working poor  would be removed from the tax rolls. I  do not think the working poor should  even have to pay income tax. The way  to finance that would be to get the tax  rates down to where people would ac tually pay more tax at the lower rate,  and that is what has been happening,  despite everyone shaking their heads.  That has happened. The official pre liminary tax figures from the IRS for  show  that  those who  earned  $50,000 and above paid $7 .3  billion  more  than the year before,  while those earning under $50,000 paid  less in 1982.

574,641,6,Mr. LA TT A.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 1  additional minute  to  the gentleman  from New York.  ",1984
575,641,6,Mr. KEMP.," I appreciate the gentle man yielding me this additional time.  Mr. Chairman, this is an emotional  issue because we are all wrapped up in  what we  think will help  the most  people. But I  think we should reject  the idea of dividing this country into  classes. We can only help the coun try's poor by making  the economy  grow, and this CBC budget is not a  growth  budget  it  is  an  austerity  budget and I submit, austerity is not  the answer,  it is  the problem. I am  going to vote against it not because I  disagree with the goal of my friends in  CBC, but I am going to vote against it  because I disagree with the means to  the end. I do not think raising taxes in  a recession or in a recovery will create  jobs.  I congratulate you all for bringing  this to the floor, but I think we really  ought  to give some  thought  to  tax  reform,  simplicity,  lower  rates,  and  getting interest rates down by more  pressure  on  the  Federal  Reserve  Board, to stop trying to slow down this  recovery as they seem bent on doing  by raising the Federal funds rate. I  think the gentleman would agree with  me that we should look forward to a  continuing dialog about how to really  help poor people in America, because  with all due respect to our friends in  the Congressional Black Caucus, this  budget is not only going to make the  poor poorer,  this budget is going to  make the whole country poor.  ",1984
576,641,6,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  such time as he may consume to the  gentleman  from  New  York  <Mr.  WEISS).  distin ",1984
577,641,6,Mr. WEISS.,"  I  thank my  guished friend for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I simply want to com mend the Congressional Black Caucus  for presenting what I think is the fair est and best conceived budget of all  those that have been proposed.  It is easy to talk, but if we really  want to cut the deficits back,  if we  want  to cut the waste and extrava gance out of military expenditures, if  we want to restore the opportunities  for  jobs and to restore some of the  cuts in basic programs which are abso lutely essential for America, I urge all  of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle  to vote  for  the Black Caucus  budget amendment.  Four  years  ago, Ronald Reagan  promised to ""chart a different course""  for this Nation. Today, there are few  who would challenge his success in ful filling that ominous vow.  The President set out to cut domes tic spending, and he has succeeded. By  cutting $192 billion from domestic pro grams through 1985, he has ignored  the needs of disadvantaged and work ing Americans,  thrusting  8 million  more of them into poverty.  He has set out to increase military  spending, and he has succeeded. De fense spending has been increased by  $79 billion through 1985, funding more  and more armaments  that edge us  closer and closer  to an unthinkable  confrontation.  He set out to cut taxes, and he has  succeeded. The largest tax cuts in his tory, expected to exceed $1 trillion by  1989, have succeeded  in making the  wealthy  wealthier  while  ordinary  Americans struggle to get by.  And,  in achieving  these successes,  the President has accumulated more  debt than many of us dreamed possi ble. It is a debt which has raised inter est payments more than the amount  of  ""savings""  from  reduced  social  spending. And it is a debt which seri ously  endangers  the  future of our  economy and the ability of our Gov ernment  to meet  the needs of  its  people.  The chief flaw of most of the budget  proposals which we are considering is  that they fail to recognize that Ronald  Reagan has achieved his objectives.  Many of them seek to freeze spending  31-059 0-87-21 (Pt. 6)  II,  II,  $35  at current levels, which would simply  maintain Ronald Reagan's costly and  inhumane policies. And many of them  seek to cut the rate of increase in de fense spending or cut the rate of de crease  in domestic  spending, which  would simply slow the rise in Ronald  Reagan's national misery index.  However, there is one budget before  us today which recognizes that Ronald  Reagan's policies must be turned back,  not  reinforced.  The  Congressional  Black  Caucus  has  introduced  an  amendment that will drastically reor der our priorities, raising the value of  fairness above greed and heartlessness  on our national agenda. The Black  Caucus deserves the highest commen dation for this proposal, which repre sents the only real alternative to the  continued threat posed by the policies  of Ronald Reagan.  The Congressional Black Caucus  budget would target employment, edu cation, health care, urban  renewal,  mass transit, and other domestic needs  as our chief priorities.  In all,  the  budget provides $63.9 billion more for  domestic  programs  and  billion  more  for  essential entitlement pro grams over 3 years.  The caucus budget would reject the  wasteful excess  in military expendi tures by eliminating funding for desta bilized weapons systems, such as the  MX, Trident  Pershing  and  cruise. In all, defense reductions would  total $202. 7 billion over 3 years.  And the caucus budget would take a  giant  leap  in  the direction of  tax  equity by instituting overdue reforms  that will raise $181 billion in new reve nues over the next 3 years.  These important steps will result in  deficit  reductions of $324 billion by  1987, far greater than those under any  other plan.  Mr. Chairman, we have before us a  budget that does not only stem the  tide, but turns the tide back. It is a  budget  that serves  the needs of all  Americans.  I call upon all Members  who  seek  a  secure  and prosperous  future for our Nation to  join me in  support of  the Congressional Black  Caucus budget.  ",1984

There is not a candidate  for President in these United States,  with the exception of Jesse Jackson,  who is not calling for real increases in  defense spending.  I  compliment  the  gentleman on his activity in the pro curement area, and I think he is very  well aware what I have been doing in  the spare parts reform area, and there  is no one who has been tougher on  that than I. But what I am saying is  that there is no question the systems  are going  to continue, although we  may continue to have a debate. What I  am concerned about  is  the ultimate  level of GNP growth  in solving  the  problem and having a  realistic pro gram to do it.  ",1984

586,654,6,Ms.  FIEDLER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  would just like to make one point. We  often talk about cutting defense, and  we think in terms of cutting out some  of  the  terrible  tools of war. But  I  think it is also important that when  we take a look at the reduction in de fense, we are also talking about reduc ing significant numbers of jobs that  are currently being held. For every bil lion dollars in defense spending, there  is  somewhere  between  30,000  and  50,000 jobs being created. While that  is not a good argument to invest de fense money,  it  is a  fact of  life  in  terms of the investment.  ",1984

588,654,6,Mr. DELLUMS.," I thank the gentle man for yielding 1 minute to me.  Mr. Chairman, I would simply say to  the gentlewoman from California that  if you look at the Congressional Black  Caucus budget alternative, in the de fense function it is precisely for the  reason  that the gentlewomen raised  the question of the loss of jobs that we  place $6  billion  in a  new  category  where we say that if the Congress of  the United States makes a decision  that is in the national interest, for ex ample,  to cut the B-1,  that a  local  community should not have to absorb  the economic impact of that decision  by the loss Jobs. So with that $6 billion  we then generate a program that puts  those, say, 1,800 workers to work not  building the B-1 bomber but moving  to a reconversion approach where we  talk about building peaceful approach es to life.  The gentlewomen raises an excellent  question. But what we are saying in  this budget is that we have an answer  to  that,  to free our colleagu~s from  the more pedestrian, mundane politi cal consideration of whether people  lose jobs in their districts, and are able  to make  the policy decision  as  to  whether we need a weapon system.  And if that has an adverse impact on  the  local  community, we  generate  funds so that people do not lose jobs.  The gentlewomen's point is well taken,  but we try to deal with it.  ",1984
589,654,6,Mr. DIXON.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Wis consin (Mr. OBEY).  ",1984
590,654,6,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, there are  a number of amendments today which  are legitimate efforts to unite liberals  and conservatives alike to attack the  deficit problem  in a  realistic way.  I  think the MacKay amendment is one,  for instance, because it defines budget  baselines above which we should not  be spending without new taxes to fi nance that spending. But that has a  problem in that it leaves no real nego tiating room with the Senate for prior ity adjustment. The McHugh amend ment most accurately reflects my view  of what this House ought to be able to  minimally achieve by way of attacks  on the deficit.  But I frankly believe that the Dixon  amendment is best in terms of depart ing  from  the  timidity which  has  plagued this town and which has pre vented us from  really attacking the  budget deficit  in a  really dramatic  way.  I do not agree with some of the mili tary assumptions made in this budget.  I certainly do not agree with some of  the domestic numbers, and I specifical ly do not agree with the estate tax  suggestions or the agricultural area,  for  instance,  and  I  have questions  about some of the social spending that  is suggested. But the amendment  is  preferable  to other alternatives  for  one basic  reason: This  is  the only  amendment before us  that makes a  sufficiently dramatic attack on  the  deficit to really make an economic dif ference.  I would also point out, for those of  you who have concerns about specifics  within this resolution, that the jour ney is not determined by where you  start;  the  journey  is determined by  where you wind up. And this is the  only alternative before us which gives  us an opportunity, through the confer ence process with the Senate, to wind  up where we ought to be, with much  larger deficit reductions than we will  have under any other alternative, and  also  gives  us  the  opportunity  to  thank  produce a mix of military and domes tic programs that has some degree of  social equity. It also, I believe, is the  only one of the alternatives that suffi ciently  recognizes  that concurrently  with budget deficit reductions we also  have  to make  some  specific  invest ments in areas that are essential for  the future growth of  the economy,  those  three being education, health  and manpower.  I have  just come from a meeting  with Nobel Laureates who have laid  out the dramatic shortcomings in the  budget  on  basic  health  research.  There is only one budget alternative  before us which allows us  to meet  those needs within the context of a  greatly reduced budget deficit. This is  the alternative, and I would urge the  Members' support for it on that basis.  ",1984

592,654,6,Mr. JONES of Oklahoma.," I  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, again I want to bring  to the attention of the House the con tents of this substitute. I  think it is  important that what we vote for in a  budget  resolution  today, we be pre pared to vote for when appropriations  and other bills come along to enforce  the budget.  Before I do that, I do want to com mend the gentleman from California  <Mr. DIXON)  and other members of  the Congressional Black Caucus  for  presenting to us the only true alterna tive to the approach that most of the  other substitutes and the committee  package adopts  in  terms of budget  policy. I think there is a clear-cut dif ference between this alternative and  the other budgets  being  presented  today.  But I think we should be clear as to  those differences. As has been pointed  out, this substitute calls for a $183 bil lion tax increase over the next 3 years,  and that is more than double any of  the other substitutes which are before  the House today. It includes elimina tion of a number of tax expenditures,  such as the depletion and expensing  allowances on natural resource extrac tion, plus alternative minimum tax on  corporations,  limitation on mortgage  interest  deductions  for  multiple  homes, and many other things.  On entitlements, instead of cutting  entitlements it increases entitlements  by $35 billion over the next 3 years.  On defense there is no increase in  defense expenditure of any sort. In stead,  there  is 14.9 percent negative  real growth in defense expenditures.  On nondef ense, discretionary domes tic programs, there is an increase over  the House Budget Committee baseline  of $64 billion.  These are  the elements  that  the  Members would be voting on in this  ",1984

594,667,6,Mr. LA TT A.," Mr. Chairman, I reserve  the balance of my time.  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. PEASE).  ",1984
595,667,6,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the McHugh substitute. I  have just come from hearings in the  Trade Subcommittee where we heard  the chief executive officers of  four  major American corporations talking  about the problem of trade deficits.  Our merchandise trade deficit was $69  billion  last year. The estimates are  that it will go up to $125 billion this  year. These corporate officers told us  that  that will  have  a  devastating  effect on our economy. The one con crete step which they told us we could  It  take to reverse this trend is to reduce  Federal deficits.  I believe that with the McHuGH sub stitute we have a realistic opportunity  to do  that. The McHugh substitute  balances the sacrifice between defense  spending and domestic  spending.  does not ask for a disproportionate  share from either side.  In addition  to  that,  the McHugh  substitute provides for $76 billion in  revenue over the next 3 years, which,  as the gentleman from New York <Mr.  MCHUGH) has pointed out, surely  is  not an excessive amount when you  consider that the 1981 tax bill alone  will result in a loss of revenue of some  $490 billion over the same period of  time.  We all know that we are going to  have  to  take  a  three-pronged  ap proach;  cutting  back  on  domestic  spending, restricting the growth of de fense spending and increasing revenue  if we are to get the deficits under con trol.  The chief  executive officers with  whom we talked this morning empha sized that we do not have much time;  we must get the deficit down as soon  as possible.

600,667,6,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the McHugh substitute.  Mr. Chairman, I would just like to  say I  think this is the most creative  initiative we have before us. I want to  first of all give credit where credit is  due,  to  the Budget Committee  in  terms of the work they have done in  terms of domestic spending, because  this proposal tracks that proposal for  a 3-year change in domestic spending.  Many of the proposals have been legis lative initiatives that have passed and  realistically we a1e taking them into  consideration with this particular sub stitute.  But additionally, this substitute ad dresses  the other issues more eff ec tively in terms of dealing with other  problems on fiscal policy; namely, the  issue of defense spending and the issue  of taxes.  The tax dollars that are gained in  this particular measure is dedicated to  the reduction of the deficit.  Mr. Chairman, I think for too long  we  have  been measuring  defense  spending with  a  13-inch  ruler and  measuring domestic spending with an  11-inch ruler. I think it is high time we  began to face up to this. Because if we  do not face the crunch right now in  this year with regard to defense spend ing, it is simply going to be compound ed in the future years.  So I think it is time to address run away military spending and place real istic  limits  on  the  tremendous  in creases of the past 4 years. This meas ure keeps military spending exactly  where it is today with the adjustments  provided for only inflation.  Frankly,  I  think that that is ade quate. All  too often  the bargaining  chips have become weapons  in  the  field,  and some day  like almost all  military weapons the real possibility  exists for their use.  Today as we  focus on the budget  issue this measure provides the great est reduction of any of the remaining  budget measures to be considered it  means that we began today not after  the November  elections,  but  today  facing up to the reality of taxes and  spending.  I urge my colleagues sup port.  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut <Mr. McKINNEY).  Mr. McKINNEY. Mr. Chairman, it  seems to me that even though politics  as usual is part of the structure of this  House, and it seems to be where we  are coming from, once again, particu larly with the antics yesterday on the  original Reagan budget. The politics  as usual is not what is going on in the  Fourth Congressional District of the  State of Connecticut.  My people are tired of budget defi cits,  they are  tired of an overrated  American dollar because of these defi cits and high interest rates, which is  robbing Americans of jobs, trade, and  opportunity;  they  are  tired of not  being able to buy a house; and they  are tired of paying too much for a car.  In essense,  they are tired of Con gress not facing up to its responsibil ities.  I consider myself a good Republican,  though some might argue that point.  And I stand full square behind the  McHugh  substitute and  full  square  behind,  if  that does not pass,  the  MacKay substitue; as the only two re alistic documents that have appeared  in front of this body since the begin ning of this debate.  First off. some of you are going to  use the excuse that we have decimated  the Defense Department. Gentlemen  and ladies, please, the Pentagon has  had  a  41-percent  increase  in  real  spending power over the last 3 years.  I  ",1984
601,680,6,Mr. MACKAY.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  intend to cover two points in the open ing of this debate. The first is a tech nical point which will be covered in  detail by the gentleman from Oklaho ma (Mr. JONES),  the chairman of the  Budget Committee. It has to do with  the  impact  of  the MacKay-Nelson  freeze substitute on the social security  disability program. There is a techni cal error in the bill in the way it is  drafted. We are advised that this can  be handled and should not be cause  for alarm. It can be handled at the  conference  committee  level  if  this  should pass. It should not be consid ered as a substantive matter in the de cision on this vote.  The second point is an outline of the  policy issues covered by the MacKay Nelson substitute. This is a freeze sub stitute, an across-the-board freeze. It  is the simplest of all the alternatives  available  to  the House during  this  debate.  It  simply  freezes  spending  across the board at 3.5 percent above  the 1984 levels, with defense, social se curity, and some of the safety-net pro grams being increased to the level of  As  inflation; $47 billion in new tax reve nues from H.R. 4170 are applied total ly to the deficit reduction. The total 3year deficit reduction is $234 billion.  0 1410  This is not a final solution. Nobody  expects a final solution.  This is a start. It is a start in the  right direction. It is a signal to the pri vate sector, to our financial markets,  to our friends and allies that the Con gress and the President are willing to  begin a serious effort over the next  year or two to develop a stable and  balanced monetary policy.  proponents  of  the  spending  freeze we are not arguing that our de fense needs are not important. Clearly  they are.  We are equally concerned about our  programs for the needy. But unless we  make sense out of the Federal budget  these other crises are not going  to  make much difference.  The MacKay-Nelson substitute ap plies the same techniques as we would  in our families and in our businesses,  freezing expenditures across the board  and applying all available revenues to  reducing our debts.  I reserve the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman  from Florida <Mr. MACKAY) has con sumed 2 minutes.  ",1984

The vote you cast on  the  budget, if it should prevail, should be  the same kind of vote you are willing  to cast next week, next month, when  we implement the budget.  I do want to commend the gentle man from Florida <Mr. MAcKAY) and  all of the others, the gentleman from  Oregon <Mr. AuCoIN), the gentleman  from Florida <Mr. NELSON), the gentle man from Kansas <Mr. SLATTERY), and  the others who have worked so hard  on the substitute.  Essentially this freeze substitute is  the Budget Committee bill without  the  pay-as-you-go  amendment. But  that is a significant difference that I  hope the Members will focus on.

606,706,6,Mr. WYLIE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of  the Latta substitute.  I want to compliment my friend the  gentleman from Ohio. He is my next  door neighbor and I know of the hard  work,  care,  persistence,  and under standing that he has put into his sub stitute proposal.  On Monday  I  spoke  to  the U.S.  League of Savings Associations. On  Tuesday I spoke to the Ohio Bankers  Association and 2 weeks ago I spoke to  the American Council of Life Insur ance Agents.  These groups are made up of people  who make  a  living  adjusting  to  changes  in  interest  rates  in  the  months and years ahead. They are the  market place. Each group told me the  single most serious problem facing our  Nation is the size of the budget deficit.  I happen to believe they are right and  said so.  On a  recent questionnaire,  I  sent  out, most of those responding said the  budget deficit is our most serious na tional problem. So to represent my dis trict, I must try to do something about  it.  The savings and loan industry is particularly  sensitive  to  interest  rate  changes.  I was  told  in no uncertain  terms  that if Congress does not do  something about the deficit,  interest  rates will surely rise, maybe not this  year, but certainly early next year,  and a lot of savings and loans will go  out of business.  In each group  the  first question  asked was: Did I think Congress would  pass a budget which would substan tially reduce the deficit?  In answer to the question, I said I  was very apprehensive that we would  not, and that is why I have introduced  House  Joint Resolution  382  as  a  backup  to provide  for a Bipartisan  Budget  Reduction  Commission  to  come up with a package we can vote  on-up or down-like the Commission  which came up with a package to solve  the social security funding problem: A  plan to take the problem out of the  partisan political arena.  The reason I am doubtful that we  can pass a budget, and I hope I am  wrong, is because budgets are bloom ing like flowers in spring. I said there  is much partisan bickering about just  who is to blame.  The President  is being blamed by  some. But the fact  is  that Congress  has simply never had the courage to  cut spending, even though it became a  full partner in the budget process in  1974.  In this substitute which Congress man LATTA offers, President Reagan  has made some large concessions and  agreed to hold down defense spending  by a considerable amount. The Presi dent first thought the increase in de fense should be about 13 percent.  I  thought that was too much and said  so. The Latta substitute represents a  7.1 percent increase over 3 years; 7.1  percent may be  too much.  I would  have preferred 5 percent. But it is a  fact that in the wake of Vietnam, Con gress reduced defense spending drasti cally so that many of our major weap ons were becoming seriously outdated.  The  B-52,  our major  long-range  bomber, was older than many of the  pilots who were flying  it. Our Navy  was allowed to dwindle to 400 ships,  down from over 900 previously, and  many of our aircraft were out of serv ice due to the lack of spare parts and  trained personnel to maintain them.  Unlike  the 1950's when nearly 40  percent of our national budget was de voted to defense, we are now spending  far more on domestic health, welfare,  and social programs than is allocated  to defense.  So-called entitlements make up 48  percent of this budget. Defense 27 per cent. So controllables only represent  25 percent of the budget.  The significant  thing here  is  the  President has agreed to support a re duction of $40 billion in defense from  his first budget to get a compromise.  The President's plan would cut $49  billion  from domestic spending  this  year, and  tax  revenues would  raise  $47 .2 billion over 3 years including in terest savings that adds up to $204.5  billion in total deficit reduction over 3  years. The President has made an other concession on agreeing  to  in crease tax revenues.  The  deficit will  not  be  reduced  unless something is done to slow the  growth of Federal  spending or  in crease revenues or both.  My constituents feel we can close a  few loopholes and increase the tax on  alcohol and tobacco, to help keep in terest rates down, and that is what  this package would do.  The President has been willing  to  compromise on  this  important  issue  and I hope we will see some compro mise on the other side. If Congress  does not meet the President halfway  on reducing deficits, we could see run away interest rates and growing unem ployment again.  We cannot let that happen.  Congress must act responsibly and  lend  its hand  to  reduce  the deficit.  This is a good compromise. I urge its  adoption.  ",1984

608,706,6,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the chairman of the committee  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, some comments were  made with regard to enforcement pro visions.  I want to make clear to the  Members that the enforcement proce dures, whether you are looking at the  Latta substitute or the committee bill,  roughly  correspond  to  each  other.  There are really two enforcement pro visions that we have in terms of en forcing the provisions of any budget  resolution that is adopted. One is rec onciliation and the second deals with  the 302 allocations  that flow  to the  Appropriations Committee. Those are  really the two key tools that are used  by  the Budget Committee  in  the  budget process and,  indeed, by  the  House in terms of enforcing the tar gets that are contained in the budget  resolution.  Now, with  regard  to  the Budget  Committee proposal, we feel confident  that both of those tools can be used  and used effectively. As a matter of  fact, with regard to reconciliation, it is  our full intention next week to take up  a reconciliation bill that has $12.3 bil lion in savings. That is not all from  last year. About $9  to $10 billion of  that will be new savings recommended  by  the  eight  committees  that  are  under instructions with regard to rec onciliation; so next week there will be  a spending savings bill of approximately $12.3 billion that will be before the  House.  In addition to that, we have a reve nue bill that will raise approximately  $49 billion. Those  two  together will  ",1984

611,719,6,Mr. BOLAND.," Mr. Speaker, I  take  this opportunity to  join with Chair man WHITTEN, Mr.  CONTE, and others in their comments  about Pete Murphy, the staff director  of  the Defense Appropriations Sub committee, who  died  of  cancer on  Tuesday morning.  Pete Murphy combined all the quali ties that made an outstanding member  of  the  Appropriations  Committee  staff. He was  hard working-often  here on evenings and weekends. He  was  an  expert budget  technician dedicated  to  uncovering  the  issues,  that lay behind hundreds of millions,  yea, billions of dollars of budget re quests.  And Pete knew his subject matter as  well as any one in this town. From re search and development, through the  maze of DOD procurement-Pete had  a fine grasp of every program-wheth er it was the smallest handgun or the  B-lB bomber. He was also responsible  for  the Appropriation Committee's  review of the intelligence community,  and worked closely with the staff and  members of the House Select Commit tee on Intelligence.  His recommendations to the commit tee and to the Congress were marked  with a  thoroughness of review and a  careful understanding of what was the  right thing to do. And, Mr. Speaker,  above  all, Pete's  integrity  and  his  sense of honesty will be remembered.  No one who knew him, or who worked  with him-eould not come away with a  a  ""straight  feeling  that Pete was  shooter.""  Pete served in the Marine Corps in  the Pacific during World War II. He  saw action on both Guadalcanal and  the invasion of Bougainville. He also  participated in the Guam invasion and  the  invasion of Iwo Jima-where he  was wounded in an assault on an Iwo  Jima airfield.  Mr. Speaker,  in  John Kennedy's  first state of the Union delivered from  the podium behind me, he said:  Let  the public service be a proud and  lively career. And let every man and woman  who works in any area of our national gov ernment, in any branch, at any level, be able  to say with pride and with honor in future  years: ""I served  the U.S. Government  that hour of our nation's need.""  in  Pete Murphy was  that kind of a  public servant-and his 22 years as a  special agent with the Federal Bureau  of Investigation-and his 16 years as a  staff member of the House Appropria tions Committee are a  testament to  President Kennedy's words.  Finally, although Pete devoted the  best years of his life to his work-it  was his family that he loved and cared  for above all. He died at home with his  family as he wanted to, and our deep est sympathy goes out to his wife Eve  and their six children, Daniel P., Mi chael J., James P., Mary Ellen, Kath leen M., and Patricia.  We will all miss him very much.  THAILAND RECOGNIZED FOR  REFUGEE EFFORTS  <Mr. McCOLLUM  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, next  week our Nation will have the pleas ure of welcoming  the distinguished  Prem Tinsulanonda, Prime Minister of  Thailand.  On this occasion, I would like to take  a moment to recognize the Nation of  Thailand's truly outstanding accom plishments in the area of refugee re settlement-a subject  I  am well ac quainted with as a member of the Im migration Subcommittee.  For many years now, Thailand has  been a haven for thousands and thou sands of refugees from Vietnam, Kam puchea, and Laos who have fled Com munist terror and oppression. For any  nation,  such an  influx would pose  enormous logistical and organizational  problems and would require a major  commitment  on  the  part  of  that  nation to undertake the challenge of  overcoming them. Thailand has done  exactly that. Faced with responsibility  for the lives of thousands of homeless  and desperate men, women, and chil dren, Thailand has helped them begin  new lives with competence, efficiency,  and understanding. It has worked tire lessly  to house,  feed,  and care  for  these refugees and find new homes in  other countries.  Unfortunately,  Thailand's  excep tional efforts do not make the front  pages of the newspapers very often; in  fact, we rarely hear about the work  being done every day of the year to  bring order and stability back to the  lives of refugees with no place to go.  We do hear about the tragedies which  all  to often occur when people are  forced to flee as quickly as they can in  any manner that they are able to find.  But, we do not hear about the families  that are  fortunate  enough  to  find  their way into a well-coordinated re settlement process such as Thailand's,  and are quietly assisted in beginning a  new life. There are thousands of these  success stories taking place every year.  The nation of Thailand should be  commended for the truly excellent hu manitarian  resettlement program  it  has developed and for its proven abili ty to handle what is indeed an awe some  responsibility. Many  nations  have assisted the refugees of Vietnam,  Kampouchea and Laos, but none more  valiantly or with greater compassion.  Faced with the challenge of meeting  the needs of  thousands of  refugees  without homes-and without hope Thailand has risen to the occasion in a  manner which should be an example  to all nations. I urge my colleagues to  join me in recognizing the nation of  Thailand and its outstanding contribu tion to humanity.

612,719,6,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to call your attention to an edito rial in today's New York Times. The  editorial chastises the three television  networks for projecting the winner in  Tuesday's New York Presidential pri mary long before all polls had closed.  Election projections before polls are  closed do not inform voters, they dis courage them. The empirical evidence  clearly shows  that voters are much  less likely to exercise their franchise  when they are told who has already  won the election. Early projections do  not contribute in any positive way to  our democratic form of government they exploit it.  Mr. Speaker, I am very frustrated by  the network's competitive drive to be  first to project a winner. This blatant  irresponsibility is an egregious inter ference in our Nation's electoral proc ess.  I urge my colleagues to read today's  New York Times' editorial.  ",1984

616,732,6,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, first I  wish  to commend our distinguished  visiting chaplain  today. We are de lighted  to have him with us  in our  presence. He is another in a long line  of distinguished ministers who have  served as our visiting chaplain, and he  adds to the distinction of that group.  I also wish to thank Senator HAT FIELD for inviting him to perform this  function today.  May I say parenthetically that his  loud resonant voice must surely have  been heard by all in this room, and no  doubt  commands  the  attention  of  those who are not in the Chamber at  this moment.  SENATE SCHEDULE  ",1984
617,732,6,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, after  the two leaders are recognized under  the standing order,  there will be a  period for the transaction of routine  morning business until 10:30 a.m., at  which  time  the Senate will  resume  consideration of the supplemental ap propriations bill which  is  the unfin ished business.  I anticipate that the Levin amend ment will be offered shortly after we  convene. I understand that a reduced  time has been agreed to by the manag ers and Senator LEvIN to provide for  40 minutes equally divided. I am not  sure that has been formalized, but it  was my understanding  last evening  that it had been agreed to.  After that, Mr. President, I antici pate that my colleague from Tennes see,  Senator  SASSER, will  off er  an  amendment dealing with Honduras. It  is hoped that the 4 hours allotted for  that amendment can be substantially  reduced.  I  conversed with Senator  SASSER last evening about that, and I  am encouraged to think that we may  be able to negotiate a shorter time lim itation. That has not been done yet.  There are other amendments, Mr.  President, that may be offered. But in  any event, it is the hope of the leader ship on this side that we can finish the  supplemental  appropriations  bill  today. The Senate is on notice of, and  should be prepared for, a late session  today, if necessary, in order to accom plish that purpose.  In addition, Mr. President, as I have  advised the minority leader previously,  it is the hope of the leadership on this  side that we could then proceed to the  small  reconciliation bill,  so-called.  I  will discuss that further with the mi nority  leader  in  the course of  the  morning, but I would reiterate  that  hope.  Mr. President, as I see it now,  the  Senate will be in session tomorrow and  perhaps on Saturday, as  I  indicated  earlier this week. But if we can finish  the supplemental, and if we can finish  the small reconciliation bill, there is a  possibility at least that we could avoid  the Saturday  session,  and  perhaps  even a part of the Friday session. But  once more, I will discuss that with the  managers and most especially with the  minority leader.  SPECIAL ORDER REQUESTS  ",1984
618,732,6,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, I believe  the only other announcement that I  should make at this time is this: There  are a number of Senators who had re quested special orders for this morn ing. Since we did not recess until late  last night, I asked those Senators-I  believe  there are eight of them-to  postpone  their  requests  for  special  orders.  We will  try to accommodate  those  requests later today or, if not today,  then tomorrow. I offer my apologies to  those Senators for not providing spe cial order  time  this morning. But I  think they surely do understand that  after  a  late  evening, with  the  o'clock convening hour this morning,  and the necessity to try to finish the  supplemental appropriations bill that  it would have delayed beginning con sideration of that bill very substantial ly.  So I express my appreciation for the  willingness  to  forego  special orders  this morning.  I  assure  the Senators  10  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by the Member on the floor.  ",1984

620,745,6,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, plain ly and simply, when we voted  the  money last year, $24 million that has  been used and will be used through  May, we made a  covert program a  matter of public knowledge. Many of  the  us thought that it ought to be overt at  the time and I have no problem about  it being overt except for the problem  of  the  lives of  the people  involved.  That is a difficult thing, to hold hear ings and ask of the Contras to come up  here and testify and say, ""Now, where  are you going to go in February and  where are you going to go  in March  and where are you going to go in April  and where are you going to shoot your  last ammunition just before the 1st of  May?""  I think that when we really looked  at it, calmer heads prevailed and said  it  is a covert operation because the  lives of people involved are at stake.  We did it primarily because we had  knowledge of what went on.  We should be aware of what  Sandinistas are supporting.  I am trying to find that Wall Street  Journal editorial on what happened in  just 1 day as a result of Communist  supported guerrilla activity. I remem ber in 1 day bullets were sprayed on a  schoolbus; a grenade was put in the  hand of a person who was standing in  a mass of children.  In terms of the Honduras intrusion,  we flew down into the area where that  intrusion took place. It is a quiet delta  country that until the last few years  has not even had a road. People live in  abject poverty. Most people that are in  their sixties had never seen a doctor in  their lives. They were subject to an  attack all of a  sudden, out of  the  night, by this armed might that I have  been  talking about  from Nicaragua,  not once but on many occasions. They  suddenly  found  themselves  over whelmed without any defense at all.  They had not even known military  power in the past.  Now that has ceased. Those women  and  children  in Honduras  are  no  longer being killed. Their farms are no  longer being burned. The amount of  arms going into El Salvador has been  reduced and  that country now has  held not one but two elections and will  soon hold a  third one in which I do  not know of anyone who was reported  being killed standing in line for up to 6  and 7 hours waiting to vote, notwith standing  the commitment  that was  made by guerrillas to destroy the vote.  You ask what  the Contra process  has brought about. They have, in fact,  brought about the diversion that we  described  last  night,  that military  force is backing away from the borders  and it is now guarding in a defensive  way those installations that have im portance to the country of Nicaragua  from a military point of view.  And as I said, there are gestures of a  conciliatory nature saying we would  like to be back in the Contadora proc ess.  Again, those people that are in the  field are fighting for something that  they believe  in-a different kind of  government for Nicaragua.  I do not  endorse that. I have never said we are  going to provide them funds in order  to bring about and achieve an over throw of the Government of Nicara gua. We have said that we believe that  what they are doing is consistent with  our goals to bring about a realization  in Nicaragua that the military aggres siveness  that  they practiced  in  the  past will not be successful.  Mr. President, the main thing about  this amendment is  that this amend ment would in fact accomplish what  all of the amendments we have defeat ed so far would accomplish. Without  question,  it would mean  that  the  people that are in the field now who  have stated to interviewers that that  was their goal, to overthrow that gov ernment that is there in their country  now, but, yes,  they are doing what  they are doing and they know what  they are doing is bringing pressure on  their government, so they are achiev ing our objective and dreaming that  they might achieve theirs. That would  be a force that would no longer be able  to receive any ammunition. Again, Mr.  President, I tell you we would read in  the paper that 6,000  to 8,000 people  were murdered right after the first of  May. They would be executed without  any question. I talked to their leaders.  I saw pictures of their little tents that  they fold up and the boards they put  down to have a floor in that country  where  it  rains so hard. They carry  them on  their backs. They cannot  move very far in Nicaragua when they  are being pursued with over 100,000  people with attack helicopters, flame throwers, and every modern piece of  weaponry  that  the Soviets and  the  Cubans can pour into Nicaragua.  We are talking about $7 million in  the first installment, which would be  enough to keep that group going for  maybe 40 days. And then another $14  million which would keep them going  probably until the end of September.  Hopefully, by that time Nicaragua will  do what it says it will do. It will be  back at the OAS table. It will go back  to the Contadora process, and then we  might have some hope for restoring  peace down  there. But should  this  amendment pass, I can assure you of  one  thing. There are 100,000 people  from Nicaragua  and Costa Rica-I  have not even mentioned that. That  was a figure I got yesterday-refugees  who arrived  there within the last 6  months. Costa Rica does not know  what to do with them. We can expect,  Mr. President, half a million refugees  from Nicaragua  to  come  into  the  United States, if the Contadora proc ess stops. There is no way to stop that  flood of refugees once the executions  of the Contras take place.  I am prepared to vote, if the Senator  is prepared to vote.  ",1984

622,758,6,Mr. MATTINGLY.," Madam Presi dent, will the Senator yield?  ",1984
623,758,6,Mr. STEVENS.," I will yield in Just 1  second.  Let me say that I am disturbed by  the Senator's amendment. As I have  already indicated, it says: ""No funds       may be obligated or expended to  upgrade       any temporary facility,""  meaning that, my gosh, in Anchorage  when  they go  down  there  to 100degree weather, from 60 degrees below  in Anchorage-it never gets 60 below,  really-that is Fairbanks-make that  20 degrees below-but in any event,  when they. go down there and sudden ly they find themselves in 100-degree  weather, we  could not change  the  tents to those temporary facilities.  We  could not eliminate  the  ruts  from the 25th Hercules and make it  safe for the 26th one to land.  I just cannot understand an attempt  to make Honduras  into Vietnam.  I  think  that  the American public  is  being misled by, again, election year  rhetoric of  the kind  I  have never  heard before.  Now,  the Senator from Tennessee,  when he presented this amendment to  the Appropriations Committee, had a  legitimate proviso in it that dealt with  emergencies. This time he limits it to  facilities necessary for the evacuation  of U.S. personnel.  We do not have any people down  there to evacuate. We have up to 1,200  people there in between exercises and  they are authorized permanent facili ties,  for  the most part. That one I  mentioned, Palmerola, that is where  the permanent airbase is.  This is a snare and a delusion, this is  snake oil for a political year, and I  think we have to label it as such. I per sonally would never support turning  Honduras into some sort of a perma nent armed camp. To listen to these  people, you would  think every  little  bush is bristling with guys standing up  like they were behind hedge rows in  Europe on D-day.  These are my guys.  I know  those  guys in the Alaska Air National Guard  and I know how long they were there.  The Senator ought to know the ones  who were from Tennessee that were  down there. I bet the Senator has not  talked to them.  ",1984
624,758,6,Mr. SASSER., Will the Senator yield  on that?  ,1984
625,758,6,Mr. STEVENS., As I mentioned to  the Senator from Georgia-,1984
626,758,6,Mr. SASSER.," If the Senator will  yield,  on  the  subject of Tennessee  units,  I  think I can enlighten him.  Yes, there were units from the State  of Tennessee there. In addition to Air  National Guard units there were units  of the lOlst Airborne Division which is  Clarksville, Tenn.  ",1984
627,758,6,Mr. STEVENS.," Madam President, I  yielded to the Senator and I yield no  more.  headquarters  in Fort Campbell near  Again, I state for the record that the  unit that was there in the last exer cise, Big Pine II, from Tennessee was  the 155th Tactical Air Squadron of the  Air National Guard that was  flying  the C-130's. They ought to be interest ed  in whether a base  is capable of  taking C-130's. The reason I asked the  Senator, I hoped that he would under stand that his people were flying C130's.  I state to the Senator that I will  have a substitute to offer to conform  this to the action that the Senate has  already  taken  in  committee which  would restore the Senator's own lan guage that he offered in the Appro priations Committee to deal with the  emergencies and to delete that word  ""upgrade,"" because not being able to  upgrade the facilities that are there  now would literally prevent the use of  funds in the next fiscal year to make  these  facilities,  that are  absolutely  temporary, habitable.  I suggested to them that when I was  in China we had tents in World War  II, but we lifted them up and put a  base of wood underneath and put the  tents on top so we were able to open  them up in the bottoms in the sum mertime when  it got very hot. On  these, the only thing you can do is lift  up the flaps. And when it is raining  hard, you get all wet and if you put  them down the place just turns into  something like a steam bath. And ask  any one of  the Members who were  with us,  that  is exactly how  I  felt  when I walked through those tents that I had been in a steam bath. There  were  these young guys sitting there  and all of them were sitting in their  skivvies. There was not one of them  that was dressed. And I do not blame  them. They could not possibly even  exist inside those tents in the daytime  dressed.  Does the Senate really want to send  American servicemen, who are reserv ists and National Guard people, Army  guard people, as well as active person nel, into training in a situation where  the Department of Defense is prohib ited from taking even the simplest ac tions to upgrade the facilities for their  convenience and their use? I do not  think so.  I yield to the Senator from Georgia  such time as he may want.  ",1984
628,758,6,Mr. MATTINGLY.," Madam Presi dent,  I  thank  the  Senator  from  Alaska.  Madam President, I  rise in opposi tion to the amendment of the Senator  from Tennessee.  The amendment represents an effort  to fine tune the authorized uses of op eration and maintenance funds from  the Department of Defense to an un manageable and unnecessary degree.  The  limitations  imposed  by  the  amendment would seem  to prohibit  temporary  facilities  constructed  in  ",1984
629,771,6,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President,  I  support this amendment on impact aid  offered  by my  distinguished  col leagues. The importance of impact aid  to South Dakota is very clear. Our res ervation  schools  and  the Douglas  School,  serving Ellsworth Air Force  Base, rely heavily on impact aid as a  source of revenue. Threatening to im plement a new method of establishing  payment rates in the middle of the  year sends the wrong message to these  schools.  The impact aid school districts are  already 9 months into a budget year.  It is unfair for the U.S. Department of  Education to attempt to make rate al terations  for  the present year. The  amendment sends a clear message to  the Department: Do not change the  method for establishing payment rates  in the middle of a budget year.  There are  several  school districts  scattered across my State that have a  substantial amount of nontaxable Fed eral property. Impact aid helps com pensate for the loss of tax revenue on  this property. In some districts, most  of  the  financial  support  for  the  schools comes from impact aid. There  are simply no alternatives for  these  schools.  Many South Dakota schools would  be forced to close if Federal impact aid  assistance were discontinued. Even the  threat of major rate changes can be  very destabilizing to them. They are  constantly forced to deal with uncer tainty  about Federal  intentions  in  planning budgets.  I  have  joined  in  sponsoring this amendment because I  believe it will send a decisive message  to the U.S. Department of Education.  I urge my colleagues to join me in sup porting this amendment.  ",1984

641,784,6,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I would  like to take just a moment to explain  my vote on final passage of House  Joint Resolution 492, the urgent sup plemental bill. I  fully support emer gency food aid to Africa. I voted for  the Cochran amendment to increase  such aid by $60 million.  I support the supplemental funding  for WIC and child nutrition programs.  I cosponsored the Dixon amendment  providing $100 million  for  summer  youth employment.  I would have much preferred that  these items be considered separate and  distinct from the controversial Central  America supplemental. I am also pre pared to support the reduced level of  additional military aid for El Salvador.  However,  I do not support uncondi tioned aid to El Salvador nor the aid  to the Nicaraguan Contras.  When we began debate on this meas ure, I decided to support all amend ments attaching reasonable, and I be lieve necessary, conditions on the Sal vadoran military aid. If the aid could  be so conditioned I would support it at  the reduced level.  Unfortunately, the Senate has decid ed to provide the additional $62 mil lion in military aid for all intents and  purposes unconditionally. It has also  decided to continue to fund the Nica raguan Contras. Thus I am forced to  vote against the bill as a whole, de spite my  strong  support  for  the  worthy programs already mentioned.  LAKESHORE ROAD  ",1984
642,784,6,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, Lake shore  Road  in Manistee  County,  Mich., is in a precarious position. It is  perched on a 35-foot high bluff which  slopes dramatically into Lake Michi gan. The bluff has been eroded by  severe wave action to the point where  the  road's guardrail  is 12-feet away  from the edge of the bluff. Further  wave action this summer or a severe  storm this fall could cause the road to  collapse.  Such an occurrence would work a  hardship  on  this  rural  county  in  Michigan. Lakeshore Road presently  provides  access  to employment and  community services in the city of Man istee. Six of the ten largest employers  in the county are located in the city.  Loss of  the road would  result  in a  detour for 18 months while construc tion of an alternative route is under taken.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  has investigated the likelihood of the  road's collapse and found that protec tion of this public facility is warrant ed. On October 14, 1983,  the Office  Chief of Engineers approved a plan for  the placement of 300 feet of stone re vetment  along  the  section  of  the  eroded  bluff  supporting Lakeshore  Road. The corps determined that the  approved plan has a benefit/cost ratio  of 1.49 to 1, and a total Federal cost of  less .than $250,000.  Because  of  the potential  loss  of  Lakeshore Road  this  year,  I  feel  strongly that funding for construction  of the revetment is needed this year.  For that reason, I proposed to off er an  amendment  insuring  that  $250,000  would be available for construction.  It is my understanding from discus sions with officials of the corps, how ever, that funding could be made avail able from the section 14 account this  year, provided necessary documenta tion from the Detroit District is com pleted. I have spoken with the Detroit  District  about  the  importance  of  having the documentation completed  prior to the end of the fiscal year.   While I was pleased to learn that  funding could be made available, there  is no assurance that funding will be  provided, even if the Detroit District  completes  the necessary documenta tion before the end of the year. As a  result, I am reluctant to withdraw my  amendment.  However,  I would  like  to ask  the  chairman and ranking member of the  Appropriation's  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and Water  Development  whether they would join with me in  writing the Chief of Engineers to re quest an allocation from the section 14  account this year for construction of  the revetment? Of course, this funding  would be contingent upon the Detroit  District completing its documentation  prior to the end of the fiscal year.  ",1984
643,784,6,Mr. HATFIELD.," The Senator from  Michigan has identified a project to  which there is some urgency attached,  and I can understand his interest in  seeing funding provided this year for  construction of the revetment to pro tect Lakeshore Road. Prior  to  last  fiscal year, the existing backlog of ap proved section 14 projects would have  ordinarily  delayed  construction  of  such a project for about a year. How ever, in the jobs bill, approximately $8  million was provided for the purpose  of moving these projects to construc tion. As a result, the $4 million provid ed in the fiscal year 1984 energy and  water appropriations bill should prove  adequate to fund most of the section  14 projects which have been recently  approved and which have the neces sary documentation for construction.  I would be happy to join with the  Senator from Michigan in seeking an  allocation from the section 14 account  for this project.  ",1984
644,784,6,Mr. JOHNSTON.," As the chairman  of the Subcommittee on Energy and  Water  Development  has  already  noted, there should be adequate fund ing for a good number of section 14  projects  this fiscal year. Because of  the  importance  attached  to  this  project by the Senator from Michigan,  I would be happy to join with him in  requesting the funding.  ",1984

646,784,6,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, the re sults of elections held in El Salvador  on Sunday, March 25, 1984, are an en couraging sign that a nation torn by  internal  strife may be  turning  the  corner on  the  long  road  to peace.  Though none of  the candidates  re ceived the necessary number of votes  to preclude a runoff, a plurality of Sal vadorans did cast their ballots for a  candidate, Jose Napoleon Duarte who  has promised  to emphasize negotia tions with his adversaries and end the  violence of right wing death squads.  The elections are only a first step in  the search for peace. They  indicate  that Salvadorans, despite attempts by  leftist insurgents in various parts of  the country  to  intimidate  them, be lieve that their vote was a vote for the  future of their nation.  The  question  before  the  Senate  today does not just address the narrow  questions of whether or not to approve  additional  funds  for military assist ance to El Salvador, but rather how to  lay the foundation for a U.S. policy  which can bring about a peaceful solu tion not  only  in El Salvador but  throughout Central America.  The primary emphasis of our policy  cannot be a military solution to the  conflict in El Salvador. While training  the Armed Forces to function effec tively in a democratically elected gov ernment is important, military assist ance can only be viewed as comple mentary to diplomacy and not as an  end in itself.  We must focus our efforts on  in creasing the credibility and legitimacy  of the Contadora process. There are  many serious issues-numbers of for eign military advisers, flow of weapons  into the region, social and economic  aspects of  the crisis-which can be  ironed out by the nations of the region  themselves. There  is  nothing  easy  about negotiations; They will require  patience and real commitment. The  United States must now state its un equivocal commitment to negotiations  among all parties in the region. The  signals we  send  can no  longer be  mixed. Those who  seek peace will  become as well known as  those who  refuse to come to the table. We must  not delude  ourselves  into  believing  that military assistance is the bargain ing chip which will drive all of our ad versaries to the bargaining table.  We  are presented  today with an  emergency request for military assist ance.  I will support the compromise  crafted by my distinguished colleague  Senator INOUYE and the distinguished  majority  leader, Senator BAKER, be cause I believe the electoral results in  El Salvador justify the flexibility that  some  additional military  assistance  will provide during the period of the  election runoff.  Originally,  the administration had  requested $178 million  in additional  ",1984
647,992,6,Mr. BONIOR  of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, in the past few years, Con gress and  the people of the United  States have become increasingly aware  of the suffering of El Salvador. Inter nationally  recognized human  rights  organizations  have  documented  the  fact that nearly 40,000 noncombatant  civilians have been killed by Govern ment forces since 1979. Hundreds of  thousands of Salvadorans have  fled  the country, seeking refuge from the  political violence.  Over 18,000 Salvadorans are now  living as refugees in camps in Hondu ras where, with the help of interna tional relief organizations, they have  built an infrastructure of schools, gar dens, water systems, et cetera. Yet, the  possibility of seeking safe haven  in  Honduras  is now  in  jeopardy. The  Honduran Government has announced  plans  to  relocate  the  refugees  to a  remote area in the interior of Hondu ras.  I would like to call the attention of  my colleagues to the following article  from  the Miami Herald which de scribes some of the difficulties this re location would cause. If the relocation  goes  forward,  thousands of refugees  will no longer feel they have access to  safe haven in Honduras.  It is time for the United States to  address the refugee problem in a re sponsible manner. We must show a  new sensitivity to the human costs of  our policies in El Salvador and Hondu ras. And we must acknowledge  the  dangers  that Salvadorans who have  sought refuge in the United States will  face if our current policy of deporta tion continues.  I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation introduced by Congressman  MOAKLEY, H.R. 4447, which would sus pend  the deportation of Salvadoran  refugees, and would direct the Presi dent to report to Congress on whether  April 5, 1984  the humanitarian and security condi tions in El Salvador and other Central  American countries are safe enough to  warrant the return of these refugees.  CFrom the Miami Herald, Mar. 9, 19841  HONDURAS To MOVE REFUGEES AWAY FROM  BORDERS  <By Juan 0. Tamayo)  TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS.-Worried  about  the security of its borders, the Honduran  government is planning to relocate 18, 700  refugees-almost  all  Salvadorans-away  from the frontier and into an isolated valley  in central Honduras.  The United Nations Office of High Com missioner for Refugees <UNHCR> grudging ly has endorsed  the  forced  exodus, but  asked the government to put in writing its  promises of farmland and freedom of move ment for the refugees.  The proposed relocation underscores the  problems faced by the 18,200 Salvadoran  refugees in Honduras-a small part of the  500,000 people estimated to have fled the  tiny nation since 1979 to escape its violence.  While Honduras' conservative government  is friendly toward the 25,000 refugees who  came here from Marxist-ruled Nicaragua, it  suspects many of the Salvadorans of help ing the leftist guerrillas in their homeland.  The bodies of 12 Salvadoran men and  women who had been shot were found last  month near the Mesa Grande refugee camp,  40 miles from the Salvadoran border. The  Honduran army has said it is investigating  the slayings.  UNHCR's Tegucigalpa office said the first  phase of the refugee resettlement, to begin  in June, would relocate 8, 737 Salvadorans  and 494 Guatemalans now living in three  camps within three miles of the border with  their home countries.  The second stage will relocate 9,500 Salva dorans living in Mesa Grande, said UNHCR  deputy chief Alfredo del Rio. He stressed  that the second stage would start only if the  first was judged to be successful.  Del Rio said all the refugees would be re settled near the town of Olanchito, in a fer tile but remote and thinly populated valley  140 miles from the Salvadoran border and  111 miles from Guatemala.  The three camps to be emptied-Colomon cagua and San Antonio near El Salvador  and El Tesoro near Guatemala-will be  turned into ""reception centers,"" where Hon duran officials will process newly arrived  refugees.  Spokesmen for  the Salvadoran refugees,  who asked to remain anonymous, charged  that the relocation plan was politically mo tivated and complained it would make it dif ficult for relatives still  in El Salvador to  visit them.  They alleged  that the border area was  being cleared because U.S. and Honduran  troops planned to intervene militarily in El  Salvador's guerrilla war. Both U.S. and Hon duran officials denied any such plans.  About  troops  from  the United  States, Honduras, El Salvador and Guate mala will hold joint military maneuvers in  May and June near Cucuyagua, 28 miles  from the Salvadoran border.  The Honduran National Commission on  Refugees has denied any political motives  for the relocation and said it is designed to  move the refugees to an area where they  can grow their own food.  Del Rio said UNHCR policy was to reset tle refugees away from the border-to pro3,500  ",1984
648,1005,6,Mr. BROWN  of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I am deeply concerned about  the events of  the past week which  have taken us one step closer to an all out arms race in space. The adminis tration released a report on March 31,  entitled ""U.S. Policy on ASAT Arms  Control,""  as  required  by Congress  before $20 million in antisatellite proEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  curement funds could be released. The  report makes it clear that the adminis tration has no intention of seeking ne gotiations with the Soviet Union on  ASAT's.  Under  another  provision  passed by Congress,  the administra tion is required to endeavor ""in good  faith to negotiate a mutual and verifi able ban"" on all ASAT's before the  weapon can be tested against an object  in space.  Also disturbing was the appointment  of Air Force Lt. Gen.  James A.  Abrahamson,  formerly  associate  ad ministrator of NASA for space flight,  as the director of the Strategic De fense  Initiative <SDI>. This appoint ment  is premature in that Congress  has not yet approved funds for  this  enormously expensive program.  In a bipartisan effort to slow the ac celerating arms race in space, 19 of my  colleagues and I have formed the Coa lition for the Peaceful Uses of Space.  Noted  individuals  and organizations  are also  involved in this effort. The  coalition's objectives  include the fol lowing: Achievement of a mutual U.S. U.S.S.R. test moratorum of antisatel lite  <ASAT) weapons  and  a U.S. U.S.S.R. negotiated ban on ASATs;  achievement of a funding cap on De partment of Defense fiscal year 1985  strategic defense programs aimed or  based in space; renewed commitment  of  the United States  to  the ABM  Treaty; and finally a ban of weapons  of all kinds from or directed toward  space. I urge my colleagues to join me  in pursuing these objectives.  For nearly 40 years the nuclear arms  race  between  the  superpowers  has  been waged.  This  dangerous  and  wasteful nuclear crusade must come to  an end. At no other time in the past 40  years have we had a better opportuni ty to put a stop to arms prolif era ti on  than we do now. The growing nuclear  stockpiles  in  the United States and  U.S.S.R. have become redundant be cause of the overkill factor. Programs  to use new technologies for missile de fense, such as ASA T's and the Strate gic Defense Initiative, are still in the  initial phase of development-slowing  these programs down now would be  much easier than waiting until they  are fully operational.

[From the Peninsula Times Tribune, Mar.  11, 1984]  A Focus ON ARMs CONTROL Is MORE  REALISTIC  <By Sidney Drem  President Reagan's call to shift from de terrence based on the threat of nuclear re taliation to reliance on defense against nu clear annihilation is not new. It has been re jected before on  technical  grounds: We  simply do not know how  to build such a  shield, particularly in view of the relatively  simple steps the offense can take to defeat  it. During the earlier debates it was also re alized that the pursuit of defenses-or ABM  systems-can in fact prove harmful to our  security since each nation fears the purpose  as well as the capability of its opponent's  defenses. We may believe that our defenses  enhance  deterrence  by  diminishing  the  threat of a Soviet first strike. The Soviets,  however, may see them as evidence of U.S.  preparations for a first strike, a first strike  that would leave them with a weakened re taliatory force against which our defenses,  though imperfect, would be relatively more  effective. President Nixon gave this very ra tionale  in explaining his decision not  to  deploy a nationwide ABM system in 1969  and  in negotiating  the ABM Treaty of  SALT I that is in effect today.  Since then there have been tremendous  advances in technology, which include pro ducing directed energy beams of high power  that travel as accurate bullets at the speed  of light, and more efficient gathering, proc essing, and transmitting vast quantities of  data for the purpose of battle management.  The crucial question is whether these tech nical advances offer new promise of building  an effective defensive system,  i.e., can we  now solve the problems that led us to con clude, the last time around, that an effec tive defense was impossible?  Is it universally recognized that no single  technology offers a prospect of providing an  impenetrable shield or anti-ballistic Magi not Line. Therefore the concept of a ""de fense  in depth"" has developed-Le., a de fense with several layers based on different  technologies. The important first  layer of  this system would supposedly destroy most  of  the missiles  right  after  they  are  launched. Subsequent layers would attack  the remaining warheads high above the at mosphere, and the final layer would inter cept  the  few  survivors  during  the  last  minute or two when they re-enter the at mosphere near their targets.  However, as we look at each layer of this  defense, we encounter problems of monu mental magnitude. To  take one example,  consider a space-based system orbiting the  earth and designed to attack missiles short ly after launch. The most advanced of these  concepts envisages very high-powered lasers  and large optical systems which must oper",1984

Charles McKenna  has  been  a  member in good standing of the Twin  Cities Local 512, International Associa tion of Bridge, Structural and Orna mental Iron Workers for over 40 years  and has served as an officer of local  512 for almost 30 years.  As an officer of local 512, Chuck has  been  instrumental  in  improving  the  quality of life and education for iron workers and other Minnesotans.  In large part,  through Chuck's ef forts, a strong and vibrant apprentice ship program was created. This pro gram has provided crucial training and  employment opportunities for many.  Under the direction of the joint ap prenticeship  committee,  which  he  helped  to establish and headed,  the  success of the apprenticeship program  will continue.  Chuck has served  the members of  local 512 well. Through his efforts the  membership have a model health and  welfare program as well as a  sound  pension  plan. These  benefits  have  become a benchmark for many others.  Besides serving the local 512 mem bership, Chuck McKenna has served  the people of Twin Cities area well. As  a member of the board of directors for  the McKnight Foundation, he has  been a driving force in the good works  of that organization.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  count  on Chuck  McKenna as a good friend and adviser.  I will miss his active participation in  local 512 but know  that I can still  depend on his wise counsel and experi ence.

STENY H. HOYER  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 1984  ",1984
650,1018,6,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, last De cember our community suffered a dev astating  blow  when  the  Prince  Georges County Police Department  lost a  fine officer and  leader, Maj.  Richard Beavers. Major Beavers was  struck down in a senseless robbery at tempt as he was sitting, off duty, in a  parking lot.  The loss of Major Beavers, who was  the commander of the Oxon Hill sta tion, was a tragic and shocking event.  Major Beavers was extremely popular  with his men, . and his depth of con cern in his job and in his responsibil ities created a positive feeling  in all  who knew him.  Richard Joseph Beavers joined the  police department on October 16, 1967,  and was assigned  to  the Hyattsville  station. He was promoted to detective  in the vice section  in 1970. Further  promotions were swift-in 1972, he was  promoted  to detective  first class:  in  1974, to sergeant; in 1976 to the rank  of lieutenant; and then, in 1979 to cap tain  and  transferred  to  operations  duty officer. In 1980 he was named  commander of the Clinton District sta tion, and in 1982 to the same post at  the Oxon Hill station. He was promot ed to the rank of major posthumously  in November.  Major Beavers was born and raised  in Prince Georges County, graduating  from Northwestern High School  in  1964.  In 1970 he married Diana L.  Miller  and  they had  two  children,  Joseph Richard and Shannell Shan non.  During his service in the police de partment, Major Beavers received an  Award of Merit and 24 letters of com mendation for his work. He was con sidered one of the bright young men  of the department and he was well loved by his coworkers. At the time of  his death, he was counseling a former  employee and her family.  Clearly the motive in this senseless  killing was robbery, and two men have  been arrested and charged with Major  Beavers' murder.  ",1984

668,1083,6,Mr.  HATFIELD.," Mr.  President,  straight talk and election-year politics  seem  to be mutually exclusive. The  public has become accustomed to the  panoply of election-year  rhetoric of  the incumbents and challengers and  other  public  figures  intricately  volved  in the electoral process. This  rhetoric ranges from blatant misstate ments and untruths to the grayer area  of overstatements, exaggerations, and  misleading statements. Citizens inter ested  in  learning  about  campaign  issues often get lost in the charges and  countercharges  exchanged  and,  in  frustration,  tune out  the politicians  long before election day. This is unfor tunate, but the public is understand ably frustrated with the confusion cre ated by  the random  fire of accusa tions, allegations, and insinuations.  Therefore, it was particularly pleas ing for me to come across a speech by  Mr. Jackie Presser, general president  of the International Brotherhood of  Teamsters, the Nation's largest labor  union, which provided all of us with  some straight  talk on a subject  too  often distorted by cheap political rhet oric: unemployment. His speech spoke  of  a  creative  partnership  between  labor, management, and government  as the requisite first step in the walk  toward full employment in America.  He spoke of abandoning the counter productive  adversarial  approach  to  labor negotiations  and  employment  problem solving, and instead called for  cooperation  and  reconciliation. His  speech was a welcome reminder that  the public can respond  to highroad  politics and that our better instincts  can be challenged to improve the qual ity of life in America.  As I said, Mr. Presser's address was a  refreshing interlude from the regular  conduct of election-year politics, and I  ask unanimous consent that the text  ",1984

670,1187,6,Mr. LATTA.," Finally,  the McHugh  budget was realistic and one that we  could have implemented this year.  Following defeat of the McHugh al ternative, I  then supported the pro posal offered by Mr. MACKAY, which  was quite similar to the McHugh plan  except that it proposed to reduce the  deficit by $234 billion, as compared to  the  $262  billion  reduction  in  the  McHugh alternative.  In the wake of the def eat of both  the McHugh and MacKay budget pro posals, Mr. Speaker,  I  voted,  first,  against the Latta proposal-because of  its unacceptable 7 percent real growth  in defense spending-and then in sup port of the alternative offered by the  chairman of the Budget Committee,  ",1984
671,1187,6,Mr. JONES.,"  The  Jones budget alternative did  meet the balance test-it cuts domestic  spending by $16 billion but provides  for a 3.5-percent real increase in both  defense and entitlement spending, to  be financed by $50 billion in tax in creases. However,  I am disappointed  that  this measure does not go  far  enough in reducing the deficits. Its 3year deficit  reduction  total  is  only  $182 billion. In addition, I believe that  it  is wrong  to  take  the revenue  in creases provided in the Jones budget  and channel that revenue into more  and more  defense  and  entitlement  spending.  In my opinion,  that addi tional revenue should be earmarked  for deficit reduction, pure and simple.  However,  there was one feature of  the Jones proposal that I did find at tractive. For the first time ever,  the  House had before it a budget measure  which  officially  incorporated-albeit  in modified form-the pay-as-you-go  concept. I have been a strong propo nent of pay-as-you-go since it was first  advanced by Mr. MILLER of California  some years ago. However,  I  believe  that pay-as-you-go, as originally envi sioned, should be used to finance both  inflationary  and  real  increases  in  spending,  if indeed  the decision  is  made to increase spending at all. In  the Jones budget, unfortunately, pay as-you-go  is used merely  to  finance  real increases in defense and entitle ment spending, and thus does little to  check our deficit, much less reduce it.  Mr. Speaker, I was pleased that we  took  the  first  steps  to  reduce  the  record deficits coming at us, and  I  hope that we stay on this course, and  resolve  to  take  the more  difficult  measures which certainly lie ahead, if  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  we hope to reduce the deficits to ac ceptable  levels.

I want my tribute to be one to the  incredible partnership  that Bethine  and Frank enjoyed. It was a partner ship  of  extraordinary  effectiveness  and sensitivity, of mutual respect and  love and admiration. Frank derived  strength  from  this  partnership  in  times of setback, turmoil, and anguish,  just as he relished it during periods of  triumph and joy.  Bethine and Frank Church  as  a  team were  the best America could  produce.

673,1187,6,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Speaker, once  again Congress is focusing most of its  attention on producing a budget, with  this year's process fixated on reducing  deficits,  our  country's new  public  enemy No. 1.  Unfortunately,  little  attention  is  being paid to this country's real No. 1  problem,  jobs, or rather the lack of  jobs for those Americans who want to  work. Moreover, the budget proposed  which offers the brightest hope for ad dressing  the problem of unemploy ment and our Nation's deficit will  probably receive the fewest number of  votes when it is brought to the floor of  this body. The budget I am speaking  of is the Congressional Black Caucus  alternative budget-a proposal which  provides a real downpayment for mil lions of poor Americans by allocating  resources  for programs  that benefit  those most in need.  The 9 million people out of work,  and the 30 million people living in pov erty in this country would greatly ben efit from a number of initiatives that  are contained in the CBC alternative.  8463  Among the initiatives included in the  CBC proposal is H.R. 1036, the Com munity Renewal  Employment Act,  which passed the House last year. This  bill would provide 500,000  improve ment and service  jobs to  individuals  who have been unemployed for long  periods of time. In addition, the CBC  budget contains moneys for H.R. 5017,  the Youth Incentive Employment Act,  which would provide part-time and  full-time summer employment to eco nomically disadvantaged youth who  are  pursuing  further  education  to  training  leading  to meaningful  em ployment-a  program which would  benefit some 1 million young people.  The CBC alternative also increases  funding for the Job Training Partner ship Act <JTPA> to insure that those  who desperately want  to work will  have the chance to qualify for the po sitions  that will be available  in the  coming decades.  In the last few years social service  programs and agencies have had in creased demands placed on them for  the delivery of essential services like  food,  clothing,  and  housing, which  have  strained  their  resources  and  forced  them  to  turn away many  in  need of assistance. At the same time,  the Reagan administration has  cut  back on the very programs that exist  to benefit the needy. The CBC budget  recognizes these problems and moves  to restore much of the damage done  by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of  1981. Funds  for programs  like  the  community services block grant, title  XX, Older Americans, Volunteers  in  Service to America <VISTA>, and child  abuse prevention and treatment would  be restored and or increased under the  CBC budget.  The  final component of  the CBC  budget  that  I  consider vital  to  the  future growth of our country is a com mitment  to  the  education  of  our  young people. The CBC budget pro poses a major expansion for the suc cessful chapter I compensatory educa tion program and the vocation/adult  education program, along with resto ration of funds  for elementary and  secondary  education  programs  and  student aid. Without this investment  in our leaders of the future this coun try could well lag behind the other in dustrialized powers of the world.  The CBC alternative embodies great er compassion for the needs of disad vantaged  and  working  Americans,  fiscal  responsibility  in  terms of de fense expenditures, tax equity, control  of inflation without increasing unem ployment,  greater  attention  toward  our domestic needs, and a deficit below  that of any other alternative offered.  The Congressional Black Caucus does  not believe that the pay-as-you-go con cept  is  the way  for our country  to  return  to  the  prominence  it  once  knew, but rather supports pay as you  ",1984
674,1200,6,Mr.  SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to Harold Fallick,  the outgoing chairman of Community  Board 13, for his many years of dedi cated community service.  Mr.  Fallick  has  been  an  active  member of the community board for  the past 7 years, serving on numerous  committees and giving countless hours  of service for  the betterment of his  neighbors and his community. Four  years ago, he took on the additional  responsibilities  inherent  in  the posi tion of chairman of  the community  board and distinguished himself in the  capacity  through his  strong,  deter mined leadership and exemplary dedi cation to duty.  However, Harold Fallick  is much  more  than  a  dedicated  community  board member and officer. He has  been an active member of the Commu nity Democratic Club for many years,  and is an active member of both the  B'nai B'rith Oceanview Lodge and the  Knights of Pythias Lodge 699.  Harold Fallick also served for many  years as the trustee of the Oceanview  Jewish Center. He is a member of the  Society of Naval Architects & Marine  Engineers and an ex-officer with the  Merchant Marines. He also served his  country with honor  in both World  War II and the Korean war.  Harold Fallick represents  the best  kind of community activist; one who  gives tirelessly of himself for the bet terment of his country and his com munity.  I am indeed honored and proud to  count Harold Fallick as one of  the  leaders of the Shorefront community  and wish to congratulate him on the  occasion of the dinner-taking place  on April 12, 1984 at the Pal.ms Shore  Club-in his honor.e  SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS  Title  IV of Senate Resolution 4,  agreed to by the Senate on February  4, 1977, calls for establishment of a  system for a computerized schedule of  all meetings and hearings of Senate  committees, subcommittees, joint com mittees, and committees of conference.

684,1226,6,Mr. HUBBARD.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise iii opposition to  the  amendment  of  the  gentleman  from New York. I appreciate his con cerns and I admire his perseverence.  In addition, I  think it is fair to say  that Mr. CARNEY and I share a strong  sense of fiscal conservatism. Neither  one of us approves of inflated or run away Federal spending. I would sup port Mr. CARNEY'S amendment  if  it  stopped such spending or resulted in a  savings for the Federal Treasury, or in  some other way benefited the taxpay ers of  the United States. But  the  simple fact is, Mr. Chairman, that the  gentleman's  amendment  will  not  result  in  any  benefit whatsoever,  either financial or otherwise,  to the  United States. On the contrary,  the  gentleman's amendment  could  very  well  result  in canal  revenues' being  paid to Panama when they could be  used  to  operate  and maintain  the  canal-which we are  responsible  for  until the year 2000.  The  gentleman's  amendment  is  wrong for  two simple reasons. First,  the canal is required to generate reve nues sufficient  to cover  all  its ex penses. If the appropriation exceeds  canal  revenues,  then  they can only  spend up to  the level of their reve nues. Even if we reduce the authoriza tion, and revenues still fall below that  level,  then the canal will not spend  more than its revenues, and the gen tleman's amendment will have accom plished nothing.  Second, if we were to reduce the au thorization, and  the canal  revenues  turn out to be higher than the appro priation, then the excess revenue goes  directly to Panama. In other words, we  will be giving away money  that we  could be using to meet our responsibil ity under the treaty to maintain the  canal.  Therefore, Mr. Chairman, depending  on what the canal revenues actually  are for fiscal year 1985,  the gentle man's  amendment  will  have  no  effect-it will be useless-or it will  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  the  United States by requiring us to pay  Panama the money that we could be  using to meet our treaty obligations.  It is my understanding  that  the  Com.mission's budget  request  repre sents one of the more current agency  estimates presented  to Congress and  does  reflect  the  impact of  reduced  levels in 1983 and anticipated levels in  1984.  Information provided by Com mission officials indicates that the rev enue picture in 1984  is improving. A  month-by-month comparison can be  somewhat misleading. Although  the  first few months' revenue experience  was somewhat  lower  than  the same  period for  the previous year,  trends  experienced  in recent months would  indicate that the fiscal year 1984 reve nues will exceed the 1983 experience  by year's end.  The Commission continually reviews  and revises  its revenue forecasts.  In  addition, as further control, the U.S.  General Accounting Office provides an  annual  revenue  certification of  the  amount submitted to Congress in the  Commission's  appropriation  request.  This requirement  is over and above  what the Congress requires of other  U.S. Government agencies. The pro jected revenue, not what the Commis sion wants  to spend,  is  the primary  factor which  dictates  the Commis sion's budget development process.  Due  to world economic conditions  and other factors, canal revenues  in  recent years have declined. The Com mission management has been forced  to  implement certain cost  reduction  measures  to  reduce expenditures  to  correspond to the actual revenues re ceived. These cost reductions have af fected virtually all areas of the canal's  operation. The Commission has, how ever,  successfully  accomplished  this  while continuing to provide safe, effi cient transit service to world shipping.  It should be recognized that the Com mission must accomplish its task while  making prudent capital  investments  for future  traffic needs; maintaining  existing facilities  in operating condi tion;  and  retaining  an  adequate,  skilled work  force  to  operate  the  canal-all within  the  revenues  re ceived. The  results of  the Commis sion's operation for the first 4% years  of the treaty are evidence of the suc cess in achieving its objectives.  Some have described  the mainte nance programs for employee recrea tion as extensive. This is misleading as  the total costs in fiscal years 1984 and  1985  for  these  programs  represent  only three-tenths of 1 percent of the  total Commission budget.  Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to any  reduction in the Commission's budget.  During committee markup, the gentle man  from New York  offered  an  amendment  to  reduce  the  funding  level and  it was overwhelmingly de feated, 28 to 2. No one benefits except  possibly Panama which is paid in cash  the full amount of any Commission  profit at the end of each year. The  U.S. taxpayers save nothing. I urge my  colleagues  to  join me  in  opposing  these cuts in the overall funding level.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  ",1984
685,1226,6,Mr. SHUMWAY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amend ment offered by the gentleman from  New York <Mr. CARNEY). Many of the  reasons for that opposition have been  stated, but I  think a couple of them  need to be underlined and emphasized  before this debate comes to a close.  A similar amendment, by the way,  was offered in the full committee, and  defeated by a vote of 28 to 2.  There is no doubt that current reve nues received by  the Panama Canal  Commission are below revenues which  were received a year ago. But I hasten  to point out  to  the Members  that  when  the Commission put  together  the proposed budget for the coming  year, which we are not debating, they  took into account those factors which  have  reduced  the  traffic  flowing  through the canal. And those factors  are, of course, the worldwide recession,  which has produced a drop down  in  ",1984

",1984
692,1239,6,Mr. BOSCO.," Mr. Speaker,  today I  am introducing legislation, along with  Congressman D' AMouRs,  that  is de signed to address the controversy over  the Department of the Interior's pro posal to off er lease sales for undersea  mining on the Gorda Ridge off north ern California and Oregon. This meas ure, entitled ""the Ocean Mineral Re sources Development Act,"" would pro vide for a moratorium on Gorda Ridge  lease sales until more definitive scien tific information is gathered and ana lyzed on both the mining potential of  the site and on the environmental ef fects of such mining  In January 1984, the Minerals Man agement Service released a draft envi ronmental  impact statement <DEIS)  on the proposed lease sales. Although  the DEIS covered potential mining on  68,000 square miles beginning some 20  to 40 miles offshore, Interior has since  scaled back the proposed lease sales by  90 percent and postponed the actual  leasing until at least January 1985.  Both the DEIS and the entire leas ing plan have come under intense criti cism from environmental, fishing, and  State and  local  interests. Moreover,  the mining industry itself has viewed  the lease plan with much skepticism  and hesitancy. This widespread oppo sition to the first major non-oil or gas  offshore mineral lease is premised on  the fact that leasing at this time, for  many reasons, would be premature.  Adequate  scientific  information  is  essential  to provide a basis for  rea soned decisionmaking. As yet, howev er, there is no definitive evidence of  polymetallic sulfide minerals,  includ ing such strategic minerals as copper,  zinc,  chromium,  silver,  platinum,  nickel, and cobalt on the Gorda Ridge.  Also, as Interior's DEIS showed, very  little is known about the overall physi cal, chemical, and biological environ ment of the Gorda Ridge.  Without such scientific information,  industry  has  been  understandably  hesitant to invest capital in the type  of exploration technology necessary to  undertake  a  successful mining ven ture-particularly  at  a  time when  there is a worldwide glut of polymetal lic sulfides. In any event, it is widely  accepted  that  the  technology neces sary  for actual mining will not be  available for at least 20 years.  At the same time, concerned citizens  in California and Oregon have recog nized that an adequate assessment of  environmental  impacts  cannot  be  made until more is known about the  ore source and mining methods to be  used in development. The possible de struction of the ocean-bottom ecosys tem is of obvious concern, as are the  possible onshore pollutant effects of  polymetallic processing plants.  The commercial fishing industry, an  economic mainstay  of  California's  north coast, has also raised strong con cern over the possible effects of heavy  metal discharges on  the ocean  food  chain. The proposed  lease sale will  take  place  in  an  area of valuable  salmon, albacore, and steelhead fish ery resources, and thus more informa tion is needed on the type of extrac tion technology to be used.  Also, serious questions remain unan swered as to which Federal agency has  jurisdiction over the polymetallic min erals on the Gorda Ridge. While Inte rior  claims  jurisdiction  under  the  Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act  <OCSLA),  the Department of Com merce has historically been assigned  jurisdiction  over  the  commercial  mining of manganese nodules on the  deep seabed  from  the Deep Seabed  Hard Minerals Resources Act. This  discrepancy should be resolved before  any further research, scientific stud ies, or actual lease sales pertinent to  the Gorda Ridge area are undertaken.  Resolution of this jurisdictional prob lem should also facilitate coordination  and communication with State and  local agencies.  Finally, with little industry interest,  a  lack of basic  information, and a  worldwide glut of polymetallics, there  is reason to doubt that the Govern ment can receive anything approach ing ""fair market value"" for leases on  the Gorda Ridge. At this  time, bids  may be accepted for as little as 5 cents  an acre.  For all of these reasons, I agree with  the  overwhelming  public  consensus  that  leasing  of  the Gorda Ridge  should be delayed until  the Federal  Government resolves the many unan swered questions and concerns raised  by industry and the citizens of Califor nia and Oregon. The Ocean Minerals  Resources Development Act  is  de signed to meet these concerns.  First,  this act would prohibit lease  sales on the Gorda Ridge until such  time as the President issues a feasibili ty report to the Congress and the pro hibition is lifted by joint resolution, or  until September 30, 1988, whichever  occurs earlier.  Second,  the Department of Com merce and the Department of the In terior would be authorized to prepare  a memorandum of understanding with  respect to research and other scientific  studies pertinent to the Gorda Ridge.  This MOU is to be submitted to Con gress no later than 1 year after enact ment.  Third, the President is to submit a  Gorda Ridge feasibility report to Con gress no  later  than September 30,  1987. The preparation of this report  during the moratorium should lay a  sufficient scientific  foundation upon  which  future governmental and pri vate industry decisions can be based.  Among other things, the report must  contain a summary of the physical and  tion of what, if any, additional techbiological environment, a  determina ",1984
693,1252,6,Mr.  PROXMIRE.," Mr.  President,  April is an important month for Arme nians. I have recently read in the Ar menian Weekly that in Rhode Island  alone the Armenian community along  with the Armenian National Commit tee have planned a series of projects to  commemorate the 69th anniversary of  the 1915 Armenian Genocide by the  Turkish Government.  In addition to rallies, billboards, tele vision  programs,  and proclamations  from the mayor and Governor, a dis play will be  featured  in  the Rhode  Island State House rotunda. This ar rangement will  inform the public of  the genocide of the Armenians and its  serious implications.  American awareness of the horrors  of genocide beyond the Nazi mass ex termination of 6 million Jews during  World War II, is not very great. Many  do not even know what  the word  ""genocide"" means. The intentional de struction  of  any  national,  ethnic,  racial or religious group is not some thing  to which  the world  should  remain ignorant.  I commend the Rhode Island Arme nians for their efforts to raise aware ness to their cause. The devastating  slaughter of 1.5 million Armenians by  the Turks cannot be overlooked. The  United States cannot disregard  this  tragic lesson of history.  Unfortunately, this first genocide of  our century has not been  the  last.  Moreover, it was not until 1948 that  the world finally recognized the need  for an international treaty outlawing  genocide for all times. Worse yet, to  this very day the United States has refused  to ratify this essential human  rights treaty.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues  to take a hard look at history. The  need for the Genocide Convention is  evident. Let us no longer ignore the  lessons of the past. We must ratify the  Genocide Convention.  RECOGNITION OF SENATOR  KASTEN  ",1984

695,1252,6,Mr. KASTEN.," Mr. President, today  is my sixth speech on the voting prac tices  in  the United Nations. These  statements to my colleagues are based  on the first annual report prepared by  the Department of State. These  re ports are required by a Federal  law  that I authored in 1983-Public Law  98-151. Last week, in my remarks on  the reaction to events in Grenada by  the United Nations,  I  cited a  very  thoughtful  article on  the Grenada  matter in relation to international law  by University of Virginia law professor  John Norton Moore. The article  is  published in the January 1984 issue of  the American Journal of International  Law.  Criticizing the U.N. General Assem bly's rush to  judge the joint United  States-OECS action in Grenada as a  flagrant violation of international law,  Professor Moore carefully demonstrat ed the  legality of the action. More over, he warned that ""an international  legal double standard is eroding the  foundations of the international legal  order.""  Professor Moore went so far as to  warn  that  the United Nations may  visit upon itself the fate of the I..eague  of Nations unless it should ""abandon  the international double standard and  rigorously apply the great principles  of the U.N. Charter.""  The double  standard  is  no more  starkly evident than in the U.N. As sembly's treatment uf human rights in  El Salvador. Through annual resolu tions selectively drawing attention to  imperfections  in El Salvador's social  and political order,  the General As sembly contributes to the campaign to  legitimize  the Marxist-Leninists who  are seeking to violently overthrow the  legitimate elected Government of El  Salvador.  The U.N. Charter, in its preamble,  affirms:  Faith in fundamental human rights,  the dignity and worth of the h~an person,  in the equal rights of men and women and  of nations large and small.  in  The U.N.'s Universal Declaration on  Human Right.a addresses the issue of  fundamental human  rights  in ways  not dissimilar from  the Judea-Chris tian ethical tradition or the teachings  of  the American Founding Fathers:  Among these are the right to life; to  personal  liberty;  to  immunity  from  unjust  imprisonment or  torture  or  other degrading  treatment;  religious  liberty; and  the freedom  to exercise  one's conscience.  As a juridical concept, human rights  are meaningful only  insofar as  they  are  equally  applied. To  selectively  assail the human rights record of some  governments and not those of others is  to undermine  the very  concept of  human rights standards. It is for this  reason, incidentally, that the 1961 For eign Assistance Act, which provides  for the State Department to furnish  annual  country-by-country  human  rights reports, mandates that such re porting be  for all countries and, of  course, on the basis of equal stand ards. Selectivity in monitoring human  rights dishonors  the very  rights  it  claims to champion.  The annual U.N. General Assembly  debate and vote on El Salvador is a  crucial instance of the sort of hypocri sy that Professor Moore has warned  may cause the organization to destroy  itself. As  the  State Department's  Report to Congress on Voting Prac tices in the United Nations shows, last  year, the General Assembly approved  a resolution expressing ""deepest con cern"" that ""the gravest violations of  human rights are persisting in El Sal vador."" The tally was: 84 in favor; 14,  including the United States, opposed;  and 45 abstaining.  Our Government opposed the reso lution, in part, because it believed it  was one step in a campaign to delegiti mize the lawful, elected Government  of El Salvador. More importantly, the  United States opposed the resolution  because it was so absurdly unbalanced,  and so grossly symptomatic of the new  international double standard.  By this double standard, it is permis sible  for  terrorist, Communist-affili ated forces calling themselves national  liberation movements-the PLO and  SW APO,  for  instance, and also  the  Salvadoran Communists, the FMLN to use violence  in pursuit of  their  aims. But it is impermissible for law fully elected governments  to def end  themselves against  the  f oreign-spon sored subversion.  The General Assembly never consid ers, much less votes to approve, resolu tions of concern over human rights in  Ethiopia, where Amnesty Internation al reported that the Marxist regime  actually had boiled hight school stu dents in oil. Indeed, in the often topsy turvy moral world of the United Na tions, the Ethiopian delegates recently  have accused us of gross violations of  human rights.  ",1984
696,1265,6,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, the  simple and plainly visible truth about  our covert assistance  to  the Nicara guan Contras is that the chief use to  which it is being put-an attempt to  overthrow the Government of Nicara gua-violates U.S.  and  international  law. That is a clear and undisputable  fact, evident to anyone who looks at  the record.  What the Reagan administration is  doing in Nicaragua is discrediting the  United States in the eyes of all those  who we ask to believe in respect for  the law.  It is undermining our efforts to call  the attention of the world and of our  own people to the fact of international  terrorism, and to condemn and combat  it.  In short, our covert assistance to the  Contras is destroying our credibility.  It is not difficult to see why.  This program, as it is being operat ed, violates article 2(4) of the Charter  of the United Nations, a multilateral  treaty  ratified by  the Senate. This  treaty prohibits the threat or use of  force against the territorial integrity  or independence of any state.  ",1984

702,1304,6,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President, the  recent resignation of President Ricar do  de  la Espriella of Panama has  raised some speculation that the gen eral elections may not take place on  May 6 as scheduled. Although the new  President has pledged to adhere to the  commitment to hold elections on that  date, concern has been voiced that a  political battle  in  the Panamanian  Cabinet may prompt the military to  interfere with the May 6 schedule.  Panama  has  made  significant  progress over the past 4 years toward  the adoption of a democratic govern ment. It would be a serious setback if  the country were deprived of its first  general  election  since  the military  seized power in 1968.  The evolution toward civilian rule in  Panama has been marked by a  tenu ous and uneasy  truce between  the  country's military and civilian political  leaders. It is clear from de la Espriel la's sudden resignation that this his torical conflict has not been resolved.  The political stability of Panama must  not be jeopardized by any efforts to  thwart the country's mandated pro gression toward free elections. Inter nal disruptions in Panama's status quo  would have severe negative ramifica tions for the already fragile region of  Central America.  It is the sincere hope of this Sena tor, therefore, that the transition to  democratic rule will be permitted to  take place without  impediment. The  role of  the military  in Panamanian  Government should be decided by its  citizens. A distortion of  their voice  would seriously undermine the credi bility of those who profess to repre sent them.  FRANK CHURCH  ",1984
703,1304,6,Mr.  DECONCINI.," Mr.  President,  much  that has been written about  Frank Church has to do with his many  accomplishments as a young man.  I  did not know him then; yet it is evi dent that the notoriety which came to  him in those years only enhanced his  gifts of generosity and concern.  He was  in his ripening middle age  when I  came to the Senate, and my  most enduring memories of him will  be of the care he showed me as a very  junior Member of this body. He took  the time to care about me and other  younger Members. When I began to  venture  into  foreign  policy  issues,  Chairman Church had no hesitation  in offering to conduct hearings on my  areas of concern. Because he so freely  offered  opportunities  to work with  him, I began to seek out his opinions  on foreign policy. Many of the views I  strongly  cling  to  today  developed  during those periods when I as a very  junior Member of  the Senate could  freely discuss my concerns with  the  chairman of the Senate Foreign Rela tions Committee.  As Frank Church  and  I  became  friends, I gained the added pleasure of  knowing his wonderful wife, Be thine.  She is a woman of warmth and dedica tion. Her relationship with Frank has  been an inspiration to many Members  of the Senate and their families. We  are all pained by the sadness of her  loss.  Mr. President, I was a better Senator  because of Frank Church, and we are  a more caring and conscientious body  because of the time he spent here. His  departure from us, from all who loved  him, brings so much sadness. It also  fills this Senator with the resolve to  help perpetuate  the spirit of Frank  Church in this body.  THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF  PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION  ",1984
704,1304,6,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, I would  like to commend my colleagues for the  wisdom they showed in passing H.R.  3249 to charter the National Academy  of Public Administration. The charter  should insure that the National Acade my is called upon even more frequent ly for its expertise in advising govern ment on more effective management  of complex issues and institutions.  Since 1967  the National Academy  has been a trusted, experienced coun selor to government at all levels-Fed eral, State, and  local.  It has served  government  on  the  administrative  side, much as the National Academy of  Sciences has been a resource on scien tific matters. In 1863, President Lin coln signed legislation chartering the  National Academy of Sciences, now a  significant landmark on America's in tellectual landscape. It is only fitting  that its sister institution, the National  Academy of Public Administration, is  now receiving a charter.  Chaired by Phillip S. Hughes, Under  Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu tion, the National Academy is made up  of more than 300 distinguished practi tioners and scholars  in  the field of  public administration. They included  former Cabinet members and Gover nors, current White House officials,  Members  of  Congress,  government  managers,  and  businessmen  and  women who were  formerly  govern ment officials.  Their  broad  collective  experience  provides  governmental  institutions  with thoughtful, objective counsel.  The National Academy  has  per formed services or conducted studies  for  the Congress, the Judiciary, and  nearly every department and major  agency of the Federal Government, as  well as State and local governments.  Over the years  the National Aero nautics  and  Space  Administration  alone has called upon it for 11 studies.  Last year 16 Federal agencies joined to  ask the National Academy for ways to  streamline management and  regula tions, avoid overburdening of systems,  and motivate Federal managers. A  recent report made recommendations  on ways  to  improve the Presidential  appointment process.  These are only a few of the contribu tions the National Academy has made  toward helping our public institutions  work more efficiently. As a chartered  institution, it will be called upon even  more frequently for assistance.  CHILDREN AGAINST THE NUKES  ",1984
705,1304,6,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, on nu merous occasions in the past I have  expressed my concern over the materi als that are being used in the class rooms of our Nation to  indoctrinate  the impressionable minds of our chil dren. On July 20, 1983, I spoke to this  body on the curriculum developed by  the National Education Association,  ""Choices,"" which offered little or no  choice at all but to conclude that we  are about to be blown up. You may  recall that in my floor statement, I  called attention to the deluge of let ters written to President Reagan by  frightened  schoolchildren  worried  about their chances of growing up.  In recent days, Mr. President, Secre tary Bell has expressed his concern for  what he calls the ""dumbing down"" of  textbooks. He deplores the lack of aca demic sophistication in the materials  currently available from textbook pub lishers. While I share that concern, I  am much more alarmed about the con tent, or the substance, of what lies be tween the covers of increasing num bers of  the books our children are  using.  .  For  that reason,  I  also share  the  concern of Congresswoman RoUKEMA  of New Jersey, as expressed on the  House floor on March 8, 1984, when  her amendment was added to the voca tional education  reauthorization bill  prohibiting  the National Education  Association  from profiting from  the  ""teacher certified"" computer software  to be merchandised by its affiliate whatever that is-Cordatum. While I  certainly join in the Congresswoman's  conflict-of-interest  remarks  on  the  matter, I am much more alarmed at  the prospect of NEA selected teachers  putting the stamp of approval on the  ",1984
706,1317,6,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, it is my  privilege to introduce, in conjunction  with Senator SPECTER,  the Pennsylva nia Wilderness Act of 1984. Over the  past 10 years since the passage of the  Eastern Wilderness Act of 1974, many  individuals from Pennsylvania, as well  as  those  residents  of  neighboring  States who enjoy the scenic splendor  and recreational pastimes of our State,  have sought to establish a wilderness  area in the Allegheny National Forest.  This dream now seems close to realiza tion, but it will still require continu ation  of  the  type  of  commitment  which has been shown to date.  Among those who have worked hard  for Pennsylvanians  to  achieve  this  end, Congressman BILL CLINGER  de serves special recognition for his ef forts.  Congressman  CLINGER  has  worked tirelessly to achieve a wilder ness designation for the Allegheny Na tional Forest. His efforts have created  a genuine consensus. The wilderness  proposal he has been so careful in pre paring has made every possible effort  to accommodate the various interests  of those whom it would most directly  affect. The legislation strikes a reason able  balance  by  leaving  significant  areas  of  the  Allegheny  National  Forest open to various types of devel opment while protecting those parts  with  the highest wilderness,  scenic  and recreational values.  Congressman CLINGER,  in conjunc tion with the efforts and cosponsor ship  of Congressman  PETER KosT MA YER, has introduced H.R. 5076, the  Pennsylvania Wilderness Act of 1984.  This legislation which Senator SPEC TER and I introduce today will parallel  the efforts of Congressmen CLINGER  and KOSTMAYER in the House of Rep resentatives.  The Pennsylvania Wilderness Act  provides for a variety of different land  uses based on the adoption of two land  use designations  the  forest. The  in  first area includes seven islands on the  Allegheny River designated as the Al legheny Islands Wilderness, an area of  363 acres, and a far larger forest area  of  northern  hardwoods  called  the  Hickory Creek wilderness area, cover ing 9,400 acres. These areas qualify as  potential wilderness areas based on  U.S. Forest Service surveys conducted  in the roadless areas review and eval uation II <RARE ID.  The bill also proposes an Allegheny  National Recreation Area of 23,100  acres, which includes areas identified  and depicted  in RARE  II as Corn planter, Tracy Ridge, and Allegheny  Front. This national recreation area  also includes the northern part of the  Allegheny Reservoir.  Also  included are special provisions  to deal with the fact that the subsur face rights for oil, gas, and minerals  beneath  the designated areas are  in  some  cases  privately  owned.  Such  holdings are not unique to the Alle gheny National Forest, as many na tional forests  in the Eastern United  States were first created by acquiring  only the surface rights to the land. As  a wilderness area is intended to remain  virtually  untouched  by  civilization,  preserved as it is in a wild state, the  bill provides a mechanism for acquir ing these mineral rights still held by  private individuals and located within  the designated area and authorizes ap proximately $2 million for acquisition  of mineral  rights owned by private  parties and located beneath the area  called Hickory Creek. Such acquisi tions will greatly reduce the problems  the Forest Service faces in maintain ing the quality of the wilderness areas  within the Allegheny National Forest.  The designation of other areas as  the Allegheny National Recreation  Area <ANRA>  recognizes  that while  sufficient revenues are not available to  purchase  all  the  interests  in  these  areas, it is still desirable to preserve  these areas whenever possible for rec reational uses. The Secretary of Agri culture  is directed under the bill  to  formulate  management  plans  for  ANRA that maximize recreation op portunities and protect all forms of  fish and wildlife. At the same time, ex ploration for minerals, oil, and gas can  be undertaken  in  a manner which  most effectively protects the environ ment from damage, while allowing for  an accommodation of development for  energy.  In my position as a member of the  Energy and Natural Resources Com mittee to which this bill will be re f erred,  I  look  forward  to working  closely with my colleagues  in estab lishing this wilderness and recreation  area  so  that  Pennsylvanians  and  others can fully enjoy, both now and  for generations  to come,  the many  areas of beauty and splendid seclusion,  together with the valuable and varied  recreational opportunities of the Alle gheny National Forest.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of the bill be printed at this point.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  s. 2551  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled,  SHORT TITLE  SECTION 1. This Act may be cited as the  ""Pennsylvania Wilderness Act of 1984"".  FINDINGS  SEC. 2. The Congress finds and declares  that( 1) there is an urgent need to identify and  protect natural areas  to meet  the  recre ational needs of Americans;  (2) certain lands within the Allegheny Na tional Forest in Pennsylvania are worthy of  inclusion in the National Wilderness Preser vation System; and  (3) certain other lands within  the Alle gheny National Forest are suitable for des ignation as a national recreation area.  PURPOSE  SEC. 3. It is the purpose of this Act to( 1) establish the Allegheny Islands Wil derness and the Hickory Creek Wilderness;  (2)  establish  the Allegheny  National  Recreation Area so as to assure the preser vation and protection of the area's natural,  scenic, scientific, historic, archaeological, ec ological, educational, watershed and wildlife  values and to provide for the enhancement  of  recreational opportunities, particularly  undeveloped recreational opportunities; and  (3) assure that any mineral exploration  and development  that  takes place within  the recreation area is done in an environ mentally sound manner.  WILDERNESS DESIGNATION  SEc. 4. (a) In furtherance of the purposes  of  the Wilderness Act <78 Stat. 890;  16  U.S.C. 1131-1136), the following lands in the  State of Pennsylvania are hereby designated  as wilderness and therefore as components  of  the National Wilderness Preservation  System:  ( 1) certain lands in the Allegheny Nation al Forest, Pennsylvania, which comprise ap proximately three hundred and sixty-three  acres, as generally depicted on a map enti tled  ""Allegheny  Islands Wilderness-Pro posed"",  dated March  1984,  composed of  Crulls Island, Thompsons Island, R. Thomp sons Island, Courson Island, King Island,  Baker  Island, and No Name  Island, and  which shall be known as the Allegheny Is lands Wilderness; and  (2) certain lands in the Allegheny Nation al Forest, Pennsylvania, which comprise ap proximately nine  thousand  four hundred  acres as generally depicted on a map enti tled ""Hickory Creek Wilderness-Proposed"",  dated March  1984,  and which  shall  be  known as the Hickory Creek Wilderness.  Cb) Subject to valid existing rights,  the  wilderness areas designated under subsec tion Ca> shall be administered by the Secre tary of Agriculture <hereinafter in this Act  referred to as the ""Secretary"") in accord ance with the provisions of the Wilderness  Act governing areas designated by that Act  as wilderness, except that any reference in  such provisions to the effective date of the  Wilderness Act shall be deemed to be a ref erence to the effective date of this Act.

707,1330,6,Mr. EAST.," Mr. President, last week,  on April 3, 1984, the African National  Congress <ANC), a Communist Party dominated  terrorist  organization  in  the Republic of South Africa, was re sponsible for two car bomb explosions  in the morning rush hour of Durban,  South Africa. These explosions killed  3 persons and seriously  injured 22.  The ANC was the subject of an inten sive investigation in 1982 by the Sub committee on Security and Terrorism  of  the Committee on  the Judiciary,  and the subcommittee found, based on  the sworn testimony of former mem bers of the ANC and of the South Af rican Communist Party, that both the  South African Communist Party as  well as the Soviet Union and East Ger many have played roles  in funding,  training, and providing propaganda as sistance for the ANC and its terrorism.  The New York Tribune, in a series of  articles by Doris H. Gray of the Tri bune's  foreign  affairs  staff, makes  clear the Soviet and Communist con nections of the ANC and its terrorism.  While some Americans have been vic timized by a campaign of disinforma tion about the ANC and its goals, the  series in the Tribune offers a factual  and accurate view of what these anti Western Communists are seeking and  of how they are pursuing the goal.  I ask that the articles from the New  York Tribune of March 5, 6, and 9,  1984 be printed in the RECORD.  The articles follow:  [From the New York Tribune, Mar. 5, 19841  SOUTH AFRICAN ""LIBERATION"" GROUP BACKED  BY SOVIETS, ACCORDING TO DEFECTORS  <By Doris H. Gray>  JOHANNESBURG, SouTH AFRICA.-The Afri can National Congress CANC>  of South  Africa-sometimes  regarded as a  genuine  liberation movement fighting for the rights  of the politically deprived black majority in  the country-is in fact a Soviet-influenced,  communist front organization, according to  the South African security police.  Many of the ANC attacks are planned and  orchestrated by white international terror ists and not local black idealists who seek to  counter the oppression of their people, secu rity police said.  Evidence  to  support  these  claims was  given by former ANC members who defect ed and by security men who successfully in filtrated the ANC or related organizations  and  rose  to high positions within  their  ranks.  The ANC  experienced a major setback  with the recent peace talks between South  Africa and Mozambique.  Marxist Mozambique, immediate neighbor  of South Africa and base of operations for  the ANC and its military wing ""Umkhonto  We Sizew [Spear of the Nation],"" agreed to  withdraw  its military  support  from  the  group in return for substantial economic aid  from the South African government.  South Africa, in tum, promised to stop its  support of the Mozambican National Resist ance Movement <MNR>,  an organization  aimed at destabilizing the Marxist govern ment.  MOSCOW CONFUSED  Security sources in Pretoria claim to have  information about ""serious confusion""  in  Moscow and leading ANC circles at their  headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, as a result  of these moves.  During  the  past  few weeks,  formerly  staunch allies of the violent ANC approach  to change  in South Africa seem  to have  turned their backs on the organization and  are choosing to sit at the negotiating table  with South Africa.  For the past 20 years, ANC activities have  not brought about any hoped-for change in  the apartheid system.  President Kertneth Kaunda of Zambia in  late February  said  independent African  states even would welcome South Africa  into  the Organization  for African Unity  COAU) and the Southern African Develop ment Cooperation Conference CSADCC),  once independence is granted to South West  Africa <Namibia) and South African troops  are withdrawn from Angola.  However, Augusto Macamo, member of  the ruling Frelimo Party central committee  in Mozambique, said his country will contin ue ""to be in solidarity with the struggle of  the South African people,"" and that ""the  solidarity  between Mozambique  and  the  ANC  is  sealed with  bloodshed  for  the  common cause of peace and equality.""  Blood indeed has been shed: During the  past 7 years, 217 incidents were reported, in  the course of which 48 people were killed  and damage amounting to $550 million oc curred, according to figures of the South Af rican police.  Violence has been countered with intensi fied police activity by  the South African  government. Since 1977, 172 trained terror ists have been ""neutralized,"" of whom 127  were  arrested  and  45  killed,  the police  report said. Most of these  terrorists were  said to be linked to the ANC.  Increasingly,  violence  is  directed  indis criminately against targets where civilians,  black and white, get killed.  A well-known white South African lawyer,  Joe  Slovo,  suspected  of  being  a KGB  member, planned most of the sabotage acts  carried out by Umkhonto We Sizwe,  the  ANC military wing. Slovo, who used to work  out of Mozambique,  reportedly  left  the  ",1984
708,1343,6,Mr. BARNES.," Mr. Speaker, a recent  article in the Christian Science Moni tor  charges  that  ""the  Salvadoran  armed forces have used the Red Cross'  humanitarian activities to locate and  attack groups of displaced people in  areas of conflict.""  The article alleges that Salvadoran  Air Force planes have attacked groups  of people who were gathered at sites  where the International Committee of  the Red Cross had informed the Salva doran Government that it was going  to deliver relief supplies at a certain  time. Sometimes the Red Cross is pre vented from going to the site at the  last minute so the planes are free to  attack  the  people  gathered  there;  sometimes the planes attack after the  Red Cross has completed the delivery  and left.  In either case, these people are at tacked indiscriminately, on the mere  assumption  that their presence  in a  conflict area makes them actual or po tential guerrilla sympathizers.  Human  rights organizations  in El  Salvador and the United States have  been saying for some  time that this  was  occurring,  but  this  is,  to my  knowledge, the first independent con firmation by a journalist.  Mr. Speaker, I wish  the State De partment would stop blandly denying  that  this kind of  thing occurs, and  would instead use its considerable in fluence to stop this despicable behav ior on the part of the recipients of our  aid.  The article follows:  [From the Christian Science Monitor, Mar.  26, 1984]  EL SALVADOR MILITARY SAID TO BOMB RED  CROSS AID SITES  <By Chris Hedges>  SUCHITOTO, EL SALVADOR.-The Salvador ean Armed Forces  have  used  the Red  Cross's humanitarian activities to locate and  8619  attack groups of displaced people in areas of  conflict.  This is the charge leveled at the armed  forces, especially the Salvadorean Air Force,  by two well-placed Western officials and by  residents interviewed in the conflict zones.  Because of these attacks keyed to relief  deliveries by the International Committee  of the Red Cross, the ICRC suspended med ical and food deliveries  last December  to  most of  the northern part of Cuscatlan  Province and northeastern Cabanas Prov ince.  The attacks began in September at a rate  of roughly  two  to  three per month. The  latest occurred about four weeks ago in Pe peshtenango, one of the towns where the  ICRC has continued to make deliveries.  The spokesperson in El Salvador for the  ICRC, which provides $11 million of relief  assistance to this country annually, has re fused to comment on the suspension of med ical and food deliveries.  But sources say some attacks have oc curred on places where the ICRC made de liveries only hours after ICRC vehicles de parted.  At other times,  these sources add, ICRC  vehicles have not been permitted to reach  scheduled delivery points. People waiting  for ICRC visits, these sources say, have then  come under fire from Air Force helicopters  and planes and even, at times, from ground  troops. Those who say they were attacked  contend they were not informed of any aid  cancellation.  A spokesman for  the Salvadorean Joint  Chiefs of Staff, when asked about charges  that the military has used ICRC operations  to locate bombing targets, said: ""I don't be lieve it. That's a lie.""  That spokesman, Capt. Luis Mario Aguilar  Alfaro, also asserted that the people in the  conflict zones are massas-groups of un armed civilians who provide logistical sup port for the guerrillas and who often live in  close proximity to guerrilla camps.  ""The massas are the same as the guerril las,"" he said, ""They are not innocent.""

709,1356,6,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, it is my  honor to note in the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD five individuals being honored  by the Black United Service Clubs of  Johnstown at their fifth annual spring  premiere awards banquet.  This year five more individuals are  being honored for their commitment  to the Johnstown community, the ad vancement of citizens within the com munity, and  for  their  leadership  in  promoting racial harmony within the  area.  I would briefly like to mention each  of these individuals and the outstand ing work they have done.  Capt. Donald Peterson: Captain Pe terson and his  family have devoted  their lives to helping people through  the outstanding work of the Salvation  Army. Captain Peterson has worked  for the Salvation Army for the last 35  years, and also has a daughter who is a  Salvation Army officer. I well remem ber during the disastrous 1977  flood  the firsthand look that our own com munity got at the excellent work the  Salvation Army does day in and day  out throughout the troubled spots of  world, and it is a pleasure to congratu late Captain Peterson on his continu ing effort in helping people through  this organization and his work as a  member of the Rotary Club and minis terial.  Miss Claudia B. Jones: I remember  seeing Miss Jones on the local televi sion station where she was the original  hostess of ""Challenge,"" a public serv ice  program  sponsored  by  the  Women's Auxiliary of the Johnstown  Branch of the NAACP. But that was  just the most visible of a community  commitment by Miss Jones that has  also seen her efforts as adviser to the  University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown  Chapter of the NAACP, her develop ment of  the program for  the Black  Family Workshop, and as a member of  the Mount Sinai Institutional Baptist  Church  her  organization  of  the  women's day program, youth program,  and senior choir. It is  through such  community involvement that countless  lives are enriched and individual lives  enchanced, and it is a pleasure to congratulate Miss Jones for her fine work.  Mrs. Faye G. M. Griffin: I am hon ored to have close ties with the Inter national  Ladies Garment Workers  Union, and Mrs. Griffin  is a  former  chairperson of that organization and  worked for 37 years at the Cay Artley  Garment Factory as a presser. It is an  indication  of  her  commitment  to  family and community that she also  found  time to attend UPJ part time  until she received her degree, chaired  the prospect area development com mittee, and has held numerous posi tions  in  the Pleasant Hill Baptist  Church. She has also worked for the  Greater Johnstown Affirmative Action  Council and with the CETA program  until she retired last year. Though for mally retired, her record shows that  her spirit and commitment will never  retire, and it is a pleasure to see her  honored by this award.  Mr. Saul Griffin: I guess no one can  fully appreciate the efforts and energy  of an elected public official as much as  someone else who has the honor to  serve, and I certainly remember per sonally the work of Mr. Saul Griffin  on  the  city  council. Along with  a  career  at  Bethlehem  Steel  that  spanned 46 years, Mr. Griffin was a  leader of local and State NAACP ef forts and has served  three  terms at  chairperson. Mr. Griffin also served on  the city charter commission and has  been  active with  the Pleasant Hill  Baptist Church. His public service and  community record is certainly fitting  for the receipt of this honor.  Mr. Anthony Genovese: And post humously, an award goes to Mr. An thony Genovese who served the com munity time and time again until his  death a little over a year ago. Mr. Gen ovese worked with the Senior Commu nity Services Center,  he was  past  chairperson of the Kernville Improve ment Committee, he was actively in volved with  the St. Vincent DePaul  Society and Operation Touch, and he  served as  executive director of  the  Cambria County Housing Corp. The  work of Mr. Genovese touched thou sands of lives in the Johnstown area,  and the good works he accomplished  will benefit the lives of these citizens  for many years to come.  Besides my congratulations  to  all  these awardees, I also want to add my  congratulations to Mr. Allan Andrews  and  the United  Service  Clubs  of  Johnstown for  the outstanding work  they are doing with the banquet  to  promote the community's harmony.e  IRS AND THE TAX PROTEST  MOVEMENT  HON.

711,1369,6,Mr. ADDABBO.," Mr. Speaker,  the  First Baptist Church of Far Rock away, NY,  recently  honored  their  pastor and spiritual  leader Rev. H.  Oliver Scott for his 25 years of service  to his church and the community.  Reverend Scott is a man to be ad mired  for his strong determination,  large  heart,  true  faith,  and  ready  hands. He has always offered himself  to his community and congregation.  He has sought  to  involve others  in  helping themselves and helping their  community as well. His weekly radio  broadcasts have reached hundreds of  thousands of people in New York.  During his 25 years at the First Bap tist Church, Reverend Scott has orga nized 12 auxiliaries that continuously  assist in providing necessary communi ty services. He has offered people edu cation and  reorganized  the Sunday  school at the church, in addition to be ginning a Bible school. Reverend Scott  has also been instrumental in setting  up a scholarship fund to help you.1'.lg  people afford an education.  His leadership and dedication span  over 58 years in the pastorate and set  an example for all citizens. Through  his guidance and spiritual strength he  has inspired us to achieve our goals  and has helped improve the quality of  life in our community.  I  take great pride in serving as the  Member of Congress who represents  Reverend Scott and his congregation.  It is his leadership that makes Amer ica a great country and supports a  strong democracy.

722,10,14,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, on June  18, 1984, El Al Israel Airlines inaugu rated the only single-plane jumbo jet  service from the Middle West to Israel.  It was my pleasure to work with Civil  Aeronautics  Board  Chairman Dan  McKinnon to ensure the economic suc cess of this service by allowing the El  Al flight to continue on to Los Angeles  to pick up west coast passengers bound  for Israel.  Five years ago, I broke a bottle of  champagne  across  the  nose  of  an  American-made El Al 747 when it en tered the Chicago market for the first  time. However, because of the reces sion, the service was terminated.  Service to Chicago had been possible  under the terms of a bilateral aviation  agreement we  signed with  Israel  in  1978, in which I urged the inclusion of  Chicago as a landing point.  I wish great success to El Al Israel  Airlines. It is an airline with an entire  fleet of aircraft built  in the United  States.  Now that El Al serves the three larg est cities in the United States, more  Americans will be able to discover the  historical and  religious  treasures of  the State of Israel.  I ask unanimous consent that an ex cellent article by Timothy J. McNulty  of the Chicago Tribune be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  NEW CHICAGO-TO-TEL AVIV LINK SIGN OF  ISRAELI AIRLINE RECOVERY  <By Timothy J. McNulty)  JERUSALEM.-El Al,  the  Israeli  airline,  begins a direct  link between Chicago and  Tel Aviv Monday, a sign the troubled na tional carrier is recovering from its econom ic, political and religious setbacks.  The new route  is part of an aggressive  campaign to stem past losses and improve a  poor image brought about by frequent wild cat strikes [69 in 10 years] and abominable  service-there are  those who say the air line's  initials  stand  for  ""Every Landing  Always Late.""  The once-a-week Boeing 747  flight from  O'Hare [on Monday night] isn't the first at tempt by El Al to enter the Midwest market.  A similar one was made five years ago but  failed after several months.  El Al, a symbol of Israeli nationhood and  an important factor in the country's econo my, is back with a stronger hand now. After  a  crippling  four-month shutdown  in  late  1982, it declared bankruptcy and went into  receivership. The company revived with gov ernment  aid  and began  trimming  staff.  From 6,300 employees in 1979 it has been  cut to 3,600 today.  As part of the restructuring that began in  1983, new management was installed, fuel guzzling aircraft were grounded, and un profitable lines and offices were closed. An  extensive  retraining  program,  new  food  menus [all kosher] and four new, fuel-effi cient Boeing 767 planes are aimed at at tracting more passengers.  There still are operational problems  to  overcome: Under  Israeli coalition politics,  the nation's small but powerful  religious  parties forced  the government  to ground  the airline from Friday evening to Saturday  evening to comply with the Jewish sabbath.  That loss of business alone is estimated to  cost $30 million a year.  Many  of  the  airline's  labor  problems  appear to have been quieted by breaking the  independence and accumulated power of its  eight unions during the four-month shut down.  The poor service reputation still haunts  the airline, which in 1979 was ranked by one  guidebook as last among all airlines flying  to Britain, even behind Iran Air, a carrier  that under Islamic law won't serve alcoholic  drinks to its passengers.  El Al, however, has added perks  to  its  flights, offering free headsets, free liquor in  all classes, movies on even short flights to  and from Europe and, beginning last week, a  synopsis of Israeli news programs in both  Hebrew and English.  ""We've gone from a 70 percent negative to  a 70 percent positive response in customer  comments,""  said Nachman Kleiman,  a  former Chicagoan who is El Al's spokesman  here.  An incentive for the new Chicago route is  a free stopover in Amsterdam, from where  the traveler can make his own way to any of  the 21 other cities in Europe served by El  Al, and then board another flight for Israel.  The Chicago flight will go on to Los Ange les on Sunday and then return Monday to  pick up  its Chicago passengers bound for  Israel. The addition of  those  two  cities  brings  to  five  the number of U.S. cities  served by El AI. There are daily Tel Aviv New York flights and also flights to Boston  and Miami via Montreal.  Along with Israeli Ministry of Tourism. El  Al is trying to promote more Christian pil . grimages to the Holy Land. It hopes to tap  new markets both in the U.S. and Far East,  especially Korea and Japan.  Another marketing program is aimed at  America's large Jewish population. Only 8  percent of U.S. Jews have visited Israel, ac cording  to  Israeli  estimates,  ""an  absurd  figure,"" Klieman said.  Though El AI has become operationally  profitable in the last year, it is still paying  off debt and shows a loss. Company execu tives predict a continued loss of $15 million  to $20 million this year from interest pay ments on outstanding debts, but they hope  to show a profit in the next fiscal year.  El AI was founded in 1948. It operates a  fleet of 20  aircraft and serves 26  cities,  maintaining  offices  in  an  additional  26  cities.  SOVIET ""ACTIVE MEASURES""  ",1984
723,10,14,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, the dis tinguished Chicago council on foreign  relations  recently held a  significant  discussion  on Soviet  disinformation  practices worldwide. The council was  addressed by William E. Knepper of  the State Department's Bureau for In telligence and Research who described  the  extensive Soviet disinformation  program  and provided  examples  of  Soviet forgeries designed to serve as  ""evidence""  for Soviet  foreign policy  propaganda themes. Feeling that this  analysis will be of interest to my col leagues, I ask unanimous consent that  excerpts from Mr. Knepper's remarks  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the ex cerpts were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  THE CHICAGO COUNCIL ON FOREIGN  RELATIONS-""SOVIET ACTIVE MEASURES""  <Speech by William E. Knepper>  ""Active Measures"" means unorthodox and  covert Soviet and Bloc efforts to affect po litical attitudes and influence public opinion  in the non-communist world.  Our Embassies abroad have as a priority  requirement reporting likely forgeries that  may appear in the press or be circulated pri vately among influential foreign leaders and  opinion makers.

724,23,14,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr. President, the  national  minimum  drinking  age  amendment is designed to encourage  States  to outlaw  the  ""purchase or  public possession""  of  any  alcoholic  beverage by a person who is less than  21 years of age. I want to make it clear  that this is not an attempt to require  any State to set minimum age limits  for  restaurant or  tavern  employees  who  take alcoholic beverage orders,  check identification, or mix, serve, or  receive payment for alcoholic drinks.  The term ""public possession,"" in other  words, does not pertain to such em ployees who  are handling alcoholic  beverages in the course of their jobs.  Mr. President, may I inquire, is this  also  the intention of the sponsor of  the amendment, Senator LAUTENBERG?  ",1984
725,23,14,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Yes, Mr. Presi dent, that is absolutely correct. It is  not the intention of the sponsor or the  cosponsors of the minimum drinking  age  amendment  to  influence  the  States in any way on the issue of a  minimum  age  for  employees  of  li censed alcoholic beverage retailers.  Congress recognizes that the restau rant industry alone provides  jobs  to  hundreds of thousands, perhaps over a  million young people under the age of  21.  It is one of the best sources of  entry-level  employment  for women  and minorities, as well.  I want to join the Senator from Mis souri in assuring my colleagues that  the minimum age  amendment does  nothing  to  jeopardize  the  jobs  of  young people who mix, serve, sell, or  otherwise handle alcoholic beverages  in  the course of  their employment  with licensed retailers.

726,23,14,Mr. DANFORTH., I thank the Sena tor.  e ,1984
727,23,14,Mr.  BAUCUS.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to direct a question to the  manager of the amendment, Senator  LAUTENBERG. In the State of Montana,  it takes not only a statutory amend ment, but also a constitutional amend ment to raise the legal drinking age.  Therefore, in Montana, the State leg islature would have to meet, approve a  constitutional amendment, and  then  put it on the ballot. The statutes deal ing with the drinking age would also  have to be changed by referendum or  legislative action. This entire process  could take a considerable amount of  time and cannot realistically be accom plished before the deadline of October  1, 1986, that is set in your amendment.  Under your amendment,  it would  appear that Montana would be penal ized,  not  because  it  chose not  to  comply with this law, but simply be cause  it would  not  have  time  to  comply, whether it wanted to or not.  Could the Senator address this ques tion?  e ",1984
728,23,14,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," As the Senator  is aware, the Department of Transpor tation  is  always most  reluctant  to  impose sanctions upon States when ever it can be reasonably avoided. If in  fact, by fiscal year 1987,  the process  ",1984

731,49,14,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  in strong support of the amendment  offered by my  friend and colleague  [Mr.  LAUTENBERG] which encourages  States to raise their drinking age to 21.  I want  to commend my  fellow  col league from New Jersey for his un yielding efforts to get this bill enacted;  if it were not for his commitment, diliIt  gence, and persistence, we would not  today be debating this vital piece of  legislation which is aimed at reducing  the number of deaths on our highways  due to drunk driving.  Mr. President,  this bill provides a  strong incentive to raise the drinking  age to 21-Federal funds would be re duced if States are out of compliance.  The bill generally employs the same  mechanism as is used to establish the  55-mile-per-hour speed limit. It grants  States a 2-year grace period in which  to raise  their minimum age  for  the  purchase and public possession of alco holic beverages  to 21. Those States  which have not raised their minimum  drinking age by 1987 would have 5 per cent  of  their  Federal-aid  highway  funds withheld under primary, second ary, interstate, and urban construction  programs. If, by 1988, a State has not  yet acted to raise its drinking age to  21, then 10 percent .of Federal funding  would be withheld. If the State took  action at a  later date  to  raise  the  drinking age, then the State would be  reimbursed for the Federal funds that  were withheld.  The greatly well publicized strong  correlation between  teenage alcohol  use and high incidence of traffic acci dents clearly justifies this action. The  death statistics are alarming:  Drunk driving is the single leading  cause of death among 15to 24-year olds. Presently, 14  teenagers will die  each day in drunk driving accidents. In  1980,  nearly  9,000  teenagers were  killed in motor vehicle accidents.  For every 330 children born today in  the United States-which is about the  size of a small grade school-1 will die  and 4 will sustain serious or crippling  injuries  in an alcohol-related  crash  before they reach the age of 24.  In New  Jersey, one of  the most  densely  populated  States  in  the  Nation, nearly 80 youths under  the  age of 21 died in alcohol-related traffic  accidents last year.  Mr. President, the uniform drinking  age is of special concern to the tristate  area  consisting of New York, New  Jersey, and Connecticut. The  lower  drinking age  in New York and Con necticut provides an opportunity for  youths to drive across State borders to  obtain  alcohol-helping  to  create  ""blood corridors"".  New  Jersey has been a  leader  in  dealing with  this problem  through  education programs and through legis lative initiatives to get tough on drunk  driving. In addition, New Jersey raised  the drinking age from 19 to 21 in 1982.  The quick and positive impact has al ready been demonstrated. For exam ple, nighttime fatal accidents  involv ing 19-and 20-year-olds fell 25 percent  in New Jersey last year.  It should be emphasized that this  effort is widely supported. The Drink ing Age Act passed the House of Rep",1984

734,62,14,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, today  I am introducing a private bill for the  relief of Frederick and Aileen Paul of  Seattle, W A. This legislation would re lieve Mr. and Mrs. Paul of all Federal  income tax liability on sums awarded  to Mr. Paul by the Court of Claims in  1975.  Mr. Paul received this award as com pensation for 7 years of legal services  rendered on behalf of  the Alaskan  North Slope Eskimos. Mr. Paul's ef forts were largely responsible for the  passage of the Alaska Native Claims  Settlement Act and the creation of the  North Slope Borough.  Mr. Paul, who is one-fourth Tlingit  Indian, did not include his $275,000 in  legal fees in his gross income for 1975  because of a provision in the Alaska  Native Claims Settlement Act which  states:  Revenues  originating  from  the Alaska  Native Fund shall not be subject  to any  form of Federal       taxation at the time  of  receipt  by  a        individual  Native  through dividend distributions or in any  other manner. 43 U.S.C. 160<a> <emphasis  added).  He was advised by three tax attor neys that this provision would cover  his legal fees. The Internal Revenue  Service and the courts concluded, how ever,  that  his  fees were  not  tax exempt on the basis of the purpose,  context, and legislative history of this  subsection.  Because of this ruling, Mr. and Mrs.  Paul owe more than $200,000 in taxes  and interest on his legal fees.  Mr. Paul, who is legally blind, faces  possible insolvency because of his in valuable efforts on behalf of Alaskan  Natives.  The bill  I  am  introducing  today  would correct this injustice by reliev ing Mr. and Mrs. Paul of this unwar ranted tax liability. I urge the prompt  and  favorable  consideration  o.f  this  measure.e  By Mr. THURMOND (for him self and Mr. HOLLINGS):  S. 2794.

750,114,14,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise this  afternoon to join in the expression of  concern about yesterday's jump in the  prime  interest rate, the fourth such  increase in the last 4 months.  It should now be crystal clear to ev eryone that yesterday's jump in the  prime rate  is a direct result of  the  clash between the credit demand to fi.  nance  the  recovery  and  the  credit  demand to finance the soaring Federal  budget deficit. It is absolutely impera tive  that we  take steps now to halt  this  competition  for  credit  before  rising interest rates halt the recovery.  The best way to dampen demand for  credit is to reduce these massive Fed eral deficits that are putting upward  pressure on  the  interest  rates. The  failure  to  reduce  these deficits and  hold down interest rates will have par ticularly severe impact on the interest sensitive sectors of our economy.  will become even more difficult  for  young  families  to buy  their homes.  Many Americans will be simply unable  to afford the financing costs to buy a  new car.  It is time to stop talking about inter est rates and actually do something  about them. It is  time to get serious  about reducing the huge Federal defi cits.  It  BIGOTRY HAS NO PLACE IN  AMERICA  <Mr. LEVINE of California  asked  and was given permission to address  the House for 1 minute and to revise  and extend his remarks.)  ",1984
751,114,14,Mr.  LEVINE  of  California.," Mr.  Speaker, bigotry should have no place  in America. Yet the purveyors of hate  do not let up.  Louis Farrakhan yesterday  labeled  Israel's existence an ""outlaw act,"" he  labeled America and England ""crimi nal"" states, and he labeled Judaism a  ""gutter religion.""  Mr. Speaker, it is important to un derstand that these are not examples  of a black-Jewish rift. These are the  statements of an individual bigot.  Both blacks and Jews have long his tories  experiencing  suffering,  preju dice,  and bigotry and have worked  closely with each other and will con-  tinue to do so, fighting against preju dice and for civil rights.  Let us remember that Mr. Farrak han has a following of no more than  5,000  to 10,000 people  in  the entire  Nation; 95 percent of all black Ameri cans who are Muslims have chosen not  to follow his direction.  Especially for those of us whose po litical vision was shaped by the civil  rights movement and the inspiration  of prophets such as Martin Luther  King, Jr., let us remember that Mr.  Farrakhan's ugly and misguided com ments have been rejected both by the  minority community and the general  community, and that is as it should be.  D 1240  REAGAN  POLICIES  SEEN  AS  DEEPENING  UNITED  STATES  MILITARY  INVOLVEMENT  IN  CENTRAL AMERICA  <Mr. ALEXANDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute, and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1984
752,114,14,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday I released the findings of a 6month investigation conducted by the  General Accounting  Office,  which  report spells out the extent to which  Mr. Reagan has used his recent ""train ing"" exercises in Honduras as an ille gal cover for the deepening American  military involvement in Central Amer ica.  Secretary Weinberger responded to  that report by stating that the GAO  findings were ""bookkeeping errors.""  Mr.  Speaker,  the  decision  states  clearly that a majority of the military  construction undertaken during  the  ""training exercises,"" all training pro vided to Honduran troops by United  States military, and all civic and hu manitarian  actions  conducted  by  United States military personnel vio lates American law.  The Secretary of Defense, though, is  partially correct. The GAO investiga tion does point to serious errors, but  they are not bookkeeping errors.  Mr. Speaker, they are errors in the  President's policy in Central America,  a policy which is leading this Nation  into a deepening, widening military in volvement which  the President  of  Mexico says could lead us into a re gional war.  RECONCILIATION UPDATE  <Mr. PANETTA asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks  and  include  extraneous  matter.>  ",1984
753,114,14,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Speaker,  the  reconciliation conference wrapped up  work on over 60 billion dollars' worth  of deficit reduction legislation late last  week, with the subconference on taxes  finishing early Saturday morning. The  House owes a great debt of gratitude  to the committee chairman and con ferees who participated in the 12 sub conferences and struggled with some  very tough issues. Special recognition  should go  to  the Ways and Means  Committee, which, under the leader ship of Chairman ROSTENKOWSKI, pro duced over 90 percent of the deficit re ductions contained in the conference  report.  A vote is expected this week on the  reconciliation conference report .. This  will be one of  the most  important  votes of the year in terms of enforcing  the budget resolution we adopted last  April, and it will be the best opportu nity of the year to vote for large defi  cit  reductions. With  the prime  rate  climbing to 13 percent yesterday it is  clear that the country needs a signal  that the Congress is serious about re ducing  the  deficit. Consequently  I  hope we see strong support not only  for the conference report on reconcili ation, but for a reduction in defense  spending as part of the budget resolu tion conference. These efforts must go  hand in hand-revenue increases and  entitlement reductions must be accom panied by restraint in defense spend ing.  Members should be aware  that  if  you  add  the  spending  reductions  achieved in the reconciliation confer ence  report  to  legislation  reducing  spending enacted earlier, the total 3year spending reductions for reconcili ation amount  to almost $19 billion.  That compares to the $12.3 billion we  targeted  for  reconciliation  in  the  House-passed resolution.  While we do not yet have the official  estimates on the tax provisions in the  bill, the Ways and Means and Senate  Finance Committees have estimated  that the total is about $50 billion over  4 years. On the spending side, CBO  has analyzed the provisions of the rec onciliation conference report and sub mitted  the numbers shown below.  I  have also described some of the high lights of each  subconference agree ment.  3-YEAR OUTLAY TOTALS  [In billions of dollars]  Finance, Budget... ........................ .  in  I.

754,127,14,Mr. THOMAS  of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, many people believe  that  the most  fundamental  right  which we possess in a democracy, the  right  to choose our  leaders by  free  election, is being unduly influenced by  the broadcast news media and  the  poll takers.  The Committee on House Adminis tration Task Force on Elections is of fering House Concurrent Resolution  321 out of concern that early projec tions of election results by broadcast  networks have an impact on the out come of the elections themselves. The  committee  is also greatly concerned  about the impact which early election  projections have on individual voters  across the Nation. We know from field  hearings  on  this  issue  that many  angry and disillusioned voters did not  cast ballots  in the 1980 Presidential  election after learning that the winner  had already been proclaimed on na tionwide  television and radio. As my  colleague indicated earlier, some State  elections and a congressional race may  very well have hinged on voter apathy  created by the early prediction of vic tory by the news media.  The prevailing attitude described by  witnesses at the hearings was, ""Why  should we vote when our vote doesn't  count? Why bother if it's all over as  soon as TV decides who's going  to  win?""  The testimony received by the com mittee reveals that Americans hold in  deep respect their right to vote, and  they are rightly upset when the im portance and meaning of each individ ual's vote is robbed by reports of what  may happen as  though  it had hap pened. Resentment and apathy  trig gered in the 1980 election could spread  with the increasing use of sophisticat ed polling techniques and early elec tion  projections  by  the  broadcast  media. Unless we act to balance the  public's right to know against the in tegrity of the polling place, the Ameri can public may decide it would be just  as well to sit out future elections, and  our democracy will be seriously threat ened.  I know that observers of this debate  might hastily conclude  that  this  only a west coast problem, but that is  certainly not the case. Although the  impact of early projections is greatest  in the West, as my colleague has de scribed, we should remember that the  projection of  the 1980 Presidential  race came while the polls were open in  about half the States in the nation. In  1981, the Governor's race was project ed in New Jersey while polls were still  open. In 1982, a number of State races  were projected before the polls closed.  is  In this Presidential election year, we  have already witnessed a number of  network projections  in primary elec tions around the country. On March  13, Super Tuesday,  the  three major  networks projected results in Florida,  Alabama, and Massachusetts 1 hour  before  the  polls  closed.  In Rhode  Island,  the call was made 2 hours  before  the polls closed.  In the New  York primary on April 3, the networks  began projecting results at 6:30 p.m.,  2% hours before the polls closed at 9  p.m. In Pennsylvania, network projec tions came 1 hour before  the polls  closed. And in the Iowa caucuses held  February 20, NBC and CBS were pro jecting winners before the voting had  even started.  The committee has  received more  than 1,000  letters from voters  in 49  States expressing disappointment and  bitterness over projections of election  results being made before  the polls  close. Opposition  to  this practice  is  also beginning to be heard from broad cast  industry  members.  Richard  Salant, the former president of CBS  News who pioneered in developing pro jections based on tabulating selected  voter precincts, now says he doesn't  trust  these  early  projections. The  president of Group W Television, Law rence P. Fraiberg, told his colleagues  recently that he is deeply concerned  with the effect which TV coverage specifically, exit polls and projections  based on those polls-is having on the  national political process. The admin istration, in reply to a House subcom mittee  inquiry on  its position, has  stated its opposition to projection of  Federal  election  results  because  of  their adverse effect on voter turnout.  Prior to the New York Presidential  primary election last April,  I  joined  my  colleagues  on  the House Task  Force on Elections and the House Sub committee on Telecommunications in  requesting the broadcast networks to  refrain  voluntarily  from  projecting  election results before the polls closed.  One of the networks replied that its  practice  is not to project winners of  primary elections until after the polls  are closed, and that it would adhere to  that practice through the rest of the  primary elections and in the Novem ber general election.  The networks  have  responded  to  growing public concern over their in fluence on elections by changing their  projections to characterizations -of re sults, but  the characterizations con tain at least as much, if not more, in formation than the projections. The  network  reporters make  comments  such as: ""indications are"" that a candi date will win a ""decisive victory"" or  that a candidate is ""doing very well""  and ""may win by as wide a margin as  he did in New York.""  Such characterizations, while stop ping  short  of  outright  prediction,  ",1984
755,179,14,Ms. FERRARO.," Mr. Chairman,  I  want  to  thank  the gentleman  from  New York  [Mr. WEiss]  for his very  concise and clear statement. He makes  the point that New York  is making  every effort to comply with the laws.  As a matter of fact. we are 6 months  ahead of time. We have six construc tion crews working. The only place we  could put another construction crew is  if we put them on a barge out in the  water. There is  the intent to finish,  there is the desire to finish, and this  language is merely a punitive effort di rected at New York City.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues  to support the amendment.  ",1984
756,179,14,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  I will not use all of my 5 minutes. I  just want to add to the words of my  distinguished colleague, the gentleman  from New York [Mr. WEISS], and say  that New York is going now above and  beyond the call of duty.  We are functioning under a consent  decree. We are ahead of the schedule  outlined in the consent decree. When  the two plants under construction are  finished, one in May 1986 and one in  May 1987. we will be in compliance.  There  are  242  cities  around  the  country that are substantially situated  as New York City is. They are not in  compliance with all of the EPA re quirements, but they, as we are, work ing on  it. For some obscure  reason  that I do not understand, New York  City was the only city that was select ed for this rather invidious treatment.  I know it was not meant to be invidi ous treatment, but on the face of it. it  is, and I would urge my colleagues, the  gentlemen  from New  Jersey  [Mr.  HowARD and Mr. RoE], who have been  friends  and colleagues of mine  for  many, many  years,  to  accept  the  amendment offered by  the gracious  gentlewoman from New York. I think  it would be the collegial thing to do.  New York is aimed right at compli ance in a matter of months. They are  headed toward compliance, and they  are  in  compliance with  the  court  order.  Mr. Chairman, I would urge that we  have collegial and friendly action from  our friends across the Hudson.  Mr. McGRATH. Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of  the amendment offered by the gentle woman from New York [Ms. FERRARO].  ",1984
757,179,14,Mr. HOWARD.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words, and I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman. this is a very impor tant amendment.  Members might ask, why is the Con gress about to pick on New York City?  There is no large city in this Nation  other  than New York City which  dumps any raw sewage into the waters  to be sent down somewhere else.  I  wonder if the 240 cities that are men tioned that have some raw sewage add  up  to  this amount all put together.  New York City dumps and have been  dumping 220 million gallons of raw  sewage a day into the Hudson River.  That  is  220 million gallons  a  day.  enough to fill a football field at the  Meadowlands arena to a height of 67  stories high, two-thirds the height of  the huge complex buildings at the foot  of New York. That is 12 square miles  to a depth 1 inch thick each day.  At this rate,  if New York City did  not want to treat but just kept its raw  sewage, it would cover the entire city,  all five boroughs, in 1 month. But that  does not happen. It is dumped into the  waters of the Hudson River. It flows  down on the seashore areas, and for so  many years people who  live  in New  Jersey and the New Jersey seashore  that depend upon clean beaches and  clean water have said that we must  accept this from New York City be cause New York City  is so big and  powerful and rich and important that  the other communities  just have  to  take second place.  I  think the time has come  to  just  assure that New York City meets its  commitments. What we did in this leg islation is this: We did not stop con struction. We will not stop construc tion if New York City means what it  says. It sets a date of March 15, 1986.  We had an earlier date, but in dis cussions with a member of our com mittee, the gentleman from New York  [Mr. MOLINARI], we set that date back  to March 15, 1986, saying that that  puts a cap and a limit on how much  New York City may discharge into the  river to come down into New Jersey  and Long Island shores.  Now, New York City is working on  its North River plant. Its North River  plant is due to be in operation, treat ing only primary raw sewage, by No vember 1985. Under our amendment,  we figure it on an average per month  basis of  the year.  starting prior  to  March 15, 1986, which gives them 7%  months of heavy discharge of  raw  sewage 4% months after  the plant  opens. When that plant opens, it will  treat 150 million gallons a day. So  they do not have that much leeway to  work on.  What about the fact of what would  take place  if something happens? If  there is a strike that delays the con struction of that plant,  if there are  heavy overflows due to rain. if light ning strikes the plant and there is a  delay, in the substitute amendment of fered by  the gentleman  from New  Jersey [Mr. RoE] and myself there is a  provision that grants the head of EPA  the right to extend the time limit for  compliance.  So  if New York City  means what  it says,  it will have no  trouble at all.  New York City says that as far as  dumping  raw  sewage,  they  are  6  months  ahead.  If we  look  at  the  papers. they are 49 years behind. We  have  been  complaining  about  this  since 1935, and it is about time consid eration is given to those downstream.  New York City dumps this raw sewage  and they do not have to worry; it im mediately leaves their area, and they  get clean water from communities up stream that are taking of their sewage.  Nobody  is picking on New York. I  love New York. The Committee on  Public Works  and  Transportation  loves New York. There is no commit tee in this Congress that has been a  better friend of New York City down  through the years than our commit tee.  They have a problem with Newtown  Creek  in Brooklyn  that would cost  New York City $250 million to get into  secondary  treatment at  the proper  time. What did our committee do? We  wanted  to help  them. We put that  project on a demonstration basis, and  instead of having the Federal Govern ment only pay 55 percent, we grandfa thered in the old 75 percent. We do  not hear very much thanks from New  York City on that effort that is being  made this week in this Congress.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  time  of  the  gentleman  from New  Jersey [Mr. HowARD] has expired.  <By unanimous consent. Mr. HowARD  was allowed to proceed for 2 additional  minutes.)  ",1984
758,179,14,Mr. HOWARD.," Mr. Chairman, I do  not know why New York City is oppos ing  this amendment. It merely says  that we want to make sure that they  do what they say they are going to do.  We give all kinds of provisions for New  York City to be in compliance should  something happen that is not its fault.  The only reason they might oppose  this would be if they do not want to  keep their commitment, if they intend  to go back to the courts again, as they  have done  so often and gotten  so  many extensions and so much relief  because they are so big and powerful  and rich and important. more so than  the rest of the country. I do not know  why they oppose it.  The largest contractor in New York  City called me a couple of weeks ago,  ",1984
759,192,14,Mr. RAHALL.," I would say to the dis tinguished Chairman of the Interior  Committee, no, they would not be.  ",1984
760,192,14,Mr. UDALL.,"  I am concerned  that  some operators may draw their permit  areas  to avoid preexisting acid dis charges during a remining operation.  Such a practice would leave unmined  coal reserves. As the gentleman knows,  section  515(b)(l)  of  the  Surface  Mining Control and Reclamation Act  of 1977 requires that a coal operator  maximize coal  recovery  so  that  the  land would not have to be reaffected  in the future. Do you agree that this  requirement would be applicable to sit uations  addressed  by  your  amend ment?  ",1984
761,192,14,Mr. RAHALL.,"  I  am  in  complete  agreement with  the  gentleman.  I  would say once again that in no way  does this amendment affect provisions  of  the Surface Mining Control and  Reclamation Act of 1977 or the regula tions to implement that act.  And  as  the  gentleman  knows,  I  served with him on  the conference  committee that enacted that law, and  this is in no way an attempt to circum ventthat1977law.  ",1984
762,192,14,Mr. UDALL.," I thank the gentleman,  and I ask, finally,  if the amendment  affects a State's authority to set and  apply water quality standards?  ",1984
763,192,14,Mr. RAHALL., The amendment does  not amend any section of the Federal  Water Pollution Control Act nor does  it deal with that authority.  ,1984
764,192,14,Mr. UDALL.," I thank the gentleman,  and I congratulate him on a fine job.  ",1984
765,192,14,Mr. RAHALL.," I thank the chairman  for his remarks and for his concerns  with respect to how this provision re lates  to the Surface Mining Control  and Reclamation Act of 1977, a matter  that is completely within the jurisdic tion of his committee. The gentleman  from Arizona has long held a great in terest in the surface coal mining in dustry and recognizes the need for the  incentive  to  remine abandoned coal  mine  lands provided by  this  legislation.  I would like to once again express  my appreciation to the distinguished  chairman of the full committee, the  gentleman  from New  Jersey  [Mr.  HowARD],  and  the  ranking minority  member,  the gentleman  from Ken tucky [Mr. SNYDER], for their valiant  efforts  in  regard  to  this  legislation  also.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr.  CLINGER].  ",1984
766,192,14,Mr. CLINGER.," I  thank the gentle man for yielding, and I would just like  to commend him for his work in this  very important area, and I am pleased  -r  to have been able to join with you in  working on this amendment.  In my State of Pennsylvania,  the  regulatory  authority  estimates  that  $75 million  in  reclamation per year  will be done by the private sector as a  result of this amendment.  So it is my understanding that under  this provision programs such as  the  one proposed by Pennsylvania's Gen eral  Assembly-which,  incidentally,  has  the  support  of both  the  coal  mining industry and the environmen tal community-would be an accepta ble program. Is that the understand ing of the gentleman from West Vir ginia?  ",1984
767,192,14,Mr. RAHALL., Yes; that is my under standing.  ,1984
768,192,14,Mr. CLINGER.," I  thank the gentle man very much  for yielding, and  I  again commend him for his work on  this very vital issue.  ",1984
769,192,14,Mr. RAHALL.,"  I  thank the gentle man for his comments.  Before I conclude, Mr. Chairman, if  I might ask the chairman of the sub committee, Mr. RoE,  to enter into a  colloquy with me in regard to the col lector sewage system in this bill, Mr.  Chairman, as you are well aware, the  1981 amendments to the construction  grants program eliminated from grant  eligibility  problems  associated with  combined  sewer  overflows,  replace ment,  and  rehabilitation,  and  con struction,  and  repair  of  collector  sewers. This was tempered by a provi sion which allowed grants to be made  for these otherwise ineligible catego ries in an amount not to exceed 20 per cent of a State's allotment as deter mined by the Governor.  The committee amendment  in  the  nature of a substitute would reinstate  grant eligibility for collector sewer sys tems. However, while  the bill as  re ported by the committee would also  reinstate collector sewers,  the substi tute would delete the provision of this  bill.  I would ask the distinguished sub committee chairman, does the action  of the committee have any reflection  on the importance of collector sewer  systems and especially to rural parts  of our Nation?  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  time of the gentleman from West Vir ginia [Mr. RAHALL] has expired.  (By unanimous consent, Mr. RAHALL  was allowed to proceed for 2 additional  minutes.)  ",1984
770,192,14,Mr. ROE.,"  If the  gentleman will  yield, no, we do not believe it does, be cause when we revisitJd that issue we  had  taken both  the collector sewer  and the combined sewer elements out  of  the Governors' discretionary sec tion and put it into a separate section.  When we put it back again, in effect  what we are saying now  is  there  is  more funding that would be available  in the 20-percent discretionary section  of  the Governors  than  there would  have been before, and also, of course,  we have requested, as the gentleman  knows, as a distinguished member of  the  committee,  an  increase  in  the  funding to be allocated for this pro gram. So all in all we figure we have at  least  provided  a  quantum  step  in  making  collector  sewers-which  I  happen to agree with, by the wayeli gible under the legislation. It is not  the  intent of  the committee  in any  way to denigrate that eligibility.  ",1984
771,192,14,Mr. RAHALL.," I thank the chairman.  Since collector systems remain as the  only  category besides  rehabilitation  eliminated  from grant eligibility, as  CSO's as being reinstated by the sub committee, is it the intention of the  committee  that collector systems be  the  primary  recipient  of  funding  under the 20-percent Governors' set aside?  ",1984
772,192,14,Mr. ROE., The gentleman is correct.  ,1984
773,192,14,Mr. RAHALL.,"  I  thank  the distin guished gentleman.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentle man from New York [Mr. NowAK].  ",1984
774,192,14,Mr. NOWAK.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  I wish  to associate  myself with the remarks of my col league from West Virginia regarding  the importance of funding for the con struction of collector pipeline systems.  I must strongly disagree with those  who assert that the sole effect of col lector  construction  is  to  encourage  ""urban sprawl""  in  rural areas. The  simple  fact  is  this:  effective  wastewater  treatment  facilities  are  systems. Each part of these systems  must operate efficiently if the facili ties are  to properly  treat municipal  and industrial wastewater. The most  efficient and modern wastewater treat ment plant in the world is of little use  if there are not adequate pipelines to  collect the sewage and convey it to the  plant. Collector pipelines contribute to  economic expansion, not urban sprawl.  I  am  sure  that everyone  is  very  much aware of the national attention  that is being focused on America's de caying  infrastructure.  Recognizing  that the aging sewer systems are a  major problem facing our older indus trial cities of  the Northeast,  I have  been concerned that the 1981 amend ments to the Clean Water Act would  restrict Federal assistance for certain  categories of wastewater treatment fa cilities. Under current law, such cate gories  as  combined  sewer  overflow  [CSOJ projects and collector sewers  will not be eligible  for  full  funding  after October 1, 1984. However,  the  law does provide that each Governor  would be able to use 20 percent of his  annual allotment to fund such ineligi ble categories of construction.  I am pleased that the bill before us  today does reinstate CSO projects as  an eligible category for grant assist ance and also provides that collector  ",1984

777,205,14,Mr. EDGAR., I yield to the gentle man from Minnesota.  ,1984
778,205,14,Mr.  STANGELAND.,"  friend for yielding.  Certainly we  on  this  side  have  looked at the amendment, we accept  it. Beyond that, I would like to say I  want to commend the gentleman for  being a catalyst in working to put this  together.  Perhaps one of the strongest envi ronmentalist  advocates here  in  the  Congress, certainly on the Committee  on Public Works and Transportation.  Had it not been for his strong associa tion with these environmental groups,  it might have been more difficult for  the chairman of the subcommittee and  the chairman of the full committee to  bring that to fruition. But because of  that close association, because of the  respect that he has in that community  and on the committee, he has been a  catalyst.  I want to commend his role in this  clean water bill, because it is a clean  water bill. We would be happy  to  accept the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of  the  gentleman  from Pennsylvania's  amendment.  The question of proper sludge treat ment and disposal practices is one of  the most important matters dealt with  by the Clean Water Act. It makes very  little difference that we are removing  pollutants from waste streams in our  cities  if,  in  the process, all we are  doing is transferring the pollution from  our water to the land. The situation  becomes even more critical in light of  the  fact  that,  in many  instances,  sludge  from wastewater  treatment  plants is used as fertilizer, fill for re claiming abandoned mines, and other  nonwaste purposes. Under  these cir cumstances,  it is absolutely essential  that we  ensure  to  the maximum  extent practicable that sewage sludge  does not contain  toxic pollutants  in  concentrations  that may  adversely  affect human health or the environ ment.  The question of proper use and dis posal of sludge is not a new issue. The  Agency has been tasked with provid ing sludge use guidelines since Public  Law 92-500 in 1972. Again, in the 1977  Clean Water Act, Congress focused on  the need to develop adequate proce dures and requirements for disposing  of sewage sludge and amended the act  to require promulgation of guidelines  and necessary  regulations. Unfortu nately, we are still awaiting the prod uct of the work that has been ongoing  at EPA since 1977.  The gentleman's amendment  is  in tended to accomplish this objective. It  is drafted in a way to emphasize once  again how important the Congress be lieves this issue is. It is a good amend ment and I urge its adoption.  ",1984
779,205,14,Mrs. JOHNSON.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1984
780,205,14,Mr. EDGAR., I yield to the gentle woman from Connecticut.  ,1984
781,205,14,Mrs.  JOHNSON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  want to commend the gentleman from  Pennsylvania  on  this  amendment.  Without the work that he is requiring  EPA to do in regard to sludge identifi cation, classification, testing, and cata lyzation, the environmentally commit ted entrepreneurs of America cannot  find ways to reuse this material in a  constructive  environmentally  sound  fashion.  I have in my own district a creative  young man who has, through the way  he manages his plant, demonstrated  the soundness of his concern for the  environment and his willingness  to  invest in environmentally sound meth ods, who has discovered a way to bond  sludge together.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The  time of the gentleman from Georgia  has expired.  <By unanimous consent, Mr. EDGAR  was allowed to proceed for 1 additional  minute.)  ",1984
782,205,14,Mr. EDGAR., I yield to the gentle woman from Connecticut.  ,1984
783,205,14,Mrs. JOHNSON., It is a very promis ing process. It will have commercial  application. It will be a building mate rial. But there simply is no framework  within which this material can be eval uated publicly. And I appreciate the  gentleman's leadership in this area.  ,1984
784,205,14,Mr. EDGAR.,"  I  thank  the gentle woman.  Let me conclude by saying that I  love sludge and I love the fact that the  Members have accepted  the amend ment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal ance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN. The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentle man from Pennsylvania [Mr. EDGAR]  to the amendment in the nature of a  substitute  offered  by Mr. RoE,  as  amended.

I  wanted to take an opportunity to con gratulate  Chairman  HoWARD  and  Chairman RoE for their leadership on  this very important bill.  I  think  the key point about  this  piece of legislation is that it is a forged  compromise that is truly a strong envi ronmentally-supported bill. I urge all  my collegues to support this piece of  legislation.  ",1984
786,205,14,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words, and I rise in support of the sub stitute.  Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  to commend  the diligent efforts of Representative  HOWARD,  chairman  of  the  Public  Works and Transportation Committee,  Representative RoE, chairman of the  Subcommittee on Water Resources,  and the ranking Republican members  of  the  committee  for  successfully  bringing H.R. 3282, a 4-year reauthor ization of the Clean Water Act, before  the House today. Today's actions cul minate work that began late  in the  97th Congress to reauthorize the con struction grants program and review  many of the important provisions es tablished in the 1972 Clean Water Act.  As the cornerstone of water pollu tion control, the Clean Water Act sym bolizes  the progress we  have made  toward maintaining and improving the  water quality of rivers, lakes, and estu aries across the Nation. H.R. 3282 is a  remarkable  product  of  consensus  among the often conflicting interests  of  environmental  and  industrial  groups and provides continued hope  for a complete cleanup of the Nation's  waterways.  The objections raised to H.R. 3282  have been addressed by the committee  with the resulting compromise repre senting a marked improvement in our  clean water program. The most impor tant of these improvements is a strong  reauthorization  of  the  construction  grants  program which will  provide  adequate Federal funding to continue  the  construction  of  needed waste  water treatment facilities. Also includ ed are rational and enforceable com pliance deadlines that will allow the  EPA to proceed on schedule with its  industrial and toxic waste programs.  Several provisions in H.R. 3282 are  particularly important to the inhabit ants of the Northeast which has water  pollution problems that are unique to  this region of the country.  Combined  sewer  overflows  are  a  problem  for  the older cities of  the  Northeast that date back to the late  1800's. When  these cities were con structed there was no reason to sepa rate stormwater runoff from sewage  disposal and a combined sewer system  ",1984

790,231,14,Mr. NIELSON of Utah.," Mr. Chair man,  I  apologize  to  the gentleman  from Illinois for not having provided  him this amendment in advance.  Mr. Chairman, what  this  amend ment does is what I suggested in a pre vious statement. It is basically to in corporate  the Schneider  bill, H.R.  5011, which changes the words from  program or activity to institution. This  proposal supports institutionwide cov erage under Federal Government civil  rights statutes, but does so without  the ambiguities of H.R. 5490.  This proposal is fully congruent with  the expressed intent of the sponsors of  H.R. 5490. The proposed statutory lan guage  makes  three  substantive  changes to H.R. 5490.  First, in lieu of the bill's vague and  expansive definition of  recipient,  it  substitutes the existing Federal regu latory definition of ""recipient"" found  in the Department of Justice's regula tion coordinating  implementation of  section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  of 1973, 28 CFR 41.3(d). This regula tory definition has been used as the  basis for  the definition of  the term  ""recipient"" in over 20 Federal regula tions  implementing  section 504  and  closely  approximates  the  definition  used  in  the  regulations of Federal  agencies implementing title VI of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964. It has the dis tinct advantage of being well known  by Federal agencies enforcing the civil  rights statutes, as well as the recipi ents of Federal funds themselves.  This definition  rectifies  the prob lems created by the ambiguous defini tion of recipient in H.R. 5490. First, it  makes it clear that the ultimate bene ficiaries of Federal funds-the BEOG  student, the farmer who receives crop  subsidies, the medicaid patient, the re",1984

The point made by the gentleman  from Wisconsin  is  absolutely valid.  Second, what we are trying to do in  this bill is go back to the pre-Grove  City situation; no more, no less.  We are not  interested  in amend ments on abortions, MX missiles, or  food stamps. We are simply trying to  put the teeth back into the civil rights  laws of this Nation.

I had  been assured earlier that the prolife  sector in our society was not in favor  of an amendment. This stemmed from  the fact  that  the negotiations were  carried on by the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on  the Judiciary  that should be standing where I am  today, our COlleague JIM SENSENBREN NER. And after negotiating with  the  prolife and prochoice forces, language  was agreed to by both which appears  on page 36 in the committee report to  make it absolutely clear that this bill  is neutral on this issue.  The language states:  This bill is not intended to convey either  the approval or disapproval of Congress  concerning the validity or appropriateness  of regulations issued under title IX concern ing health care  insurance and/or services  for employees and students with regard to  abortion.  We sincerely thought that this issue  had been put to rest. Our colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  thought so, too. It was not overnight  that he achieved this negotiated set tlement that apparently was agreed to  by both sides.  So,  I  submit  that  this  is not an  amendment brought  to us with  the  agreement of the prolife forces.  ",1984
801,244,14,Mr. WILLIAMS of Montana.," Mr.  Chairman, I move to strike the requi site number of words. I rise in opposi tion to the amendment.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If my in formation  is  correct,  the  term  ""person"" appears four times in this act  and each time it appears, it refers to a  person receiving or distributing Feder al funds.  Now,  if  I  understand  the gentle man's amendment,  he  is  including  children at the moment of conception  as those receiving or distributing Fed eral funds. What is the purpose of the  amendment? The amendment is moot.  Unborn children do not receive or dis tribute Federal  funds. The  amend ment has no meaning.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. SMITH  of New  Jersey. Mr.  Chairman, I move to strike the requi site number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of the Siljander amendment and I  would like to commend my friend from  Michigan for his courage and compas sion in offering this important amend ment.  I know, Mr. Chairman, that many  Members of  this body are growing  weary of abortion floor fights. But I  would suggest that what we do here  today may indeed result in some now  nameless,  voiceless  child-perhaps  many children-being given a chance  to live.  That, in and of itself, makes any in convenience wholly worthwhile.  I know the prochoice lobby here on  the Hill gets mightly uncomfortable  when faced with the horror of abor tion, or with  the humanity of  the  child in the womb, or with the increas ingly apparent fact that abortion ex ploits  women.  But  reality  isn't  changed or altered one  iota because  someone wishes it away or refuses to  face it. I am reminded of an editorial  that appeared in the Journal of the  California State Medical Association  in September 1970  that  eloquently  summed up this wishful thinking proc ess:  The reverence of each and every human  life has been a keystone of western medi cine, and is the ethic which has caused phy sicians  to  try  to preserve, protect, repair,  prolong, and enhance every human life.  Since the old ethic has not yet been fully  displaced, it has been necessary to separate  the idea of abortion from the idea of killing  which continues  to be socially abhorrent.  The result has been a curious avoidance of  the scientific  fact, which everyone  really  knows,  that human life begins at concep tion, and is continuous, whether intraor  extra-uterine, until death. The very consid erable semantic gymnastics which are  re quired to rationalize abortion as anything  but taking a human life would be ludicrous  if they were not often put forth under so cially  impeccable auspices. It is suggested  that this schizophrenic sort of subterfuge is  necessary because, while  a new ethic  is  being accepted, the old one has not yet been  rejected.  Mr. Chairman, there is no question  that the unborn child is human and  alive, and is the victim of pernicious  ",1984
802,257,14,Mr.  FIELDS.," Mr.  Speaker, H.R.  5490, the Civil Rights Act of 1984 may  prove to be the most far-reaching ex pansion of Federal authority in this  decade. This  legislation has a most  worthy goal-to ensure that no Feder al funds are expended in a discrimina tory manner. I join the supporters of  H.R. 5490  in strongly opposing dis crimination. I find discrimination both  morally and ethically repugnant. How ever, I  feel compelled to oppose the  Civil Rights Act of 1984. The following  explanation is a clarification of my po sition.  H.R. 5490 seeks to overturn a recent  Supreme Court decision, Grove City  College against Bell. Grove City Col lege, a private, coed liberal arts school,  refused to file a Government compli ance form for title IX of the education  amendments, which prohibits discrimi nation on the basis of sex, claiming  that they receive no direct Federal aid  and, hence, are not required to prove  compliance. Grove City College was  never charged with discrimination, but  only with refusal to submit to Federal  regulations  and  their corresponding  administrative  paperwork. The  case  reached the Supreme Court. In ruling,  the Court held that: First, Federal fi nancial assistance to students did con stitute aid to the college, but, second,  only the specific program or activity  receiving Federal assistance would be  required to comply with Federal regu lations under title IX of the education  amendments of 1972.  H.R.  5490 was  introduced  in  the  House  to  overturn  the  Supreme  Court's second holding of limited cov erage. According to the bill's sponsors,  H.R. 5490  reinstates  institution-wide  coverage  of  antidiscrimination  stat utes; if any part of an institution re ceives Federal  assistance,  all  parts  must  comply. While  the  author's  intent may have been simply to return  to the status quo of institution-wide  coverage practiced prior to the Grove  City decision, the actual language of  the bill tells a different story.  H.R. 5490 amends four separate stat utes: The Education Amendments of  1972, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the  Age Discrimination Act of 1975 and  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The  two most fundamental changes made  in the above statutes are: The words  ""program and activity"" are deleted ev erywhere and replaced with the word  ""recipient,""  and,  subsequently,  the  word ""recipient"" is defined.  My concern centers upon the broad,  ambiguous  definition  of  recipient.  Under this bill, recipient means, not  only  the direct  recipient of Federal  aid, but also any subunit of an entity,  any ""successor, assignee, or transferee  to which Federal financial assistance  is extended-directly or  through an other entity or a person-or which re ceives support from the extension of  Federal financial assistance to any of  its subunits."" Think about it! It is dif ficult to isolate any public or private  entity or person which does not  in  some way, directly or indirectly, bene fit from Federal largess. According to  Assistant Attorney General William  Bradford Reynolds, the legislation re writes  the four  involved statutes  to  the point that""*     the Federal Gov ernment would be  involved  in every  facet of State and local activity.""  Again,  the sponsors of H.R. 5490  assure Congress and the U.S. public  that such broad coverage is not their  intent. But I, for one, am not willing  to rely solely on the stated intent of  the bill's sponsors. Plainly put, I feel  Congress should ""say what it means  and mean what it says""  in the bill,  itself.  During House consideration of the  Civil Rights Act of 1984, many ques tions surfaced regarding the scope of  the bill. For  instance: Will grocery  stores which accept food stamps now  be subject to Federal scrutiny? Federal  architectural standards requiring ex pensive structural changes to provide  access for the handicapped might well  be a financial death blow to small gro cers. If a local fire department accepts  Federal assistance, will the entire city  government be covered? The multiple  compliance  reviews  and massive  re porting requirements necessary merely  to certify compliance with Federal reg ulations would place a tremendous fi nancial burden on already financially  strapped local governments. And, what  about local hospitals which indirectly  benefit from medicaid and medicare?  The Federal Government has already  tried to get New York City to reassign  its teachers in violation of union con tracts to achieve racial balance in the  teaching staff of each school. Under  H.R. 5490, a city could be required to  reassign its hospital staff to achieve  racial balance.  Would a business housed in a facility  financed  through  the  use  of  tax exempt bonds be covered by this pro posal? In the case Consolidated Rail  Corp. against Darrone, a handicapped  individual sued a  railroad which  re fused to employ him. Darrone claimed  that since the railroad received Feder al funds, he couldn't be denied a  job  on the basis of his handicap. Presum ably, the indirect aid of being housed  in  a  facility built with  tax-exempt  bonds could force a business to hire a  handicapped individual even if his or  her handicap might require the pur chase of expensive, special equipment  to accommodate the disability or even  if  the  job might present a  risk  to  handicapped applicant's safety.  One of the most major questions in  my mind involves whether the intent  or the effects standard will be used to  determine violations under  this act.  Must an entity be found guilty of in tentional discrimination, or might an  entity be found in violation of Federal  law merely because a policy or practice  has an unintentional disproportionate  impact?

This  resolution commemorates the largest  neighorhood-based network of public private partnerships at work  in our  country.  From San Diego  to Tacoma,  from  Dallas to Green Bay, from south Port land to Miami; Neighborhood Housing  Services [NHSl programs are at work  rebuilding nearly 200 neighborhoods,  turning  them  into  sound  healthy  places in which to live and do business  for  the benefit of almost 2 million  people.  I have known this program for over  10 years both here and in California  where they have had a track record of  success which is most impressive. Both  in direct and indirect ways, NHS pro grams have saved hundreds of neigh borhoods and stimulated about $2.4  billion of reinvestment in areas which  previously had been written off  as  unsafe  and  undesirable.  Through  NHS's work, homes in these neighbor hoods have been repaired, modernized  and painted; business districts have  been  revitalized;  vacant  lots  have  sprouted the first new construction in  more than a generation and blighted  properties have been converted  into  comfortable homes. In addition to the  almost 200  neighborhoods currently  receiving NHS services, 10 neighbor hoods have reached a level of self-reli ance and virtually turned themselves  into neighborhoods of choice.  It is important, Mr. Speaker, to un derstand that at the heart of each of  these programs is a NHS Board of Di rectors composed of residents, business  leaders and local government officials.  Over the years,  these NHS partners  have contributed resources that build  vibrant communities: Time and hard  work; credibility with neighbors; loans  and other business services; financial  contributions, city services and capital  improvements.  Traditionally,  these  programs' operations have been sup ported by contributions from savings  and loan, banking, and insurance insti tutions. Their contributions to NHS,  both through support for NHS operat ing  budgets  and  to  the  secondary  market for rehabilitation loans for the  NHS nonbankable client, have been  critical to the ability of each NHS to  carry out its mission. Today, in order  for Neighborhood Housing Services  programs  to  expand  their  services,  broader corporate sector awareness of  and support for their work is essential.  the national NHS network is reaching  ",1984
811,374,14,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to share with my colleagues  a wonderful article, written by Carl W.  Struever, that appeared in the Balti more Evening Sun. Mr. Struever, a  Baltimore  building  and  renovation  contractor, offers  fresh  insight  into  the idea of self-help. His concept of  bringing concerned citizens  together  with Government resources to provide  housing for the poor is truly inspiring  and resourceful. It is not surprising  that Mr. Struever  is  an  innovative  leader  in  redevelopment within  the  city  of Baltimore. Hopefully, with  people  like Mr. Struever working  to  provide housing for the poor, commu nities will really be able to help them selves.  The article follows:  SELF-HELP RENOVATORS ARE EFFICIENT, BUT  THEY STILL NEED u.s. CASH  <By Carl W. Struever)  Efficiency in getting the job done does not  beget efficiency in raising the money to pay  for getting the job done. This conflict is a  much neglected shortcoming of one of the  President Reagan's favorite themes: taking  the provision of social services out of the  hands of the federal government and giving  the control to the folks back at home.  For Reagan, step one is giving federal re sponsibilities  to  state  and  local  govern ments. Step two is getting all levels of gov ernment out of the picture entirely, andre sponsibility  into  the hand of  the private  sector. Step three, the ultimate in the deliv ery of social service, is self help-non profit  organizations  and  the  poor  themselves  banding together in a new energy of self  sufficiency.    Given a specific  job-trash collection or  housing construction for example-the local  folks can  in many  instances do a better,  more efficient job <imagine the federal gov ernment in the trash business). Direct ac countability and clear lines of authority can  bring  improved action. Unfortunately  the  flip side of the local folks getting the job  done efficiently  is a corresponding  ineffi ciency in raising the money to pay for the  service.  The farther from the federal government  the more difficult the fundraising job gets.  Thus, states can collect resources <tax> more  easily then cities. Since the private sector  (business> must rely on voluntary contribu tions,  the collection job grows  immensely.  Then the self-help folks have the roughest  time of all because not only must they rely  on voluntary support, but they don't have  much cash themselves to ""volunteer.""  To  illustrate the problems,  let's look at  our  society's  responsibility  of  providing  decent shelter for the poor. Here's a clearly  established track record demonstrating that  local folks can create housing at a far lower  cost than Washington.  For the Feds, low-income housing carries  a high price tag-as expensive as $100,000  for a Section 8 unit, if you add up front-end  production subsidies and ongoing rent subsi dies. States tend to stick to the financing of  housing and stay away from direct develop ment and operating responsibilities. Local ities like Baltimore have become adept at  adapting these state and federal programs  to the capabilities of local builders and the  condition of the city's housing stock. But  even Baltimore's sophistication in housing  development hasn't translated into cost effi ciency: An average ""dollar house"" costs the  homesteader $60,000 to renovate and a city sponsored rehab runs about $50,000.  As the President loves to point out, freed  from federal, state, and local government  participation, a private builder can achieve  substantial economies  from  the  increased  flexibility. However,  the big savings come  from the efforts of small non-profit neigh borhood groups that energize the poor to  help themselves. By getting housing spon sorship away from government and into the  community itself, expectations are dramati cally  transformed;  instead of sitting back  and expecting a rose garden the poor learn  to work hard for modest, decent housing. As  necessity is the mother of invention, scarc.e  cash drives community groups to creat inno vative methods and materials to cut costs,  making effect use of volunteer  labor and  sweat equity.  Anyone doubting  the efficiency of non profits should watch the inspiring self-help  action of the Concerned Citizens for North  Camden. In a community decimated by pov erty and housing abandonment, a  ragtag  group  of  residents  banded  together  to  attack  the  spread of vacant, boarded-up  houses. To protect a house from further  vandalism a homesteader family will move  in without heat or running water. Using a  $1,500  Community  Development  Block  Grant to help pay for wiring and plumbing,  the homesteader will scrimp and save, using  second-hand  and  scavenged materials. A  network of unemployed construction work ers will trade and barter for services, while  the homesteader himself works alongside  doing whatever he can himself. The end  result:  110  vacant hulks  renovated  into  decent liveable houses at an average cost of  $3,000.  On a larger scale in New York City, the  Urban Homesteaders Assistance Board has  helped 10,000 families renovate 375 apart ment buildings in the worst parts of Harlem  and the South Bronx at an average cost of  $2,000 per unit under the Tenant Interim  Lease Program. Faced with accelerating de terioration of building services and decrepit  and failing mechanical systems, the tenants  organize themselves, take over management  from the New York City, collect their own  rents and pay their own bills. With all rents  going directly into building improvements,  rent collections jump from an average of 30  percent with the city as landlord to at times  better than 100 percent as tenant enthusi asm takes hold. Tenants patrol the lobby to  keep out the crooks and recruit friends to  rent vacant apartments as soon as they are  renovated.  The  tragedy  is  the pitiful shortage of  funds  that  frustrates  all  this  positive  energy. The Concerned Citizens in Camden  lost their funding to federal budget cuts and  in New York lack of rehab funds has slowed  the Tenant Interim Lease Program  to a  standstill. This is where the efficiency of  the local folks gives way to inefficiency in  fundraising.  Locked in a fierce competition to attract  business, the state legislatures are reluctant  to  raise  taxes  to pay  for extra services.  Mayors are in even worse shape. With huge  numbers of poor families needing help and  ",1984
812,387,14,Mr.  SEIBERLING.," Mr.  Speaker,  today I am introducing legislation to  provide  tax credits for the purchase  and installation of equipment to tap  low-temperature  geothermal  energy.  The bill would also excuse any tax or  interest due from those taxpayers who  during the last several years mistaken ly took the geothermal tax credit for  low-temperature  geothermal  equip ment based on erroneous advice from  the IRS.  In  1978,  Congress  enacted  the  Energy Tax Act, which included a tax  credit for the purchase of geothermal  energy equipment. That legislation did  not include any wellhead-temperature threshold  requirement  for  the  tax  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  credit. However,  in  1980,  the  IRS  issued regulations prohibiting the use  of the credit for equipment drawing  on geothermal deposits below 50 c  < 122 F). Geothermal deposits of this  temperature are only found in a very  few areas of the Far West. While Con gress enacted the tax credit to encour age the nationwide use of renewable  energy sources,  the  IRS  regulations  limit the use of the credit to a very  small area of the country.  To make matters worse,  IRS field  agents seemed unaware of their own  regulations and advised taxpayers for  several  years  that  low-temperature  geothermal  equipment qualified  for  the credit. Now IRS is demanding that  these taxpayers repay the credit plus  interest. I am told that some taxpay ers in my area called IRS in February  of this year and were informed incor rectly  that low-temperature geother mal-energy  equipment  qualified  for  the credit. Some of my constituents  are now being forced to pay as much  as $4,000 in tax deficiencies plus inter est because  they relied on  incorrect  advice from IRS agents.  I think that the IRS regulations are  contrary  to  the  intent of Congress  when we enacted the Energy Tax Act  of 1978. Congress intended that tax payers around the country should be  able to take advantage of the geother mal and other renewable energy tax  credits. In addition,  it  is outrageous  for IRS agents to be giving incorrect  advice 4 years after the Service issued  its regulations on this matter.  My bill would remove this arbitrary  and unwarranted temperature thresh old established by IRS. Thus, ground  water  heat  pumps, which  extract  energy  from  shallow  underground  streams to heat buildings, would be eli gible for the credit. The bill would also  excuse those who incorrectly took the  tax credit for these devices after rely ing on advice from the IRS.  Ground water is particularly plenti ful in the Northeast and Midwest, and  can be found in streams 50 to 200 feet  below the Earth's surface. It ranges in  temperature from about 77 F in Flori da to 40 F at the Canadian border.  The  temperature  remains  constant  thoughout the year.  Ground water heat pump systems  are considered to be 3 to 5 times as ef ficient as fossil-fuel heating systems in  terms  of heat output per unit of  energy put in. By one estimate, ground  water has the capacity to replace fossil  fuel heating and electrical cooling in  85 percent of the domestic dwellings in  the Northeast-Midwest  region alone.  Surely, this is the very kind of energy conserving system  the 1978 act was  aimed at encouraging.  A number of States have already en acted their own energy tax credit for  gound water heat pump systems.  I  urge my colleagues to carefully consid er this important piece of legislation.e  19009  INTER-AMERICAN FOUNDATION  HON.

813,387,14,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, I have  been an ardent supporter of the Inter American Foundation for the past few  years. Unfortunately,  the  leadership  of that nonpolitical organization has  become  highly  politicized  over  the  past year. What most disturbs me  about this turn of events is that it was  entirely  unnecessary.  The  Founda tion's work,  its past president, Mr.  Peter Bell, and its capable staff were  too busy trying to live up to the Foun dation's mandate to become involved  in politics.  I am submitting an article by Scott  Olesen on the Foundation for my col league's perusal. It will,  I  trust, give  them an important update on the cur rent status of the IAF:  THE  INTER-AMERICAN  FOUNDATION: GOLDEN  DoOR  CLOSING  ON  LATIN  AMERICA-A  COUNCIL ON HEMISPHERIC AFFAIRS  <By Scott Olesen)  On June 15, the Reagan-stacked Board of  Directors of  the  Inter-American Founda tion-a 14-year-old non-partisan government  development  agency  that works  directly  with  grass-roots  organizations  in  Latin  America-nominated  Deborah  Szekely,  founder and director of Golden Door spas in  California, as  the new Foundation presi dent.  The nomination follows a three-year war  waged by the Reagan administration to gain  control  over  the  ostensibly  apolitical  agency, and if carried through would effec tively  squash  the  independence  of  the  United States' most successful development  group.  Szekely  is not yet president. The 4-2  Board vote  in her favor started a 30-day  period in which the Board is  to come up  with a solution satisfying all of its members.  At the end of this period the Board will re convene and cast a final vote under majority  rule, although IAF-watchers do not antici pate that the Board will reach a compro mise on the naming of Szekely.  If the vote remains the same, the Board  will break a non-binding pledge made  to  members of Congress that the presidential  choice would be  reached unanimously, as  had been done on all previous occasions. It  also would violate past Board minutes re quiring unanimous consent.  The ouster last Dec. 5 of the highly re garded Peter Bell necessitated the search  for a new president. Rep. Dante Fascell <D Fla.), chairman of the House Foreign Af fairs Committee, charged that the ouster  was ""the culmination of a three-year effort  by the administration to recast the IAF in  its own ideological mold."" Fascell was the  presiding figure behind the IAF's founding.  Latin American leaders, development orga nizations and members of Congress-includ ing moderate Republicans and Rep. Robert  Garcia <D-NY)-angrily criticized the move,  and three members of the Foundation's ad visory council resigned in protest.

There are a  lot of American people,  the elderly and middle-class people,  who are going to pay a lot in this bill.  They are going to pay $7 billion more  one way or another in Medicare and  medicaid. It is interesting to note that  with one sweep of the pen early Satur day morning, we gave $12 billion to  the major corporations in this country  tax free, as a gift. It was never asked  for. They were willing to pay about $4  billion of that in taxes without even  fighting.  0 1310  So on the one hand we gave, and let  us say that $1 billion of that went to  General Electric; 28 million people in  this country are going to have $8 or $9  billion  in cuts  in benefits while we  gave billions away to General Electric,  TRW, Allied Chemical, Exxon, and  the like.  We cut $35 million out of the poor  people in California for a fine they did  not deserve. At the same time we gave  Boeing Aircraft $35 million  for one  plane that had already been sold at a  profit. We gave Boeing $35 million and  we were arguing whether we would  give  them seven, or eight, or nine  extra planes at $35 million a tax credit  apiece. In the end Boeing got $630 mil lion as a gift and the American public  get to pay for it.  We are caving in today to the ""Real tors"" who are complaining about going  from 15  to 18 years of depreciation.  The real estate industry, in fact, pays  no income tax at all. In 1982, the net  income from real estate in this coun try was a negative $8 billion. Had we  made real estate income tax free, we  would have had $4 billion a year in  revenue to add to deficit reduction.  It is interesting to note that not one  of you on the Republican side or on  the Democratic side came to me and  said, ""I need some help for the people  in my district,"" yet literally hundreds  of you came to me and said, ""I have a  corporation or a rich family that needs  a little loophole in this bill."" We sure  took care of them; but I am not sure  we did anything to be proud of in our  job of taking care of the middle class  or the poor.  This is not a deficit-reduction bill. It  is a dignity-destruction bill.  I want to warn Boeing and General  Electric, which made $2% billion and  got a $500 million refund not so long  ago,  I  do not  think  the American  public, which  is  footing  the bill,  is  going to put up with this type of re verse Robin Hood for very long.

817,413,14,Mr. CAMPBELL.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  commend  the distin guished chairman of  the Ways and  Means Committee and  the  ranking  member, Mr. CONABLE, for their lead ership and their work on the effort to  reduce the deficit. Reducing the defi cit requires painful decisions on both  spending and tax items. This bill could  be considered as the needed first step  in the form of a deficit downpayment.  However, I must inform my colleagues  that there are several onerous provi sions in this bill with long-term spend ing and policy implications.  As a spending conferee I cannot be lieve that in a so-called deficit reduc tion bill we are increasing spending for  welfare  programs.  Some  provisions  were needed, such as the work transi tion allowance which gives health in surance to women who have left the  AFDC  rolls  recently  to go  to work.  However, when we went to conference  under  the public assistance bill  the  Senate had $177 million worth of sav ings and the House had $460 million  worth of spending. By the conclusion  of the conference we had spent $482  million in new public assistance spend ing.  Let me explain a provision that adds  $660 million of new Federal and State  spending over a 3-year period. In the  heat of negotiations we added a $50  disregard  to a  family's AFDC grant  when child support is collected. While  it is generous to give a family an addi tional $50 per month what we were  told at the time was the amount that  this change in the law would cost was  little. Later, after the spending confer ence had concluded, we were told that  over the 3-year period it will cost the  Federal Government $195 million and  the States $450 to $500 million.  This must be revisited. The way the  bill  is written we  are  encouraging  States not to collect child support for  welfare families.  Further, most  State  legislatures  have recessed for the year and do not  yet realize that they are charged with  the responsibility of finding a way to  finance this change in the law. In ad dition, States may decrease their ef forts to collect child support because  currently States retain a portion of  this $50 to offset welfare costs.  It's obvious  that $660 million  is a  drop in the bucket when you are talk ing about a $50 billion tax bill. Howev er,  I am concerned about  the  long term cost as well as the policy implica tions for the program's future.  As the distinguished senior Senator  from Louisiana stated so eloquently  during the conference, ""I've seen these  provisions that are relatively inexpen sive increase a hundredfold down the  road."" He shculd know!  I know the chairman tried very hard  in the area of medicare to protect the  beneficiaries. However, there are sev eral provisions that I oppose.  On the tax side, there are many pro visions that I support. The life insur ance provision, extension of mortgage  revenue bonds, shortening the capital  gains holding period, extension of the  targeted  jobs  credit,  changing  the  heavy use tax, and many of the tax  reform and compliance provisions.  But once again, we adopted several  provisions  that will adversely affect  my district and the national economy.  The  foundation provision will  force  the sale of a newspaper in my district,  the cap on IDB's will slow develop ment  and  growth,  and  the ACRS  change will  hinder  investment and  burden the economic recovery, not to  mention the imputed interest.  I hope my colleagues will carefully  weigh the pluses and minuses of this  legislation. The bill has good and bad,  the call is close as to which outweighs  the other.  Obviously,  the overriding  concern  must be the deficit. But, even here the  Members should note that we do not  yet have the necessary spending cuts  agreed to. We should, as a body, insist  on a balanced deficit-reduction pack age of which approximately one-third  should come from domestic spending  cuts.  So, each Member must weigh  the  whole against the parts. If I vote for  the bill, it will be for the whole as I  am adamantly opposed to some of the  parts. However, no matter how I vote,  I will constantly try in the future to  change the provisions I find onerous.  ",1984

821,426,14,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of adoption of the confer ence report.  Mr. Speaker, I can think of a dozen  excuses, especially during this political  season, for Members to use in running  from this legislation.  But  there's one  overriding  valid  reason for mustering our courage to  support it: we must-we must-demon strate to the American people our de termination to get our Federal fiscal  house in order.  This measure, by itself, won't even  come close to doing the complete job.  However,  it's a  long overdue step in  the right direction.  It's mind boggling to think in terms  of a national debt in the $1% trillion  range. That's what we've got. And it's  almost  sinful  to  think  about  our  present  situation  in which we  are  spending more each year just for the  annual interest on our national debt  than we are for all of our federally  aided job training and education pro grains combined. Talk about priorities  being out of whack.  On top of all this, we have projected  deficits-absent any definitive action  on our part to the contrary-that will  find us at the end of this decade with  a national debt approaching $2% tril lion.  Clearly, something has to be done to  reverse this trend. It used to be that  talk of deficits, prime interest rates,  the national debt and other supposed ly esoteric subjects like the interrela tionship  between  fiscal  policy  and  monetary policy was heard only on  Wall Street or in oak paneled board  rooins. No more.  Now,  and  I have  the evidence  to  prove  it,  these subjects are also dis cussed on Main Street as well as Wall  Street.  Invariably, one of the first questions  asked at one of my frequent citizen  forums-others might call them town  meetings-same thing-back home  in  the  real world goes  something  like  this: ""When are you people in Wash ington going  to do something about  this fiscal mess we're in?""  Today we have an opportunity  to  provide an answer to that most serious  and very meaningful question.  And, we have an opportunity, by  casting what can legitimately be de scribed as a ""tough"" vote,  to send a  clear signal to all who are concerned  and are watching, not just back home,  but in the community beyond, here  and aboard, that we intend to back up  our words with deeds  in coming  to  grips with the aptly described ""fiscal  mess.""  The measure before us  is but one  piece of the overall puzzle that we are  attempting to put together, one that  involves an overall-House version-3year $182 billion deficit reduction pro gram.  It  is an  integral part of  the  whole.  Through a combination of spending  cuts ana revenue raisers, we have a  change to make a $60 billion-plus con tribution to the kitty.  We're doing it, I think, in the proper  and prudent way. Perhaps a better  way  to approach  it is by describing  what we're not doing. We're not rais ing individual tax rates. That's good.  We're not abandoning income tax in dexing, a system under which the big  gainer from  inflation  is Government  and  the big  loser  is  the  taxpayer.  Maintaining our commitment  to  in dexing is also good. What we are doing  is  implementing reforms  to our Tax  Code and closing many of the loop holes which are being taken advantage  of by only the most advantaged in our  society. No need to recount them all,  they have been more than adequately  addressed during this debate.  Another  important aspect of what  we are about falls under the heading  of what I refer to as the ""spreading  the pain"" concept. No one segment of  our society is singled out for particu larly harsh treatment, yet many seg ments are being asked to give a little.  That's reasonable. That's fair.  The conferees haven't come up with  a perfect plan. Far from it. There are  a  number  of  provisions,  taken  by  themselves, which probably could not  and would not survive an up or down  vote. They, too, have been thoroughly  discussed here this afternoon. I've got  my pet peeves with the overall meas ure, but upon sober reflection, I'm re sisting the temptation to dwell on the  individual parts rather than concen trate on the overall package. I guess  that's called realism. Or perhaps prag matism.  We need to be realistic and pragmat ic as we get on with the job that needs  to be done. And this is just the begin ning. Before concluding, Mr. Speaker,  I think it very much in order to pay  tribute to the leadership of the com mittee which painstakingly fashioned  this compromise measure. They have  been superb in advancing the national  interest in a truly bipartisan manner.  Particularly do I wish to praise the  work and leadership, not just on this  measure, but on so many that have  preceded  it during his very distin guished 20-year career in the House,  of  the ranking minority member of  the Ways and Means Committee, my  ",1984
822,439,14,Mr. DONNELLY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  strongly  support  the  reconciliation  conference report on H.R. 4170. It rep resents a major portion of the $182 bil lion  deficit  reduction  package  con tained in the fiscal year 1985 budget  resolution the House passed in April.  It is a much-needed deficit downpay ment which reduces the deficit by ap proximately $63 billion over the next 4  fiscal years.  There  is  near  unanimity  among  economists  that  the  unprecedented  deficits projected through the end of  this decade are a grave threat to the  future of the economy. While this leg islation is in no way a solution to the  deficit crisis, it is a necessary first step  toward  reducing  the  deficit.  The  taxing and spending policies in effect  since 1981 have resulted in a  funda mental imbalance between taxing and  spending. This conference report, by  ending certain abuses of the Tax Code,  freezing some tax expenditures sched uled to go  into effect in the future,  and slowing the growth of non-means tested entitlements, puts a hold on  further growth of that fundamental  imbalance.  Any conference report that is  the  result  of  the  difficult  negotiations  that have occurred over the past few  weeks will contain provisions that indi vidual Members  find  objectionable.  This one  is no exception. I consider  the liberalization of the capital gains  tax rules contained in the bill to be a  particularly  undesirable  addition  to  the Tax Code. The temporary reduc tion of the holding period required for  an asset to qualify for long-term cap ital gains  treatment  is hardly a  tax  benefit designed for the poor, or the  middle class. Rather,  it will benefit  large  investors,  stockbrokers,  and  market speculators. Not only will  it  cause a revenue loss of some $640 mil lion, it will also contribute further to  the current instability of the financial  markets. This deficit reduction pack age is designed to bring stability to the  financial markets; liberalizing the cap ital gains rules surely undermines that  goal.  However, this provision is part of a  much  larger package addressing nu merous  tax and spending  issues.  Its  passage  is  vitally necessary  to  the  country's economic well-being. Despite  my objections to individual provisions  of this conference report, I support it  as a whole. Now is the time for Con gress to back up its rhetoric about the  importance  of  reducing  the  deficit  with responsible action. I welcome the  opportunity to vote for this bill.e  e ",1984
823,439,14,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in  support  of  the  conference  report on H.R. 4170 although I do so  with mixed feelings.  Clearly, this legislation makes some  long overdue and necessary changes in  our tax and spending laws. The confer ence agreement provides for a compre hensive  revision of antiquated  rules  governing the tax treatment of life in surance. A number of  tax  loopholes  that cost the Government millions of  dollars while encouraging unproduc tive investments have been eliminated  or at least tightened. The increasing  costs of  the Medicare and Medicaid  programs have been somewhat reigned  in while  coverage  for children and  pregnant women has been expanded.  Over $3 billion will be saved by imple menting some of the Grace Commis sion's cost-cutting recommendations.  As with any tax legislation, there are  provisions in this bill that I find ex tremely distasteful. In my view,  the  single most damaging aspect of this  bill  is  the cap on industrial develop ment bonds.  I  think it  is vital  that  IDBS be used only for projects that  will benefit the general public. And in  this  sense,  I  think  the Ways  and  Means Committee did a commendable  job. But my  home State  of New  Mexico is one of the poorest States in  the Nation with respect to per capita  income. The per capita cap on  the  volume of  IDBS  that a State may  issue will place a severe and I believe  an unwarranted limit on New Mexico's  efforts to expand its economic base.  I am also deeply disturbed that the  conference  committee  chose not  to  extend R&D tax credits. I believe that  in the long run this move will cost us  much more in the area of technologi cal advancement than it will save the  Treasury. Our future economic growth  will rely heavily on our ability to de velop new and innovative technologies.  But, Mr. Speaker,  for  all  of  its  faults, I plan to vote for the deficit re duction package. I will do so because  this legislation is successful in reduc ing next year's anticipated deficit by  roughly 7 percent. While  this  is  a  small step, I  think this bill makes it  clear that the deficit problem must be  addressed one step at a time.  For those who oppose this bill, for  whatever  the  reason,  I  offer  this  thought: a deficit reduction package  would not be necessary if the Federal  deficit was not at a level that threatens our economic stability. And  the  root of this dangerous problem is not  the economic policies of the past 30  years as some would have us believe.  The cause of this problem is the poli cies of the Reagan administration over  the past 3 years.  When Vice President BusH heard  Presidential candidate Ronald Reagan  claim he would cut taxes, dramatically  increase military spending and balance  the budget, all at the same time, Mr.  BusH  termed  the  plan  ""voodoo  economics."" But President Reagan was  not dissuaded by his running mate's  skepticism. While he possessed  the  magic to get his voodoo economic pro gram  enacted,  he didn't have  the  magic  to make  it work. The Presi dent's supply  side  economic experi ment brought us to the brink of eco nomic collapse. Not since  the Great  Depression had so many Americans  been without work. Businesses were  faltering at unprecedented rates. Ac cording  to  the nonpartisan Congres sional Budget Office, our huge Federal  deficit is a direct result of President  Reagan's tax and spending policies.  Mr. Speaker, the conference report  on H.R. 4170 is tough medicine indeed.  But if we are going to cure our deficit  illness, we must swallow hard and vote  yes.e  e ",1984
824,439,14,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr. Speaker, I  reluctantly  support  the  conference  report on H.R. 4170,  the Deficit Re duction Act of 1984.  A little over 2 months ago, when the  House passed H.R. 4170 and sent it to  the Senate, I said on the floor that de cisive action was needed to reduce the  deficit. I noted at that time that the  prime interest rate had just risen from  11.5 percent to 12 percent.  There  is no doubt  that  the huge  deficits projected  in  the President's  budget are creating tremendous con cern  in  the  financial markets. The  public  is  justifiably  skeptical about  our resolve in dealing with this prob lem. Just last week the prime rate rose  agian, this time from 12.5 to 13 per cent. It's clear that the Congress has  to do something to demonstrate a will ingness to get control of the budget.  The National Association of Home  Builders,  in a  letter I  received from  their president this week in support of  H.R. 4170, say:  The current $200 billion deficit is trigger ing expectations of inflation and pushing up  interest rates .... You must act or risk fur ther increases in interest rates, which would  lead to a housing recession and stifle the in vestment needed  for a  continuing strong  economy.  I agree with this assessment of the  interest  rate  picture,  and  for  this  reason, more than any other, support  this package which will at least make  a $63 billion cut in the projected defi cit over the next 4 years.

857,478,14,Mr. SHAW.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of this provision which, if en acted, will provide the General Serv ices Administration with a cost-effec tive alternative for converting leased  space into Government-owned space.  This is a good provision and I com mend the chairman and ranking mi nority member of  the subcommittee  for including it in the bill; but I would  add that I think when changes of this  nature  are made  there  should  be  greater communication between  the  Appropriations and Authorizing Com mittee.  I know we are both concerned about  the Government's sustained dependen cy on leased space and the shrinking  amount of resources available for Fed eral construction and that we would  all  like  to see additional reforms of  this nature enacted.  Currently, roughly 90 million square  feet of office  and  related  space  is  leased  nationwide which  represents  over 40 percent of the Government's  total space inventory.  Not too long ago, leased space repre sented  less  than 20  percent of our  total space inventory.  In Washington, DC, we lease over 30  million square feet of space or half of  our agencies' total space requirements,  and this space need is growing.  The General Service Administration  testified last week that the Treasury  Department has a pending expansion  request for fiscal year 1984 for an ad ditional  1.6 million  square  feet  of  space for 16,000 employees.  And it doesn't stop there-this bill  adds another 858  employees  to  the  Treasury Department who will need at  least another 120,000 square feet of  space.  Where will  these  employees go with no funds available for construc tion? The only place  they can go  is  into leased space.  Both the Congress and the adminis tration need to make a greater com mitment to providing the necessary re sources for either construction or the  purchase of buildings so that Federal  employees can be housed in Govern ment-owned  space where  long-term  savings in space costs can be found.  If we are not going to provide these  resources  then at the very  least we  must provide positive alternatives such  as that being provided by this provi sion.  Under  this provision, as  I  read  it,  GSA would be able to lease Govern ment land on which buildings could be  constructed which we would in turn  lease back and then acquire at the end  of the lease term-20 years.  This lease, of course, would be sub ject  to  congressional  review  as  re quired by the Public Buildings Act of  1959 as well as the normal solicitation  procedures now set by regulation.  Aside from the primary benefit of  owning the building at the end of the  lease term, the lease itself should be  cheaper since any potential developer  should be able to accrue savings by fi nancing the project at a lower interest  rate and the cost of the land will not  have to be included in the rental rate.  This authority could be utilized im mediately  here  in  the Washington  area.  GSA owns 10.6 acres on which build ings could be constructed at the Feder al Triangle, 60.5 acres at the Washing ton Navy Yard, and 241 acres in Suit land.  These combined sites could accom modate the construction of 14 million  square feet of office and related space  which, if built out, would reduce our  leased inventory in the city by almost  half.  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman,  this  provision provides the type of reforms  which are necessary and  is  exactly  what I and my colleagues are trying to  accomplish with  the  legislation we  have introduced to amend the Public  Buildings Act of 1959.  Again,  I would commend my col leagues on  the Appropriations Com mittee for including this provision in  the bill and I yield back the balance of  my time.  The CHAIRMAN. Are  there  points of order against title IV?  Are  there any amendments  remainder of title IV?  The Clerk will read.  The Clerk read as follows:  any  to  the  SEc. 507.

858,491,14,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Chairman,  I would hope  that  this amendment  could be adopted because I  think at  that point it takes out the discrimina tion against a specific class of people,  and that is women, women who are  working for the Federal Government,  and they are being treated very differ ently if this does not happen.  What we are looking at is, if we look  at the history of it, insurance carriers  and health providers negotiate con tracts with  the Office of Personnel  Management  to  participate  in  the  health care program and those con tracts always say what is covered and  what is not covered.  The problem that we have at this  point is section 619, which says that  abortions are not covered, and section  619  says,  ""Well,  for  the  life of  the  mother they are covered.""  the  language of  the bill now  stands, an insurance carrier or health  care provider has  to  really  try and  figure out whether  the  life of  the  mother would be endangered if carried  to  term,  and  it  is  a  very difficult  burden to place on a health care pro vider.  My amendment makes the judgment  the same as it is in any other issue,  and that is the health of the patient,  and whether the health of the patient  is in danger. I point that out over and  over and over again to make it very  clear. Nobody  is  talking about abor tion on demand. They  are  talking  about only allowing these things when  the health of the patient is in danger.  That is why any other thing is allowed  under health care provisions. You only  do bypasses if the person needs it, not  because they think they would like it.  You only do any other kind of surgery  because they need it and their health  requires it.  This treats a class of recipients of  these benefits, that is, women, in the  same manner that every other class of  recipients of health care benefits  is  treated, by putting ""health"" in as the  qualifier, rather than putting in the  most extreme, which is ""life.""  I  think  that  is only fair because,  again, I continue to point out to this  body it is very difficult. This is really  one of the most difficult decisions any body has to make because it is a bal ancing act between two lives and two  sets of health conditions, and on and  on. It is the type of thing that is very  hard to draw a bright line on, black  and white, right and wrong. It is the  type  of  thing which  the Supreme  Court and everyone else has held to be  within the personal purview of some one's own home, their doctor, their re ligion, and their own problems.  Clearly, the health modifier makes  it very important. I would hope that  the Members  of  this  body would  accept this amendment an treat every body the same. If you negotiate for a  health policy, it should indeed be that.  If we do not do  that,  then we are  saying that women are negotiating for  a life policy and the men are getting a  health policy. That, I do not think,  will hold up in a court and I just think  that this  is what is  fair and this is  where we should be moving.  D 1900  ",1984
859,491,14,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment does  not, in my hopeful expectation, need  an awful lot of debate. I  think it is  very clearcut.  The  gentlewoman  from Colorado  has  taken  the qualifier,  ""except  to  save the life of the mother"" or ""except  if the life of the mother would be en dangered if the fetus were carried to  term,"" as the sole exception to permit ting abortion, and she has changed  that to ""the health of the mother.""  So it is very simple. Do we trade an  unborn  life  for a  judgment by  the  doctor that the health of the mother  is going to be affected, or do we leave  the tradeoff where it is today, a  life  for a  life? That  is  the  tradeoff, an  equal claim to life.  But  the  gentlewoman wishes  to  downgrade the tradeoff to ""the health  of  the mother."" Will she have mi graine headaches? Will she get tired?  Will she be debilitated? Will her circu lation be affected? Will she be de pressed? Does she have morning sick ness?  Any of these conditions, which can  go from ""aardvark"" to ""zebra,"" affect  her health, and that is the gentlelady  from Colorado's tradeoff. We extermi nate  the unborn child because  the  claim is that the health of the mother  is affected.  That is no tradeoff, Mr. Chairman.  That  is hardly a  life  for a  life. So  make no mistake about what you are  being asked to do.  Now, when we make the health of  the mother the exception, think about  that. Why,  there have been laws  in  California, as I recall, where two doc tors had to certify, and it was serious  health damage, but we here do not  bother with that. It is just the health  of the mother.  Mr. Chairman,  I  suggest  to  the  Members if we want to open the barn  door for abortion on demand, then we  should vote for this amendment. But  if we want to uphold the policy of this  body and  this Congress which has  been the law since 1976, we will say,  ",1984

867,504,14,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, I offer  an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. FRENZEL: At  the end of the bill, insert the following new  title:  ",1984
868,517,14,Mr. REGULA.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. LIVINGSTON], a member of  the subcommittee.  ",1984
869,517,14,Mr. LIVINGSTON.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of H.R. 5898, the mili tary construction appropriations bill  for fiscal year 1985.  I want to com mend the chairman, Mr. HEFNER, and  the ranking minority member, RALPH  REGULA, for the leadership they exhib ited with regard to this bill. As always,  they have equitably addressed all of  the controversial issues, and have gra ciously responded to every Member's  concerns about certain military con struction projects.  Members  staff  and  subcommittee  staff are particularly to be commend ed for their hard work and coopera tion in dealing so successfully with our  concerns.  Mr. Chairman, this bill is worthy of  this Chamber's support  for  several  reasons, some of which Mr. HEFNER  and Mr. REGULA have already touched  on.  First, the savings in this bill from  the administration  request are sub stantial. Just over $2 billion from the  original $10.3 billion request was cut  by the committee ..  Nevertheless, the total recommenda tion for military construction is still  $1.1  billion over  the 1984  approved  amount. We have provided very impor tant increases in almost every military  construction category: Army milcon,  $422.2 million above 1984 levels; Navy  milcon,  $242.9 million  above  1984  levels; Air Force milcon, $132.2 million  above  1984  levels;  Reserve  Forces  milcon, $100 million above 1984 levels;  Army  family  housing,  $72 million  above 1984  levels; Navy /Corps hous ing, $35.7 million above 1984  levels;  and Air Force housing, $26.3 million  above 1984 levels.  Some of the key policy  issues ad dressed by this bill include increased  emphasis  on  European-NATO  con struction  programs,  Persian  Gulf Indian Ocean projects, and improve ment of the quality of life for our serv ice personnel.  One of the unnoticed but equally im portant issues addressed in this bill is  a requirement granting American pref erence for contractors in the Persian  Gulf-Indian Ocean sector and the Pa cific  territories,  including Kwajalein  and Johnston Islands.  In addition, for the first  time, the  Defense Department will have to ad vertise  in  the Commerce Business  Daily for all overseas and NATO con struction projects exceeding $5 mil lion. This mandate contained in the  committee report will increase Ameri can contractors' chances in competing  more effectively overseas.  Both Mr. HEFNER and Mr. REGULA  are  directly  responsible  for  the  progress the committee has made in  these areas, and their efforts should  not go unchallenged. However, there  are certain areas not addressed in this  bill which I hope will be connected in  conference.  Mr. Chairman, I urge Members of  this Chamber to support the 1985 mili tary construction appropriations bill.  ",1984
870,517,14,Mr. REGULA.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  2 minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Oklahoma [Mr. EDWARDS].  ",1984
871,517,14,Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma.," I will  not take the 2 minutes. I just wanted  to say that this bill, which we have  worked on for quite some time, is in  fact, I think, despite what the gentle man from Minnesota said, a very good  attempt to work out a reasonable posi tion on a variety of issues with a lot of  pressures coming at us from a lot of  Members of this Congress, all of whom  have interests in their own districts. I  think the chairman of this subcommit tee, with whom  I have worked  for  some time, and the ranking member,  have done an outstanding job in trying  to put together a bill that addresses  not only  the needs of  this country  militarily and the needs of the various  congressional districts involved, but in  trying  to keep  it within  reasonable  limits.  We have fought very hard against  Pentagon requests which were unrea sonable. We  have  held  very  high  standards in terms of design, in terms  of trying to make sure that there was  no attempt by any member of  the  committee or subcommittee to put in  place things that could not be totally  justified. We have set things aside to  come back to them later.  I would urge all of my colleagues on  this side and that side both to support  this bill. It is a bill we can all be proud  of.  ",1984
872,517,14,Mr. REGULA.," Mr. Chairman, I have  no further requests for time, and I re serve the balance of my time.  ",1984
873,517,14,Mr. HEFNER.," Mr. Chairman, in re sponse to the gentleman from Mine sota, we have probably had as many  hearings on this bill as any committee  in the House. We have had as wide a  range of people come before this sub committee during our hearings as any  subcommittee in this House.  We have had small business people  come in and talk with us. We have put  the pressure every way that we know  how for more host nation support. We  have put pressure on the State De partment, Secretary of the Army, and  all of the people from the Pentagon to  try  to  encourage  increased defense  spending  from our allies. We have  done everything that we know to try  to make this a very lean bill. I might  add that this bill is about $1 billion  less than the military construction au thorization bill.  We have done a good job on this bill  and I would like to alert those that are  thinking about across-the-board cuts  to look very closely at them because  we have done a very good job of bring ing forth a responsible bill.

875,556,14,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, once  more I congratulate the Chaplain for  the excellence of his prayer this morn ing. It is extremely appropriate, very  insightful, and worthwhile.  I might say, by  the way,  that at  some point I hope that we will gather  together the morning prayers of the  Chaplain  and  publish  them  as  a  Senate document. I will consult with  the minority  leader  and with  the  Chaplain on that, and we will discuss  it further at another time.  12  SENATE SCHEDULE  ",1984
876,556,14,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President,  there  are seven special orders this morning;  and  that,  together with  the  leader  time  and  morning  business,  will  occupy us until noon.  At noon, the Senate will resume con sideration of the math-science bill.  I announced yesterday that I antici pated that we would try to proceed to  consideration of the State-Justice ap propriations bill this morning, instead.  But after consulting with the distin guished chairman of  the Appropria tions Committee and other Senators,  it appears to me that it would be the  better part of discretion to go ahead  and consider the unfinished business,  instead of going to State-Justice right  away.  So we are still going to do State-Jus tice, and I hope we can complete it  before we go out for the Fourth of  July recess. But it is anticipated by  the leadership on this side that we will  stay on the unfinished business after  we  resume  its  consideration  at  noon.  Mr. President, as Senators know, we  have worked out most of the problems  of the math-science bill except for a  couple of issues, and they are impor tant ones. We still have the so-called  equal access issue which must be re solved. I continue to hope that that  can be worked out, and the parties to  that controversy have indicated to me  separately that they think they are  very close  to an agreement.  I urge  them to try to complete the negotia tions on that matter and bring us an  amendment dealing with equal access  that can be dealt with promptly.  In addition to that amendment, I am  advised that the distinguished Senator  from  Illinois  [Mr. PERcY]  plans  to  offer  the  youth  age  differential  amendment, which  I believe has al ready been reported by the committee,  and it is known to Senators.  Those two issues will be dealt with  today on the math-science bill, and I  hope we can complete both of them in  advance of the time that the House of  Representatives may  transmit  to us  the conference report on the deficit  reduction package. We will take up the  deficit reduction package when it is  available, and I hope we can finish it  in short order.  I am advised-! have not checked on  this personally, but  I  should have  done so before we convened this morn ing-that there are no amendments in  disagreement  on  that  conference  report. If that is the case, we will have  As  sudden and swift disposition of it, be cause all we can do is debate it. That is  essentially what we will do. It may be,  then, that we can dispose of the con ference report much earlier than I had  thought.  I announced earlier  this week,  and wish  to  reiterate, we will  stay  today as  long as necessary  to finish  that conference report, and that may  mean late in the evening, although I  hope that the fact that there are no  amendments  in disagreement on the  conference  report-if  indeed  that  turns out to be the case-may shorten  the  time  required  to deal with  this  matter in the Senate. I will attempt to  make a further appraisal of that situa tion  and  an  announcement  to  the  Senate later in the day.  Mr. President, after we do math-sci ence and after we do the deficit reduc tion package, our old friend the debt  limit is to be dealt with. I still am not  sure how the House will present that  matter to us.  I understand that the Rules Com mittee will  report a  rule on a debt  limit bill  today.  I may be mistaken  about that, but I believe that is cor rect. That probably means that we will  not receive the debt limit bill until to morrow. In what form it reaches us re mains to be seen, of course.  In addition, Mr. President, there is  the State-Justice appropriations bill,  which is only one of the regular appro priations bills available to us. I should  like to finish that measure before we  go out; and, at the very least, I should  like to have it pending and debated.  No doubt  there are other matters  that have escaped my attention at this  time, Mr. President, and I will consult  with  the minority  leader on  them.  However, what that suggests to me is  that there still is some possibility that  we can go out on Thursday evening,  but I would not encourage Senators to  plan on it quite yet. We will see how  this day unfolds.  Mr. President, I believe that is all I  have this morning. If I have any time  remaining, I yield it to the minority  leader.  ",1984
877,556,14,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I  thank  the distinguished majority leader for  outlining the program as he has done.  Can  the  distinguished  majority  leader indicate whether or not he sees  action before the recess on the confer ence report on the budget resolution?  ",1984

879,582,14,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, on  Monday,  June  25,  the Wall Street  Journal carried a  lead editorial that  must go down as the worst editorial of  the  year.  The  .editorial  headline  shouts:  ""Star Wars Works.""  ""Star  Wars,"" of course, is another name for  the antiballistic missile system which  the administration prefers to call the  strategic defense initiative. What pur pose does the antimissile system pur port to serve? It would shoot down in coming Soviet missiles  before  they  could  reach  their American  target.  Virtually every competent expert not  on the Pentagon payroll or employed  by a potential ""Star Wars"" contractor  has said that ""Star Wars"" almost certainly would not work. Now the Wall  Street Journal says-forget all  that  scientific skepticism. ""Star Wars"" does  work. Well does  it? What does  the  Journal offer as proof? It says the Air  Force has  just conducted a  test  in  which an interceptor actually hit and  knocked out a non-nuclear-missile sim ulating a Soviet missile. That does it,  says the Journal. It works.  But does  it? The Journal does not  say that this was the fourth effort by  the Air Force  to  intercept a missile  and this was the only one that worked.  It does not say that the Defense De partment's own experts and champi ons of ""Stars Wars""  tell us that we  will not, in their judgment, know if an  antimissile system will work for many  years. When asked at Senate hearings  whether  they would know whether  the system would work 5 years from  now if the Congress agreed to spend  $25 billion in research as the adminis tration is requesting, the Defense De partment's experts  say  ""no""  they  would need more time and even more  research dollars. Perhaps some time in  the early 1990's, after the proponents  have spent $50 billion or so on re search, they say they may able to give  us an answer or a tentative answer. So  8 or 10 years and $50 billion from now  the Defense Department can give us  their opinion. They may or may not  then say ""Star Wars"" will work and  they may or may not be right. But at  least it will be an opinion based on  what is probably the most expensive  expenditure in history to find out the  answer  to anything. And-it will be  the opinion of the proponents, not the  opinion of the opponents, and not the  opinion of an unbiased judge.  The Wall Street Journal editorial ig nores all this expert folderol and ap plies  the good old Journal common sense. After all, one out of four tests  worked to knock something out of the  sky. So ""Star Wars"" works?  What other proof does the Journal  offer to convince us that ""Star Wars""  works? It argues-once ""Star Wars"" is  destroyed we won't have to knock ev erything out the first time. The first  line of defense may knock out 50 pe:r cent. But we  can defend  in  layers,  three or four layers, and you may have  a  90-percent knockout  rate. Result,  says  the Journal-the Soviets don't  attack. Of course,  this overlooks  a  whole series of options open to the of fense. They can harden the skin of the  incoming missiles. They can  fire  in  endless decoys. Or they can, as Secre tary De Lauer,  the administration's  own prime point man on ""Star Wars""  admits, simply increase the number of  offensive missiles.  What is  the Defense Department's  answer to this option? Get ready for  this.  The  Defense  Department's  answer is: We'll keep the Soviets from  producing more  offensive missiles.  ",1984
880,595,14,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Oregon is recognized.  ,1984
881,595,14,Mr. HATFIELD.," Madam President, I  thank my colleagues who have given  so much of their time and effort to not  only this amendment but to the per fecting amendment which I will offer  shortly. This has certainly been a sub ject of great concern I know to all Sen ators, and we all approach this subject  I suppose from a little different per spective. But I know that the Senator  from Alabama [Mr. DENTON] has been  very deeply  involved and concerned  about this matter for some time, as are  the rest of who started about 3 years  ago on this subject. Senator LEAHY has  given a great amount of time to work ing out some of the objections that  were raised on the House floor to the  Bonker-Perkins  legislation  at  that  time.  Senator  BUMPERS,  Senator  GORTON, Senator DANFORTH, Senator  KASSEBAUM,  and  Senator WEICKER  have participated in expressing their  viewpoints, and many others as well.  In  no way  by  enumerating  those  names should it be taken to mean that  I am committing these gentlemen and  lady to crossing every ""t"" and dotting  every  ""i""  in  the perfecting amend ment.  I think we have to recognize, first of  all, that this can be interpreted, I sup pose, in two different ways.  The  Senator  from Alabama  has  spoken  about  religious  activities  as  such and the circumscribing of those  religious activities. I believe you can  equally present this case as purely a  matter of freedom of speech and free dom of assembly.  Religion might be a secondary con sideration, because, basically, what we  have today in the United States is a  growing practice of providing opportu nities for students in high schools to  voluntarily  associate  themselves  to gether in common interest, to pursue  association of that common interest,  whether it be music, philosophy, poli tics,  camera and picture  taking, or  whatever-except for rap sessions or  association dealing with religious sub jects.  I need not go through the litany of  cases that have been heard by the var ious courts of this land, from Lubbock,  TX, to New York and to other States,  where a very narrow interpretation of  the Constitution has,  in effect,  im pinged upon the freedom of speech of  students.  It has not happened only in the reli gious subject field. It has happened in  the political subject field as well.  There was a very famous case of a  girl who was the daughter of a Quaker  minister who, during the Vietnam war,  wore an armband to school to protest  our Vietnam war policy. It was inter preted by school officials as a political  statement and as such was not allowed  in the classroom, was not allowed in  the school halls. The girl was sent  home. The court ruled that school ad ministrators had no legal constitution al right to short circuit a student's po litical rights.  Moreover, we had the case at the  University of Missouri where students  were provided facilities of the campus  to organize voluntarily for a common  purpose on any subject field except re ligion. They were not allowed to use  the school facilities as a religious club.  When  the Supreme Court of  the  United States decided this case, they  stated, in effect, that once an institu tion sets up the right of a forum, that  institution cannot dictate the content  of  the  forum without violating  the  freedom of speech.  Therefore, I would like to emphasize  at this point the question of freedom  of speech.  Madam President, this is not some thing  that  just has come  into my  thinking or the scope of my concern  during the days, weeks, and months  past, in which we have been engaged  in questions of school prayer, constitu tional amendments, and all of that. I  think the record is pretty clear. I op posed one and all.  Yet, I feel very strongly that just be cause  it  is  a  religious  subject, we  should be no less vigilant about the  freedoms and the rights in our Consti tution than we are on any other sub ject.  I know  that  there are  those who  have great concern about our schools,  as I have, being infiltrated by all kinds  of cults and bizarre groups represent ing  religious  causes. Or,  there  are  those  who  are  equally  concerned  about secular humanism and commu nism  invading our schools and mis leading our students. Far be it from  me to say that the Federal Govern ment should regulate school curricu lums or school procedures. I am fully  committed  to  the  proposition  that  schools and education in general must  be under the guidance and control of  local  school  districts,  local  school  boards, States school boards, and so  forth. But where  there  is an action  that is taken by such an official body,  representing the public schools, which  denies  a  right  that  is  guaranteed  under the Constitution, then the Con gress of the United States, I think, has  a duty and an obligation to step in and  remedy that violated right.  That is what we are doing in regard  to the Grove City case, so far as civil  rights  and  discrimination  are  con cerned. I am a cosponsor of that, be cause I do not believe, when Federal  aid is provided that schools, even pri vate schools have a right to descrimin ate. There is a nexus between educa tion and civil rights. Let us be vigilant  though, whatever the subjects may be.  I remember that a number of years  ago, when the head of the Communist  Party, Gus Hall, was making a sojourn  around the college campuses of Amer ica, raising his banner of Communist  doctrine and advocating the Commu nist Party, he was scheduled to appear  at  the campus of  the University of  Oregon. There were many protesting  citizens of our State who paid their  taxes  to  support  the University of  Oregon and who felt that it was inap propriate  to permit a Communist to  come on that campus and speak. We  had protests, we had demonstrations,  we had all kinds of public outpouring  against this meeting that was to be ad dressed by Gus Hall.  Many persons appealed  to me  for  intervention, to deny the right of free dom of speech of Gus Hall at  the  campus, and I refused to do so. In no  way did I endorse,  in no way did I  agree with, in no way did I sympathize  with what Gus Hall might be stating  in that meeting. But, at the same time,  the Communist Party had not been  outlawed. It was a legal entity in this  country; and for a person to be denied  the forum that was set up by the uni versity for many other speakers, repre senting other points of view in their  subject fields, it did not seem to me to  be correct constitutionally or ethically  to say no to him.  ",1984
882,608,14,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator has the right to modify his  amendment.  The amendment was so modified.  The amendment <No. 3152), as modi fied, follows:  At the appropriate place add the follow ing:  TITLE  : THE EQUAL ACCESS ACT  That this title may be cjted as the Equal  Access Act.  SEc.  . (a) It shall be unlawful for any  ""public  secondary  school which  receives  Federal financial assistance and which has a  limited open forum to deny equal access or a  fair opportunity to, or discriminate against,  any students who wish to conduct a meeting  within that limited open forum on the basis  of the religious, political, philosophical, or  other content of the speech at such meet ings.  ""(b) A public secondary school has a limit ed open forum whenever such school grants  an offering  to or opportunity for one or  more noncurriculum related student groups  to meet on school premises during nonin structional time.  ""(c) Schools shall be deemed  to offer a  fair opportunity  to students who wish  to  conduct a meeting within its limited open  forum  if  such school uniformly provides  that"" <I) the meeting is voluntary and student initiated;  ""(2) there is no sponsorship of the meet ing by  the school,  the government, or its  agents or employees;  ''<3> employees or agents of the school or  government are present at religious meet ings only in a nonparticipatory capacity;  ""(4) the meeting does not materially and  substantially interfere with the orderly con duct of educational  activities within  the  school; and  ",1984
883,621,14,Mr. DOLE.," Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased  to  join Senators HATFIELD,  LEAHY, and BUMPERS  in offering this  perfecting  amendment. The  amend ment will achieve every objective of  the original compromise equal access  language proposed by Senators HAT  FIELD and DENToN; at the same time, it  will clarify and strengthen certain as pects of that language  to guarantee  the consensus support  the proposal  merits and deserves.  Over 2 years ago. the Supreme Court  held, in Widmar against Vincent, that  institutions of higher education are re quired by the first amendment to give  student  religious  groups  the  same  rights of access and free speech af forded nonreligious student organiza tions.  Unfortunately,  two  circuit  courts-in the Brandon and Lubbock  cases-subsequently  held  that  that  same  first amendment  required sec ondary schools to ban religious groups  from school premises.  Conservatives and liberals alike have  criticized these two circuit court cases  as carrying Supreme Court precedents  in the school prayer area to illogical  extremes.  Specifically,  it  has  been  pointed out  that under  these cases,  schools  may  not  remain  neutral  toward religion, but are forced into a  posture of being hostile toward it by  refusing  to allow virtually any  reli gious activities on school grounds. Yet,  the Supreme Court has never prohibit ed  truly voluntary,  student-initiated  and  student-led  religious  activity  during noninstructional periods. And  this is all the students in these two  cases were asking for.  The goal of the equal access amend ment will clarify what should be obvi ous-that student groups do not shed  their first amendment rights to free  speech and association simply because  they want to meet for religious pur poses.  Specifically,  it will  prohibit  public secondary schools which allow  nonreligious groups  to meet during  noninstructional periods from denying  the same  right  to  religious student  groups, so long as the activity is volun tary and student initiated and there is  no sponsorship of the activity by the  school or its agents.  While the equal access concept has  always had strong, broad-based sup port, various  suggestions have been  made about how to  tighten and  im prove  the  two bills originally  intro duced: S. 815,  introduced by Senator  HATFIELD and S. 1059,  introduced by  Senator DENTON. As a result, certain  improvements  were made  by  the  Senate Judiciary Committee when it  overwhelmingly approved S. 1059 sev eral months ago. Still more  refine ments were made in the compromise  proposal jointly sponsored by Senators  HATFIELD and DENTON. This final ver sion creates even greater clarity about  what the bill does and does not re quire. As a consequence,  the legisla tion has achieved consensus support in  this body, and has been endorsed by a  wide range of religious and civil liber ties groups. As such, it represents the  legislative process at its best.  Perhaps  the most  important  im provement made by  this perfecting  amendment is to clarify the meaning  of  a  ""limited  open  forum.""  This  change will preclude a  school  from  practicing one policy toward the use of  school  facilities  by  student groups,  while  officially  adopting  another.  Both religious and secular clubs will  benefit from this clarity. At the same  time, the change will remove certain  ambiguities  about whether,  for  in stance,  extracurricular  field  trips  taken by a science class would trigger  the legislation's equal access require ment. Specifically, this is addressed by  the bill's definition of ""limited open  forum"" to encompass only those stu dent group meetings that are not di rectly related to the school's curricu lum.  A second, very important change, is  the language in the amendment which  would clarify that the legislation does  not authorize schools to permit out side groups to have access to school fa cilities. This strengthens that portion  of  the  amendment which  requires  equal access only for student initiated  activities.  Finally, the amendment makes abso lutely clear that school and other gov ernment officials should not partici pate  in  student  religious meetings,  should not require students to partici pate, and should not seek to influence  the form or content of the meetings.  This  provision  goes  to  the  very  premise of the legislation, which is to  guarantee true state neutrality toward  religion and religious activities.  Mr.  President,  I  believe Senator  DENTON should be commended for his  leadership in introducing equal access  legislation and  in securing Judiciary  Committee approval of his proposal.  Similarly, great credit should go  to  Senator  HATFIELD  for  introducing  equal access legislation and for devot ing so much time and effort to work ing out this perfecting language. As a  result of his efforts, Senate passage  appears guaranteed, and  it  is much  more likely that this important meas ure will be enacted this year.  ",1984
884,621,14,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, the  amendment before us today makes it  unlawful  for  any  public  secondary  school that receives Federal financial  assistance to deny equal access or a  fair opportunity to meet in the school  during noninstructional times on the  basis of the religious, political, philo sophical  or  other  content  of  the  speech at such meetings, if the school  permits one or more noncurriculum re lated student groups to meet during  that time. It incorporates the impor tant goal of preserving the full first  amendment rights of secondary school  students in a way that does not create  a Federal intrusion into the legitimate  exercise of school discipline and educa tion. More importantly, the proposal  achieves this with no Government en tanglement in the content of religious  speech or the nature of religious activ ity.  The proposal makes it clear that all  purely  student-initiated  extracurric ular activities are to be granted the  same treatment whether their purpose  is political, philosophical, or religious.  The language makes it clear that the  activities must be both voluntary and  initiated by students.  It extends  that protection  to stu dents who constitute a small minority  within a school's population as well as  to  those whose  activities  attract  a  larger group.  And it retains the right of school au thorities to regulate the extracurric ular activities on their premises,  in cluding the timing and the inclusion  of any outside speakers.  The proposal does not force a school  to organize any kind of extracurricular  activity for any purpose. Nor does it  force a school to permit the indiscrimi nate incursion of any and all outsiders  into the school premises.  ",1984
885,647,14,Mr. STENNIS.," Mr. President, we  have before us the conference report  on H.R. 4170, the Tax Reform Act of  1984. This bill is the result of several  months of discussions  and negotia tions by the leaders of both Houses, as  well as the President.  Naturally,  in  a  bill of  this kind,  there are many cross currents and  pressures  from  various  sources  for  changes in the tax law. Certainly in a  situation of this kind there is just no  way to satisfy everyone. The Treasury  Department is looking for more money  and the general public is looking for  ways to pay less in taxes.  As a general proposition, I support  and commend the efforts of the Mem bers of Congress who worked so long  and diligently on this very complicated  bill, and especially want to thank the  Senator from Kansas [Mr. DoLE], and  the  Senator  from  Louisiana  [Mr.  LoNG], and the other members of the  Senate Finance Committee for  their  work and their efforts. Certainly the  bill is not perfect, but it is a step in  the right direction in making an essen tial downpayment on reducing the tre mendous  budget  deficit which we  project over the next several years.  I am keenly disappointed, however,  that the amendment which the Senate  adopted relating to the continued rec ognition of the tax-exempt status of  industrial  revenue  bonds  issued  by  States and local political subdivisions  was revised by the conferees in major  particulars so as not to really meet the  situation that we face in trying to at tract  industry,  particularly  to  our  smaller States, and thereby create jobs  to help build our economy and raise  the standard of living of our people.  The conferees approved a  statewide  cap applicable  to  industrial  revenue  bonds which in many instances will be  entirely too restrictive. There should  be no cap on the creation of jobs be cause that is the lifeblood of our econ omy which adds to our tax revenues  and reduces the number of people and  the expenses on our unemployment  roles.  The President has pointed out  in  one of his addresses several months  ago that for every 1-percent increase  in unemployment, the Federal Treas ury loses $26 billion-$13 billion in lost  income tax revenues and another $13  billion  expended  in  unemployment  compensation. The creation of  jobs  adds to the tax revenues, it does not  cause any net reduction in Federal rev enues.  During consideration of this tax bill  by the Senate, we approved an amend ment continuing the small issue excep tion for industrial revenue bonds ex tending the present expiration date of  the  law  recognizing  the  issuance of  such bonds from December 31, 1986, to  December 31,  1990, an additional 4  years. The conferees agreed on an ex tension of  this sunset provision  for  manufacturing facilities to December  31, 1988.  While I am pleased that industrial  revenue bonds for the establishment  of manufacturing facilities will contin ue to be recognized through 1988, this  really should be permanent law and I  think it is essential that the Senate Fi nance Committee commence detailed  hearings early next year developing all  of the facts showing the importance of  the creation of  jobs,  the additional  revenues to be derived therefrom, and  the overall benefit to the economy and  the welfare of the Nation of this in dustrial revenue bond program. I will  strongly support  the efforts of  this  committee to develop these facts and  will work  for meaningful  legislation  which will  eliminate  any  possible  abuses and continue, on a permanent  basis, this very sound program which  originated  in Mississippi  almost  50  years ago.  Mr. President, I am interested great ly in this bill. It is a tremendous bill. A  world of work was done on it. Every thing did not come out just as I would  have written it, but I think it is a step  forward,  in  the right direction, and  carries forth the merit.  As I said, I was especially interested  in  revenue  bonds;  there  are  some  changes  I  did not  favor, but some  changes of a kind had to be made. So,  Mr. President,  I am supporting  the  bill.  I thank our committee and the con ference committee, too, for their work  on the subject matter.  Mr. METZENBAUM addressed the  Chair.  ",1984
886,647,14,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senator from Ohio is recognized.  ,1984
887,647,14,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President,  I noted with great interest that the  President supports this bill and that  the distinguished manager of the bill  pointed out to all Senators that the  President wants this bill.  Well, I would like to point out that  although the President wants the bill,  the Republicans in the House of Rep resentatives did not support him; 76 of  them voted yea, 86 of them voted nay,  and who were these Members of the  President's party who  saw  fit  to  oppose him? The ranking member of  the Budget Committee, DEL  LATTA  from Ohio; the great orator who made  the speech at the Republican National  Convention, Mr. VANDER  JAGT, Mr.  PHIL GRAMM, Mr. JACK KEMP, both of  the CRANES, and a number of others.  So I think when we look at this piece  of legislation, we ought to understand  that  the President's own  party  is  having trouble accepting it.  But frankly, Mr. President, I do not  rise because  those Members opposed  this legislation. I rise because this con ference report which we have before  us today is the end result of a process  that began many months ago in the  rose garden of the White House. The  measure was worked out in most of its  details by the President and the Re publican leadership. It has been pre sented to the public as a downpayment  on the deficit. Come on. Who are we  kidding? Let us take a look, Mr. Presi dent, at what is really and truly con tained in this package. This package is  a bill that takes care of  those who  have and places additional burdens on  those who have not.  Do we have before us a bill that sim plifies our overcomplicated tax laws?  Of course not. The answer is no. Does  this legislation bring with it more in  the way of fairness and equity for the  average taxpayer? Of course not.  What this legislation does, simply, is  the same thing that every tax bill en acted under  this administration has  done. It panders to the special inter ests, swells the deficit, and increases  the tax bill of Mr. Average Joe work ing guy.  Mr. President, there is one consola tion. It does take care of some people.  ",1984
888,647,14,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, will  the  Senator yield?  I wish the Senator would be more  specific. I like his speeches, as I hear a  lot of them. But this bill is primarily  reform, and I have gone over a list of  the things tightened up.  If there are specific areas where we  have hurt the average taxpayer and  have not gone after others-! know  the Senator is about to mention one if he will look at the eightor nine page summary, we have tightened up  many of the things the Senator from  Ohio was out front on.  ",1984
889,647,14,Mr. METZENBAUM.," I will not deny  the fact that the conference report in  some respects is better than the bill  that left the Senate, but that does not  make it good. That makes  it just a  little bit less bad.  The fact is that the bill has made  very happy men and women of the  special  interest  lobbyists who  have  ",1984

891,660,14,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President,  I  say  to  the Senator from New York  that  I was not here  for his entire  speech with reference  to this deficit  reduction package. I have the greatest  respect for the Senator's analysis and  reasoning.  But let me say to him that to vote  against  this package because of the  notion that we do not have the caps  on appropriations seems undefensible.  I think if we had enough time here to night we could prove to him unequivo cally  that  the package and  the ar rangements made  publicly  between  the President and the Appropriations  Committee and on which the Appro priations  Committee  has  recently  acted publicly, are an assurance of the  caps  on  appropriated  accounts  for  1985. The Appropriations Committee  has adopted the same number-$139.8  billion-that was in the Senate-passed  cap but, I believe now has even a little  more strength.  The appropriators now have agreed  on how  that $139.8  billion will be  spread, what subcommittees it will be  going to and the sum total. They have  agreed not to exceed that figure and  for the first time we have the Presi dent's concurrence  in advance as  to  the allocation.  Frankly, I do not see how anyone,  knowing the way we do business, can  think that that is less than a substan tive  cap of  the  same number  that  would have to wait the passage of ap propriations bills, add  them up, see  what happened when  they were all  finished, and exercise a point of order  after they were all finished if they ex ceeded the amount.  So I think on that score it is an abso lute draw.  With reference to the other cap, de fense,  let me repeat: There are only  two numbers being discussed on defense  for  the  fiscal year 1985. The  number we voted on here, $299 billion  in budget authority, and a number the  House had put in their recommenda tions  of  $286  billion. The  cap we  talked about was the $299 billion. I ask  does anybody think that is going to be  exceeded when  the difference  is be tween that and $286 billion? Frankly, I  do not think that has anything what soever to do with how much is going to  be spent.  If you want  to  talk about other  things, you could. But the cap issue  really no longer makes any difference  in terms of the deficit. We could not  put 11  appropriation bills here  to night, add them up to $139.8 billion in  budget authority, and say we have a  cap.  I think you have the best assurance  we have ever had that you are not  going to exceed that. So there may be  other reasons  the Senator does not  like the package. But certainly that is  not a valid one. I thank the Senator  for yielding.  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.  ",1984

Mr.  President,  I  yield  to my colleague  from Georgia  who would like to make an observa tion, before I make a motion to table. I  yield for a statement without yielding  the floor.  I yield to the Senator from Georgia  without relinquishing my right to the  floor.  ",1984
893,660,14,The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.,"  Is  there objection? Hearing none,  the  Senator from Georgia  is  recognized,  but the Senator from New York has  the floor.  ",1984
894,660,14,Mr. MATTINGLY.," I thank you, Mr.  President, and  I  thank  the Senator  from New York.  Briefly, I would like to say when we  all came together in the beginning to  support the Rose Garden strategy, I  think those of us who did not like to  raise taxes supported that program. I  think that was fine. But this is not the  Rose Garden strategy, nor is this the  policy of  the package  that  left  the  U.S. Senate. I guess in honesty every body would have  to say we did not  expect  that same package  to come  back. We did not expect  this exact  package to come back by the confer ees. I understand that. I think every body in here understood that.  But I  think  this  is somewhat  less  than we really expected to come back.  I think the Senator from Kansas and  the Senator from Louisiana have done  their part on the tax portion. I think  for us to get up here and debate the  tax portion is not really the core of  the argument because I think then we  get to nitpicking. But I think what the  core of the argument is,  is how this  package is going to impact our people  out in the country, whether this pack age is going to be an encouragement  for them to work, whether it is going  to be  an encouragement  for  those  people to save, and whether it is going  to be an encouragement for people to  invest. People can read. When  they  read  this  tomorrow,  if this package  passes, they are going to understand  that they got $51 billion worth of tax  increases, $11  billion or $20 billion,  whatever the figure may be of spend ing  restraints, and  the rest of  it  is  going to be smoke.  It is irrespective. I know we have dif ferences of opinions on that. But the  only guarantee that people of America  had when this package went out of  here were the real tools to control the  spending. Those were the caps. Those  caps were not  there.  Irrespective of  what we may say, the last hope you  have of a real cap when spending on  appropriation bills exceeds  the  limit  that we have set for ourselves is if the  President is going to veto it. I would  say unfortunately  that  is  remote.  I  think that is unfortunate.  So the point is that we have set here  4 years in a row of raising taxes. I do  not think that is the reason we came  here. I do not think that is the reason  we  try  to encourage people and the  free enterprise system  to move  for ward. The free enterprise system  is  the goose  that  lays  the golden egg.  The free enterprise system is the eco nomic recovery, and is  the economic  expansion. It seems to me if we look at  this tomorrow, and it passes, they are  going to look at us and say, you know,  the only thing we could really solidly  believe about you is that you passed  $51 billion in tax increases, and about  $11  to $20 billion in cuts. When are  you going to give me the rest of it?  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.  ",1984
895,660,14,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," The  Senator from New York has the floor.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President,  let  me  simply  conclude  by  saying we  passed  the 3-year  statutory  cap  in  May. Now we have a 1-year sense-of the-Senate  resolution  which  the  House does not have to concur with  and,  indeed, has not concurred with.  This is not restraint. Let us not kid  ourselves. The House is not going to  concur in it unless we hold their feet  to the fire, and the time to do  it is  now. Let me suggest something else. I  think  the chairman of  the Budget  Committee did a brilliant job in May.  It was absolutely a brilliant package  and a stroke of 3-year tax. I would just  hope we have the courage to go back,  insist that we have those cuts, because  we have been talking about spending  restraints, and we have not done it in  the 3¥2 years that I have been here.  Mr. President, I move to table the  conference report.  ",1984
896,660,14,Mr. DECONCINI., Would the Sena tor withhold?  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes; I withdraw my  motion to table.  ,1984
897,673,14,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, it is with  considerable reluctance that I have de cided to support the conference report  on  the Omnibus Deficit Reduction  Act. I opposed this legislation when it  was passed by the Senate because the  bill called for sharp cuts in Medicare  and precedent-breaking mandatory ap propriations caps on spending.  There are still major deficiencies in  this legislation. Although scaled back,  Medicare premiums are still due  to  rise. The proposed $3  a month  in crease  to be phased  in over several  years may not seem much  to some  people, but for many people even $3  weighs heavily on a monthly budget.  The package also does nothing to scale  back Pentagon spending, even though  the Senate showed substantial senti ment  for  a much  lower  spending  target than the one proposed by the  President.  I also remain concerned about the  impact  on  the Nation's Synthetic  Fuels Program of the $2 billion rescis sion from the energy security reserve.  The conference  report does contain  language indicating that the rescission  was made with the understanding that  the five vacancies on the Board of the  Synthetic Fuels Corporation will be  filled and that the Board will submit  an operating plan to the Congress. I  can only hope that the administration  shares this understanding so that we  can get  the SFC Program back on  track. Even though publicly owned fa cilities such as  sewerage plants are  exempt from the cap imposed on the  amount of  industrial  revenue bonds  that State and local governments can  offer, it will be a  long-term drag on  economic activities in West Virginia.  The conferees made some notable  improvements in the bill. The confer ence agreement deletes most of  the  Medicare cuts which would have di rectly affected elderly and disabled  beneficiaries. Equally  important,  the  conference agreement eliminates  the  two separate caps on appropriations  for defense and nondefense programs  for the next 3 years, as well as the new  points of order against any bill exceed ing those caps.  By rejecting the two separate caps  on  appropriations,  the  conference  agreement  leaves  the door open for  Congress  to shift funds between do mestic and military programs while re maining within an overall  spending  limit. This flexibility  is vital if Con gress is to respond effectively to the  shifting needs of the Nation.  There have been other  important  changes as well. Several of the more  onerous  tax  proposals  have  been  muted or dropped altogether.  I was  particularly pleased that the coal de pletion allowance was not singled out  in  the  conference  agreement  for  unfair treatment relative to other nat ural resources. Although  the confer ence report goes further  in altering  ""* * * fear  the capital gains  treatment of coal  royalty payments  than the proposal   that I cosponsored, I am hopeful that  the delay and grandfathering provi sions included in the conference agree ment will allow  time for adjustment  and possible change in this provision. I  was also relieved that the conference  agreement moderated the shift in real  estate depreciation at a  time when  pressures on the housing industry are  already increasing.  Moreover, there is an overwhelming  need to curb the massive Federal defi cit. On Monday,  the prime rate  in creased for the fourth time in as many  months. The President explained away  the rise by attributing it  to an un grounded  of  the  future  * * * ."" This is no phantom phobia, Mr.  President, but a fear based on the fact  of enormous and rising deficits and in terest  rates. Let me examine  for a  moment the dimensions of the prob lems we face:  The 1984 deficit  is expected to be  around $180 billion-more than three  times the size of the last Carter deficit  that was so vilified in the 1980 cam paign;  By the end of the decade, the defi cits are projected to rise well over $200  billion  even with healthy economic  growth. Without serious changes  in  spending and taxing, some experts put  the end of the decade deficit above  $300 billion;  The deficits are now so large that  they  threaten  to  take  almost  two thirds of the pool of savings available  for new investments;  The rising tide of red ink will raise  all interest rates-and sink a growing  volume of investments;  A  rising Federal  deficit means  a  rising public debt.  In 4 years, Mr.  President, the current administration  will have virtually doubled the public  debt. For the first time since the end  of World War II,  the public debt  is  going up in relationship to GNP. In  effect, the future debt burden on the  average American has been going up;  With the larger debt, come larger in terest payments-so  large  that  they  will wipe out the effect of most sav ings cuts and make it harder for the  country to meet its investment needs  and its commitment to opportunity.  The deficits, Mr. President, are no  longer  the subject of arcane discus sions  among  policy  analysts. They  have become a bloated spider sitting in  a growing web of economic problems.  The  coming  collision  between  growth and growing deficits will force  interest rates ever higher. It is an eco nomic pattern that clouds the present  and darkens the future.  Rising interest rates threaten to fur ther erode  the American dream of  owning one's own home. The recent  jump in mortgage interest rates has al ready dampened housing starts and  home sales. More than half the homes  31-059 0-87-22 (Pt. 14)  now  sold carry variable  rate mort gages. To buy a house, hundreds of  thousands of Americans have had to  gamble on the good sense of the ad ministration and the courage of the  Congress.  The impact of rising interest rates is  already sweeping  through  the small  business  community,  endangering  a  key part of  the American economy  that is an engine for innovation and  employment growth.  As interest rates rise, investments in  the future will fall. Students will be  forced to put aside their plans for edu cation. Ambitious research plans will  be scaled back. Businesses will  first  delay and then cancel orders for new  factories or the latest piece of equip ment.  The international dimensions of the  budget deficits are equally grave. As  the growing budget deficits push inter est rates upward, the debt burden of  the developing world is increased, en dangering  emerging  democracies  in  several countries, and threatening the  stability of the financial system itself.  Large American banks have lent heavi ly  to developing countries  in Latin  America  and East Asia.  In  several  cases,  the amount of their exposure  exceeds their stockholders' equity. It  is a house of credit cards  that can  easily be tipped over by deficit-driven  interest rates.  The Federal deficits are also linked  to our record trade deficits. Rising in terest rates have helped push up the  international value of the dollar. In  effect,  this administration has put a  tax on every export and given a subsi dy to every import.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have printed in the RECORD  a  letter I received from the President.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  THE WHITE HOUSE,  Washington, DC, June 27, 1984.  Hon. ROBERT BYRD,  Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  in a  DEAR RoBERT: As  the Senate prepares to  vote on  the Conference Report on H.R.  4170, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, let  me reiterate my support for this major ele ment of the deficit reduction package.  This measure, which was fashioned  bipartisan manner, contains both spending  reductions and measures to close tax loop holes of questionable fairness. The tax pro visions are consistent with  the downpay ment plan target, and many of the key pro visions providing for structural reform and  curtailing tax abuses were included in my  Fiscal 1985 Budget.  Most  importantly,  the tax provisions of  the downpayment package contain no  in crease in individual tax rates.  The adoption of this Conference Report,  coupled with the remaining components of  our downpayment package, will help ensure  ",1984

900,686,14,Mr. RIEGLE.," Let me say again that  before he left the floor only moments  ago, and I do not think he would mind  my saying this, I spoke with Senator  STENNIS, who has served in this body a  long time. We talked about this legis lation. He asked to be listed as a co sponsor of the legislation because he  feels so strongly, as I do, about what is  happening  to  these young children  who come home at the end of a school day  to a home where no parent  is  present because one or both of  the  parents, whatever the case is, is work ing at that hour and cannot be home.  He  is  concerned enough about  the  issue to want to be a cosponsor and I  am particularly delighted he has de cided to do so.  ",1984
901,686,14,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, I com mend the Senator from Michigan-for  his leadership in addressing the prob lems of latchkey children. The need  for afterschool care cannot be denied;  32 million children under the age of 18  have mothers who work. Many  of  those children go home day after day  to an empty house.  However, I unfortunately cannot at  this  time support  the Senator from  Michigan. The math-science bill is not  the vehicle for his amendment. It is  extremely important that this bill be  expedited. Each amendment  that  is  considered decreases the chances that  S. 1285 will become law. I feel strongly  that amendments, even friendly ones,  must not be accepted at this time. It is  my understanding that if this amend ment is approved, there are 20 other  amendments waiting in the wings to  be brought  forward-each  involving  additional  spending  and which will  result in a possible veto  if a vote is  ever reached on the bill.  Since  the majority  leader has as sured us that the legislation will come  up in July if a time agreement can be  reached-which  appears  quite  cer tain-! shall vote to table.  ",1984
902,686,14,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment  to help communities establish after school programs for latchkey children.  Last  year,  the  Senate  children's  caucus held its first hearing on the  millions  of American  children who  must look after themselves when they  return home from school. The risks  they  face  are many,  ranging  from  abuse and assault  to alienation and  injury.  The youngsters we heard from told  us quite  eloquently  that  they pre ferred afterschool care programs  to  staying at home alone. As one first  grader from Anne Arundel, MD, said:  ""I don't have to be afraid any more.""  or, as a third grader from Washington,  DC; put it: ""I can play with my friends  instead of being alone;  it makes me  happy.""  Senators RIEGLE and PELL, members  of  the children's caucus,  introduced  the bill  forming  the basis  of  this  amendment subsequent to last year's  hearing.  I was pleased  to cosponsor  that legislation and am pleased to sup port this amendment.  Mr.  President,  I  trust  that  the  Senate will take this first step toward  eliminating the serious risks facing the  millions of younger Americans who  are latchkey children.  ",1984
903,686,14,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise  in opposition  to  the proposed  School Facilities Child Care Act which  has been offered as an amendment to  S. 1285,  the Education for Economic  Security Act. This legislation would es tablish a new, federally administered  categorical grant program designed to  assist  local  schools  in  developing  before and after school child care fa cilities. This legislation is both costly  and controversial.  Mr. President, I recognize that there  is a growing demand in our country  for  increased  child  care  facilities  before and after school. I do not agree,  however,  that  the Federal Govern ment should  impose  itself on State  and  local  governments  in order  to  insure  that  these services are avail able. In fact, the need for these serv ices  is  already being  addressed by  State, local, and private-sector initia tives. In addition, substantial Federal  support, both financial and technical,  is already available from a variety of  sources. I believe that the provision of  child care services can best be accom plished by State and  local govern ments and the private sector with the  support of existing Federal programs,  rather than the creation of another  new Federal program.  I should like to point out, Mr. Presi dent, that the administration strongly  opposes this legislation. Currently, the  Federal Government provides assist ance to States, localities, and families  for child care through the $2 billion  dependent  care  tax  credit,  and  through technical assistance provided  by the Office of Human Development  Services in the Department of Health  and Human  Services.  In  addition,  President Reagan's Advisory Council  on Private Sector Initiatives is specifi cally encouraging and working for the  expansion of employer-sponsored child  care services.  The approach taken in this legisla tion is wrong because it inappropriate ly involves the Federal Government in  decisions concerning the use of schools  and other local public facilities which  are traditionally the province of State  and  local  governments.  It actually  gives  the Secretary of Health  and  Human Services the responsibility to  choose between competing applicants  in the same jurisdiction for program  funding. There is no  involvement of  State or local governments in the se lection of the best or most appropriate  school or agency to provide the serv ices.  Mr. President,  this  legislation also  fails to include any protections which  would  insure  that Federal funds do  not simply replace State, local, or pri",1984
904,699,14,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President,  I  am  deeply concerned about the serious de cline in the quality of math and sci ence education in this country. I be lieve that we need to take immediate  action to address this problem. That is  why I am supporting S. 1285, the Edu cation for Economic Security Act.  In 1960, John Kennedy called on the  American people to join with him in  me~?.ting the challenges of  the New  Frontier. We responded  to  that call  and moved our economy into its most  dynamic decade of growth in this cen tury. We did it by expanding opportu nities for all of our citizens and by set ting new standards of excellence  in  education, research and development.  The world has changed dramatically  since then and so have the challenges  that confront us.  Our  scientific  and  technological  leadership is being overtaken by com petitors  throughout  the world,  the  productivity of our workers and indus tries  is  lagging behind  that of our  trading partners, and the foundation  of educational excellence upon which  we  built  our  international  preemi nence is being eroded by a rising tide  of mediocrity. Our educational system  is simply not providing the education  in science and technology which is re quired in order for our young people  to move into high-technology jobs.  In business,  in government, and in  the military, science is becoming the  key to success. My own State of Ohio  has come to the realization that even  ""smokestack America"" is a high-tech nology  industry.  Just  outside  of  Canton, OH, a new steel processing fa cility is being built. Much of the oper ation will be computer controlled and  will use sophisticated materials-han dling  techniques  and  equipment.  While steelmaking experience will be  important, high-technology education  will be just as vital for workers at this  plant.  As our need for scientific and engi neering personnel increases, we are in  danger of drawing down our pool of  qualified personnel to dangerously low  levels. We can no longer tolerate sub standard instruction in math and sci ence in our public schools, yet we lack  incentives for highly qualified persons  to take teaching positions. This legis lation addresses this problem by pro viding  scholarships  and  teaching  awards to students planning to teach  in areas of critical need. I have long  been an advocate of  this approach  and, in fact, have introduced similar  legislation on this issue.  The challenges of international com petition  and  technological  change  place a premium on the kind of long term  investments  in education  that  this bill provides. I urge my colleagues  to join me in supporting this impor tant legislation.  ",1984
905,699,14,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. President, I wish  to clarify several issues concerning the  asbestos-in-schools  initiative  adopted  by the Senate on June 6, as an amend ment to the bill before us, with the  distinguished Senator from Vermont,  who serves as chairman of both the  Education Subcommittee and the full  Committee  on  Environment  and  Public Works.  It is my understanding that the As bestos School Hazards Abatement Act  of 1984 applies to sprayed-on materi als, materials that are used for wrap ping pipes and boilers, acoustical ma terials, and other materials that are  capable of releasing asbestos in school  buildings.  ",1984
906,699,14,Mr. STAFFORD., The Senator from  South Dakota is correct.  ,1984
907,699,14,Mr. ABDNOR.," Would the Senator  agree  that  the  full  committee  he  chairs, which has primary jurisdiction  over the activities of the Environmen tal Protection Agency,  intends  that  the Office of Toxic Substances admin ister  and  implement  the Asbestos  School Hazard Abatement Act  of  1984?  ",1984
908,699,14,Mr. STAFFORD.," Again, the Senator  is correct. Further, it is  the express  intent of the committee that the funds  allocated under this provision be an  add on to the funds that are otherwise  utilized by the Office of Toxic Sub stances. That is,  these funds are  in tended to supplement money already  being spent by  the Office of Toxic  Substances on its various programs, in cluding  those  funds  that  are  now  being utilized to provide technical and  other assistance on asbestos in schools.  We would therefore anticipate the cre ation of at least eight additional per manent full-time positions to adminis ter this program.  ",1984
909,699,14,Mr. ABDNOR.," Does my colleague  from Vermont agree that the Environ mental Protection Agency,  in estab lishing  the Administrator's priority  list,  is  intended to rely primarily on  the information contained in the ap plications submitted by the local edu cational agencies and the Governors'  priority lists?  ",1984
910,699,14,Mr. STAFFORD.," Yes;  that is our  intent. In addition, the committee rec ognizes  that when  schools  submit  their applications for assistance, they  may not have actually selected  the  contractor to perform abatement. In  these circumstances,  the Administra tor may need to use a two-step process  in evaluating requests for abatement  funds. The first step would provide for  ",1984

931,790,14,Mr. SASSER.," I want to take this oc casion  to emphasize my support for  the fiscal year 1985 funding level set  for the U.S. Travel and Tourism Ad ministration  [USTTAl ),  an  agency  which I consider to be at the front line  in pursuit of two national goals: First,  the coordination of national policy for  what some argue convincingly is our  Nation's largest  industry,  the  travel  and tourism industry; and second, the  direction and governmental assistance  necessary  to  increase  our Nation's  share  of  international  tourism  re ceipts-an effort that will help the in dustry and the U.S. economy on the  whole.  As a founder and cochairman of the  Senate Tourism Caucus, I cannot un derscore sufficiently the importance of  the USTTA to these objectives.  It is imperative, therefore, that the  Senate's proposed funding level of $13  million for the USTT A be maintained  when this appropriations bill goes to  conference with the House of Repre sentatives.  Let me  illustrate with  additional  detail the importance of the two na tional goals I have just defined.  First, there is  the size of the U.S.  travel industry and its importance to  our national  economy. Most econo mists and travel experts readily con cede  that travel and  tourism consti tute at least the second largest indus try in the United States. Others argue  with this contention, pointing out with  some justification that the methodolo gy in determining what constitutes a  trip or travel is somewhat arbitary and  open to dispute. Modification of the  methdolology would easily make it the  Nation's largest business.  Even with the methodology in use,  travel and  tourism constitute either  the first, second, or third largest in dustry in 41 of our States.  First or second in size, the travel and  tourism  industry's  significance  has  never been lost on the members of the  Senate tourism caucus. Nor has it been  anything but paramount among my  own concerns.  Take my home State of Tennessee  for instance. My family and I spend a  great deal of vacation  time  in  the  State. During 1981, we traveled across  the State, visiting and staying at some  of the hundreds of tourist attractions  Tennessee has to offer, and attending  some of the festivals and events one  will find at any time of the year in the  State.  The U.S. Travel Data Center says  that  during  that  yearthe most  recent  for which  such  figures  are  available-travel and tourism generat ed 73,000 jobs in Tennessee. This is 4.2  percent of all the jobs in the State,  making it the State's second  largest  employer. The industry's payroll ex ceeded a half-billion dollars; represent ed over $2.7 billion  in expenditures;  provided $113.4 million in taxes to the  Federal Government, $97.5 million to  the State, and $30.1 million to Tennes see's local governments; and made the  State realize $25.09 for every dollar it  budgeted for tourism.  First or second largest, the signifi cance and importance of the industry  to my home State is clearas it is to  the other States in which the industry  is the first or second largest.  States, the data seem to suggest, are  more sensitive  to  the  importance of  travel and tourism to their economy  than is the U.S. Government. In fiscal  year 1983-84, for instance, they spent  $147 million on  tourism promotion that's over 10 times what we want to  allocate the USTTA in this bill.  If the States are more sensitive to  the economic importance of travel and  tourism than is  the Federal Govern ment, we can certainly expect  that  other nations are at least as aware.  And the data do indeed confirm this.  For instance, one thing which Egypt,  Tunisia,  India, France, Belgium, Ja maica,  Italy,  Canada,  Switzerland,  South Korea, Spain, Greece, Brazil,  Mexico, Czechoslovakia  all  have  in  common is  that they spend more on  tourism  promotion  than  does  the  United States, according to the most  reliable data available.  Clearly,  the case  is before us. We  owe more  to  the effort  to promote  travel  and  tourism  to,  and within  these great United States of America.  And  this,  too,  is  the  thrust of  the  second major goal  in which a  fully  funded USTT A is the key component.  In 1976, the year of our national bi centennial  celebration,  the United  States held a 13-percent share of the  world's  1976  $45  billion  tourism  market. Since  then, our competitive  position has declined; the U.S. share  today is just 10 percent.  ""It is no coincidence that the decline  parallels reductions in funding for the  Federal international promotion pro gram,"" explained William D. Toohey,  president of the Travel Industry Asso ciation of America,  in discussing the  decline earlier this year during a panel  discussion. ""Even though the private  sector and many States and cities in creased budgets during this period in  an attempt to keep up with the ex panding  competitive markets,  they  ",1984
932,803,14,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr.  Speaker,  in  May, a group of more than 200 con cerned attorneys in Los Angeles sent a  letter  to Attorney General William  French Smith calling  for a prelimi nary  investigation and  the appoint ment of an independent counsel for a  full criminal investigation of the ad ministration's  involvement  in  the  mining of Nicaraguan harbors. The  letter cited numerous possible  legal  violations as well as 28 U.S.C. section  592, which requires a preliminary in vestigation whenever information con taining a specific allegation of a crime  is presented by a credible source. The  text of the letter, which was published  in the Los Angeles Daily Journal on  May 4, is reprinted below. I commend  it to the attention of my colleagues:  LA WYERS COMMITTEE FOR ETHICS IN  INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,  Los Angeles, CA, May 2, 1984.  Re: Ethics  in Government Act, 28 U.S.C.  Sections 591, et seq.  Hon. WILLIAM FRENCH SMITH,  Attorney General of the United States, U.S.  Department of Justice, Washington, DC.  DEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL SMITH: This is to  request that pursuant to The Ethics In Gov ernment Act (28 USC  § 591, et seq.), you  cause to be conducted a preliminary investi gation and apply  to  the Federal District  Court for the appointment of an independ ent counsel to conduct a full criminal inves tigation of the information set forth herein.  That information is taken from reports car ried by the Los Angeles Times and the New  York Times, from which  it would appear  that persons in the Administration have en gaged in activities which may be violative of  the criminal laws of the United States, par ticularly  the Neutrality Act and statutes  prohibiting  the export of explosives and  combining to destroy  the property of na tions with which we are not at war, all as  more fully set out below. Those reports fur ther contain information to the effect that  this conduct has been authorized by Presi dent Reagan  and CIA Director William  Casey.  Americans working for the Central Intelli gence Agency on ships off Nicaragua's Pa cific Coast have been supervising the mining  of Nicaraguan harbors  in recent months.  Harbors mined include Corinto, Puerto San dina and El Bluff. Administration sources  state that the mining operation marks the  first time since the United States began sup porting Nicaraguan rebels three years ago  that Americans have become directly  in volved in military operations against Nicara gua. Administration  sources  have  stated  that  the actual placement of  the mines  inside Nicaraguan territorial waters is han dled by an elite group of Latin American  commandos  trained,  financed  and  super vised by the Central Intelligence Agency.  On April 7, 1984, The New York Times re ported that an Administration official said  that Americans made  and deployed  the  mines. The same report states that NicaraEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  guan rebel sources have said the mining was  undertaken by special C.I.A. unit that in cluded  guerrillas  from  the Nicaraguan  Democratic Front and the Democratic Rev olutionary Alliance as well as other Ameri can  intelligence operatives,  reportedly  in cluding Salvadoran  nationals. The New  York Times reported on April 8, 1984, that  Administration sources stated that unlike  previous activities of the Nicaraguan rebel  forces, monitored  by American  advisers  from Honduras, the mining operations are  under the ""immediate control"" of American  advisers.  These actions resulted from a National Se curity Planning Group meeting in February  1984. On April 9, 1984, Senator Barry Gold water wrote a  letter to William J. Casey  C.I.A. Director, confirming that the mining  operation was  initiated with  the ""written  approval of  the President""  in February,  1984. In Senator Goldwater's words, ""[t]his  is an act violating international law."" While  federal law required the President to ""fully  inform"" congressional intelligence commit tees of operations abroad in a ""timely fash ion,"" many recent statements of members of  the  intelligence committees  indicate  that  they were not appropriately informed of the  covert mining operations.  A spokesman for the C.I.A., Dale Peter sen, refused to confirm or deny the reports  of U.S. participation in the mining of Nica. raguan waters. On Sunday, April 8, 1984,  Secretary of Defense Weinberger refused to  comment on other officials' reports that the  C.I.A. had directed the activities.  On April 8, 1984, the United States noti fied  the United Nations that it was with drawing from the jurisdiction of the World  Court  regarding  any  actions  in Central  America. The Reagan Administration dis avowed World Court jurisdiction over any  disputes ""with any Central American state  or any dispute arising out of or related to  events in Central America."" This was done  in an effort to avoid jurisdiction in the case  filed by the Nicaraguan government seeking  a declaration of the illegality of the United  States government's actions  in Nicaragua  under international law.  Since the United States is not at war with  Nicaragua, the mining operations could be  construed as an illegal blockade. A state of  belligerency in a requisite to a legal block ade under international law.  The British government has advised the  Reagan administration that it disapproves  of the mining operations as a threat to the  freedom of navigation. State Department  officials have conceded that other nations  have also expressed their disapproval of the  mining operations.  The French Foreign Ministry has publicly  stated that the mining of Nicaraguan ports  has already prevented ships carrying ""hu manitarian supplies"" from Europe from un loading their cargoes.  The mining  operations  jeopardize  the  fragile structure of international law that  has been arduously constructed since World  War II.  We believe that the Administration's ac tions are dismaying to all concerned with  the rule of law. Particularly, it appears as if  the conduct aforesaid violates the Neutrali ty Act, 18 USC § 960. The section provides  that: ""Whoever, within the United States,  knowingly begins or sets on foot or provides  or prepares a means for, or furnishes the  money for, or takes part in, any military or  naval expedition or enterprise to be carried  on from thence against the territory or do minion of any foreign prince or state, or of  19425  any colony, district, or people with whom  the United States is at peace, shall be fined  not more  than $3,000 or  imprisoned not  more than three years, or both.""  It further appears that conduct described  above violates Title 18, United States Code,  Section 956,  in that the persons  involved  conspired and agreed to injure or destroy  property  of  the Republic  of Nicaragua,  other Governments and private companies  and individuals, including ocean vessels and  their cargoes.  Said conduct as  reported  indicates that  United States Government officials of ex tremely high rank have provided and are  providing financial, technical and other sup port  to groups of Nicaraguan exiles and  other mercenaries  involved  in mining the  ports of Nicaragua and that United States  Government personnel have provided and  continue  to provide explosives and mines,  instructors,  a mother  ship  from which  mining  operations  are  coordinated  and  other forms of support as yet unknown to  the undersigned. The Neutrality Act prohib its military expeditions or enterprises from  the United States against any country at  peace with  the United States. Wiborg v.  United States, 163 U.S. 632, 647 <1895>; The  Three Friends. 166 U.S. 1, 56 <1896).  The term ""military enterprise"" is not lim ited to official  invasion, but  includes any  type of military enterprise or expedition.  Wiborg v. United States, 163 U.S. 632. The  statute applies to foreign exiles as well as  United States citizens. Charge to the Grand  Jury-Neutrality Laws, 30 F. Cas. 1017, 1018  (C.C.D.N.Y.  1866)  <No.  18,264). The  law  ""brands as an offense against the Govern ment the first effort or proposal by individ uals to get up a military enterprise in this  country against a  foreign one  . . .  [TJhe  first incipient step taken with a view to the  enterprise, by the engaging of men, muni tions of war, [or] means of transportation""  is a violation of the Neutrality Act. United  States v. Ybanez, 53 F. 536, 538 <C.C.W.D.  Tex. 1892).  Training,  enlisting,  contributing  funds,  clothing or provisions furnishing transpor tation, or providing arms,  in  the United  States, are all prohibited by the Act when  undertaken in contemplation of a military  expedition against another country. United  States v. Hughes, 70 F. 972, 976 <E.D.S.C.  1895); United States v. Lumsden, 26 F. Cas.  1013, 1015 <C.C.S.D. Ohio 1856) <No.  641>; United States v. O'Sullivan, 27 Fed.  Cases 367, 377 <S.D.N.Y. 1851> <No. 15,974>;  see also, Note, Nonenforcement of the Neu trality Act: International Law and Foreign  Policy Powers Under the Constitution, 95  Harvard Law Review 1955, 1962-3 <1982).  The history of  the Neutrality Act,  the  statements of its framers and judicial prece dent all show that the Act was intended to  and does apply to all citizens and officers of  the Government no matter what their rank.  In fact, in 1858, in the midst of debate over  private expeditions against Nicaragua, Sena tor Slidell introduced a resolution to amend  the Neutrality Act and permit Presidential  support  for private expeditions. Congres sional Globe, 35th Congress, 1st Session,  January 28,  1858,  pages 461-562, Senate  Report No. 20, January 28, 1858. Senator  Slidell's proposal failed and the Neutrality  Act has remained substantially unamended  to the present time. As stated by Supreme  Court Justice William Patterson  in 1807:  ""The President of the United States cannot  control the [Neutrality Act], nor dispense  with its execution, and still less can he au13,  ",1984
933,816,14,Mr. KEMP.," Mr.  Speaker, David  Brody, the Anti-Defamation League's  talented Washington  representative,  has truly ""arrived'': he has been pro filed in TASS. It is not often that the  propaganda arm of the Soviet Govern ment does an  indepth feature on a  prominent member of the B'nai B'rith.  But it seems that just as the Soviets  have become accustomed  to stealing  Western  technology, so  too do  they  steal news reports. If the TASS wire  service piece on Mr. Brody had a de cided New York flavor to it, that was  because it was a near verbatim transla tion of a New York Times article of a  year ago, with the noticeable addition  of  some original Soviet anti-Zionist  slurs.  ""Washington Talk"" columnists Wil liam  Farrell  and Warren Weaver  called attention to this Soviet imita tion in their article, ""Get Me TASS  Rewrite,"" which I ask be printed in  the RECORD. I also ask that the orginal  New York  Times  feature  on Mr.  Brody, ""An 'Unelected Member' of the  Senate,"" be included as well.  I will leave it to TASS to publish the  Soviet dispatch and in the meantime,  keep up the good work Dave.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  [From the New York Times, May 14, 19841  GET ME TASS REWRITE  <By William E. Farrell and Warren Weaver,  Jr.>  Soviet correspondents, it seems, can also  succumb to the age-old journalistic practice  of rewriting their competitors. In a January  copy of Sovetskaya Moldaviya, a Kishinev  daily, appears a Tass dispatch that bears a  striking resemblance to a profile of David  Brody, Washington lobbyist for  the Anti Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, that ran  on this page a year ago.  The Tass article begins as almost a trans lation of the New York Times article, dis cribing how Mr. Brody is accorded senatori al privileges  in riding the Capitol subway  and elevators. Then phrases that were not  in the original begin appearing; B'nai B'rith  is described as ""completely under the con trol of Zionist circles"" and Mr. Brody as op posing bills ""which do not correspond to the  interests of Tel Aviv 'hawks.'""  A quotation from Mr. Brody, explaining  his position on aid to Israel, is materially al tered. The Times version: ""You can't win  over the Arabs by weakening Israel. If Israel  receives the aid it needs, it's in a better posi tion  to  compromise;  a weakened  Israel  cannot."" The Tass version: ""You will not get  the good will of the Arabs by weakening  Israel. If Tel Aviv receives the assistance it  needs, then the U.S.A. will be in a better po sition.''  After about 400 words, the Russian writer  parts company with the original story alto gether to discuss the impact on Congress of  ""Zionist and pro-Israel organizations"" and  the current volume of United States aid to  Israel. He concludes, entirely on his own,  that ""all the doors and loopholes on Capitol  Hill are open for David Brody; which he  sees in his dreams crowned by the Zionist  symbol, the six-pointed Star of David.""  [From the New York Times, May 26, 19831  AN ""UNELECTED MEMBER"" OF THE SENATE  <By Martin Tolchin)  WASHINGTON, May 25.-""Senators Only""  said the sign in front of the Capitol subway,  but David Brody was waved aboard by Sena tor Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa,  whom he thanked for signing a resolution  opposing the sale of advanced weaponry to  Jordan.  ""Senators Only"" said the sign above the  elevators in the Capitol, but Mr. Brody was  escorted onto  the car by Senator  Jesse  Helms,  Republican  of North  Carolina,  whom he congratulated on North Carolina  State's N.C.A.A. basketball championship.  ""Dave Brody is the unelected member of  the U.S. Senate,"" said Senator Charles McC.  Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland, who  is an old friend.  Mr. Brody, who will be 67 years old next  month,  is a short, kinetic institution who  seems to know just about everyone in Gov ernment. He is the Washington representa tive  of  B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation  League, and, like those of many other lobby ists, his office walls are lined with signed  photographs of Presidents and other White  House notables. ""What would we do without  friends?"" wrote Vice President Bush, and  James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief  of staff, called Mr. Brody ""oftentimes a  strong ally, occasionally a worthy adversary,  but always a friend.''  It is  the Senate, however, where Mr.  Brody presses his campaigns, which focus  on aid to Israel and support of civil rights  legislation. Some other lobbyists for Jewish  June 27, 198.9  organizations consider him a loner because  of his  failure  to coordinate his activities  with  them, and some Capitol Hill people  regard him as overly persistent. But most  consider him effective.  STRATEGY ON AID TO ISRAEL  ""Dave Brody can get in and out of more  senators' offices quicker than any person I  have ever met in my life,"" said former Vice  President Walter F. Mondale.  Mr. Brody's present concerns include the  foreign aid authorizaton bill, which contains  an increase in aid to Israel, and legislation  that would put teeth into a fair housing bill.  On aid to Israel, Mr. Broder tells senators,  ""You can't win over the Arabs by weakening  Israel. If Israel receives the aid it needs, it's  in a better position to compromise; a weak ened Israel cannot.'' On the fair housing bill  be tells them, ""Without effective enforce ment, the bill doesn't mean very much.''  Mr. Brody is a full-service lobbyist. He in troduces senators to constituents, fund-rais ers,  reporters and  ""people  I  think  they  should meet.'' He gives personal advice. He  suggests positions on a wide range of sub jects, including those in which his organiza tion is disinterested.  ""I don't come around only when I need  something,"" Mr. Brody said.""! come around  to chat on a general exchange of views. I  don't  have  a  heavy-handed,  demanding  style.''  OF FRIENDS AND AWACS  ""He's given me valuable advice,"" said Sen ator Howell Heflin, an Alabama Democrat.  ""He has a broad range of interests.""  Mr. Brody doesn't seem to care if a sena tor is a Democrat or Republican, liberal or  conservative. Some of his closet friends  in  the Senate voted for the sale of Awacs to  the Saudis, which Mr. Brody lobbied hard,  and unsucessfully,  to defeat.  ""Somebody  can be against you on one issue, and with  you on the next,"" he said.  His manner can be direct. When Senator  Lloyd Bentsen,  the Texas Democrat,  told  him that Israel needed another Golda Meir,  Mr. Brody replied, ""Senator, if you have the  power to resurrect Golda Meir, that's fine  with me, but Golda Meir also had problems  with our government.  Mr. Brody does considerable entertaining  at home, often bringing senators together  with  the  Israeli Ambassador. Rolf Pauls,  former German Ambassador to Washington,  once quipped that he had seen more sena  tors at Mr. Brody's home  than on  the  Senate floor.  Mr. Brody, a native New Yorker who is a  graduate of City College and Columbia Law  School, came to Washington in 1940 to work  for  the Department of Agriculture,  and  joined the league in 1949. He was promoted  to chief Washington representative in 1965.  His style has evolved over  the decades.  ""Maybe I am a loner,"" he said. ""I have my  own style. You have to be able to relate to  people, even when you find yourself in dis agreement. You have to deal with members  as  individuals, and know what  their con cerns are. I'd have a very narrow range of  friends if we had to agree on every issue.''e  ",1984
934,829,14,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to call  to  the attention of my col leagues the dedication to community  and church of the Reverend Dr. Belvie  H. Jackson, pastor of the Greater Cen tennial A.M.E.  Zionist Church  in  Mount Vernon, NY. Dr. Jackson has  been  endorsed  by  the New York  Annual Conference of Zion as a candi date for bishop  in that church. Dr.  Jackson has devoted his  life  to  the  service of people of all denominations,  as exemplified in recent years in my  home district in Westchester County,  NY.  Now  in his 16th year as pastor at  Greater Centennial, Dr. Jackson still  serves a well organized and full con gregation. He has  led  the effort  to  make Greater Centennial one of the  leading congregations in the New York  metropolitan area. Among the parish's  accomplishments under his direction  are:  the completion of  the Greater  Centennial Homes, a 157 housing unit;  a Federal credit union; the coordina tion of Ebony Economic Enterprizes a group of churches and community  organizations;  the  construction  of  Ebony Gardens, 140 units of middle income housing; and the purchase of a  new bus and parsonage for the church.  Having worked with Dr. Jackson  in  many of these efforts  to better our  community, I can truly say that he is a  man who cares and who accomplishes.  Realizing  that  a  religious  leader  must  also be  an  active  community  leader,  he  is  also  a member of  a  number of local service organizations  in Westchester.  He  is  a  charter  member  of Nimrod Lodge No.  96,  Prince Hall Masons; past grand chap lain of Prince Hall Grand Lodge; a  member  of  the  Mount  Vernon  NAACP; a member and vice president  of the A.M.E. Zion Ministerial Alliance  of Greater New York; chairperson of  the Clergy Committee of  the West chester  Industrialization  Center;  a  member of the Mount Vernon Rotary;  the  past  president  of  the Mount  Vernon Council on Churches; and a  member of the Mount Vernon Police  Advisory Council.  Rev.  Jackson's service however,  is  not limited to his immediate communi ty. He has represented his denomina tion at the World Methodist Council,  and has volunteered his services  to  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  churches in Ghana, Nigeria, Liberia,  South America, Jamaica, London, the  Virgin Islands, and the Bahamas.  The Reverend Jackson is a well-pre pared, stable man. Dedicated  to his  family,  his  church, his  community,  and his nation. He is an activist, an ed ucator, a motivator, inspirer and devel oper, and most of all-a leader. I ask  my colleagues  to  join me  in paying  tribute to this exemplary individuate  IT WAS A NICE WAY TO SAY  THANK YOU  HON. ROY DYSON  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 27, 1984   ",1984
935,829,14,Mr. DYSON.," Mr. Speaker, few areas  in  the world can compare with  the  Eastern Shore of Maryland. Beautiful  waters, mild temperatures, and friend ly people create an environment aptly  called the land of pleasant living. One  of our greatest assets  is clearly  the  people who live on the Eastern Shore.  The land of pleasant living would not  be  so, were  it not  for people  like:  Lemuel H.  ""Bo"" Benton,  Thomas  Ewing,  Albert  Stant,  Bernard  F.  Dadds,  Elmer Kessler,  J. Thomas  Rhodes, and C. Harper Starkey. Re cently, Queen Annes County, MD, rec ognized these outstanding individuals  for their public service to the county.  It has been estimated that the sum  total  of  service  to Queen Annes  County  by  these  seven  individuals  totals 172 years.  Mr. Speaker,  I  proudly  represent  Queen Annes County here in the Con gress.  I  say  proudly  because  this  county publicly thanked these individ uals for this public service. I believe it  is noteworthy to include in the RECORD  today a copy of an editorial which ap peared in the Star Democrat on June  21,  1984.  It  apropriately  applauds  Queen Annes County and its board of  county  commissioners  for  honoring  these public servants.  IT WAs A NrcE WAY To SAY THANK You  Queen Anne's County did a nice thing last  week.  It honored, as  it does annually, a  handful of citizens for outstanding county  service.  There was Lemuel H. ""Bo"" Benton, the  former Queen Anne's County and Sudlers ville Town Commissioner, for instance, who  was cited  for his work on a number of  boards and commissions, including those re lated to criminal justice, recreation and the  elderly.  There was  Thomas Ewing,  owner  of  Holly's Restaurant, who worked with  the  county's election board  for 22 years and  with the Goodwill Fire Co. for 55 years.  There was Queenstown Bank President  Albert Stant, a life member of the Queens town Volunteer Fire Co., who served on the  county's Civil Service Board since its start  in 1967.  And there were four others-Bernard F.  Dadds,  a  volunteer  fireman and election  board member; Elmer Kessler, an election  19451  board member and former bicycle shop op erator; J. Thomas Rhodes, a mailman and  leader in education, 4-H and various good works  clubs;  and C. Harper Starkey,  a  former election official who was the coun ty's tax assessor for 13 years. One county  commissioner said  the seven had given a  total of 172 years service to the county.  What was nice about the awards is that it  was done so publicly and so formally by the  county commission. Of course there can be  all sorts of pitfalls in such events, not the  least of which  is  that  the  awards  can  become something of political price avail able  only  to  county office  holders  and  friends, colleagues and acquaintances of the  politicians who bestow them. Still, it seems  a wonderfully open way to honor those who  have given so much to their various commu nities.  Other counties-or perhaps a major civic  group-might want  to consider  following  the Queen Anne's lead and honoring their  own public servants. What better way to say  thanks?e  TRIBUTE TO TILLAMOOK  CREAMERY ASSOCIATION  HON. LES AuCOIN  OF OREGON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 27, 1984   Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor one of Oregon's oldest  and finest businesses. The Tillamook  County Creamery Association, makers  and distributors of the world famous  Tillamook Cheese  is  currently cele brating their 75th year of operation.  Since its inception, the creamery has  been producing dairy products which  meet rigid in-house standards, subse quently marketing  this now  famous  product nationwide, and making Tilla mook Cheese a near household name.  Since 1894, when a young Canadian  named Peter Mcintosh arrived in Til lamook County, dairy  farmers have  banded  together  to produce a dairy  product that was superior to any other  cheese around. A gold medal at the St.  Louis Worlds Fair in 1904 was the first  of many awards that has helped make  Tillamook Cheese  such a  respected  product. For the past 75 years, with  the assistance of local dairy farmers,  the Tillamook County Creamery Asso ciation has continued to oversee the  cheesemaking process.  Over 100,000 gallons of fresh, whole  milk is received daily at the Tillamook  creamery from over 220  local dairies  which make up the unique cooperative  system  utilized  by  the  creamery.  These  dairymen who  provide  the  creamery with the milk products are  an independent group of hard work ing,  dedicated Oregonians. For  the  most part, these dairymen and women  do not take part in the milk diversion  program  and  operate  their  dairies  without Federal assistance.

936,842,14,Mr. WHEAT.," Mr. Speaker, the Na tion's oldest and largest civil rights or ganization,  the National Association  for  the Advancement  of  Colored  People, is celebrating its 75th year as a  champion in the struggle for freedom  and human rights of all Americans.  In 1909, when the organization was  founded, conditions of black Ameri cans were, at best, dismal and growing  worse by the day. A small, but emi nent, group of citizens from all over  the United States, black and white, re sponded to the call for an end to the  eventual demise and further oppres sion of black Americans and the begin ning of full citizenship rights. On the  centennial of the birth of Abraham  Lincoln,  these  concerned Americans  gathered in New York City to partici pate in a conference which led to the  organization of the NAACP.  Early  organization  aims were  to  create a truly democratic society, a so ciety  in which  racial  injustice wa.S  eliminated and equality of opportunity  was brought within reach. This would  be done peacefully by relying on the  available vehicles of  the press,  the  ballot, and the courts. Therefore the  blueprint for  the proposed organiza tion was designed to cover all areas of  injustice. The early organizers per ceived a  strong  legal department  to  carry  to  the courts case after case  until they were compelled to end sepa,.  rate laws for some, a publicity bureau  to  research  and  publicize  human  atrocities, a political bureau to ensure  representation, a civil rights bureau to  investigate alleged  injustices, and an  industrial bureau  to ""deal with  the  colored man in relation to labor"" and  jobs.  At a time when the Federal Govern ment and the courts offered no relief,  the NAACP had no small task before  it in 1909. In the face of overt and vio lent  racial hostility,  it conducted a  forceful crusade against lynching and  fought to end discrimination and seg regation  in  employment,  industry,  education, voter registration, election  laws,  the  armed  services,  housing,  transportation, accommodations, and  eating establishments.  Over the past 75 years, the NAACP  has  fought many hard  fights, won  major victories, suffered many disap pointments and undergone changes in  structure and leadership. But it sur vived and today remains at the fore front of the continuing 'fight for free dom, dignity,  and equality. Today's  struggle is as great as it was 75 years  ago. As it was then, it is now, not a  black struggle-but a human struggle.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  For as long as one man is in bondage,  so is all of mankind.  According  to  a  Census  Bureau  report, in the 1970's black Americans  suffered  sharp  setbacks  in  employ ment and in the social areas:  The disproportionate impact on blacks of  the economic downturn beginning in 1974  and  of  the  relatively  sluggish  economy  through 1983 effectively brought to a halt  the momentum of overall social and eco nomic improvement apparent of the begin ning of this decade.  Dr. Benjamin Hooks, the executive  director of the NAACP,  in a  recent  statement warned  that we  are  in  danger of losing some rights we have  won if we do not do something about  the high unemployment now sustained  by black Americans.  I join my fellow Americans in a trib ute of  thanks and applause  to  the  NAACP on the occasion of their dia mond jubilee celebration. The status  of black Americans has advanced sig nificantly, and the NAACP can take  pride in its role in achieving that suc cess. But the struggle continues.e  TRIBUTE TO MAJ. GEN. HARRY  W. BROOKS,  JR.  <U.S. ARMY,  RETIRED>  HON. FORTNEY H. (PETE) STARK  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 27, 1984   ",1984
937,842,14,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to bring to the attention of my  colleagues  the  accomplishments  of  Harry W. Brooks, Jr. He was born in  Indianapolis,  IN,  and  entered  the  Army as a teenager. After 29 years of  service, he retired as a major general,  the sixth black American to achieve  this rank.  General Brook's military record  is  exemplary and his decorations include  the  Distinguished  Service  Medal,  Legion of Merit, Bronze Star with Oak  Leaf  Cluster, Meritorious  Service  Medal, Air Medal with six Oak Leaf  Clusters, Korean Order of National  Security, and the Vietnamese Cross of  Gallantry.  Major General Brooks has been just  as active in civilian life and has earned  additional honors. These include the  Kiwanis  International Distinguished  Service  Award,  NAACP  Freedom  Award, NAACP Meritorious Service  Award, Pittsburg Courier Top Hat  Award for Outstanding Civic Achieve ments, and. the 1982 Public Relations  New Gold Key Award. He  is a 33d  degree Mason and a Shriner. General  Brook's contributions to his communi ty are exceptional too. He has served  as a director of the chamber of com merce  in Hawaii,  a member of  the  Aloha Council Boy Scouts Executive  Board. Additionally, he was on  the  board of trustees, Gannett Newspaper  Foundation, and he is a member of the  June 27, 1981;  U.S.  Hawaii  Advisory  Committee,  Commission on Civil Rights.  On July 13, Californians will honor  General Brooks with a dinner at the  Oakland Hilton Hotel. Proceeds from  the  dinner will  benefit California  Impact, a youth training and employ ment program. It is fitting that Gener al Brooks is associated with this orga nization as his  life provides a  role  model for youth. Through education,  perseverance,  and  dedication, Maj.  Gen. Harry W. Brooks, Jr., has distin guished himself personally and profes sionally.  I  join his friends and colleagues in  congratulating him on a job well done  and in sending best wishes for every  future success.e  PREVENTION OF NUCLEAR WAR  HON. JAMES M. SHANNON  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 27, 1984[  e ",1984
938,842,14,Mr. SHANNON.," Mr. Speaker,  the  principal  challenge  confronting hu manity today is the prevention of nu clear war. Unless we can stop the re lentless accumulation of nuclear weap ons, refute the mad doctrine of fight ing and winning a nuclear war, return  to  arms  control  negotiations  and  agreements, and reduce the risk of war  by accident or misjudgment, we will  have no world to pass on to our chil dren. This issue supersedes all others.  I am extremely dissatisfied with this  administration's feeble record on arms  control issues. Where the previous six  Presidents have produced arms control  agreements,  from Eisenhower's 1959  Antarctic Treaty  to Kennedy's 1963  Limited Test Ban Treaty to Johnson's  1968  Non-Proliferation  Treaty  to  Nixon's  197 4 Threshold Test Ban  Treaty to Ford's 1976 Peaceful Nucle ar Explosions Treaty to Carter's SALT  II Offensive Arms Treaty, this Presi dent has produced absolutely nothing.  Indeed, he is on record as having never  supported  a  nuclear  arms  control  agreement.  is  no great  surprise,  then, to learn that the START talks  have stopped, the INF talks are in in definite recess,  the President has re fused  to  resume comprehensive  test  ban negotiations, and SALT II remains  in limbo. The situation is dismal.  Given  the gravity of our predica ment, I am today introducing the secu rity and general disarmament resolu tion, a package of legislative initiatives  that will pull us back from the brink  of nuclear confrontation and  revive  the arms control process. These meas ures, taken in conjunction with a com prehensive,  bilateral nuclear  freeze,  offer hope for ending this arms race  and  restoring peace and security  to  the Nation.

939,855,14,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, the  Falasha Jews have a long, a tragic his tory  in Ethiopia, and have endured  persecution, poverty,  and  slaughter.  The very name ""Falasha"" reflects how  the non-Jewish populace feel  toward  the black Jews of Ethiopia.  In  the  native Ethiopian  language  Falasha  means ""stranger"" or ""intruder,"" de spite the fact that the Falashas have  been in the region 3,000 years. The Fa lashas themselves prefer to be called  Beta Israel, or of the house of Israel.  Before the 17th century, the Fala shas were rulers of an extensive sec tion of Ethiopia. Prolonged warfare  among Christian, Muslim, and Jewish  kings of Ethiopia took its toll on the  Falashas. One Christian king  even  called himself ""The Exterminator"" of  the Jews. The Falashas became defeat ed  and  isolated.  Thousands were  killed. All Falashas were forbidden to  own  land,  and  large numbers were  made  to work  as  tenant  farmers.  Others were forced to become artisans,  and since many Ethiopians look upon  artisans  as  sorcerers,  the Falashas  were feared and hated.  Conservative estimates number the  Falasha population of the 19th centu ry at a quarter of a million. At the  turn  of  this  century  there were  100,000. Those killed were victims of  torture and annihilation. Nearly 7,000  lost  their  lives during  the Marxist  takeover  in  1974, when  the  Jews  became trapped between revolutionary  and counter-revolutionary crossfire. In  ",1984
940,868,14,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President,  I  join Senator BAKER today in congratu lating the new foundation in Canada  upon its creation and the purpose it  recognizes-the coordination of gov ernment and private efforts to restore,  maintain, and protect Canada's wet lands and the wildlife inhabitants that  it shares with the United States.  This year has been a hallmark year  for the recognition of the importance  of efforts  in  this country  to secure  wildlife refuges.  1984 is the 50th anniversary of our  Duck Stamp, the sale of which has se cured 3.5 million acres of wetlands and  wildlife habitats in the United States.  The establishment of Wildlife Habitat  Canada this year underscores Canadi an interest in our mutual concern for  preservation.  Both countries have suffered severe  losses of wetlands, and I'm encouraged  to see us both making efforts to re verse that trend.  I wish for the foundation much suc cess in its efforts to protect essential  wildlife habitat.  ",1984
941,868,14,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President,  it  is  with great pride that I join my distin guished  colleagues, Senators BAKER  and CocHRAN,  in paying  a well-de served tribute to the wildlife preserva tion efforts of our Canadian neigh bors.  In recognizing the great importance  of maintaining  their national wet lands, the Canadian Government has  chartered this nonprofit corporation:  Wildlife Habitat Canada. The organi zation promises to encourage both gov ernment and private sector interests to  join in the campaign for the protec tion of wetland areas. Such positive ac tions by  the Canadian Government,  along with others like the Ducks Un limited reception hosted by Canadian  Ambassador Allan Gottleib which  I  had the pleasure of attending, have  made clear their commitment to the  protection of wildlife habitat. In the  past, initiatives in this area have, as  Senator BAKER pointed out, been the  concern of  the private sector. Now,  due  to  the Canadian Government's  novel effort, this safeguarding of wild life habitat will be, not only a private  interest, but also a national priority.  Once again, Mr. President,  I  con gratulate both the Canadian Govern ment and Wildlife Habitat Canada for  their impressive efforts in the name of  wetland and wilderness protection.    RETIREMENT  OF  VICE  ADM.  EUGENE  A.  GRINSTEAD,  SUPPLY CORPS, U.S. NAVY  ",1984
942,868,14,Mr. STENNIS.," Mr. President, I want  to pay tribute today to one of the Na tion's top uniformed logistics experts,  Vice  Adm.  Eugene  A.  Grinstead,  Supply Corps, U.S. Navy, who is retir ing after 41 years of dedicated service.  Since 1981 he has been Director of the  Defense Logistics Agency which has  its headquarters in Alexandria, VA.  Starting as a student and midship man  in  the Naval Reserve, Admiral  Grinstead was  initially trained as an  underwater  demolition  officer.  In  1946, however, he joined the Supply  Corps and transferred to the Regular  Navy. Since that time he has worked  in logistics positions of increasing re sponsibility,  spending much  of  his  time in supply billets associated with  naval  aviation.  In March 1977,  he  became Commander, Naval  Supply  Systems Command and 33d Chief of  the Supply Corps. From that position  he moved on to become the seventh  Director  of  the Defense  Logistics  Agency.  As Director of DLA, which acquires  and distributes more than 2.2 million  consumable items for all of the armed  services,  Admiral  Grinstead  has  stressed programs designed to improve  availability of supplies and services to  men and women in uniform. Operating  a worldwide network of supply and  service  installations at several hun dred sites around the world, he has  been in charge of some 50,000 employ ees-most of them civilians.  Under his leadership DLA has, for  example, developed programs to pro vide intensive management to critical  parts for more than 500 weapon sys tems.  It has  perfected  systems  to  supply  needed  nonstocked medical  equipment by air for U.S. hospitals in  Europe and Asia. His overriding goal  has been to make DLA a more effec tive support agency  for his military  ""customers.""  President Reagan  has  nominated  and the Senate has confirmed Admiral  Grinstead's retirement as a Vice Admi ral-the rank he has held as Director,  Defense  Logistics  Agency-a  rank  which is seldom attained in the Navy  Supply Corps. As he steps into that  well-deserved  retirement,  our  good  wishes go with him.  IN MEMORY OF LEENDERT  BINNENDIJK  ",1984

951,907,14,Mr. HATCH.," I think it is outrageous  that these people have not cooperated  with  the Appropriations Committee.  There has been nobody more  con cerned about the Legal Services Cor poration or about the problems it has  raised through the years or about the  excesses it has gone through, who has  done more to show those excesses and  those problems.  I  am  convinced  that  the  distin guished Senator from New Hampshire  and  others  on  the Appropriations  Committee are working with us  to  make sure that this corporate board  has the flexibility to be able to func tion as a corporate board. In fact, we  are going to have a colloquy that will  resolve most of the problems.  What I am concerned about, I want  to  tell my dear  friend  from North  Carolina, is we have put a lot of re forms into this appropriations bill. We  did it last year. It is the first time we  have really gotten together, those who  are ardent supporters of  the Legal  Services Corporation and  those who  are not.  I can tell the Senator those reforms  are absolutely crucial.  One of  the big problems we have  had, I bring to the attention of my  dear friend  from North Carolina,  is  that  the board has not really been  able to function as a support. We had  almost all of the board members come  before our committee, which is a very  complex  and divisive  committee on  this issue, very much in disagreement  with each other. All but two came out  unanimously by a vote of the commit tee.  We have had all of these people held  up during their period of time, and I  think that is ridiculous, too.  I appreciate the problems that the  distinguished  Senator  from North  Carolina and others have had with  this  corporation.  I  think we  have  brought out point after point after  point as to how this corporation really  has been run in the past and the ex cesses it has subscribed to and actually  implemented.  My concern  is  that the confirmed  board, and I call the attention of the  distinguished  Senator  from  New  Hampshire to this point, will have the  freedom to make the funding decisions  that previous boards have made. I be lieve  they will make  adequate and  good decisions. I believe there is really  no contest with regard to 9 out of the  11 board members. I think we ought to  get as many of those board members  through as we can, and then we ought  the  two  them  and get  to  take on  through.  That is all I am saying. I ask my dis tinguished friend to comment on this.  Of course, I agree to have our colloquy  for the RECORD that will clarify a lot  of the problems that our friend from  North Carolina has had.  ",1984

954,907,14,Mr.  HELMS.,  These  nominations  were reported out 9 months ago?  ,1984
955,907,14,Mr. HATCH.," No, this year. Several  weeks ago. None of  them came out  unanimously from the committee. We  have had nothing but problems.  ",1984
956,907,14,Mr. HELMS., Will  the Senator de scribe  for  the Senator  from North  Carolina what  is going on with the  holdup of these nominations?  ,1984
957,907,14,Mr. HATCH., I cannot describe it. All  I can say is there are certain people  who have put holds on these nomi nees. I think it will be incumbent on  the majority leader to call up those  nominations and  resolve  the  issues.  None will go through quickly.  ,1984
958,907,14,Mr. HELMS.," Perhaps it will be well  for the RECORD if one or the other of  the  Senators  would  indicate  the  present composition of the board, how  many members, how many vacancies,  and so forth.  ",1984
959,907,14,Mr. HATCH.," There are only four  members on  the board, as  I under stand it, and they are recess appoint ments.  ",1984
960,907,14,Mr. RUDMAN.,  I believe  there are  five with six vacancies. The five are  recess appointments.  ,1984
961,907,14,Mr. HELMS., I see.  ,1984
962,907,14,Mr. HATCH., And  they have been  that way for well over a year. So the  point of  the distinguished Senator  from North Carolina is well taken.  ,1984
963,907,14,Mr. RUDMAN.," Nobody would be  more pleased than the Senator from  New Hampshire to see this board con firmed and let them run Legal Serv ices Corporation. The point  that  I  made earlier, and I have great respect  for the Senator from North Carolina,  is the Senator from North Carolina is  precisely correct in what he said about  this being legislation on an appropria tions bill. But there are times in life  when you have  to do  the practical  thing. Were we not to put language in  this appropriations bill we would have  an uncontrolled situation in the Legal  Services Corporation. Hopefully we  can get these 9 or 11 people confirmed  and be off to something more impor tant.  .  ",1984

965,907,14,Mr. RUDMAN., I yield.  ,1984
966,907,14,Mr. HATCH., Without this language  in this bill we can lose the reforms we  have actually worked on and which I  think everybody is proud are in this  bill. I think the distinguished Senator  from New Hampshire has done a tremendous job in working with us to try  to resolve these problems. I believe our  colloquy will resolve further problems  that exist. I just call upon my friend  to assert strongly that once the board  is confirmed it will have the complete  power to operate as prior boards.  ,1984
967,907,14,Mr. RUDMAN., Subject to those pro visions that the Senator is aware of.  ,1984
968,907,14,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I have  several questions concerning the por tion of H.R. 5712 that provides appro priations for the Legal Services Corpo ration. I would like to address these  questions  to my  distinguished  col league from New Hampshire, who has  worked so diligently on this bill and  has seen to it that the bill has moved  quickly  through  the Appropriations  Committee.  I want again  to express  my gratitude for the courtesy and co operation that he has shown my staff  and me, as we have attempted to ad dress  the controversial and complex  issues surrounding the Corporation.  My  first  question  to my distin guished colleague concerns  language  in the report which states as follows:  This appropriation provides an 8.2-percent  increase for all non-census-based field posi tions <field programs or components there of, whose funding levels are not based on  the  poverty  population within  the geo graphical area they serve), national support  <including  the clearinghouse), State sup port,  special programs, and  the  regional  training centers.  My questions are these: If a Board is  confirmed by the Senate, would they  be bound to provide an increase to all  Corporation programs and activities or  would  they be free  to determine, as  previous Boards have done, who  to  fund and at what level? Would they be  free, for example, to move money from  a national support activity over to the  direct delivery of legal aid? Perhaps  stated more broadly, how do the pro gramming procedures work and how  do they interact with the report lan guage adopted by the committee?  ",1984
969,907,14,Mr. RUDMAN.," To address the ques tions in reverse order, the manner in  which the reprogramming procedure  works  is  thoroughly  explained  on  pages 87 and 88 of  the committee's  report on this bill <S. Rept. 98-514). It  is basically a ""report and wait"" provi sion under which  an  agency must  inform the House and Senate Appro priations Committees of any changes  they wish  to make in their congres sionally approved budgets and give the  two  committees  the opportunity  to  comment  thereon.  The  provision  works to the advantage of the agencies  involved since they retain the ability  to respond to unforeseen or changing  circumstances.  The alternative would be for Con gress  to enact  into  law a budget  in  such detail that agencies would have  no flexibility over the course of the  fiscal year. I should note that the re programming provision has been law  ",1984

This amend ment  incorporates  the substance of  legislation  recently  reported by  the  Committee on the Judiciary, S. 1578,  which addresses the issue of local gov ernment antitrust liability.  Mr. President, the pending amend ment does two things. First, it provides  that local government units may not  be sued for damages, either single or  treble, under the Clayton Act. Injunc tive  relief under section 16  of  the  Clayton Act, however, could still be  obtained  against  local governments.  Second, the amendment sets forth the  conditions under which private par ties, acting pursuant to the direction  of general function local government  units, may claim immunity from anti trust damage suits. If the criteria of  subsection l(a) of the bill are met, pri vate parties may be sued for injunctive  relief only. If the criteria are not met,  private parties may still be subject to  treble damage actions.  This legislation is the result of over  2 years of study by the Judiciary Com mittee  regarding  the application of  the Federal antitrust laws to local gov ernments. Since the Supreme Court's  decision  in Community Communica tions Co.,  Inc., v. City of Boulder, 455  the  U.S. 40 0982), there has been great  concern among local government offi cials over the uncertain antitrust liability they face.  .  Mr. President,  this amendment  is  not a complete solution to the com plex dilemma now facing local govern ments regarding the antitrust laws. I  am satisfied, however,  that at  this  time it is a solid, responsible approach.  ",1984
974,933,14,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, I shall  be very brief.  I see my friend from  Washington  is here.  I  am going  to  yield to him in just a moment.  Let me simply say that the Senator  from South Carolina  has  outlined  some activities on the part of certain  members of the Federal Trade Com mission, which, from what he says, are  probably  improper. That  does  not  mean that the issues that they were  attempting to influence people about  were improper or bad. It means that  some people over  there have  some  pretty poor judgment.  I just want to say that we now have  in the Judiciary Committee bill on the  Boulder case, given these cities, if this  gets through the Congress, the free dom not  to worry  about damages.  That  is what  they were  concerned  about,  treble  damages. We  believe,  unless we adopt this amendment, the  right of Federal agencies to impose in junctive acts, if it is necessary, exists.  The most  important  point  that  ought to be in this record, that nobody  ought to overlook,  is  that the State  legislature-!  shall  say  once more  under the Boulder case~the State leg islature may,  by  a  simple  action,  confer total immunity-total immuni ty-on any and all of its municipalities  and political subdivisions.  Therefore, it seems to me that what  we have with the Hollings amendment  is,  to some extent, an intrusion into  the rights of the FTC and the Depart ment of Justice as they exist under  law. What we  have done with  the  Thurmond amendment is take care of  the precise problem that the National  League of Cities has been concerned  about; that is, treble damages.  Finally, if they are really concerned  about it, let their legislatures, as the  Louisiana  legislature  recently did,  I  understand,  pass  immunity.  Then  there will be no  jurisdiction whatso ever.  I yield the floor.  ",1984
975,933,14,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President,  I  yield myself just a second just to cor rect the record.  This is only an annual appropriation  bill. This is not total immunity by any  manner or means. Congress is going to  have to work its will on this particular  score, and I hope it will. I hope it will  come through the Judiciary Commit tee.  As my colleagues know, the disposi tion of this Senator is, I hope it will  give total immunity.  But it is not the Federal Trade Com mission as it exists under the law, Mr.  President,  it  is  the Federal Trade  Commission as it exists under outlaw.  I yield the floor.  ",1984
976,933,14,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, I have  listened both with pleasure and with  increasing outrage to the statements  of  the  distinguished Senator  from  South Carolina about lobbying on the   part of members of the Federal Trade  Commission with respect to this legis lation.  I am, however,  in agreement  with  the Senator from New Hamp shire  that our  vote  on  this  issue  should be on our view on the policy  issue and not the lobbying practices of  the Federal Trade Commission.  I address a question the answer to  which can come from either the Sena tor from New Hampshire or the Sena tor  from South Carolina about  the  substantive nature of what we . are  going to vote on. This question arises  out of a  true-life, a hands-on experi ence of the largest community in the  State of Washington with the deregu lation of taxicab services.  I suppose, in distinction to the earli er speech by the Senator from Ohio  this afternoon about the ill effects of  monopoly, that this may well be a per fect example of the ill effects of unre strained  competition  in  a  field  in  which competition does not work very  well.  A year or two ago, the city of Seat tle, King County, W A,  deregulated  taxicab service, both from the point of  view of those who could provide the  service and with  respect  to price.  I  may say to both of the Senators who  are managing this bill that that exper iment turned out to be an unmitigated  disaster. Very rarely do customers of  taxicabs lean into the cab when they  have gotten one to determine what the  price of the ride  is going to be and  whether  there may be  competitive  service available. We had, I suppose, a  few people who live in the community  but far more tourists and students and  the like take taxicabs from Seattle to  the airport, only  to  find  themselves  charged $50, or $75, or $100 for that  service,  thereafter  to  be  told  that  there was no governmental regulation  of those fares and it is too bad that  they were not aware of that proposi tion. They were simply subjected  to  those charges.  In other words, an experiment in a  field like this, to which the American  people have become  accustomed  to  regulation, an experiment with total  deregulation-at least with respect to  fares-in my view, in our community,  which is probably typical of medium  to large cities in the country, was a  complete failure. Whether it would be  a failure with respect to entry into the  taxicab business-that is  to say, who  can drive  taxis under what circum stances and so on-I cannot say. My  own inclination is to believe that com petition in that respect may well be a  good idea.  May I ask either of the managing  Senators, first, what is the scope and  the thrust of the Federal Trade Commission  investigation  which  this  amendment seeks to subvert? Is it gen eral or has it been aimed only at entry  or only at fares and the like?  Second,  is  the amendment of  the  Senator from South Carolina directed  at taking the Federal Trade Commis sion out of everything relating to the  regulation of local taxis?  ",1984
977,933,14,Mr. HOLLINGS.," The answer is yes,  generally, on the first question; and  everything, positively, on the second  part of the question.  ",1984
978,933,14,Mr. GORTON.," If the Senator will  yield, is it the position of the Federal  Trade Commission, to the best of his  knowledge,  that  local  governments  should not be permitted to control the  fare structure of local taxi services?  ",1984
979,933,14,Mr. HOLLINGS.," That is right, Mr.  President. The Federal Trade Commis sion feels that it has and it is a split  decision, three to two.  ",1984
980,933,14,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President,  the  Senator is correct. I just want to put  one caveat to my friend from Wash ington. What the FTC is talking about  is the right of setting rate floors. That  is quite different from the whole ques tion of regulated rates. To set rate  floors is what they are particularly in terested in because of what that im plies  in  terms  of  the  competitive  market. So I do think there is some  implication of the scope.  ",1984
981,933,14,Mr. GORTON.," The Federal Trade  Commission, I ask my friend from New  Hampshire, has no objection  to  the  setting of rate ceilings?  ",1984
982,933,14,Mr. RUDMAN., I believe the Senator  is correct.  ,1984
983,933,14,Mr. GORTON., Does  the Senator  from South Carolina agree with that?  <Mr. ARMSTRONG  assumed  the  chair.>  ,1984
984,933,14,Mr. HOLLINGS.," I do not agree with  that, Mr. President. I believe it is fun damental, with our President, Ronald  Reagan,  to get  the Government off  the backs of the people of America,  and more particularly, the bureaucra cy-unelected, unaccountable  to any  constituency-off the backs of the city  mayors who are elected and do have a  constituency and are accountable. All  of these problems, whether you try to  particularize as to fares, to routes, to  monopoly-all of  that comes out  in  these  local  elections  and  the  local  people are best to control their own  local affairs. That is what this amend ment does.  I did not even want to get into the  merits of it. I have a big file in here to  argue the specific taxi case that I got  from  the Federal Trade Commission  because they have had some hearings.  I think that is what is really the mis take of this particular venture: Here  we in Washington, now, are going to  take on,  in whatever community the  FTC has in mind-can you see us sit ting around up here, particularly the  Federal Trade Commission with  its  ",1984
985,946,14,Mr. RUDMAN.," Mr. President, we  had several votes  in the committee,  and those votes, although close, clear ly were in favor of keeping this pro gram.  I voted with my  friend  from  South Carolina and my friend from  Connecticut in voting against this pro gram.  I had intended at this point to offer  a  second-degree  amendment which  would have had the effect of striking  the money  for  the political parties  from this appropriation and thus re ducing  it by approximately $10 mil lion; because, frankly, I think that to  put Federal money, from the Federal  Treasury, paid by taxpayers, into the  coffers of the two great American po litical parties,  for any reason,  is an  outrage.  But after hearing the debate here, it  seems to me, as one of the two manag ers of this bill, that rather than have  an amendment which may not be sig nificant in terms of expressions of the  will of the Senate, the Senate should  have an opportunity to vote on the  amendment offered by  the Senator  from Connecticut.  I frankly am undecided how I will  vote on that, because I think there are  some things in this program that have  some merit,  the excellent arguments  heretofore notwithstanding.  Nonetheless, I  know  the Senator  from Utah wishes to address the issue.  He is a very distinguished member of  that board and has a different per spective, and I believe I will withhold  from  offering  that  second-degree  amendment,  unless  someone  else  should offer one. We should  in my  view have the opportunity of voting  up or down on the Weicker amend ment. If that should fail, I then intend  to offer an amendment.  ",1984
986,946,14,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, will  the Senator yield for one point?  ",1984
987,946,14,Mr. RUDMAN., I yield.  ,1984
988,946,14,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, my  staff just brought a note that the Am bassadors are being taken to the con vention with private funds.  I only quoted what the NED staffs  were telling me. If that was in error, I  apologize. I just do not know what the  true facts are.  I was  told just the evening before  last that that was the program that  they had. I do not know for what they  have been spending the $18 million,  and I do not want to reflect on the  Ambassadors.  This note says the Ambassadors are  taken  to  the convention on private  funds.  I do not know what the case is, but I  put that in the RECORD at this time.  ",1984
989,946,14,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I par ticularly appreciate  the graciousness  of  the  distinguished Senator  from  South Carolina in correcting his state ment because one of the reasons we es tablished the National Endowment for  Democracy, with a Board of Directors,  is  to debate  in that Board whether  sending people to the national conven tions is right or wrong. Those two par ticular  items were  debated  in  the  Board of Directors, and, as I recall, we  refused to allow that to occur. As a  matter of fact, we rejected and criti cized  rather  abruptly  and  rather  strongly the proposals of one of the  party institutes and limited the total  amount of money for both of the two  political party institutes.  So I particularly appreciate the com ments of  the distinguished Senator  correcting  that particular matter.  I  agree with the Senator. If that is what  we are going to use the National En dowment for Democracy for,  then I  myself would have difficulty support ing it.  That  is why we have  the Board.  That is why I am happy to serve on  that Board.  I assure my colleagues here that as  long as I serve on the Board of the Na tional  Endowment  for Democracy,  those funds are going to be utilized in  the best possible way to encourage the  exportation of democracy all over the  world.  Now, we have had a  lot of humor  here today, and I admit I enjoyed it a  great deal myself. As far as the class  act on this floor,  I  think the distin guished Senator from South Carolina  is as good as anyone. He is one of the  people I most admire in this body.  But I want to talk a little bit about  some of the realities. I want to chat  just a  little bit with my colleagues  about some real considerations. I wish  to chat about why $31 million is not  enough but, nevertheless, that is what  we decided to put into this matter and  we decided when we did that to give  this National Endowment for Democ racy a chance.  Let me reflect back to a time before  the National Endowment for Democ racy came into being. I happen to have  been all over  the world  looking at  what the AFL-CIO trade union insti tutes have been doing.  At first, I was very skeptical of the  work that they were doing. But as I  have gone all over the world, I find  that they are one of the most aggres sive, decent, democratically instituted  and democratically-oriented organizations in the world.    Let me  just give  one  illustration  where they played a particularly noble  role in protecting our country's inter ests in doing what needed to be done  in saving embarrassment to this coun try's foreign policy in exporting demo cratic  principles,  in  convincing  the  world that they have something to add  and something to contribute.  This is not some fairy tale that we  can conjure up as we talk about spend ing too much money around here. This  actually happened. The reason I know  so much about it is that I participated  in it. It happened to be last year, when  the Arab nations decided to embarrass  Israel at the International Labor Or ganization's  annual  conference  in  Geneva, Switzerland. I might mention  that  that organization  is  not very  highly thought of here. Nobody knows  what goes on at the ILO except those  who are experts in the field. But in  the rest of the world, it is one of the  most important entities in all of the  world and  the  largest U.N.-affiliated  organization.  Every year, there are a number of  meetings by the International Labor  Organization which make a lot of dif ference throughout this world. I might  add it is the only organization that I  know of that enjoys tripartite repre sentation. They have government rep resentatives at this organization, labor  representatives, and  they have busi ness  representatives. And  they have  them from all over the world.  The Arab nations decided, for right  or wrong-and I believe wronglyto  embarrass Israel, and so they brought  a  resolution  to  the  International  Labor Organization  that was widely  reported; and had it passed, it would  ",1984
990,972,14,Mr. BIDEN., If the Senator would  yield; we  could probably  spread  it  here.  ,1984
991,972,14,Mr. HOLLINGS., That is correct.  ,1984
992,972,14,Mr. BIDEN., But the other party has  all the money.  ,1984
993,972,14,Mr. BIDEN., That is why we do not  have any. That is why I cannot be too  sympathetic about contributions.  ,1984
994,972,14,Mr. HOLLINGS.," We  just  closed  down resolutions, and everything else.  You will not find a resolution. But if  you want to dissolve  the Republican  and Democratic Parties, bring that up  as a resolution, and say, ""Let us spend  the millions of dollars of contributions  to the political parties to run around  the world on the hotel tour."" As the  Senator from New Hampshire pointed  out, to travel around the world, sit in  these  exotic places,  eat,  catch  the  gout-the nearest thing to it is the law  of the sea conference. We never could  adjourn. We never could agree because  all of these chieftains and heads of  States would meet  in Geneva. We  would sit, burp, and eat. We never  would agree. [Laughter.]  I have been a member of that. We  never would agree. They loved these  kinds of things. This is one magnifi cent  boondoggle,  and  the Senator  from New Hampshire has described it.  I hope we can reallocate these funds  to the student exchanges which have  worked.  The Soviets know what is working.  They have some 12,478 out of Central  America. We have less than 500. We  are behind the eight ball. We ought to  catch up on  these exchanges. Then  you could get the heads of states, like  our friend Nicky Balatti who is now  the President of Panama, who went to  N.C. State. That is the way to spread  democracy in a realistic way, but not  with a hotel-restaurant eating contest.  ",1984
995,972,14,Mr. MITCHELL.," Madam President,  last September I expressed my support  for the National Endowment for De mocracy and my hope that it would be  constituted so as to include the politi cal party  institutes. My support for  these institutes results from the suc cess which similar organizations have  met in the Federal Republic of Ger many. These institutes have operated  for almost 20 years and have bolstered  international debate on a variety of  vital issues. Venezuelan party foundations have achieved similar successes  in Latin America.  As my colleagues are aware, the Na tional Endowment for Democracy was  authorized  in  the  fiscal  year  1984  State Department authorization legis lation, but by the time appropriations  legislation reached the President, only  $18 million was allotted to the endow ment. No specific appropriations were  approved for the National Democratic  and National Republican Institutes of  International Affairs.  While I continue to support giving  the National Endowment for Democ racy  an  opportunity  to  prove  its  worth, and while I hope that a formal  role for  the party  institutes will be  possible at some point in the future, I  will oppose earmarking $5 million for  each  institute  in  the pending  fiscal  year 1985 State-Justice-Commerce ap propriations bill. I base my opposition  on a pledge I made earlier this year:  To oppose  to  the maximum extent  possible new spending  in fiscal year  1985  because  the Federal deficit  is  simply too large. This bill proposes to  appropriate $31 million for the endow ment this year, a  large increase over  last year. As much as I support the  concept of  the endowment I cannot  support such an  increase. Until we  make greater strides in reducing this  deficit, we  cannot  justify approving  new spending except in the most ex ceptional, emergency circumstances.  Thank you, Madam President.  ",1984

1005,985,14,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, I would  remind the Senator from South Caro lina that the last tobacco legislation  that passed this Senate passed by the  widest margin in 10 years.  I do not know where the Senator got  his figures about the imports and ex ports of tobacco, but I have the whole  9 yards if the Senator is interested.  For the 5-year average  from 1976  until 1981 relating to tobacco, per year  the U.S. imports of tobacco from Bul garia-and remember, they produce to bacco over there, too-were $17.7 mil lion. We exported to Bulgaria $1.8 mil lion.  So  I  am not worried  about  any  recoil, if the Senator will forgive me, I  say to the distinguished Senator from  South Carolina.  In 1981, the United States imported.  $18.2 million worth and exported to  Bulgaria $9.8 million.  In 1982, the United States imported  $17.6 million worth and exported $6.9  million. Some recoil,  I would say to  the Senator.  In 1983, the United States imported  $25.8 million worth of  tobacco from  Bulgaria and exported $13.4 million.  I would point out further to the Sen ator  that  this amendment does not  stop private sector trade.  For the rest of the Senator's argu ment, he can say he is against terror ism all he wants to. I am sure he is. I  know  this Senator  is. We can  talk  about being against it, but when you  come to the push and shove of it, you  find a lot of people flaking out.  I yield the floor.  Mr. CHAFFEE addressed the Chair.  ",1984

I  cannot call the Department of Com merce now and get a better figure, but  I am using your Department's figures  there. I am not trying to mislead.  We will let the RECORD show about  the close votes. We have been hus tling. On the last vote, yes, if you can  get an agreement, and if we get an  agreement on  the  labeling bill and  pass that, we will pass it overwhelm ingly.  But when it comes down to the close  votes, that is why we yielded on the  so-called labels, because we cannot get  the votes. That is why CHARLIE RosE  and those on the other side work hand  in glove with us. We try to get the best  we can under the circumstances. The  RECORD Will verify that.  ",1984
1010,998,14,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, I would  just like to address three brief com ments to the floor ma!lager of the bill.  I sympathize with his problem. It is  now close to 11 p.m., and we ought to  have final passage immediately on this  bill.  First, I would just like to ask: 'How  were other  locations selected? They  were not  selected by  a  study, but  rather by discretionary action taken  by the Committee on Appropriations.  Second, the Senate report language  dealing with ocean service centers dif fers from the House language in only  two respects. It added Charleston, SC,  and Rosemont, IL, as sites for a re gional ocean service center.  Third, I have tremendous respect for  the committee's judgment on  these  matters. If the Great Lakes site is to  be chosen by study, then why should  not all of the ocean service sites be  chosen by study? We have not done  that up to now, and I believe there is  no need to do  it in the present  in stance.  The ocean service center concept is  designed to aid the shipping industry  by  providing  comprehensive marine  weather forecasting for shippers oper ating in our coastal waters. Perhaps  the greatest need  for one of  these  ocean service centers exists along the  Nation's  fourth  coast-the  Great  Lakes.  The Great Lakes are like an ocean in  many ways-except in its weather sys tems, which are violent and unpredict able. Weather in the Great Lakes can  be severe and systems can change sud denly, sometimes in a matter of min utes. We  need only  remember  the  sinking of the iron ore ship, Edmund  Fitzgerald, which went down in heavy  seas in Lake Superior. The Edmund  Fitzgerald was a very large ship. Be as sured,  then,  that  those waves were  very large. Our goal in establishing an  ocean  service  center  in  the Great  Lakes  is  to prevent another tragedy  like that of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  At present,  there is no centralized  marine weather forecast station in the  Great Lakes. Forecasting  is done at  four Great Lakes forecast centers in  Buffalo, Cleveland, Ann Arbor, and  Rosemont,  IL, near Chicago. While  the National Weather Service person nel at these sites have done a great  job, there is still a great need for one  site with  a  dedicated  force  giving  Great Lakes marine forecasting their  primary attention.  The Senate Subcommittee on State,  Justice, Commerce Appropriations has  provided $6.5 million for the establish ment of seven regional ocean service  centers for the fiscal year 1985. The  committee has directed that the ocean  service center for the Great Lakes be  located  at  the  existing  National  Weather Service station at Rosemont,  IL.  I strongly support the ocean service  center concept and I ask my colleagues  to endorse this item as marked up by  the Senate Appropriations Subcom mittee. As for the Great Lakes center,  there  is no doubt  in my mind that  Rosemont, IL, is the best place to put  this station. I say this not because of  my position as an Illinois Senator, but  because of the realities of the situa tion in the Great Lakes.  Mr. President, the National Weather  Service station at Rosemont currently  handles all  the  forecasting  for  the  State of Illinois. The fine staff there  also maintain and operate the sophis ticated weather forcasting systems at  O'Hare International Airport in Chica go, which is the Nation's busiest air port.  The Rosemont center and staff are  uniquely qualified to handle the duties  of  the Great Lakes Ocean Service  Center for a number of reasons. First,  when the Rosemont station was locat ed in downtown Chicago, it was known  as the Chicago District Forecast Sta tion. That station did all the forecast ing for all the Great Lakes before the  present system of four stations was  implemented  in  the 1970's. In  fact,  some of the same meteorological staff  who were with the office then are still  at  the Rosemont  station now,  and  could draw on their vast experience of  lakes forecasting when the ocean serv ice center is established.  Second,  the Rosemont  station al ready does the forecasting for the two  largest Lakes-Michigan and Superior.  Combined there were 89 gales and 23  storms on these two lakes alone during  1982. The Rosemont station has han dled these and has proven itself under  fire.  Third,  the Port of Chicago moves  more tonnage than any other port on  the Great Lakes and more internation al shipping docks  in Lake Michigan  than any other lake. Rosemont would  be perfectly located to provide timely,  accurate, and comprehensive weather  information  for  the masters  and  owners of these ships.  Fourth, pleasure boating  is highly  concentrated along the Lake Michigan  coastline near Chicago and going up  into Milwaukee. Most of the victims of  sudden gales are pleasure boaters. The  Rosemont station would ensure that  pleasure boaters  too  get up-to-the minute information on Lake Michigan  weather.  Fifth, the shipping industry in the  Great Lakes wants this ocean service  center in Rosemont. Let me read to  you  from  a  letter  from Daniel E.  Shaughnessy, president of the West ern Great Lakes Shipping Association  which represents six major shipping  companies in the western lakes. I ask  unanimous  consent  that  this  letter  from Mr. Shaughnessy be printed in  the RECORD in full.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  WESTERN GREAT LAKES  MARITIME ASSOCIATION, INC.,  Arlington, VA, June 27, 1984.  Hon. CHARLES H. PERCY,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR  SENATOR PERcY: Our organization  has followed closely the provisions of HR  5712,  dealing with  the  establishment of  seven Regional Ocean Service Centers. Ob viously, we are particularly concerned about  the plans for the Center which will serve  the Great Lakes.  In this regard, we would like to urge that  the current  intent of  the  legislation  to  locate the Great Lakes Center in Rosemont,  Illinois be confirmed and supported by the  full Senate. A decision to locate this facility  at Rosemont is technically sound and would  be of special value to the diverse shipping  interests in Lake Michigan. In particular,  the sizable amount of  international ship ping servicing Lakes Michigan and Superior,  and the volume of maritime traffic general ly in the Western Great Lakes, more than  justifies the location of the Center in Rose mont.  I hope that you will be able to assist on  this matter. Rosemont's excellent location,  ready capabilities, experience, and facilities  make  it an  ideal  location  for  the Great  Lakes Ocean Service Center and in particu lar, its vital weather forecasting functions.  On behalf of our Association and its relat ed maritime and  trade  interests, we urge  that our Great Lakes Ocean Service Center  be located in Rosemont, Illinois.  Sincerely,  DANIEL E. SHAUGHNESSY,  President.  ",1984
1011,998,14,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, I believe  that the facts show that Rosemont is  the best location for the Great Lakes  Regional Ocean Service Center which  we are funding for next year. All the  Great Lakes States will benefit from  it. Shippers in those States will benefit  more from a Rosemont station than  from any other location.  Some  have wanted  the Regional  Ocean Service Center to be located in  Cleveland.  The  reasons  given  for  Cleveland as a  location are not par ticularly convincing. The arguments  have been based on the fact that, since  many commercial associations dealing  with the Great Lakes are located in  Cleveland, the Ocean Service Center  for the Great Lakes ought to be there  too.  Well, I don't buy that argument, Mr.  President. Our first concern in locat ing this Center ought to be that of de termining where it will be most effec tive  in  fulfilling  its main  function:  Furthering safe shipping thro\lgh ac curate weather forecasting. I believe it  is obvious that Rosemont is the best  spot based on these merits.  The House committee has taken a  different  approach  to  this matter,  marking up a supplemental appropria tion bill which funds a study to deter",1984

For the four States that have skills  corporations currently  in operation,  Massachusetts, Minnesota, Washing ton, and Kentucky, plus those States  that establish corporations after en actment of the USSC, a separate pool  of  funds will be established. These  moneys will be available for 5 years  and increase from $5 million the first  year, to $40 million the second year,  and plateau at $75 million for each of  the 3  remaining years.

One  million dollars of each year's competi tive funds pool will be available for in novative and experimental programs  which can be supported with less than  a 50-percent industry contribution.  The USSC will be established as a  small independent agency, headed by  a Director who  is appointed by  the  President  and  confirmed  by  the  Senate, and with an Advisory Board of  15 members from all relevant sectors,  including business,  labor, educational  institutions, and the States. Finally,  the USSC will serve not only to fund  State programs, but to provide a clear inghouse function for information re garding skills corporations and the or ganization and sponsorship of relevant  educational activities, such as confer ences, studies, and reports.  In closing, I stress the partnership  nature of this proposal. I believe it will  join the creative energies of business,  the States, and educational  institu tions in a productive effort to assist  economic development and create and  upgrade jobs. It provides a role for the  Federal Government in assisting eco nomic growth, but allows  the major  thrust to come from the business com munity in cooperation with the States.  Additionally, and very importantly, it  retains a State focus;  all  individual  projects are screened and evaluated on  the State level. Thus responsiveness is  assured  and  further  bureaucracy  avoided. I encourage my colleagues to  review this piece of legislation and ask  that hearings be held  in  the near  future.  Many people had an important role  in crafting this legislation. Susan K.  Moulton, Eric Fenn Elbot, and Steve  Shestakofsky of the Bay State Skills  Corp., were invaluable in providing as sistance, suggestions, and resources in  the development of this proposal.

1013,1050,14,Mr. MATSUNAGA.," Mr. President, I  am  today  introducing with Senators  GORTON,  HEFLIN,  HOLLINGS,  GARN,  INOUYE, PACKWOOD and RIEGLE as CO sponsors, legislation to encourage poli cies, procedures, and operational capa bilities for space rescue.  Mr. President,  it  is an undeniable  truth that the possibility of tragedy in  space increases in proportion to accel erating human  involvement  in space  activities. And as we move ahead with  plans for a manned space station with  international  involvement, which  I  wholeheartedly support, and the fre quency of shuttle flights increases, as  the Soviet Union and other nations  expand their manned spaceflight capa bilities and commitments, it is becom ing imperative that more attention be  paid  to emergency planning for  the  brave men and women who accept the  challenges and risks of space explora tion. Initially, that means recognizing  the fact that the safety of the growing  international corps of astronauts, cos monauts, and spationauts cannot be  effectively protected within a nation alistic framework.  In  the  limitless vastness of space,  emergency  assistance  requires  coop eration on an international scale. The  need for such cooperation  is  in fact  recognized by international treaties, to  which the United States is a signatory,  including  the  ""Agreement  on  the  Rescue of Astronauts,"" the ""Return of  Astronauts and the Return of Objects  Launched  into Outer Space."" More over,  ample  terrestrial  precedent  exists  for  an  international  space  rescue  regime. Emergency assistance  on Earth has always been governed by  a universal code that transcends dif ferences in ideology. Even now, in the  midst of unprecedented cold war ten sion, the United States and the Soviet  Union are linking their space capabili ties  in a Satellite-Aided Search and  Rescue Tracking System  [SARSATl  for locating and rescuing the crews of  downed aircraft and boats in distress  on the high seas. In SARSAT's first 2  weeks of operation, during the fall of  1982, a Soviet satellite guided rescuers  to  two downed aircrafts  in Canada,  one in New Mexico, and to a capsized  yacht 300 miles off the coast of New  England, thereby saving the lives of  seven Americans and Canadians. Since  then, a U.S. satellite has been incorpo rated into the program, to expand its  coverage. Canada and France are also  participating in SARSAT, and other  nations are  lining up  to  join. This  international  program  already  has  been responsible for saving the lives of  200 crew members and passengers of  distressed ships and aircraft.  But, although convincing precedent  exists for space rescue activities, and  although spacefaring nations are com mitted to space rescue in law and in  principle,  the  actual mechanics  of  international space rescue has not yet  been addressed by the affected parties.  The concurrent resolution, which I am  introducing today with seven cospon sors,  urges  that  the United States  show leadership in this humane area  by first, seeking to incorporate inter national space rescue  into space sta tion  planning;  second,  seeking  the  sceintific and technical exchanges nec essary  to  develop  an  international  space rescue regime; and third, exam ining other opportunities for interna tional coordination of U.S. space sta tion programs. With  regard  to  the  space station in particular, it is impor tant that we consider rescue require ments now, while the program is in its  planning stages, so that technical com patibilities, if they are needed, can be  incorporated into design.  In preparing  this  legislation,  I  re ceived assurances  from experts  that  space rescue procedures and compat ibilities could be developed without  risk to national security. Indeed, the  United States is actively seeking inter national involvement in its space sta tion program as part of a civil space  program whose activities, according to  statute, are required  to be free and  open; that's why NASA was created in  the first place. The Soviets, by con trast, have blended civilian and mili tary manned  spaceflight  programs  while conducting both  in an atmos phere of secrecy. We  thus stand to  gain a great deal by encouraging the  openness  that emergency  assistance  coordination would require. It would  provide us with a window onto Soviet  space  activities not otherwise avail able.  Finally, I think it is worth pointing  out that we can draw on significant ex perience in developing a space rescue  program. A primary objective of the  Apollo-Soyuz Test Project [ASTPl of  1975, in which orbiting United States  and Soviet spacecraft linked up and  astronauts  and  cosmonauts met  in  space, was to develop a universal dock ing mechanism  that would facilitate  space rescue. That objective was suecessfully attained. The record in that  instance also shows that, under pres sure of technical imperatives generat ed by ASTP. The Soviets set a number  of precedents for openness,  informa tion exchange, and verification. They  did not do it willingly. They were vir tually forced  into it by pressures in herent  to  cooperative  activity. The  result was not a revolution in behav ior, but it was an extremely promising  beginning. In a letter he wrote to me  about ASTP, one of our astronaut par ticipants,  Donald  ""Deke""  Slayton,  made the following insightful observa tion:  In my opinion, the major thing the Sovi ets could have learned, to their everlasting  benefit, is how to conduct major technical  programs efficiently through the use of free  lateral and vertical comm\mication among  all participants. This would also have been  to our major benefit because it is called de mocracy. Unfortunately,  they  have  not  opted to purloin these lessons yet, but we  should not give up hope.  Unfortunately,  too,  the  universal  docking mechanism  developed  for  ASTP is no longer functional, due to a  lack of followup as the two nations de veloped more advanced manned space  systems. Perhaps that universal dock ing mechanism effort ought to be re newed. At the minimum, as a begin ning, we ought to seek communication  compatibilities and extravehicular pro cedures that would permit rudimenta ry coordination among spacefaring na tions in time of emergency.  Mr. President, no matter how futur istic our advancement into space ap pears,  it can never be considered an  improvement of civilization if it does  not  incorporate  a  commitment  to  rescue fellow human beings in distress.  In April of this year, 11 daring space  explores from three nations were si multaneously  in  orbit  around  the  Earth-five Americans,  five Soviets,  and one Indian. Three Soviets present ly are  in orbit. They will  soon be  joined by five Americans, as manned  space exploration continues to acceler ate. We must not wait for a  tragedy  before taking action on space rescue.  The time to move is now.  Mr. President,  this  legislation has  been  in  the making  for  several  months,  and was  developed  in  its  present form in a bipartisan spirit. We  even forwarded a draft to NASA for its  input a few weeks ago and accepted its  excellent suggestions.  So I was delighted to read in this  morning's newspaper  that President  Reagan proposed only yesterday that  the United States  and  the Soviet  Union  carry out  a  joint  simulated  space rescue mission  involving astro nauts and cosmonauts in orbit. I would  like to think that our discussions with  NASA on this legislation, as well as re lated  legislation  I  introduced with  Senators PELL  and MATHIAS last Feb ruary, had some  influence upon the  ",1984

1019,1115,14,Mr. HART.," Mr. President, it is my  great pleasure  to recommend  to the  Senate approval of H.R. 3825, legisla tion to establish a boundary for the  Black Canyon of  the Gunnison Na tional Monument in western Colorado.  This  legislation will provide neces sary  authorization  for  the Federal  Government to purchase development  rights to 6, 700 acres on the north rim  of  the canyon, establishing  for  the  first time a statutory northern monu ment boundary. Acquisition of these  conservation  easements will  expand  the monument and  insure  the  long term protection of  the viewshed on  the north rim of the canyon.  The Black Canyon of the Gunnison  has long been heralded as a unique na tional resource. The people of Mon trose County and western Colorado  recognized this and mounted an effort  which culminated in the proclamation  of March  designating  the  Black Canyon as  a national monu ment. The monument was enlarged by  similar actions in 1938-39, and 1960 to  its present size of 13,672 acres. In 1978,  over 11,000 acres of  the monument  were designated wilderness, an effort  this Senator  actively  supported  in  Congress.  Today,  the outstanding vistas and  unique experience afforded visitors to  the Black Canyon of the Gunnison is  threatened by development encroach ing on certain areas of the monument.  As agricultural lands become available  for subdividing, areas along the north ern boundary stand  to  lose, and  in  some cases have already lost, the natu ral beauty visitors expect from the Na tion's parklands. If this threat is not  addressed it will only be a matter of  time before development extends  to  the Gunnison River, severely degrad ing the monument's appeal.  Unfortunately, a situation has devel oped which threatens to permanently  alter  the untouched beauty of  the  canyon. A landowner who owns 4,000  of the 6,700 acres proposed for acquisi tion in this bill has started prelimi nary  construction  activities  on  a  planned vacation home development.  When complete, these homes will be  plainly visible from the south rim of  the canyon where the primary visitor  viewpoints are  located. Should Con gress fail to authorize the purchase of  conservation easements on this prop erty, further construction can be ex pected in coming weeks, permanently  defacing the canyon.  I  believe  this  legislation, which  passed the House last March, repre sents the best approach available  to  preserve  the magnificent beauty of  the black Canyon Monument, one of  several national treasures in the State  of Colorado. Purchase of conservation  easements will cost the Federal Gov ernment substantially less money than  fee simple acquisition of the acreage in  the bill.  In addition,  the  legislation  pending before  the Senate has  the  support of a variety of interests,  in cluding affected landowners, the cities  of Montrose and Delta, the counties of  Montrose and Gunnison,  local busi nesses, the environmental community,  the National Park Service and  the  State of Colorado.  Perhaps most important, the legisla tion  is  in  accordance with  existing  plans of the National Park Service for  the monument. Given  the  present  threat to the monument, it is essential  these longstanding plans of the Park  Service be implemented.  Mr. President, because Congress  is  scheduled  to  adjourn  tomorrow,  I  cannot overstate  the  importance of  Senate action on this bill. By approv ing  this  legislation,  the Senate will  help preserve  for many generations  the spectacular, unspoiled beauty of  the Black Canyon of  the Gunnison  National Monument in Colorado.  ",1984
1020,1115,14,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  the Black Canyon of  the Gunnison  River  is unquestionably one of  the  world's premier wild canyons, distin guished by  its unique depth, sheer ness, and narrowness. Flowing down  from the Saguache Mountain Range,  the Gunnison River has carved its way  for centuries through hard, metamor phic  rock, creating  this magnificent  canyon which extends over 50 miles.  Back in 1933, President Hoover recog nized this uniqueness, designating 12  miles of the canyon's center section a  national monument,  and  in  11,180 acres of the monument's 13,672  acres were designated by Congress for  wilderness preservation.  The 7,000 acres at issue in this legis lation are a necessary and desirable  addition to the monument, and with  Senate approval  today of H.R. 3825,  we have cleared  the way  to protect  this  spectacular  viewshed  from  a  major scar on what is truly one of the  wonders of the West. There is a very  real possibility  that, without  legisla tion of this kind, a large residential de velopment will be built on a site that  is visible from many parts of the Black  Canyon,  including the National Park  Service visitors' center. For  several  1976,  weeks now,  the papers  in Colorado  have graphically illustrated the threat  posed by a single landowner in diffi cult financial circumstances; as con gressional consideration of this matter  has gone forward, we have been work ing  in  the shadow of a bulldozer's  blade. At one point,  that bulldozer  went to work and miles of subdivision  roads  were  scratched  into  the  viewshed of the Black Canyon. Pas sage today of this bill moves us much  closer toward purchase of an easement  that will protect all of that viewshed  for future generations to wonder at.  But, I would  like  to make  it very  clear in the legislative history of this  bill  that unusual  circumstances  re quired extraordinary legislative meas ures to protect a very special scenic re source  and  circumstances  are  not  likely to recur very often and should  not.  .  The need for this legislation and the  unusual circumstances I am referring  to are well outlined  in  the hearing  record  and  other  committee  docu ments, and it is not my purpose to re hearse them all now. I do want to take  a moment  and  give well-.deserved  public recognition to the Nature Con servancy,  a  nonprofit  public  lands  trust that is very active in Colorado  and with which I have had the pleas ure of working on several projects that  have greatly benefited our State. The  Nature Conservancy has been negoti ating with the landowner involved in  this case, to determine whether they  can reach an accord that will meet the  landowner's needs and protect the can yon's viewshed until Congress acts to  appropriate the moneys authorized in  the bill we are approving today. The  Nature Conservancy often acts as this  kind of middleman, and  typically  it  gets the results that benefit the public  generally and add great riches to the  wealth of lands being held in trust and  unspoiled for new generations. My ex perience of the men and women of the  Nature Conservancy is that they are  bright, practical, hard working and ef fective men and women who are truly  dedicated  to an important cause.  In  this particular case, they have helped  defuse a potentially disastrous situa tion, and this is typical of an organiza tion that has developed a national rep utation for commonsense preservation  that everyone can benefit from.  I would like to express my thanks to  Senators McCLURE  and  whose wise and capable leadership of  the Energy  and Natural Resources  Committee made swift action on this  measure possible. I am also grateful to  the  dedicated  staff  of  the Senate  Energy and Natural Resources Com mittee,  especially  Tony  Bevinetto,  Gary Ellsworth, and Tom Williams,  and to the staff of the majority and  minority  leaders  for  responding  so  quickly and successfully to the need  JOHNSTON,  ",1984

1028,1128,14,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, as  an original cosponsor of this  impor tant legislation,  I am pleased to ex press my very strong support for S.  875,  the Trademark Counterfeiting  Act of 1984.  Like the tape piracy bill which we  successfully moved  through  the  last  Congress, the Trademark Counterfeit ing Act is intended to deter those who  are determined to profit from the in genuity of others, In protecting trade marks, we ensure that American con sumers will actually enjoy the quality  of product  that a  trademark  is de signed  to  represent. As we  are  all  aware, although much of the publicity  surrounding this problem has focused  on designer  jeans and other  luxury  products,  counterfeit machine parts  are also a problem. Thus, we are deal ing not only with a  trademark issue,  but with a safety problem as well.  S. 875 is intended to provide strong  Federal  penalties  for  intentionally  trafficking in goods or services with  knowledge that they are counterfeit.  Specifically,  a  violation of  the  act  would be punishable by up to 5 years  of  imprisonment  and/ or maximum  fines of $250,000 for individuals and $1  million  for corporations and similar  legal entities. In addition, civil reme dies are available to victims of trade mark counterfeiting,  including treble  damages and  injunctive  relief. This  combination of criminal and civil pen alties for conscious  trademark coun terfeiting will provide an effective de terrent to such activities.  Mr. President, I want to commend  the members of the Subcommittee on  Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks  and their staff for the careful delib erations which preceded our commit tee action on this important measure.  All concerned parties had the opportu nity to comment on various drafts of  this bill and the final product repre sents a  fair balance between various  interests. This bill will provide an ef fective  weapon  against  deliberate  counterfeiters, while  protecting  the  rights of innocent business people.  Mr. President, recently I'had the op portunity to visit an exhibit of coun terfeit goods. I was absolutely appalled  by  the merchandise which appeared  on the surface to be legitimate, but on  closer inspection or use, proved shoddy  or even dangerous. This  intolerable  situation, which injures American con sumers and businesses alike, must be  stopped. In addition to the valiant ef forts  of  the U.S. Customs Service,  prompt passage of S. 875 will greatly  facilitate that effort. I, therefore, urge  my colleagues to support this measure.  ",1984
1029,1128,14,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President, sever al years ago a group of people went  into the business of making and selling  cheap helicopter parts  that  falsely  bore the name of the Bell Helicopter  Co. Their customers,  relying on the  good name of Bell, bought and used  those parts. The matter ended up in  Federal court in Los Angeles, where a  district judge found that the falsely la beled parts were ""defective, not air worthy, and created a grave risk  to  human  life and safety."" The  tragic  result, the court found, was that ""sev eral helicopters have crashed resulting  in injuries and death as the result of  the  failure of  these parts manufac tured and sold by defendants.""  Just 3 months ago, another incident  dramatized the scope and dangers of  trademark  counterfeiting.  In April,  Federal marshals  in Texas and New  York confiscated over 3 million dol lars' worth of almost certainly coun terfeit automobile parts bearing the  trademark of General Motors. The  products  ranged  from  engines  to  brakedrums, and a GM official com mented that many of the parts were of  lower quality than a consumer would  find in a used part in a junkyard. We  can only  imagine what  the  results  might have been  if  these parts had  been installed in the automobiles of  unsuspecting consumers.  These are only the most dramatic of  the many documented incidents of the  sale of goods and services through the  use of false trademarks-now a multi billion dollar business. This practice  threatens  American  trademark  ",1984

1035,1193,14,Mr.  FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman,  I  would  like  to ask  the distinguished  ranking minority member, the gentle man from Pennsylvania, about the $40  million  in borrowing authority. It is  my understanding that the District of  Columbia got some relief from their  court case in the recently passed tax  bill, and that elsewhere in the Con gress there are other bills moving for ward to relieve the same distress more  specifically. As those bills are passed,  is this $40 million then a candidate for  rescission?  ",1984
1036,1193,14,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Chairman, if  the gentleman will yield, I believe he  is talking about $155 million total.  ",1984
1037,1193,14,Mr. FRENZEL., I am sorry. The gen tleman is correct. The figure  is $155  million.  ,1984
1038,1193,14,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Historically, as the  gentleman knows, the District has bor rowed from the U.S. Treasury to fi nance their capital needs. It was an ticipated this year they would be able  to go to the bond markets and borrow  directly, as other municipalities would.  the  Because of  the Chadha case, bond  counsel advises that they cannot issue  an unqualified opinion that the Dis trict of Columbia can back up  the  bonds. Once the counsel can issue that  kind of opinion,  I would  think  this  could  be  subject  to  rescission  and  treated that way.  ",1984
1039,1193,14,Mr. FRENZEL.," Well,  I  thank  gentleman for that comment.  My judgment is that they will be re lieved of the burden of that court case  and will be able to issue bonds on their  own, if they do not already. When the  tax bill is signed they will have that  authority, or have it shortly thereaf ter.  I hope the gentleman will be of as sistance in seeing that this either does  not appear in the conference commit tee report or is later subject to recis sion.  ",1984
1040,1193,14,Mr.  COUGHLIN.," The  gentleman  from Pennsylvania is as anxious as the  gentleman  from Minnesota  to have  the District of Columbia be able to fi nance their capital improvements the  same way as other municipalities do,  by going to the private bond market.  That is one of the reasons for many  years I have striven to have the deficit  reduced  in the District of Columbia  and this is strictly because bond coun sel advised us that they were unable to  issue an unqualified opinion so  that  those bonds could be indeed placed on  the market.  ",1984
1041,1193,14,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman, I am  concerned about this bill, not necessar ily because of what is in it, but because  of what is coming behind. The usual  routine on District bills, as most Mem bers are aware, is that we appropriate  about what we appropriated last year,  because there never is an authoriza tion. Then the bills go into conference  and the Senate adds the increase for  the year, which I estimate to be about  $40 million on this particular year. If  that happens, this bill will wind up to  be $75 million to $80 million over last  year, which would be an increase of  about 13 percent, a little less.  Now, even in its present condition, it  looks to me like it is 61/z percent over  last year.  Again, the House did set for itself a  standard of  a  3%-percent  increase.  Here we find ourselves going over in  the House bill. Later, we will be going  over perhaps by three or four  times  when we come out of conference or  when we are through with supplemen tals, whichever route is chosen, to add  the new money for this year.  ",1984
1042,1193,14,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Chairman, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1984
1043,1193,14,Mr. FRENZEL., I yield to the gentle man from Pennsylvania.  ,1984
1044,1193,14,Mr. COUGHLIN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  just would like to point out that the  increase that was added in the Senate  last year, and the gentleman is correct,  it was about $40 million; in fact, it was  $39 million, was due to a budget request from the administration at that  time between its consideration by the  House committee and its consideration  by the Senate.  0 1340  That budget request came down so  that was not strictly speaking Senate  add on; it was a budget request from  the other body.  I would also say that the increase in  the bill, of course, is largely from the  District's own funds as a result of the  home-rule decision and their increase  in taxes and needs for revenues, and  this  is not a decision that we made  necessarily as a committee, but a deci sion made by the District of Columbia  in its management of the fiscal mat ters of the city.  ",1984
1045,1193,14,Mr. FRENZEL., I thank the gentle man for his illuminating description. I  guess I am mostly concerned with the  Federal payment and because  it  is  under budget amount by $39 million. I  assume that the other body will give  us another $39 million this year.  ,1984
1046,1193,14,Mr. COUGHLIN.," I would not think  so, unless there is a budget request for  it that comes down.  ",1984
1047,1193,14,Mr. FRENZEL.," I hope the gentle man is right and I hope the gentleman  does not succumb to every budget re quest that conies down.  May I say if that is the case, then we  are only twice over the standard we set  ourselves.  Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentle man for yielding and I urge the House  to vote no on another unreasonably  large spending bill.   ",1984
1048,1193,14,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of H.R. 5899,  the District of  Columbia appropriations bill for fiscal  year 1985.  This bill provides $639.5 million in  new budget authority for the District  in this next fiscal year. This total rep resents a 6-percent increase in Federal  funds to the District above last year's  appropriation. The committee recom mendation is $136 million or 21 per cent above the President's budget.  Besides approving over $2.3 billion in  District of Columbia funds,  the bill  provides $52.1 million as a contribu tion  to  the police officers and  fire fighters,  teachers, and  judges retire ment funds.

1068,1219,14,Mr. DANIEL B. CRANE.," Mr. Chair man, my amendment is very straight forwar'tl. It simply restates current law  that all Federal employees, without  regard to sex or any other condition,  shall receive equal pay for equal work.  The Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 both require  equal pay  for  equal work  in most  places of employment. The concept  applies to the Government's wage-set ting process. The requirement of equal  pay for substantially equal work is em bodied in current law in title V. The  term ""substantially equal"" is the term  now used in title V. The terms ""equal""  and ""substantially equal"" have a clear  legal meaning. They can be readily ap plied and understood from decades of  use.  The language of this bill, however,  uses the new and controversial term  ""comparable"" in several key areas. In  outlining discriminatory wage-setting  practices,  the  language  of  the bill  refers to ""comparable duties, responsi bilities,  and  qualification  require ments."" It refers to a study of ""compa rable working conditions"" that apply  to both white collar and blue collar  employees.  In discussing  job evalua tion  techniques  that are  to be em bodied  in the proposed study,  those  conducting the study are required by  this  bill  to  establish  an  objective  method of determining the ""compara tive value"" of ""different positions"" in  the Federal Government. The  term  ""comparable"" in this bill is clearly a  substitute for  the term ""comparable  worth."" In fact, a direct reference to  comparable worth was used in an earli er version of  this  legislation  in  the  summary and conclusions and findings  in H.R. 4599.  The problem is that there is no such  thing  as  comparable worth. There  exists no definition of the term ade quate to apply it to job evaluation. Yet  we are asked  to approve  legislation  based on a meaningless concept, and  to reject the concept of equal pay for  equal work.  I emphasize to my colleagues-this is  not an equal pay for equal work bill. If  it were, my amendment would not be  necessary. It is a comparable worth  bill. Advocates of that concept gener ally mean that jobs should be valued  equally and paid the same even if the  jobs themselves are radically different.  For example, they might insist that a  plumber and a receptionist be paid the  same,  because  they  are worth  the  same. Obviously, worth is subjective:  If your basement floods, a plumber is  worth much more than a receptionist.  But would you want your plumber sit ting in your front office greeting con stitutents?  Obviously, comparable worth is an  apples and oranges comparison.  Although  the  term  ""comparable  worth""  is meaningless,  there  is no  question  as  to what  its  advocates  intend: The abandonment of salaries  set by the free market in response to  supply  and  demand.  Instead,  they  would marshal the powers of the Fed eral Government  to  tell  employers  what wages they shall pay.  Needless to say, this is not a concept  that the Congress should endorse. In  fact, if we do, there is a very real possi bility the Federal Government would  find  itself facing many of  the same  problems  the State of Washington  faces  today. On December 14, 1983,  U.S. District Judge Jack E. Tanner or dered Washington to award back pay  and  higher  salaries  to more  than  15,000 mostly female employees at a  cost of over $800 million. The lawsuit  in question was not based upon the  charge  that  employees were  being  denied equal pay for equal work. The  ruling was based on the same principle  embodied in the bill before us today:  that of comparable worth. The basis  for the charge brought by the litigants  was a comparable worth study of the  jobs of State employees-just the kind  of study called for in this legislation,  which could-and  I  predict will-be  the basis for similar actions against  the Federal Government if this bill is  successful.  Mr. Chairman, my amendment calls  for equal pay for equal work. A vote  against it is a vote against equal pay  for equal work. Equality is our goal,  and to achieve that goal is the object  of my amendment.  ",1984
1069,1219,14,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Chairman,  will the gentleman yield?  ",1984
1070,1219,14,Mr. DANIEL B. CRANE., I yield to  the gentleman from California.  ,1984
1071,1219,14,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Chairman,  it is my understanding that under the  definition of discrimination  in H.R.  that the consultant doing this  study would have the power of law to  determine what is or is not discrimina tory. Is that your reading of the bill?  ",1984
1072,1219,14,Mr. DANIEL B. CRANE.," That  is  indeed my view of the language in this  bill. This consultant is not doing an  academic study. The consultant has  the power to determine what is dis criminatory. And that finding can go  5680,  well beyond the equal pay for equal  work standard of the law. His finding  is based on equal pay for comparable  work.  The  consultant's  findings  appear to be final. Congress has only  one role: To agree to those findings,  right or wrong.  ",1984
1073,1219,14,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," If the gentle-  man would yield further. This word  ""comparable"",  then,  is  at  variance  with the law governing how wages are  paid to Federal employees. Is that cor rect?  ",1984
1074,1219,14,Mr. DANIEL B. CRANE.," The gentle man is again correct. Under 5 U.S.C.  5101 and 5341, both whiteand blue collar jobs are paid according to this  principle: equal pay for substantially  equal work. Nowhere  is  the word  ""comparable"" found in the current law  covering Federal employees.  ",1984
1075,1219,14,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," If the gentle man would yield further, I think Mem bers would be interested in the views  of  the mayor of Detroit, Coleman  Young, on  the  issue of comparable  worth:  Any time a city gets hung up on an ab stract study that makes arbitrary compari sons of jobs but does not take into account  the impact on society and its ability to pay,  that's dealing in potential anarchy and in viting bankruptcy .... If a painter makes  more than a secretary then let more women  be painters.  I think that is a fairly potent state ment about this controversial issue.  ",1984

He had  misled me, at  least my perceptions  were not, according  to what I have  heard  today, accurate. I  thought he  was violently opposed  to  the whole  idea of this study when it was before  the committee, and if indeed, I have  misunderstood him heretofore, I offer  public apology for that. I know that  he offers these amendments under his  newly expressed spirit of support for  his concept, and not with any inten tion of messing it up.  Unfortunately, my dear friend and  committee member  from  Illinois  is  muddling around with something, and  creating the impression that he does  not understand why there is any real  difference. I am sure he does, because  he is one of the more clever members  of that committee and spends a good  deal of time. He is industrious and a  very able member of the committee,  and so I have to call his attention to  the fact that he really is  leading us  down the wrong path.

Mr. Chairman,  offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  I  Amendment offered by Mr. McHuGH: Page  163, after line 21, insert the following:  SEc. 762. The project for flood control, En dicott, Johnson City, and Vestal, New York,  authorized by  the Flood Control Act of  1954,  is hereby modified to authorize the  Secretary  to undertake such measures as  may be necessary to correct erosion prob  lems affecting  the  levee at Vestal, New  York, and to perform necessary work to pro tect the levee and restore it to its design  condition, at an estimated cost of $700,000.  The non-Federal share of the cost of such  measures  and work  shall be determined  under section 302 of this Act.  Mr. McHUGH <during the reading).  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous con sent that the amendment be consid ered  as  read  and  printed  in  the  RECORD.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  New York?  There was no objection.  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Chairman,  the  amendment I am offering would au thorize the Army Corps of Engineers  to undertake  remedial work on  the  Federal flood control project in Vestal,  NY, which is located in my congres sional district. Under the amendment,  the corps is directed to take all neces sary measures and perform the work  required to protect an existing levee  by correcting serious erosion problems  and to restore the levee to its design  condition. Mr. Chairman, the area pro tected by this levee is in jeopardy if  the work is not performed. It is a seri ous situation that cannot be addressed  by existing law, and I would like to de scribe it for my colleagues so that they  will  understand  the  need  for  this  amendment.  At the present time, the levee, which  is on the Susquehanna River, is seri ously  threatened due  to chronic soil  erosion problems. According to a field  examination done by  the corps,  the  erosion is the result of the river being  directed against the left bank because  of an island in the center of the river  and a bend in the riverbank. These  natural changes in the river have re sulted in the left bank being undercut  and endangering the levee. According  to this report, the erosion is continu ous and the deterioration will result in  a failure of the levee. Ultimately, the  surrounding communities will be  im periled by floodwater. Action is neces sary to halt the erosion and prevent  the levee from collapsing.  Mr. Chairman, I would also like to  point out that the corps' report deter mined that the erosion is beyond the  scope of New York State's mainte nance responsibility. Moreover, it de termined  that  the problem has not  been caused by any dereliction of duty  on the part of the State. In fact, the  New York State Department of Envi ronmental Conservation  has  taken  steps to try to solve the problem and  stem  the  erosion.  However,  these  measures  are  temporary  given  the  scale and severity of the problem as  defined by the corps' report. Permanent, corrective measures are required  to solve the problem and insure that  the communities are protected from  the floodwaters of the Susquehanna.  If the levee were to fail, several hun dred residences, commercial establish ments and public buildings would be  vulnerable  to  the resulting floodwa ters. More than half of the buildings  would experience flooding on the first  level, and all would have to be evacu ated by boat as the waters would total ly  isolate  the  area. Obviously  the  threat to the area and its citizens is a  grave one.  Since the erosion problem is not the  result of negligence on the part of the  State, I think it is appropriate to pro vide Federal assistance to correct the  problems by stabilizing the riverbank  and restoring the design protection of  the levee. I believe we have a responsi bility to protect these communities.  In addition to protecting the area  surrounding the levee, I think that we  have an obligation to protect the in vestment  that  the Federal Govern ment has already made  in the con struction of this flood control project.  It has been estimated that the restora tions will cost $700,000. However,  it  will be far cheaper to perform the cor rective work,  restore  the  levee, and  prevent its collapse than it would be to  construct an entirely new flood con trol project that would be needed if  the existing one fails and must be re placed.  In summary, therefore, my amend ment allows us to fulfill our duty to  protect the lives and property of those  threatened by the potential failure of  the levee, and the opportunity for us  to protect the legitimate financial in terest that the Federal Government  has in the project. I believe my amend ment makes sense in human and eco nomic terms.  I urge my colleagues to support it.  ",1984

1097,1336,14,Mr. ROE.," If you deauthorize that  land today, you have nothing to re place  it. You  have no  system,  no  matter what the State of Florida has  done, because there is a reversionary  clause in the agreement in the State  of Florida that has to do with that  land and how that land would be dis posed of and in the agreement it is not  that the land would be returned to the  people of Florida at  the price  they  paid for it, no way. Under the legisla tion that has been proposed and in the  article in the Washington Post in the  headline, that today the people should  be recompensed at fair market value,  and  fair market value  comes  from  where? Where does that money come  from? It comes from an authorization  of the Congress of the United States  that has yet to be decided, not what  you do on deauthorization.  Oh, yes, it does if that is to be re placed at fair market value. That is  what part of that agreement is.  Let me finish now. I have listened to  everybody here and to keep me quiet  for an hour is a miracle. That is why I  did not interrupt the brothers. Now,  please do not ask me for time at this  moment.  Now, we went behind  this  issue.  There are two documents which are  facts that I want to call to your atten tion. One  is a coummunication that  came in to our committee in the study  of this issue and it came in from then  Secretary Gianelli and he says as fol lows:  In summary, it seems to me we are on the  horns of a dilemma. On the one hand we  have a one-third completed project which is  not operable for its originally intended purpose and with its attendant continuing li ability to operate and maintain what facili ties are in place. We should try to minimize  any continuing Federal responsibilities on  the other hand. It seems to me that the  state by virtue of its initial support for the  project should have some liability towards  the continuing responsibility that exists. It  may be appropriate to raise the entire issue  officially with the State.  Then he closes on this statement:  I would suggestHe is writing this to the Office of  Management and Budgetwe take no position on the de-authorization  pending in the legislation in the Congress at  this time.  In  the  report  that we have  that  came from the Corps of Engineers, the  indepth report and in the study that  was made by another distinguished  gentleman  from Florida,  there  is a  statement and it goes as follows:  Current estimate of value of land, a mean ingful figure is not available.  No one knows at this point what the  exposure of the Federal Government  is  to  try  to make Florida whole.  Nobody can tell you that. The corps  cannot tell you that. I cannot tell you  that. Nobody else can because there  have been no appraisals made of what  the cost today or what the repayment  would be involved today in this overall  program.  Now, there is a letter from the attor ney general of  the State of Florida  and the attorney general writes in the  State of Florida and he speaks in his  letter of  the problems of  the court  suits that are being bantered back and  forth on this  issue and he makes a  very succinct point and if you will just  indulge me for 1 minute more he says:  Since these cases are triedHe  is  talking  Power Light Co.about  the Florida  the  company  has  filed  suit  in Marion  County seeking to recover fee title on their  land. Of this land, 3,200 acres are under or  around the Lake Ocklawaha area and 5,900  acres border the Ocklawaha River  in  the  proposed Eureka Pool.  It does not mean too much to too  many, but it says:  Unfortunately present and future recrea tion issues may be thwarted, first if all or  most of the canal authority lands are re turned to private ownership, the protection  of sensitive ecological resources contemplat ed by the 1979 legislation or any degree or  restoration  will  vastly  complicate  the  system or make it nonworkable.  Now, you have been very kind to me.  Now have given me more time than  you should have, but let me say this to  you. I am not before you as chairman  of  this committee as your friend  to  argue  the  issue of  this barge or  to  argue  the  issue of a determination  today. I am saying to the members of  this committee that to vote deauthor ization of this project now, and I am  not judging the merits of the two posi tions,  is  to say  that you  throw  the  ",1984
1098,1349,14,Mr. OBEY.," I just want to say that I  agree with  the gentleman's observa tion about the issue in question. I, as a  result of the way  the Public Works  Committee dealt with this issue, I am  going to be offering legislation as soon  as we return, forbidding the require ment that anyone under the age of 21  be required to register for the draft so  long as the provisions of that legisla tion are in effect.  I find it absurd to tell people that  they are old enough to pick up a gun  and carry it for this country, but if  they are married and are sitting in the  privacy of their own home, that they  should not be allowed to have a glass  of wine. I just think that prohibition  in the end will work no better for 20year-olds  than  it works  for 40-year olds.  I think that the way this issue was  handled by the committee is most un fortunate. I will be looking for ways to  provide an opportunity for this House  to give a full discussion of those issues  involved. Regardless of how you feel  about the issue, a major social and so ciological change such as this should  have been discussed fully with notice.  It was not;  I  do not quarrel with  anyone who has different views than I  do on the subject, but I do believe that  the House made a major mistake last  evening, and  I will be circulating a  letter asking Members to join me in  that legislation because I think it indi cates  the  inconsistency of what was  done, not so much last night, because  it was  inevitable at  that point, but  what was done earlier when the House  passed  the  legislation  in  the  first  place.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",1984
1099,1349,14,Mr. JEFFORDS.," I thank the gentle man  for  his  comments,  and  I  am  pleased  to note that certainly  there  are others in this body that agree with  me. I would also point out that at the  time  this was brought up and dis cussed it also was done with no vote  and on very short notice.  While I'm at it, let me take a shot at  the civil libertarians, too. We have said  with this legislation that an 18-year old should be able to get blown to bits  in Beirut, but Heaven forbid that he  or she buy a Bloody Mary back home.  I seem to recall a bill, stillborn in the  Energy  and Commerce Committee,  that would have prohibited discrimi nation in insurance based on gender,  race, or nationality. The argument, if I  could summarize  it, was,  ""Why not  look at people as individuals?"" Some  teenage boys are good drivers. Why  should  they  be  treated  arbitrarily  based on their sex?  And why,  I  ask my  colleagues,  should  they  be  treated  arbitrarily  based on their age? There is no ques tion about it, some teenagers do not  drive responsibly. So why not require  the driving age be raised to 21? Exces sive teenage drinking does not endan ger anyone in most cases, bad driving  does, whether it's under the influence  of booze or drugs, or simply a high speed joy ride.  Why don't we raise the driving age?  Well, that's an issue for the States to  decide. You bet  it  is,  and so's the  drinking age. The States don't think  that they should have  to submit to  this Federal blackmail, and  I don't  either. The National Governors' Asso ciation has gone on record in opposi tion, and I would be remiss if I did not  also mention the considerable courage  shown on this issue by my own State's  Governor, Richard Snelling,  a  past  president of the' NGA.  By the way, what happened to the  States' rights  advocates  last night?  Looks  like  the Sagebrush Rebellion  has a bad case of stage fright.  The young people in this country,  too, share in this mess. My office has  received only a handful of mail on this  issue  from young Vermonters. They  and their peers had better wake up to  the fact that their interests can only  be  represented  if  their  voices  are  heard. Last night they lost the privi lege to drink as far as Congress is con cerned. Who knows what they will lose  on the eve of the next recess?  Without a  doubt, we need  to do  something  to  reduce  the number of  drunk drivers on our Nation's roads.  But it is a vast oversimplification to  think that this problem will go away  by increasing the drinking age.  We have all heard the statistics that  18to 21-year-olds make up 9 percent  of the country's drinking population  yet they are involved in 17 percent of  all alcohol-related accidents. Sure this  figure is high, but what of the remain ing 83 percent of the accidents? An in crease in the drinking age is not about  to touch this group. Raising the drink ing age  is a copout, a band-aid ap proach to a very serious problem. We  need to actively address this issue and  not hide behind a carrot and stick idea  passed one night with the hope that  all will be fine the next.  Rather  than  the Federal Govern ment intruding upon a traditional re sponsibility of the States, I think our  time would be better spent becoming  involved  in programs and  initiatives  that will get at the heart of this prob lem. Instead of a reward of transporta tion funds, how about a reward of in creased  education  funds  for States  that institute mandatory educational  programs on the dangers of drinking  and driving?  The idea of encouraging stiff crimi nal penalties for drunk driving  is a  good one. This cuts across  all  age  groups and does not require the sin gling out of any one group. A drunk  driver of any age  is a menace and  should be controlled. I can support our  encouragement of this type of action  by the States.  We must really look at what we have  done by increasing the drinking age.  Could we  be  promoting  backyard,  house party, even on-the-road drink ing instead of the relatively supervised  drinking in a bar or restaurant? What  we need is a higher level of conscious ness on this issue among a broad range  of groups and individuals: individuals  of drinking age, parents, teachers, leg islators, bar and  restaurant owners,  enforcement officials, et cetera. If this  will  take a combination of education  and enforcement, let's get on with it.  But,  let's not think that w~ can sit  back and pat ourselves on the back for  increasing the drinking age to 21.  And let's not get too sanctimonious  in the future about our willingness,  our eagerness,  to  take on the tough  issues. Last night was a sad day for  this body. Let there not be another  one.

1100,1349,14,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, tonight  I have requested a special order, along  with Representative  FRANK,  Repre sentative AcKERMAN, and Representa tive LANTos, so that we in the House of  Representatives might have  this op portunity to pay tribute to a remarka ble community of men, women, and  children, the Ethiopian Jews.  This week of June 24  to July 1 is  being celebrated in many places across  the United States, Canada, and Israel  as an International Week of Solidarity  with Ethiopian Jewry. It is an oppor tunity for all of us engaged  in the  struggle for greater international rec ognition  and observance  of human  rights to recognize the truly remarka ble men, women, and children whom  we seek to aid. These people fully ap preciate  the  importance  of human  rights, and what it is like to live as a  threatened minority, yet they are will ing to pay any price, endure any hard ship to protect their most precious and  cherished heritage and traditions. The  Jews of Ethiopia are just one of the  many  groups  of  people  struggling  today  to protect and preserve  their  way of  life against the pressures of  governmental  indifference,  hostility,  and sometimes the indifference of the  international  community. But  they  struggle on.  For over 2,000 years the Falasha, as  they are sometimes called, have main tained their Judaism despite centuries  of isolation from other Jewish groups,  and the constant pressures to assimi late,  to give up  their different ways  and beliefs and to fit in to the more  ",1984

1104,1388,14,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to the Hon. David  Norton Edelstein for his 33 years of  outstanding service on the U.S. Dis trict Court for the Southern District  of New York.  It  is my pleasure  to  bring  to  the  attention of my  col leagues in the U.S. House of Repre sentatives the accomplishments of this  dedicated servant of the law.  Judge Edelstein received his masters  degree and his law degree from Ford ham University. Upon admittance to  the New York State Bar, he began his  long and distinguished career of public  service as an assistant U.S. attorney  for the Southern District of New York  in 1945. His enthusiasm and  intelli gence earned him the respect of his  superiors, and, only 6 years later, he  was nominated judge of the U.S. Dis trict Court for the Southern District  of New York. In 1971, he was nominat ed chief judge.  These accomplishments bespeak a  first-rate legal mind, but they do not  give due credit to the numerous contri butions Judge Edelstein has made to  his profession over the years. For ex ample, he is a former elected member  of  the  Judicial Conference of  the  United States, the Attorney General's  Conference on Crime,  the Steering  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Committee of the New York Federal  Executive Board, the Planning Com mittee of the Metropolitan Conference  of Chief Judges, and the founder of  the  student  litigation  training pro gram for the Southern District. Judge  Edelstein has also been active in nu merous professional associations,  in cluding the Federal Bar Association,  the American Bar Association, and the  American Trial Lawyers Association.  In view of these and other accom plishments, it is clear that the Nation  owes Judge Edelstein a debt of grati tude for the energy and enlightened  leadership he has provided during the  past  33  years.  Perhaps  his  distin guished career is best summed up by  paraphrasing  the  great  American  jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes:  ""The  rule of joy and the law of duty seem to  him all one.""  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I call upon  my colleagues in the Congress of the  United States to join me in this oppor tunity to pay tribute to the Honorable  David Norton Edelstein.e  BUFFALO'S CHICKEN WINGS  MARK 20TH ANNIVERSARY  HON.HENRYJ.NOWAK  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 28, 1984   ",1984
1105,1388,14,Mr. NOWAK.," Mr. Speaker, James  Griffin,  the distinguished mayor of  the  city of Buffalo, NY,  has pro claimed this week as ""Buffalo Chicken  Wing Festival Week.""  This delicacy was  invented in 1964  by Frank and Teressa Bellissimo at  the Anchor Bar  in Buffalo and  its  fame, popularity, and availability have  spread to many cities in the United  States and even to London, England.  As part of this anniversary observ ance,  6,000  of  these chicken wings  were added today to the buffet in the  Members' private dining room to ac quaint  them with  this  tasty morsel  that originated in my hometown.  For  the RECORD, Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to insert the following arti cles  on  this  observance which  ap peared in the Buffalo News and the  New York Times:  [From the Buffalo News, June 28, 19841  CHICKEN WINGS WILL BE KING OF CAPITOL  HILL  <By Douglas Turner>  WASHINGTON.-Buffalo-style  chicken  wings, flown in from Buffalo, mind you, will  invade the House of Representatives side of  the federal Capitol at lunchtime tomorrow.  There will be 6,000 cooked wings, with  celery and three gradations of blue-cheese  sauce available for the 435 members of the  House in their private dining room.  The event marks the 20th anniversary of  the  invention of Buffalo-style wings  by  Frank and Teressa Bellissimo at their res taurant, Frank and Teressa's Anchor Bar,  Main and East North Street, Buffalo.  June 28, 1984  Actually,  the wing  snack was  created  there  in July 1964. Nevertheless, Mayor  Griffin has designated the week of June 25July 1 as ""Buffalo Chicken Wing Festival '  Week,""  The observance at  the Capitol was ar ranged by Reps. John J. LaFalce, D-Town of  Tonawanda, and Henry J. Nowak, D-Buffa lo, with the cooperation of House Doorkeep er James T. Molloy, a former Buffalo fire fighter.  Their will be a welcoming ceremony of  sorts at the south entrance of the Capitol  involving the congressmen, Mr. Molloy and  a model hired in Washington to play the  part of ""the Buffalo Chicken, Wilhelmina  Wing.""  The wings  and  the  transportation are  being provided by a subsidiary of the Dela ware North Companies Inc., which provides  food service at a number of airports includ ing Greater Buffalo  International  and  Washington National.  Representing Delaware North will  be  Peter Castrilli, Washington regional direc tor of its Air Terminal Services subsidiary,  and Ernest Wooden, boss of the Sport Serv ice subsidiary here, concessionaire at the  Washington Convention Center.  Mr. Molloy, whose help was required be cause he  controls  the House  restaurant  system, said he is sure that House members  will be able to consume only a minority of  the donated wings.  He said as a result, he will see they are  shared with House staffers and others.  Buffalo-style chicken wings are among the  fast foods sold  in the converted old Post  Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, now called  the Pavilion. The popularity of the dish has  spread to Harbor Place in Baltimore and as  far away as London.  The delicacy has supplanted beef on kum melweck as the most popular dish at the  annual Buffalo Night Party staged by Rep.  Nowak; Rep. Jack F. Kemp, R-Hamburg;  and Rep. LaFalce in one of the House office  buildings.  This is the first tribute to wings in the  Capitol. Perhaps they'll get a reception in  the White House Rose Garden on their 25th  anniversary.  [From the New York Times, June 27, 19841  CHICKEN WINGS OF BUFFALO  This week  is Buffalo Chicken Wings  Week,  according  to  a  proclamation  by  Mayor James Griffin. The city's famous cul inary product was created on the spur of a  moment in July 1964 by Teressa Bellissimo,  opening  the  kitchen  of  her  husband's  Anchor Bar on Main Street while her son  Dominic tended bar out front.  A bunch of the buddies were drinking and  enjoying  theinselves,"" Dominic Bellissimo,  who is frequently known as Rooster, said re cently, recalling the historic occasion. ""It  was a Friday night at exactly 12 o'clock.  Mother went into the icebox, where there  was a big platter of chicken wings. She  chopped them down the middle, she impro vised a barbecue sauce which we continue to  use to this day with very little embellish ment and she got out the blue cheese dress ing we used for the salad. She brought out  this big platter and my buddies at the bar  went crazy.  It took a  good month,  five  weeks, and they just mushroomed into what  today has become a business within  the  business.''  It goes without saying that the ingredi ents of the masterpiece are secret. Mr. Bel lissimo says he does not even make the bar",1984
1106,9,18,Mr. GORE.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank my colleague [Mr. WAXMAN] for  his kind words and for yielding this  time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I want to urge all of  my colleagues in this body to support  this bill unanimously. This bill was re ported unanimously from the Commit tee on Energy and Commerce.  This bill  represents  a  victory  for  both the tobacco industry and for the  public health community but most of  all it is a victory for the public health.  Mr. Speaker,  this  is a meaningful  moment for me. The process of getting  this bill to this point has had all the  ups and downs of a problem pregnan cy, and believe me, it has been a diffi cult delivery. The negotiations were  long and arduous, at times frustrating,  and at other times exhilirating. I can  remember moments when I was sure  this effort would end in failure. But,  fortunately, the parties persevered.  There are many people who played a  major role in this legislation. Subcom mittee Chairman HENRY WAXMAN has  been working on this issue for 2 years  and provided vital leadership and ex pertise. Certainly Committee Chair man JoHN DINGELL played the pivotal  role in getting this legislation to the  floor.  Congressman  CHARLIE  RosE  must also be singled out for his role,  for without him, we would not be here  today.  My efforts on this compromise were  to slug it out in the trenches over each  sentence and word. One could have  had no better partner in this challenge  than Congressman MIKE SYNAR, who  was there every step of the way. I ap plaud him for his diligence and per sistence. Rounding our the ""Gang of  Five""  that helped  in  these negotia tions were Congressman AI. SWIFT,  DENNIS ECKART, and JERRY SIKORSKI.  It was a difficult road for all of us but  clearly worth the effort.  The health community was involved  every step of the way during our long  negotiations. They were  brilliantly  served  by Coalition Staff Director  Matt Myers, who perhaps more than  anyone else kept  these  talks going  with intellect, creativity, and a tireless  resolve to get a fair bill.  The tobacco indm=try and its repre sentatives must also ,_ e singled out and  congratulated for their work. No one  worked  harder  on  this  bill  than  Howard Liebengood, who brought an  impeccable  reputation  for  integrity  and professionalism into the talks and  led the negotiations with a firm but  fair hand. The compromise would not  have been possible without his efforts.  This bill  represents  a  progressive  and courageous step by the tobacco in dustry that caught many by surprise.  This has been a bitter pill for them to  swallow, but in doing so,  they have  made stiffer punitive  legislation  less  I will  likely in the years ahead. The industry  has been the target of intense criti cism over the past decade, in part be cause of an unwillingness to compro mise and recognize current health re search data and public opinion. But  this bill today shows that the industry  is willing to take a courageous stand.  Coupled with similar compromises in  other areas, this represents a dramatic  new era for this industry. I applaud  them for their efforts and their vision.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is a victory for  both the health community and the  tobacco industry but most important ly,  it is a victory for public health.  Smoking  is  the No.  1  preventable  cause of illness and death in this coun try, and the American people have the  right  to be  informed of  the conse quences of cigarette smoking. The bill  we are working on today will play a  major role in the years ahead in pro viding  information on a  continuing  basis on  the  risks  and hazards of  smoking.  I  represent a congressional district  that has 10,000  tobacco  farmers, all  with  limited acreage. Tennessee has  100,000  tobacco  farmers. With  their  help, I have learned to separate health  concerns from farming  issues.  support with all my strength  their  right to continue growing tobacco on  their small farms. But at the same  time, neither I nor they have any illu sions about  the harmful effects of  smoking.  The Surgeon General has concluded  that smoking  is  the single greatest  preventable  cause  of death  in  the  United States. Each year,  there are  130,000 smoking-related deaths linked  to  cancer  (lung  cancer  and  other  forms) in this country. An additional  170,000 deaths from heart disease are  smoking-related. And another 50,000  die each year from emphysema and  other chronic obstructive lung diseases  brought on by smoking.  In his latest report on smoking and  health,  the Surgeon General  found  that children of parents who smoke  have more  respiratory problems,  in cluding  the  increased  incidence  of  bronchitis and pneumonia early in life,  than children of nonsmokers. Respira tory problems are a legacy that smok ers leave with their children. The evi dence is also clear that tobacco smoke  harms nonsmokers exposed to it.  Some argue that we need a much  longer debate on whether or not there  are health hazards related to smoking,  but farmers in my State don't feel a  need to pretend falsely that smoking  may be good for you. They are honest  and candid and strong. The evidence is  so clear and so overwhelming  there  should be no doubt about the need for  this legislation.  While  recognizing  the  evidence  during these long negotiations, I have  also kept foremost in my mind the le gitimate interests and concerns of the  tobacco industry. We want the Ameri can people to be informed about the  risks of smoking but we do not want to  change the legal exposure of the to bacco industry. We want the informa tion given to the American people to  be accurate, but not alarmist or exag gerated. And  that  is what  this bill  does.  The bill before us is a true compro mise keeping the essential elements of  a  comprehensive  smoking education  program but  recognizing  the  legiti mate concerns of the tobacco industry.  This is a tough bill but it is a fair bill.  It is truly a historic occasion when  the tobacco industry and the health  community can link arms in favor of  passage of a piece of legislation of this  kind. I can't recall this happening in  the past. The effort here today is a  victory for both sides and they should  be congratulated. But the real winner  will be the American people and the  contribution  this bill will make  to  public health. I am very proud to have  played a part in this process.  0 1230  ",1984

1108,9,18,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I find  mysell in the last couple of weeks car rying legislation on this floor where  one particular member of our commit tee has played such a very crucial and  important role. Last week, we received  a  unanimous vote of  the House of  Representatives on legislation to speed  the approval of generic drugs as well  as giving additional patent time to the  brand name drug companies. A very  important, significant player, in that  legislation was  Congressman MIKE  SYNAR.  Today we have before us legislation  on cigarette labeling. If it were not for  his efforts, we would not be here today  on a Suspension Calendar. We would  be fighting it out in a way that might  not have been helpful for anybody and  certainly not for the cause of getting  legislation actually passed into law.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman  from  Oklahoma  [Mr.  SYNAR], a man who has distinguished  himself  as  a  legislator,  and  I  am  pleased to consider him my friend.  ",1984

1110,35,18,Mr. MORRISON  of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  bill,  H.R.  3347,  the  Extradition  Reform Act of 1984. This bill is the  product of the work of the Committee  on  the Judiciary over  the past  two  Congresses. The chairman of the Sub committee on Crime, my distinguished  colleague  from  New  Jersey  HUGHES], is to be congratulated.  Last Congress the committee report ed a bill which raised serious concerns  in  the  community of persons  con cerned  about  international  human  rights, and, due to the heavy agenda  at the end of the session, that bill was  not voted on. This Congress the com mittee began  the  legislative process  again, and-in my view-improved on  its work. This Congress the committee  further refined the definition of a po litical offense and, most importantly,  met the legitimate concerns about the  need to add additional procedural pro tections to guard against the abuse of  human rights.  The bill before us this afternoon has  the strong support of  the American  Bar Association, the Association of the  Bar of the city of New York, and the  American Civil Liberties Union. This is  so because  the bill dramatically  im proves Federal law by providing the  Federal  courts with  authority  to  refuse  to extradite a person  if  that  person establishes by a preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  the  person's  return will result in either impermissi ble persecution or subject the person  to fundamental unfairness. This safe guard is derived from the United Na tions Convention and Protocol on the  Status of Refugees and parallels the  treatment given to alleged offenders in  virtually  all  modern  democracies.  Great Britain, the Federal Republic of  Germany, Israel, Australia, New Zea land, India, and Sweden, for example,  all permit courts to inquire into the  bona fides of an extradition request.  Opponents of this feature of the bill  argue that Federal courts should not  be involved in such foreign policy mat ters. That type of argument has also  been made-and rejected-only recent ly by the House in the context of po litical asylum decisions. We all know  that the Department of State must, of  necessity, make decisions about indi vidual issues-including extradition re quests-in the context of our total re lations with other countries. There is  almost an  inherent conflict  in  roles  when we ask the Department of State  to make judicial determinations about  whether an alleged offender will  re ceive nondiscriminatory, fundamental ly fair treatment in a requesting coun try. It is unavoidable that the Depart ment of State will be asked to refuse a  person's extradition because of allega tions of persecution or grossly abusive  treatment in the requesting country.  It is virtually impossible for that polit ical department to weigh that individual human rights claim without con sidering the ramifications any decision  would have on our relations with that  nation. Thus, reliance on the Federal  courts to resolve  these  issues  is the  only fair and objective method for re solving these issues.  I also note that the bill contains an  important  amendment which  I  au thored, which was adopted in commit tee. Under the bill a person like the  late Senator Aquino of the Phillipines,  who was charged with a conspiracy,  would still have been able to avoid ex tradition by asserting the political of fense  defense.  Opponents  of my  amendment want  to  preclude  such  protection. This view is shortsighted.  If an alleged offender conspired and  completed a heinous act, the defense is  unavailable. Under my amendment, all  that is permitted is the assertion of a  defense if mere inchoate conduct is al leged.  I strongly urge my colleagues to sup port this measure.e  ",1984

1117,61,18,Mr. PERCY.," Mr. President, one of  the major foreign policy programs of  the Reagan administration has been  the Caribbean Basin Initiative.  Congress has debated the program  for several years and the major parts  of the President's program are now in  place, covering trade and aid. When  the President identified the Caribbean  1 Hospitals magazine, July 1, 1984.  countries for special attention, he was  acknowledging  the vital  importance  they play in our own national security  and economic well-being.  Sometimes in Washington, officials  question how interested the public is  in  foreign policy and overseas pro grams like the Caribbean Basin Initia tive.  I am pleased to report to the Senate  that at least in Chicago, there is over whelming support for the CBI and the  President's overall program among the  business community.  In October 1982,  the Agency  for  International Development  awarded  the Chicago Association of Commerce  and Industry-the largest chamber of  commerce in the country-a grant to  launch  a  private  sector Caribbean  Basin Program. The concept behind  this grant was that the private sector  might be able to accomplish more in  trade and economic growth in the Car ibbean  than mere Federal Govern ment projects.  I have just received a report from  CACI about the progress  they have  made in their two pilot countries: The  Dominican Republic and Costa Rica.  The  Caribbean  Basin  Promotion  Center in Chicago has moved aggres sively to fulfill its pledge to show what  American  business  can  do  in  the  region.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the report of the Chicago  Association of Commerce and Industry  be placed in the REcoRD at the close of  my remarks.  I urge my colleagues  to read  this  ~ concise  report,  that points out that   o CACI has already generated $6 million  in sales for Dominican Republic ex porters and $16 million in new investments in that country. These are enor mous accomplishments in only a year's  operation and certainly are  in  line  with the President's program.  AID knew that by coming to Illinois,  it was dealing with a professional orga nization, CACI.  Illinois  is  the  third  largest exporting State in the country.  Exporting is not a luxury in my home  State, but a way of life. Illinois busi ness and  labor know  that  it means  bread and butter. CACI's leadership Clayton Yeutter and Sam Mitchell have proven the ability of the private  sector to generate economic growth. I  am proud of these executives and the  others in Chicago that have made this  promise a  reality. The Nation owes  them their gratitude.  There being no objection, the report  was  ordered  to be printed  in  the  REcoRD, as follows:  CHICAGO AsSOCIATION OF COMMERCE AND IN DUSTRY  (CACI) CARIBBEAN BASIN PROMO TION C!:Nn:R (CBPC)  FIRST YEAR ACCOMPLISHMENTS  In October, 1982, the Agency for Interna tional Development <AID> entered  into a  Cooperative  .Agreement with  the Chicago  Association  of Commerce  and  Industry  <CACI> to create a special staff unit at the  Association dedicated to the promotion of  Caribbean investment and trade opportuni ties  in Chicago and throughout the Mid west. After a  three-mont(h start-up period,  this special unit, called the Caribbean Basin  Promotion Center <CBPC), began operating  in January of 1983.  The Chicago Association, which  is  the  largest regional Chamber of Commerce in  the United States,  accepted businesslike,  ""bottom line"" targets for its activities. Spe cifically, it agreed to discuss and negotiate  $20 million in investments and to develop  trade opportunities for six new products in  the Chicago  area  in  its  first  eighteen  months of operations. Although that time  period has not yet elapsed and although, at  AID's request, CACI focused its efforts ex clusively on the Dominican Republic until  late November 1983, these targets are well  in sight and are in the process of being met.  Specifically:  Six million  in actual sales activity has  been generated in Chicago for Dominican  Republic exporters. These sales are in jeans,  parochial school uniforms,  fruits, vegeta bles, cigars, rum, furniture and electronic  components, CACI expects many of these  sales to be repeated and many more are ""in  the pipeline"".  Contracts have been negotiated by Chica go firms for over $16 million in new invest ment  in  the Dominican Republic. The  CBPC staff has played an instrumental role  in bringing these contracts to signature. An other $8 million in specific investment deals  for the Dominican Republic are presently  being promoted.  The CBPC staff is encouraged by the in vestment and trade prospects it has devel oped for Costa Rica now that AID has ap proved  its starting operations  there. The  Center expects that its promotional activi ties will produce even greater dividends and in shorter period of time-in that coun try.  A professional approach  The CBPC has achieved tangible objec tives due to the professional and business like approach of its staff.  Its efforts to promote investments have  involved <1>  the preparation of economic  data and risk analysis, <2>  the sponsorship  of an investment seminar which attracted  over 300 Chicago area business executives,  and <3> numerous  investment missions  to  the Dominican Republic on which compa nies such as Digital Equipment Corporation,  Wilson Sporting Goods and the Hilton hotel  chain have been represented.  In promoting trade the CBPC has ""pound ed the pavements"" of chicago in order to de scribe the benefits of doing business with  Caribbean countries. The staff has attended  21 trade shows and conferences and is now  pursuing 150 specific leads for new trade ac tivities. CBPC staff pioneered the highly in novative and successful technique of spon soring an Export USA workshop in Santo  Domingo. In this program, fifteen front line  buyers from U.S. companies came to Santo  Domingo and spoke to over 600 potential  Dominican  exporters  about  the  require ments of  the U.S. market. Several  trade  deals were made during the workshop itself.  The CBPC estimates that it served over  2,000  businessmen,  both Caribbean  and  U.S., during its first year.  The Center's trade and investment promo tion activities are buttressed by an extensive  outreach efforts through publications and  other public information media. The Center  ",1984

1119,74,18,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, I had the  pleasure recently to be in Salt Lake  City during the American Legion Con vention.  At  that  time,  President  Reagan and our START Ambassador,  Ed Rowny, addressed the Legionnaires  concerning the national security and  arms control policies of  the United  States. Given the heated debate that  has been generated on these issues by  the Presidential election campaign,  believe it would be useful to have Am bassador Rowny's remarks printed in  the RECORD.  As my colleagues well know, Ambas sador Rowny has been involved in the  process of strategic nuclear arms con trol for more than a decade. He is an  extremely able negotiator who knows  well the challenge of negotiating with  the Soviets and is committed to secur ing an agreement that reduces the risk  of nuclear war and serves the national  security interests of our country.  let Ambassador Rowny's re marks  speak  for  themselves, but  would emphasize his theme that the  Reagan Administration is dedicated to  achieving real reductions in the nucle ar arsenals of both superpowers. We  have been flexible at the bargaining  table, and have worked with the Con gress in generating bipartisan support  for U.S. proposals. The United States  will not, however, accept an agreement  simply or agreement's sake;  in  the  words of Ambassador Rowny, ""*   I  want a solid agreement based on re duction, equality, and verifiability, I'm  not going to sell our country's security  short.""  Mr. President,  this administration  has a  good  record on arms control  issues, and there is hope that a good  agreement can be reached if the Sovi ets would  return  to  the bargaining  table. Ambassador Rowny's  speech  throws light on both these points, and  ask that his remarks be printed in  the RECORD.  The remarks follow:  I will  I  I    REMARKS oF AlmASSADOR EDwARD L. RoWNY  TO THE AliERICAN LEGION, SALT LAKE CITY,  UTAH  is  It is a great honor to be here today to talk  to you about the subject of strategic arms  control. As Legionnaries, no one knows  better than you the importance of preserv ing the peace. As President Reagan indicat ed here yesterday, one of his major foreign  policy goals  to reduce the risk of war  through substantial reductions in the U.S.  and Soviet nuclear arsenals. In seeking to  attain this goal, we have worked long and  hard, negotiating patiently, seriously and  flexibly. We will continue to strive to bring  about a peaceful world by reducing or ban those weapons which contribute  to  fear, danger and instability.

1148,113,18,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Speaker, my  very  esteemed  friend, Maj.  Gen.  Donald S. Dawson, gave the keynote  address at the Reserve Officers Asso ciation Convention in Chicago recent ly and spoke eloquently about the late  President Harry S. Truman, his devot ed friend. What he said is worthy of  wide reading and I, therefore, include  it here in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  Mr. President, distinguished guests, hon ored past presidents, ladies of the ROAL,  my fellow officers, I am highly honored to  have this invitation to take another early  morning walk with President Truman. Not  down Pennsylvania Avenue and up to the  Capitol this time, nor with the Secret Serv ice, but a stroll down memory lane, with one  of the great men of history-one who has  meant so much to ROA.  The Reserve Officers Association is dedi cating this convention to an outstanding Re serve Officer, Harry S. Truman, who rose  from National Guard private in 1905 to cap tain-on active duty in France in World War  I and then by Presidential election became  Commander-in-Chief  of  all  our Armed  Forces.  He was a preeminent example of the citi zen soldier-the example set by our first  President, George Washington.  Born in Lamar, Missouri, he grew to man hood on a Missouri farm near Independ ence. He was a farmer. His mother said he  could plow the straightest furrow in Jack son County, Missouri, and that was behind a  walking plow pulled by a mule-no high powered tractor.  During  the 1948 Presidential campaign  when he had literally been living on the  ""whistle-stop"" train, making a dozen speech es a day and shaking thousands of hands, I  asked him how he seemed so full of energy  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  and never tired of doing all the things we  put upon him, when his staff-much young er-was worn out.  After a moment's reflection he said. ""I  think it is because I was behind a plow at  the right time of life.''  He also knew the life of a small  town,  where he went to school and fell in love on  his first day at Sunday school, when he was  six, with the prettiest girl he ever saw and  later married after the war-a long court ship, one that was to last all of his life.  He worked as a railroad timekeeper. He  worked in the post office, in a drug store, as  a bank clerk in the big city-Kansas City,  tried his hand at oil well development,  which did not work out, and owned a small  haberdashery after the war with his buddy,  Eddie Jacobson, that went broke.  Many stores in the Midwest failed in that  advance tremor of the Great Depression, so  there was little mystery or shame. Indeed,  what struck most people was not his failure  but how he handled it. He refused to take  bankruptcy, as was commonly done, and  over the next 20 years he paid off some  $20,000 in haberdashery debts, down to the  dollar. He was still paying them off while he  was in the Senate, when the salary was only  $10,000 a year and when he could barely  made ends meet in Washington.  If there was one  turning point  in his  career, it was his success as an artillery offi cer in World War I. He need never have  gone to war. He has applied to West Point  and had been turned down because of poor  eyesight. He was past 30, and he was needed  on the family farm, where he had worked  for 11 years.  As Captain Harry Truman of the 129th  Field Artillery in France, he was a triumph,  as is plain in the record. His 1918 service  record says, ""This officer  is an excellent  Battery Commander. He is unusually well equipped and is an excellent instructor. He  is resourceful and dependable.""  He was put in command in France of an  unruly Kansas City unit, Battery D,  the  regiment's most troubled unit, more than  200 men who were mostly Irish who did not  go easy on any officer, let alone one in big  hom-rimmed glasses who still looked a lot  like a bank clerk. He was the fourth officer  in less than a year.  Truman later wrote, ""They called them selves the Irish Battery and it did sound as  if the Hibernians were meeting when the  roll was called, except that now and then,  along with the MeKims and Caseys and the  Donnellys, there'd be Schmidt and a Meis berger.""  The morning he  took over, he was as  frightened as he ever had been. ""I didn't  come here to get along with you,"" he told  the non-coms. ""You've got to get along with  me. And if there are any of you who can't speak up, and I'll bust you back now.""  At St. Mihiel and  the Argonne Forest,  through some of the heaviest fighting seen  by any American unit in the war, he proved  himself tough, courageous and consistently  popular. His men said: ""he was the boss of  the outfit.'' ""he not only commanded it, he  owned it."" ""We felt he knew what he was  doing.'' ""He was the best in the world."" ""on  firing problems we began to hit the target.""  After two months in France, his unit went  to the front-before they had finished their  training.  In the first shelling by the Germans, Vie  Householder saw Captain Truman's horse  go down, its belly tom open by shrapnel. He  rushed over and found Truman lying there  with only his upper chest and head sticking  24729  ranks on  driving Missouri  out from under the horse. They dragged  him out and he quickly recovered. Then,  using  language  learned  mules, he brought his men together. They  now saw him as a cool captain under fire,  and some even spoke of him as a good luck  piece for the battery.  On another occasion,  the enemy began  shelling Battery D's position. Three rounds  landed close and some nervous Nellie yelled,  ""Let's get out of here."" Several men ran  over Truman, knocking him into the mud as  he was coming out of his command dugout.  He jumped up, pulled his pistol and shout ed, ""Any SOB who isn't back in position in  ten seconds will be shot."" They made  it  back, and later called it the ""Battle of Who  Run.""  ""He was  tough, but he was  fair,"" said  Gene Donnelly. Some have gone so far as to  say, ""He was one of the kindest and most  thoughtful men I've ever known.""  After the war, he maintained a personal  relationship with each of the men in Bat tery D, which  lasted  through  the years.  Countless times I have seen him recollect  from memory where they were, what they  were doing, how their families were. He kept  a little black book in the left bottom drawer  of his Presidential desk in the Oval Office  with  the address of each, with personal  notes about them, that were up-to-date.  He was never too busy to see any of them  and enjoy old  times whenever  they hap pened to be in Washington or wherever he  was,  throughout the country. He attended  every  reunion,  even  as  President  and  marched  in  their ever-thinning  parade.  After  the war Captain Harry  became  Major Truman  in the Army Reserve, as signed to the 102nd Reserve Division. The  educational program he and his fellow re servists initiated served the Army for years  as a model reserve training program which  was used throughout the country. General  Harry Smith, Commanding Officer of the  VI Corps, addressing the Kansas City re serve officers commended the Kansas City  reservists as the ""best coordinated effort in  the nation.""  Truman became active  in the American  Legion and helped with the 1921 Conven tion in Kansas City. A few days after the  Convention,  he met with  several  other  World War I veterans and members of the  Officers Reserve Corps at Morton's Restau rant and decided to start a club of all re serve officers in the Kansas City Area-the  Reserve Officers Club  of Kansas City,  which became Kansas City Chapter No.1 of  ROA.  Harry Truman was Army: make no mis take about it. He loved the military from  boyhood. While he was President, he said at  a Medal of Honor presentation  that he  would rather have earned the medal himself  than be President. As President, he was con vinced of the vital necessity for universal  military training for all your youth. He lost  that fight to the Congress, but never his in terest in a strong reserve program, which he  knew was the force on which our country  must ultimately depend in time of national  emergency.  I said he rose from Private to Captain in  World War I, but he was never a Second  Lieutenant. In those days the men elected  their officers in the National Guard and he  was elected First Lieutenant. He later said,  when his political popularity was at a low  ebb, he did not know whether he could win  that election again.  ",1984

1152,126,18,Mr.  GARN.," Mr.  President,  last  evening,  the Senate overwhelmingly  voted, 89 to 3, to limit debate on the  motion to consider the so-called bank ing bill. In about 20 minutes, we shall  vote on the motion to proceed. I hope  that the result will be the same, that  the Senate will conclude that it is at  least fair  to have a bill before  the  Senate so that we can consider it.  Before I speak any more about the  bill, Mr. President, I should like to cor rect a statement that concerns some  people. It was in a UPI story. I quote  one paragraph.  from Utah  to  is  recog Even so, he said, lobbyists for the Amen can Banking Association and New York's  biggest banking firms-Clticorp and Chase  Manhattan-are out to kill it rather than  seek changes.  The correction I would like to see  made for the record is to say that the  American Banking Association  sup ports the bill. How that got  in the  story-I  thought  I was  very  clear  about meaning two banking firms who  had decided to try to kill the entire  bill.  As I read the list of all the organiza tions  that  support  the  bill,  even  though they may disagree with some  parts of it and wish to change it, the  American Banking Association was  one of  those  that should not have  been  included  in  the position with  Citicorp and Chase Manhattan.  Let me just say once again what has  been repeated several  times on  this  floor, and very eloquently by my col league  from Wisconsin  yesterday,  about a major part of this bill and why  I guess I am surprised that a couple of  banks  and  the  securities  industry  would say, ""If we cannot be guaran teed that we have our way on the pro visions we do not like, we will kill the  entire bill."" I think it might be useful  to point out what some of those other  parts are and what  they are doing.  When I called them greedy, I meant  it-1 repeat it again today-because of  their willingness to come out on the  floor and have those who favor their  position argue in favor of that posi tion. In the case of title X, I under stand why the Senator from New York  does not like title X. I understand why  those banks do not like title X. But we  can certainly resolve that issue on the  floor by debating  the substance of  that title and having an up or down  vote by the Senate.  But there are 11 titles to this bill.  We have not discussed any of them.  All we have talked about is title X pri marily. But we have amendments to  the Federal Reserve Act that are not  controversial, amendments to the Na tional Housing Act that are not con troversial, amendments to the Home owners' Loan Act of 1933, amendments  to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act,  leasing  authority  of  the  national  banks; we also have a  title of credit  union amendments, credit union loans  to homeowners, faithful performance,  membership officers, powers of  the  board of directors, nonparticipation in  the credit union, change in insurance  status, sunset of credit union conserva torship authority. These are not con troversial but important, very impor tant to the credit unions of this coun try. So here we have two New York  banks who say, ""We don't care about  all the credit unions in this country  and all of the millions of people who  have deposits  in  them. We are not  going to allow you to consider those  changes because we don't like title X.""  We have title III on bankers' banks  that are not controversial, helpful to  the whole banking industry  if those  are passed. We have consumer leases  and lease-purchase agreements. There  has been some controversy about that,  so we have some amendments to the  Consumer Credit Protection Act. So  they are saying, ""We don't care about  the consumers in this country involved  in leases. We are going to kill that sec tion, too.""  We also have a deposit availability  title, disclosure of  fund  availability  policies, interest on deposits, improved  clearing procedures. There has been a  lot of talk about banks delaying clearing of checks for a couple of weeks and  what that does to depositors and the  availability of their funds. We are cor recting some problems there as well.  But  the securities  industry and big  banks  in New York say, ""We don't  care about that, we don't care about  consumer protection."" They do not  care about all these other titles that  have been  referred  to by both  the  ranking minority Member and  I  as  noncontroversial.  I  just  thought  it  might  be  useful  to my  colleagues  before we vote to proceed with this bill  to know if we do not get it up and pass  it,  regardless of how we  resolve  the  four controversial issues by a vote of  the Senate, what is going to be tossed  out and why I have continually said  that if we could not have a compre hensive bill,  there would be no bill.  Never have I said it had to be my bill  exactly intact but a comprehensive bill  and not simply a  loophole closer, be cause the House bill is not even ad dressing many of these things. I do not  know why. There has been a  lot of  rhetoric that we ought  to do some thing about check-cashing policies and  so on. In the same section we have  civil liability, effect on check accept ance policies and other  laws. Most  people probably do not know this is all  in here. All we have been  talking  about is regional banking and munici pal revenue bonds, mortgage bank se curities and the South Dakota loop hole-a small part of the bill.  We also have credit deregulation and  availability on business and agricultur al credit, Federal credit unions. We  also are dealing with a highly impor tant situation of broker deposits. If  you look into many of the banks that  have failed  in  this country the  last  couple of years, you are going to find  that they had abnormally high per centages  of  their  deposit  base  in  broker deposits, some of them more  than 70 percent. That is hardly the  way to build a bank. So everybody has  agreed we  ought  to  do  something  about the misuse of broker deposits,  and we are doing something about it in  title VIII.  We have amendments to the Nation al Housing Act, amendments  to the  Federal Deposit Insurance Act.  Title IX deals with fraudulent use of  credit cards and debit cards. That has  been a concern to both the House and  the Senate and certainly to the con sumers of this country. The House is  anxious to have a bill on credit card  fraud. We are anxious  to have that  title passed. But again we are being  told by a couple New York banks and  the  securities  industry,  ""We  don't  really care about that title. We will  worry about credit-card  fraud some  other day.""  I do not want to extend this too far  and have anybody from what I have  said think the  impllcatloDB are that  ",1984

1155,152,18,Mr. PROXMIRE.," May I say to my  good friend from Illinois that I am de lighted and honored that I am cospon soring  this  important measure. It is  about time. I say to the Senator from  Illinois that he can come to Wisconsin  for any type of parade, if we vote this  bill,  and  the  citizens of Wisconsin  would be glad to carry him on their  shoulders  throughout  the  parade  route. This  is a wonderful proposal  and about  time.  I am  just unhappy  that I did not think about it 20 years  ago. It is something we should have  been doing all along. Not only is this a  lalapalooza,  to use  the word of my  good friend from Illinois, for the tax payers of Wisconsin, but I  think for  people throughout the country it is a  good idea.  What it means  is  it will stimulate  competition.  If the people and  the  businesses of illinois realize that they  can get those contracts if they come  after them, they will do  it. Unfortu nately, in our State, we get one-half of  1 percent of the Federal defense con tracts, although we pay about 2 per cent of the taxes and we have about 3  or 4 percent of the industry. So we are  getting, at the very best, one-quarter  of what we should get in defense con tracts. That  is  partly  because our  people  are  not  aggressive  enough.  They are not active enough; they do  not bid enough. But it is also because  there obviously  is a  tendency  back to the same old places, year after  year, to the great disadvantage of illi nois and Wisconsin, both of which  have serious unemployment problems,  both of which have industry that can  do the job, that have people who are  ready and willing to put in a full day's  to go  ",1984
1156,165,18,Mr. BUMPERS.," Mr. President, I am  pleased  today  to  join with Senator  BoREN as an original cosponsor of the  resolution  urging  the President  to  begin  immediate  consultations with  the Soviets for the purpose of giving  formal notification of the raising of  export limits set under the long term  grain agreement. With current grain  prices  severely  distressed,  greater  Soviet  purchases  throughout  fiscal  year 1985 may be the only significant  positive  event  affecting  our  grain  market.  For fiscal year 1984, this administra tion agreed to raise the export limit  from its negotiated level of 12 million  metric tons. Grain shipments to the  Soviet Union are projected to exceed  13.3 million metric tons by September  30 and the Soviets are attempting to  arrange as great a quantity as possible  for September delivery because of the  failure  of  this  administration  to  extend the LTA limits for next year.  Yet, if the Soviet grain harvest falls  below 170 million metric tons, as many  experts  are  suggesting,  then  the  United States has a golden opportuni ty to reestablish its major share of the  Soviet market. Current Soviet purchases of U.S. grain for delivery  in  fiscal year 1985 already amount to 8.3  million metric tons, and the purchases  could exceed 20 million metric tons nearly 12 million metric tons of com  and 8 million metric tons of wheat.  If Soviet imports total nearly 45 mil lion metric  tons,  as  expected,  the  United States has the opportunity to  capture just under 50 percent of the  Soviet market. Certainly, if Soviet pur chases peak at 50 to 55 million metric  tons, as projected on the high side, the  U.S. share will be even greater because  of  the  readily  available  surplus of  grain in the United States.  These expected purchases will only  be  possible  if  this  administration  heeds the President's campaign rheto ric and extends the limits on the long  term grain agreement. Formal assur ance will be necessary to promote ad ditional sales because of the distrust ful nature of the Soviets. If such an  assurance  is  immediately given,  the  United States may avoid driving the  Soviets into markets of competitor na tions.  I would also like again to urge the  administration to seek the inclusion of  rice in our long term grain agreement  with the Soviets. Currently, over 22  million hundredweight of  rice  is  in  Government storage, and the extreme ly low rice prices, as we move into rice  harvest,  assure  that millions more  hundredweight of rice will likely end  up in Government storage. A signifi cant contributing factor is the admin istration's failure to help us maintain  our foreign rice markets in the face of  foreign competition, and the inclusion  of rice in the LTA would help open a  major new market to our embattled  rice  farmers. Over  the  last  several  years Soviet imports of rice have aver aged 800,000 metric tons a year, and  none of  this  rice  comes  from  the  United States.  For the sake of our grain farmers,  many who are not likely to survive in  farming without drastic grain price  improvements, I urge the President to  raise the LTA limits, and I call on my  colleagues to help  impress upon the  President the severity of this need.e  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED  TELEVISION AND RADIO IN THE  SENATE  RANDOLPH AMENDMENT NO.  3754  <Ordered to lie on the table.>  Mr. RANDOLPH submitted an amend ment intended to be proposed by him  to the resolution <S.

1159,178,18,Mr. YOUNG of Missouri.," Mr. Speak er, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5607 authorizes  and directs the Librarian of Congress,  subject  to  the supervision and con struction authority of a Federal civil ian or military agency,  to construct  the Library of Congress Mass Book  Deacidification  Facility  within  75  miles of the U.S. Capitol at an estimat ed cost of $11.5 million.  Construction  of  this  facility will  allow  for  the deacidification of ap proximately 500,000  items of the Li brary of Congress' vast collection of  approximately 80 million items on an  annual basis. Currently, over 77,000  books of the Library's collection dete riorate to the extent that they can no  longer be used on an annual basis.  Mr. Speaker,  the Library of Con gress,  and  libraries  throughout  the  world, are facing an increasingly press ing problem, namely, the rapid dete rioration of their collections due  to  the unstable nature of paper produced  since around 1850.  Prior to the 1850's, paper was made  from cotton or linen rags, and it could  last for hundreds of years. By then,  however, the industrial revolution and  the  growing  demand  for  reading  matter called for a cheaper and more  plentiful source of paper. Technolo gists  discovered  their  new  paper  supply in the cellulose fibers from or dinary wood pulp. But untreated pulp  based paper was too absorbent to take  a sharp imprint, so chemicals must be  added to prevent the ink from running  and provide for the proper absorbency.  These chemicals, especially aluminum  sulphate, sooner or later combine with  moisture in the paper to form sulphu ric acid. This acid, which  forms at  varying rates on all books published  since 1850, is the direct cause of the  disintegration of books.  Mr. Speaker, 12 years ago  the Li brary of Congress' Preservation Re search and Testing Office undertook a  major program to  identify the most  universal  approach  for  deacidifying  books on a very large scale. This pro gram involved a systematic investiga tion of all known liquid and gas phase  deacidification processes and a study  of new possibilities. After much  re search and experimentation of vapor  phase deacidification, a process was  developed and patented  in 1976 by  chemists  in the Library of Congress  which arrests the degradation of paper  and  increases  the  life of books and  other library materials by a factor of 2  to 5 times. At present the effective life  for acid paper books is 30 to 40 years,  whereas this new process will extend  the life of books in the Library's col lections by 400 to 600 years. This proc ess based on vapor phased impregna tion of books with zinc, will neutralize  the acidity and leave a residue of zinc  carbonate to protect the paper from  further acid induced loss of strength.  Invention  of  this  deacidification  process  by  the Library's  chemists  began with tests in an ordinary pres sure cooker in the Library's Preserva tion Research and Testing Office. Fur ther successful tests with large num bers of books were conducted in facili ties of  the General Electric Co.  in  Valley Forge, PA. In 1982 and 1983,  the Library of Congress, in consulta tion with  the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration successfully  conducted a  large scale 5,000 volume  test and did smaller scale  testing in  order to refine the process.  The present proposed facility consists of twin vacuum chambers made  in a  rectangular shape to accommo date pallets  loaded with books. The  building  includes  staging  areas  for  book loading and unloading, a series of  rehumidification  rooms, and a  com plete developmental test facility which  has its own small DEZ test chamber  independent of the production system.  In addition, the building includes sup port facilities for maintenance, stor age, offices, heating and air condition ing. It is anticipated the Army Corps  of Engineers will construct the facility  for the Library of Congress.  The capital costs authorized by this  legislation  include $11.5 million  for  the construction of a new laboratory  building, equipment and related facili ties. The Army Corps of Engineers es timates that the building will cost $3.5  million; laboratory facilities and equip ment,  together with directly related  costs will total $8 million. Funds for  this activity are  included in the Li brary's fiscal year 1985 budget.  The Library of Congress enlisted the  support of the Army Corps of Engi neers in locating a suitable federally owned site for the facility. Consider ation was given  to existing facilities  which could be converted for use by  the Library of Congress, as well as the  construction of a new facility. Based  on the findings of the corps and the  Library  it was determined  that  the  most cost effective facility would be  one constructed at Fort Detrick which  is located approximately 50 miles from  the U.S. Capitol. This kind of arrange ment  is highly desirable because of  the  availability  of  engineering  and  maintenance services,  fire protection  and safety services, and security.  Enactment of this bill, together with  subsequent appropriations, will enable  the Library of Congress  to preserve  the Library's vast collection of books  from rapid and total disintegration. It  will also make it possible to preserve  these books in their natural and origi nal state, that magnificent product of  the printer's and publisher's art, the  hand held book. This ""first of a kind""  laboratory facility will be available not  only to the Library of Congress but to  the library and scholarly community  throughout the country, and for that  matter, throughout the world.  The Librarian of Congress is to be  commended for his outstanding lead ership in this matter.  Mr. Speaker,  I urge enactment of  H.R. 5607.  ",1984

1161,191,18,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H.R. 4901, the Comprehen sive Drug Penalty Act of 1984, and I  urge my colleagues to support this ur gently needed legislation.  Narcotics trafficking and drug abuse  is currently a criminal activity exceed ing $100 billion per year, with the Fed eral Government  spending  approxi mately $1 billion annually to interdict  illicit narcotics, to educate our citizens  on the dangers of drug abuse, and to  treat and rehabilitate  those  individ uals who are dependent upon or ad dicted to drugs. Drug traffickers obvi ously are making  enormous profits  and yet, under current law, the maxi mum fine for most serious drug of fenses is only $25,000.  One of the major objectives of H.R.  4901 would be to increase the maxi mum fine for convicted drug traffick ers from $25,000 to $250,000. In addi tion, it would establish an alternative  fine concept where drug offenders can  be fined up to twice their gross profits  or proceeds from drug trafficking ven tures  in cases where the alternative  fine would be greater than the fine  specified for the crime itself. The bill  would also establish a $10 million for feiture fund in the Department of Justice and the U.S. Customs Service. The  fund would be used to cover ever-in creasing costs of forfeiture procedures,  which are provided in the bill for all  felony drug cases, and to provide addi tional resources for law enforcement  activities in fiscal year 1985 through  1987.  Another  important aspect of  this  legislation would increase the narcot ics law enforcement activities of the  U.S. Customs Service. This is accom plished by increasing the current level  under which  administrative  rather  than  judicial  forfeiture  proceedings  can  be  initiated  from  $10,000  to  $100,000, and by removing the ceiling  entirely for merchandise and convey ances which are used to import, export  or store illicit substances. Such actions  will result in expedited action to avoid  deterioration and decreased value of  seized articles, as well as the enormous  cost of storage. The Secretary of the  Treasury would  be  authorized  to  transfer seized or forfeited property to  State or local agencies which seized or  participated in the seizure of the prop erty. Such action would greatly en hance  coordination and cooperation  among Federal, State and local agen cies  that  the Select Committee on  Narcotics Abuse and Control, of which  I am the Ranking Minority Member,  has found so seriously lacking.  Finally, H.R. 4901 would  increase  compensation  to  informers  from  $50,000  to $259,000, while  retaining  the current legal limit of such pay ments to 25 percent of the net pro ceeds.  Mr. Speaker, I commend the distin guished chairman of  the Judiciary's  Subcommittee  on  Crime  HUGHES],  for his  tireless  efforts  in  bringing this important legislation to  the floor of the House. Given the epi demic proportions of drug availability  and abuse  in  this country,  forceful  action is required and this legislation  does just that. Narcotics Select Com mittee hearings held around the coun try and  in Washington have clearly  demonstrated  that drug  availability  and drug abuse are increasing, while  the price to purchase deadly drugs is  decreasing. We must  take  strong  action to punish the drug traffickers  who are undermining our institutions  and who prey on and profit from the  misery of so many of our citizens. This  legislation is a step in that direction.  I would also like to take this oppor tunity to remind my colleagues that  increased  law  enforcement  efforts  must also be accompanied by increased  funding for drug education, treatment  and prevention programs, and in this  regard I urge that a portion of seized  drug assets be turned over to a drug  education,  treatment and prevention  fund.e  e ",1984
1162,191,18,Mr.  RANGEL.," Mr.  Speaker,  as  chairman of the Select Committee on  Narcotics Abuse and Control, I rise in  [Mr.  to  support of H.R. 4901, the Comprehen sive Drug Penalty Act of 1984. This is  an important piece of legislation de serving of support by every Member of  this House who is concerned about the  impact of drug abuse on their con stituents.  Today  the  financial  penalties  for  drug dealing are frequently only seen  by dealers as a cost of doing business.  Under current law, the maximum fines  for many serious drug offenses is only  $25,000. A major purpose of H.R. 4901  is to increase the use of forfeiture pro ceedings and criminal finds to attack  the phenomenal financial base of the  drug trade.  H.R. 4901 contains several salutary  provisions designed  increase  the  penalties imposed on drug traffickers,  including the following:  Substantially  increases  the maxi mum  permissible  criminal  fines  in  drug  cases,  generally  tenfold  from  $25,000 to $250,000, and establishes a  new alternative  fine  concept under  drug offenders can be  fined up  to  twice  their gross profits or proceeds  from drug trafficking where the alter native fine would be greater than the  fine specified for the crime itself.  Provides criminal  forfeiture provi sions in all felony drug cases.  Establishes a $10 million forfeiture  fund in the Department of Justice and  the U.S. Customs Service  to help  defray escalating costs associated with  forfeiture procedures and provide ad ditional resources to be used for law  enforcement in fiscal years 1985, 1986,  and 1987.  Creates a permissive presumption in  criminal cases  that all property ac quired by drug offenders during the  period of  the violations or  shortly  thereafter is subject to forfeiture if no  other likely source for such property  exists.  The U.S. Customs Service plays an  important role in the enforcement of  U.S. narcotics laws. Title II of H.R.  4901 contains provisions designed  to  increase the drug enforcement effec tiveness of the Customs Service.  Under current law,  judicial forfeit ure proceedings must be used in all  cases where the value of the seized  property exceeds $10,000, even though  most cases are uncontested. This re sults in significant delays of up to 2  years during which  time  the seized  property  frequently deteriorates  re sulting  in a  substantial decrease  in  value. H.R. 4901 authorizes the use of  administrative  rather  than  judicial  forfeiture proceedings in many more  cases by increasing the current admin istrative  ceiling  from  $10,000  $100,000 for most articles, and by re moving the ceiling entirely for prohib ited merchandise  and  conveyances  which  are used  to  import,  export,  transport, or store any controlled sub stance.  to  ",1984

1164,204,18,Mr. MOORHEAD.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in support of H.R. 5645 which  would eliminate most of the existing  civil priorities. Over the past 200 years  various Congresses have acted in an ad  hoc and random fashion to grant pri ority to particular and diverse types of  civil cases. Unfortunately, so many ex pediting provisions have been added  that it is impossible for the courts to  intelligently categorize cases.  When  this proposal was originally  introduced, approximately 40 expedit ing provisions had been located. As a  result of a further computer assisted  search by the Library of Congress and  Federal Judicial Center, an additional  40 priority provisions have been locat ed.  This bill wipes  the slate clean of  such priorities with certain narrow ex ceptions. The courts  are  instructed  under the bill to give appropriate pri ority  to  criminal  cases  and habeas  corpus cases, because of the involve ment of personal liberty. In addition,  the courts are directed to give priority  treatment to cases that involve either  applications for temporary restraining  orders or preliminary injunctions or to  any other cases where good cause has  been demonstrated. Moreover, because  every  congressional  corpmittee  as sumes that actions involving their ju risdiction are the most important, it is  virtually impossible to reconcile com peting priorities among  the  tens of  provisions.  H.R. 5645 which is supported by the  administration,  the  Judicial Confer ence,  the American Bar Association,  and the Bar of the city of New York  represents an important court reform  initiative and  I urge my colleagues'  support for it.e  ",1984

This bill modifies  the ""first sale"" doctrine as embodied  in section 109(a) of the Copyright Act  to require authorization of the copy right owners  in  a  sound  recording  before that recording may be commer cially rented. It involves no cost to the  Federal Government.  Under existing law, a phonorecord of  a copyrighted sound recording may be  commercially rented without the per the  copyright owners.

1173,217,18,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5519 is a bill tore authorize and amend the Indian Fi nancing Act of 1974. This act created  four programs. Title I authorized the  United States to issue direct loans to  Indian and Indian tribes from a revolv ing loan fund. Title II authorized the  United States to provide Federal guar antees on loans made to Indians and  Indian  tribes. Title  III allowed  the  United States to provide interest subsidies on  these guaranteed loans, and  title  IV, created an Indian Business  Grants Program. Since title I does not  need to be reauthorized, the bill ad dresses itself to titles II, III, and IV.  The purpose of the Indian Financing  Act is to provide credit that is not oth erwise available to Indians and Indian  tribes from private money markets. In  providing capital on a  reimbursable  basis, it is hoped that Indians will be  better able  to utilize  their own  re sources and achieve economic self -suf ficiency and self-determination.  Mr. Speaker, Indian reservations are  suffering from chronic unemployment  and are among the poorest areas of  this country. One of the biggest prob lem is the lack of capital necessary to  begin economic development. This act  has worked well  in the past and al though it is far from a comprehensive  solutions to the problems facing reser vations  today,  its  reauthorization  would provide an opportunity to many  Indian tribes and Indian individuals so  that economic self-sufficiency and eco nomic development have a  fighting  chance to be transposed from concepts  to reality. Therefore, I urge the pas sage of H.R. 5519 by the House.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. Speaker, I request  to use as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 5519, the Indian Financing Act  Amendments of 1984.  The Indian Financing Act of 197 4  was landmark legislation designed to  provide for Federal, Indian, and pri vate sector cooperation and funding to  develop Indian reservation economies.  The programs established by that act  have directly contributed to the cre ation of hundreds of successful busi nesses  and  thousands  of  jobs  on  Indian reservations in desperate need  of economic development.  Over the past 10 years, $41 million  appropriated  to  the  revolving  loan  fund established by the act has gener ated over $80 million in loan activity.  The loan guaranty and interest subsi dy program which would be extended  by H.R. 5519 has been the key factor  in bringing over $100 million in private  capital  to  reservation-based business  enterprise.  H.R. 5519 amends the 1974 act  to  adjust its provisions to changes in the  national economy and  to expand fi nancing opportunities to individual In dians. It also provides for additional  management and technical assistance.  I might add, Mr. Speaker, the tech nical assistance  is much required on  the reservations today, and on many  of the reservations  there  is not the  kind of technical expertise that must  be utilized in order to take advantage  of this legislation.  H.R. 5519 has the support of virtual ly all Indians, Indian tribes, and orga nizations. As  amended,  it  includes  most of the modifications to the origi nal text that were recommended by  the administration. H.R. 5519 is entire ly  consistent with  the  President's  Indian policy, which emphasizes the  need for reservation economic develop ment through cooperative efforts by  Indians, the Federal Government, and  the private sector.  The other body has passed a com panion bill by unanimous consent.  It is all too apparent that there is  great need for continued Federal sup port for economic development efforts  on Indian reservations.  0 1520  H.R. 5519 provides that support. It is  meritorious legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.  Mr.  Speaker, many  of  our  col leagues may have seen in the last few  days articles in the Washington Post  which dramatically  and  graphically  described  the  economic  conditions  which exist on some of our reserva tions.  There are many actions  that  the  Congress needs to take in order to ful fill its obligations to our Indian tribes.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is only  one of many, but certainly an impor tant one.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of my  colleagues for this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the bal ance of my time.  ",1984

1182,230,18,Mr. WYLIE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the amendment to S. 2819.  In almost 18 years  in Congress,  I  have seen few pieces of legislation that  were perfect on the first draft and  questions often arise before the final  product is brought before the House.  Most of the time differences between  the House and Senate are ironed out  in  a  conference  between  the  two  Bodies.  Last fall we didn't have the luxury  of a conference on our housing bill.  The situation was such that we had to  pass an IMF bill. Part of the package  we agreed-include was a housing bill  that was constructed without the ben efit of a formal conference.  Mr. Speaker, in assessing the impact  of that housing bill, it was clear that  certain provisions were not working as  we had thought. Viewed as a whole,'  these are not major matters. On the  other hand,  in some circumstances,  and  in certain  localities,  these are  indeed major matters. An example of  that is the problem some urban coun ties  experienced  in  spending  their  CDBG funds. Many of my colleagues,  including the gentleman from Penn sylvania  [Mr. WALKER]  have  ap proached me and asked that we pass  legislation correcting a  flawed provi sion in last year's act on the CDBG  Program. Well, here it is.  fact, Mr.  Speaker, what we  present here is an attempt to correct  all the faults we could identify that  are noncontroversial. The other body  has already passed their version. We  have an amendment which I support.  Our amendment is somewhat longer  but that  is misleading. Almost one half of the text of this amendment  has nothing to do with last year's bill.  Changes are made in other housing  laws under our committee's jurisdic tion but they are truly technical in  nature. They correct out-of-date cita tions or Department positions that no  longer exist. It is simply an attempt to  correct the text of our laws so that  when a new version of the compiled  laws is printed later this year it will  not contain out dated references.  The  changes we  domake  to  last  consequential. They have been develyear's bill are, for the m.ost part, inIn  235  oped in consultation with the adminis tration and the other body. There are,  however, a few provisions that are not  favored by the administration. One ex tends  the  section  Subsidized  Homeownership Program for another  year. The administration is opposed to  this program. So am I. On the other  hand, the agreement that was reached  last year did extend the program and I  believe we should live up to our agree ment. In addition, the funds have al ready been appropriated. Another pro vision opposed by the administration  would allow certain cities  to  retain  urban renewal income. The other body  added an amendment to existing law  that could be broad ranging. In excess  of 150 projects would have been effect ed. We have severely limited the appli cation of  that amendment.  In fact,  projects in only two cities are now cov ered. The cost could be as low as $10  million as opposed to $236 million if  all projects were included.  There were  also  questions  raised  about the 202 Program and some of  the Farmers Home provisions. None of  these, however, could in any way be  construed as budget busters. The ob jection lies more  in philosophy and  even OMB admits there are two inter pretations on these matters.  Mr. Speaker, in the other portions of  the bill there are some very laudatory  changes. I have already briefly men tioned  that part of  the amendment  that deals with urban counties and the  principally benefiting rule. Last year,  as you know, we attempted to further  target community development funds  by requiring them to be spent either  on low-and moderate-income families  or in areas where low-and moderate income individuals are in the majority.  We provided an exception but the ex ception was so narrowly drawn that it  had the effect of forcing urban coun ties to spend all their funds in one or  two  very  small  geographical  areas  while larger but deserving areas were  prohibited from receiving funds. This  certainly was not our intention and I  am gratified that we are clearing this  up with this amendment.  In addition, the amendment clarifies  a provision in last year's bill dealing  with  attendant  care  costs  allowed  under the new definition of income. As  a  result of  this amendment, handi capped residents of assisted housing  would be permitted  to deduct from  their income attendant care and spe cial  transportation  costs  such  as  wheelchairs  and  specially modified  vans.  I might also mention an amendment  to the Farmers Home Administration  section. Many of my colleagues will re member the problem that arose earlier  this year when funds for the Farmers  Home Administration 502 Homeowner ship Program. were not being spent be cause of an adm.inistrative interpretation. Last year's bill targeted 40 percent of the 502  funds for very  low  income  families. When,  for various  reasons, the full 40 percent of those  funds could not be utilized in some  States, the Department of Agriculture  refused to spend the 60 percent of the  remaining  funds. These were  funds  that were to go to low-income families.  The Department claimed a linkage be tween the two. We were able to sever  the link for this year in an appropria tion bill. This amendment will take  care of the problem for future years.  Mr. Speaker,  this  legislation does  have merit  and  is  of  a  technical  nature. It contains no new grandiose  programs and has been approved by  both the majority and the minority. I  hope my colleagues will suspend the  rules and pass S. 2819 as amended.  ",1984

1184,230,18,Mr. SISISKY.," Mr. Speaker, I under stand  that  these  technical  amend ments are simply correcting oversights  of the Housing and Urban-Rural Re covery Act of last year and therefore a  matter of importance  to my district  has not been included. That matter is  maintaining the community develop ment block grant [CDBGl entitlement  status of those communities which lost  their status as central cities after the  last census. As I understand it, 19 com munities under 50,000 no longer meet  the definition of central city of a met ropolitan area and therefore will not  be entitled for CDBG funding after  fiscal year 1985. For the first  time,  studies of commuting patterns were  used  to  identify central cities,  and  these cities were dedesignated because  they do not attract enough workers.  Since attracting workers is a key to a  healthy  and vibrant  economy,  this  methodology has eliminated some very  distressed and struggling communities,  which are very much in need of CDBG  funding. One of  these communities,  the city of Hopewell, VA, is in my dis trict. I am also speaking on behalf of  my colleague, Mr.  liEPNER of North  Carolina, who represents the commu nities of Concord and Salisbury, NC,  which are also affected by this change.  Mr. Speaker, I can appreciate that in  the crush of business the committee  has limited its considerations this year  to matters of immediate concern, but  could you assure me that when the  committee considers legislation in the  next Congress, it will review the situa tion of these small cities as the com mittee conducts hearings and marks  up the legislation?

Mr. Speaker,  I want  to commend  both  the  chairman,  the gentleman  from Florida [Mr. FASCELL] and the  gentleman from Iowa [Mr. LEAcH] for  the leadership roles  that they have  played in bringing this issue of torture  to the forefront.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support  House Joint Resolution 605,legislation  regarding U.S. policy in opposition to  the practice of torture by any foreign  government.  Millions of  individuals  throughout  the world experience acts of cruelty  too brutal to imagine. They are victim ized by their governments, the very in stitution which should protect them.  In addition to the inhumanities these  people have  to  endure,  they must  endure yet another obstacle-the un willingness on the part of well-mean ing people outside of their government  to  look at or  listen  to  their story.  Seeing proof of torture is too difficult  for many to face, but face it we must.  The  Subcommittee  on  Human  Rights  and  International Organiza tions, which I chair, held a series of  hearings on the phenomenon of tor ture. Thanks to the efforts of Amnesty  International  and various other  human rights organizations, we were  able  to  look closely at this heinous  crime, to see how it affects human life,  and to plan specific actions to combat  this cruelty.  Torture  is  a brutal and powerful  enemy. We can combat and ultimately  defeat this horrifying practice by sup porting  positive measures  such  as  House Joint Resolution 605. Our fight  to eradicate  this universal  tragedy,  torture, must be a continual and deter mined one. We in the United States  have been spared the endless agony  torture victims throughout the world  are realizing, but we have not been  spared  the responsibility of fighting  against this injustice.

Mr. Speaker, let me just say in re sponse to the gentleman from Penn sylvania [Mr. YATRON], if I may, that I  would like to commend the gentleman  and his subcommittee for their contin ued interest, dedication and persever ance they have shown on all of these  human rights subjects. It is so easy to  either be frustrated or just to say that  they are motherhood  issues and we  should not  even be bothered with  them. The truth of the matter is that,  as with  torture, violation of human  rights are pernicious and our best de fense  is  to expose  them. We must  make it possible for these issues to be  discussed openly and  try  to shame  people  into  changing  their actions.  There is no such thing as official tor ture; it is always done very clandes tinely. It takes the kind of action that  the subcommittee has taken with re spect to hearings, and that this Con gress will take in passing the resolu tion, to call attention to problems that  most people do not think really exist.  LEVINE  of California. Mr.  Speaker, I am pleased to join .my col leagues in support of House Jomt Res olution 605, which reaffirms that it is  the continuing policy of the U.S. Gov ernment to oppose the practice of tor ture by foreign governments through  public and private diplomacy. I would  like  to  commend  the distinguished  Chairman of the House Committee on  Foreign Affairs, on which I sit, for in troducing  this  important  resolution  and for bringing it to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, article 1 of the Decla ration Against Torture, adopted unani mously by the United Nations on De cember 9, 1975, defines torture as:  e Mr.  Any act by which severe pain or suffering,  whether physical or mental, is intentionally  inflicted by or at the instigation of a public  official on a person for such purposes as ob taining from him or a third person informa tion or confession. punishing him for an act  he has committed, or intimidating him or  other persons.  The definition also says that torture  constitutes an aggravated and deliber ate form of cruel, inhuman or degrad ing treatment or punishment.  Torture can take almost any form.  In fact, it is limited only by the imagi nation, and people all over the world  have been subjected  to mental and  physical cruelty of such proportions  that it nearly defies comprehension by  humane and civilized people.  Amnesty International, a highly re spected organization with which we  are all  familiar,  issued a  report  in  April titled ""Torture in the Eighties.""  This report contains everything you  need to know about the practice of  torture  in  the world. Torture,  this  report tells us, is usually part of the  state-controlled machinery  that sup presses dissent. It is practiced in more  than 60 countries in the world-more  than a  third of the world's govern ments. Torture knows no  ideological  bounds, and victims of torture include  virtually all social classes, age groups,  trades and professions. Reasons differ  for why people are tortured, but there  is  no  question  that whatever  the  reason, or the method, torture is a vi cious, heinous practice, and one which  must be condemned and condemned in  the strongest terms.  There appears to be an increasing  awareness of the practice of torture.  The United Nations and other inter governmental organizations and sever al  nongovernmental  organizations  have worked to develop international  standards against torture and machin ery  to  combat  its  use. A  growing  number of  domestic  human  rights  groups are working in their own coun tries  to document and publicize  tor ture used by their governments. The  news media carry many more news  items about torture and other human  rights abuses than they did a decade  ago.  With  the passage of House Joint  Resolution 605 the Congress itself will  go on record as taking a strong stand  against the practice of torture and in  support of enactment and vigorous im plementation of laws intended to rein force U.S. policies with respect to tor ture. With the passage of the resolu tion before us the U.S. Government  clearly declares that it opposes acts of  torture wherever they occur, without  regard to ideological or regional con siderations, and  that we will make  every  effort  to work  cooperatively  with other governments and with non governmental organizations to combat  the practice or torture worldwide.  It is important that a country like  the United States, with our long histo ry of respect for human rights and the  freedom of our own citizens and of  citizens  everywhere-support  the  policy declared  in  this  resolution.

1191,256,18,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. Speaker, H.R.  5464, would establish a National Wild life Refuge consisting of several small  islands and a barrier beach along the  Connecticut coast. These  islands are  valuable habitat for a number of spe cies of wildlife, most notably herons,  terns, and other shore and wading  birds. The refuge would become part  of  the  National Wildlife  Refuge  System and would be managed by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service pursu ant to the National Wildlife Refuge  System Administration Act of  and other applicable statutes. The leg islation contains an authorization of  $2.5 million  for  acquisition of  the  refuge.  Mr. Speaker, the areas that would be  included  in  the National Wildlife  Refuge System following the passage  of this legislation will be worthy addi tions to a system that now includes  over  national wildlife  refuges.  Chimon  Island,  the  largest of  the  areas that would be included, supports  Connecticut's most significant heron  rookery and one of the largest wading  bird colonies on  the northern  sea board.  Falkner's  Island,  currently  owned by the Coast Guard, supports  Connecticut's only breeding popula tion of roseate terns and most of the  nesting population of common terns.  1966  400  Milford Point is one of the few nesting  areas remaining for the piping plover  and other shore birds. Sheffield Island  also has great potential as habitat for  shore and wading birds.  The legislation was amended in com mittee to change the name of the pro posed refuge to the Connecticut Coast al National Wildlife Refuge to reflect  the fact  that the refuge contains a  number of units along the Connecticut  coast.  H.R. 5464 also includes a provision  to clarify the use of funds appropri ated to the Fish and Wildlife Service  under  the Supplemental Appropria tions Act, recently signed by the Presi dent, to acquire lands within the At chafalaya Basin in Louisiana. That act  appropriated $10 million to the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service to acquire  lands under the Fish and Wildlife Act  of 1956 and other authority.  For those of you not familiar with  Louisiana,  the Atchafalaya Basin  is  one of the great natural areas of this  Nation. It is essentially a huge river  swamp,  encompassing  more  than  500,000 acres of wetlands  that may  produce as much wildlife as any area  in the country. It is home to an aston ishing diversity of wildlife,  including  herons, egrets, and other wading birds;  mallards, wood ducks, and countless  other waterfowl;  black bears,  deer,  bobcat, muskrat, and other mammals;  and  countless  alligators.  From  its  wasters comes the Louisiana crawfish,  an indispensable part of cajun cuisine,  as well as bass, catfish, and other fish.  The debate over conservation of the  Atchafalaya Basin has been going on  for years in Louisiana. Flood control,  agriculture,  energy  development,  recreation. and other interests in the  basin were difficult to reconcile. Re cently, however, all of the parties in volved developed an agreement that  resolves  the major  disputes.  The  agreement, which is incorporated in a  plan developed by the Corps of Engi neers for the basin, specifies flood con trol measures, water flow  rates, and  the purchase of flowage easements de signed to keep the basin in a natural  state while providing flood protection  for surrounding communities.  The plan also calls for the acquisi tion and management of 90,000 acres  within the basin for public access. The  Dow Chemical Co. has donated 40,000  acres. The acquisition of the remain ing 50,000 acres is to be split between  the State of Louisiana and the Federal  Government. All of the public access  lands are to be managed by the State  of Louisiana. The State has recently  purchased approximately 10,000 acres  and has plans  to acquire additional  lands in the near future.  Authorization for  the  implementa tion of the comprehensive plan for the  Atchafalaya, including the acquisition  of public access lands by the Corps of  Engineers, is included in the water resources legislation that has passed the  House.  The provision relating to the Atcha falaya  included  in H.R. 5464 simply  clarifies how  the Service  is  to use  funds contained in the fiscal year 1984  Supplemental  Appropriation  Act.  Lands acquired will become part of the  national wildlife  refuge  system but  will be managed by the State under a  cooperative agreement with the Fish  and Wildlife Service. The National  Wildlife Refuge Administration Act  requires that refuges are to be admin istered by the Secretary of the Interi or through the Fish and Wildlife Serv ice. However,  it would make  little  sense to split the management respon sibilities of the basin between Federal  and State agencies. Since the State is  already managing in excess of 50,000  acres in the basin, it is only sensible  that they should be the management  authority. It is our  intent that the  area be managed by the State in a  manner consistent with the provisions  of the National Wildlife Refuge Ad ministration Act and other applicable  statutory authority.  The  legislation,  as  amended,  also  provides that the area is to be consid ered as part of the refuge system for  the purposes of the Refuge Revenue  Sharing Act. This act provides in lieu  of tax payments to local governments.  This is consistent with the policy for  other refuges managed under coopera tive agreements, such as Matagorda  Refuge in Texas.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to con gratulate  the members of  the Con necticut delegation, al of whom co sponsored  this  legislation and all of  whom have worked diligently to assure  its passage. Through their efforts, we  will protect one of the few remaining  natural  areas  in  Connecticut  for  future generations.e   ",1984
1192,256,18,Mrs. KENNELLY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in strong support for H.R. 5464,  the Connecticut and Louisiana wildlife  refuge bill. This legislation establishes  a Connecticut Coastal National Wild life Refuge on Chimon Island, Milford  Point, Faulkner's Island, and Sheffield  Island in the State of Connecticut. In  addition,  the  legislation directs that  Public Law 98-396 lands in the Atcha falaya Basin in Louisiana be included  in the national wildlife refuge system.  The wildlife refuge proposed in this  bill is important to the State of Con necticut. Our State, in the middle of  the Boston-New York  corridor,  is  highly urbanized, the cost of land is  high and open spaces are at a premi um.

1194,269,18,Mr. GONZALEZ.,"  I  thank my col league from Kentucky, as well as our  distinguished chairman, Mr. NATCHER,  your colleague  from Kentucky,  for  this opportunity to evoke the memory  of CARL PERKINs. He was certainly a  great Congressman and a great Ameri can who has been called  to death's  dateless night.  It seems strange to be here evoking  that memory. It just seems as if CARL  PERKINS is still among us. Those of us  that had worked with CARL, had been  blessed with his  friendship,  I  think  share that feeling  that death really  has very little meaning when it comes  to  the case of a CARL PERKINS. His  spirit certainly hovers here even now.  Even in this area where you, the dis tinguished Members from Kentucky,  and  some  of  us would  congregate  during a  rollcall or during a heated  debate.  When we do evoke, reverentially, the  memory of  this great American,  I  think one must stress the fact  that  CARL PERKINs was a wise man to know,  and very bold to perform. Here was a  man that over the span of three dec ades served his constituents; upheld  his sworn oath of office  faithfully,  honorably, and most effectively. At  the same  time, he  transcended that  purely  local, parochial  responsibility  and  served  every  single  nook  and  cranny of this Nation who had any  kind of education need.  I,  for one, for  instance, must give  testimony to the debt we have to CARL  PERKINs  in our areas. We have great  dependency on  those very programs  that CARL PERKINS initiated, authored  and worked desperately hard over a  period of 30 years to erect and con struct as national policy.  ",1984
1195,282,18,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker, the Con gress is lesser today with the passing  of Congressman CARL D. PERKINS.  CARL PERKINS was a man of wisdom,  skill, and compassion. As  a  former  member pf the Education and Labor  Committee, I quickly came to admire  and respect this slow-talking, unobtru sive Kentuckian as a shrewd and effec tive legislator who remained unswerv ingly devoted  to  the highest princi ples.  But it is not only the Congress that  has suffered with his passing. The  people of Kentucky have lost a friend  who rose from their ranks and who  always remained committed  to  their  needs and their views. And students,  workers, and poor people across Amer ica have lost an invaluable ally who  stood for them when others would not.  Under the leadership of CARL PER KINS,  the Education and Labor Com mittee produced some of the most im portant and far-reaching social legisla tion this country has ever known. Less  than a year after assuming the com mittee chairmanship in 1967, he shep herded President Johnson's antipover ty program through the House with out major alteration. His other impor tant successes included the Vocational  Education Act of 1965 and the Appa lachian Regional Development Act of  1965. Millions of Americans have di rectly benefited from his work, includ ing coal miners with black lung dis ease, lower-and middle-income college  students, Social Security and medicare  beneficiaries, and children who partici pate in school feeding programs.  During the first years of thP. Reagan  administration,  CARL  PERKINs  saw  many of his most important achieve ments offered up as sacrifices on the  budget-cutting  altar.  I  shared  his  sense of frustration and outrage as the  progressive  achievements  of many  years  suffered devastating  cutbacks  that resulted  in nothing but misery  and hardship, and I joined him in his  attempts to salvage and rebuild these  programs into what they were meant  to be. With the passing of CARL PER the cause of compassion and  fairness has been deeply wounded.  On this sad occasion, I wish to ex press my profound sorrow at the loss  of my  cherished  colleague  and  to  extend my deepest sympathies to the  KINS,  family,  friends,  and constituents of  CARL D. PERKINS.e  e Mr. HARRISON, Mr. Speaker, last  month the board of the Association of  Urban Universities received a  report  from  its Washington  director,  Jim  Harrison, entitled ""Crossing Trouble some Creek."" That report was in the  nature of a eulogy for our departed  colleague, CARL D. PERKINS. It merits  inclusion in today's REcoRD for its in sight into the late great chairman:  CROSSING TROUBLESOME CREEK  and will  As I am sure most of you have heard by  now, Carl Dewey Perkins, Member of Con gress from  the 7th District of Kentucky,  and 17 years Chairman of the House Com mittee on Education and Labor, died on  August 3rd.  The commonplace observation will be that  education, or labor, or the people of the  Kentucky hills, or the coal miners have lost  a friend. And all these commonplaces will be  accurate. The sophisticated observer of the  Congressional scene will supplement those  observations by remarking on Carl Perkins'  ""shrewd use of parliamentary procedure"" or  his ""seniority-based  influence""  to explain  his monumental record of legislative accom plishment. I hope that those who, as I do,  love Carl  Perkins  honor  his  memory forever, will not take it amiss if I  suggest that those journalistic shortcuts are  mostly nonsense.  Carl Perkins was not a student of the mi nutiae of parliamentary procedure, <though  he knew well how the House functioned),  nor was his unquestioned influence engen dered by some kind of unthinking respect  for seniority <though only two other present  Members of  the House have  served  the  House longer than he>.  No, when Carl Perkins won a  legislative  battle against the odds, when he whipped  an unfriendly Administration, insolent bu reaucrats and tough and sophisticated pres sure groups (and he did all of that a lot>, he  unually did so because he was usually right!  One of my fondest memories of Carl Per kins, as a parliamentarian, was that of a full  Committee markup some years ago on a  Black Lung bill. The chairman had moved  an amendment to make it easier for those  suffering from black lung to demonstrate  that a  lifetime spent in the bowels of the  Kentucky earth had some connection with  the shortness of  their breath-and  their  lives.  One of Mr. Perkins' distinguished col leagues, opposed to the amendment, made a  very eloquent, a very  learned and,  to be  honest about it, a logically and legally im peccable argument  that  the amendments  were out of order. Mr. Perkins presided over  the discussion with the gentle patience and  good humor which were his trademark. He  offered no parliamentary rebuttal, probably  because there was none. He had made his  case earlier on the facts of the tormented  lives black lung sufferers know.  When his colleague ended listing the cita tions, analyzing the precedents and quoting  the cases, Chairman Perkins simply said  ""The gentleman may well be right. Is there  There was none, of course. In the silence  that ensued, as the Chairman waited pa tiently for objection,  it became perfectly  clear that no one could bring himself to  fight against Carl Perkins' compassion for  objection  ments?""  to  the adoption of my amendthe dying on the basis of parliamentary con siderations alone.  Similar, perhaps  less well encapsulated  stories can be told about Carl Perkins' life long effort to bring education to the educa tionally deprived, school lunches to hungry  children, student assistance  to  those  for  whom college had never been even a dream,  safety in the mines and construction sites  and-the list is  long and moving. He did  what he needed to do to accomplish what a  nation needed to have done.  Another commonplace I have noticed in  the obituaries is that much of what Carl  Perkins did is ""no longer fashionable"". Un fashionable may be the mot juste, but it was  a never a word  to bother Carl Perkins.  Those whose compassion begins and ends  with the tax returns of the very-well-to-do  may find a concern for the necessitous and  a penchant for wearing white socks and  brown shoes on the House floor to be equal ly unfashionable. And those gentlemen may  well be right. But the Recording Angel will  probably spend more  time looking at the  statute books than at Carl's socks.  There are two kinds of legislators-and we  need both of them. There are those-you  know some of them-who will appeal con vincingly  to your  intellect,  jabbing  their  index finger into your chest as they make  each statistically unassailable point. And  there are those who will fold you in one  great arm, hugging you to their great heart,  while simply relying on your sense of decen cy. The world's intellect often needs to be  prodded by the jabbers. But enough can be  enough. In the long run, it is the buggers  who do the great things. In the long run,  they are irresistible.  I have tried, in these pages, to sum up a  man who defies summation. Could it be that  he was just not complex enough to be easily  characterized and filed away? Perhaps the  closest anyone has come  to a definitive  statement came from one of his neighbors  back home.  Carl was buried just across Troublesome  Creek,  in Knott County, Kentucky. Hun dreds of his  colleagues,  political  figures  whose lives had touched his, labor leaders,  educators, and the people of the hills came  to  the  funeral.  It was,  according  to  the  Troublesome Creek Times, the biggest such  event in Knott County history. The front  pages and editorial pages of the Trouble some Creek Times were filled with the usual  quotes from the usual notables. But in the  back pages, where for years, Bertha Gay heart and Daisy Hall and Martha Baldridge  have reported about the lives of their neigh bors in Garner and Beaver Creek and Caney  and Red Fox and Mousie, they all paused  among  their account of  the births and  deaths and church socials, to comment on  how their neighborhoods were affected by  Carl's life.  Bertha Gayheart  said  this:  ""Carl was  raised poor just like the rest of us, but he  never got above his raising."" In the press  galleries and cocktail parties, this could be  taken as a put-down. God knows  it was  not.e   ",1984

1198,308,18,Ms.  SNOWE.," Mr. Speaker,  1984  marks  the  lOth anniversary of  the  Senior Companion Program. This pro gram reflects a long-standing tradition  of voluntarism in this country but is,  nevertheless, unique in that it puts to  use the valuable talents and contribu tions of approximately 5,000 older vol unteers who are working in over 90  Senior Companion Programs  across  the country.  The  Senior Companion  Program  provides a stipend volunteer peer-sup port  system  for  the  frail  elderly.  Through  this  program,  low-income  Americans over the age of 60 serve as  senior companion for older adults in  their homes, nursing homes, or resi dential  institutions. Senior compan ions generally are required to work 20  hours per week. For  their  services  they receive a stipend of $2 per hour, a  hot meal,  transportation, an annual  physical examination, and  insurance  coverage. Such remunerations are, in  turn, of significant help to senior com panions as they themselves are often  living  on  only minimal  retirement  and/or Social Security benefits.  In addition to providing companion ship, senior companions take updated  knowledge and skills to their clients  who face a variety of limiting health  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  conditions and often isolation. As vol unteers, they work under the direction  of supervisors  in health and  social  services agencies and often attend edu cational  programs  addressing  such  topics as health, nutrition, household  management,  consumer  issues,  and  energy conservation.  Demographers predict that we are  moving toward a population with more  older people, including a large number  of healthy people over the age of 60.  As  the number of elderly  increases,  however, so does that segment of the  population with  functional  impair ments-those  in need of  long-term  care. Nearly  12 million  frail  older  people will need some  type of long term care in this decade, but as health  care costs continue to rise, the finan cial ability to access these services be comes difficult, if not impossible, for  most needy families. A recent Federal  study, as reported in the Wall Street  Journal of March 8, 1983, found that  if present trends continue, the $23 bil lion a year that it now costs to support  skilled nursing facilities would more  than triple by 1990.  The value of senior companions is  that they can provide or arrange for  the personal services needed to keep  the frail elderly in their homes. Ex pensive professionals are used only for  emergency or highly defined services  rather than for activities that a com panion can do as well or even better.  Although long-term care professionals  are a key element, they function pri marily as trainers and emergency care givers rather than as providers for all  services. This frees the professional to  handle more complex situations.  Senior companions constitute a vital  link between professional service pro viders and the elderly while also creat ing  a  network  linking  frail  older  people in a sustaining and nurturing  relationship.  In effect,  through  the  Senior Companion Program, the elder ly help the elderly, and as was recent ly reported by the Select Committee  on Aging Subcommittee on Human  Services, ...    who better knows the  needs of elders than those that are  senior adults?""  Senior Americans  constitute  the  single most neglected human resource  we have. This is an unfortunate and  an unnecessary waste to this society,  as they possess a  lifetime of experi ence and talents to offer this Nation. I  am proud to have been an original co sponsor of House Concurrent Resolu tion 333, commemorating the Senior  Companion Program, and I will con tinue to support programs and legisla tion that appreciate  the community  involvement of our older citizens.  I am certain that as this and similar  programs become better known, they  will be welcomed in every community.  But more importantly, I am hopeful  that  through  their  implementation,  the valuable talents of our senior citiSeptember 11, 1984  zens will be fully acknowledged and  utilized at long last.e  THE SALE OF CONRAIL  HON. JAMES J. FLORIO  OF NEW .JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  ~da~September11, 1984  e ",1984
1199,308,18,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, the De partment of Transportation is current ly considering various offers for the  sale of Conrail. Congress will have to  consider the Department's recommen dation, and  the various offers, very  carefully. Any sale should ensure con tinued rail service and maximize the  return to the United States on its in vestment.  The New Republic recently had an  article about the Conrail sale process.  For  the  information  of  interested  Members, the article from the July 30  issue follows:  GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY  <By Bob Kuttner>  Uncle Sam has a railroad for sale, and it  looks like whoever buys it is going to get one  honey of a deal. The railroad is Conrail, the  line that rose. from the wreckage of the old  Penn Central. The seller is the U.S. Depart ment of Transportation, which is currently  considering  fifteen private bids. And  the  various  prospective  purchasers-some  of  whom helped run Conrail's precursors into  the ground in the first place--don't have to  kick any wheels or slam any  freight-car  doors to know if the deal is sweet. They just  have to look at the numbers. The taxpayers  have been kind enough to spend $7.6 billion  to clean up Conrail's debts and upgrade the  line. Conrail  is  profitable: Last year  it  earned $313 million. It has nearly $700 mil lion  in cash in the bank. And it has tax  write-offs worth over $1 billion. An attrac tive package. The probable price? Perhaps  $500 million net, maybe a lot less. And why  does the Reagan Administration want to do  this? For the usual reason: it believes in free  enterprise.  If Congress concurs, the abrupt privatiza tion of Conrail will bring full circle a 15year process of private default, public subsi dy, and private enrichment. The bankruptcy  of the Penn Central Company in 1970 re flected equal failures of private manage ment and public policy. On one level, it was  an epic debacle of modem managerial cap italism. For decades, the proprietors of the  big eastern rail lines had failed to modern ize, had let maintenance slide, and had di verted capital  to  real estate speculation.  Poor  management  was  camouflaged  through consolidation and merger; expen sive contracts and featherbedding substitut ed for effective labor relations. The terms  ""disinvestment"" and ""paper entrepreneur ship"" had not yet been coined, but the big  railroads practiced them. In the endgame,  just before the bankruptcy, the Penn Cen tral hid its true, deteriorated condition from  the shareholding public only by borrowing  large sums of money in order to keep paying  dividends.  According to Congressional and SEC in vestigations, the last days of the Penn Cen tral were a hidden frenzy of insider dealing.  In the months before the Penn Central's  ",1984

The Colum bus-Cuneo-Cabrini  Medical  Center  bestows,  this,  its highest honor, on  those individuals who have worked un selfishly for the benefit of those less  fortunate, very much like Mother Ca brini herself. St. Cabrini was born to a  family of 12  children  in Lombardi,  Italy. Although she was never phys ically strong, she worked to carry the  burden of others.

When  she recognized the needs of Italian im migrants in the United States, Mother  Cabrini sailed to New York where she  established an orphanage. In 1892, she  founded Columbus Hospital. In 1909,  Mother Cabrini became a naturalized  citizen of the United States. She had  already given so much to this coun try's poor and homeless, but she treas ured the honor of becoming an Ameri can and worked harder to be worthy  of her new home. She traveled the  country, opening schools and orphan ages in Denver, Seattle, Los Angeles,  and Chicago. Her cheerfulness and  sense of humor were an inspiration to  all of those she helped. Mother Ca brini became ill and died in 1917.  The love and hope she brought to so  many immigrants prompted the Vati can to declare her life an heroic one,  and she was canonized on July 7, 1946.  The Mother Cabrini Award, which  this year honors Mr.  Irv Kupcinet,  Sun-Times  columnist,  and Mr. Ste phen Ruff, Sr., Chicago attorney, re minds us that service to others is the  highest calling. Our service to others  is rendered in the way we live our lives  each day, regardless of what work we  have chosen. Both men honored by  this award richly deserve this recogni tion. Highly successful in their chosen  fields, they could have been satisfied  with  this as enough.  Instead,  they  have chosen to remember the needs of  others and have given unselfishly of  their  time and  talents.  I  join with  their friends  in congratulating them  and commend  the Columbus-Cuneo Cabrini Medical Center for their own  dedicated service.e  HON. GLENN M.

1202,334,18,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, the  September 2 issue of the Washington  Post included an article by Jack An derson entitled ""The Twins of Ausch witz."" Mr. Anderson's somber piece of  journalism is the latest in a  long line  of books and articles which describe  the gruesome history of the Nazi con centration camp at Auschwitz. Unlike  many others, however, this article fo cuses on a very small minority of the  camp's inhabitants-those who were  chosen to remain alive solely because  they were  accompanied by  a  twin  brother or sister.  Forty years  after  attaining  their  freedom,  the survivors of Auschwitz  are still haunted by indelible memo ries of Dr. Josef Mengele, known to  many as ""The Angel of Death.""

1206,373,18,Mr. MURKOWSKI., I wonder if my  colleague  from Pennsylvania would  yield for a question.  ,1984
1207,373,18,Mr. HEINZ.," Not at this time. I am  just warming up.  He indicated that he did not believe  that his experience was  in any way  unique.  Now,  that is not to say that every  commercial banker has forgotten how  to make careful loans, but I do think  that it is  indicative  in particular of  how many banks, because of what  they perceive to be the changed dy namics of their industry, are looking  at some other business, some other  lines of business in an effort to grow in  some other direction.  Now,  normally  you  would  say,  ""What is the problem with that? It is  a free country. Why shouldn't banks  be  allowed  to grow wherever  they  want?""  And if we did not provide Federal de posit insurance, if we did not have a  low-interest  loan  facility  called  the  window at the Federal Reserve, if we  did not have failsafe insurance as evi denced by the $4.5 billion bailout of  Continental  Illinois  this  summer,  I  would say fine, let banks go into what ever lines of business they choose. And  there is no philosophical objection to  that.  We, however, chose many years ago,  I  think correctly,  to  recognize  that  banks perform a unique and essential  function  in  our monetary  system.  They are the custodians of the pay ments system  in  this country. It is  very  important that when somebody  writes a check that the person who  writes it and the person who receives  it understands, without  any  doubt  whatsoever, that all they have to do is  present that promise to pay to the fi nancial  intermediary,  a  bank or  a  S&L, and that will be immediately re deemed and/ or credited  to  their ac count.  Banks are the custodians of the de pository  base  and  the  payments  system and, because of their sensitive  nature, we have chosen to ask them,  by regulation-to compel them, I sup pose  you  could  say-to  observe  a  higher standard of underwriting than  we ask of other financial institutions  or of other businesses. Hence, we have  been cautious and careful for most of  the last 50 years as to which lines of  business,  in financial services, banks  could compete in.  ",1984
1208,386,18,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, I appreci ate  the  Senator  laying  down  his  amendment. We have been working  with him on a possibility to accept the  amendment. We will pursue that. In  any event, it is laid down, so we can  look at that in the morning.  ",1984
1209,386,18,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, I would  like  to  join with my colleague from  Nebraska  in sponsoring  this amend ment  to  assist  financially  troubled  banks with  large  agricultural  loan  portfolios.  Our farm economy is in trouble. For  1984,  farmland value has declined 5  percent, marking the fourth consecu tive year that the real value of farm land has fallen. At the same time after  adjusting for inflation net cash income  for 1984 could be down by more than  25 percent. To make matters worse,  farm production expenses are forecast  to rise 6  to 8 percent and cash ex penses are expected to rise by 8 to 10  percent.  It is no wonder then, that when the  Independent Bankers surveyed  their  membership among the mostly rural  banks, the lenders expect that about  17 percent of their present farm bor rowers will not be able to meet all of  their loan obligations in 1984.  It is now crucial that the Congress  act to include not only thrifts but also  those ailing rural commercial banks in  the net worth  assistance  program.  While the thrifts were and are still in  sad straits due to their mortgage lend ing activities, so are those commercial  banks which service primarily agricul tural communities. This amendment  would add a measure of capital ade quacy which permits  troubled com mercial banks to participate in the net  worth assistance program and would  expand the  test for assistance from  just  those  depository  institutions  which are in financial trouble due to a  commitment  to  residential  housing  lending to include those with a com mitment to agricultural loans.  It is clear,  the economic situation  confronting  American  agriculture  today is worse than the condition ex perienced  by  the  housing  finance  market when the net worth assistance  program was enacted.  The  adoption of  this amendment  will provide a means, through FDIC,  for banks and thrifts that service agri cultural communities to have time to  handle  these  farm  credit problems  without having to foreclose on farmers  or risk their own institutions' failure.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED  BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS  By Mr. LEVIN:  S. 2986. A bill to amend the Ethics in  Government Act of 1978 to provide for  programs designed to inform Federal  employees of applicable standards of  conduct,  to  improve  the administra tion of the ethics programs in the Fed eral Government, and for other pur poses;  to the Committee on Govern mental Affairs.  ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT ACT AMENDMENTS   ",1984
1212,399,18,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, today I  am  introducing legislation  to amend  the Ethics in Government Act of 1978  to  implement several of  the  recom mendations embodied  in  the House  Subcommittee on Human Resources'  report on  the ""Unauthorized Trans fers of Nonpublic Information During  the 1980 Presidential Election."" My  colleague  from Michigan  and  the  chairman of the subcommittee, Con gressman ALBosTA,  first  introduced  this legislation on May 23, 1984. A pro vision  in  the  original Albosta  bill  which would have imposed a criminal  penalty for the theft of confidential  campaign information in Federal elec tions was removed by the subcommit tee_ in its markup of the bill. The legis lation I am sponsoring is identical to  H.R. 5917, which was reported by the  House Post Office and Civil Service  Committee in June 1984.  This legislation is primarily designed  to establish mechanisms which will  generate a greater awareness on the  part of employees and officers of the  Federal Government of their obliga tions and duties under the ethics laws  and the standards of conduct. Toward  that goal, the bill requires the Office  of Government Ethics [OGEJ to estab lish a program of mandatory briefings  for all officers and employees of Fed eral agencies on the ethics laws and  the standards of conduct.  Mr. President, during the subcom mittee's  investigation  of  how  the  Reagan campaign obtained President  Carter's briefing books,  the staff of  the subcommittee asked interviewees  what information they have received  about the laws and standards govern ing  ethical conduct  in  the Federal  Government. According  to  the sub committee report,  the responses were generally disappoint ing. While most witnesses believed they un derstood their general obligations under the  law,  relatively  few  could  recall  specific  ethics education focusing on the Standards  of Conduct. Many thought they might have  been given written materials on the Stand ards of Conduct, along with numerous other  materials such as pay,  insurance,  tax and  other forms when they entered the Execu tive Branch. However,  few  indicated that  they actually read the material carefully.  sampl~  Mandatory  briefings  which  are  geared toward the varied duties and  responsibilities of employees and officers in the Federal agencies would in crease their awareness of the impor tance of avoiding even the appearance  of impropriety by strictly adhering to  both the letter and the spirit of the  laws and regulations governing ethical  conduct.  Second,  this bill  requires Federal  agencies, pursuant to regulations to be  promulgated by the Director of OGE  to  publish  summaries  of  agency  decisions  involving  financial  disclosure, standards of conduct, and  postemployement conflict of interest  regulations. The Director would also  be required to establish and maintain  a system of reporting these cases. The  Albosta subcommittee concluded in its  report at the end of its investigation  on how President Carter's papers were  obtained  by  the Reagan  campaign  that establishing such a system ""could  help warn against future violations by  providing anonymous case histories il lustrating how  the  standards  have  been applied."" Furthermore, if we are  to hold employees and officers of the  Federal Government  to  the highest  ethical standards, we should ensure  that they understand how the law has  actually been applied. In her testimo ny before the Human Resources Sub committee on the Albosta bill Louise  S. Greenfield, staff attorney fo~ Public  Citizen's Congress Watch stated that  Agency decisions on actual ethics cases  clarify  the responsibilities of agency em ployees who are subject to the ethics laws  and regulations. Exposure to such decisions  will deepen employees' understanding of  their duties and will make them more aware  of the sanctions for violating them. Employ ees need and deserve the additional guid ance which reports of these decisions will  offer.  Finally, the bill requires the Direc tor of the OGE, beginning in fiscal  year 1986 and every 4 years therefter  to submit  to  the Congress a  report  containing  findings  about  changes  which should be made in the ethics  law. The bill makes clear that the Di rector of the Office of Government  Ethics  is  responsible  for promoting  ethical conduct as well as preventing  conflicts of interest on the part of offi",1984
1213,451,18,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President, at a  time when education in our country is  the focus of so much attention, it is  my great pleasure  to commemorate  the 100th anniversary of the founding  of the Bryn Mawr School, one of the  Nation's first independent college pre paratory schools for girls.  Sharing the revolutionary idea that  girls were entitled to the same oppor tunity as boys for a challenging college  prep  education,  five  visionary  women-Martha Carey Thomas, Mary  Elizabeth Garrett, Mamie Gwinn, Eliz abeth Tabor King, and Julia Rebecca  Rodgers-established this outstanding  institution and opened  its doors on  September 21, 1885, in Baltimore, MD.  The curriculum, which  included sci ence and mathematics as well as the  classics, raised the eyebrows of Balti more parents as did a strenuous ath letic  program,  producing  the  first  women's lacrosse team in the country.  This group of young pioneers also  made possible  the existence of  the  Johns Hopkins Medical School,  for  which they raised the necessary funds  but turned them over only when the  trustees had agreed to admit women  on the same terms as men.  The leading efforts of Bryn Mawr's  founders were complemented by the  humanistic and classical spirit of the  school's  first  headmistress,  Edith  Hamilton, world renowned author of  ""The Greek Way,"" whose quarter cen tury at the school confirmed these tra ditions there. As one whose immigrant  parents taught me the importance of  these traditions, I share Miss Hamil ton's philosophy which is still reflect ed today at Bryn Mawr. Through its  programs, it fosters the development  of the intellect, appreciates the diver sity in individuals, and stresses the im portance of physical and moral well being. Miss Hamilton's vision of civili zation as ""a matter of delight in the  things of  the mind"" and her belief  that ""genuine  education  is possible  only when people realize that it has to  do with persons and not movements""  are truly being realized today at this  school.  Under  the  leadership of Headmis tress Barbara Landis Chase and her  outstanding faculty,  the Bryn Mawr  School can boast a  first-rate educa tional curriculum in addition to an ex ceptionally broad program of extra curricular activities. Bryn Mawr can  be very proud of  its alumnae, who  have distinguished themselves in the  field of arts, education, science, sports,  and politics.  This distinguished school has taken  a leadership role not just locally, but  nationally in the educational commu nity. As a  logical extension of Bryn  Mawr's encouragement of career-ori ented young women, it provides an ac credited nursery program, which has  been so successful that the school will  be developing and administering one  like it on the campus of Goucher Col lege. Bryn Mawr's foreign  language  program, which begins  in kindergar ten, was cited by President Carter's  Commission on Foreign Language and  International Study. A computer edu cation program, which also begins in  kindergarten, has served as a model  for many other schools. Two related  efforts-the ""math mentor"" program  and  ""summer  tech""-have  received  similar recognition for  their  innova tiveness in encouraging girls in math  and computer fields.  Bryn Mawr's reputation not only  stands on its high academic standards  and its leadership role in education for  women, but also on its economic, racial  and religious diversity, and its commit ment to community spirit and service.  The school reaches out to all income  levels in Baltimore through a growing  financial aid program and exposes stu dents to a variety of religious beliefs  and customs. Using Baltimore as  its  learning laboratory, the upper school  requires students to participate in the  city program, which introduces them  to urban problems and emphasizes the  importance of community service and  involvement.  It has always been my firm convic tion that there is no greater endeavor  than the training and education of our  Nation's young people. Offering the  opportunity for a complete education  and developing the potential for suc cess in this increasingly complex and  technical world, are among the most  important challenges facing our socie ty today. Through its principles and  programs, Bryn Mawr has been and  continues to be successful in preparing  its students to accept the full responsi bility of self-reliant adults who will be  called upon to lend a hand in keeping  our society on an even keel. Bryn  Mawr provides an excellent environ ment that helps girls develop into the  kinds of patient, hard-working, and  committed individuals so necessary to  keep the democratic process alive, but  most of all a willingness  to get  in volved  in the problems of their day  and to participate in their solution.  Most  recently,  the  Bryn Mawr  School was named one of 60 ""Exem plary Private Schools"" by the Council  for the Advancement of Private Edu cation and  the U.S. Department of  Education, on the basis of intellectual  growth and on efforts  to achieve a  multiracial, multicultural community  and to instill an ideal of service.  I am pleased to call the Senate's at tention to this celebration and ask my  colleagues to join in saluting the suc cess of the Bryn Mawr School, which,  for 100 years, has exemplified the best  of education and has succeeded in edu cating  thoughtful,  responsible,  and  productive individuals who continue to  form an enlightened and  intelligent  citizenry.  I ask that an editorial from the Bal timore Sun be reprinted in the REcoRD  at this point.  The editorial follows:  [From the Baltimore Sun, May 21, 19841  BRYN MAWR  Bryn Mawr  in North Baltimore has of fered the highest-quality college-preparato ry education to girls since 1885, when that  was a very adventurous concept, initiated in  part  to  feed highest-quality graduates  to  ",1984
1214,464,18,Mr. HATCH., Mr. President. I com mend the chairman of the Select Com mittee on Indian Affairs for his out standing and untiring work in develop ing a bill that contains many construc tive and innovative proposals for the  reauthorization of the Indian Health  Care Improvement Act. With well over  10.000  Indian citizens  in my home  State of Utah that are eligible for the  health care that is provided by the  Indian Health Service. I recognize the  importance of the act s  extension and  support the effort of the Select Com mittee on Indian Affairs to assure that  the outstanding unmet health care  needs of native Americans are ade quately addressed.  As Senator ANDREWS has stated. I  intend to work with the Assistant Sec retary for Health to assure that ad ministrative actions are taken that will  enhance the budgetary and advocacy  functions of the Indian Health Service  within the Department of Health and  Human Services. I have also requested  that as head of  the Public Health  Service.  the Assistant Secretary  for  Health  attempt  to  resolve  current  problems  of  contracting with  the  Indian Health Service. I believe that  these measures. properly  implement ed. will provide a sound basis upon  which to examine the need to elevate  the Indian Health Service in the next  Congress. Toward  that end.  I  have  agreed to join Senator ANDREWS in in troducing legislation establishing the  Indian Health Service as an agency of  the Public Health Service early in the  next Congress.  I  envision  that  the  Labor and Human Resources Commit tee  and  the Select Committee  on  Indian Affairs would work closely to gether. both in joint hearings and in  the evaluation of the record from such  hearings.  to determine whether  the  problems  confronting  the  Indian  Health Service can best be resolved by  the elevation of  the  Indian Health  Service within the Public Health Serv ice.  that  <No.  4105) was  I am in full agreement with my col league. Mr. ANDREws. that this impor tant Indian health care reauthoriza tion  legislation  warrants  prompt  Senate passage prior to the existing  act s  expiration.  and  it  is  for  that  reason that I have agreed to remove  my hold on S. 2166.  ,1984
1215,464,18,Mr. ANDREWS., I thank the Senator  from Utah for his kind words and for  the great concern he has manifested  for  the health care needs of native  Americans. We share a common per spective in terms of the need to assure  that  the  health  status  of  Indian  people is raised to the highest possible  level. It is time that the Senate act to  extend authority for health care for  the native people of this country. so  that the goal of  the Indian Health  Care Improvement Act can be realized  and so that our first Americans may  one day enjoy  the same benefits of  good health that so many of us take  for granted.  ,1984

1223,464,18,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. President. as  chairman of the Select Committee on  Indian Affairs. I rise today to request  that the Senate vote to pass S. 2166, a  bill to reauthorize the Indian Health  Care  Improvement  Act  of  1976  through fiscal year 1988.  In 1976. alarming statistics concern ing  the very poor health status of  American  Indian and Alaska Native  people prompted Congress  to enact  the Indian Health Care Improvement  Act. Findings of Congress  indicated  that as compared to all Americans in  1971. Indians suffered a  tuberculosis  death rate over 4 Vz  times greater. an  influenza and pneumonia death rate  over 1% times greater, and an infant  death rate that was approximately 20  percent higher than the rest of the  U.S. population.  Today, data submitted to the Indian  Affairs  Committee  by  the  Indian  to  lay  that  Health Service indicates that in 1984.  the  death  rate  from  tuberculosis  among  Indians  is  six  times greater  than  the  general  population.  the  infant mortality  rate  is  11  percent  higher among Indians and Alaska Na tives.  and  the  incidence of chronic  liver disease. diabetes. pneumonia. in fluenza, and hypertension among Indi ans also greatly exceeds national aver ages for all other races in the United  States. Recent epidemics of bubonic  plague among Indians in the South west and of hepatitis-B among Alaska  Natives are further evidence that dis eases  long ago eradicated from  inci dence  in  the non-Indian population  continue to afflict Native Americans.  Although dramatic gains in improv ing the health of Indians and Alaska  Natives have been realized since 1976.  it is not surprising  that the health  status of native people continues  to  lag substantially behind that of the  general American population when per  capita expenditures  for health care  are examined. In 1977. the per capita  health care expenditure for the U.S.  population at large was $630. By 1984.  that per capita health care expendi ture has risen to approximately $1.400.  In contrast. the per capita expenditure  for Indian health care has been re duced from $570 per patient in 1977 to  $390 in 1984.  The Indian Health Care  Improve ment Act was  intended  to close  the  gap  in health status between Native  Americans and other Americans. by  raising the health status of Indian and  Alaska Native people  to  the highest  possible  level. The most  recent evi dence of progress in achieving health  status parity makes it painfully clear  that the goal of the act remains unful filled in 1984.  S. 2166 proposes to extend the major  programs authorized by  the  Indian  Health  Care  Improvement  Act  through fiscal year 1988. recognizing  and reaffirming the Federal responsi bility for the provision of health care  services  to Native Americans  in ex change for lands ceded to the United  States by Indian  tribes pursuant  to  treaties. Executive orders. and various  acts of Congress. The Federal Govern ment's responsibility for Indian health  care  is  administered by  the  Indian  Health Service. a bureau of the Public  Health Service within the Department  of Health and Human Services. To  achieve  the objectives of  improving  the management and accountability of  the  Indian Health Service  and  to  foster increased tribal involvement in  Indian health issues. S. 2166 proposes  organizational changes for the Indian  Health Service which include the ele vation of the Indian Health Service to  the  level of an agency within  the  Public Health Service. The proposed  organizational changes are designed to  encourage the formulation of a nation",1984

",1984
1225,477,18,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker,  today we  are witnessing  a  special  event: Women coming together to dis cuss what predominantly has been a  man's subject-arms control and na tional security.  National  polls  show  that women  overwhelmingly  support  efforts  at  arms control;  in fact  this difference  has been the heart of the gender gap.  Women are trying to help humanity  prepare for our final exam on whether  we can qualify to continue aboard the  planet. Women  agreed with Henry  Kissinger when he  said, ""With  the  overwhelming arsenal of the nuclear  age, the pursuit of marginal advantage  is both pointless and potentially suici dal.""  The women attending  this confer ence have made outstanding contribu tions to the fields of business, politics,  the arts, religion, education, athletics,  civil rights, and social sciences. They  are here to take an active role in the  arms control debate. Conference par ticipants are not just here  to talk they are here  to act, because  they  know that's the only way we'll pass  the exam for the planet's future, since  there is no emergency exit from the  planet.  The focus of the conference is a call  to action-to define and propose steps  that governments can take to prevent  nuclear war. The recommendations of  the conference will be conveyed  to  women  in  communities  throughout  the country, so they will  join in the  action and insist people they vote for  will act also.  MONDALE'S DEFICIT PLAN WILL  GIVE AVERAGE AMERICAN A  WALLOPING DEFICIT IN POCK ETBOOK  (Mr. CAMPBELL  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1984
1226,477,18,Mr. CAMPBELL.," Mr. Speaker, the  economic  recovery  that  the current  administration has worked so hard to  achieve will be on the brink of collapse  if Walter Mondale is allowed to imple ment his so-called deficit plan, which  raises taxes on the middle class. The  average American citizen will have a  walloping deficit in their pocketbook that Mr. Speaker, is not fair.  Millions of Americans recently put  back to work could be back in the un employment line, and end up increas ing, not lowering, the Federal budget  deficit-that, Mr. Speaker, is not fair.  Mondale's promise to raise taxes $85  billion per year amounts  to almost  $1,000 per household-most of which  will fall on the middle-income worker  whose  family  income  is  $25,000.  Hidden promises and cooked numbers  that appear  to have  come  straight  from Mondale's family  recipe book  mean a tax increase that could actual ly be twice as much. That Mr. Speak er, is not fair.  What the whole scheme boils down  to is an $85 billion tax increase added  to his campaign special interest group  spending  promises,  subtracted  from  some  questionable  savings,  which  come out to equal a  tax increase of  more  that  $200  billion-that Mr.  Speaker is not fair and the American  people will not stand for it.

1231,490,18,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in strong support of the confer ence report for H.R. 5798, the Treas ury, Postal Service, and general Gov ernment appropriations bill for fiscal  year 1985.  At the outset, I would like to con gratulate my good friend from south em California,  the chairman of the  subcommittee, En RoYBAL,  and  the  ranking minority member of the sub committee, CLARENcE MILLER, on craft ing another fine bill. Commendations  are also, of course, in order for Chair man JAMIE WHITTEN and the ranking  minority member of the full commit tee, SIL CoNTE.  Of particular interest to me is lan guage in title IV of the report relating  to the construction of a new, 187,000  occupiable square foot office building  in Long Beach, CA. Specifically, $20  million is provided to begin construc tion next year on this badly needed fa cility.  So that my colleagues may have a  better idea why this facility is needed,  some background on the project might  be useful.  The construction of a new Federal  building in Long Beach is one which I  have envisioned since local civic lead ers  initiated a downtown  redevelop ment plan in 1975.  It wasn't until about 3 years ago,  however,  that  I  formally charted a  plan of action to get this project off  the ground. At that time, the Commit tee on Public Works and Transporta tion was considering numerous Feder al office space lease extensions, or pro spectuses, at various cities across the  country. One of these cities happened  to be Long Beach.  Upon careful review of the material  which was submitted to the committee  for approval, I was shocked to find out  that the Federal Government wanted  to spend nearly $70 million over the  next 30 years  to simply rent office  space in Long Beach. At my request,  the  committee  postponed  further  action on this matter pending a more  thorough  examination of  the past,  present, and projected space needs of  the  Federal Government  in Long  Beach.  In July 1982, the Subcommittee on  Public Buildings and Grounds held a  field hearing in Long Beach to study  the space needs of the Federal Gov ernment in this area and to hear from  local community leaders on whether  or not it would be more cost efficient  to build a new Federal facility rather  than continue leasing space.  Not only did Long Beach leaders tes tify in support of moving forward with  construction but, also, officials from  the General Services Administration  [GSAl, who are, of course, in charge  of all real estate transactions for the  Federal Government.  Later that same month, the House,  at my urging, authorized the construc tion  of  a  new  105,000  occupiable  square  foot,  $21.7 million,  Federal  building in Long Beach. As compared  to  rent extensions previously under  consideration,  we  could  save  the  Treasury roughly $50 million over the  next 30 years by constructing a new  facility rather than continuing leasing  space. And, there is little doubt that  this building would be in use well past  this 30-year period.  The saga of the Long Beach Federal  building does not end here, however.  GSA came back to me in 1983 and said  that they had reexamined the project ed growth in the Long Beach area and,  in order to accommodate this growth,  we needed to nearly double the size of  the Long Beach building. Today, this  facility  is  authorized  to  contain  187,000 occupiable square feet and is  slated to cost $41.1 million. I was told  recently  that because more Federal  agencies want to be relocated to this  larger facility, the net savings to the  Federal Government over the next 30  years will be roughly $73 million-as  compared to the earlier figure of $50  million when the Long Beach building  was first authorized.  To date,  the President has signed  into  law,  legislation which appropri ated $6.2 million for site acquisition  and design of the Long Beach build ing. The site selected and approved is  within the new World Trade Center  complex. With regard to design, GSA  has already announced that this facili ty will be the first Federal building in  the Nation to incorporate, at one loca tion, many high-tech features. Some  of these features include passive solar  systems, high-strength concrete, state of-the-art communications, and para bolic lighting. Also,  the Long Beach  building, will be,  in a sense, a  living  structure whose walls will be able to  expand and contract to better accom modate future tenants and their spe cial needs in the years ahead.  In a nutshell, a new Federal office  building in Long Beach will not only  save the Treasury quite a bit of reve nue but, also, better serve those who  must conduct business with the Feder al Government. Currently, Federal of fices are scattered at various locations  across Long Beach and the surround ing area. With the House's approval  today, we can consolidate these func tions which will save us literally mil lions of hard-earned taxpayer dollars  and better serve the residents of Long  Beach and the immediate vicinity.  I urge all of my colleagues to sup port this legislation.   ",1984

1237,529,18,Mr. LEHMAN of California.," I thank  the gentleman.  Furthermore, it is my view, that has  been substantiated by a congressional  research  service  legal  opinion  that  with or without enactment of H.R.  1437, new congressional authorization  would be required to increase the size  of O'Shaugnessy Dam or related facili ties.  Mr. Speaker, I am including the fol lowing information for the benefit of  my colleagues:  CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE,  THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS,  .  Washington, DC, Dec. 19, 1983.  To: Honorable Richard Lehman.  From: American Law Division.  Subject: The Hetch Hetchy Water Project.  By  the ""Raker Act"" of 1913,1 Congress  granted the City and County of San Fran cisco, subject to express conditions, certain  lands and rights-of-way in Yosemite Nation al Park and the Stanislaus National Forest.  The legislation was intended to assist the  City  in  constructing  and maintaining  a  means of supplying water for the domestic  purposes of the City of San Francisco and  other public bodies and included an electric  power facility. You have informed us that a  study has recommended that the height of  the O'Shaughnessy Dam that was built as  part of the Hetch Hetchy Project and is lo cated  in Yosemite National Park, be  in creased in order to expand the reservoir ca pacity and supply additional water to San  Francisco. You have asked us if the dam can  be raised under the existing authority, or  whether new authority is needed.  Section 9(k) of the 1913 Act states: ""That  when the said grantee begins the develop ment of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir site, it  shall undertake and vigorously prosecute to  completion a dam at least two hundred feet  high, with a foundation capable to support ing said dam when built to its greatest eco nomic and safe height.""  This language might be interpreted as an  indication that Congress contemplated that  the dam might be  raised  in  the  future.  Other parts of the act, however, emphasize  that  the  project was  to  be  completed  promptly, and do not speak in terms of ex pansion. See, e.g., section 2, which speaks of  the filing within three years of maps show ing the extent of the facilities  to be con structed, and section 5 which states that the  ""construction of the aforesaid works shall  be prosecuted diligently, and no cessation of  such  construction  shall  continue  for  a  period of three consecutive years,"" and au thorizes a  forfeiture of  the rights of the  grantee for failure to diligently construct. It  appears from these portions of the statute  that Congress intended the project to be a  coherent whole that was  within a few years after enactment.  The principal committee report confirms  that the project was to be promptly con structed and that its features were not seen  as openended or expandable. The House  Report,2  a copy of which is attached, ex plains the project at length. <The Senate  Report 3  is only one page long and cross ref erences  the House Report>. Reference  is  made to a report of the Corps of Engineers  that indicate that the maximum height of  the dam could be 325 feet. 4 The Committee  analysis of the bill explains section 9(k) on  to be completed  Footnotes at end of letter.  the dam height: Paragraph (k), section 9 re quires San Francisco to build a dam at l~ast  200 feet high.  (This means  that  the city will expend  from $500,000 to $1,000,000 in excess of ini tial expenditures necessary for its immedi ate need. The intent is to build the dam  high enough to provide adequate storage to  mee~ the conditions of the grant, and is pri marily a benefit for the irrigationists.) 11  Given the fact that the dam was to be  bull~ at nonfederal expense, the language of  sect1on 9(k) therefore appears merely to es tablish a minimum height to insure that the  project was worthwhile, but also gives the  nonfederal builders flexibility to decide how  much storage was desired and how much  money to spend. The balance of the lan guage may merely have been meant  to  impose good workmanship requirements of  the kind contained elsewhere in the bill. s  Section 1 of the Act  indicates that the  purpose of the grants is the development of  a water supply and delivery system for ""con veying water for domestic purposes and uses  to the city and county of San Francisco and  such other municipalities and water dis tricts as, with the consent of the city and  county of San Francisco, or in accordance  with the laws of the State of California in  force at the time application is made, may  hereafter participate in the beneficial use of  the rights and privileges granted by  this  Act."" This language as to other cities is re peated in the section 8 definition of ""grant ee"". Therefore, it could be argued that the  dam could be raised in order to provide addi tional cities with water as they later partici pate in the benefits of the Act.  Again, however,  the statute as a whole  seems to contemplate the project as a com pleted whole and that these possible future  needs of other towns in the San Francisco  area would be reflected in the dam height  and storage capacity San Francisco chose.  The scope and purposes of a project are of  central importance in analyzing the extent  to which a federal constructing agency such  as the Army Corps of Engineers may exer cise discretion to modify a project:  The 1951 Chief of Engineers' report made  a comprehensive review of the scope of ex ecutive authority to modify projects previ ously approved by Congress, setting forth  general principles as follows:  The Corps of Engineers  recognize  that  this latitude for changes and modifications  of authorized projects represents an impor tant delegation of authority, and the Corps  has attempted  to exercise  that authority  carefully. In general, the Corps of Engineers  considers that there are two types of modifi cations:  a. Modifications and changes of a project  which are necessary for engineering or con struction reasons to produce the degree and  extent of flood protection or the extent of  navigation  improvement intended by Con gress are within the latitude delegated to  the Corps of Engineers. Examples of such  changes are shift of a dam  to a nearby  better location; provision of a greater stor age capacity  required by more complete  flood records; shifts in alinement of chan nels indicated by more detailed surveys; or  changes from a concrete to an earth struc ture because of lack of proper concrete ag gregate. These may be considered generally  as engineering modifications.  b. Moderate extensions of project scope  such as those required to provide flood pro tection to adjacent urban areas which have  developed since the project was authorized  or to provide better channel alinement o;  larger navigation locks to meet the needs of  developing commerce. It would obviously be  uneconomical and contrary to the intent of  Congr~ss to construct obsolete projects, or  to om1t flood protection for a part of a city  when it was the intent of Congress to au thorize flood protection for that city. These  may be  considered  generally  as  project  modifications necessary  to meet changed  physical and economic conditions.            On the other hand, the Corps of Engi neers has considered that it does not have  latitude to make modifications which mate rially extend the scope and change the func tions of the project authorized by Congress.  It considers that it is necessary to bring a  proposed modification  of  an  authorized  project to the attention of Congress if fur ther study after authorization shows that:  a. The scope or functions of the project  will be materially changed thereby.  b. The plan of improvement will be mate ~ially changed from that originally author tzed by Congress.  c. There are special circumstances which  were not known to the Corps of Engineers  or recognized by Congress when the project  was authorized.  N~ hard-and-fast rule can be cited as gov errung when a project modification should  be presented to Congress for further consid eration.  Increased cost over  the estimate  presented to Congress as a basis for authori z~tion is not necessarily a governing crite non, as the major factors giving rise to in creased costs are separate and apart from  the intent of Congress in authorizing an im provement, and as the Appropriations Com mittee  of Congress  are  advised  of  cost  changes year by year. 7  Increasing the height of this dam might  well be beyond the authorization in this in stance even for  federal construction as a  modification that would materially change  the scope of the project in response to cir cumstances that Congress clearly was aware  of in the first authorization. Congress gave  San Francisco the opportunity to determine  in the project planning how much storage  capacity to build. Also,  in the years since  the completion of the project, there has de veloped increased recognition of the conser vation values of National Parks and of envi ronmental concerns in general. This devel opment  lends credence  to  the argument  that enlarging the dam and reservoir consti tutes  a  significant modification  of  the  project for which new authority is needed.  Furthermore, the dam actually was con structed by nonfederal entities. To increase  the dam and hence  its storage capacity  would, of course, raise the level of the water  in  the  reservoir,  thereby submerging  the  surrounding  lands. The documentation of  the 1913 Act indicates that much of this  land_ is federal and is within a national park.  Sect10n 9<t> of the Act required the grantee  to convey to the United States title to any  and all tracts of land then owned by the  grantee within Yosemite and the part of the  national forest adjacent thereto. Therefore  the lands that would be submerged appear  to be federal, and they could not be sub merged and  their value  impaired or de stroyed without  the consent of Congress.  Congress is granted the authority to dispose  of federal property under Art. IV, Section 3  of  the Constitution  and  this  authority  cannot be interfered with or embarassed in  its exercise by state legislation.8 If the 1913  Act cannot fairly be said to grant Congres",1984

1241,555,18,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under  a previous order of the House, the gen tleman from Mississippi [Mr. LoTTl is  recognized for 5 minutes.  e ",1984
1242,555,18,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  have  introduced  a  resolution  that  would amend House rules by striking  the present House broadcasting rule,  House rule I, clause 9, and add a new  rule LI providing for the complete and  unedited broadcast coverage of House  proceedings.  I have  introduced  this new House  broadcast rule because I think it is im portant to remove the taint of parti san manipulation, control or censor ship of our televised proceedings. As  my  colleagues  are well  aware,  the  Speaker currently exercises exclusive  authority and control over our broad cast system, and that authority came  under heavy fire last May when the  Speaker ordered the cameras to show  the  entire Chamber during  special  order speeches at the end of the day.  Prior to that time, the cameras had  only shown closeup shots of the per sons speaking. The Speaker admitted  that he had made this change in re sponse  to Republican  special order  speeches which were critical of certain  Democrats.  Mr. Speaker, we have made it quite  clear on our side that we would have  no objection to showing periodic views  of the entire Chamber, so long as it is  done on a uniform basis throughout  each  day's  proceedings,  including  during the debates on legislation. But  the Speaker has not adopted such a  uniform policy. He has thereby under scored his initial intent and principal  motivation which is to embarrass Re publican  speakers who  have  been  using the special order period at the  end of each day  to emphasize  their  agendas. This special order period is  especially important to the minority  party in the House since it otherwise  has no opportunity to indicate or dis cuss  the  issues which  it  thinks  the  Congress should be dealing with. The  majority  party  sets  the  legislative  agenda  for  the House, which  is  its  right.  THE NEW BROADCAST RULE  Mr. Speaker, the new rule which I  am proposing would still retain the ul timate control of the House broadcast  system under  the Speaker, which  is  his prerogative as the presiding officer  of  the House with control over  the  Chamber. However,  the  rule would  modify that authority in two  impor tant respects. First, the Speaker would  be advised by a completely bipartisan  Broadcast Advisory Board consisting  of the majority and minority leaders  and  four other Members,  two  from  each party. Such a Board was original ly recommended by the ad hoc Sub committee  on Broadcasting  of  the  Rules Committee in the 94th Congress  and incorporated in House Resolution  875 reported from that subcommittee.  Ironically,  that proposal was  signed  off on by then majority  leader, TIP  O'NEILL, who was acting as Speaker  Albert's agent in negotiations with the  subcommittee. Unfortunately, the sub committee's resolution was recommit ted by the full Rules Committee for  further refinement. The subcommittee  subsequently reported House Resolu tion 1502 which retained the biparti san Broadcast Advisory Board, but no  further action was taken on the reso lution in that Congress.  In the 95th Congress, another Rules  Subcommittee worked on the House  broadcasting issue, and ultimately rec ommended a House owned and operat ed system under the Speaker, with its  actual operation to be delegated to a  new or existing House committee. The  proposal was endorsed by  the Rules  Committee and eventually was accept ed  by  the Speaker. However,  the  Speaker appointed a Speaker's Adviso ry Committee on Broadcasting heavily  weighted to the Democrats by a 3-to-1  ratio. But even that Advisory Commit tee was abandoned at the beginning of  the 97th Congress, and now only one  of its members remains as an adviser  to the Speaker.  I think the time has come to resur rect the original proposal of a com pletely bipartisan broadcast advisory  board to remove any hint of partisan  control of the cameras.  The second important feature of my  new rule is also a variation on a pro posal of the bipartisan Rules Subcom mittee in the 94th Congress. It had  recommended  that  the  broadcast  system be operated by a network pool,  rather than by the House. Since we al ready have a House-owned system in  place, I am not recommending that we  revert  to  that proposal, but  instead  have proposed that the hiring of the  broadcast personnel, their supervision,  and the formulation of coverage poli cies be vested in the Executive Com mittee of  the Radio and Television  Correspondents' Galleries-profession al broadcasters. While  the Speaker  would still retain ultimate control over  the system, he would be required to  consult with his bipartisan advisory  board before any major policy changes  are made. Moreover, it would be ex pected that there would be no inter ference with the delegation made to  the professional broadcasters for the  daily operation of the system so long  it is being conducted in conformance  with the traditional standards of dig nity, decorum, and propriety of con duct associated with proceedings  in  the House Chamber under our prece dents.  Finally, my new rule would  reem phasize that the broadcast coverage be  complete,  unedited,  and  continuous  while the House is in session-gavel-to gavel coverage which would include a  view of the Chamber while Members  are voting as well as the special order  speeches at the end of the day. While  our present rule also requires this, the  Speaker has  instituted  a  policy of  blacking-out the voting in the Cham ber, something which in my opinion,  based on the history of the rule, is in  violation of the present rule.  My rule would also retain the cur rent prohibition on using the televised  coverage  in  commercial  advertise ments or for partisan political cam paign purposes.  Mr. Speaker,  I  think the proposal  which I am offering today strikes a  balance between the two alternatives  which were heatedly debated  in the  94th and 95th Congresses, a House  broadcast system versus one operated  by the networks. But, by placing the  daily operation of the system in the  hands of personnel who would be di rectly responsible to the elected com mittee of professional broadcasters in  the Congress, subject to the check of  the Speaker and the new bipartisan  advisory board, I think we can take a  giant step toward restoring confidence,  quality, and credibility in our broad cast system.  At  this point  the RECORD, Mr.  Speaker, I include a section-by-section  summary of my resolution. The sum mary follows:  in  SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY OF LoTT  HOUSE BROADCASTING RESOLUTION  TITLE  SEc. 1. The resolution may be cited as the  ""House Broadcasting Amendments of 1984.""

Mr. Boettcher holds a B.S. degree in  finance, as well as a master of business  administration. He has worked with  United Air Lines for 15 years, and was  named ""San Francisco Junior Achieve ment Adviser of the Year,"" as well as  ""Business Manager of  the Year""  in  the Food Services Division.  Mr. Boettcher  is widely  respected  and admired for his record of service  to the local community. His interest in  education has led him to be elected to  the San Mateo City School District  Board of Trustees, and he is currently  acting as  the vice president of that  board. He has also served the district  as a member of the Financial Advisory  Committee.  Throughout his life, Jerry Boettcher  has been actively involved with young  people, never hesitating to share his  skills with them. He is affiliated with  the Peninsula YMCA and has served  as chairman of the board. He is also a  member of the board of the San Fran cisco Metropolitan YMCA.

ROBERT W. DAVIS  OF :MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 12, 1984  e ",1984
1270,581,18,Mr. DAVIS.," Mr. Speaker, I am in troducing a bill today that will clarify  the logbook requirements for vessels  on the Great Lakes that sail to Cana dian ports.  Under prior law-former 46 U.S.C.  544-these  vessels  on  a  voyage  to  Canada were not required to maintain  logbooks. However, in the codification  of the shipping laws in title 46 of the  United States Code this provision was  inadvertently  omitted. Thus,  under  section 11301(a) vessels of the United  States sailing between a port in the  United States and a port in a foreign  country are required to have an offi cial logbook with specific types of en tries that must be made. The reason  for a logbook is to ensure that seamen  on board vessels  that go  to foreign  ports  are  afforded  the  appropriate  protection and relief under U.S.  law.  However,  in the prior law the policy  was  that these protections were not  necessary for voyages to Canada be cause of the close proximity of these  ports. Other similar provisions regard ing the seamen's welfare laws also con tain  an  exemption  for  voyages  to  Canada and other nearby ports for  this reason.  The bill  I  am  introducing  today  would simply restore this provision so  that vessels sailing to Canada would  not merely have to begin to set up the  paperwork to comply with logbook re quirements because of an oversight in  the codification of  title 46, United  States Code. Thus, from a historical  and legal perspective, this provision in  no way diminishes the protection af forded  our American  seamen  and  serves to eliminate this ambiguity in  our shipping laws.e  THE QUALITY WORK FORCE AT  GENERAL  MOTORS'  DELCO  ELECTRONICS  MILWAUKEE  PLANT  HON. GERALD D. KLECZKA  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 12, 1984  e Mr. K.LECZKA. Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to bring to my colleagues  ",1984
1271,594,18,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker. while I  generally support the goals of H.R.  4277. the Natural Gas Market Polley  Act of 1984,  I am greatly disturbed  with the anticonsumer section 601 of  the bill which would repeal title II of  the Powerplant and  Industrial Fuel  Use Act of 1978.  This title of the Fuel Use Act pro hibits the construction of new natural  gas electric utility boilers.  It is my belief that we must give pri ority to residential and industrial uses  of natural gas as opposed to allowing  this valuable energy resource  to be  used by new electric utilities  as  a  boiler fuel for the purpose of generat ing electricity. This belief is reinforced  by  the  fact  that every estimate of  future domestic natural gas produc tion does not indicate there will be a  dramatic increase in our natural gas  resource base.  In light of the great uncertainties  surrounding future natural gas avail ability, prudence dictates that title II  of  the Fuel Use Act be  retained.  Indeed,  the proposed elimination of  title II raises the specter of the Nation  revisiting the natural gas shortages ex perienced during the winter of 1976-77  when  factories  and  schools  closed  Ironically, this was the very situation  which led to enactment of the NGPA  and the Fuel Use Act in the first place.  As such, if section 601 of H.R. 4277 is  passed by  the Congress,  residential  and  industrial users of natural gas  may find that at some point in the  future  their gas supplies have been  curtailed because of new electric utility demand for those very same sup plies.  Another reason why I oppose  the  repeal of title II of the Fuels Use Act  is that due to Federal wellhead price  controls on natural gas-continued for  the most part by H.R. 4277-natural  gas if allowed to be used in new elec tric  utility  boilers would  have  an  unfair advantage over other fuels such  as coal.  In such an environment, the Federal  Government would be promoting utili ty use of natural gas through these  price controls.

1272,607,18,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in  support of the conference report on S.  2463, which establishes the ocean and  coastal resources management and de. velopment  fund  from which  block  grants will be made to coastal States  and territories, and which authorizes  appropriations  for  several National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  programs  and deep seabed mining.  The conference report before us is  the result of OCS revenue sharing leg islation, developed and introduced by  our chairman during the 1st session of  the 97th Congress. I will neither at tempt to detail the many hearings and  negotiating sessions conducted by our  committee, nor discuss the many revi sions this legislation has gone through  over  the 3-year period  in order  to  reach the consensus before us today.  However, I do want to point out some  of the more important aspects of this  bill to my colleagues.  First, this bill would establish a fund  into which deposits equal to 4 percent  of average OCS oil and gas receipts  would be made, and from which States  would receive block grants for the pur their ocean and  coastal  resources. As we  all know,  Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas  development has not always been a  popular issue in coastal States because  of their limited ability to plan for and  accommodate offshore  leasing,  even  though such leasing will result in this  Nation's energy independence.  Mr. Speaker, may I say for those of  us who hear about the dependency on  foreign countries for our oil supply,  this bill will solve that dependence and  make us indendent of the foreign oil  which we import today.  pose of managing  Although  the OCS  now  provides  about 9 percent of  the Nation's oil  supply, it is estimated that up to 60  percent of this Nation's remaining un produced oil  is  located on the OCS.  Yet only 2 percent of  the Federal  lands offshore are under lease and we  are depending on foreign sources for  over 30 percent of our crude oil-a not too-stable supply, I might add, if my  colleagues will look at what has hap pened  in  the  straits  overseas. Al though we have barely  tapped our  OCS oil and gas resources, we cannot  expect  to  carry  out  any  positive  energy plan offshore without the co operation of coastal States and com munities. They are expected to bear  the burden of the social, environmen tal, and economic impacts which may  result  from  such offshore develop ment. Without the financial resources  to carry out coastal planning and to  address impacts associated with OCS  activities, they often feel they are left  with one alternative-to oppose all off shore development so these problems  will never arise.  This bill will once again give coastal  States the incentive to support OCS  development and promote our energy  independence by providing them with  block grants for the express purpose  of  enhancing  and managing  their  coastal resources and alleviating any  adverse  impacts  that  result  from  energy-related activities.  An even more important aspect of  this bill is that each State receiving a  block grant must provide one-third of  such allocation  to  its  local govern ments to carry out their responsibil ities under the act. It is usually the  local  communities which  bear  the  greatest burden from offshore and on shore energy activities, not the States,  and I believe it is essential that local  communities  have  the  funds  they  need.  Mr. Speaker, I think the enactment  of this legislation will result  in the  Federal-state partnerships, the Good  Neighbor policy promoted by this ad ministration, necessary  to carry out  our energy independence goals while  protecting State and  local  interests,  and may I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that  the chairman of the committee, the  gentleman from North Carolina, made  a proper statement. There are those  who are opposed to this legislation in  the administration. The administra tion and I  respectfully disagree. We  have  been  impeded,  but not  only  during this administration, by actions  of coastal States because  they have  nothing to gain by Federal offshore  development when there is no sharing  of the revenues. If we want to be inde pendent, if we want the oil for the  American people to develop our econo my, if we want to be able to direct our  own destiny,  then this bill must be  passed. It already passed this House  once by a vote of 301 to 93, I believe,  and the last time ft passed, it passed  by a voice vote.  I urge my colleagues to support this  conference  report  that was  signed  unanimously by the Senators and by  the House Members of the conference.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  0 1220  Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen  tleman  from Ne:w Hampshire  [Mr.  D'.A!IOURS].  I  is making  [Mr. BREAUX],  Mr. D'AMOURS. Mr.  Speaker,  thank  the committee chairman  for  yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I  rise today in strong  support of the conference repo:rt on S.  2463, legislation which would forge a  new  Federal-State  partnership  in  ocean and coastal resource manage ment and offshore oil and gas develop ment.  I would  like  to say  Just  for  the  record, reflecting no inordinate pride  of  subcommittee  chairmanship  and  with all due deference to the gentle man  from Louisiana  chairman of  the Subcommittee on  Fisheries and Wildlife, an admittedly  ubiquitous member of the committee,  that this bill did emerge from the Sub committee  on  Oceanography,  for  which my good friend, the gentleman  from Alaska [Mr. YoUNG],  proper penance for having misspoke at  this time.  Mr. Speaker, Chairman JONES has  already detailed the provisions of the  conference report for the House. Let  me  just say  that  this  legislation  is  similar in  its specific provisions and  identical in its thrust to H.R. 5, which  was overwhelmingly approved by the  House on September 14, 1983, by a  vote of 301-98. One reason it passed  the House so convincingly was  that  Members agreed that the bill was fis cally responsible.  Opponents have argued  that OCS  revenue sharing will bust the budget.  This is most assuredly not the case. In  fact, it is the absence of legislation of  this  nature which  is  significantly  adding to our already oversized Feder al budget deficit.  A study prepared by the Department  of the Interior 2 years ago for  the  Cabinet Council on Natural Resources'  working group on revenue sharing es timated that State and local opposi tion to OCS leasing costs the Federal  Treasury $1 billion a year. That's $1  billion a year, and the report goes on  to say that this is a conservative esti mate. The final and concluding para graph of this Reagan administration  study finds that:  The only apparent solution to reducing  the costs of opposition to the OCS Program  is to provide States and localities with an in centive to support leasing which Is perceived  by the States and localities as sufficient to  counterbalance their perception of the po",1984

1278,620,18,Mr. HAWKINS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Today the Members have an oppor tunity to cast an affirmative vote for a  piece of legislation that offers action  and assistance-not just recommenda tions  and  rhetoric-to  improve  the  quality of education in this country.  This bill, H.R. 5609, the American De fense Education Act, provides Federal  funds to local school districts to up grade their instructional programs in a  number of areas that are critical to  our Nation's security and economic  competitiveness.  This legislative initiative has biparti san support and 234 cosponsors for  good reason: It is a sound response to  the Nation's demand for quality edu cation. All of the major reports calling  for educational reform have centered  on the need for improvements at the  elementary and secondary school dis trict and school building level. Most  have  advocated  a  comprehensive  reform of education, affecting all stu dents  and  several  curricular  areas.  Many have reaffirmed a Federal role  in education.  We are misguided if we believe that  this country can mount a wide-scale  effort to enhance educational quality  without a Federal role and without  new Federal money. For example, it  has been estimated that to carry out  the recommendations of  just one of  these  reports-that of  the National  Commission on Excellence in Educa tion-would cost $14.1 billion, and if  one  includes the lengthening of the  school day and textbook recommenda tions,  this would cost $23.1  billion.  States  and  localities  have  already  begun to strengthen their standards  and undertake other reforms. Now it is  time for the Federal Govemment to  do its part.  Unfortunately, the Federal Govern ment  is  recently becoming a worse  partner in the educational enterprise  instead of a better one. In school year  1979-80 the Federal Government was  ",1984
1279,633,18,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, I suppose I  should  set the record straight on a couple of  things first. First, how we got this out  of committee.  I  think it is only fair to say that  since we are a 2-to-1-plus-1 minority,  the only attempt we have  to slow  things down is to not give a quorum  and that particular day we made sure  that we did not give them a quorum  and when we thought they were fin ished, one of my colleagues walked out  to pick up his books and the chairman  said now we have a quorum and we  had a quorum, and that is how this  bill came out of committee.  Second,  I  think in fairness  to the  Senate, I should respond to something  that one of the gentlemen on my side  of the aisle said, he was blaming waste  for not closing defense installations on  the Senate.  I will guarantee you, you would not  find any congresspersons in the House  of Representatives who will stand still  anytime they try to close one, and I  have been guilty of that, also. I think  we should be fair  to our colleagues  over on the Senate side.  Then I think I should also caution  those who were looking our way all  the time in relationship to what hap pened in 1981. I believe that, and that  I am not patting myself too much on  the back when I say that I had a lot to  do with not having some  things go  into a block grant.  A  lot to do with not reducing ex penditures as they were proposed in  the area of education.  In fact, all of the time we have in creased  those  expenditures  I  think  with 1 year where we stayed pretty  much the same.  But let me  talk a  little bit about  what is happening today. To me this is  probably one of the most depressing  experiences that I have had in the  Congress of the United States. I say  that primarily because I do not think  there  is anyone that has spent any  more time trying to help children, any  more time trying to provide leadership  in the area of education as  I have  during the 23 years I was in education  and since I have come to the Congress  of the United States.  And so my fear is, and the reason I  am depressed is that I am afraid we  are playing politics  today and I am  afraid we  are playing politics  and  using children, and that is depressing  tome.  First of all, when the outside spon sors of the bill spoke with me about  this bill coming to the floor, my first  question was,  is the Senate going to  act on this legislation this year and  they said, no, the best we can hope for  is that they might have a few hearings  at which point I said, then should not  we be doing something to help chil dren  this  year  before  an  election  rather  than  doing  something  that  would appear to the public as being  strictly political.  The response was that they thought,  first of all,  that if we move  in the  House perhaps things would go more  quickly next year at which point I  said, you know the political reality, as  I see it, if the incumbent is reelected, I  do not believe there will be a new $9  billion program over a 3-year period  initiated next year and if the challeng er is successful he has already indicat ed that it will be pay-as-you-go.  Now, I do not fault any of my col leagues  for whatever  philosophical  bent they may have because I believe  they are sincere. Whether  it  is big  spenders as I heard someone mention.  Whether it is  liberal or whatever it  may be, I believe they are sincere.  I lose a little respect, though, when I  hear the number of 1 minute speeches  that are given  every day  including  some of them that were given today  that really made me bite my tongue  about what we should do about defi cits and who is responsible for deficits,  et cetera. I think we should be consist ent.  I also ask as we are moving the bill  through committee, why now? Why  did this bill not come at the beginning  of  this session when everybody had  education  foremost  in  their mind;  when we would have had a beautiful  mechanism around which we  could  have built a comprehensive program  to respond to the problems that have  been brought forth through A Nation  at Risk and many of the other studies,  some of which were much better.  We would have had a golden oppor tunity instead of the piecemeal effort  that has gone forth, we would have  had a golden opportunity to bring a  comprehensive bill to the floor of the  House.  The response was that, well, we did  not want to interfere with reauthor ization of  the vocational  education  bill.  I will guarantee  you  as  long  as  Chairman Perkins was in this House  of Representatives, no one, no one was  ever going to interfere with the reau thorization of  the vocational education bill and  therefore  I  could not  accept that response from the same  people who gave me  the other  re sponse.  This bill should have come at the be ginning of the session. So, as I said, we  could have built a comprehensive pro gram. Now we have passed a math and  science bill, $1 billion over 2 years  which, incidentally, has a waiver provi sion for foreign language.  We passed and it has been signed, an  excellence in education bill, $50 mil lion over a 3-year period.  Over on our side we increased chap ter II by $200 million. We passed a for eign language bill on our side, $50 mil lion for a year. We reauthorized H.R.  11, $7 billion over a 5-year period. We  had a golden opportunity, as I said, to  build  a  comprehensive  program  to  attack the problems that are facing us  in public education.  Now, let me talk just briefly about  what I believe is the Federal role in  public education.  I feel very strongly that we do have  a role. We have a major role and that  major role is to have equal access for  all children for a good education, no  matter who they are or where they  live. That is why, as a matter of fact, I  have been a strong supporter of Head  Start, a program that is working and  working well. It got off to a bad start,  but is now working well.  That is why I have been a strong  supporter of title I and then chapter I.  And, as a matter of fact, as the amend ment that I will offer will indicate, as I  told the group who visited me in my  office, this would have been a golden  opportunity before an election to do  something  about  the  hundreds  of  thousands of dropouts that we have in  this country and will continue to have  unless we find a solution to that prob lem.  And that would not be an easy solu tion. The bill that we are considering  today will not be a short-term answer  by a  long shot to that solution. The  short-term answer, it seems to me, to  do something about the dropout prob lem is to extend that very successful  program that we have in chapter 1 so  that it can include secondary young sters. It can include secondary young sters now but to financially support  that program. It has been in operation  20 years and the best statistics that I  can find would indicate that we are  now  probably  serving  somewhere  around 48 to 50 percent of all of the  eligible youngsters. Twenty years  to  get to that point.  Now, you see, that brings me to one  of the real problems with the piece of  legislation  that we  have before us  today and that is the funding formula,  if it is not fully funded.  Let us say that it takes 20 years to  fully  fund  this piece of  legislation  then all you are doing is dribbling a  ",1984
1280,646,18,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, for  4 years, we have listened to President  Reagan promise a  balanced budget,  while all the time he has been going in  just the opposite direction and piling  up the greatest deficits in our Nation's  history.  The President has had four opportu nities to submit balanced budgets to  the Congress, yet each year's budget  has produced a larger deficit than the  year before.  On this record, what are the Ameri can people supposed to think of the  President's continued pleas for a con stitutional amendment to require en actment  of  balanced  budgets-not  now, of course, but some day in the  future after he is no longer President?  I am reluctant to think that Presi dent Reagan is stringing us along. Yet  he must know that the deficit problem  has to be faced next year, not at some  remote  future  time. He must know  that means cutting spending and rais ing  taxes. Surely  the voters have a  right to be informed, before the elec tion,  whose  programs  President  Reagan proposes  to cut and whose  taxes he proposes to raise.  Mr. Mondale has  told us how he  plans to tackle the deficit problem. It  is time Mr. Reagan leveled with the  American people as to how he plans to  do it.  In the words of conservative colum nist James J. Kilpatrick, ""Something  has to be done about our deficits, but  an  unenforceable,  unintelligible  amendment  to  the Constitution will  get us nowhere at all.""  The  full  text of Mr. Kilpatrick's  column  as  printed  in  the Akron  Beacon Journal for August 22, 1984,  follows these remarks.  AN AMENDMENT ISN'T THE WAY TO BALANCE  BUDGET  (By James J. Kilpatrick>  WASHINGTON.-Comma or no comma, on  the matter of an increase in taxes the Re publican Party platform is positively ambig uous or ambiguously positive,  take your  choice. One  is  reminded of the little old  Episcopal  lady who  loved her  toddy; she  made a  firm pledge that during Lent she  would not have a drink unless she really  needed one.  But on one  issue  in public finance  the  platform is indeed unequivocal: The Repub lican Party wants a constitutional amend ment to compel the adoption of balanced  budgets.  On this proposition,  if I may state the  matter mildly,  the Republican Party has  lost its collective mind.  It is a curious thing about Republicans about some Republicans, anyhow. They like  to think of themselves as ""conservatives,""  but they are obsessed with tinkering with  the Constitution. They are forever natter ing on about an amendment  to prohibit  abortion, or an  amendment  to prohibit  racial balance busing, or an amendment to  guarantee the right of the people voluntari ly to join in prayer in public buildings.  The President's favorite amendment is the  balanced budget amendment. It is a turkey  if there ever was one.  Oh, the basic idea is generally sound. In  principle,  the  government  in  peacetime  should match outgo to income. ""Pay as we  go!"" cried John Randolph of Roanoke a  long time ago. It sounds great. But in actual  practice the basic idea gets caught in the re fusal of Congress to separate an operating  budget from a capital budget.  Yes, operating expenses, such as the pay  of meat inspectors and the purchase of pa perclips, ideally should be met from current  income. But capital expenses, such as the  construction of a federal building or an air craft carrier, properly may be funded by  borrowing. The President's pet amendment  takes no account of these considerations.  Over the past 15 or 20 years, since talk of  a balanced budget amendment became fash ionable, at least 15 or 20 drafts of such a  resolution have been offered on Capitol  ",1984
1281,659,18,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President,  the  situation  today  is  that we have an  agreement that following the special  orders and the time set for  routine  morning business, which will end at 11  a.m.,  the rule XXII  time will start.  That will mean that the vote on clo ture, unless there is an agreement to  change  it, will  take place sometime  after 12 o'clock. Members should be  aware that that is the case.  I will confer with the distinguished  Democratic leader to see if it is possi ble to move that time to the period of  4:45 to 5 o'clock to accommodate the  majority leader who will not be back  until that time.  I did confer with the majority leader  last night. He indicated if it was not  possible, although he would like to be  here, that he understood the situation  and that we should proceed according  to the rules and get this cloture vote  completed.  It is the hope of the majority leader  that cloture will be voted, that we will  be able to complete the work on this  bill and complete it today if that is at  all possible.  I would remind the Senate that we  have  the  problems  of TV  in  the  Senate,  the  trade bill,  the highway  bill, the water resources bill, the clean  water bill, and  the product  liability  bill. We also have  the military con struction, Labor, Health and Human  Services, and the Interior appropria tion bills that are ready to go.  We are hopeful that the results of  the negotiations with the House will  lead to the adoption of the budget res olution so that the point of order that  has been raised against those bills will  no longer be proper. We expect that a  week from tomorrow the House will be  considering the continuing resolution.  That, I personally hope, will be pre ceded by  the defense  authorization  bill. But in any event, in that continu ing resolution must be foreign oper ations, Defense, Transportation, and,  if they are not acted on prior to that  time, military  construction,  Labor,  Health, and Human Services, and Inte rior appropriations. We must also com plete work on the debt ceiling bill, and  there is an agreement with the other  body that we will adjourn sine die on  October 4. So it is going to be a very  tough proposition for the Congress to  complete  the work on  this  agreed  agenda within this period of time. I  think Members should be on notice  there will be a session tomorrow, and  we will be in session late this evening.  Mr. President, I reserve the remain der of my time.

1294,672,18,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, in the  name of deregulation,  the Securities  and Exchange Commission  last De cember liberalized its regulations con cerning executive compensation disclo sure. What  they  did was  to  deny  shareholders and the investment com munity  valuable  information. Now,  those disclosure  rules had been  in  effect since 1978, and they were eased  under the rationale of reducing costs  and compliance burdens.  Mr. President, I support the admin istration's general goal o1 removing ex cesaive regulation. Three cheers; we  are all for that-do not have too much  o1 the heavy hand of Government re quiring a  -zillion  reports. But those  SEC  disclosure  recrw.rements  were  hardly burdensome. At a  time when  lllDre specific and meaningful manage ment  compensation  information  should be publicly available ..  the SEC  moved in exactly the wrong direction.  For example, the regulations that  the SEC promulgated exempt as mueh  as 10 percent of noncash remuneration  o1 an executive or $259000, whichever  is less, from disclosure. This means  that executive employees can enjoy  certain perquisites and  they do not  have to tell the stockholders at all.  Country club dues, a corporate hide away, a company car, or some little  fringe benefit can be passed on and  the people who own the corporation,  the shareholders, the people who in vested  their money will never know  about it.  Now, anyone who understands the  workings of regulations knows what  happens when the Government estab lishes a threshold for the enforcement  of any rule-all the action  tends  to  take place right outside the door. By  exempting these fringe benefits,  the  SEC has created in effect a ""free fire  zone."" Anything up to 10 percent or  is unreported, unregulat ed,  and perhaps untaxed. Further more, the current rules allow a compa ny to assign a value to such noncash  compensation based upon the burden  it places on the company rather than  the benefit that it gives the individual.  Let me  tell you what I am  talking  about.  If, for example, an executive takes  his entire family off to the company  retreat, the lodge by the lakeside, and  the whole  family  goes  along,  even  though  the value of  this vacation  could be worth thousands of dollars to  the employee,  that does not count.  the $25,000  ",1984

1297,698,18,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, I  thank  my distinguished colleague from Penn sylvania. He has been,  in  the years  that I have been chairman and before  that when  I was  ranking minority  member of  the Banking Committee,  one of the most diligent members. We  do  deal with  very  complex  issues.  What he says  is  true;  they are not  issues that are well known out on the  street. They are not easily understood.  Things we deal with are so complex  that you have to be very careful about  the  ramifications  of  legislative  changes. He  is one member of  the  committee who  certainly  has  dis charged his  responsibilities well and  with  great  attention  to  detail. He  knows  the  issues extremely well, as  well if not better than any member of  the committee. So I have high regard  for him, in that he does do his home work. We simply in this case come to a  different conclusion as a result of the  hearings. Although we disagree, I re spect his opinion. Senator HEINZ is the  type of colleague that you like to deal  with even when you do have disagree ments.  My opinions are opposite on  the  nature of the conference. Conferences  are  sometimes  difficult  with  the  House. Senator HEINZ and I have had  a particularly difficult one where we  have been on  the same side rather  than different sides for more than 4  months on the Export Administration  Act. I do not see any light at the end  of the tunnel. We simply do not under stand the House of Representatives on  those issues. We are united and will  continue to work to try to extend that  act.  On the securities issues in S. 285, we  do have sincere differences of opinion.  I will be attempting to influence the  House to accept the bill as is. I recog nize that that will be impossible, that  there will have  to be some changes,  but I will try to see that they are mini mal. I thank the Senator from Penn sylvania for his usual courtesy and his  value to me as a member of the Senate  Banking Committee.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

1302,698,18,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, in the  last several weeks I have heard a great  deal about  the banks and  insurance  powers, about South Dakota and Citi corp, about States rights and the Fed eral Bank Holding Company Act.  I  should like to take a few minutes of  the Senate's time to review the history  of this issue, and to inquire into the  nature of  the policy decision which  confronts us.  I  should  like  to move  away from slogans and turn down the  heat, if that is possible, on this debate,  by placing some of the issues in con text. My colleagues on the Banking  Committee have listened to much of  this before, but there may be some  other Senators who have not heard  quite all of the story surrounding this  issue.  There  is an anomaly  in the Bank  Holding Company Act. That much, I  think,  is  indisputable. The question  which faces the Senate today is, How  best shall we deal with the anomaly,  which has given rise to the so-called  South Dakota loophole? In order to  deal with the issue, it is important to  have some background on the nature  and history of the Bank Holding Com pany Act, and  in particular, of that  ",1984

1306,711,18,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join with my distinguished  colleague,  the  senior Senator  from  Texas [Mr. TowER],  in proposing an  amendment to correct a substantial in equity with  some  savings and  loan  shareholders  at  the Federal Home  Loan Bank Board.  Although this amendment is techni cally not germane under the rules of  cloture, it is a needed amendment.  I object most strongly  to Govern ment actions which abrogate private  contracts, and that is what the Feder al Home Loan Bank Board has done  with their August 2, 1984, final rule re garding conversion  from mutual  to  stock ownership by savings and loans.  One part of that rule retroactively  extends from 1 to 3 years the limita tion on takeovers. I believe that this  portion of the rule should be rescind ed.  The sanctity of private contracts is a  basic principal of our legal system. In  this case, conversions from mutual to  stock form which took place between  February 29, 1983, and February 23,  1984, were done under rules which lim ited takeovers for 1 year. This 1-year  limitation was clearly stated  in  the  prospectus  for  each of  these  stock  sales. The holders of the institutions  made the decision to convert knowing  that there would be a 1-year limit on  takeovers, and investors bought stock  on the strength of this assurance. The  action of  the Federal Home Loan  Bank Board in retroactively changing  this rule is unfair and has caused sub stantial  losses  to all stockholders  in  these institutions by causing immedi ate decreases  in  the price of  their  stock.  I am aware that there are arguments  on both sides of the question of take over restrictions. However, those argu ments are superseded in this case by  what I believe to be a basic and over-  riding principle of law. Severe finan cial harm has been done to the stock holders of  those  savings and  loans  which converted under the 1-year rule,  and simple justice demands that this  inequity be remedied as soon as possi ble.  Objecting  to  the consideration of  this amendment as part of this bill ob viously will  not  kill  our  proposal.  There will be other vehicles to which  this amendment could be offered, al though this is clearly the most appro priate bill for the consideration of this  issue.  Although we have made substantial  efforts during a very  long day,  it is  now apparent that the unanimous con sent that it now required to get this  amendment before the Senate will not  be forthcoming. However, I think that  there  is  substantial support  in  the  Senate for this proposal, and I intend  to work with my distinguished col league from Texas [Mr. TowER] to see  that the Senate has an opportunity to  express its sentiments in opposition to  this Federal Home Loan Bank Board  rule.  CLARIFICATION OF BANKING BILL: GLASSSTEAGALL SECTION   ",1984
1307,711,18,Mr.  TRIBLE.," Mr.  President,  in  taking action on the Senate banking  bill, S. 2851-the Financial Services  Competitive Equity Act, Glass-Stea gall prohibitions are applied for  the  first  time  to  thrift institution affili ations in section 112.  I question the  need for such an extension, particular ly in light of the fact that this issue  was not addressed during any of the  hearings or in the testimony of wit nesses who would be most affected by  the provision.  Therefore, the grandfathering of ex isting  institutions, whose affiliations  but for section 112 were lawful, should  be construed broadly.  In particular, section 112 adds a new  subsection <o> to section 408 of the Na tional Housing Act, making provisions  of sections 20 and 32 of Glass-Steagall  applicable to ""insured institutions"" as  if they were member banks.  Paragraph (2) of the subsection, as  amended by  the managers' amend ment, provides for grandfathering of  affiliations or relationships or the establishment of such officer, director,  or empolyee relationships in connec tion with any affiliation  that com menced prior to June 27, 1984. It is my  understanding  that  the grandfather  provision is not intended to ""freeze""  any company that controlled both an  insured institution and a securities un derwriter on the grandfather date so  that it could not expand those busi nesss through acquisition.  To the contrary, the intent of the  language  is  that  if a company con trolled both an insured institution and  a securities underwriter on the rele vant date,  then  it may continue  to  maintain control over both types of in stitution and may expand either or  both types, through acquisition of new  companies, merger with new compa nies, or internal growth.  In other words, what  is grandfa thered for a company controlling both  types of businesses is the basic affili ation between the two types brought  about by its common control, and not  just the affiliation between particular  subsidiaries as  they existed on  the  grandfather date.  The Senate, in taking action on S.  2851, has incorporated therein these  assumptions.e   ",1984
1308,711,18,Mr. GARN.," Internal growth is not   limited  and.  if  an  acquisition  or  merger is consistent with those activi ties grandfathered under the bill, ex pansion  is  allowed. For example,  a  grandfathered securities firm engaged  in underwriting corporate and govern mental securities would be able to ac quire another firm engaged in those  activities.  In addition, I should note that the  managers' amendment takes into ac count  the  concerns you  and other  Members have expressed concerning  the general application of Glass-Stea gall  to  thrifts. As you know, under  that amendment, the grandfather date  is moved to June 27, 1984, the date of  the markup, and affiliations between  thrifts and securities firms engaged in  certain activities, such as variable an nuity sales, mutual fund sponsorship,  and real estate security sales, would be  exempt from the Glass-Steagall prohi bitions.   ",1984
1309,711,18,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, I wish to  clarify the intent of certain provisions  of S. 2851  in order  to ensure  that  there be no misunderstanding about  them.  Section 104(e) would permit a depos itory institutions securities affiliate to  deal  in  and  underwrite  promissory  notes secured by real estate mortgages  and participation or other ownership  interests in such notes, or mortgage  related  payment  bonds  secured  by  those notes or participation interests.  In the context of this provision, the  term mortgages is intended to include  deeds of trust and other equivalent in struments which are used in place of  ",1984
1310,750,18,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to be an original cosponsor of  the  legislation  introduced  today by  Senator HEINZ which would permit  the last three gas utility holding com panies still registered under the Public  Utility Holding Company Act of 1935  [PUHCAl  to build, own, and operate  cogeneration facilities. This legislation  is similar  to a bill <H.R. 4467 > that  Representative WALGREN has already  introduced in the House.  Under present law, these three com panies-Consolidated Natural Gas Co.,  Columbia Gas System, Inc., and Na tional Fuel Gas Co.-are prohibited  from engaging in cogeneration activi ties because  the Securities and Ex change Commission [SEC] has deter mined that such enterprises are not  functionally  related  to  their public  utility functions, even though natural  gas is often used as a fuel for cogen eration.  In recent years, Congress has sought  to encourage and promote cogenera tion  development  as  an  efficient  energy source that is less threatening  to our environment than conventional  coal or oil-based generating plants.  Perhaps the most significant benefit  derived from cogeneration is that it re duces industrial energy costs by lower ing the cost of steam and electricity  through more efficient fuel use, with  savings passed on to industrial custom ers.  Although  cogeneration  technology  has existed since the turn-of-the-cen tury, it is now enjoying almost unbri dled growth in this country. Indeed,  cogeneration is likely to produce a siz able 7 percent of our Nation's electricity this year, up from just 3 percent in  1981. Industry experts believe that by  the  year  2000,  cogeneration  will  produce  15  percent  of  America's  power. Much of this growth can be at tributed  to  congressional  incentives  for the use of cogeneration, such as  those embodied in the Public Utility  Regulatory Policies Act [PURPAl of  1978.  In the Ohio Valley region, cogenera tion offers heavy industry a chance to  become more competitive by signifi cantly  reducing  production  costs.  Indeed, a recent study by the Depart ment of Energy [DOE] estimated that  cogeneration produces average energy  savings of 15 to 18 percent for the five  major  energy-consuming  industries.  For  example,  energy  accounts  for  almost 30 percent of the materials cost  of producing steel. A substantial de crease of  these energy costs would  sharply reduce the cost of steel pro duction.  Likewise,  building  supply  manufacturers,  well-dispersed  throughout the Ohio Valley, consume  even proportionately higher amounts  of energy  in assembling  their prod ucts.  In all, according  to another DOE sponsored report, widespread adoption  of cogeneration  in  the Ohio Valley  could potentially save  industry $1.29  billion of energy costs per year.  The most immediate impact cogen eration could have for the Ohio Valley  is  that by bolstering industrial com petitiveness, cogeneration could also  make a dent in the intolerably high  level of unemployment in the region.  Unfortunately, however,  the Ohio  Valley trails other areas of the Nation  in adopting cogeneration  techniques.  The paucity of development is largely  attributable to the high initial costs  for cogeneration projects which,  for  mature  industrial companies  in  the  Ohio Valley, are of lower priority than  modernizing aging plant and produc tion processes. Many other potential  investors,  both  public  and  private,  simply do not possess the substantial  financial resources needed to invest in  cogeneration projects.  This last point is of prime  impor tance due to the fact that most of the  beneficiaries of cogeneration are  in dustrial  or  commerical  consumers  which have no  interest  in  the con struction or operation of the cogenera tion  facility  itself. Rather, much of  the recent success of cogeneration has  been the result of actions undertaken  by third-parties. Some reports have in dicated  that  through  this  decade  almost  70  percent  of  cogeneration  plants will  be built by  third-party  owners.  What this amendment aims to do is  to allow these last three natural gas  utility holding companies still regis tered under PUHCA  to utilize  their  significant expertise and financial re",1984
1311,828,18,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise as  a  strong  supporter of  the Marine  Sanctuaries Program. The need for a  functional and effective program is no  less now than it was when Congress  passed the original legislation in 1972.  Indeed, the increase in human activity  in our coastal waters has made this  program even more important by al lowing for the protection of discrete  but significant areas of our coastal  waters. The richness and diversity of  our offshore areas are no less deserv ing of  responsible management and  protection  than our national parks,  wilderness areas, wildlife refuges and  other components of our  treasured  natural heritage.  It is for this reason that I am con cerned by some comments which have  been made on the House floor regard ing the legislative intent behind this  worthwhile  bill.  First,  I  feel  the  Marine Sanctuaries Amendments of  1983 speak eloquently,  in  their own  way, of the purpose intended for this  legislation. Furthermore, members of  both the House and Senate commit tees have worked diligently to clarify  the proposed law in their committee  reports.  It is correctly asserted that the Sec retary of Commerce must, according  to this legislation, determine that pro posed sanctuaries meet five standards  before they are designated. The Secre tary is also requested to consider nine  other factors in reaching his decisions.  Clearly, neither the House Merchant  Marine and Fisheries Committee nor  the  Senate  Commerce  Committee  intend that the standards set by this  bill would be so  restrictive  that no  sanctuaries would be designated. The  purpose of this legislation is to provide  for the conservation and management  of nationally significant marine areas,  not to establish insurmountable hur dles to the designation of marine sanc tuaries.  Another  issue of concern  involves  the size of areas to be designated as  marine  sanctuaries. This  legislation  authorizes the Secretary of Commerce  to ""designate any discrete area of the  marine  environment  as  a  national  marine sanctuary"" and to promulgate  appropriate regulations <sec. 303(a)).  In an earlier colloquy, it was interpret ed  that  discrete  means  ""small.""  Indeed, the true meaning of the word  and the intent in using this term, is  that a designated area be ""individually  distinct"" and easily definable in geo graphic scope and ecological, cultural  or other character. A careful review of  the bill shows clearly that a designat ed area should be limited to a ""size  and nature which will permit compre hensive and coordinated conservation  management"" <sec. 303(a)(3)). This re quirement is a hard and fast standard  that must be met by all designated  sites, and constitutes the only restric tion on the size of sanctuaries desig nated by the Secretary.  In order to make a reasonable deter mination on sanctuary designations,  the Secretary  is  required  to consult  with the House Merchant Marine and  Fisheries Committee  and with  the  Senate Commerce Committee, several  Federal agencies, State and local gov ernments,  the  appropriate Regional  Fishery Management  Council,  and  other interested persons. In no case,  however, is the Secretary required to  secure the approval of these parties-a  point clearly made by the legislation  and both House and Senate reports.  There are, however,  a number of  public and private uses of ocean re sources that could be affected by the  designation of a national marine sanc tuary, including fishing and energy de velopment.  Under  this  legislation,  public and private uses of  the  re sources in a marine sanctuary may be  allowed provided they are ""compatible  with the primary objective of resource  protection"" <sec.  30l<b)(5)). Specific  protection for fisheries <sec. 304 a 3)  and for preexisting leases and permits  <sec. 304(b)(5)) are included in the bill.  Moreover, contrary to the assertions  made in the colloquy, the existing pro tections afforded the marine environ ment by existing statutes are not nec essarily adequate for the proper man agement of valuable resources. A Con gressional Research Service report in  1980 and a 1981 General Accounting  Office  report  indicate  the Marine  Sanctuary Program can provide envi ronmental protection not otherwise  available. This finding is reinforced by  the Merchant Marine and Fisheries  Committee  report <H. Rept. 98-187,  pp. 20-21) which states:  Depending on the location, the resources,  and the existing mechanisms, a sanctuary  could either complement existing mecha nisms by filling specific gaps or could form a  management umbrella over a  fragmented  system to help coordinate diverse but relat ed efforts.  For many  reasons,  our  coastal  waters need careful and  responsible  protection. Their biological productivi ty is far more than a scientific curiosi ty, it is the underpinning of this Na tion's bountiful  fisheries  resources.  Protection of selected areas of our off shore waters is a pressing need in the  face of accelerating coastal develop ment and human activity.  Once again,  I am delighted  to see  this  important  legislation reach  this  stage on its path toward enactment. I  commend my  colleagues  in  both  Houses for their work on this bill.e   ",1984
1312,828,18,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of S. 1102, which reau thorizes and amends title III of the  Marine  Protection,  Research,  and  Sanctuaries Act of 1972.  Under  the current administration,  we have seen increased pressure to de velop  our marine  resources, more  often than not, at the expense of our  environment. The marine sanctuaries  program authorized by this bill recog nizes that ""certain areas of the marine  environment possess conservation, rec reational,  ecological,  historical,  re search, educational, or esthetic quali ties which give them special national  significance."" For the purposes of en vironmental protection and preserva tion, our National Marine Sanctuaries  Program identifies areas of the marine  environment of special national sig nificance and provides for the coordi nated conservation and management  of these areas.  The  chairman  of  the Merchant  Marine and Fisheries Committee has  indicated  that  the colloquy entered  into by  the Members managing this  bill on the House floor does not repre sent  the views of  the committee.  I  concur with the chairman.  The meaning  and  intent  of  the  Marine Sanctuaries Amendments of  1984 are amply explained in the House  report <H. Rept. 98-187) and Senate  report <S. Rept. 98-280). As the House  report  clearly  states,  these  amend ments codify the existing administra tion of  the marine sanctuaries pro gram.  As  a member  of  the Merchant  Marine and Fisheries Committee who  participated in the hearings and vote  on H.R. 2062, the companion bill to S.  1102, my understanding of congres sional  intent  in  passing  the  1984  amendments is to grant the Secretary  of Commerce unambiguous authority  to designate areas as marine sanctuar ies and adopt regulations  to protect  the natural resources of these areas.  The bill directs  the Secretary of  Commerce to consult with the House  ",1984

Eli is a selfless person  dedicated to his community-our com munity.  Eli's achievements are too numerous  to list, but I would, nonetheless, like to  25509  mention a  few. He is a member and  past president of the Bronx Chamber  of Commerce. He is chairman of the  Advisory Committee  of  the Bronx  Venture Corp., a nonprofit, local, de velopment corporation. He was presi dent of the Bronx Rotary, the Bronx  Council of the Albert Einstein College  of Medicine, as well as vice president  of the Bronx Division of the American  Jewish Committee. He was chairman  of  the  executive  committee of  the  Bronx Boys Club, and a founder and  board member of the Ponce de Leon  Federal Savings & Loan Federation.  He is still on the board of the Bronx  YMCA,  the  South Bronx Mental  Health Council, and the Bronx Dance  Theater.  During Eli's tenure as chairman of  the lay Advisory Board of the Lincoln  Hospital, he worked to obtain a com mitment for the building of the new  Lincoln Hospital Center. He has re ceived awards and recogniton from the  Red Cross, the American Legion, the  National Conference of Christians and  Jews, as well as numerous other orga nizations.  His  retail  clothing  store  in  the  Bronx has been an institution for over  30 years. I have only touched on the  many  accomplishments  of  Elias  Karmon.

1327,906,18,Mr. DELLUMS., That is correct.  ,1984
1328,906,18,Mr. KINDNESS.," And the Subcom mittee on Administration Law of the  Committee on the Judiciary has had a  concern for some time about Federal  charters and whether it is a good idea  for us to continue the practice that we  have had. This is one that has been in  existence, of course. But, as I under stand  it,  there  is  a  regular charter  under the DC  law,  too, and it is  in  good standing in  the District of Co lumbia?  ",1984
1329,906,18,Mr. DELLUMS., That is correct.  ,1984
1330,906,18,Mr. KINDNESS., So this is kind of  an extra thing like these Federal char ters  are.  I  just  raise  the question  whether the Committee on the Dis trict of Columbia might have consid ered whether it is necessary to have  such a charter continuing at all. Could  the gentleman tell me whether in this  case this does something for the cor poration that is not done under the  DC law already?  ,1984
1331,906,18,Mr. DELLUMS., I am not sure. That  is certainly not a question that this  subcommittee has  jurisdiction over.  This is a much broader question.  The only concern that this legisla tion addresses is trying to combine the  two programs into one. We did not ex plore the question of whether or not  we ought to have a Federal charter in  this  situation  or  not. We  simply  amended  the charter  to  allow  this  economy  to  take place  in order  to  allow services to be provided to several  thousand people at a much cheaper  cost by virtue of reducing  the over head with  the  combined  approach  rather than the two separate agencies.  The gentleman raises a good ques tion. It may be something that we can  look at at some future date and it cer tainly was not an issue that we looked  at at this particular point.  ,1984
1332,906,18,Mr. KINDNESS.," I thank the gentle man for yielding, and if the gentleman  would yield further I would certainly  urge that the Committee on the Dis trict of Columbia might take a look at  that in the future, as well as the Com mittee on the Judiciary, because this is  pretty much a commercial type of en terprise as contrasted to the way this  move started in 1939. It was a community based effort to get these services  together.  I  am convinced  that  it  is  much more a commercial type of en terprise today.  So I would just question whether we  ought to look into that and the exist ence of Federal charters altogether.  ",1984
1333,906,18,Mr. DELLUMS.," If I may reclaim my  time,  the gentleman makes  a  very  good point. I will see to it that the  gentleman's concerns are communicat ed  to  the appropriate subcommittee  chairperson, and we will explore this  matter.  ",1984
1334,906,18,Mr. KINDNESS., I thank the gentle man very much.  ,1984
1335,906,18,Mr. DELLUMS., I thank the gentle man and yield back the balance of my  time.  ,1984

National Memorial,  Incorporated,  ",1984
1341,932,18,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in support of H.R. 5164, the Cen tral Intelligence Agency Information  Act. We in the Intelligence Committee  like to adhere to the principle of open  government as much as we possible  can, but much of our work takes place  out of public view because we have not  found a magic way to keep the Ameri can people informed about U.S. intelli gence activities without letting hostile  foreign nations know the same things.  Even some of the public work of our  committee, such as the annual Intelli gence authorization bill, has secret as pects to it. That authorization bill is  public,  but  it doesn't contain  the  actual budgeted amounts which other  authorization bills contain.  It is  thus a great pleasure  to the  members of our committee to be able  to deal, as we have in considering H.R.  5164, with an  issue of great  impor tance in the same public and delibera tive fashion as most other legislation  in the Congress is considered.  The Intelligence Committee and the  Committee  on  Government  Oper ations have fully vetted this  legisla tion. The concerns of all have been  considered carefully and, indeed, have  been favorably addressed by the legis lation. I note that it is somewhat of a  monument  to  the  legislative process  that we have produced a bill on the  question of public access  to govern mental information that is fully sup ported by both  the Central  Intelli gence Agency and the American Civil  Liberties Union.    The bill ensures that the pubic will  continue to have access to meaningful  CIA information under the FOIA to  the full extent that they do  today.  While preserving such access, the bill  rationalizes  the FOIA administrative  process at CIA so that the CIA is not  required to spend time and taxpayers'  money  reviewing and  justifying  the  withholding of its most sensitive oper ational records that everybody agrees  are  properly  classified  and must  remain  secret.  The  taxpayers'  re sources allocated to CIA-FOIA activities will instead be employed produc tively in reviewing CIA records which  may contain information which can be  released to the public. This is a good  government bill-it should save some  money  for  the  taxpayers,  speed up  service to the members of the public  who make FOIA requests, and improve  operational  security  in U.S.  intelli gence activities, all while preserving  undiminished the amount of meaning ful CIA information available to the  public under the FOIA.  Mr. Speaker,  I will vote  for H.R.  5164 and I ask my colleagues to join  me.e  e ",1984
1342,932,18,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  to commend the efforts of my friend  and colleague  from New York, Mr.  WEISS, to inject some necessary clarity  into the debate on exempting the CIA  from certain Freedom of Information  Act reviews.  I  join him  in opposing  passage of H.R. 5164.  Clearly, in the interests of national  security, some CIA information should  not  be  automatically  available  for  public  consumption. The committee  makes that point in its report. Howev er, over the past several years there  has been an accelerating trend away  from public scrutiny and toward Gov ernment secrecy in cases of CIA  in volvement where security interests are  not demonstrated, a  trend  I believe  threatens the public's right to know.  Classification of CIA documents has  become the norm, rather than the ex ception. Such actions should not be  encouraged by  legislating  indiscrimi nate protection of classified files.  Most dangerous,  this bill seeks  to  limit scrutiny of even the decision to  classify by curtailing the rights of citi zens to judicial review of a CIA deci sion to withhold classified information  from release under the FOIA. Why is  this necessary? Proponents of the bill  claim  it will  facilitate  response  to  other FOIA requests, ones that do not  involve classified operational files, by  eliminating the 2-year backlog of re quests for classified information. But  if judicial review is eliminated, what is  to  prevent  greater  and  greater  amounts of  information  from being  placed in these protected files?  Under current  law,  the CIA  is al lowed to protect classified information  from FOIA review. But should there quester suspect that some information  has been unnecessarily or unjustly  classified, a judge may order and con duct a private-in camera-review of  the material to determine its sensitivi ty. As Representative WEiss pointed  out,  the courts have almost always  ruled in favor of the agency in such  cases, and there has never been an un authorized release of documents under  this procedure. What can we expect if  this right of review is curtailed?  Rather  than  speeding  the FOIA  process, we would be sanctioning the  classification of materials that in the  past have been crucial to the discovery  of numerous illegal operations of the  CIA, from the domestic surveillance of  activists  to  the mining  of  foreign  ports. It is possible to adjust require ments for access to sensitive material  without legislating blanket exemption  to an already recalcitrant agency  to  proceed without public checks. It is an  abdication  of  our  responsibility  to  uphold the practice of open Govern ment to allow greater secrecy for an  agency that has repeatedly betrayed  the public in its undertakings.

1353,945,18,Mr. BAKER.," Mr.  President,  the  Senate convenes today pursuant to an  order which provides that the reading  of the Journal will be dispensed with,  as well as the call of the calendar, and  that no  resolutions will  come over  under the rule. The morning hour, by  unanimous consent, is deemed to have  expired.  After the two leaders are recognized  under the standing order, there will be  one special order, to be followed by  time  for  the  transaction of  routine  morning business until 12:30.  After that, by unanimous consent,  there will be 2 hours of debate on the  motion to proceed to consideration of  the TV in the Senate resolution. Sena tors should be reminded that time for  debate is provided by unanimous con sent, because the motion itself is not  pending, having expired with the ad journment of the Senate on Friday.  However. since a cloture motion was  filed pursuant to rule XXII, a vote will  occur on cloture in respect to debate  on the motion to proceed on tomor row, Tuesday.  If that vote  succeeds,  the motion  itself will then be pending, under the  provisions of the rule, for debate after  cloture.  Mr. President, I hope cloture will be  invoked tomorrow; but in the event it  is not, it is anticipated by the leader ship on this side that a second cloture  motion will be filed  today. either by  remaking the motion or by unanimous  consent, a matter which I have not dis cussed with the minority leader, but I  will do so.  There is a possibility that the trade  bill will come up after the first 2 hours  of debate on the TV  in  the Senate  matter. That would be at approxi mately 2:30 p.m.  I anticipate that the Senate will be  in session for normal hours today.  Mr. President, as I did last Monday,  I believe it would be a good  idea to  review the agenda that is still before  us and the absolutely essential items  that must be dealt with before Con gress can adjourn sine die. They are  the debt limit, which must be done by  September 28,  I  am advised by  the  Secretary of the Treasury; a continu ing resolution making appropriations  for the agencies and departments of  Government as  they may not have  been provided for by regular appro priation  bills.  Those may  include  MilCon,  Labor-HHS,  Interior-Trans portation. If conference  reports are  not completed on other appropriation  bills, they may be included, as well.  In addition  to  the debt  limit and  continuing resolution and appropria tion bills,  these are on  the  list of  things that the leadership on this side  would  like  to do: TV  in the Senate,  which  I have already discussed;  the  civil  rights bill,  the so-called Grove  City bill;  the highway bill,  including  an interstate construction estimate; a  trade  bill, which  I  announced  for  today; a clean water bill; product li ability; water resources; nominations  as they may be available, and confer ence reports as they become available.  That is a considerable list, and I am  not sure how far we will get. But it is  the intention of the leadership, both  here and in the House of Representa tives, I believe, to try to meet an Octo ber 4 adjournment date. The 5th of  October had been announced previous ly. but because of a religious holiday  that begins on the 5th, it is the hope  of the leadership that we can adjourn  sine die on October 4. I have discussed  this with the Speaker, who has indi cated a similar desire.  Mr. President, I will continue to out line the agenda for the remaining 3  weeks of this session as it appears to  me, and I will make every effort to  keep  the Senate advised and up  to  date.

1366,984,18,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President,  I  support the amendment offered by my  colleagues  to  clarify  congressional  intent regarding the escape clause pro visions of the Trade Act of 1974. The  need for this legislation was dramati cally demonstrated  recently by  the  International Trade Commission's de cision to deny import relief to the non rubber footwear industry.  I am very concerned about the criti cal condition of the footwear industry  nationwide, and especially in Mississip pi where there are five shoe plants em ploying 2,025 workers  in the north eastern part of the State. But, just re cently, the Brown Shoe Co. in Boone ville, MS, announced it will be closing  its doors, laying off about 400 workers,  many of whom have never worked  anywhere else.  The domestic  footwear  industry  is  beseiged by foreign imports which now  account for over 70 percent of the do mestic  nonrubber  footwear market.  The U.S.  shoe  industry  lost 110,000  jobs in the past 15 years and domestic  production has declined by 50 percent.  Hundreds of factories have closed, and  the unemployment rate in this indus try is twice the national average. Yet  the International Trade Commission  refused  to find  that the industry  is  being  seriously  injured or  is  being  threat-ened with  serious  injury  by  reason of increased imports.  The amendment proposed would re quire the lTC to review all criteria of  the Trade Act's escape clause provi sions, and not deny import relief be cause an impacted industry may fail to  meet one of the indicators of injury.  This legislation is important to the  footwear industry and to other domes tic industries that have been adversely  affected by the surge of foreign  im ports.  I support the amendment offered by  Senator CoHEN and others and urge its  adoption.  ",1984

The business was pur chased  from Pfizer under an Employee  Stock Ownership Plan <ESOP>. All the em ployees, eighty-eight in number, will partici pate in the ownership of the business.  Our product line consist of the manufac ture and sale from Greensboro of specialty  organic chemicals. We make organic inter mediates for the textile, adhesive, food film,  cosmetic, and insect repellent industries.  As you may be aware, Catherine Bennett  of Pfizer's Washington Office recently met  with Scott Wilson of your staff to discuss a  tariff problem on our behalf. This discus sion focused upon our interest in the intro duction of  legislation  regarding  the U.S.  import tariff on meta-toluic acid, an impor tant raw material to our production at Mor flex. Mr. Wilson suggested that we provide  you directly with the following background  information which explains why we believe  a suspension of the current duty on meta toluic acid is justified.  1. Meta-toluic acid is reacted with diethyl amine  to  form N'N-diethyl M-toluam.ide  <DEET> which is widely known as an insect  repellant.  2. The only country we have  imported  from in the past five years is Japan. The  substance is also produced in Germany. We  have not been made aware of any imports  into  the U.S. However, we are aware of  DEET being shipped to the U.S. at a lower  tariff than that of meta-toluic.  3. The import tariff on meta-toluic acid is  1.7 cents per pound plus 17.9% ad valorem.  The import tariff on the finished product,  DEET, is 1.5 cents per pound plus 12.5% ad  valorem. The resulting price differential in  the finished product has led some U.S. firms  to purchase DEET from Germany rather  ",1984

1381,997,18,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President,  I  previously brought to the attention of  my colleagues my support for legisla tion that will authorize the negotia tion of  free  trade area agreements  with Israel and Canada.  I consider this legislation to be very  important to our goal of promoting  international free trade. The nations  of Israel and Canada are two of our  most  important allies, and bilateral  trade  agreements will  enhance our  friendly relations and offer expanded  opportunities for U.S. exporters. The  authorization of negotiations will be  another  positive  expression  of our  commitment to opening and expand ing  trade  opportunities,  promoting  economic growth, and strengthening  our international trading system.  I believe the benefits will be signifi cant for U.S. producers and manufac turers.  In his  testimony before  the  Senate Finance Committee, Ambassa dor Bill Brock outlined the projected  gains from such an agreement with  Israel. The United States has a trade  surplus with  Israel even  though 90  percent of U.S.  imports from  Israel  enter duty free. Under a  free  trade  agreement, we would essentially elimi nate duties on the remaining 10 per cent of our imports from Israel. In ex change, the 40 to 45 percent of our ex ports that are now subject to duties  averaging about 10.3 percent would  also become duty  free. Demand for  U.S. products  in Israel has suffered  since  the European Community and  Israel negotiated a  free  trade area  agreement in 1977. A free trade area  agreement between the United States  and Israel would place our exports on  par with those from the EC. Addition ally,  agricultural  exports,  such  as  grains and soybeans, could  increase  significantly.  The administration further proposes  to negotiate the elimination of nontar iff barriers which hinder U.S. exports  to Israel and address the issue of Is raeli subsidy practices. Rules of origin  and safeguards  for  import sensitive  products will be discussed. Finally, the  administration plans to consult with  private sector advisors and conduct ex tensive research on the economic ef fects of eliminating duties on products  now dutiable.  The United States and Canada are  each other's largest  trading partner  now. A  free  trade agreement,  even  though product limited, will enhance  our existing trade relationship.  Mr. President, the Senate is consid ering this important measure in con junction with H.R. 3398, the miscella neous trade bill. This bill also contains  other important trade initiatives such  as  the additional authority  for  the  President  to seek  reciprocity  in our  trading relations.  I urge my colleagues to consider this  legislation favorably as soon as possi ble.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence  of a quorum.  ",1984

1391,997,18,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, at  noon  today,  the 17th of September  1984, in an auspicious golden sunlight  which bathed the Mall he so greatly  helped  to  create, S. Dillon Ripley  stepped down as the eighth Secretary  of  the Smithsonian  Institution. He  therefore assumed the title of ""Direc tor Emeritus.""  Mr. President, it was an altogether  pleasing  and  appropriate  ceremony.  The Chief Justice presided in his role  as Chancellor of the Smithsonian In stitution. The distinguished members  of the Board, the regents, were there.  I noted  in particular our colleagues,  Senator SASSER  and Senator GARN,  both regents, and others of the Senate  and House who were on hand for the  occasion.  Mr. Robert McCormick Adams suc ceeds Mr. Ripley, and of him there will  be many gracious things to be said in  the years ahead.  I would like for the moment to com ment on  the extraordinary 20-year  career of Dillon Ripley.  An old adage from the classical role  says of Augustus that he found Rome  made of brick and left it marble. Many  years later in the period of the Regen cy  in England,  it was said of King  George's architect John Nash,  in a  little couplet which  appeared,  that  London, too, had met its master who  found it brick and left it plaster.  One wonders about such transform ing geniuses. They are rare, and when  they do arrive, they are rarely forgot ten.  It might be said of Dillon Ripley  that, prompted by  a  private omen  found it Attic, left it Roman.  The Smithsonian was indeed a ven erable but musty Institution when he  came to this town in 1964. ""The Na tion's attic"" was a term of endearment,  but also rather alarmingly descriptive  and accurate. The Mall was unsettled,  undeveloped;  Pennsylvania  Avenue  was derelict. The center of Washing ton was seeking to float out Wisconsin  or Massachusetts Avenue, in the tradi tion of present-day cities, where devel opers  look  for  large plots  in new  neighborhoods.  The prospect of the Capitol becom ing isolated, surrounded by rundown  properities of no interest to anyone,  was  reminsicent  of  an  earlier  age  rather than of what is required by the  almost constitutional manner in which  the city of Washington is laid out with  the Capitol as  its center,  the  great avenues radiating from  it, and  that most particular one, Pennsylva nia A venue, moving from here to the  President's House, as it was called in  L'Enfant's plan-this being the Con gress' house. That was all in jeopardy,  and much else. Dillon set to work with  an energy, a vision, and a capacity for  joy that has not been equaled in this  century in this city. It is hard to think  of the differences in the city which he  first came to and the one which he  does not so much  leave behind, but  has transformed. Then there was no  Anacostia Museum,  no Hirshhom  Museum and Sculpture Garden, no  U.S. Air and Space Museum. The  Patent Office, that great sculpture of  the early Republic, was about to be  ",1984

1405,1075,18,Mr. BEILENSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to take a moment to draw  my colleagues' attention to the plight  of  long-time  refusenik  Aleksandr  Yakir and  to commend an unprece dented coalition of Jewish leaders and  Christian,  civil  rights,  peace  and  human rights groups for their actions  on Mr. Yakir's behalf.  Aleksandr Yakir  and his parents  have been trying to emigrate from the  Soviet Union since October 1973 and  for  the past 7 years, Aleksandr has  been filing for exit permission on his  own. Aleksandr has been refused per mission on  ""humanitarian grounds""  because the authorities ""do not want  to split up families."" In addition, Alek sandr has been convicted of draft eva sion and now faces up to 3 years of im prisonment: it is ironic that Aleksandr  refused to be inducted into the mili tary because he did not want to be ex posed to ""state secrets,""  thus giving  the Soviets further excuse  to delay  granting him permission to emigrate.  Aleksandr's plight has been given  special  attention by members of  a  unique coalition of leaders who have  recently sent cables to Soviet officials  protesting his arrest, trial, and convic tion on charges of draft evasion. The  group has also urged the Soviet Gov ernment  to grant  the Yakir  family  permission to immigrate to Israel.  I  am glad  that  the coalition has  added some new voices to the cause of  Soviet Jewry, and I urge them, along  with all of us in the U.S. Congress, to  continue speaking out for the rights of  Soviet Jews such as Aleksandr Yakir.e  TRffiUTE TO LINDA THERESA  GARCIA  HON.

1406,1075,18,Mr. MARTINEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to pay tribute to a very special  person, Linda Theresa Garcia. Linda  Garcia grew up in a military family  where she learned early on about the  rigors  and  pains  associated  with  moving every few years. However, her  travels also served to enrich her life  through new friendships and broader  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  cultural experiences. Linda graduated  from high school in Massachusetts in  1976 after having lived and traveled  throughout  the United States  and  Puerto Rico.  In 1976, Linda made history when  she was 1 of 156 young women to enter  with the first class to include women  at the U.S. Air Force Academy. Four  years later, and with only 88 women  remaining, Linda graduated with  a  bachelor of science degree in political  science/international affairs, with  a  minor in engineering. During her third  summer at the Academy, Linda earned  her military parachute wings.  After graduation, Captain Garcia at tended  the Air  Force  Intelligence  School at Lowery Air Force Base,  Denver, CO, and was subsequently as signed to the Latin American branch  in  the Defense  Intelligence Agency  [DIAl  in Washington, DC, from No vember 1980 to September 1983. As an  intelligence  research  specialist  for  Latin America, her work involved anal ysis  of  the military  capabilities of  Latin American countries. From  the  beginning of April through June 1982,  Captain Garcia was assigned  to  the  Falkland  Islands  Intelligence Task  Force at the Pentagon as the military  analyst for Argentina. In that assign ment  Captain  Garcia  personally  briefed  senior military  and  civilian  personnel in the Department of De fense,  including the Secretary of De fense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In  February 1983, Captain Garcia was  awarded the Joint Service Commenda tion Medal for her work during the  Falkland Islands crisis.  In September 1983, Captain Garcia  was assigned for 3 months to the Cen tral America Joint Intelligence Team  (CAJITl at the Pentagon, a  special  DIA task force monitoring the current  tactical military situation in Central  America.  From December 1983 to June 1984,  Captain Garcia worked in the Office  of the Secretary of Defense, where she  was assigned to the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Equal Oppor tunity  and Safety Policy.  In  that  office, Captain Garcia liaisoned with  the White House on a special nonpar tisan project for  the Department of  Defense.  In mid-June, Captain Garcia  re turned to the Central America Joint  Intelligence Team, where she is now  working in the Pentagon.  In addition to her normal duty re sponsibilities, Captain Garcia is an ad missions liaison officer for the USAF  Academy and AFROTC. In that capac ity she visits high schools throughout  the District of Columbia, Maryland,  and Virginia, encouraging young men  and women to further their education  beyond  high  school.  Additionally,  Linda is the treasurer for the Penta gon IMAGE Chapter, an organization  dedicated to the professional promo25691  tion  and advancement of Hispanic American employees  in  the Depart ment of Defense.  Linda has received numerous awards  and honors from the Office of the Sec retary of Defense, the Defense Intelli gence Agency, and various national  Hispanic organizations for her contri butions as a pioneer Hispanic woman  and as a role model for young men and  women.  In March 1980, during her  senior year at  the Academy, Cadet  Garcia was named Woman of the Year  by the Mexican American Opportunity  Foundation  in Los Angeles, and  in  1981, Linda was honored as Woman of  the Year by the National Conference  of Puerto Rican Women  in Boston.  Also, Linda has been named an Out standing Young Woman of America  for 1983.e  TRIBUTE TO TARAS  SHEVCHENKO  HON. MARIO BIAGGI  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 1984   Mr. BlAGG!. Mr. Speaker, yester day Ukrainians from across this coun try gathered  in Washington, DC,  to  pay  tribute  to Taras Shevchenko, a  19th century Ukrainian poet and artist  who helped to develop Ukrainian na tionalism. At this time, Mr. Speaker, I  would like to say a few words in honor  of this great man and to recognize the  symbolic significance of his work in re lation to the present day struggle of  the Ukrainian people  to break  free  from the yoke of Soviet tyranny.  The deep emotion and nationalistic  fervor evoked in Taras Shevchenko's  work has given each successive genera tion of Ukrainians a boundless source  of  inspiration and hope. At a  time  when freedom of speech  in Ukraine  and all other basic human freedoms  have been brutally suppressed,  this  tribute  takes on great meaning. By  honoring  the memory of  this great  man-who  stands  as  a  symbol  of  Ukrainian nationalism and freedom we also recognize the sad fact that the  Ukrainian people have been forced to  live under the brutality and repression  of Soviet rule for over 60 years. For  over 60 years the Soviet Union has  tried to crush the spirit of the Ukrain ian people. In 1932 the Soviet Govern ment committed one of the most hei nous crimes against humanity ever re corded-as they intentionally starved  to death thousands of Ukrainian peas ants who resisted collectivization. The  Great Famine in the Ukraine of 1932  and 1933  is but one example of the  type of repression and inhumanity the  Ukrainian people have suffered at the  hands of the Soviet Government.  The  history  of  Soviet  rule  in  Ukraine has been a tragic one. But de",1984
1407,1088,18,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President. the Sep.  tember 18 edition of the Washington  Post reports that key administration  officials are prepared  to advise  the  President with  respect  to steel  im ports. The levels. of relief reported to  be favored by the administration are  inadequate.  Steells vital to the national security  of the United States. A comprehen sive, long-term strategy that requires  investments  in  modernizations  needed to prevent the involuntary liq uidation of America's steel industry.  The Fair Trade in Steel Act is such a  proposal. That legislation, of which I  am a cosponsor, would provide for a  15-percent quota over a period of 5  years. Yesterday, former Vice Presi dent Mondale  proposed  a  sim1lar  meaningful long-term strategy-coverls  tng 5  years.  I  believe-to preserve  America's steel industry. Mr. Mondale  proposed 17 -percent quotas over a 5year period, as I have indicated, cou pled with a  strong commitment  to  modernization on the part of the steel  industry.  I commend Mr. :Mondale for his pro posal. I certainly hope that the admin istration wlll go further than has been  reported and provide meaningful relief  for unfairly damaged domestic steel  makers. Meaningful relief for steel wlll  benefit West Vlrglnla and other States  by providing  jobs  for  thousands of  Americans.  Recently, when Mr. Mondale was on  the Hill, I  took occasion-and he very  kindly gave me the occasion-to speak  with him briefly about the problems  that the .steel industry is having, not  only  throughout the country, but I  spoke with particular reference to the  problems  that  the steel  industry  having in West Vlrglnia. Meaningful  relief for steel wlll benefit West Vlr glnlans and other States by providing  jobs for thousands of Americans.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have printed in the REcoRD the  Washington Post article  to which  have  referred,  entitled  ""19% Steel  Import Limit Favored,'' with a sub heading.  ""Key Officials  to Advise  Reagan.""  There being no objection, the article  was ordered  to be printed  in  the  RBCORD, as follows:  ls  I  19% STDL IIIPoRT LnnT FAVOllED-KEY  0PriCIALS To ADVISE Ru.GAB  rullng  <By Stuart Auerbach>  Ke:y admlnlstratlon officials w1ll advise  President Reagan  today  to  force  foreign  steel suppliers to cut back their Imports to  about 19 percent of the U.S. market, admin Istration and industry sources revealed yes terday.  That option Is one of four that w1ll reach  the president u  a Saturday deadllne nears  for a declslon on one of the most sensitive  political and eeonomlc  Issues confronting  him this election year: how much trade pro tection to give American steel makers. The  deadllne wu forced b:y an  International  Trade Commission  that American  steel makers are suffering substanttal harm  from Imports.  Imports averaged 24.2 percent of the U.S.  market for the first six months of this year,  but surged to a record 33 percent in July.  None of the options presented by the Cab inet-level task force Is likely to satlsf:y the  American steel makers, who called an emer gency meeting of their trade 88880Ciatlon  executive committee for this momlng to in tensify their lobb:ylng efforts. <The industry  wants comprehensive 15 percent quotas on  Imported steeL>  A 19 percent  l1m1t on steel Imports  Is  being pushed b:y Commerce Secretary Mal colm Baldrige. Other officials, led b:y Office  of Management and Budget Director David  A. Stnckman, still were arguing yesterday  that such a solution would be too protec tionist. High-level  admJnlstratlon  sources  said the Stockman group, which includes  Deputy Treasury Secretary R. T. McNamar,  would prefer to leave Imports at about 24  percent.  Stockman and president assistant Richard  G. Darman reportedly met over most of :yes terday with steel industry officials. Also in  those meetings wu Deputy U.S. Trade Rep resentative Robert E.

Although  the Commerce Department's  plan to l1m1t Imports wu reported :yesterday  to have strong support, sources said  the  strong disagreement within the admlnistra tlon on the eve of toda:y's meeting of the  Cabinet Council on Commerce and Trade  made the situation ""fiuld""  The 19 percent l1m1t on Imports has been  mentioned to foreign governments, accord ing to representatives of overseas suppllers,  however. But other l1m1ts, ranging u  low u  18 percent, also have been mentioned, ad m.lnlstratlon and industry sources said.  The Commerce plan does not go u  far u  setting a global quota, which the admJnls tration hu opposed strongly in the put,  and any l1m1ts are listed u  ""targets.""  The key to the Commerce option lies in  negotiations with ke:y exporting nations to  force cuts in their steel sales to the United  States.  Chief among these suppliers are the newly  industr1allzed Third World nations of Brazll  and Korea, whose steel exports have surged  over the put :years. Other negotiated order ly marketing agreements are likely to be  sought with Spain, another new supplier to  the United States, and possibly SWeden, ad mlnlatration sources said  Korean steel amounts to about 11 percent  of all U.S. steel Imports, whUe Brazll ~  counts for 7 percent.  Under this option, the Reagan admlnistra tlon would use the leverage of the ITC deci sion in Its negotiations with Brazil, Korea  and any other nation it wants to include in  theOMAs.  The admlnistration already has trade re strictions in force with the European Eco nomic Community and Is likely to extend  those to cover products such u  pipe and  tubes, where Imports have Jumped marked ly, sources said  In an attempt to satisfy the industry. the  Commerce plan calls for formalJzlng volun tary restraints that Canada and Japan al ready have on  their  sales  to  the U.S.  market. These could  include asldng for a  rollback from Japan, whose  Imports  year are almost twice what they were in  1983.  The option  favored  b:y  the Stockman  forces would call for  looser arrangements  with Importing nations and would not rely  on the ITC decision for leverage in negotia tions,  administration sources said There  also would be no wa:y  the admJnlstration  could force suppliers to keep to any negoti ated l1m1ts.

I want to commend my col league for preparing the amendment,  and offering it. I want to indicate my  great willingness  to  cosponsor  the  effort. Clearly, the situation in the do mestic copper industry is extremely se rious. We are all,  I believe-at least  those of us  from  copper-producing  States-disappointed by  the decision  of the President not to go along with  proposals or recommendations made  by the International Trade Commis sion with regard to copper. But clear ly,  the real solution to the problem  lies  in  the  reduction of production  worldwide. We  have more  supply  today  than we  have  demand  for  copper.  Something must be done  to bring  supply into line with demand. I believe  the negotiations which are called for  in this amendment would accomplish  that. I urge my colleagues to support  the amendment.  Thank you, Mr. President.  ",1984

1425,1114,18,Mr. MELCHER.," Mr. President, the  amendment that is before us  is  the  least we could do for the copper indus try in this country. The results are the  President's decision of  a  few  days  ago-a very damaging blow in not fol lowing the recommendations, at least  one of the recommendations, made by  the International Trade Commission.  What we have before us in this coun try-it is sad to say-is a dying indus try. That is pretty tough for a lot of us  to take. Those of us who come from  areas of the country where copper is  produced  know what  it means  in  is  heartaches for those families who no  longer have  jobs, or whose  jobs are  made very insecure. But it is extreme ly  important for  the United States  that we retain the domestic copper in dustry for the benefit of all of us in  this country. We are right at the cross roads of losing the last remnants of  the domestic copper industry in our  country.  What  the amendment  suggests  that an effort be made for negotia tions between the President through  the International Trade Commission,  and the individual countries. I do not  think it is enough. I do not think any  of us who come from copper areas  here in the United States believe that  it is enough, but it is the least we can  do in this particular bill.  I hope it is accepted by the entire  Senate. I hope the results of it-after  it is passed and enacted into law-are  beneficial for us.  ",1984

It is regrettable the Senate is  forced to take this action. I am disap pointed that the President has chosen  to ignore the recommendations of the  International Trade Commission that  relief should be provided to our do mestic copper producers. I  think the  copper industry has made a very con vincing case that relief is necessary to  revive a very depressed industry. The  President's actions are  terribly mis guided. Allowing  foreign nations  to  dump subsidized copper on our U.S.  market is contrary to the best inter ests of our Nation. As long as our Gov ernment  continues  to  ignore  the  unfair competition from abroad,  the  long-term outlook for areas such as  my home of Grant County, NM,  is  very bleak.  I will not allow our copper industry  to be abandoned. It appears the ad ministration  is more  interested  in  showing concern for Chile's debt to  American banks than for the AmeriI  ",1984

Schaffer, Assistant  Commissioner, Department  of  the  Treasury, U.S. Customs Service, be  printed at this point in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to be printed  in  the  REcoRD, as follows:  u.s. CUSTOMS SERVICE,  Hon. J. JAMES ExoN,  Washington, DC, September 18, 1984.  DEPARTMENT OF THE TREAsURY,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR ExoN: Thank you for your  letter of August 27, 1984, concerning there vised version of S. 2428 which will be consid ered by the full Senate as part of the Omni bus Miscellaneous Tariffs bill.  The revised language in S. 2428 for pro posed tariff item 653.43 would provide for  tapered steel pipes or tubes that are chiefly  used as parts of illuminating articles.

""Chief use"" is statutorily defined in Gen eral  Interpretative Rule  19<e>(i), Tariff  Schedules of the United States <19 U.S.C.  1202), as that use which exceeds all other  uses (if any) combined. Use is determined by  the use in the United States, at or immedi ately prior to the date of importation, of ar ticles of that class or kind to which the im ported articles belong.  If we  can provide  further  please do not hesitate to call us.  Sincerely,  assistance,  ROBERT P. ScHAPFER,  Assistant Commissioner  (Commercial Operations).  ",1984
1433,1140,18,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I  thank  the chair and the managers of the bill  for their assistance on this matter.  Mr. Pre~ident, as we consider this  major piece of trade legislation, it is  important to note that yesterday the  dollar made its largest single-day advance in recent years. The dollar hit  an  lllh-year high against  the West  German mark, a new high against the  French franc, a new high against the  high  7-year  British  pound  and  a  against the Swiss franc.  In the last 2 weeks along, the U.S.  dollar has appreciated an  incredible  6.7 percent against the mark and 5.8  percent against the British pound.  While  the  President  labels  the  strength of the dollar as the ""Ameri can miracle"" and the Secretary of the  Treasury is untroubled by the hyper valued dollar, I must express my grave  concern.  This year the American balance-of trade will be a record $130 bllllon in  deficit. America's  standing  in  the  international marketplace cannot im prove until the value of the dollar re turns to traditional levels.  U.S. exporters especially American  farmers are daily seeing foreign mar kets  close  due  to  the  high-valued  dollar.  The current state of affairs in Amer ica is a direct result of the irresponsi ble budgetary practices of the last few  years. Some would have the American  public believe that the deficit-financed  recovery comes at no price. The price  of the uneven recovery is high interest  rates, high values of the dollar and the  loss of international competitiveness.  When the Senate completes its work  on this legislation, many will proclaim  the benefits  this bill will have on  America's international trade position.  I submit that all of the tariff bills in  the world will not significantly affect  our Nation's trade balance until we  forthrightly address the budget issue.  The  trade balance  figures  signal  a  warning that must be heeded.  Massive Federal borrowing increases  the demand  for credit: Thereby  creasing  nominal  and  real  interest  rates. High real interest rates act as a  magnet for foreign investment which  in  turn  increases  the value of  the  dollar. Low domestic savings create a  dependence on foreign investment and  the need for attractive interest rates.  High interest rates place additional de mands on the budget. This seamless  web must be torn down.  International tariff schedules pale in  comparison  to  the unmentioned  tax  imposed on American exports by an  over-valued dollar which has increased  over 50 percent in the last 3 years.  Simllarly, the hyper-valued dollar sub sidizes  foreign products sold  in  the  United States.  The loss of foreign markets and the  flow of  imports creates  the demand  for  reactionary  policy  rather  than  long-term strategies. A mood of pro tectionism  is beginning to take hold  across America. This week, we have  heard the cries of the textile, auto,  steel, and footwear industries.  Unwilling to address the root problem in a manner that will help all sec tors of the economy, the administra tion has made several short-sighted,  politically  expedient  actions. Most  in ",1984
1434,1153,18,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President,  I  think if there is a question of equity  and fairness in the action of the Chair  in recognjzing the Senators, that is an  independent problem we should deal  with without respect  to whether or  not we are going to televise proceed ings. I think if we televise proceedings  it will put every presiding officer, in cluding a Vice President of the United  States, on his mark to be fair. But  even if we are not televising, if the  Senator from Louisiana honestly be lieves that the Chair is being partial  and biased,  then we had better do  something about that whether or not  we televise the proceedings.

1450,1153,18,Mr. GOLDWATER.," Thank you.  Mr. President, originally I was op posed to televising the Senate. Then  when I  learned of the various ways  YOU can manipulate the CONGRESSION AL REcoRD, I came out in favor of tele vising. But after watching what hap pened in the House through the ef President,  how  Mr.  forts of the House  leader,  I  turned  81-059 {)-87-37 (Pt. 18)  it can  it because  against  televising  happen here.  Mr. President,  in the debate  that  was just going on between my friend  from Maryland and my friend from  Louisiana relative to the camera. Yes,  there can be a camera located some place in here that can pick up each in dividual Member. But it is going to be  an ungainly thing. It is going to be a  big affair. I do not know where they  are going to put it. They have the  technical problem of getting the Sena tor from New Mexico way over in that  comer, and getting the majority or mi nority leader right down here. That  can be done. But we have some other  things to consider, Mr. President. I do  not think we have taken them into  consideration.  I  see my friend  from  West Virginia coming in. We do not  have any order in this Senate. When  we have votes here, they are all gath ered down there in the well. How are  we  going  to educate  the American  people about what goes on here when  you have got a mob scene going on?  Do we want the American people to  think that we run this country by a  mob scene? I have sat in that chair  and begged, and begged, and begged  my colleagues  to sit down  and be  quiet. But they will not do it. Until we  pass a resolution or a rule change as  suggested by my friend from West Vir ginia, we are not going to get order. He  merely suggests that we vote from our  desks, which I always thought was the  order when I came here. But after my  cliff-hanging election back  in 1964,  when I came back I discovered they  had changed everything. Now it is the  rule by mob down here. That is not  going to look good to the American  people. A lot of the other things we do  in this body like running up and put ting our speech  in  the RECoRD,  or  saying, ""Mr. President, I ask unani mous consent,"" after reading one line,  ""that this appear as if I read it""; is  that the kind of education we want to  give the American people? They will  think this is the phoniest bunch of  people  they have  ever  seen. They  might not be far from wrong. But we  do not want them to think that.  So, Mr. President, I am in opposition  to this. I do not think we are ready for  it. I think we have to get this Senate  back in some kind of order in the way  we operate before we can talk about  showing the American people how we  operate. Then there is another ques tion. Who is going to carry it? Cable  News Network, one network is going to  this. The  three big networks,  God bless  their little no-good souls,  they are not going to carry it. So we  are confined to a fine system. I  like  Cable News Network. It is probably  the best thing in the country. But it is  only one. We talk about that. That is  monopoly. So the first thing you know  carry  we have a  lawsuit going on because    Cable News is the only one that will do  it.  So, Mr. President, I very reluctantly  dislike opposing my leader on his last  official duty. But I  think as he sits  down there in the hills of Tennessee  and watches what he would watch on  television, he would say, ''My God, was  I in that outfit at one time?"" [Laugh ter.]  ",1984

1456,1153,18,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, as one  who sponsored one of the earliest reso lutions to open the Senate floor to TV,  I congratulate the distinguished Sena tor from Maryland as well as our ma jority  leader  for  their  efforts  to  modify the rules. I think it is an im portant reform. I  listened with great  care to the distinguished Senator from  Arizona. There is much truth in some  of the criticisms he made. However, it  is my opinion  that if we open  the  Senate to public viewing, perhaps the  kind of debate we will witness on the  Senate floor will be more meaningful  and perhaps the decorum more along  the lines of what he would hope to see.  In any event, I think television is a  most  important means of  informing  the American people, and I hope that  the Senate will have the good sense to  support the resolution offered by Sen ator Baker and others.  We  are  elected  to  represent  the  people of our State.  I know of no  reason why our service to them should  not be open to the fullest observation  and scrutiny.  The issues with which we are con cerned are the most vital of the day.  On this floor this year we have dis cussed control of nuclear arms,  the  freedom  of  our Central American  neighbors, the protection of finite nat resources,  and  generally  the  rights of all of us to enjoy the bounti ful wealth of this country.  Mr. President, every American has  the right to watch us at work and to  hold us accountable for how we repre sent them. Televising Senate debates  enhances these opportunities.  There are many arguments made or  implied that the quality of debate will  be affected by television; that Sena tors will play to the grandstands and  exploit the exposure for personal gain.  It has been suggested that the image  of  the Senate will  suffer because  people will see how we work.

1469,1205,18,Mr. FORD of Tennessee.," Mr. Speak er, as you know, America's steel indus try has been devastated over the years  by imported steel from countries who  oftentimes subsidize  their  industries,  and who at the same time, impose re strictive import schemes to prevent us  from selling steel in their countries.  On the other hand, nearly 33 per cent of the steel sold in this country in  July was produced overseas. Addition ally,  jobs  in  the steel  industry has  fallen  from  an  average  of  workers between 1975-79  last year-a reduction of 46 percent.  Walter Mondale said in Cleveland,  OH, yesterday that he will cut steel  imports to 17 percent of domestic con sumption for 5 years to give the indus try the opportunity to become more  competitive internationally.  The Reagan administration is toying  with various proposals to cut import  steel  from  percent-it must  reach a decision by September 24.  It is obvious that we, as Members of  Congress,  cannot  stand  back  and  watch the demise of our steel industry.  Nor can we afford  to watch other  countries provide assistance  to their  steel industry in order that they can  453,000  to 243,000  19-21  then sell their steel in our country at a  cheaper price.  Should  the Reagan administration  fail to take adequate action over the  next week, I encourage my colleagues  to support other measures that will  provide much needed assistance to our  steel industry which is so vital to our  national economy.  We can't afford to play politics with  243,000 unemployed workers.  KITTINGER CROSSES THE ATLANTIC.....,BALLOON  RECORD  SET  <Mr. McCOLLUM  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.>  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, yes terday American balloonist Joe Kit tinger of Orlando completed the first  solo balloon crossing of the Atlantic  Ocean in a balloon named the Rosie  O'Grady's Balloon  of  Peace  and  landed this morning in Italy.  My friend and constituent Joe Kit tinger  is no ordinary man. He  is a  much decorated former military pilot  and prisoner of war in the Vietnam  war. In 1960, Joe set a world record for  free fall when he plunged 16.04 miles  before opening his parachute after  jumping  from  a  balloon at 102,800  feet. In July 1982, he set the world's  record for distance  in a  1,000 cubic  feet helium balloon in a flight from  to Quebec covering  miles in 48 hours.  During his Atlantic flight this week  Joe broke both the world class balloon  distance  and  duration  records  and  became the first man to cross the At lantic alone in a balloon.  Joe Kittinger is an American hero.  He follows in the footsteps and tradi tions of great American aviation heros  like Charles Lindbergh and Neil Arm strong. It is this pioneering spirit of  America  and w1111ngness  to  strive  against all odds for individual achieve ment  that  have made  our Nation  great.  Joe Kittinger, we're mighty  proud of you.

",1984
1470,1205,18,Mr. ROEMER.," Mr. Speaker, I be lieve in bank regulation if done fairly  and with the public welfare in mind.  Interestingly, for all of my life, either  while obtaining a degree in economics  or while engaging in small business or  while pursuing legislative goals, I have  believed  in free enterprise or what  practical economists call marketplace  pricing.  I still believe  in the freedom,  the  competition and the efficiency of the  marketplace.  It promotes  individual  liberty and expands economic opportu nity.  The greatest threats to the market place are consumer  ignorance, busi ness greed and monopoly. In order to  protect against these threats, the gov ernment has an occasional, but legiti mate, regulatory role.  Banks, for  instance. Banks are too  important and the potential for abuse  of money and power too great to com pletely deregulate the system. For ex ample, Continental Illinois Bank could  not be allowed to fail for fear of col lapsing the entire banking system.  Thus, I believe in market pricing and  bank regulation.  Shocking as this is to this adminis tration, free enterprise and fair bank  regulation go together or not at all.  0 1240  6012  H.R.

1471,1205,18,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Speaker, it is im portant to address H.R. 6012, but it is  important also to consider it under the  normal rules so it can be debated and  amended.  I am particularly concerned about  one provision of the bill that plainly  requires amendment. That is a provi sion that appears to be aimed at an ap propriate result, but that attempts to  achieve  it in a  totally  inappropriate  way. I am speaking of the provision re quiring  that  sentencing  guidelines  specify sentences that will not result  in prison overcrowding. While over crowding is a serious difficulty, that  approach is the least defensible way to  avoid  it. Any  sentencing guidelines  system should assure that the guide lines are developed with the determi nation of achieving essential public  purposes;  usually,  just punishment,  deterrence, and incapacitation in the  case of  imprisonment. They should  not be developed with a view to filling  available  space with  a  compatible  number of bodies. We might as well  provide  that  the guidelines  specify  sentences that will not result in under  utilization of prisons.  There  is, of course,  a  better ap proach. We should amend the bill to  require those developing the sentenc ing guidelines determine  the  impact  the guidelines will have on the capac ity of the correctional system, proba tion as well as prisons, and then rec ommend to the Congress any increases  in capacity that the affected portion  of the system may require. That kind  of approach would help us  to avoid  prison overcrowding, and would also  ",1984
1472,1218,18,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker. I want to  thank the committee for including sec tion 115 concerning the tariff treat ment of certain types of rope. and I  urge the House to approve this provi sion. along with the rest of the bill.  Section 115 closes a tariff loophole  that the Koreans are using to kill the  U.S. rope industry.  Today,  nearly  identical  pieces of  rope  have  enormous differences  in  tariff treatment. If a piece of rope is  made  from  twisted strips of plastic  which are less than 1 inch in width.  the law classifies it as a textile product  with a tariff of around 15 to 23 per cent. The USTR recognized the U.S.  rope industry was in trouble and nego tiated an MFA quota on imports of  this rope from Korea.  What did  the Koreans do? They  found a loophole in the law that says  that if the plastic strip is more than l inch wide, it is a plastic product and  the tariff is only 6.5 percent. there is  no MFA quota. and the product is also  eligible for GSP from Korea. so comes  in duty-free.  There is no difference whatsoever in  ropes.

Jobs. production  capacity. and utilization are all down.  Section 115 gets rid of the 1 inch dis tinction. It treats these really identical  pieces of rope the same.  This provision passed  the Senate  earlier this year. but was dropped in  the conference on H.R. 4170-the defi cit reduction bill-without prejudice.  Some controversy also arose earlier be cause the importer convinced several  farm groups to say that the bill would  result in higher baler twine prices. We  have shown that this is not true. Thus.  the Grange and the National Farmers  Union which once opposed the bill no  longer oppose it. The domestic indus try has given assurances that the bill  will not result in higher baler twine  prices. About 85 percent of all baler  twine  is made from a natural fiber.  sisal, which  is  imported. The  rest  comes  from  domestic  plastic  rope  makers. which is priced about 20-per cent below  the  imported  rope. The  competition is so heavy among prod ucts. there is no potential for improp er price rises. The market for plastic  baler twine is also limited by the fact- as several farmer groups have noted that cows and other animals can get  sick eating plastic. but can digest sisal!  Again. I thank the committee for its  work on section 115 and urge its ap proval.  It will close an unintended  loophole, return to the status quo of  1981, and save hundreds of jobs in the  U.S. rope industry.e  ",1984

The Secre tary of State should reassess the pur pose and need for existing honorary  consulates and should rescind the ap proval granted for the establishment  of the honorary South African consul ate in Pittsburgh, PA.  The purpose of honorary consulates  is to allow other governments a  less  expensive means of providing certain  kinds of services and promotional op portunities for business and  tourism  than a government is able to provide  through its embassy and official con sulates.

1487,1283,18,Mr. COYNE.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  strong support of House Concurrent  Resolution 42, a bill which expresses  the sense of Congress on the matter of  honorary consulates of the Republic  of South Africa located in the United  States.  The measure has three objectives:  First,  it calls on the Secretary of  State to refuse to approve the opening  of any additional honorary consulates  of South Africa in the United States.  Second, the bill asks the Secretary  of State to reassess the need for exist ing  honorary  consulates  of South  Africa in the United States.  Third, the measure requests that the  State Department's approval of an  honorary consulate of South Africa in  the city of Pittsburgh, PA, be rescind ed.  The South African Government's  systematic repression of blacks, con demned by the civilized nations of the  world, is rejected as well by the silent  majority of  that nation, a majority  silent not by choice but as a result of  political and social discrimination.  Let us consider recent events; 8 out  of 10 so-called coloreds and Asians re fused to take part last month in elec tions for a parliament which excludes  blacks. The protests which accompa nied the elections brought a response  from the South African Government  that was all too expected. South Afri can police attacked boycotters, pro testers,  and  journalists with  clubs,  whips, rubber bullets, and tear gas.  Some who protested a  recent rent  rise  in black areas of South Africa  have paid with their lives. More than  30 people were killed, and hundreds  more injured, in protests last month.  Surely  this  is not a nation which  merits closer diplomatic relations. By  allowing the opening of new honorary  consulates, which often promote closer  business  and  trade  ties with  the  United States, the State Department  would do just that.  I can assure you that the people of  Pittsburgh do not desire closer diplo matic ties with South Africa, nor do  we want an honorary South African  consulate in our city. Passage of this  sense of Congress resolution will put  this House on record in opposition to  the opening of the Pittsburgh honor ary consulate and any similar offices  in other cities. The approval of this  legislation would not affect our gener al  diplomatic  relations with South  Africa. We would continue to conduct  normal  diplomatic  business  the  State Department heeds the sense of  Congress. What would change  is  a  policy which allows the Government  of  South  Africa  to  expand  and  strengthen its political and economic  ties to the United States through the  opening of new honorary consulates in  this country even as it represses the le gitimate aspirations of the majority of  people in its own country.  if  I urge a yes vote on House Concur rent Resolution 42. At  this point,  would like to include in the REcORD a  selection of recent news articles which  describe the current situation in South  Africa:  I  [From the Pittsburgh Press]  UGLY FARcE IN SoUTH AFRicA  The embattled Asian and mixed-race resi dents of South Africa deserve the admira tion of free peoples everywhere. They have  thwarted a drive by their white-supremacist  rulers to put a benign mask on the ugly  system of racial segregation known as apart heid.  Last November Prime Minister Pieter W.  Botha ingeniously had white voters adopt a  new constitution that for the first time ap peared to give political rights to the coun try's 2.8 million ""coloreds"" (persons of white  and black blood) and 800,000 Asians, mostly  of Indian ancestry.  Each group would get a segregated cham ber of Parliament of its own. However, a  third chamber, exclusively white, could veto  laws passed by the other two. And on top of  all three would be a white president, most  likely Botha, with near-dictatorial powers.  The Asians  and  coloreds  saw  through  Botha's con game. It was an attempt  to  make South Africa look quasi-democratic to  a  critical world.  It would separate  them  from the 20 million black majority, which  got nothing, and help 4.5 million whites mo nopolize political power.  Coloreds were to go to the polls first. Last  week it was the Asians' turn. Both resisted  government pressure and overwhelmingly  boycotted Botha's farce. Only about 18 per cent of those eligible voted, discrediting the  process.  South African police reacted with their  usual violence, attacking boycotters, pro testers and  journalists with clubs, whips,  rubber bullets and tear gas. So much for  Botha's ""liberalization.""  When the plan for phony parliaments for  coloreds and Asians was adopted last year,  the U.S. State Department, with its mastery  of doublespe.ak, called it ""a step in the right  direction.""  Now that South Africa's non-whites have  rebuffed the effort to pretty up racial perse cution, what do Foggy Bottom's apologists  for apartheid have to say?  [From the Washington Fost, Aug. 30, 19841  VERDICT ON SoUTH AFRicAN REFoRM  The Verdict  that counts most has now  been pronounced on South Africa's political  reform. True, an earlier verdict had been de livered by the country's ruling white minori ty, which, consulting none of  the other  racial groups and least of all the disenfran chised black majority, last November over whelmingly approved a plan giving a limited  parliamentary voice to Indians and mixed race Coloreds. These two groups have now  weighed in. Since they would presumably be  the chief beneficiaries of what the sponsor ing whites proudly hall as a ""new dispensa tion,"" their verdict is of special importance.  It is, on the whole, devastating. Only 20 per cent of registered Indians voted for the new  parliamentary seats being offered them, and  only 30 percent of registered Coloreds.  Why such a minimal response? The whites  claim there was  intimidation. The charge  would be amusing, given the intimidation  practiced by South Africa's whites-locking  up leaders of the boycott movement on the  eve of elections, for instance-were it not a  ",1984

I insert the text of Gover nor Peabody's speech at this point in  the RECORD for the benefit of all who  have an interest in this historic land mark:  The text follows:  BALL'S BLUFF-A SMALL BATTLE WITH LARGE  CONSEQUENCES  <By Endicott Peabody)  Thank you Judge Hannum. I am compli mented to have been invited to speak on the  occasion of the preservation of Ball's Bluff  Battlefield here in Leesburg, Virginia as a  National Historic Landmark. The gratitude  of this nation is owed to a small group of pa triots who worked in the shadows without  recognition and many without compensa tion to bring this about. They are: Frank  Raflo, Loudoun Country Board of Supervi sors; John Devine, Loudoun County Histori cal Society; Hugh Harmon, Assistant Direc tor of Economic Development; Tom N&lls,  Attorney  for  the Beus Corporation; Ed  Bearss, Chief Historian of the Department  of the Interior; Russ Dickenson, National  Park Service Director; Jerry Rogers, Associ ate Director of Cultur&l Resources-Depart ment  of  the  Interior; Honorable  John  Hannum, U.S. District Judge, whose inspira tion and drive crowned all other efforts to  bring this occasion about today.  We should also be indebted to the Beus  Corporation which donated 61 acres for this  purpose; Cecil Culbertson, 11 acres; and. of  course,  the Veterans  Administration who  donated the origin&l 6 acres of the National  Milltary Cemetery here at Ball's Bluff;  amounting to a tot&l of 78 acres for the Na tion&! Historic Landmark.  Also, we should be indebted to a distin guished group of scholars and authors who,  in recent years, have shed new light on one  of the sm&llest battles with the largest con sequence  in  the Civil War: Dr.  Joseph  Harsh, George Mason University Depart ment of History; Gener&l Joseph Patch,  author of the narrative on Ball's Bluff; Dr.  Edward Bearss. Department of Interior and  Rowena Reed. author of Combined Oper ations in the Civil War.  It Is ironic that we should commemorate back to back-the Normandy  invasion on  June 6 and the Battle of Ball's Bluff today;  perhaps the best and the worst examples of  an amphibious assault on hostlle son by  U.S. troops.

1490,1335,18,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to salute a most remarkable in dividual on the occasion of his 75th  birthday, a man whose  life-long en deavors have given new meaning  to  the word service.  As a civic leader in the Bronx for 45  years, Elias Karmon has devoted a  substantial amount of his time to work  voluntarny with dozens of groups and  organizations  to keep  the Bronx a  good place to live and work. He has  served, for example, on the board of  the Bronx Chamber of Commerce for  30 years and as its president for 4 con secutive years;  as chairman of  the  Bronx Council of the Albert Einstein  College of Medicine; as president of  the Bronx Rotaiy Club; as chairman  of  the executive  committee of  the  Bronx Boys Club; as vice president of  the American Jewish Congress, Bronx  Division; as chairman of the advisory  committee  of  the Bronx Venture  Corp.-a nonprofit local development  corporation; and as chairman of Vaca tions and Community Services for the  Blind.  Even though he shall be honored for  his past accomplishments during his  testimonial dinner on September 20,  Elias Karmon continues to this day to  be one of the most active citizens in  the Bronx. He currently serves not  only on the board of directors of the  Ponce De Leon Federal Savings &  Loan Association, which he cofounded,  but also a host of other civic organiza tions. For example, he continues  to  devote himself to community action in  the Bronx by serving on the boards of  the Bronx House, YMCA, Fordham  Road Area Development Corp., Re gional Aid for Interim Needs, South  Bronx Mental Health Council, Pelham  Parkway Mall  Development  Corp., Bronx Dance Theater, Bronx  Overall Economic Development Corp.,  and Pelham Parkway Jewish Center.  Of course, I am not the first to rec ognize Elias for his tremendous efforts  on behalf of those of us who live and  work in the Bronx. During his 16 years  as a member of the lay advisory board  of  the old Lincoln Hospital, and 9  Local  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  years as its chairman, the board ob tained the commitment for the build ing of the new Lincoln Medical Center.  In appreciation of his contributions,  the  Lincoln  Hospital  Community  Board and  the . administrative staff  dedicated the board conference room  as the ""Elias Karmon Board Confer ence Room."" Last February, the New  York Urban League cited Mr. Karmon,  as past chairman of the Bronx Urban  League Advisory Board, as a ""Charter  Member and Founder of the Bronx  Office  of  the  New  York Urban  League,'' and saluted him for ~ dedi cated service and leadership spanning  35  years. On  the ""Bill Boggs Live  Show"" on WNEW-TV in 1979, here ceived the coveted Jefferson Award for  Public Service.  An individual who devotes as much  concern for his fellow human beings,  dedicated as much effort to improving  his  community,  and  volunteers  as  much of his  life  to others as Elias  Karmon  has  is  a  rare  individual  indeed-an individual to whom those  of us who live and work in the Bronx  are very much indebted. Thank you,  Elias, for everything you have done  and for everything you continue to do  for the Bronx.e  CONGRATULATIONS TO EAGLE  SCOUT BRIAN WALSTROM  HON. ROY DYSON  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  ~da~Se.p~ber1~1984  e ",1984
1491,1335,18,Mr. DYSON.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to take this opportunity to bring  to your  attention  the elevation of  Brian Robert Walstrum of my district  to the rank of Eagle Scout.  The  outstanding  contributions  of  this  country's Eagle Scouts  are  a  source of national pride. Even Ameri cans unfamiliar with the specific re quirements for this honor realize that  to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, a  Boy Scout must demonstrate leader ship,  integrity, and a  dedication  to  high ideals.  Brian, a resident of Stevensville on  Kent Island and a member of Boy  Scout Troop 2576, has proved that he  embodies these qualities. I ask you all  to join me in congratulating him on  this exceptional honor.e  A BILL TO PERMANENTLY AU THORIZE SECTION 1619 OF THE  SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY  AMENDMENTS OF 1980  /  HON. STEVE BARTLETI'  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesda~Se.p~ber1~1984   Mr.  today,  BARTLETI'. Mr.  Speaker,  I  intend  to  introduce a  bill  25951  which would allow disabled persons on  social security supplemental security  income [SSil who want to work the  chance to do so. It would also ensure  that persons on SSI receive the Medic aid benefits to which they are legally  entitled. Specifically, the billFirst, permanently authorizes  the  section 1619 provision of the Social Se curity Disability Amendments of 1980;  Second,  establishes  an  automatic  triggering mechanism to promote par ticipation  in  the section 1619 provi sion;  Third,  authorizes  a General Ac counting Office [GAOl national study  on the effects of section 1619; and  Fourth, requires concurrent notifica tion of eligibility for SSI and Medicaid  benefits.  The  intent of  section 1619  is  to  enable disabled persons to be produc tively employed. A significant number  of  the estimated 2,900,000  disabled  persons currently on SSI who wish to  work do not do so because they fear  loss of their Medicaid benefits. There  are two conditions under which they  can lose their benefits: If they exceed  $300 in monthly earnings, which is the  substantial  gainful  activity  [SGAl  level, or if they work any 9 months out  of 24. Disabled SSI recipients know  that because of their chronic disabil ities they cannot easily obtain private  health  insurance.  Consequently,  rather than lose their Medicaid bene fits, they choose either not to work or  to keep their monthly earnings under  $300.  When section 1619 was passed  in  1980, its purpose was to remedy this  dilemma by allowing disabled SSI re cipients to continue receiving Medicaid  after they pass the SGA level or after  they have worked 9 months out of 24.  Section 1619 is a sound concept. It en courages people who want to work to  do so without fear of losing their Med icaid  insurance.  In  addition,  the  Nation saves money because it does  not pay SSI cash benefits to these per sons who want to be more self-suffi cient by exceeding the SGA level.  Participation in section 1619 needs  to be expanded, however. Currently,  only about 5,000 persons are enrolled  nationwide  out of  the more  than  2,900,000 disabled persons on the SSI  rolls. There are two major reasons for  this lack of participation:  First, lack of awareness of the exist ence of section 1619 by those who are  eligible, and second, the fact that sec tion 1619 is not a permanent program.  My bill corrects both these problems.  It permanently authorizes section 1619  so people will have confidence  that  the program will be maintained and  that, therefore, the benefits of enroll ing are no longer outweighed by the  real risk that the program could be  terminated.

1496,12,23,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  Senate is in morning business.  the  I  is  THE INTELLIGENCE BUDGET  ,1984
1497,12,23,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr. President, in a  few moments the Senate will take up  the Intelligence authorization bill for  the fiscal year 1985. This will provide  the largest budget for an intelligence  community that has ever been made  available by this Congress and which I  think can fairly be judged the largest  ever  to have been provided by any  nation at any point in history.  The public, which  is, of necessity,  kept  somewhat at a  distance  from  these figures-their representatives in  the Congress do have access to them would want  to know that the  large  budgetary  increases  that  followed  from a long period of decline have now  about reached their limit. The outyear  expenditures in this budget-what we  commit ourselves to in terms of what  we begin now and continue to pay for  over some years-obviously, this has to  do with  technological matters-are  fewer  than  they have been  in  the  recent past and they go down more  quickly. To be precise, Mr. President,  in  the early parts of  this period a  fairly considerable amount of techno logical equipment was ordered up. The  first year costs in these matters are  relatively low; the outyear costs rela tively high; then they drop off quite  precipitously.  The point  that  I would wish  to  make-and the Senator from Arizona,  our beloved chairman, Senator GOLD WATER,  who  is  necessarily  absent,  would wish to make, is that this has  been a bipartisan achievement.  The  intelligence  community  is  a  term which is fairly descriptive of the  many organizations that are involved  in gathering and analysis of  intelli gence  data  and  the  dissemination  through  the Government  from  the  President down. The nonclassified por tion of our text gives an explicit list of  the 10 agencies' activities for which  the Intelligence Committee authorizes  the budget. They are the Central In telligence Agency, the Department of  Defense,  the  Defense  Intelligence  Agency, the National Security Agency,  the Department of the Army, the De partment of  the Navy,  the Depart ment of the Air Force, Department of  State, Department of Treasury,  the  Department of Energy,  the Federal  Bureau of Investigation, and the Drug  Enforcement Administration.  Mr. President,  as has been made  clear in several exchanges, not all of  them are of the happiest order,  the  present size of the appropriations and  authorizations  of  this  community  comes about in the aftermath of a con tinuous increase that now takes place  over 8 consecutive fiscal years. Begin ning in fiscal 1978, which was the first  full budget submitted by  the Carter  administration, the programs have in creased in 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982,  1983, 1984, and 1985. This is 8 consecu tive years the intelligence budget has  grown.  Mr. President, the Senator from Ari zona CMr.  GOLDWATER]  would  also  wish it understood that this has been  a bipartisan effort and  that  it has  worked. The experiment-it was that of establishing an intelligence commit tee in each body has succeeded in re storing  the  resources of  the  intelli gence  community, and we  certainly  hope its capacity. This has been a suc cess story.  There has, however, been one failure  in  the  relations of  the  intelligence  community and the committee so far.  This has had to do with the operations  of  the U.S. Government  in Central  America, specifically in Nicaragua.  This failure arose from the decision  of the Director of Central Intelligence  not to consult with our committees,  not to take us into his agency's confi",1984
1498,25,23,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President,  the  conference report on the continuing  resolution <H.J. Res.  648),  includes  some provisions on computer crime  which were not part of the continuing  resolution as passed by either House.  The  conference  report  is  therefore  subject to a point of order, since it  contains material that is outside the  proper scope of the conference. The  objectionable provisions form only a  very small part of the massive meas ure that is before us, and in order to  expedite  the presentation of a  con tinuing resolution to the President, I  am prepared  to withhold my objec tion. But I want the record to reflect  my view that the inclusion of these  computer crime provisions on the con tinuing  resolution  epitomizes  the  drawbacks  of  this  inappropriate  method of enacting permanent legisla tion on highly controversial issues.  I am particularly concerned about  one of the new crimes created by the  computer  crime  legislation we  are  about to send on to the White House.  It makes it a misdemeanor to ""know ingly use     or disclose information  in [any] computer     operated for  or on behalf of the Government of the  United States,"" if the computer is ac cessed without authorization, or if the  scope of authorized access is exceeded.  The sweep of this language, if read  literally, is astonishingly broad. Gov ernment computers contain vast quan tities of information on every imagina ble subject. The use or disclosure of  any of  this  information, no matter  how innocuous, appears to be a crime,  subject only to the limitation that the  defendant obtained  the  information  from a computer without authority or  in excess of his authority.  Senators should note that the lan guage  of  this  section  focuses  on  whether access is authorized, not on  whether the use or disclosure of inf or mation is authorized. Thus, it appears  that  information whose  release  is  mandated by the Freedom of Inf orma tion Act is also covered. This inf orma tion,  to which Congress has deter mined that the public should have an  unfettered right of access, may not,  under the bill before us, be released by  a Government employee whose  au thority to obtain it is in any doubt.  This, at least, is the reading suggested  by the words of the bill.  If this reading is correct, the impact  on the Freedom of Information Act,  and on  the public's right  to know,  could  be  profound. Although  the  FOIA gives courts jurisdiction to de termine whether Government docu ments may or must be released to the  public, anyone who has ever used that  statute knows that its effectiveness de pends  on  voluntary  compliance  by  Government agencies with  its  strictures. Under existing  law, when an  FOIA officer in a Federal agency re ceives  an  information  request,  the  main question that he or she must re solve is whether the document sought  is  subject  to mandatory  release, or  whether one of the discretionary ex emptions provided by the FOIA is ap plicable. If the computer crime provi sion before us becomes law, an addi tional,  and  essentially  irrelevant,  factor will take on controlling signifi cance  if, as will  increasingly be  the  case,  the  information sought is con tained  in a computerized data base.  Even if the FOIA officer determines  that the information sought falls out side any FOIA exemption, and there fore may not be withheld, the question  will then become whether the employ ee asked to release the data has au thority to obtain it. In any close case,  the doubt is sure to be resolved against  the interests of the public, since an in correct assertion of authority could  expose the Government employee to  prosecution and  imprisonment. It is  not hard to imagine what will happen  to the prevailing regime of voluntary  compliance with FOIA, once this addi tional hurdle is placed in the way of  the Public's right to know. Faced with  the prospect of criminal prosecution,  even  for  an  authorized  disclosure,  more and more agency officials will  play it safe, and let the courts decide.  I am sure that this consequence of  the passage of this legislation is unin tended. The authors of the computer  crime bill surely did not set out to  write a blanket secrecy statute rolling  back the Freedom of Information Act;  but, unfortunately, the plain language  of the bill suggests that that is precise ly what is before us today. A fuller leg islative history might have helped to  correct  this problem; but  the route  that this !>ill has traveled has not been  conducive  to  such  explication. The  provision that I have been discussing  formed proposed section 1030(a)(5) of  title 18, in H.R. 5616, the credit card  fraud bill to which the computer crime  legislation was attached in the House  of Representatives. Both the report of  the House  Judiciary Committee on  H.R. 5616, and the debate in the other  body when it was passed last July, give  scant attention to section 1030(a)(5).  I  have mentioned,  neither  the  House nor the Senate included these  provisions  in  the continuing  resolu tion. The  computer  crime  sections  were added by a subcommittee of the  conference committee, literally in the  middle of the night last Thursday, or  the early hours of Friday morning.  The  full conference committee, dis tracted  by  ongoing  disputes  over  wholly unrelated portions of the con tinuing resolution, ratified its subcom mittee's recommendation, and the con ference report has now been approved  by the House. Now here along the line  has there been an opportunity for the  As  Senate to examine the computer crime  bill in enough detail to iron out the  problems that may be caused by the  excessively broad sweep of this subsec tion, to say nothing of other parts of  the bill that could be improved. One  could hardly hope  to  find a better  object lesson in the shortcomings of  legislation by rider.  The problem of computer crime is a  real and growing one. Our challenge is  to fashion an appropriate Federal re sponse.  In my view, H.R. 5616 represented  an important first step in that process,  and its principal authors, Representa tives WILLIAM HUGHES  and HAROLD  SA WYER, deserve credit for getting the  ball rolling. But much more remains  to be done, not only to shape a com prehensive response  to  the problem,  but also to correct the wobbly course  on which this legislation launches us.  The hearings  that Senator LAxALT  plans to hold in the Criminal Law Sub committee early in the next Congress  should provide a good forum for tack ling these important tasks. I plan to  follow  closely  the progress of  this  effort.  ",1984
1499,25,23,Mr. LAXALT.,"  I  understand  that  computer crime sections of the crime  package  included on  the continuing  resolution do not contain a specific ex ception for the activities of legitimate  governmental law enforcement or in telligence agencies. I ask my colleague,  the manager of that section,  if this  was deliberate?  ",1984
1500,25,23,Mr. RUDMAN.," I am glad the Sena tor brought up that subject. I say to  my friend  that a specific exemption  was  left out inadvertently when the  conference agreements reached on the  crime package were reduced to writing.  Any corrective language proposed next  year to correct this error would cer tainly have my support.  However, it is the view of several au thorities that have looked at this issue  that there already exists more than  adequate protection for legitimate law  enforcement and intelligence activities  under existing law, particularly exist ing common law. Nothing in the crime  package  is  intended  in any way  to  limit those existing legal protections.  ",1984
1501,25,23,Mr. LAXALT., I thank my colleague  for that clarification.  HUSH KITS  ,1984
1502,25,23,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr.  President,  I  would appreciate a point of clarifica tion regarding the transportation sec tion  of  the  continuing  resolution.  Under FAA  regulations, carriers are  required to modify their aircraft, for  landing at U.S. airports, with ""hush  kits"" to comply with FAA noise regula tions. These regulations  require  the  acquisition of noise abatement devices,  hush kits, originally expected  to be  available in time to meet the January  1985 deadline .  .  ",1984
1503,38,23,Mr. LEVIN.," I would like to engage  the distinguished chairman of the De fense Appropriations Subcommittee in  a brief colloquy about a program both  of us have  supported strongly  this  year and in the past-the Submarine  <Blue-Green) Laser Communications  Program.  The blue-green laser system has the  great potential  to  be  a  survivable,  high-performance, high-data-rate com munications system for our strategic  ballistic missile and attack submarines.  The Armed Services Committee, on  which I serve, has authorized addition al  funds-at my urging-for several  years to accelerate this program. The  chairman's Defense  Appropriations  Subcommittee  has  provided  similar  funding support.  This year, our committee and  its  House counterpart authorized an addi tional $12.5 million for this program $10 million more  than  the original  budget request  for  the Defense Ad vanced  Research  Project  Agency  CD ARP A] and $2.5 million more for  the Navy.  The Defense appropriations confer ees on the continuing resolution were  able to provide-due to overall funding  constraints-$7 .5 million to accelerate  the Submarine Laser Communication  Program.  Would  the distinguished chairman  agree  that the conferees' action did  not indicate any lack of support for  this important research program and  that  there was no prejudice  toward  the  program  connected with  the  action?  ",1984
1504,38,23,Mr. STEVENS., I would agree. The  conferees recognize the great potential  of  this  submarine  communications  system. Overall  funding  constraints  necessitated our action  to fund $7 .2  million more for the blue-green laser  system in fiscal year 1985  instead of  the $12.5 million more authorized.  ,1984
1505,38,23,Mr. LEVIN.," I believe the funds have  been well  spent and  that  the pro gram's potential will support a full go ahead decision.  I am concerned about the additional  $5 million authorized for DARPA for  this  program  in  fiscal  year  1985.  Would  the  chairman  agree  that,  should additional funds become avail able  during  fiscal  year  1985  from  within the overall funds appropriated  for defense, he would be receptive to  receiving  a  reprogramming  request  from DOD for the remaining $5 mil lion authorized to actually be appro priated to accelerate the Blue Green  Laser  Submarine  Communications  Program?

1506,38,23,Mr. STEVENS.," I share the Senator's  interest in this program, and I would  be receptive to a reprogramming pro posal.  ",1984
1507,38,23,Mr. LEVIN., I thank the chairman.  ,1984
1508,38,23,Mr. WALLOP.," Mr. President, the ac tions by the conference committee and  the Congress  in  the passage of  the  continuing resolution cause me great  concern. I have spoken elsewhere on  the gravity of the 5-month delay and  potential refusal of aid to the rebels  fighting  for  freedom  in Nicaragua.  The additional actions of the confer ence committee  in delaying deploy ment of MX and in reducing further  the funds authorized for the strategic  defense  initiative  demonstrate  that  the Congress is withholding from this  country the ability to def end itself. It  appears that Congress can't recognize  the nature of the threats we face in  the world  today. Unfortunately,  the  results of failure to face these threats  will be more difficult to deal with in  future years.  This general problem is demonstrat ed  in  the actions of the conference  committee in dealing with deployment  of MX  in Wyoming and Nebraska.  Over the past 2 years, the Air Force,  State and local government staff, offi cials, and citizens have been involved  in concentrated study of the impacts  associated with the deployment of MX  in southeastern Wyoming and western  Nebraska. These studies revealed that  the major impacts are associated with  the construction of major support fa cilities on F.E. Warren Air Force Base  in Cheyenne. These support facilities  are needed irrespective of whether 10  or 100 missiles are deployed. The stud ies also revealed that construction of  the community capital improvements  must begin immediately if the schools  and water is to be available when peak  construction impacts occur. The con ference deferred the $5.9 million fund ing for these facilities while giving ap proval to nearly $100 million associat ed with deployment of the first MX  missiles. As  the citizens of Wyoming  have learned in dealing with numerous  energy projects  in  the  last decade,  such neglect of community support fa cilities  is extremely unwise and will  only work to make deployment activi ties more difficult. I am hopeful that  the Appropriations Committees will  make  timely approval of reprogram ming requests for the impact mitiga tion funds a high priority.  At this same time, Mr. President, I  feel  I also must express my dismay  and disappointment that funding for  some very  long, and overdue water  projects was also stripped from  this  continuing resolution. It is most unf or tunate that authorized projects, such  as the Buffalo Bill Dam, in my State  of Wyoming were  thrown out along  with other water projects that had not  gone  through  the authorization and  appropriation  process  in  both  the  House and the Senate.  Modification for Buffalo Bill was ini tially authorized at $106,700,000 in Oc tober 1982. In 1983, the Department of  the Interior and the State of Wyoming  agreed  on  a  cost-sharing  proposal,  whereby the State of Wyoming would  pay more than 40 percent of the cap ital cost of  the project. Since  that  time, several attempts to appropriate  the actual  funds have been under mined, even though Wyoming has al ready come up with over $45 million to  cover its share of the project. It is my  sincere hope  that  this much-needed  water project will be funded shortly  after the 99th Congress convenes  in  January.  CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY AND THE CONTINUING  RESOLUTION  ",1984
1509,38,23,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President,  I  com mend  the conferees  for  their hard  work and diligence in resolving differ ences over the many difficult issues in volved in the continuing resolution for  fiscal year 1985.  I note in particular that the continu ing resolution contains a compromise  agreement on the Synthetic Fuels Cor poration. This agreement represents a  consensus in the Congress supporting  the commercial development of syn thetic fuels from the Nation's vast re serves of coal and oil shale. The ad ministration has indicated its support  for this compromise, and I hope that  the  administration will  act  expedi tiously to fill the remaining positions  on the SFC Board of Directors. It is  time to get the SFC back to business.  As an integral part of the SFC com promise, the continuing resolution in cludes $750 million to support clean  coal technology demonstration activi ties. This program will play an impor tant role in accelerating the develop ment of advanced technologies which  will promote the efficient, economical,  and environmentally acceptable use of  coal. The program is based on the Na tional Coal Science, Technology, and  ",1984
1510,51,23,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, as we  move toward adjournment of the 98th  Congress,  I am struck by the sharp  contrast between the Senate's laggard ly performance of the last few days  and  the brilliant  leadership Senator  How ARD BAKER has provided the last 4  years. There can be no more compel ling evidence of the need for reform of  the Senate than our failure  to com plete action on appropriations bills in  spite of How ARD BAKER'S best efforts.  Everyone knows that the role of ma jority leader is a difficult one and in  recent years it has become nearly im possible. Yet Senator BAKER has time  and again risen to the challenges of  partisan politics and procedural ma neuvers to advance the public interest.  In this role Senator BAKER has demon strated the  leadership qualities  that  won him the confidence of Tennessee  voters and made him a most effective  spokesman for their concerns. He has  been considerate of differing points of  view and the rights of everyone to be  heard. He has been courageous in ad dressing issues honestly and generous  in victory as well as def eat. He has  been a Senator of impeccable integri ty, a  leader of unparalleled fairness  and above all, a man of his word.  We will miss Senator BAKER'S pres ence when we return for the 99th Con gress-but when we  do  return and  when we take up the issues of Senate  reform, I hope we will do so with the  same ceaseless determination and com mitment  to  justice  that How ARD  BAKER has shown. If we do, I am confi dent that we can restore confidence in  the Senate and make it worthy of Sen ator BAKER's fine example.  On behalf of Annie and myself,  I  want to extend to HOWARD and Joy  our gratitude for their friendship and  best wishes for the future.  SENATOR TSONGAS  ",1984
1511,51,23,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, we are  all familiar with stories about elected  officials who  stayed  in office  long  after their vision and  judgment had  left them. But it is rare and regretta ble when a leader as young and talent ed as Senator PA UL TsoNGAS chooses to  retire from public title. Sadly this is  the case in PAUL'S decision not to seek  reelection to the Senate.  Although PAUL has served for only  one  term  his  accomplishments  are  wide-ranging and profound. He has  been a leader in the struggle to def end  human rights, he has helped advance  the prospects of strong and effective  arms control, and he has successfully  challenged the traditional thinking of  the Democratic Party.  In  these en deavors he has infused major policy  debates with the idealism, intelligence,  compassion and common sense  that  distinguishes his career. Not only has  Senator TsoNGAS made  noteworthy  contributions in each of these areas,  but he has shaped an agenda for the  future as well.  The  legacy of PAUL's work  in the  Senate will continue to shape our con sideration  of  foreign  and  domestic  policy issues and will serve as an inspi ration to young people considering the  challenges of public service.  I want to thank PAUL  for his out standing service in the Senate, express  my appreciation for his friendship and  advice and extend my best wishes to  him and his family for a bright and  prosperous future.  RETIREMENT OF SENATOR  JENNINGS RANDOLPH  ",1984
1512,51,23,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, through out the 24 years I have served in this  body, it has been both a personal privi lege and honor to work with the senior  Senator from West Virginia [Mr. RAN DOLPH]. His retirement at the end of  this session will mark the conclusion  of 40 years of service in both the U.S.  House of Representatives and the U.S.  Senate.  I have come to know JENNINGS RAN DOLPH best through his work on the  Senate Labor and Human Resources  Committee where we have served to gether. He  is  the senior member of  that committee. In addition, he served  as chairman of the Senate Subcommit tee on the Handicapped from the day  it was created in 1972 and is now its  ranking minority member.  Senator RANDOLPH'S achievements in  the area of increased services and edu cation for the handicapped are legend ary. He was  the original author of  Public Law 94-142, the Education of  the Handicapped Act, which  today  provides special education and related  services to over 4 million handicapped  children. He was  the author of  the  Randolph-Sheppard Act, which estab lished the nationwide system of vend ing stations in public buildings. That  act  now  provides  employment  for  thousands of blind persons  through out our country. Further, he was the  author of both  the Developmental  Disabilities Act and the Vocational Re habilitation Act.  I_  ",1984

1524,77,23,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  question is on agreeing to the motion.  The motion was agreed to.  ,1984
1525,77,23,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  this will be the last authorization that  Senator GOLDWATER and I will have  brought to the floor in behalf of the  committee. I regret that he is neces sarily absent.  I should like to record that this is  the largest authorization bill  in  the  history of the intelligence community  and of our committees.  I think the public is entitled to know  the sustained increase in the budgets  of the intelligence community, which  began in fiscal year 1979 and in the  budgets proposed  in 1978, has now  about reached the limit of our expec tations, and  the out-year growth of  these programs associated with tech nological developments is going to be  limited.  We  feel  strongly  that  the  intelli gence oversight committee system  is  working and has worked. I spoke this  morning of one failure in that system,  when the community did not consult  with the committees before going for ward with an operation  in Central  America which many  thought to be  beyond the limits of  legality and of  prudence.  In the aftermath of that event, we  have developed new relations with re spect to consulation. But I wish it un derstood  that  between  the  time  I  spoke this morning and this hour in  the early afternoon, the U.S. Senate,  by a vote of 78 to 11, has agreed to a  continuing resolution which, in effect  puts an end to the President's options  in  Central  America-very  much  against his wishes,  and he may be  right in that regard.  However,  it should be understood  that when only 11 Members of  the  Senate would oppose such a measure and of those 11, I do not think more  than 5 would have done so on  this  basis-there has been a failure of func tioning in the executive branch; and if  the President or  the Secretary  of  State or the National Security Advisor  wishes to look to see what went wrong,  they need  to  look  to  their own ar rangements. What went wrong was  that the relationship of trust between  the community and Congress was not  observed-the only such breach I am  aware of in 8 years in this committee and it has had consequences.  I  do  not  speak  to  the  question  whether the policies in Nicaragua are  right or wrong. I am just saying that  the people who serve  the President  have served him very poorly if by their  conduct they have made it impossible  for him to pursue those policies as he  hoped to do. This has happened now,  and perhaps we can learn from it. If  we do not, I suppose it will happen  again.  Mr. President, before closing, while  some Members are in the Chamber, let  me observe that this measure, which is  being passed on  the unanimous-con sent calendar, is one of the largest and  most  important pieces of  legislation  Congress will deal with this year. Mat ters of the utmost importance to the  national security are involved here.  We come with a unanimous Senate.  We have worked in a bipartisan mode  to bring this matter here.  Mr. President,  in quick  summary,  this measure is being adopted on the  unanimous-consent calendar, and that  reflects not only the importance of the  measure, but also the bipartisan sup port for it. On its own, were it not for  the nature of the subject matter, this  could occasion a week's debate in the  Senate. It involves issues of the very  utmost importance to the national se curity and to the security of the world.  These have been resolved in an ex emplary manner by our budget sub committee  headed  by  the  distin guished Senator from Wyoming [Mr.  WALLOP] and the equally distinguished  Senator  from Hawaii  [Mr.  INOUYE],  who have served so diligently  these  last 4  years  as  the  subcommittee's  chairman and vice chairman  respec tively.  That we bring this to the Chamber  in a unanimous manner, I  think re flects not only on them, but on the  singularly capable staff. And they will  rarely hear their names at all in the  Chamber, so let me take a moment of  the Senate's time  to read them and  record their merit.  Mr. Keith Hall, our budget officer,  has handled a  task of extraordinary  complexity. Ten different  organiza tions are  involved  in  this, and  the  issues  involved are  the highest and  most technical.  Mr. Robert Simmons, our staff direc tor,  has  managed  the  operation  throughout.  Mr. Gary Chase, our chief counsel,  has been a fount of continued support  and judgment in these matters.  Mr. Daniel Finn, an accomplished at torney, has been the designee of Sena tor INOUYE on the budget committee,  and Dr. Angelo Code villa has been the  designee of Senator WALLOP, who have  worked in silent labor for 11 months  on this enterprise.  Finally, Mr. Peter Sullivan, the mi nority staff director and counsel, has  been a source of good cheer and good  counsel throughout.  Mr.  President,  on  behalf  of  the  members of the committee, I wish to  express our gratitude to them and all  of their colleagues on the committee's  dedicated  professional  and  support  staff.  As I said earlier, this will be my last  opportunity  to  thank  them as vice  chairman. If Senator GOLDWATER were  able to be present, he would do  the  same. I do so on his behalf.  So, Mr. President,  to  these duties,  adieu.  ",1984

The  conferees concur in those colloquies,  which are set forth below:  ",1984
1564,103,23,Mr. BLILEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen tleman for yielding.  I wonder if I might engage the chairman  of the subcommittee in a colloquy.  ",1984
1565,103,23,Mr. WIRTH., Yes.  ,1984
1566,103,23,Mr. BLILEY.," The Federal set-aside of chan nels for commercial use under section 612 is  triggered by the number of ""activated chan nels"" on the cable system. Does that mean  the system's total channel capacity?  ",1984
1567,103,23,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman  will yield, ""activated channels"" means only  the number of channels that subscribers ac tually are receiving. Although this would in clude any so-called dark channels which  subscribers  receive  but which  currently  carry no programming, it would not equate  to  the  total  channel  capacity  of  the  system-the maximum number of channels  that the system could carry-unless the op erator actually had the equipment in place  at the headend of the system to deliver that  maximum number of channels.  ",1984
1568,103,23,Mr. BULEY.," In determining whether the  price for commercial use of channels under  section 612 is reasonable, courts may look to  the price arrangements for comparable serv ices. Yet if such services are offered by the  operator, typically the operator will pay a  programmer for them. Is it the committee's  intent  that a commercial user, or  lessee,  may require the cable operator to pay him a  comparable price for his programming?  ",1984
1569,103,23,Mr. WIRTH.," The term ""price"" is intended  to encompass any commercial arrangement  consistent with the section. For example,  such arrangements might  include fee per  channel, fees per subscriber, profit sharing,  or any combination of these arrangements.  The  channel  lessee  cannot,  however,  demand that, rather than the lessee paying  the cable operator for access to the cable  system,  the cable operator must pay  the  lessee who uses an access channel. The fact  that the cable operator may pay for pro gramming made  available  over  channels  other than leased access channels has no  relevance to the arrangements that may be  established for the use of channel capacity  designated pursuant to this section.  ",1984
1570,103,23,Mr. BLILEY.," I understand that cable opera tors have an obligation not to fill their com mercial access channels in order  to avoid  bona fide access use. Would it be accurate to  say, however, that cable operators may only  enter into leased access arrangements where  the operator is opposed to granting the pro grammer access to the cable system?  Mr. WrRTH. No. There does not need to be  a ""hostile"" or ""adversarial"" relationship be tween the operator and the programmer for  a grant of access to an unaffiliated program mer to be a legitimate use of channel capac ity designated pursuant to this section.  ",1984
1571,103,23,Mr. BLILEY.,"  Some have  construed  the  committee report's explanation of section  612 to suggest that the absence of any com mercial users on a system is  in itself evi dence that the operator's rates, terms, and  conditions are unreasonable. Is that inter pretation correct?  Mr. WIRTH, Section 612 allows cable oper tors to establish price, terms, and conditions  which at least assure that leased access use  will not adversely affect an operator's eco nomic position.  Indeed, price,  terms, and  conditions are presumed  to be reasonable  absent clear and convincing evidence to the  contrary. In view of the flexibility that this  section grants an operator to establish rates,  terms, and conditions, an operator cannot  be found to have acted in bad faith or to  have established unreasonable rates simply  because parties seeking access choose not to  meet the offered rate.  ",1984
1572,103,23,Mr. BLILEY., The committee package of  amendments includes an amendment to sec tion 635 relating to equal employment op portunity. What is the purpose and intent  of the provision contained in the commit tee's package of amendments?  ,1984
1573,103,23,Mr. WIRTH.," The provision the gentleman  refers to is intended to clarify the commit tee's intent under section 635. The provision  indicates that the failure of a cable operator  to obtain certification under subsection (e)  does not itself constitute a violation of the  EEO provisions of H.R. 4103. Moreover, I  wish to make clear the legislation's intent  that the failure to employ members of mi nority groups and/or women at the pre scribed parity levels does not in and of itself  constitute a violation of this title.

1576,116,23,Mr. DOLE.," There will be a  lot of  amendments I assume filed. We will  have to determine the priorities. If the  priority is to load up the first bill that  comes up with everyone's amendment,  that is  the decision  the Senate will  have to make. I hope we might limit it  to the amendments that are on the  debt ceiling, the Tsongas amendment  and imputed interest compromise. But  obviously other Senators have a per fect right to offer additional amend ments. I will not indicate they cannot  be offered. I am not certain they will  pass. I understand there are a number  of Senators who would  like  to offer  amendments.  I think we may have taken care of  one matter that has been raised by the  Senator from Arkansas,  the Senator  from Pennsylvania, and a number of  other Members who expressed to me  their concern about an  impact of a  Revenue Ruling, 84-132, on the viabili ty of athletic scholarship programs. I  share  these concerns and have dis cussed the issue with the acting assist ant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax  Policy, Mr. Pearlman. He has agreed  that  the Treasury would withdraw  Revenue Ruling 84-132  in order  to  provide an opportunity for an adminis trative hearing. I understand Treasury  would plan to hold this hearing within  90 days and this should allow suf fi cient time for a full public discussion  of the issues concerned.  I have been advised by the Senator  from Arkansas that is certainly a satis factory resolution of that problem. I  have also been advised by the Senator  from Pennsylvania that it is a satisfac tory resolution to that problem.  ",1984
1577,116,23,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President,  if  the  Senator will yield, I want to thank the  Senator from Kansas for having ad dressed a very serious problem where I  think  the  Internal Revenue Service  overreacted.  I  think everybody who  has a major university or college  in  their State, whose alumni and others  would have been affected by the Inter nal Revenue ruling had it gone imme diately  into effect, as was proposed,  should be very grateful to the Senator  from Kansas, as I am.

What I am going  to propose now,  and I have advised the minority leader  and other Senators so no one will be  surprised, is I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate temporarily lay aside  the pending resolution and  turn  in stead  to H.R. 5361,  the group  legal  services bill, which is at the desk.

In addition, an organiza tion created exclusively to form a part  of a qualified group legal services plan  may be exempt from income tax.

The other require ments  that a  qualified group  legal  services plan must meet under present  will continue to apply. In addition, the  bill adds  information and return re porting  requirements  on  employers  maintaining a  qualified group  legal  services plan.  REASONS FOR EXTENSION  When the group legal services plan  tax exclusion was originally enacted, it  was only  for a  temporary period so  Congress would have an opportunity  to evaluate the tax exclusion. The ab sence of any information reporting re quirements during this time has made  it difficult for Congress to obtain in formation concerning the operation of  these plans. The 1 year extension of  the tax exclusion with the added in formation  and  return  reporting  re quirements will provide  the Internal  Revenue Service, Treasury, and Con gress with sufficient data to evaluate  the effectiveness of the tax exclusion  and its effect on the FICA and FUTA  wage base. Hopefully,  this data will  provide Congress with an opportunity  to conduct a comprehensive examina tion of this tax exclusion along with  other tax exclusions.  There are many employers who have  relied on an extension of the current  tax exclusion.

1591,129,23,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, this  amendment has been passed by  the  House in 1982 as H.R. 4577 and was re ported favorably by the Finance Com mittee that year.  The amendment would apply  the  1982 changes with respect to stock op tions  to  a  transaction occurring  in  1973. The  intended beneficiaries are  members of the Franzia family who  became  embroiled  in an unfriendly  takeover of the family's wine business.  As a result, stock options were exer cised, ultimately  to  the  loss of  the  family. At that time, options were tax able at a value considerably greater  than the realized value of the stock.  Therefore, the Franzias paid taxes on  paper  gains. The Senate  and  the  House eventually reversed this absurd  rule, but left the Franzias grievance  unredressed. My amendment offers us  an opportunity to do equity and I ask  approval of the amendment.  ",1984

The amendment is as follows:  The Internal Revenue Service is currently  considering issuing regulations that would  reduce mortgage interest tax deductions by  military personnel who own  their homes  and receive fringe allowances; and  Such  regulations would be contrary  to  previous IRS rulings that expressly allowed  such deductions URS Rulings 62-213m 80173>; and  Such proposed regulations breach pay and  benefit commitments made at the time of  enlistment; and  Such proposed regulations would under mine efforts to permanently establish all volunteer armed forces; and  Such proposed regulations would deter ef forts  to bolster armed service recruitment  and retention of highly qualified military  personnel; and  The proposed regulations would increase  budget deficits because projected revenue  increases would be more  than offset by  higher military payroll costs;  Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate  that no disallowance of traditional deduc tions  for  homeowner  expense  be made  against military homeowners without  the  consent of the Department of Defense and  before  the 99th Congress  statutorily  re solves the issue.  ",1984
1621,129,23,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  this amendment simply expresses the  sense of the Senate that the Internal  Revenue Service not go forward with  rumored plans  to prescribe  regula tions, the effect of which would be to  disallow interest deductions for service  personnel.  There is a  line of thought in some  quarters  that  the historic deduction  should be disallowed. In fact, that is a  subject which  the Senate Finance  Committee would want to take a look  at because it has been part of the tax  practice for many, many years.  The truth of the matter is that if  this were to happen during the inter im while Congress was out of session,  it would really create a chaotic situa tion. Frankly, I  think there  is  little  real chance  that the IRS would be  headstrong enough to go ahead and  u;;sue such regulations.

1625,155,23,Mr. LEAHY.," Madam President,  I  have spoken at different times about  different people on the floor of the  Senate, and while I know I may em barrass  the  distinguished majority  leader, I would like to take a couple of  moments to speak about him.  I have known of the career certainly  of the distinguished majority  leader  prior to my own service in the Senate.  I first saw him as a member of an au dience, as then a prosecutor watching  part of the Watergate hearings. I first  met the distinguished senior Senator  from Tennessee  in  the Lake of the  Ozarks in Missouri.  I assume that again because I was  sort of a starry-eyed prosecutor meet ing this famous person for  the first  time that he would not remember, but  I find that he does indeed remember  that meeting.  The National District Attorneys As sociation was meeting at the Lake of  the Ozarks. He was asked to come out  to speak. We originally had  invited  President Gerald Ford, who was going  to speak. Shortly before that meeting  the Vice President suddenly became  the President, and we said we wanted  someone at least of that stature. Presi dent Ford said, ""I will send you some one far better than the Vice President;  I will send you HOWARD BAKER.""  And Senator BAKER  came  to  the  Lake of the Ozarks. We met at that  time because I had some involvement  with the events there.  I  told Senator BAKER at that time  that he was one of my heroes in Wash ington. I also said in a letter I sent to  him shortly after he announced he  was going to retire from the Senate  that I came to the Senate with only a  handful of heroes here and not all are  still in that same handful. One who  was a hero to me when I came to the  Senate in January 1975 was HOWARD  BAKER; one who remains a hero to me  today is HOWARD BAKER.  I know of no person who epitomizes  more of what I  think a U.S. Senator  should be, the ability to stand strongly  for his principles, stand strongly for  his party but also at the same time to  make sure that the U.S. Senate works  as the conscience of the Nation. We  should  be  the  conscience  of  the  Nation. We were  intended to be the  conscience of the Nation and periodi cally we are. But I think many of the  times we  show ourselves  as  a  con science  of  the Nation  is  because  HOWARD BAKER has made it possible  for us to do so.  I have seen him put aside his own  personal political  fortunes  time and  time  again  to make  sure  that  the  Senate does what is right and that the  Senate allows those varying voices to  be heard, to allow voices that may well  disagree with him to be heard but to  make sure that all sides, conservative,  liberal, Republican,  and Democratic  are heard and  that ultimately  the  Senate can vote and hopefully occa sionally itself as the conscience of the  Nation.  Mr. President, the Senate will be di minished by the loss of How ARD BAKER  but at the same time the Senate has  been  improved and certainly will be  improved for all time by his service as  majority leader.  Each of us, again Republican and  Democrat, who have had a chance to  serve with him have been enhanced by  that  service  and  improved by  that  service. I for one am gratified that I  had a chance to serve with a man who  was a hero to me before I came to the  U.S. Senate, remained a hero to me  while I was here, and always will be.  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BAKER  ",1984
1626,155,23,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Madam Presi dent, I, too, would like to rise in the  closing hours  to salute the majority  leader.  I have had  the privilege of  working with him during his  last 4  years in that capacity.  It is only fair to say that there has  been more than one occasion when he  would have had the right to become  impatient or  to become  irritable or  irascible  when  I  or  some  other  Member of this body was attempting  to maintain his or her position. But  with no exception, I have never seen  the majority leader to be unfair or in dicate his unwillingness  to  listen  to  the other side. He has always tried to  be even-handed, and he has been level headed.  I think it is fair to say that there are  99 Members of this body, Republican  and Democrat alike, who have total re spect for the majority leader.  I  for one have no  reservation  in  saying that I am indeed sorry to see  him leave. I feel that he has provided  a  tempering hand,  a  leveling hand,  many  times, when  the  issues might  have become more bitter or more acri monious, and he has always attempted  to calm the waters and see to it that  each and every one of us has had his  or her say.  He has been a  true statesman, he  has been a gentleman in every sense of  the word, and I believe he has been a  very excellent leader of this body.  I might say parenthetically that I  had occasion to say that publicly just  a few hours ago when one of the na tional networks inquired.  I  am sorry  to see Senator BAKER  retire  from  this  body. He will  be  missed. He will leave big shoes to be  filled. I am one who puts myself in the  position of being one of his admirers,  and one who respects him greatly.  I join your other colleagues in wish ing you well in whatever your endeav ors.  CONGRESSIONAL  RESEARCH  SERVICE  REPORT  ENTITLED  U.S./SOVIET  STRATEGIC  NU CLEAR  FORCES:  POTENTIAL  TRENDS WITH OR WITHOUT  SALT  ",1984
1627,155,23,Mr. CHAFEE.," Madam President, the  Congressional Research Service has  recently prepared a report on one of  the most important issues we will face  in the coming year. This report is enti tled  ""U .S./Soviet Strategic Nuclear  Forces: Potential Trends with or with out SALT.""  This report outlines the possible sce narios which could develop over the  next decade in the strategic arsenals  of  the  two  powers  depending  on  whether  the constraints on nuclear  forces imposed by the Strategic Arms  Limitation Treaties remain in force. It  develops four alternate cases, with dif ferent assumptions about the levels of  resources devoted by the two sides to  their strategic nuclear forces, to illus trate the range of possible force struc tures which could be developed.  I believe this report arrives at an op portune  time. At some point during  the coming year the United States and  the Soviet Union must decide whether  to continue the policy of not undercut ting the existing arms agreements be tween  the  two  sides. Alternatively,  either  of  the  two  countries  could  decide to break out of the agreements.  This  report helps  to  illuminate  the  consequences of such decisions.  ",1984
1628,168,23,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The  question is on agreeing to the amend ment.  The  amendment  agreed to.  ,1984
1629,168,23,Mr. DOLE.," Madam President, H.R.  5386 would establish the routine home  care payment rate at $153.17 per day  for services furnished during the 12month period beginning October 1,  1984.  In addition, the Secretary would be  required to review, not less than annu ally, and, as appropriate, adjust the  7121)  <No.  was  payment rate for routine home care  and for other services included in hos pice care based on the costs that are  reasonable and related to the costs of  furnishing such care and services. The  Secretary would be required to report  to the Congress October 1 of each year  on such review and on the adequacy of  the rates in ensuring particular pation  by an adequate number of hospice pro grams.  The provisions of the bill are eff ec tive October 1, 1984. The Congression al Budget Office has estimated that  the bill will result in additional health  insurance trust fund expenditures of  no more than $1 million in fiscal year  1985.  Madam President, the hospice bene fit under medicare became effective  November 1, 1983. Since then only 119  hospice  programs  nationwide  have  been certified and approved as medi care hospice providers. That is not to  say that some elements of hospice care  are not available to medicare benefici aries. But it is a clear indication that  existing hospices are not interested in  seeking certification as medicare pro viders.  As you may know, based on legisla tion I introduced in 1981 <S. 1958), the  Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility  Act of 1982 CTEFRA] was used  to  create  the hospice care benefit  for  medicare beneficiaries.  Enactment of the hospice provision  was possible because many believe, as I  do, that it is less costly to care for a  patient at home, foregoing expensive  hospital treatment. But more  impor tantly, hospice care is more humani tarian. Rather than being in an insti tution alone much of the time, hospice  care will allow an individual to remain  at home, surrounded by  family and  friends.  We had purposely delayed  imple mentation of the hospice benefit until  November  of  that year,  1983. The  delay was intended to allow the admin istration an opportunity to reflect the  results of a number of hospice demon strations  in  its proposed regulations.  Today we find that we are still facing  problems with  implementation. As  I  have said there are only 119 hospices  certified under the program. Clearly  this is not enough if we are ready to  make  this benefit available  to those  medicare beneficiaries who need  it.  Something would appear to be amiss  and I, like others, am anxious to cor rect it.  Madam President, congressional sup port for hospice has not waned.  In  fact, as recently as September 12, 1984  the Congress passed a resolution desig nating November as ""National Hospice  Month,""  to  recognize  the  contribu tions made by those involved in pro viding hospice  services and  the ad vancement of the movement itself. Be cause of this continuing commitment  to  the program, we are particularly  concerned with what appears to be a  very hesitant response from the hos pice industry.  We knew when the benefit was first  enacted that changes might be neces sary. The amendment which was  in cluded in the 1984 Deficit Reduction  Act, providing some relief to the rural  hospices, is an example of this philoso phy. Some  additional  changes may  still be necessary.  It is my understanding that the most  frequently mentioned area of concern  is the payment level for home care. As  many of you know, the Department of  Health  and Human Services  estab lished a prospective payment system  for hospice care based on  the very  little data  then  available. Payment  rates of $46.25 for routine home care,  $358.67  for  continuous  home  care,  $55.33  for  inpatient respite care and  $271  for general inpatient care were  established for each day a patient was  in the hospice program.  Because  the benefit  sunsets  in  2  years, we are anxious to learn as much  as we can during this period of time. It  is only  in  this fashion  that we can  hope to truly evaluate the success of  the program in meeting the needs of  those who choose the hospice option.  There has been a great deal of debate  over the appropriateness of the home  care rate. Much of the controversy is  related to what the average length of  stay will be for patients and for under  the new benefit. The hospice industry  believes the length of stay will prove  to be substantially shorter than was  experienced under the demonstration  program, the experience upon which  the rate was based. Should this prove  to be  the case,  then  the final pub lished rate would likely be insufficient.  Because we have very limited infor mation upon which this decision can  be based, the Senator from Kansas be lieves an  increase,  to  the originally  published rate, is appropriate at this  time. The Secretary will have ample  opportunity to review additional, more  relevant data, than the demonstration  project, in the months ahead should  changes be necessary next October.  Madam President, I am as anxious as  I am sure we all are to see this benefit  made available. I am just as anxious to  make sure that every effort is made to  have  as many hospice programs as  possible participate during the 3-year  term of present benefit. I would hope  our approval of  this bill spurs  that  participation, for as you know the suc cesses and the problems experienced  by hospices during  this  trial period  will be critically important when we  consider whether or not to make the  benefit a permanent part of medicare.

1630,168,23,Mr. ROTH.," Madam President, I rise  to support this vital hospice bill. This  bill  increases  the routine home care  rate for medicare reimbursement from  $46.25  to $53.17 a day. We all hope  ",1984
1631,181,23,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, it  gives me great pleasure to rise in sup port of the conference report to H.R.  6027, the Local Government Antitrust  Act.  This  legislation  brings much needed order and certainty to our Fed eral antitrust laws as  they apply  to  local governments. Needless  to  say,  local  governments  throughout  the  country have lived in the shadow of  the Supreme Court's 1982 Boulder de cision, and it is time that the Congress  answers at least one major question  that Boulder  raised: Whether both  local governments and nongovernmen tal parties acting at the direction of  local governments, should be liable for  treble damages.  Mr. President, this legislation makes  the determination that under no cir cumstances can local governments be  sued for damages; as long as nongov ernmental parties engage in ""official  action directed by a local government,  or official or employee thereof acting  in  an  official  capacity,""  damages  cannot be assessed against  them as  well. Injunctive relief under section 16  of the Clayton Act, however, can still  be obtained against both local govern ments and nongovernmental parties.  Mr. President, this legislation strikes  an appropriate balance. While taxpay ers will not have to pay treble damage  awards,  injunctive relief will still be  available to halt and prevent antitrust  violations.  Mr. President, I want to thank my  colleagues for their support and assist ance on H.R. 6027. Many Senators and  members  of  their  staffs  have  ex pressed great interest in this legisla tion. The Committee on the Judiciary  worked diligently on this bill. I would  particularly like to thank the Senate  conferees,  the distinguished Senator  from Utah [Mr. HATCH] and the distin guished Senator from Ohio [Mr. METZ ENBAUM]  for  their exceptional work  and cooperation.  I also wish to express my apprecia tion to the junior Senator from New  Hampshire [Mr. RUDMAN], a former at torney general of his State and very  knowledgeable  in  antitrust matters,  who rendered great service on this leg islation. This legislation is truly a bi partisan effort, and I am grateful for  their support.  I would also  like  to  thank the Senate conferees' staffs on  this matter, Steve Markman <Senator  HATCH),  Steve Ross  (Senator METZ ENBAUM),  and  my  counsel,  Steve  Cannon.  Mr. President, H.R. 6027  is  truly  beneficial legislation, without question  it is in the public interest, and I there fore urge adoption of the conference  report.  ",1984
1632,181,23,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President,  I  rise  in  support  of  the  conference  report. I have to take note of the fact  that included in this conference report  is a repeal of the law that we enacted  here and just signed by the President  on August 30 of this year dealing with  the Federal Trade Commission.  On June 28 of this year, the matter  of the Federal Trade Commission's au thority for injunctive procedures and  other actions against the municipali ties and local governments of America  was fully debated. Previously, over on  the House side, they voted overwhelm ingly  to  forbid  the Federal Trade  Commission to move into this particu lar field. They have been in existence  for over 70 years and have never ven tured into trying to run the cities of  America. Following the FTC's initial  incursion into the cities, the House in cluded an amendment on  the Com merce,  Justice, State appropriations  bill to restrict the FTC's activities. We  in the Senate took this matter up at  that particular time and had a confer ence in which there was a strong posi tion on the part of the House and a  split  decision  on  the  part  of  the  Senate with respect to the authority  of the Federal Trade Commission.  As I pointed out in the debate on  June 28, and again at the conference,  the Federal Trade Commission really  was behind in its regular work after a  70-year venture into false and decep tive advertising, and unfair trade prac tices. They had been admonished  in  and by a letter by Chairman DINGELL  and Mr. FLORIO on the House side.  However, when the House thereupon  passed its bill relative to relieving the  cities of  the  treble damages,  it  lan guished over on the Senate side, and  all of those being thanked now were  the ones using their positions of pres sure to state that they were not going  to agree to any bill unless they had  their particular way.  I understand the positions of Sena tors. They are very powerful individ uals. And at  this particular point,  during the closing hours, I have now  worked myself into that same position  of power where  I  could stand and  resist this conference report, and the  change of the antitrust laws, and to  have my way with respect to my belief  with  respect  to  the Federal Trade  Commission's authority over local gov ernments in America. But there is a  time to use the power and a  time to  understand exactly what is the goal.  The goal here is to relieve the cities  of America from Federal intrusion. We  started this particular administration  in 1981 with a Federalism Commission.  I happened to have served at the ap pointment of President Reagan on the  Federalism Commission,  and  I met  many  times with  the distinguished  senior Senator from Nevada, Senator  LAXALT, who was the chairman of that  group. Senator LAXALT, who is inciden tally the chairman of the Subcommit tee on State, Justice, Commerce, and  agreed with my position and along  with the others on this who serve on  the Commerce Committee  that has  the  jurisdictional authority over  the  Federal  Trade  Commission.  Our  thrust in the Federalism Commission  was  to get  the Government off  the  backs of the people, off the local gov ernments, and the entities, get rid of  the  regulations  and  certainly  not  impose a national nanny on the city  councils of America.  We are about  to reimpose that in  this conference report. I  realize that  the goal is more nearly to relieve the  cities of the treble damage threat.  I know if I was a city father and I  was being conscientiously trying to do  my job which requires the regulation  of the economy, which requires regula tions from time to time on the trans portation  facilities, whether  it  be  public transport or private taxi serv ice, regulating from time to time the  zoning regulations, rent control, all of  these matters could very easily become  the subject of what you might call  antitrust.  If you had passed a rent control and,  therefore, that was restraint of trade  in rent as respecting reality in that  particular municipality. Therefore we  would have those going to get a treble  damage verdict against  the city  fa thers. That is an adulteration, a dis tortion of the intent of the Federal  Trade Commission and certainly our  federalism system of Government.  I thought until recently some of the  leaders who have led on this Federal  Trade Commission matter, and this in trusion by  the national nanny-cer tainly in contradiction to their beliefs  that  the best government was  that  nearest to the people might wake up  to what they are actually doing to fed eration.  However,  what  they  are  saying in this conference report is that  the best government is the one fur thest away from the people, the one  here  in Washington.  The  Federal  Trade Commission has no accountabil ity and is not elected by anyone. And  now we are going to reimpose in this  conference report that particular au thority and responsibility.  We will have another day. I want to  see, as I said earlier is, not to have a  chance to use my powers as an individ ual Senator and  threaten  filibuster,  We are not going to hold up all busi ness  like  all  the  lawyer Senators  around here have been doing for their  particular  case,  because  there  are  some 300 suits around, there has been  some verdicts had,  there have been  some jury trials, and there have been  some attempts  to try  to reverse the  jury trials, the verdicts held, and the  procedures already had.  I  resist and  resent  any kind of  retroactivity.  I  resent, frankly, the thrust of many of  those who have held up this particular  measure on threats for 2 months in  the Judiciary Committee.  The House  bill  passed  in  early  August, but it was only here in late  September when we in the Appropria",1984
1633,194,23,Mr. BUMPERS.," Now, Mr. President,  let me take a few moments to pay trib ute  to  the  incomparable  JENNINGS  RANDOLPH.  JENNINGS RANDOLPH  is  a  thinker and a doer and a patriot; he  has been for more years  than most  people in this body have been alive.  JENNINGS  RANDOLPH  impressed me  when I first came to the Senate be cause we were  in  the midst of an  energy crisis, and he went around, as  many Senators will remember, with a  thermometer in his pocket complain ing about  the  temperature all over  these buildings on the Hill. He said,  ""We cannot be serious about energy  conservation when the temperature in  this  room  is  76  degrees."" And he  whipped that thermometer out hun dreds of times the first few years I was  here. But what I did not realize at the  time-we considered it unique, and we  expected  it  of  JENNINGS-but what  most of us did not know at the time is  that JENNINGS had been interested in  energy conservation before most of us  were even born.  If you go to his office, you will find  all that memorabilia that showed that  he promoted the conversion of coal to  aviation gas, or what we used to call as  a child coal oil, before most of us were  born. And you know, Mr. President,  the interesting thing is, he was saying  back in the 1940's-maybe before that,  in the 1930's-that coal was going to  be the prime energy source for  this  country long after oil was gone and  the sooner we  started  to  recognize  that, we would be better off. I daresay  there were a few people in this coun try, as you go back and read history,  who were that visionary but not any body in the U.S. Congress.  So,  carrying  his  thermometer  around, complaining about  the  tem perature and how people were not seri ous  about energy  conservation was  simply an extension of something he  had believed many, many years before  it was popular to believe.  The  thing  I  liked about JENNINGS  when I first came to the Senate was  that he called me by my name.  I  thought, how  interesting. Here  is a  man who has been in the Senate all  these years, and I am just a freshman,  and he already knows my name.  We used to have a Governor who is a  pretty famous person now. He used to  call everybody ""chief,"" and we had  very few people named ""chief.""  Senator RANDOLPH  took the time to  learn the names and something about  all the new Senators, and thereby in gratiated himself with all of us.  I could go back and catalog his legis lative accomplishments. I heard of the  Randolph-Sheppard bill long before I  knew JENNINGS RANDOLPH, and when I  came to the Senate I did not associate  it with  him. After  I  came  to  the  Senate, I would go home on weekends.  We had a little concession stand in the  basement of the Federal Building, and  it was always operated by blind people.  They said: ""Will you tell Senator RAN DOLPH this. Will you tell Senator RAN DOLPH  that."" Then I  realized for the  first  time  that  the Randolph-Shep pard  bill was  JENNINGS  RANDOLPH'S  bill, which gave blind people in this  country  opportunities  which  they  never would have had without his sen sitivity.  I guess it would be best to summa rize and say that it is a lot more im portant how the people back in our re spective States feel about us than it is  about how our colleagues here  feel  about us. But JENNINGS scores 100 per cent on both accounts.  At one  time, shortly after I came  here, JENNINGS asked me to come to  West Virginia to speak to a group, and  I went. Of all  the speeches  I have  made all over the country, with and  for other Senators, I have never seen  such an outpouring of genuine aff ec tion by people as I saw that night in  Charleston, WV, toward JENNINGS.  What was even more important was  his  response-a genuine  caring and  sensitivity  that  he  demonstrated  toward everybody there that evening.  It was truly a thing to behold.  I have watched him here as a cham pion of the environment. More than  anything else, I have watched him as a  champion of his people in West Vir ginia. He  literally cries  in his heart  when he  talks about the unemploy ment rate in West Virginia, because to  JENNINGS  RANDOLPH  that  translates  into the human misery of his people his people whom he has served so well  for all these years.  So, JENNINGS, we will miss you. We  will think of you often. We will hope  to see you often. We will all be anx ious to hear from you. We wish you  Godspeed, good health, and peace.

THE UNENDING SESSION  ",1984
1635,194,23,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, a couple  of days ago I said I wish we would free  the Senate 100. I see that still has not  happened. I hope it will happen soon  because otherwise we are going to see  the ropes going out the side and knot ted sheets out the window and my dis tinguished  seatmate,  Senator  RAN DOLPH and I were talking earlier about  rappeling down the side of the Senate  and leaving this place.  I hope we might do it on a somewhat  more sedate and easygoing way.  The press corps is feeling much the  same way, I am sure. There are rumors  of an impending breakout from there,  but the police have been alerted. Spot lights are being put in place. There are  at least three members of the press  corps who are watching old reruns of  James Cagney movies and we expect  at any moment to hear the dogs bark,  the sirens howl, and the floodlights go  on and out the window they go.  I do not know what this body would  be without them here, however. So I  salute them. That is probably all they  are going to get today.  TRIBUTE TO PAUL TSONGAS  ",1984
1636,194,23,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, on a  more serious note, when I first came  to the U.S. Senate in that same year  my neighboring State of Massachu setts sent from its Fifth District, PAUL  TsoNGAS, to the House of Representa tives. PAUL had served with distinction  there first as a Middlesex County com missioner and then as a Lowell city  councilor.  I think in doing that they sent one  of the most qualified, most sensitive  people the House has had, and then  subsequently he  came  to  the U.S.  Senate, again a move that had to im prove this body.  This  is  a  feeling  that  I  think  is  shared on both sides of the aisle about  this man of sensitivity, brilliance, dedi cation,  compassion,  concern  for his  country, for his State, and most of all  concern for those who have really no  voice in this body.  Senator TsoNGAS made a decision a  few months ago to go home to Massa chusetts, with his wife, Niki, and chil dren Ashley, Katina, and Mollie, be cause of his  concern,  one,  for his  health but also his concern of what  the Senate does to those who want to  have a family life, a real life, the kind  of life that all of us feel entitled to but  so few of us actually have.  I, for one, applaud Senator TsoNGAS'  decision for the reasons he made it. He  has done his share. He has done far  more  for his State and his country  than most people ever have a chance  to do throughout a long, long lifetime.  Having done  this,  though, he real izes that his highest duty and his ulti mate duty is to his family and thus to  ",1984
1637,207,23,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, as we  draw near the end of the 98th Con gress, I want to take a few moments to  set the record straight on the readi ness of our Armed Forces, and espe cially  the  substantial progress  that  has been made by this administration  during the past 4 years.  During hearings this past year, all of  the  Service  Chiefs who  appeared  before  the Senate Armed  Services  Committee  affirmed  the  significant  improvements that have taken place  in quantity and quality of personnel,  force modernization,  readiness  and  sustainability of our Armed Forces.  Because of recurring stories in the  media which  reported negatively on  our military preparedness, I wrote a  letter to the Chief of each of our mili tary services, asking for his assessment  of  the warfighting  capabilities  and  preparedness of his respective service.  The responses  I  received  leave no  doubt of the increased capabilities and  readiness of our military forces. While  all the goals may not have been ac complished during the first 4 years of  this  administration,  these  letters  attest to the substantial progress that  has been made.  I  ask unanimous consent  to have  printed in the RECORD the responses I  received from the Chief of Naval Op erations, Adm. James D. Watkins; the  Chief of Staff of the Army, Gen. John  A. Wickham, Jr.; the Chief of Staff of  the Air Force, Gen. Charles A. Gabri el;  and  the Commandant  of  the  Marine Corps, Gen. P.X. Kelley.  There being no objection,  the  re sponses were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  Press reports of Navy weapons shortages  are at least partly accurate in that supplies  of newer, more sophisticated weapons are  most critical. These shortages stem from in adequate funding in the late 70's, but recov ery is underway. Three years of improved  funding is beginning to take effect. Trends  in spare parts are up also as a result of im proved funding for both ship and aircraft  spares.  I appreciate this opportunity to provide  my thoughts on this issue, and am enclosing  a brief readiness assessment for your use. If  I may be of further assistance, please let me  know.  Sincerely,  JAMES D. WATKINS,  Admiral, U.S. Navy.  READINESS ASSESSMENT  Numbers  reporting  personnel  combat  readiness CCl, C2> since 1981 are up overall,  with surface ships up 39 percent, subma rines up 35 percent and aircraft squadrons  up 115 percent.  Retention across the board is at all time  highs.  93 percent of recruits hold high school di plomas.  Petty officer shortfalls of the early 80's  have been virtually eliminated.  The Naval Reserve is making solid gains  with transition to newest equipments and  will  reach 132,000 Selected Reservists by  1988.  The 600-ship goal is now in hand and will  be reached as planned in 1989.  New ships under contract, both nuclear  and conventional, will provide substantial  increases in capability: 2 CVN's, 9 AEGIS  cruisers, 7 Los Angeles class SSN's, 3 TRI DENT class SSBN's, 6 Oliver Hazard Perry  class FFG's, 34 support ships, and reactiva tion of the third battleship.  Combat readiness up 29 percent for sur face ships, 31 percent for SSN's, 34 percent  for SSBN's and  43  percent  for  aircraft  squadrons since 1981.  Aircraft procurement  is on schedule  to  match the needs of the 600-ship Navy, in cluding 375 new F-14, F/ A-18 and LAMPS  III.  Aircraft mission capable rates up 17 per cent and full mission capable rates up 50  percent overall and even higher  for de ployed units since 1981.  Ordnance  stocks  10-60  percent  higher  than in 1981 with long term outlook even  brighter.  Spare parts already on order will result in  over 50 percent  improvement when deliv ered in FY-86.  CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS,  October 9, 1984.  Hon. JoHN W. WARNER,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR WARNER:  I am responding  to your recent letter in which you expressed  your concern over  recent media  articles  about readiness, many of which are distort ed and factually incorrect criticisms of Navy  warfighting capability.  The true story, in fact, is one of dramatic  recovery. Measured relative to the situation  that existed in 1981, the year which marked  the turning point in readiness and sustain ability funding,  the Navy today has more  weapons and more spare parts at sea, and  better manning of ships and aircraft squad rons. The readiness indices for ships and air craft squadrons are up over 30 percent since  1981.  U.S. ARMY,  THE CHIEF OF STAFF.  Senator JOHN w ARNER,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR WARNER:  I appreciate this  opportunity to provide an assessment of the  state of the Army. The single page response  you requested is enclosed. Also enclosed is a  copy of a paper on ""Total Army Readiness""  which you may find useful.  The Army's warfighting capability has  never been better in peacetime. However,  much work still  remains as we strive  to  attain an Army of Excellence.  Your continued support would be appreci ated by all of us in the Army.  In my opinion the Army today-its people  and resources-are the best I've seen in over  34 years of commissioned service.  Thanks, for your continued solid support.  Most sincerly,  JOHN A. WICKHAM, Jr.,  General, United States Army,  Chief of Staff.  ARMY CAPABILITY  The Army today, all components, is more  capable than at any time in recent history.  This is evidenced by improvements we have  made in force structure, readiness, modern ization, and sustainment.  For many years force structure planning  has  focused  on  developing  those  forces  needed to fight a major war; however, the  actual nature of conflict since World War II  has  been  of mid-to-low  intensity.  The  emerging strategic reality is that forces with  greater flexibility are required to respond to  these kinds of crises while maintaining the  capability to deal with the more dangerous  NATO  contingency.  In  this  respect,  the  Army  is making extensive force structure  changes. Principal changes include reshap ing the heavy divisions, expanding the light  forces, and placing increased reliance on Re serve Component units.  Readiness is the Army's first priority. At  the core of the improvements to Army read iness are the people that serve in uniform;  the quality of our soldiers has never been  better. Building on  this solid core, Army  programs have resulted in soldiers that are  better trained, better equipped, better sup ported,  and better able  to mobilize  and  deploy. Programs most often cited by com manders for providing the biggest readiness  gains  are:  development  of  the National  Training Center, expansion of overseas de ployment training, increased use of training  devices, increased Full-Time Manning in Re serve Component units, expansion of Prepo sitioning of Materiel Configured  in Unit  Sets CPOMCUS>. and increased fielding of  equipment and spare parts.  Extensive actions to modernize equipment  have been taken to counter growing Soviet  capabilities and provide our soldiers with  state-of-the-art equipment. The fielding of  new systems such as the Ml Tank, Bradley  Fighting Vehicle, Black Hawk Helicopter,  Multiple Launch Rocket System, and Per shing II Missile has done much to restore  the qualitative edge we want our forces to  have over potential adversaries. Our soldiers  can now maneuver better, shoot better, com municate better, night fight better, and sup port better. These systems are also neces sary for the employment of new doctrine  which was designed to increase our ability  to fight outnumbered and win.  Finally, our ability to sustain our forces  has been improved significantly through in creases  in war  reserve supplies of equip ment, spare parts, ammunition, and other  materiel.  The consensus of senior Army leaders is  that these improvements have increased the  deterrent value of our land forces. As dem onstrated by Army's performance in Grena da, we can act quickly and effectively should  deterrence fail. Although many challenges  still exist,  today's Army  is capable of re sponding across the entire spectrum of war fare  to protect and preserve our freedom  and national heritage.  ",1984
1638,220,23,Mr. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President,  much has been said recently about the  many accomplishments of our majori ty leader, HOWARD BAKER, and I need  not repeat the accolades he has so de servedly received. Suffice it to say that  his leadership abilities are well docu mented and are represented by deeds,  not just words. His long career in the  Senate has had many highlights,  in cluding  the professionalism he  dis played in pursuing the most difficult  inquiry surrounding Watergate in the  early 1970's. Since I have come to the  Senate,  I  have witnessed  HOWARD  BAKER guide our deliberations with pa tience and strength of purpose. He has  consistently honored the traditions by  which the Senate operates. I  join my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle in  wishing Senator BAKER every success  in the future.  From a very personal point of view I  want to thank Senator BAKER for his  kindness  and  consideration  to me  when I joined the ranks of the Senate  in 1980. I later had the pleasure of ac companying Senator BAKER on a visit  to Alaska when he was on his way to  the Far East. He was kind enough to  appear at the Captain Cook Hotel in  Anchorage, where he addressed a large  gathering of Republicans from all over  the State. The  tribute  that Senator  BAKER paid to me on that occasion was  most meaningful and something I will  always  treasure.  He  departs  the  Senate with an extraordinary record.  Best wishes, my friend.  TRIBUTE TO HOWARD BAKER  ",1984
1639,220,23,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to join my colleagues in paying  tribute to HOWARD BAKER,  the distin guished and able majority  leader of  the U.S. Senate.  Mr. President, we in the Senate are  fond of  ref erring  to each other  in  glowing terms. Rarely, if ever, do we  address  fell ow Members without ac knowledging their distinguished, hon orable, or able status. Some who watch  our proceedings might be inclined to  think that those polite terms of appel lation  have  become  trivialized  and  hackneyed. And  in  some  instances,  they might be right.  But, Mr. President,  I would wager  that  there  is no  in  this body who  refers to the majority leader as distin guished and honorable without  the  utmost sincerity and honesty. HOWARD  BAKER  is indeed a man of distinction,  ability, and honor.  I perhaps have a special fondness for  the majority leader because he is from  Tennessee, which  is  also my wife's  native State. But beyond this special  attachment, I have also developed the  greatest respect for Senator BAKER as  I have worked with him and watched  him perform his leadership duties in  what has to be one of the  toughest  jobs on the face of the Earth.  Throughout his service as majority  leader and regardless of his personal  position  on  particular  legislative  issues, Senator BAKER has consistently  been helpful, understanding, and pa tient in his dealings with me and with  my Senate colleagues. I am especially  and personally grateful to him for the  assistance he gave me in ensuring es tablishment of the Mansfield Founda tion in my home State of Montana.  Mr. President, when the 99th Con gress convenes next January,  I will  feel a true sense of loss at the absence  of How ARD BAKER. I will miss the sense  of  duty,  commitment,  history,  and  humor  that have made him such a  unique and  respected  leader  in  this  legislative body.  I wish the majority leader well in his  future endeavors. And I shall close by  simply bidding a fond farewell to the  distinguished,  honorable,  and  able  Senator from Tennessee.  COMPUTER CRIME LEGISLATION  ",1984
1640,220,23,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, the addi tion of the House computer crime bill  to  the continuing  resolution  in  the  11th hour and 59th minute of  this  Congress is a setback for Americans in  at least two important ways.  First, it is an example of fly-by-night  lawmaking. Second, apart from how  this legislation came to be, in my judg ment it poses a real threat to freedom  of expression and openness in govern ment.  The computer crime provisions of  the crime package were added late last  Thursday night, or maybe early last  Friday morning, by a  small subcom mittee of the conference committee.  In the pressure to move a continuing  resolution forward,  this addition was  approved quickly by the full commit tee, well before any of its implications  surfaced and without any practical op portunity for anyone to ask the kinds  of  questions  that must  always  be  asked, when we pass laws that affect  what Americans  can  say and what  they should know.  After the very swift steps were taken  to add this bill to the continuing reso lution, a number of colleagues and I  expressed  concerns  to Congressman  HUGHES, and we began a serious effort  to bridge some of our differences.  Those efforts did not succeed.  The bill  I  am cosponsoring  today  contains the essence of a compromise  that I think is very worthy of our con sideration, even at this late hour.  Let me  restate  that: Especially at  this late hour.  The most serious problem with the  bill as it now stands is that it makes  every unauthorized disclosure of infor mation from a Government computer  a crime, whether or not the person  doing the disclosing is an employee of  the Government who had legal access  to the computer or a so-called comput er hacker who has gained access to the  computer without permission.  It makes no difference under  this  bill that a Government employee who  has  accessed  the computer  lawfully  discloses information that is not secret  or classified. It can even be informa tion that is available under the Free dom of Information Act.  Now the sponsors of this bill claim  that they have no intention of limiting  whistleblowers. That's a very ingenu ous claim. I see little room for a Gov ernment employee with a  real, but  complex, story  to  tell about miscon duct or gross inefficiency to tell that  story effectively without documenta tion. And even if that documentation  is available to the whistleblower with out the aid of a computer, there will  always be the suspicion that informa tion originated in a computer, and em ployees who  are not  also Supreme  Court Justices are going to be very re luctant to come forward under these  circumstances.  Secrecy in Government is certainly  needed in specific areas where security  and overriding national  interests are  at  stake. On both  the  Intelligence  Committee and Judiciary Committee I  ",1984
1641,285,23,Mr.  KENNEDY.," Mr.  President,  Robert E. Hunter of the Center for  Strategic and International Studies of  Georgetown University wrote a per ceptive analysis of the current diplo matic situation  in  the Middle East  which was recently published in the  Los Angeles Times. I request that the  entire article be printed in the RECORD.  The article follows:  BUT No PEACEMIDDLE  EAST:  STIRRING,  MUCH  MORE  MUST  HAPPEN  BEFORE  PROGRESS TAKES ON MEANING  <By Robert E. Hunter>  Whatever  else  can be  said  about  the  Middle East, it is never quiet. On the eve of  the first visit to Washington by Israel's new  prime minister, Shimon Peres, there is dip lomatic stirring in the region.  Israel has given up its demand that Syrian  forces leave Lebanon at the same time that  Israel withdraws. And,  to  the surprise of  some observers, Damascus has not rejected  the notion that it must be sympathetic to  Israel's security requirements  in southern  Lebanon.  Meanwhile, King Hussein of Jordan has  renewed diplomatic ties with Egypt and re ceived the blessing of Yasser Arafat, ch~ir­ man of the Palestine Liberation Organization.  .  ..  Understanding the long-range s1gnif1cance  of these developments requires looking at  Syria and its ambitions. After the withdraw al from Lebanon last February of U.S. Ma rines and other elements of the multina ' tional  force, Syria became ""king of  the  mountain"" in the Arab world. It had bested  both the United States and Israel in Leba non. It forced Hussein to stop flirting_ with  the Reagan Administration's episodic  ef forts to breathe some life into Arab-Israeli  peacemaking.  At the same time, the two natural and tra ditional rivals for Arab ascendancy, Egypt  and Iraq, were politically cri?pled-Egypt  because of its peace treaty with an Israel  still occupying southern Lebanon, Iraq be cause of its preoccupation with the Iran Iraq war. And Saudi Arabi~,. always a ~~u­ tious follower  in Arab pollt1cs, was dism clined to dispute Syria's new-found leader ship. Clearly, 1984 has proved to be Syria's  year in the Middle East.  Yet  for  its ambitious president, Hafez  Assad  this  short-term  advantage  is not  enough. Assad wants to consolidate Syria'.s  gains for the next generation of Arab poli tics. Thus his victory in Lebanon was o~y  an instrument to a broader purpose. As m  the children's game, however, the king. of  the Arab mountain is by definition subJe~t  to challenge. Syria's position in Lebanon lS  itself a mixed blessing for Damascus. Leba non's competing factions are no more con tent with Syrian domination in much of the  country than they have been with a conge ries of earlier occupiers.  For Assad, therefore, there is some val~e  in helping to ease Israel's departure and, m  time, to moderate Syria's own rol~ in Leba non in the interests of concentratmg on the  broader goal of consolidating Syrian su premacy in Arab politics.  These broader goals  are beginning  to  produce opposition. It is no coincidence that  Hussein decided to patch up relations with  Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, at a time  when Syria and Israel are sending signals to  one another over Lebanon. After the Ameri can elections, the king will want more U.S.  weapons, despite  renewal of his periodic  threats that he will look elsewhere <i.e., the  Soviet Union>. He can't afford to defy Syria  by joining peace talks with Israel, but he  also can't afford to continue being a dog in  the manger, barking at our every peacemak ing effort.  Syria's bow  to  Israel provides  the king  with good political cover. For the moment,  Damascus is poorly placed to press home its  accusations that Hussein is selling out the  Arab cause by making up with Egypt. Hus sein has coupled this act with denunciation  of Israel, but the deed speaks more loudly  than the words.  The glimmerings of a new Jordan-Egypt  axis-blessed by Arafat, whose  followers  were savaged by Syria last year-could be  the start of an Arab challenge to Syria's  dominance. But it is still limited. Syria can,  and will, continue to play its trump card that it alone, among the so-called confronta tion states, is standing up to Israel. Despite  its hints at flexibility in Lebanon, Damascus  is no closer  to accepting  the  renewal of  peace talks with Israel, by anyone or in any  guise.  Indeed,  Syria must  now  dig  in  even  deeper, since preserving its unnatural posi tion of ascendancy in the Arab world de pends on its assertions of Israel's challenge  to Arab interests. Nor is either Hussein or  Mubarak sufficiently confident of his own  future <or  of  support  from other Arab  states> to call Syria's hand by moving in Is rael's direction.  For its part, Israel is in no hurry to see  peace talks resume-either with Egypt over  the West Bank and Gaza <as mandated by  the Camp David Accords> or on some alter native.  Israel's unique experiment in gov ernment-Likud's Yitzhak Shamir will  re place Labor's Peres as prime minister two  years from now-is united on seeking with drawal of Israel's forces from Lebanon and  on doing something about inflation, which  is running at 400% a year. But it is split on  the best approach  to peace, with neither  side able to muster a majority for its vision  of the future.  Politics in the Arab world, therefore, are  hardly more likely than before to produce  for Israel a partner willing to negotiate in  earnest. And Israel is unlikely to take any  initiative other than its appeal to Hussein  <more  pro  forma  than  practical,  and  promptly rejected> to join the peace proc ess. A lot more has to happen in the Arab  world and in outside diplomacy to challenge  Syria's position before Arab-~sraeli p~a?~­ making can again become a serious poss1b1li ty.e  THE  150TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  PUBLICATION  OF  THE  TRIP TO NORTH AMERICA BY  ALEXANDER  FARKAS  DE  BOLON  e ",1984
1642,285,23,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, Pitts burgh was still a fledgling outpost of  the United States when a Transylvan ian Hungarian count, Ferenc Beldy,  and his secretary, Alexander Farkas de  Bolon, visited  it  in 1831. Alexander  Farkas de Bolon's book, ""Utazas Eszakamerikaban,""-Joumey  to  North  America-was  awarded  the Grand  Prize of the Hungarian Academy of  Sciences  despite  its  prohibition  by  Metternich's censors after the publica tion of the first edition in Hungarian.  This work analyzes our constitutional  system and approves it with an enthu siasm shared not even by Alexis de  Tocqueville, whose work, ""Democracy  in America,"" was published a  year  later in 1835.  While this book remained unknown  in the United States until the 1970's, it  is worthwhile today to repeat the tes timony of  this convinced Democrat  and believer in the republican system  of government. If I may quote his de scription of my city, Pittsburgh,  in  1831:  Pittsburgh is located at the confluence of  the mighty Allegheny and Monongahela  Rivers which  form  the Ohio here. They  originate in opposite directions. The Alle gheny in the north at Lake Erie, and the  Monongahela in the Laurel Mountains of  Virginia. Both are fed by many tributaries  forming the Ohio at Pittsburgh, which, fol lowing a  twisting course for two hundred  miles, empties into the Mississippi and ulti mately into the Gulf of Mexico. Through  these waterways Pittsburgh has the key to  the north, south, and the west and now an  open route to the east all the way to the  ocean by way of  the new 300-mile-long  Pennsylvania Canal. In addition to this fa vored location nature lavished on it more of  its blessings. In the bowels of its mountains  there are rich deposits of  iron, coal, and  salt. Pittsburgh seemed to have been des tined to be an industrial center.  After the War of Independence, Ameri cans quickly discovered its superior location  and riches. Craftsmen both American and  European  flocked  to settle here and  the  population greatly increased in a very short  time:  1800 ......................................................... .  1,565  1810 ......................................................... .  4,768  1820 ......................................................... .  7,242  1825 ......................................................... .  12,542  1830 ......................................................... .  17,000  The population outside of the native born  are mostly English, Scots, Irish, as well as  many Germans, but all these are by now  completely Americanized. Where  the  law  does not  tear people apart  into separate  classes, where everyone enjoys equal rights,  there, everyone wants to be part of the new  freedom and the new fatherland. They rush  to learn the language and even change their  names to become completely Americanized.  Mr. President,  today  I  salute  the  American Hungarians, who emigrated  to Pittsburgh. These people, immortal ized by Alexander Farkas de Bolon,  gained both the respect and friendship  of their fell ow citizens through hard  work, honesty, and patriotism. Indeed,  their efforts  to preserve democracy  have been exemplary since the Revo lutionary War. It is especially signifi cant that Alexander Farkas de Bolon  came  from Transylvania where  the  Hungarians, now forced to live under  Romanian rule, are being oppressed by  a  totalitarian regime which did not  shed its chauvinistic prejudices either.

1643,311,23,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President, H.R.  5616 would create two new sections of  the Federal Criminal Code <title 18  United States Code). New section 1029  addresses  fraudulent  use  of  credit  cards and similar access devices, while  new section 1030 deals with computer  fraud and abuse. The amendment that  I now offer, along with the Senator  from Vermont CMr. LEAHY], and the  [Mr.  Senator  from Massachusetts  KENNEDY], concerns only the latter of  these sections. The amendment makes  the changes needed to conform H.R.  5616 to the changes made by the con ference committee on the continuing  resolution (H.J. Res. 648), to which a  computer crime provision was append ed. However, the amendment does not  stop there. It goes on to make two ad ditional changes which are necessary  to correct serious flaws in the version  passed as part of the continuing reso lution.  First, proposed subsection 1030(a)(3)  <as included in the continuing resolu tion> makes it a crime to ""knowingly  use        or disclose  information  in  [any] computer       operated for or  on behalf of the Government of the  United States,"" so long as the comput er is accessed without authorization,  or if the scope of authorized access is  exceeded. By its terms, this provision  applies even if disclosure of inf orma tion is mandated under the Freedom  of Information Act. Since more and  more of the vast store of Government  information is held in computer data  bases,  the scope of proposed section  1030(a)(3) is extremely broad. It may  be read, in effect, as a blanket antidis closure statute, and its enactment in  its current form threatens to impede  the  efficient  administration of  the  Freedom of Information Act.  I have been advised that the primary  intent of the authors of this provision  is to prevent the disclosure by comput er trespassers of personally identifia ble information of the kind protected  by the Privacy Act of 197 4, and not to  graft an inquiry as to access authoriza tion onto existing FOIA procedures.  But I am skeptical that this result can  be achieved without explicit statutory  language restricting the scope of the  prohibition against disclosure of data  base  information. Accordingly,  this  amendment  revises proposed subsec tion 1030Ca)(3). While the prohibitions  against destruction, modification, or  prevention of the use of computerized  information are unchanged, the prohi bitions against the use or disclosure of  such information are limited to indi vidually identifiable information pro tected by the Privacy Act.  The second flaw  in the continuing  resolution version of  this  legislation  has been brought to our attention by  representatives  of  the  intelligence  community.  They  argue  forcefully  that the literal terms of the legisla tion, as passed in the continuing reso lution, will impede and perhaps even  require the termination of certain in telligence activities. They suggest the  inclusion of a statutory exception for  lawfully authorized  law enforcement  and intelligence activities. Our amend ment provides such an exception, in  language  borrowed  from  the False  ",1984
1644,363,23,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President,  regretfully, the Congress will adjourn  tonight without approving a highway  bill. This is a great disappointment for  me and a loss to my State.  Part of the bill under consideration,  H.R. 5504, was approval of the inter state cost estimate. Approval of this  so-called ICE is necessary for DOT to  release  interstate  construction  and  substitution program funds.  In New  Jersey, that would have meant the re lease of $75 million in 1984 funds and  well over $100 million in 1985 funds.  Highway improvements and thousands  of jobs were at stake in approval of  the  I.C.E. Unfortunately,  release of  these funds will now be further de layed, disrupting highway programs  and depriving our citizens of work.  Another provision lost with our fail ure to approve a conference report on  H.R. 5504 was authorization of a dem onstration project to complete a long  delayed segment of Route 21 in Passa ic County in New Jersey. The comple tion of Route 21 is essential to revital ization efforts currently underway in  this older, distressed city. The busi ness community, local elected officials,  Representative BoB RoE, and I have  made this project a top priority. Link ing this route, which has been cut off  from major cities and east-west routes  for a dozen years or more, with other  major interstates is critical to Passaic's  revitalization.  Differences  between  House  and  Senate conferees on the treatment of  demonstration projects authorized by  the highway bill in each Chamber ulti mately led to the defeat of the high way bill. As late as this afternoon, I  believed  the Senate conferees made  progress  toward  reaching a  compro mise on the treatment of demonstra tion projects. Ultimately, the confer ence  broke  down  because  of  veto  threats from the White House and re maining differences over the level of  State participation that should be re quired in implementing demonstration  projects and disagreement over  the  treatment  of  the  Central Artery  Project in Boston.  Also lost to New Jersey with the fail ure of this bill was authorization for a  $200,000  feasibility study for a pro posed west to east highway project in  southern New Jersey. I sponsored this  provision in the Senate Environment  and Public Works Committee; Con gressman BILL HUGHES  sponsored a  companion  version  in  the House.  Progress toward this project is impor tant in southern New Jersey, which is  among the fastest growing parts of my  State and heavily  traversed as  resi dents  from New  Jersey  and other  States seek to enjoy the beaches of  New Jersey.  Mr. President, both of  these  are  projects which I hope can receive re newed attention  from  the Congress  next year. Further, I hope we will be  able to find a better means of dealing  with approval of the interstate cost es timate  in  the  future. The Federal  highway program plays a critical role  across  this country,  in maintaining  and building our highway system and  providing work for our citizens. Con tinuous deadlock on unrelated issues  should not repeatedly place obligation  of Federal highway funds in jeopardy.  Mr. President, the chairman of the  Environment and Public Works Com mittee, Senator  STAFFORD,  and  the  ranking Democratic member, Senator  RANDOLPH, tried their best, within the  limits imposed on them, to clear a bill  for action this year. I look forward to  working with members on the commit tee again, early next year, to enact a  highway bill.  TO  IM TECHNICAL  AMENDMENTS  THE  FEDERAL  COURTS  PROVEMENT ACT OF 1982  ",1984

Mr. Speaker, we are on the consider ation of an amendment to the Senate  amendment to the House bill.  Just to refresh our memories,  the  Members will recall that the Export  Administration  Amendments  Act  passed this House last October. While  we were in conference, a simple exten sion became necessary because of the  long conference and the expiration of  the President's authority under  the  Export  Administration  Act.  That  simple extension has been over with  the other body.  When after 7 months in the confer ence we had reached agreement on  almost everything and we got down to  the last few hours of this session, the  other body undertook to put their ver sion of an Export Administration Act  renewal on the simple extension bill  and sent it to this House.  When it was received here one of the  major provisions dealing with sanc tions on South Africa, which had been  previously  included  in  the House  passed bill, was not there.  The  House  amendment  to  the  Senate amendment before us now re stores the language that was included  in the House passed bill and makes  some other technical changes that are  essential if this matter is to ultimately  become law.  So  that  is  the  issue  today, Mr.  Speaker. Because of the short time re maining in the session, there was no  other way to get the matter before us.  We express our appreciation  to  the  Rules Committee, Members on both  sides, who undertook to give us this  opportunity to get the matter to the  floor, notwithstanding  the fact  that  the House has already acted on this  provision.  It becomes essential right now, if we  are going to have any chance at all  with respect to a new Export Adminis tration Act,  to get  this amendment  adopted and send it to the other body  where  they have greater  flexibility.  They can move with more speed then  we can, when they make up their mind  to do so, and perhaps we can salvage  something out of this bill.  Mr.  Speaker,  before  I  turn  this  matter over for further discussion on  the technical aspects of it, let me pay  my respects  to the chairman of the  subcommittee,  the  gentleman  from  Washington [Mr. BONKER];  the rank ing member, the gentleman from Wis consin  [Mr. RoTHl; and other mem bers of the subcommittee and the full  committee  who  have  worked  far  beyond and above the call of duty.

1666,454,23,Mr.  FISH.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the minority would like  to participate in this very high-level  discussion here before we get on to the  merits of the conference report. I cer tainly concur with what the gentle man from Ohio has said, and what the  chairman of the committee has said,  that the antitrust laws deal with con centrations of economic power, where as government choices are not profit  motivated.  Prior to the Lafayette case, we did  not know that the municipalities were  subject to the antitrust laws. In fact,  we felt they had the same immunity  as do the States. And it is that that we  are trying to rectify here today.  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1  minute to my friend,  the gentleman  from Pennsylvania CMr. GEKAS], on  this subject.  ",1984
1667,454,23,Mr. GEKAS.,"  I  thank  the distin guished gentleman from New York.  I just wanted to add to that already  stated premise that the real difference  between these two subjects happens to  be the fact that the targets of one;  namely, the suits against local govern ments, are eventually  the  taxpayers  who support those local governments;  and, on the other hand,  the  target  would  be  the  entrepreneur  profit  result of money making, which is laud able and which we extol and which we  need, but that is the essential differ ence.  ",1984
1668,454,23,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, would  my friend from New York yield for  just a moment?  ",1984
1669,454,23,Mr. GEKAS., I yield back the bal ance of my time.  ,1984
1670,454,23,Mr. FISH.," Mr. Speaker, I would be  happy to yield to the gentleman.  ",1984
1671,454,23,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Let me address my  friend from Pennsylvania. The gentle man from Kentucky is not unmindful  of the fact that the taxpayers would  have to pay in some form of taxation  any award directed to the municipality  for an antitrust violation, but what I  am saying is, is it right and fair that  small business or other business which  is  constrained  and which  is  acted  against by a city or a county acting in  restraint of trade, acting against the  law, as we have it up to date, is it right  that that  individual would have no  right of action?  If I understand correctly, what they  have here is an opportunity to get a  restraining order against future anti trust violations. But if I am a business  person and I  lose a contract because  there is connivance between State and  local authorities and some other com pany, I have no recourse, I have no  place to go, I do not get any award at  all.  So I am sorry for the taxpayer, but I  also feel a little sorry for the business  who now faces this Goliath and has no  cause of action.  ",1984
1672,454,23,Mr. GEKAS., I agree with the gentle man. But it is apples and oranges we  are  talking about.  I happen  to  like  both apples and oranges.  ,1984
1673,454,23,Mr. FISH.," Mr. Speaker, the gentle man from Kentucky should know that  in this bill if the action of the munici pality is beyond its authority, then an  action does lie by the small business men the gentleman was citing.  ",1984
1674,454,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, will  the gentleman yield?  ",1984
1675,454,23,Mr. FISH., I yield to the gentleman  from Ohio.  ,1984
1676,454,23,Mr. SEIBERLING.,"  In addition  to  that, if there were conspiracy between  local  officials  and  private  parties,  treble damage action would lie against  the private parties. This bill only ex empts actions by government and ac tions directed by government.  ",1984
1677,454,23,Mr. FISH.," Mr. Speaker, now for the  purposes of presenting this conference  report to this House, I yield 5 minutes  to  the gentleman from  Illinois CMr.  HYDE] who introduced almost 2 years  ago the first bill that became part of  the  legislation  that we  are dealing  with today.  ",1984
1678,454,23,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, if I could  just respond, briefly, to some of the  comments made  by  the gentleman  from Kentucky, who apparently has  left the floor,  the difference,  really,  between antitrust law's applicability to  commercial transactions is that it only  looks at one issue, and that is the anti competitive nature  of  the  conduct  complained of.  Competition is important in free en terprise and the operation of our eco nomic system. When you move over to  governmental decisions, then the com petitive factor is not relevant, really,  or far less relevant than environmen tal  considerations,  health  consider ations,  safety considerations,  and a  whole panoply of issues that a govern mental body must take into consider ation in its judgments allocating con tracts, access  to sewer  lines, zoning,  and things like that.  D 1430  So it is clear that the antitrust laws  ought  to be  inapplicable  to govern mental  decisions  certainly  in  their  most harsh aspect and that is treble  damages  for governmental decisions.  The problem is governments make de cisions, State governments and local  governments, based on their best judg ment on a range of considerations that  are  not  contemplated  by  antitrust  laws. So the antitrust law is a square  peg trying to be forced into the round  hole of governmental operation. This  remedy is very much needed.  This is important legislation. I might  point out parenthetically  that  this  body can move if its priorities are such  that  they want  to move. We have  waited 2 years since the Boulder case  gave us this ticking bomb, and we fi nally, on the last day of the session,  have a bill before us. That is glacier like activity; I do not know why. I am  sure there are good reasons, but I do  look at this in the background in the  bill offered by  the gentleman  from  Oklahoma,  the  chairman  of  the  Budget Committee, which was filed in  1 week and was up here 7 days later  for a vote.  So we can move in meteoric fashion  or glacier fashion depending again on  the issue. Nevertheless, we are here,  thank God, we have a bill and it is a  good bill and I want it to be adopted.  The statement of managers on H.R.  6027  emphasizes  the  protections  against money damages afforded  in  this legislation are potentially applica ble to pending cases through case-by case determinations by  the district  courts.  The statement of managers on H.R.  6027 emphasizes that the protections  against money damages afforded  in  this legislation are potentially applica ble to pending cases through case-by case determinations by  the district  courts. The conferees agreed that ""the  court  is  to consider all relevant cir cumstances."" While  the  language of  subsection 3(b) of the bill only men tions two of the factors that the court  should consider-that is, the stage of  litigation and the availability of alter native relief under the Clayton Act the court is free to consider other rele vant factors that led to the local gov ernment  decision  being  challenged  under the antitrust laws. In this analy sis,  the  conferees  intend  that  the  courts be allowed to consider factors  other than just impact on competition  and mere marketplace factors. So, for  example, included among the factors  that courts should consider in evaluat ing whether or not a current local gov ernment defendant should be protect ed from money damages would be the  following:  First, whether the unit of local gov ernment was exercising its legislative,  regulatory, executive, administrative,  or judicial authority;  Second, the adverse impact that an  antitrust damage award would have on  the unit of local government and its  residents; and  Third, whether the action taken by  the unit of local government was in  furtherance of Federal or State laws,  policies, or regulations.  In the context of this legislation, it  also should be emphasized  that the  Supreme Court has never ruled that  local  governments  that violate  the  Federal antitrust  laws may be held  liable for money damages. In fact, no  final  judgment has been entered as sessing such damages against any lo cality. That issue is open and is pres",1984

1706,532,23,Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI.," Mr. Speak er, H.R. 5386 passed the House of Rep resentatives unanimously on October  l, 1984. The bill provides for an in crease in the payment rates for home  care under the hospice benefit from  $46.25 to $53.17 a day.  The Senate has today passed H.R.  5386 and added three new sections:  1. PUBLIC PENSION OFFSETS  The 1983 Social Security  amend ments contained a permanent public  pension offset provision which treats a  Government pension received by the  spouse of a Social Security beneficiary  as being made up of two separate com ponents: a Social Security equivalent  and a private pension equivalent. This  provision applies only to persons who  become eligible for their public pen sions after June 1983.  The Senate amendment to H.R. 5386  is virtually identical to the House ver sion of the offset which was rejected  in conference by the Senate in Decem ber 1982. The House position in 1982  was  that since  this approach made  sense for persons becoming newly eli gible, it also made sense for all benefi ciaries. The Senate has agreed with  our reasoning after almost 2 years.  The House should concur with  the  Senate amendment.  2. AMENDMENTS TO THE FOSTER CARE ACT  The Senate amendment to H.R. 5386  also extends for 1 year two foster care  provisions which expired on Septem ber 30,  1984.  Identical amendments  were passed by the House on October  l, 1984 as part of H.R. 6266.  One of the provisions to be extended  provides authority for States to claim  Federal matching funds for children  who are placed in foster care under a  voluntary placement  agreement  be tween the agency and the child's par ents. The other provision allows States  to transfer funds allocated to them for  foster care  to use for child welfare  services.  3.

The word I am  ref erring to is ""priority"". The defini tion  is a  simple one;  the quality or  state of being prior, taking precedence  of importance.  One would hope  that  the distin guished Members of this body would  operate on this principle of priority  and importance. But this did not seem  the case yesterday as we debated and  voted on the continuing resolution.  But first,  let me take you back in  time a few hours before the continu ing resolution to a bill of vast impor tance and consequence. S. 2562, which  was also debated in the House yester day,  provided  for waiver-of-interest  payments and for repayment of princi pal of bonds of the John F. Kennedy  Center for the Performing Arts.  I will not go into the details of this  profound piece of legislation except to  say it dealt with a few million dollars  and affects only a small special-inter est group concerned with the perform ing arts which I have nothing against.  But there is one aspect of the two  different  pieces  of  legislation  that  were debated and voted on yesterday  that appalls me. The Kennedy Center  bill which involved a few million dol lars had  two  recorded votes  taken,  which noted each Member's stand on  the legislation. But no recorded vote  was  taken on the continuing resolu tion that involved $470 billion of the  taxpayers' money.  While I think the Kennedy Center  bill did indeed warrant debate and the  recorded votes, there is really no com parison to the magnitude of the con tinuing resolution compared with the  Kennedy Center legislation.  Where is the justice of this decision?  The people in this country need an ac curate record of each Member's vote.  Our actions  in  this body should be  held accountable by those who elect us  to this office. A decision as paramount  as  this demands a  recorded vote, so  that our constituents may  judge ac cordingly in the upcoming election as  October 11, 1984  to whether we have acted responsibly  with the vast control of the revenues  received from taxation.  With these remarks, I would like to  state for the record that I am opposed  to the waste and exorbitant spending  that will occur through the passage of  this resolution. Everyone talks about  balancing the budget and curbing the  huge deficits, but few are willing to  make  the needed  sacrifices  for  the  sake of our economy and our Nation.e  AN AMERICAN CLASSIC  HON. WIWAM D. FORD  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 11, 1984  e ",1984
1713,558,23,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er,  before  leaving Washington,  I  wanted to take this opportunity to tell  you  of  a  very  important birthday  about  to  be  celebrated. The Ford  Thunderbird turns 30 in 1985 and the  Ford Motor Co. is commemorating this  special event. The 30-year history is  explained well in the following news  release  from  the Ford Motor Co.  I  know you'll enjoy  reading  this and  reminiscing about this enduring car.  TllmmERBIRD-A LEGEND ToRNs 30  Until the mid 1950's, Thunderbird has its  place only in lore and the dictionary. Today,  the word calls up images, of sleek, powerful  automobiles cruising along American high ways and by-ways. Ford made it so in 1955.  The Ford Thunderbird turns 30 in 1985.  Over those three decades, it has more than  lived up to its charge as an industry trend setter-a car for car lovers.  Thirty years of Thunderbirds have includ ed the classic two-seaters that started it all  and collectors' cars in practically every ver sion since then. Thunderbird has starred at  the races and in the movies. And, the latest  models-the aerodynamically shaped look of-the-future Thunderbirds  introduced  in  1983-are obviously destined for a promi. nent place  in Thunderbird-and automo tive-history.  Thunderbird joined the Ford car family in  1955 as an eyecatching, two-seater intended  as a sports car. It single-handedly started  the personal  luxury car segment of  the  market in the United States.  When it debuted February 20, 1954 at the  Detroit Auto Show, the car had it all-the  looks, the performance, the promise-except  for one important ingredient-the name. It  was nameless.  The name came from a Ford car stylist  who won a  suit of clothes  for entering  Thunderbird in a  long list of choices in a  name-that-car contest.  The first production car bearing the leg endary name and emblem rolled off the line  at Ford's Dearborn (Mich.) Assembly Plant  September 9, 1954. The first one was sold  October 22 of that year. The new two-seat ers were 52.l inches high with a 102-inch  wheelbase  and  a  curb weight  of  2,833  pounds.  The standard powertrain was a modified  V-8 that put out 160 horsepower  teamed  with  a  three-speed manual  transmission.  ",1984
1714,662,23,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, I wish  to announce  for  the  information of  Senators  that  the Subcommittee on  Defense of the Committee on Appro priations is planning to hold hearings  during the interim between the 98th  and 99th Congresses. These hearings  may be held here in Washington, DC,  or at other locations. Details will be  provided in the final issues of the CON GRESSIONAL RECORD for the 98th Con gress.  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  AN ACT OF HEROISM  e ",1984
1715,662,23,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  this week  in Geneva  the Nansen  Medal, the highest honor for humani tarian efforts on behalf of refugees,  was  awarded  to  three  American  seaman, Capt. Lewis M. Hiller, Mr.  Jeffrey H. Kass, and Mr. Gregg Turay  for their heroism in the rescue of 86  Vietnamese  ""boat  people""  off  the  north coast of Borneo.  The award was made by Mr. Paul  Hartling, U.S. High Commissioner for  Refugees, and may be said  to be a  statement of world opinion, or more to  the point, the opinion of that portion  of the world that does not drive its in habitants to the desperate efforts of  escape  such as  these we have wit nessed from totalitarian Vietnam for a  decade now.  It is  in order that the  United States do so as well. Were we  not in the closing hours of the 98th  Congress, I would propose a resolution  of gratitude  to  the captain and her  valiant crew, members of the Seafar ers' International Union.  If I may be allowed a personal ref er ence, my son John McCloskey Moyni han has sailed as a member of  the  crew of  the Rose City,  and he has  more than once described to me the  quiet heroism of these merchant mari ners. I am confident the Senate joins  me in expressing admiration for this  only most recent incident of the valor  of those who go down to the sea in  ships.  I submit for the RECORD an article  relating to this matter:  [From the New York Times, Oct. 9, 19841  DARING ""BOAT PEOPLE"" RESCUE BRINGS  HONOR TO 3 AMERICANS  <By Henry Kamm)  GENEVA, October 8.-Chua Quach was not  present at an awards ceremony here today  at which three American seaman were hon ored by Paul Hartling of Denmark,  the  United Nations High Commissioner for Ref ugees.  Yet no one knows better than Mr. Quach,  a Vietnamese refugee who now works as a  laborer in a furniture factory in Philadel phia, what happened on the night of Sept.  23, 1983,  in the stormy sea off the north  coast of Borneo.  That was when Capt. Lewis M. Hiller  stopped his 94,000-ton  tanker,  the Rose  City, and went to the aid of Mr. Quach and  85 other refugees who were adrift in a small  boat. Neither Mr. Quach nor the other refu gees were present at the award ceremony  today.  Without  the  heroic  assistance  of  the  Americans, Mr. Quach says, he would have  died that night, together with his son. So  would the other Vietnamese ""boat people""  adrift with him in the South China Sea without food, with water only for the chil dren  and  having burned most  of  their  clothes  in eight days  and nights  trying  vainly to signal passing ships.  The award given  to Captain Hiller and  two crew members, Jeffrey H. Kass and  Gregg Turay, was the Nansen Medal, the highest honor for humanitarian efforts on  behalf of refugees. It was presented at the  Palace of Nations here by Mr. Hartling on  behalf of a special committee. The group,  similar to the one that awards the Nobel  Peace Prize, is made up of representatives of  Norway and other governments and interna tional organizations.  MANY BOATS ARE IGNORED  Since Vietnamese  began  fleeing  their  country in great numbers in 1975, accounts  have multiplied of  their small, often dis abled, boats' being ignored by merchant ves sels whose masters are eager to avoid the  often time consuming, and thus expensive,  formalities of bringing the refugees to land.  Mr. Quach, said that ""more than 10"" ships  had passed  the refugee vessel before  the  American tanker stopped. He recalled that  crew members on one ship wa.ved in greeting  as the ship sailed out of sight of the refugee  boat.  SWAM TO SAVE 2  Mr. Quach said in an interview from the  United States  that he was  particularly  grateful to Mr. Kass, 31 years old, a seaman  from Seattle whose chief activity when he is  not at sea is tending an organic garden on  an island off Vancouver.  Mr. Kass swam through turbulent waters  at night to rescue Mr. Quach, 43, and his 8year-old son, who had clung to a lifesaver  for two hours.  ""He saved not only our lives but that of  my wife, who remained behind in Vietnam,""  Mr. Quach said, his voice choking. ""She  would have committed suicide if our son had  drowned.""  Mr. Quach said that at the time of the  rescue, there was no food a.nd little water  left on the rickety boat, heavily overloaded  with 36 men, 20 women and 30 children. A  16-year-old girl drowned during the rescue  operation.  ""NEVER DONE MY DUTY""  When he decided  to escape, Mr. Quach  had just been released after seven and a  half years  in  a  ""re-education""  camp,  to  which he was confined for having been a  lieutenant in the South Vietnamese Army.  ""I had never done my duty as a father to  my son,"" he said, ""so my wife and I decided  we had to do this.""  Mr. Quach and his son said they hoped  Mrs. Quach would soon be able  to  leave  Vietnam and join them.  When the lights of the Rose City beck oned in the distance, Mr. Quach said, he  had abandoned hope for two days and was  devoting all his time to consoling his son,  ""to spend my time on him before we die.""  ""I held my son to my bosom and waited  for the time to die,"" said Mr. Quach, a grad uate of Saigon University in linguistics who  speaks fluent English.  He was chosen to be the first to try to  climb aboard the Rose City, which had let  down rope ladders. ""I was supposed to lie,""  he said. ""I was supposed to say we were 50,  because we feared we would be refused if I  said we were about 90.""  He never  told his  lie, because his son  slipped out of his embrace as he tried to  climb the ladder and Mr. Quach jumped in to the sea after him. ""I didn't think,"" he  said ""I knew  couldn't live without my  son.""  Fortunately, he had instructed the child  before leaving Vietnam in how to stay un derwater. He had made his son immerse his  head fully in a tub, successively lengthening  the time the child held his breath. They  reached one of the life rings Captain Hiller  had ordered  thrown  towa.rd  the  refugee  boat.  From his reading, Mr. Qua.ch recalled that  lifesavers had signal lights attached. ""When  I found it and turned it on,"" he said, ""I felt  hope and told my son we would be rescued.  But  time passed and nobody came. The  Rose City got smaller and smaller, and I  came to lose hope.""  ""I told my son, 'I'm very sorry I haven't  done my duty as a father.""  I  ",1984
1716,701,23,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, I  rise  today to honor a man by the name of  James Thomas Vocelle. When I men tion his name, it immediately recounts  to me fond memories of his outstand ing life and career of public office. I  am not the only one that appreciates  his outstanding service. The  Indian  River County Bar Association is spon soring a  luncheon on November 29,  this year in recognition of the 60 years  Mr. Vocelle has practiced law in Flori da. Jim is having quite a life you see;  his father and uncle defended the con federacy during the period of North ern Aggression-Civil War. Jim him self was a war veteran; he fought for  the U.S. Army during WWI. He served  with distinction and today is an active  member of the American Legion.  His professional career  is notewor thy to say the least. He is a member of  the Florida, Georgia, and New Mexico  bar dating back to 1916 when he was  admitted to the Georgia bar. He has  counseled many clients over the years,  and  is known for his reputation for  being  fair and  just and for helping  thousands of people who could not  afford counsel. Today, Jim is actively  engaged in his private practice in his  hometown of Vero Beach.  Jim's public service began  in 1918  when he was appointed as county at torney of Camden County, GA. Two  years later he was elected to the State  house, and in 1922 elected to the Geor gia Senate. In 1925, Jim's faithful, pro ductive,  and honest  service  to  the  State of Florida began. Jim was the  first county attorney of Indian River.  Subsequently,  in 1941 Gov. Spessard  L. Holland appointed Jim as a commis sioner of Florida First Parole Commis sion. During his tenure on the Com mission, Mr. Vocelle was elected presi dent of the Southern State Parole and  Probation Association. While there, he  successfully emphasized and then in troduced  to  the South some of  the  modern  reforms of penology which  stressed  off ender  rehabitation  and  human  dignity. Governor Caldwell  later appointed Jim State beverage di rector. In 1953 Gov. Dan McCarty ap pointed Mr. Vocelle chairman of the  Florida  Industrial Commission,  the  forerunner of today's Florida Depart ment of Labor and Employment Secu rity. He was the first State official to  grasp the plight of migrant farm work ers,  and  implemented  programs  in  regard  to  the needs and rights. For  those who do not know Jim Vocelle  personally,  it is obvious that he has  always been a staunch champion of  human rights, without regard to race,  sex, creed, or origin, and is committed  to  the dignity  and  equality  of  all  people.  Mr. President, it is with great pride  that I shared with you the splendid  life and many achievements and ac complishments of my good friend Jim  Vocelle.e  COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF  AMERICA-PAY EQUITY STUDY  e ",1984
1717,701,23,Mr. CRANSTON.," Mr. President, on  October 3, during the Senate's consid eration of House Joint Resolution 648,  the continuing resolution, I sought to  off er an amendment to require a study  of  the Federal Government's wage  classification  system  to  determine  whether workers  in positions  filled  predominately by  female  employees  are paid less than workers in positions  in which male workers predominate,  although the job qualifications, work ing conditions, and requirements are  comparable. Although the pay equity  study amendment, which had passed  the House in June by an overwhelm ing bipartisan vote, was not adopted,  an agreement was  reached between  myself and the distinguished Senator  from  Alaska  [Mr.  STEVENS],  who  Chairs  the Subcommittee  on Civil  Service, Post Office and General Serv ices of the Senate Committee on Gov ernmental Affairs,  as well  as  the  Chairman of the House Committee on  Post Office  and Civil Service  [Mr.  FORD]  and  the Chair of  the House  Subcommittee on Compensation and  Employee Benefits [Ms. OAKAR], on a  series of events to take place over the  next 8 months to bring about this type  of review of the Federal Wage Classifi cation System. That agreement is set  forth in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of  October 10, 1984, at 31143.  In the meantime, many similar ef forts  are  taking place  in both  the  public  and  private  sectors.  In  this  regard, I recently received a copy of a  very  informative  special  report  on  wage  discrimination  issued  by  the  Communications Workers of America.  This  report,  entitled  ""Closing  the  Wage Gap"" was prepared by a special  CWA task force on pay equity. It pro vides a comprehensive overview of the  pay equity problem as well as possible  strategies for rectifying wage discrimi nation. The report outlines some of  the successes achieved by this union L.'1  bargaining for pay  increases  to help  close the wage gap as well as its activi ties in legislative and judicial areas.  Mr. President, I ask that the CW A  report be printed in the RECORD.  The report follows:  CLOSING  THE WAGE GAP:  BACKGROUND ON  WAGE DISCRIMINATION GUIDE TO EQUITY IN  THE WORKPLACE  INTRODUCTION  There is a big problem in America's work place: women earn less than men. This prob lem  is pervasive, affecting every  industry  and occupation; it is persistent, dividing the  sexes  in spite of major economic, demo graphic  and political  changes; and  it  is  unfair, imposing second class citizenship on  half of this country's population.

1719,766,23,Mr. PHILIP M. CRANE.," Mr. Speak er, I would like to take this opportuni ty to elaborate on the fallowing article  that recently appeared in the Chicago  Sun-Times, dealing with my friend and  our colleague, HENRY HYDE. In the 10  years that HENRY has been a Member  of this distinguished body, he has gone  to great lengths to ensure that ethics  and morality are incorporated into the  legislative process. Of greatest notorie ty was HENRY'S successful efforts  to  pass the Hyde amendment, which pro hibits the use of Federal funds to pay  for abortions except in certain extenu ating circumstances. Recently, in reply  to an earlier speech by New York's  Gov. Mario Cuomo, HENRY  also ex pertly defended the notion that reli gion belongs in both politics and in the  legislative process. HENRY  is commit ted to the ideals that he believes in,  and  is extremely capable of leading  the fight  to make certain that they  are not violated or infringed upon.  Oftentimes  it  is easy  to make en emies  during  partisan  political  de bates. yet HENRY'S character and style  allow him to defend his position withEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  out  jeopardizing the respect that he  has earned  from both sides of  the  aisle. To this end, I am submitting this  article as a tribute to a great man, a  true patriot, and an asset to the House  of Representatives.  I commend it to your attention.  The article follows:  [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Oct. 8, 19841  HENRY HYDE-EVEN OPPONENTS FIND HIM  UNHATEABLE  <By Joseph Sobran>  On Nov. 7,  the political map of America  will change. The decades of liberal fashion  finally will be over, and  the conservative  revolution will have added  to  its gains of  1980.  Conservatives will find themselves joined  by opportunist who a  few years ago were  voting  against  them. There  is  nothing  wrong with attracting opportunists; it is the  price, or the reward, of success. In politics  you accept fair-weather friendship.  All  the same, this  is a good moment to  salute those who were conservatives before  conservatism was the winning side. And few  deserve more honor than Rep. Henry Hyde  of Illinois.  Hyde is a tall, wide, handsome man with a  personality  so  jovial  as  almost  to make  Ronald Reagan seem like Walter Mondale.  He  is best known as  the author of the  Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use  of Medicaid funds for abortion, and he  is  the chief political hero of the right-to-life  movement.  He  also  is  a  conservative Republican  whose  colleagues,  including  Democrats,  speak warmly of him and rate him one of  the House's best-informed students of for eign affairs.  Last month, Hyde spoke at the University  of Notre Dame on abortion, religion and pol itics, in implicit reply to the earlier speech  there of New York's Gov. Mario Cuomo.  A distinguished New York reporter who  admires Cuomo even more than I do told me  he found Hyde's speech the more thought ful.  In essence, Hyde argues against the ""mili tant secular-separationist perspective"" that  would not only separate church and state as  institutions, but also would exclude ""reli giously based values"" from public life, leav ing a morally sterile politics that the theolo gian Richard  John Neuhaus  calls  ""the  naked public square.""  Hyde is Catholic and proud of it. He is  particularly stern about liberal anti-Catholi cism, of which he has been a particular  object.  The American Civil Liberties Union once  had a private detective follow him to church  in an effort to prove the Hyde Amendment  unconstitutional.  He also rejects the notion that abortion is  ""a Catholic issue, or a Mormon issue, or a  Lutheran issue."" It is ""an ethical issue,"" and  he points out that even in striking down the  abortion laws of all 50 states, the Supreme  Court acknowledged this.  And in upholding the Hyde Amendment  in 1980, the court said emphatically that ""it  does not follow that a statute violates the  Establishment Clause because it happens to  coincide or harmonize with  the  tenets of  some or of all  religions. That the Judeo Christian religious oppose stealing does not  mean that a ... government may not, con sistent with  the  Establishment Clause,  enact law prohibiting larceny.""  Though Hyde has intellectual prowess in  abundance, it is hard to think of the man as  October 12, 1984  a full-fledged intellectual when he has pub licly confessed  that his favorite TV show  used to be Laverne and Shirley.""  In his younger, slimmer days, he also was  a  college basketball star who once held  George Mikan  to  a  single point  in  the  second half.  Born in 1924, Hyde grew up in Chicago, a  loyal Catholic and Democrat. During World  War  II he  served  in  the South Pacific,  where a communist officer fed him propa ganda and unwittingly turned him into an  anti-communist.  He  cast  his  first  vote  for Harry  S.  Truman, but became a Republican in 1956.  A lawyer and father of four, he won his con gressional  seat  in 1974-otherwise a  bad  year for Republicans.  Even liberals find Hyde unhateable. The  Washington Monthly recently named him  one of the six best congressmen, crediting  him with ""an open-mindedness and humor  that can take the raw edges off otherwise  acrimonious debates.""  If being his opponent is a pleasure, being  on his side is a joy.  In this happy season for conservatives, I  remember the radiance he cast  in darker  days.  Nobody has so completely embodied the  politics of love.e  GEOCIDE IN AFGHANISTAN  HON. WM. S. BROOMFIELD  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 11, 1984  e ",1984
1720,766,23,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, a  new holocaust is upon us. Recent re ports  from Afghanistan  reveal  that  the Soviet and Afghani military are  systematically killing Afghani civilians  and destroying the  infrastructure of  that once lovely land. The world must  be  told about  these horrible Soviet  atrocities. I want to share a revealing  article  from  the Christian Science  Monitor  on  this  important  subject  with my colleagues in the Congress.  While all of us often read press ac counts of human rights violations in  various countries around  the world,  the tragedy of Afghanistan often goes  unreported. We all know the sad histo ry of Soviet occupation of that once  free land and of our Government's ef forts  to bring  international pressure  upon the Soviet Union to withdraw.  While the Mujahideen freedom fight ers struggle on against overwhelming  odds to battle the Soviet invaders, the  poor Afghani peasants have become  the new victims of  the Soviet and  Afghani military machine. As refugees  try to leave Afghanistan for the safety  of Pakistan, Soviet airstrikes are  in tentionally directed at  these  fleeing  peasants. Many of them are  leaving  Afghanistan  in  the  aftermath  of  Soviet and Afghani scorched Earth op erations designed to destroy the civil ian  infrastructure.  Farms,  houses,  markets, schools, and hospitals have  been attacked and totally destroyed.  ",1984
1721,779,23,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr. Speaker, we  have heard much recently of libera tion  theology.  There  are  various  shades of  this  theology  throughout  the world, particularly in Latin Amer ica. It is unfortunate that liberation  theology  is allowing some priests or  ex-priests who are avowed Marxist Leninists to be the spokesmen for a  theology which often spoke  for  the  poor and oppressed.  A  recent editorial  in  the Lincoln  Star of September 8, 1984, thoughtful ly analyzed the recent Vatican docu ment which attacked liberation theol ogy. Where Marxism-Leninism  has  been experimented with,  the  result  has been the decimation of individual  liberties. Final authority must  rest  with the people. The def enders of the  individual against government oppres sion-whether that oppression be from  a Communist or a military govern ment-are the truly brave democrats.  Liberation theology must decide where  it stands on these critical issues. I com mend this article to my colleagues.  LIBERATION A DECEIT  The Vatican statement of concern with  liberation theology, now widely practiced by  members of the Roman Catholic clergy in  South America,  is an analysis worth con templation. It has meaning far beyond that  of the church involved.  Liberation theology is based on the works  of Karl Marx, which see class struggle as  the means of human  liberation. But the  Vatican document notes ""that atheism and  the denial of the human person, his liberty  and his rights, are the core of the Marxist  theory. This  theory,  then, contain errors  which directly threaten truths of the faith  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  regarding the eternal destiny of individual  persons ....  ""Millions of our own contemporaries le gitimately yearn to recover those basic free doms of which they were deprived by totali tarian and atheistic regimes which came to  power by violent and revolutionary means,  precisely in the name of liberation of the  people. This shame of our time cannot be ig nored: While claiming  to bring  freedom,  these regimes keep whole nations in condi tions of servitude which are unworthy of  mankind. Those who, perhaps inadvertent ly, make themselves accomplices of similar  enslavements betray the poor they mean to  help.  ""The class struggle as a  road  toward a  classless  society  is  a myth which  slows  reform and aggravates proverty and injus tice. Those who allow  themselves  to be  caught up  in  fascination with  this myth  should reflect on the bitter examples histo ry has to offer about where it leads .... ""  Where it leads can be seen in Cuba, in  Nicaragua,  in Libya,  and  of  course,  in  Russia, the seat of orthodox Marxism.  What the Vatican document speaks to is  the supremacy of the  individual over the  state and  the resulting personal  freedom  thereof. Very clearly, democratic forms of  government are dominantly in accord with  that  theory.  In such governments,  final  power and authority rests with the people,  their will carried out by freely elected repre sentatives.  When Canadian Liberal Prime Minister  John Turner was soundly defeated by his  Conservative Party opponent this week, he  said: ""The people of Canada from coast to  coast have spoken and the people are always  right."" Turner  effectively  presented  the  guiding principle of democracy, whether or  not it always works out quite that way.  These are sobering thoughts for voters of  the United States as they approach Novem ber's national elections and they are sober ing thoughts for our government as it seeks  to build and maintain alliances throughout  the world. Without clear recognition and  understanding of the dignity of the individ ual,  the cause of democracy and human  freedom is not really served.   A DAY OF SORROW AND  IRRECONCILABILITY  HON. ROBERTS. WALKER  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 11, 1984  e ",1984
1722,779,23,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to be able to share with my  colleagues a statement which was re cently  forwarded  to me  by Mr.  Edmund V. Pribitkin, president of the  Congress of Russian-Americans,  Inc.,  and resident of the 16th Congressional  District of Pennsylvania which I have  the privilege of representing. It is es pecially appropriate during this elec tion year to take time to reflect on the  freedoms which Americans enjoy as  citizens of the United States, and to  express our moral support for  those  who still suffer under the harsh, to talitarian rule of Soviet communism.  The October 1984 statement by  the  board of directors of the Congress oi  Russian-Americans follows:  32551  A DAY OF SORROW AND IRRECONCILABILITY,  1984  As we approach November the 7th, the  day when the Soviet Union annually cele brates  international communism's arroga tion of power in Russia, we-Russian-Ameri cans-appeal to the U.S. Government and to  freedom-loving citizens of this country to  designate it as a Day of Sorrow and Irrecon cilability.  Sadly,  albeit  fittingly,  among  all  the  ethnic groups making up the tapestry of  these United States of America, only the  Russian-Americans  persist  in  annually  asking their Government and their fellow  Americans  to observe  this  inglorious day.  Russian-Americans  feel  it  is  their sacred  duty to mark with mourning and defiance  the day international communism claimed  their former countrymen as its first victim.  Thus,  they  honor  their brothers  living  under the Soviet rule.  On this day we express our Sorrow for all  the victims of the communist terror, and  our Irreconcilability with  the  theroy and  practice of communist doctrine.  Moreover, let us not forget that November  7, 1917 marked not only the beginning of  iinmeasurable  sufferings  for  the Russian  and other enslaved people of  the Soviet  Union, but also the beginning of a global  human tragedy which today endangers the  existence of the Free World. Utilizing the  threat of a nuclear war, the Soviets have  gradually taken over key strategic positions  in all parts of the world. Today there hardly  a nation on the face of the earth that has  not been vicitimized by communist aggres sion.  Therefore, we ask the Government of the  United States and all other Free World gov ernments to designate November the 7th as  a Day of Sorrow and Irreconcilability.  Over the past 67 years the Soviet govern ment has spared no effort in trying to strip  the Russian nation of its heritage. Despite  the desecration  and destruction of over  50,000 churches and monasteries, the perse cution and extermination of millions of  people in concentration camps and prisons,  we witness today in the Soviet Union a re vival of faith and awakening of national  pride. The determination of  the Russian  people to live free blazes as never before.  Perhaps the Russian soul, having nurtured  its people through their long, barren winter  of oppression, senses at last spring's hymn  of freedom yearning to be sung. How more  can we honor our brothers than by lending  voices  to this chorus? For by proclaiming  this day of Sorrow and Irreconcilability, we  intone ""Let There Be Light"" and indeed for  all those who hear our voices in their dark ness there is light!e  CENSORSHIP OF FEDERAL EM PLOYEES  BY  THE  ADMINIS TRATION  HON.

1724,792,23,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker, KENT  HANCE can best be described as a com bination of a wise and prudent legisla tor, an entertaining television person ality, and a sage storyteller of great  reknown. He also is one of the ablest  men ever to serve in this House.  Having  served with KENT  on  the  Ways and Means Committee for the  last 6 years, I probably know as well as  anyone how effective KENT has been.  The business and the tax people have  confidence in him, the members of the  committee respect him, and the House  realize he is effective.  Still, even though KENT has been in volved in some of the most controver sial issues before the Congress, he has  never been unpleasant or overbearing.  KENT has never expected a Member to  vote contrary to his conscience or his  district.  I wish it was possible for KENT  to  regale the House, for just a moment,  with some of his stories about Bullet,  Snake, or some of the other hometown  characters he can so graphically de scribe-usually with himself at  the  center of the action in question. I wish  we could get him to recount his expe riences as a district attorney or his ex periences as a professor at Texas Tech  University, his alma mater.  KENT has gained statewide recogni tion in Texas. He and his wife Carol  have made  thousands  of  new  and  strong friends across the State.

EARL HUTTO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  OF FLORIDA  Thursday, October 4, 1984  e ",1984
1725,792,23,Mr. HUTTO.," Mr. Speaker, for vari ous reasons there is considerable tran sience  in  the House of Representa tives. Quite often we are saying goodEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  bye to Members with whom we have  served, and this has a tinge of sadness.  Such is the case as we pay tribute to  two  of our  colleagues  from Texas,  CHICK KAZEN and KENT HANCE.  It has been my good fortune to know  these two fine gentlemen and to count  them as friends. CHICK, of course, is a  senior member of the Armed Services  Committee, on which I serve, and we  have served  together on subcommit tees. He has made his mark during a  20-year career here in the Congress.  My wife, Nancy, and I recently visited  countries in the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization with CHICK and CONNIE  KAzEN. Their dedication in service to  America was exemplified in our con tacts with high-ranking foreign offi cials and, as has been his style, CHICK  was on target in asking the kinds of  questions that needed to be asked. We  wish the Kazen's much joy and happi ness as they leave us.  KENT and CAROL HANCE were among  the first people we met as we came to  Washington together as Members of  the 96th Congress. We have continued  this friendship through these 6 years.  Carol and Nancy have often gotten to gether at lunch to fellowship and dis cuss children, school, church, and all  the things associated with transplant ed families in the capital area. Kent is  a  bright,  capable,  and  energetic  member of this House, and let me say  that he is very fortunate to have such  a  charming and delightful wife  as  Carol. Her Christian commitment and  vibrant personality are a great asset to  KENT. And considering his youth, ex perience, and ambition,  I would say  that the future for the Hance's should  be bright.  May God's richest blessings be with  the Kazen and Hance families. We will  miss you.e  TRIBUTE TO KENT HANCE  HON.

1726,792,23,Mr. LEATH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  several times in the past few days we  have risen to honor those among us  who will soon depart. Today, this ex pression of respect and affection is dif ficult. We don't want to come back in  January and feel the absence of some  of our most effective colleagues. The  departure of KENT HANCE is particular ly hard to accept. Since the day we  came to Congress together in 1979, I  have constantly learned from him. His  service has been marked by compe tence, diligence, intellect, and dedica tion. KENT  does  his homework, he  works hard, and he gets the job done.  Working with KENT HANCE has been  a constant pleasure. No matter how  pressures have mounted, he has never  October 12, 1984  lost the good humor that sustains us  all. It's not easy to be tough, to make  unpleasant decisions, or to explain the  complexities of the important legisla tion that KENT has developed. Yet, he  is the expert's expert and never ap pears to show strain. Every one of us  appreciates his  professionalism, but  even more, we appreciate his kindness  and unfailing courtesy. It is good to  have this opportunity to express how  much we admire him and to wish him  Godspeed as his life takes a new direc tion. KENT, you have been one of our  great resources.

1727,792,23,Mr. SAM B.," HALL, JR. Mr. Speak er, only two men have represented the  19th Congressional District of Texas  in  the House  of Representatives George Mahon  and  KENT  HANCE.  Many of us in this body had the great  privilege  of  serving  with  George  Mahon, and just as we bid him a sad  farewell 6 years ago, we now bid an af fectionate  farewell  to his  successor,  my good friend, KENT HANCE. These  two men have given west Texas  a  strong and effective voice in Congress.  Like George Mahon,  our  colleague  KENT HANCE will be hard to replace.  As a member of the Ways and Means  Committee KENT  HANCE  has  given  Texas a strong and influential voice on  vital issues affecting our area. He has  played a tremendous role in articulat ing energy and water problems, and  his constituents are going to miss that  influence.  People  in my  area  of northeast  Texas  are  particularly  grateful  to  KENT HANCE for the active and effec tive part he has played  in helping  workers at  the Lone Star Steel Co.  whose jobs have been taken away by  low wage, heavily subsidized foreign  steel imports. He has worked closely  with me in taking the message of our  steelworkers to the highest councils of  government,  and  I will  always  be  grateful to him.  On  tax  and  budget  policy KENT  HANCE has been in the forefront of ef forts to utilize the Internal Revenue  Code as a  vehicle  to stimulate  the  economy and provide new jobs. He is a  strong proponent of  free enterprise  and the free marketplace, and his can do,  hard-charging  attitude on vital  economic issues has always made him  a force to be reckoned with.  As we all know, KENT HANCE gave up  a safe House seat in order to run for  the U.S. Senate against overwhelming  odds. He surprised everyone but him",1984
1728,805,23,Mr.  CARR.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay recognition to Ms. Shei lah Denne of Clarkston, MI.  I am speaking on Ms. Denne's behalf  because she is a concerned citizen who  has been working to change a danger ous condition in her community. The  condition I refer to is the traffic situa tion on Dixie Highway and other area  roads. In the first 5 months of this  year alone, there were 59 injuries and  132 property accidents on  the Dixie  Highway. Since January,  there have  been 5 deaths on this road alone, and  20  traffic  fatalities  on  area  roads.  Businesses along  the highway have  suffered  from  the dangerous  traffic  situation discouraging patrons  from  visiting.  Ms. Denne was  the driving  force  behind a petition campaign  that re sulted in 2,000 signatures being deliv ered  to my office from citizens who  shared her concern over  the Dixie  Highway problem. For 4 years, she has  met with disappointment. But she did  not stop trying.  This matter was brought to my at tention early this year, and I began  my efforts to get Federal funds for the  renovation of the Dixie Highway and  other area roads. I introduced legisla tion  to appropriate money  for  that  purpose, and since then, this project  has been through the entire gamut of  legislative meanderings, and caused no  small  amount  of  controversy. The  Dixie project has been in four differ ent bills, been brought up before the  Rules Committee three times, and for  a time was the sole point of controver sy in a major appropriations bill. It  was marked up on June 19 of  this'  year, was reported out of committee  on June 22, and was the subject of nu merous hearings before the Appropria tions  and Rules Committee. Many  were  the discussions on strategy  to  guide this bill through the many legis lative obstacles I encountered.  I  also held  two  town meetings on  how  to remedy the dangerous situa tion on the highway and to let resi dents of the area know what progress  I was making. These meetings were  held at Our Lady of the Lakes Church  in Waterford, MI, on March 30 and  June 11. Several hundred people were  in attendance and let me know their  views and suggestions on what should  be done.  I  took that advice back to  Washington, and furthered my efforts  to make sure that these citizens' inter ests were served.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  But all that is over now, and I am  proud  to  stand here and announce  that there is now $12 million in Feder al money earmarked in the continuing  resolution passed by the Congress last  night  for  improvements  on Dixie  Highway and other area roads. This  has been the only highway project to  pass the 98th Congress, and I am glad  to have been a part of it.  Construction will take place in sever al stages over the next few years, and  what are now fearful stretches of road  will  be  smooth-running,  important  avenues for the area.  There are many people who helped  along the way. Senator CARL LEVIN, in  particular, was helpful at a  critical  juncture in the Senate. But ultimately  the biggest ""Thanks"" goes  to Sheila  Denne. The community owes a debt of  gratitude to Sheila for caring enough  to get involved, and for not giving up  during the 4 years of discouragement  and the long, but successful, legislative  struggle.  I would  like  to  thank Ms.  Denne for helping to bring the matter  to my attention so that I could become  involved, and I want to commend her  as well. She has had the courage and  tenacity to continue fighting, and will  now see her ideas become concrete re ality .e  STATE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMS  SALVADOR HAS NAPALM  HON. EDWARD J.

1729,805,23,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  recent confirmation by the State De partment that the Salvadoran Armed  Forces have acquired stocks of napalm  munitions  is  deeply  disturbing;  64  Members of Congress recently joined  me in a letter to President Reagan ex pressing our concerns about the acqui sition and possible use of napalm in El  Salvador. I commend this letter to my  colleagues  insert  it  to be printed  in  full at this point in the RECORD.  CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES,  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, DC, October 4, 1984.  Hon. RONALD REAGAN,  The White House, Washington, DC.  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Recently,  the U.S.  Ambassador to El Salvador confirmed that  the Salvadoran military possesses napalm  weapons. In addition,  there have been re ports that napalm has been used against ci vilians in El Salvador.  We are deeply disturbed by the possibility  of the use of napalm in El Salvador. El Sal vador is a densely populated nation under going a civil war in which civilians are often  difficult  to distinguish  from  combatants,  particularly from the air. The use of incen diary devices such as napalm in this conflict  can be expected to cause cruel injury to in nocent civilians. The United States should  not be associated with such a morally repug nant prospect.  32577  No benefit  the Salvadoran government  could anticipate from using napalm would  outweigh  the human  suffering,  domestic  outrage  and  international  opprobrium  which would accompany this act. Further more, a government which uses or contem plates using napalm against its own people  stands  little chance of maintaining  their  support.  The United States should oppose the use  or  acquisition of napalm by Salvadoran  Armed Forces.  Several questions require prompt answers.  Was United States assistance used in the ac quisition of napalm by El Salvador? Do Sal vadoran Armed Forces contemplate using  U.S.-supplied aircraft or equipment to deliv er napalm? Has napalm been used by the  Salvadoran Armed Forces to eschew the use  of napalm and to do away with their stocks  of napalm?  Your attention to this matter is deeply ap preciated.

1732,818,23,Mr. ERLENBORN.," Mr. Speaker, I  have been advised that Ralph Nader  has accused  the Reagan administra tion of having a  secret plan  to cut  black lung benefits after the election.  This charge is utterly ludicrous on  its face. Nader knows that the Presi dent car.not reduce such benefits with out the enactment of legislation. No  one,  and  especially  not  President  Reagan, has ever suggested reducing  the benefits  that black  lung victims  are now receiving.  The obvious purpose of the Nader  charge  is  to play upon  the fears of  these benefit  recipients. Such  false  charges,  like  those of alleged secret  plans to reduce Social Security bene fits, are a cynical misuse of the fears  of people.  Ralph Nader styles himself as  the  protector of consumers' interests. If he  were truly concerned about taxpayers  and consumers and not merely bent on  scaring the elderly and disabled for po litical  purposes,  he would  be  con cerned about the abuses now existing  in the Black Lung Program. This com pensation  scheme,  passed with  the  promise that it would never cost more  than $50 million per year, now costs  taxpayers and consumers well over $2  billion per year. Such a cost overrun of  more  than 4,000 percent makes  the  Pentagon excesses pale into insignifi cance.  Nader should be concerned that the  GAO,  an  independent arm of Con gress, has studied  this compensation  scheme and concluded that less than  13 percent of those receiving benefits  have medical proof of disability due to  black lung or even have the disease.  The excesses of this program are fi nanced by consumers who are paying  through higher costs of electricity and  October 12, 1984  other consumer goods  produced  by  coal energy and by the taxpayers gen erally.  The responsible course, in the inter est of consumer, taxpayer, and victim  alike, would be to reform black lung  benefits so  that  in  the  future only  actual victims be qualified for benefits.  Such a revised benefit program would  rightly warrant  continued  support  without gouging  taxpayers and con sumers.  Nader's vicious and cynical attack  should qualify him for the ""Sleaze of  the Year Award.""   TRIBUTE TO WILLARD A.  MORRIS  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OF MARYLAND  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 1984   ",1984
1733,818,23,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  give  tribute  to one of  the State of  Maryland's most enduring and profes sional public servants upon  the up coming occasion of his retirement. In  just a  few  short weeks, Willard A.  Morris will step down as State admin istrator of election laws, completing a  dedicated career of over 30 years  in  service to the citizens of Maryland.  Ironically, or perhaps, predictably,  Willard Morris became  interested  in  politics through the inspiration of Col.  E. Brooke Lee. You will  recall, Mr.  Speaker, that Colonel Lee, a legend in  Montgomery County, MD, died just a  short time ago at the age of 92. I know  that Willard Morris felt the loss very  acutely as did so many of us in this  area.  Willard Morris was first elected  to  the Montgomery County Democratic  Central Committee in 1954,  living in  Silver Spring, MD, at the time. In 1955  Gov. Theordore McKeldin appointed  him  to  the Washington Surburban  Sanitary Commission where he served  until 1963 the last 3 years as its vice  chairman. It was in 1963 that Gover nor Tawes appointed Willard as major ity clerk to the Montgomery County  Board of Supervisors of Elections. And  it was in the elections discipline that  he continued to serve for the rest of  his career, being appointed by Gov.  Marvin Mandel as the first State ad ministrator of election laws, reappoint ed  in 1975 and reappointed again  in  1981. He is the cof ounder of the Mary land Association of Election Officials  and served on the legislative council  subcommittee  to  revise  the Election  Code and Fair Electio Practices Act  which was adopted in 1967-68. It was  the first time the election code applied  uniformly  throughout  the state and  he, as I indicated, was asked to become  the first administrator of that law.  Mr. Speaker, Willard Morris has con ducted himself in a very difficult and  ",1984
1734,831,23,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Speaker,  the  Comprehensive Crime Control Act of  1984 is part of Public Law 98-473, the  continuing  appropriation  for  fiscal  year 1985. Legislation  implementing  the Convention for the Suppression of  Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of  Civil Aviation  is  in turn part of the  Comprehensive Crime Control Act.  That Convention, commonly known as  the Montreal Convention, was ratified  by the United States in 1972. For the  United States to fulfill its obligations  under the Convention, it must enact  implementing  legislation  that estab lishes its jurisdiction over certain of fenses  affecting  the  safety of  civil  aviation. The implementing legislation  makes both substantive and technical  changes in Federal law, which already  makes criminal, or provides civil penal ties for, acts that endanger the safety  of civil aviation. The  legislation ex pands this protection to make U.S. law  consistent with  the  requirements of  the Montreal  Convention.  also  makes certain other related changes in  current law, described below.  The implementing legislation is part  of a package of antiterrorism legisla tion proposed by the administration.  In  light of  the  increase  in  terrorist  acts both  in and outside  the United  States, it was incumbent on the United  States to speedily enact such legisla tion.  The essence of the legislation is its  amendment, in section 2013(b) of the  bill, of section 32 of  title 18 of the  United States Code. That section al ready makes criminal certain acts of  destruction of aircraft and aircraft fa cilities. The purpose of  the amend ment  is  the  same: Those acts  that  cause destruction of aircraft and relat ed facilities and parts, and thus endan ger  the safety of  that aircraft, are  made criminal. New section 32 carries  forward current  law and, consistent  with the requirements of the Conven tion, somewhat expands the kinds of  acts  it covers and  the  jurisdictional  scope of section 32.  Thus,  the state of mind necessary  for conviction of an individual under  section 32 remains the same. The de fendant must perform the prohibited  acts ""willfully."" The proposed amend ment makes no  change  in current  law's interpretation of this term.  ""An act is done 'willfully' if it is done vol untarily and  intentionally        with  the  bad purpose  to disobey or disregard  the  law."" E. Devitt & C. Blackmar, Federal Jury  Practice and  Instructions  1970>. See generally An analysis of the Tenn  ""Willful"" in Federal Criminal Statutes, 51  § 16.13 <2d  ed.  NOTRE DAME LAW. 786 0976).  New  section  32<a)0) makes  clear  that jurisdiction over acts relating to  the destruction of aircraft or aircraft  facilities extends  to ""any aircraft in  the special aircraft jurisdiction of the  United States."" Consistent with the re quirements of the Convention, this ex pands the reach of section 32 beyond  the current law's jurisdictional base:  ""any civil aircraft used, operated, or  employed  in  interstate, overseas, or  foreign air commerce."" ""Special air craft jurisdiction of the United States""  is defined in section 101<38)(d) of the  Federal Aviation Act  of  1958  (49  u.s.c. 1301<38)(d)).  It is implicit in the kind of conduct  prohibited by paragraph  (}) of both  current law and new section 32  that  such acts are likely  to endanger the  safety of the aircraft. Thus, following  the practice of current law, new sec tion 32(a)(l) does not state  this  re quirement  explicitly. However,  the  acts described  in paragraph < 1) can  have no other result.  Because the acts prohibited by pro posed  section  32,  paragraphs  (2)  through (6), might have other results,  it is necessary to state explicitly that  these paragraphs criminalize only that  conduct that threatens the safety of  the aircraft. Thus, paragraphs (2), (3),  and (5) prohibit certain conduct that  is ""likely to endanger the safety of any  such aircraft."" Paragraph (4) requires  that  the  defendant  act  ""with  the  intent to damage, destroy, or disable""  such aircraft. Paragraph (6), relating  to the communications of false infor mation, requires that the communica tion actually endanger  the aircraft's  safety.  The  description  of  conduct  pro scribed by  section 32  has,  in  some  cases, been somewhat consolidated for  the sake of clarity and brevity. But, as  stated above, the kind of conduct cov ered-that which will  threaten  the  safety  of  the  aircraft-has  not  changed. For example, while inclusion  of ordinary interference with the oper ation  of  an  air  navigation  facility  might be interpreted to prohibit work  stoppages by unionized airlines em ployees, new paragraph < 3) covers only  ""interference by  force or violence.""  The former type of conduct would not  endanger  the safety of  the aircraft,  while the latter would.  There are three significant additions  to the type of conduct prohibited by  current section 32. First, paragraph (5)  of section 32 criminalizes the willful  incapacitation of any crewmember of  an aircraft. Paragraph (5) of new sec tion 32 extends this coverage to acts of  violence against or  incapacitation of  any individual on board the aircraft.  Thus, both passengers and crew are  protected.  Second, new paragraph (6) prohibits  the communication of false  inf orma tion if the communication endangers  the safety of the aircraft. The def end ant must know that the information is  false. Consistent with current law, the  communication must take place under  circumstances which would lead area sonable person to believe it. Cf. Watts  394 U.S. 705,  707  v. United States,  0969); United States v. Portillo, 431  F.2d 293 (4th Cir. 1970), aff'd en bane,  438 F.2d 13 0971 ). The resources of  the Federal Government should not  be expended on prosecuting  individ uals who communicate false informa tion if no one believes the information  and, therefore, no one acts on it.  Third, new paragraph (6) of section  32 prohibits attempts to do any of the  acts  proscribed  by  paragraphs  ( 1)  through (6). Current law does not pro scribe attempts.  Of course,  complicities  to commit  any act proscribed by section 32 are  prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 2.  Consistent with  the seriousness of  the conduct prohibited by new section  32, the penalty for a violation of that  section is $100,000, 20 years in prison,  or both. Current law authorizes the  imposition of the same term of impris onment, but  the authorized  fine  is  only $10,000.  Subsection (b) of new section 32 im plements article 5 of the Convention,  which requires each party to establish  its jurisdiction over certain offenses when the aircraft on board which the of fense  is committed  lands  in  its  territory  with the alleged offender still on board,  And where thealleged offender is present in its territory  and it does not extraditeThe alleged off ender. It extends the  section's coverage to acts of violence  or of destruction ofcivil aircraft registered in a country other  than the United States       if the offender  is later found in the United States.  Ordinarily, the United States is re luctant  to  exercise  its  jurisdiction  when all of  the conduct comprising  the offense was committed in another  country, and  the defendant entered  the United States at a  later point in  time.  In this case, however,  the au thorization of extraterritorial jurisdic tion is appropriate because of the seri ous nature of the proscribed conduct  and because the exercise of such juris diction is recognized under principles  of international law. The universality  principle of international law permits  the exercise of jurisdiction in this in stance. Application of the universality  principle depends on which nation has  custody of the individual. The univer sality principle is generally accepted in  the case of internationally recognized  crimes. NoteExtraterritorial  Jurisdiction-Criminal  Law, 13 HARV. INT. L.J. 346-47, n. 1 0972).  ",1984
