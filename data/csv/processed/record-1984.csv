0,Senate,98,0.087,15,1,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. President, for  39 years, Dr. Anthony Zukowsky has  worked for the freedom of the Ukrain ian people.  am very sorry to learn  that Dr. Zukowsky has  suffered  a  heart attack and remains  in critical  condition. His great efforts over the  years cannot be adequately acknowl edged or replaced, and his knowledge  of and determination for the Ukraini an cause  remain unparalleled.  It is  with Dr. Zukowsky's diligent efforts in  mind that I  read this letter from the  North Dakota branch of the Ukraini an Congress Committee of America,  Inc.  DEAR SENATOR ANDREWs. Yesterday,  the  Ukrainian people in the free world celebrat ed the 66th anniversary of the Proclamation  of Independence of Ukraine. It was on Janu ary 22,  1918,  that  this proclamation was  made in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine.  Following this declaration, the sovereign  of Ukraine struggled for 3 years against the  Russian Bolsheviks. They succumbed to the  aggressor who  established  in Ukraine  a  Communist  government  known  as  the  Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  Under  the Communist rule, millions of  Ukrainians have been annihilated. In 1983,  the Ukrainians in the free world called at tention to the 50th anniversary of the man made famine which caused the death of 7  mlll1on Ukrainians. Further, the churches  in Ukraine have been destroyed, the clergy  and  faithful  persecuted. All  aspects  of  Ukrainian life are controlled and directed  by Moscow.  Arrests, trials, convictions of thousands of  Ukrainians charged with ""anti-Soviet propa ganda  and  agitation""  have  been made.  Unfair trials and harsh sentences have been  given to members of the Ukrainian Helsinki  Accord monitoring groups. Extended prison  terms are now being given to dissident writ ers.  ",1984
1,Senate,98,0.322,41,1,Mr. DOLE.," Madam President, I am  not certain what the bypass problem  may turn out to be. But there appears  to be at least some concern expressed  by a number of people that we visited  with. So there were 32 of us who sent  a  letter to  the Federal Communica tions Commission. I have asked that a  copy of that letter be printed in the  RECORD.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of the temporary order of the Federal  Communications Commission  appear  in the RECORD. They will make, as I  understand  it,  a  final  order  on  Wednesday of this week.  There being no objection, the order  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  REcoRD, as follows:  [Report No. 17831, Action in Docket Case,  Jan.19, 19841  FCC DELAYS $2 CHARGE  <CC Docket 78-72, Phase I>  The Commission decided to delay end user  access charges for residential and single line  business customers in light of requests from  citizens and public officials that such end  user charges be delayed for further study.  The Commission also concluded that a delay  is necessary  to enable the Commission to  devise an exemption for end users who may  not be able to afford any end user charge,  and to allow a Federal/State Joint Board  more time to evaluate proposals to provide  more assistance to customers of small tele phone companies.  The Commission will issue a Supplemen tal Notice In the near future Inviting comments on the exemption question and how  best to implement an end user charge plan  for all residential and single line business  customers. The Commission said  that  its  view at this time was there should be a more  gradual  transition stretching to 1990 and  that  the charge  to  customers would be  capped at $4.00 during this transition. This  would result in a sharing of cost burdens by  the telephone customers and the telephone  carriers. The Commission  intends  to  take  comments regarding now best to implement  this proposall, and at the same time to rig orously study all possible effects of the pro posals upon the universality of telephone  service. In addition, the agency will contin ue  to  investigate  the effects on universal  service of federal decisions in general.  The Commission  also  said  that  it  re mained convinced that bypass of the public  telecommunications network by large users  poses a  significant and present threat  to  universal service, and that it intended to use  the additional time provided by the djlay of  the end user charge proposal  to compile  more detailed information upon the extent  and dangers of bypass. The Commission di rected its staff to strive to complete the fur ther proceedings ordered by December 1,  1984 so that it would be possible for any  new plan and tariff arrangements to be put  in place by June 1985.  Regarding small telephone companies, the  Commission said  that it  intends  to meet  their need for more assistance than their  large counterparts because  they generally  have a smaller base of business subscribers  and less flexibility in recovering above aver age costs without adverse effects on residen tial subscribers. Thus, the Commission di rected the staff to prepare Notices to gather  comments on methods to provide even more  financial assistance to small telephone com panies. Among the options under consider ation at this time include: < 1 > giving smaller  telephone companies latitude to collect end  user charges or not; or <2> increasing assist ance for  local exhange carriers with  less  than 50,000 loops in a study area to cover 80  percent of loop costs between 110 percent  and 200 percent of the national average.  The Commission recognized that delay of  the end user charge would require that the  revenue  requirement  for  the  Carrier  Common Line access element be increased  to compensate for the loss of revenues that  would have been  received  from end user  charges paid by residential and single line  business customers. No change was made in  the charges for multi-line business custom ers.  The Commission also decided to revise the  rules for the computation of access charges  to be paid by carriers that provide alterna tives to AT&T's long distance services, such  as MCI's Execunet  service  and GTE's  SPRINT service. The agency was convinced  by arguments made by NTIA, the Depart ment of Justice, and several carriers, that  the existing plan could have undesirable  competitive  consequences  and  that  care  should be taken to ensure the maintenance  of  competition  through  the  transition  period leading up to the time when all inter state carriers could be provided interconnec tion to local exchanges comparable to that  enjoyed by AT&T. Therefore, the Commis sion prescribed two  levels of charges, one  for ""equal"" access to a switch comparable to  that provided AT&T and one for ""unequal""  access comparable to that presently afford ed to most of AT&T's competitors. All long  distance carriers will pay the same rate for  equal access. A  total differential of 55% was  ",1984
2,House,98,0.691,80,1,Mr. DANNEMEYER.," Mr. Speaker, I  raise a question of the privileges of the  House, and I offer a privileged resolu tion <H. Res. 390) and ask for its im mediate consideration.  The Clerk read the resolution, as fol lows:  H. REs. 390  Resolved, That effective 30 days after the  adoption of this resolution, each Standing  and Select Committee of the House, except  for the Committee on Standards of Official  Conduct,  shall be constituted  in a  ratio  which is proportionate to the membership  of the two political parties in the House as a  whole; and each subcommittee thereof shall  also be so constituted; and insofar as practi cable,  the staffs of each Committee shall  also reflect these same ratios.  The  SPEAKER.  The  gentleman  from California has been kind enough  to advise the Chair that he was going  to offer this resolution as a question of  privilege at the appropriate time, and  now is the appropriate time.  Would the gentleman state why he  feels the resolution constitutes a ques tion of privilege?  ",1984

5,House,98,0.377,93,1,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, I just  want to make the point for the Mem bers of  the majority party, because  they do not seem to fully understand  what we  are  trying  to  accomplish,  that, contrary to the earlier statement  of the distinguished gentleman from  Wisconsin, your party controls  this  floor every day all day during the ses sion. You control the time. As your  Speaker has told us, you control the  calendar. You have virtual dictator ship.  One of the few rules we have that  gives us a chance to say our piece is to  talk during special orders, one of the  few times we have control of the floor.  And,  in  fact,  last  fall, your deputy  whip systematically took time in order  to be able to take the time when he  wanted  it. So  that from our stand point, as the minority, having watched  through the latter part of last year  when a number of people,  including  some who are in this Chamber right  this moment, attempted to ram things  through this House on your schedule,  according to your rules, the way you  wanted to do it, we are simply trying  to follow the same rules.  We offered a  legitimate request. It  was,  as  the gentleman pointed out,  perfectly legitimate for him to object.  However, by so doing, he sets the tone.  And I sincerely hope that my friend,  the gentleman from Pennsylvania, will  object to this particular request.  ",1984

7,House,98,0.497,93,1,Mr. LUNGREN.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  think it is rather ironic that we had a  spokesman for the other side of the  aisle tell us that this would prohibit  the Democrats  from  speaking until  after the Members on this side of the  aisle have spoken.  If anyone has noted the 1 minute  session, they will note that the Speak er of the House always allows all of  the Democrats who  are  seated  to  speak at the same time as the Republi cans, and in many cases allows those  Democrats, who come down long after  we have been waiting for perhaps as  much as an hour, to speak before we  are allowed to speak.  Now, maybe they think that is insig nificant. Perhaps it is. But it is also  just as  insignificant  that  this will  allow a number of Republicans,  the  minority party,  to speak before  the  majority party, which controls  this  place, has their opportunity to speak  as well.  We were denied on four specific oc casions today the opportunity to bring  to  the  floor  specific  constitutional  amendments that are very controver sial  in many  respects but certainly  cannot be discounted as being insignif icant. We went that route because we  have been denied on a regular basis in  this House the opportunity to bring  those  things  before  the  people's  House,  the Representatives  of  the  people.  Second, the gentleman from Califor nia <Mr. DANNEMEYER)  pointed out  today how unfair the committee ratio  is. It is unfair in terms of those people  who are allowed to vote and in terms  of those staff people that we have, and  so we are denied the opportunity to  have equal access to debate in commit tees, just as we are on the floor.  Now there is an attempt to deny us  an opportunity to have time that we  control for some sustained period of  time. It seems  to be OK when  the  leadership of the Democratic side de cides to do that. The gentleman from  Texas <Mr. GONZALEZ) has taken time  for more than 1 day on other occa sions. There have been other Members  who have made multiple requests on  other  times. But because  somehow  this will give the minority a legitimate  opportunity to debate legitimate issues  in a  very, very political year  that  might upset the effort of the Demo cratic Congressional Committee  to  have what they want in what is quoted  in today's Washington Post a dull po litical year, that somehow the oppor tunity  for  individual Members who  represent constituencies who happen  to be in the minority party will not be  allowed that opportunity.  It seems to me that we have made a  legitimate request. If in fact the other  side is going to insist on objecting to  such legitimate requests, we have no  recourse but to use the only protection  any minority has  in any  legislative  body, and that is to use the rules. And  we will do so.  ",1984

9,House,98,-0.402,106,1,Mr. COLEMAN of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  the motion offered by Mr. WALKER of  Pennsylvania to bring a constitutional  amendment on school prayer directly  to the floor of the House, bypassing  the committee process and  limiting  debate on this important  issue  to a  mere 1 hour.  This motion would create a  terrible  precedent for considering any change  to the basic principles of the Republic.  Every constitutional amendment we  have ever had has been preceded by  extensive hearings where opponents  and  supporters  can have  sufficient  time to present their case and allow  Members of Congress  to weigh  the  facts  of  the  issue  based on  their  merits. Allowing 1 hour of debate that means total time of debate, be cause there would have been no hear ings, no  testimony, no witnesses, no  chance to invoke the basic American  ideals of a  fair hearing for everyone,  regardless of  their views-would not  permit this process to take place. The  legislative process would  be  turned  into a  railroad, and the House would  end up spending far less of its time on  a change in the U.S. Constitution than  it would on a routine bill.  I also object to the use of clearly im proper procedural tactics to force al leged votes on an issue. We will soon  be subject  to, no doubt, a  flurry of  press  releases  denouncing  a  ""vote  against school prayer,"" when in fact  Mr. WALKER and others know as well  as I do that it has nothing to do at all  with the supposed issue at hand. The  issue at stake  is the preservation of  the integrity of the process by which  we amend our basic principles. Surely  the supporters of school prayer de serve better than this, because efforts  to erode the constitutional process, no  matter how worthy the issue on whose  behalf the erosion would take place,  serve no legitimate end.e  THE FAIRNESS ISSUE AND THE  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  ",1984
10,,98,-0.171,132,1,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would  like to insert my Washington  report for Wednesday, December 21,  1983, into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:  FooD SAFETY  To my surprise, the issue of food safety  comes up frequently in public meetings even  though the media pay relatively scant at tention to it. This is understandable, I sup pose, because food safety is something that  touches our lives daily.  My first comment is nothing more than a  simple observation:  the American people  today enjoy the world's best and safest food  supply. We all have a strong interest in en suring that these high standards are main tained. The productivity of our farmers and  the effectiveness of our food processing and  distribution system are primarily responsi ble  for  the wide variety of high-quality  foods available in our supermarkets. Con gress and federal regulatory agencies, such  as  the  Food  and Drug Administration  <FDA>. have also played a key role through  legislation to help create an ample, nutri tious food supply with the greatest benefit  and lowest risk to consumers.  Simple though the issue may seem <""Is  the food safe, or isn't it?""), food safety is  one of the most complex on the national  agenda. At one time or another, Americans  have worried about food-borne diseases such  as botulism, the toxic substances sometimes  present in natural foods, the chemical con taminants in meat and fish, and the resi dues of pesticides in fruits and vegetables. It  is my  impression, however,  that Hoosiers  are most concerned about the effects of arti ficial additives introduced into foods to pre serve or color them. It is easy to see why  this concern is so intense. In some cases,  laboratory experiments have shown a link  between ingestion of additives and the inci dence of cancer in test animals.  Since 1958, the FDA has been required by  Section 409 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act, the so-called ""Delaney Clause,"" to ban  the use of any additive ""if it is found to  induce cancer when  ingested by man or  animal."" Over the years, the Delaney Clause  has been interpreted to mean that an addi tive can be used only if there is a reasonable  certainty that it will not be harmful. While  most of us support the idea of strict en forcement of laws designed to keep carcino gens out of our food supply, enforcement of  the Delaney Clause  in  recent years has  become controversial. In 1977, the FDA de termined  that  saccharin  caused  bladder  cancer in laboratory test animals and direct ed its removal from the market, but public  demand for continued availability of saccha rin led Congress to exempt it from the pro hibitions of the Delaney Clause.  In another case,  the FDA made certain  laboratory studies and concluded that ni trite, a chemical preservative used in proc essed meats such as frankfurters and bacon,  caused cancer in test animals. Under the De laney Clause, the FDA would have been re quired to ban the use of nitrite, thus calling  into question the continued availability of a  critical component of  the nation's meat  supply. Ultimately,  the  results of other  studies did not support a finding that nitrite  ",1984
11,,98,-0.265,158,1,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, on Jan uary 27 at the annual dinner of the  Laurel Arts, Mrs. Dorothy Dressler  will be presented with the Governor's  Hazlett Memorial Award  for  excel lence in the arts in the field of Service  to the Arts in the State of Pennsylva nia.  I certainly add my congratulations  to this very deserved award. With a  distinguished record of service to the  arts,  it particularly should be noted  that Mrs. Dressler donated the house  and grounds for Laurel Arts' Philip  Dressler Center for the Arts in Somer set, Pa., which is Pennsylvania's only  professionally  staffed  rural  arts  center.  One of the achievements Congress  has made in working with the Nation al Endowment for the Arts is to make  the Federal Government more con scious of  the very special needs of  rural arts projects, and the very strong  impact which arts can have  in  the  rural areas. For too long, the Nation  thought of a strong arts program as  something contained only in the major  urban areas, but  through  the hard  work of many people in our area, we  have been one of the communities to  prove that arts can be distinguished in  rural areas and make a definite com munity contribution.  the Government  in the direction of  rural arts, the very clear fact is that  While I am proud of helping to move  ",1984

15,Senate,98,-0.313,210,1,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, today  I am introducing legislation to address  the growing problem of parents who  fail to make court-ordered child sup port payments.  When parents bring children  into  the world, they have a responsibility  to care for that child. Too often, non custodial parents do not fulfill that re sponsibility. It has become a national  disgrace.  This  legislation, which  is  cospon sored  by  Senators  DURENBERGER,  GRASSLEY, PACKWOOD, MOYNIHAN, LAU TENBERG,  MELCHER,  HOLLINGS,  HAT FIELD, and BOSCHWITZ,  is a bipartisan  effort to assure the payment of child  support  through mandatory  income  withholding,  incentive  payments  to  States, and other improvements in the  child support enforcement program.  We cannot act soon enough. In the  past years,  the number of children  living in single parent families has in creased dramatically.  In 1980  there  were more than 8 million families with  minor children headed by one parent.  Both parents should be responsible for  giving  their  children  food,  shelter,  health care, and an education.  Too often, one parent is not doing  his or her share to provide support. In  1978 about 7 million women were rais ing ~hildren under the age of 21 in a  household where  the  children's fa thers were not present. Fully 40 per cent of  those mothers  received no  child support awards. Of the 60 per cent -who were entitled to child sup port, 28 percent never got the mo~ey,  and 23 percent consistently received  less than the amount awarded by the  court. This legislation is designed  to  confront the problem of child support  enforcement and to begin solving it.  The bill mandates that States must  enact laws requiring the use of speci fied procedures  in  the operation of  their child support enforcement and  paternity  establishment  programs.  The major required procedures are as  follows:  First, mandatory wage withholding  if child support payments are delin quent in an amount equal to 1 month's  support.  Second, new  administrative proce dures assure that States will make all  reasonable efforts to improve the en forcement of child support obligations.  Third, the withholding of State tax  refunds payable  to a parent of an  AFDC child,  if  the parent  is delin quent in support payments.  Fourth,  requiring  individuals who  have demonstrated a pattern of delin quent payments to post a bond, or give  some other guarantee to secure pay ment of past-due support.  In addition,  the bill  replaces  the  present  incentive  formula which  re wards States for collections made on  behalf of AFDC families with a new  formula which rewards States for col lections made on behalf of both AFDC  and non-AFDC families. The Federal  incentive payment  increases  as  the  State's ratio of collections to adminis trative costs improves. Finally, the bill  authorizes $15 million a year for dem onstration grants  to States  to  test  methods of improving interstate col lections.  In New Jersey some steps have been  taken  to  improve  the collections of  child support. The State runs a solid,  cost-efficient program. And we have  an outstanding child support enforce ment program in Essex County begun  by County Executive Peter Shapiro  more than 2 years ago. We need simi lar  initiatives  extended  to  every  county and every State in this Nation.  The bill that Senator DURENBERGER  and I are introducing today is identical  to  legislation championed by Repre sentative MARGE  RouKEMA  in  the  House. That legislation passed unani mously and I look forward to the same  action in the Senate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the bill be printed in the  RECORD.

16,Senate,98,-0.224,223,1,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, if inva sions are de facto declarations of war,  then Cuba  is at war with us. Once  before, Cuba unleashed an unprece dented invasion by unarmed ""boat-sol diers,"" the Marielito convicts. Now, it  is invasion by chemicals, chemical war fare by drug pushing and drug traf ticking.  Two years ago, I expressed my con cern to the Senate about the many al legations surfacing with regard to con siderable and pervasive involvement of  Cuba in drug dealing and drug smug gling. At that time, I asked the Perma nent Subcommittee on  Investigation  for a further inquiry into these allega tions. The subcommittee immediately  responded  and  launched  an  all-out  effort. However, it honored a Drug En forcement Administration  request  to  hold off hearings since the DEA was  in the middle of intensive  investiga tions. These culminated in grand jury  indictments of  four Cuban officials.  The subcommittee agreed not to do  anything which would be detrimental  to DEA's project. Since  the  indict ments, however, there have been sev eral congressional hearings by other  subcommittees which have substanti ated  the active participation of  the  Cuban Government in organized drug  smuggling activities. I believe the evi dence now in hand discloses shocking  acts and continuing criminal behavior  on the part of a government, and I  strongly believe that this matter must  be brought before  the  international  community. It is important that Con gress urge the President to bring to  the attention of the world the repre hensible criminality of Cuban involve ment in drug trafficking.  Aside from the Federal grand jury  indictment of four Cuban officials on  charges of conspiring to smuggle drugs  into the United States, there has been  testimony at hearings alleging concert ed efforts by the Government of Cuba  to facilitate  the flow of illicit drugs  into the United States and into other  countries. Cuban agents have testified  to the intentional involvement by the  highest ranking officials of the Gov ernment of Cuba in illicit drug dealing  and  other witnesses  have  testified  about alleged Government-sponsored  cultivation of poppy fields in Cuba for  the production of opium and about  laboratories  in Cuba  authorized  to  process brown heroin which finds its  way to the United States via Mexico.  The State Department  confirmed  some  time ago  that Cuba  is giving  sanctuary to drug smuggling ships for  refueling and maintenance. Cuba is al lowing mother ships, laden with illegal  drugs from Latin America, to operate  within Cuban waters while unloading  onto smaller vessels for drug runs into  Florida. In return,  the drug dealers  are transporting arms and money to  aid guerrilla operations within  the  hemisphere. In the thrust of one oper ation, Castro is able to strike viciously  at U.S. society by aiding the drug traf fickers to spread their poison and, in  turn, use the smugglers to help arm  and fund  terrorism. I do not doubt,  either, that Cuba is pocketing a sub stantial amount of profits from protec tion fees assessed the traffickers.  Whether Cuba  is directly pushing  drugs or merely allowing, aiding, or  protecting drug smugglers within  its  territory, Cuba has violated an estab lished principle of international law.  This basic principle is that no country  has the right to use or permit the use  of its territory in such a manner as to  injure  another  country  or  persons  therein. More to the point and less es oteric in argument, is Cuba's violation  of  two conventions  to which  it has  agreed. Cuba is a party to the Single  Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the  Convention  on  Psychotropic  Sub stances, both of which Cuba flouts by  its drug activities.  It is for these reasons that I am sub mitting concurrent resolutions calling  for the President to bring before the  United Nations and Organization of  American States the issue of Cuban in volvement in drug trafficking.

17,House,98,-0.321,249,1,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, I  regret to inform my colleagues in the  House of Representatives of the loss  of one of my congressional staff mem bers. Francine Susan Freedman was a  professional  congressional  legislative  aide since 1974 and a member of my  Washington staff since last year. She  was 32 years old when she died on Jan uary 18, 1984, following a brief illness.  Francine will be greatly missed by  her many friends and her loving par ents, Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Freedman  of Chevy Chase,  and her brother,  Steven of Arlington.  Francine was born and  raised  in  Washington. She graduated from Be thesda-Chevy Chase High School and  the University of Maryland, where she  majored in political science. Francine  was a dedicated congressional employ ee. Through her various duties and re sponsibilities  in  my  congressional  office she put the theory into action  that one person can indeed make a dif ference. Every day she put forth her  best efforts to see that the needs of  the people of New Mexico's Third  Congressional District were being met  by a compassionate Federal Govern ment.  Francine was also a past president of  the Habirah chapter of B'nai B'rith  and was  active  in  the Capitol Hill  group of the United Jewish Appeal.  Her strong interest in the affairs of  Israel carried over into her work. She  was  particularly  active  in  helping  Soviet Jews emigrate and she served as  a  highly  valuable  resource  person  dealing with the current state of af fairs in the Middle East. She worked  long hours aiding constituents in cut ting through bureaucratic redtape and  kept a close watch over our operations  in New Mexico to insure that Govern ment was responsive to the taxpayers.  We consider ourselves fortunate to  have known her and to have had her  as our friend.  We will always treasure our relation ship with her and we will remember  her with special affection in the years  to come.  Our sorrow is tempered only by our  fond memories of her bright spirit and  her dedication to helping others. She  leaves a  legacy that all of us should  hope to emulate.  To her parents and to her family, we  extend our heartfelt and our deepest  sympathies.  TWENTY-FOUR HOUR VOTING ITS TIME HAS COME  <Mr. BlAGG! asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)  ",1984
18,House,98,-0.339,249,1,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, Our Na tion's current election process is fail ing us miserably. The 1980 U.S. voter  turnout rate of 52.6 percent was the  lowest for a Presidential election since  1948. Further, voter participation in  our country is more than 30 percent age points lower than the average for  other Western democracies. These are  alarming facts, particularly as we ap proach the November elections.  Today, I am introducing a bill to im prove this bleak situation by providing  for ""same time"" 24-hour voting. The  polling  places  across  the  country  would open on a Sunday at 3 p.m.,  eastern standard time, and would close  24 hours later. These changes would  apply for a 6-year experimental period  beginning with the 1984 Presidential  election.  Under our current system, 80 per cent of  the normal 13-hour voting  period falls during the time our Na tion's work force is either at their jobs  or commuting to and from their jobs.  A 24-hour voting period, starting on a  nonwork day, would solve that incon venience problem. Futher, simultane ous opening and closing of the polls  would eliminate early election projec tions by the media.  Simply put,  the removal of voting  barriers should be viewed as a non partisian  issue worthy of bipartisan  support.  0 1230  MARINES  SHOULD  BE WITH DRAWN FROM LEBANON AND  THEIR  INDEFENSmLE  POSI TION  <Mr. NELSON of Florida asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute and to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",1984
19,House,98,-0.194,249,1,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. Speak er,  last September  I voted  for and  spoke  for  the authorization for  the  President to keep the marines in Leba non up to 18 months.  In my judgment circumstances have  considerably changed since that legis lation was before the Congress and my  conclusion is, and I shared this with  my  constituents  before  Christmas,  that we should withdraw our marines  from Lebanon, put them on the ships,  preferably replace them and the other  high visibility  targets  such  as  the  French with an international peace keeping force such as under the flag of  the United Nations.  Marines cannot fulfill  the purpose  and the role for which they were origi nally sent to Lebanon because  they  have become the targets. They cannot  be the peacekeepers they want to be.  Furthermore,  the marines are  frus trated because the marines are taught  to be an assault force, to take the high  ground, and they are kept on the low  ground in an indefensible position. We  should withdraw our marines.  Lastly,  I  appreciate my colleague  from Florida <Mr. GIBBONS)  for his  statement before this House last Sep tember. I now agree with him.  URGE SENATE TO REJECT NOMI NATION OF ED MEESE AS AT TORNEY GENERAL  <Mr. MARKEY asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1984
20,House,98,-0.502,249,1,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr. Speaker, one of  the most important items before the  Senate is the replacement of the At torney General. The Senate will soon  have to decide, ""Is Ed Meese qualified  to hold the highest law enforcement  position in this country?""  I say that the answer to this ques tion is ""No."" Mr. Meese was behind  the administration's recent attempt to  gut the Civil Rights Commission. Mr.  Meese has engineered three proposals  to put the Legal Services Corporation  out of business, ending legal aid to the  poor.  Mr. Meese's contempt  for  critical  civil rights initiatives-like affirmative  action-is well known. And yet Ronald  Reagan wants  to put Mr. Meese  in  charge of enforcing the Nation's civil  rights laws.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I urge  the Senate to reject Ed Meese's nomi nation  for Attorney General.  4  weeks ago, Ed Meese could not find  hunger in America, can we now trust  him to find justice in our country?

Amid  all  of  the  caterwauling  about a  balanced budget, awash  in  crocodile  tears  in a  campaign year  against the Reagan deficit, the majori ty party  in  this House urges us  to  embark upon a  program which,  to  achieve marginal energy savings, will  probably cost the Federal Government  over $23 billion in the next 10 years.  Last year at this time we stampeded  through a  jobs bill, through we were  unable to get the money spent before  unemployment  began  to  plummet.  That bill contained $100 million  in  emergency  weatherization  funds.  Much of that has not even been spent,  but we are asked in this bill to make  that $100 million and some additional  funds recovered from oil overcharges a  part of the inviolable base which we  can never cut.  We should not be shocked at the du plicity in claiming that this half a bil lion dollar program is not an increase.  We should not be shocked that it is  $200 million over the majority's own  first budget resolution: That kind of  thing is all too common. We should,  however, be shocked, or at least given  reason to pause at the overall cost of  this program. The CBO estimates that  the bill will triple in cost to $1.6 billion  by 1987 and will double again the next  year to $3.2 billion.

29,,98,-0.433,327,1,Mr. HARRISON.," Mr. Speaker, on  Sunday evening, February 5, Henry R.  Manarski will be feted by his many  friends. The occasion will celebrate his  completion of 22 years as a member of  the Wilkes-Barre Area Board of Edu cation and its predecessor, the Plains  Township School Board.  During his  service on  the Plains  board, Henry was  treasurer  for  7  years. When the Greater Wilkes-Barre  area board was formed by jointure of  several communities, Henry was elect ed as an original member of the larger  board. In 1977-78 and, again, in 198182,  he  served as president of  that  board.  During his tenure, Henry served as  chairman  of  the  administration-in struction committee and was a very  active member of the athletic commit tee.  Mr. Manarski  leaves  the Wilkes Barre Area Board of Education with  every reason to feel that his has been  a job well done. During his tenure, the  board underwent many difficult situa tions and embarked upon an ambitious  construction program. In all ways, the  Wilkes-Barre Area Board of Education  is better and stronger today because of  Henry Manarski's dedicated participa tion.  is my  pleasure,  therefore,  to  salute my friend Henry on his nearly  one-quarter  century  of  service  to  American education and to pay trib ute, as well, to his wife, Leona, and his  three  children: Karen, Debra  and  Mark, whose  steadfast  support has  made possible his many community  contributions.   It  325  GLOUCESTER  TOWNSHIP  SEN IORS  COME  THROUGH  FOR  FRANKLIN SQUARE FIRE VIC TIMS  HON. JAMES J. FLORIO  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 24, 1984  e ",1984
30,,98,-0.318,327,1,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, I  take  this  opportunity  to  commend  the  senior citizens of Gloucester Township  for their impressive display of human ity and compassion at the outbreak of  a fire at the Franklin Square Senior  Citizen Complex just before the holi days. This fire, which gutted several  apartments in the complex and forced  elderly  residents  to  flee  for  their  safety, displaced 10 elderly residents.  The concern shown by other elderly  residents of  the complex  is  indeed  heartwarming.  I  laud  the efforts of  those senior citizens, as well as those  of Anna Mae Redrow, the coordinator  of  the Hider Lane Senior Citizen  Center, who were ready to help their  neighbors  in a  time of need. These  fine and upstanding citizens helped  place those residents displaced by the  fire  in a nearby motel and gave of  themselves  to  insure  that  the  dis placed seniors were made comfortable  in their new surroundings. In addition  to  coordinating  fundraising  drives,  they helped gather furniture and ap-  pliances for the unfortunate who lost  all their possessions in the fire.  At a time when budget cuts are im pinging on the already meager income  afforded  to our Nation's senior citi zens, a  tragedy such as the Franklin  Square fire could have had devastat ing effects on the elderly residents. In stead, because of the selflessness ex hibited by the unharmed residents of  Franklin Square, and because of the  love and concern that guided the ef forts of friends and neighbors, the el derly residents, whose lives were dis rupted by the fire, found solace in the  goodwill of their neighbors.  I hope my colleagues will join me in  praising the senior citizens of Franklin  Square for their courage and compas sion. Mr. Speaker, I would like to com mend the following editorial, from the  Observer, to the attention of my col leagues:  [From the Observer, Gloucester Twp., N.J.)  AN EDITORIAL: GLO. TwP.

The  theme:  ""Rethinking  Dream, Not Forgotten.""  Mr. Speaker, I would like to share  the contents of my January 16, 1984,  a  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  statement, with my colleagues here in  the Congress today.  The statement follows:  IN HONOR OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.  It is with great respect and admiration  that I pay tribute to the memory and teach ings of one of America's most outstanding  moral crusaders and civil rights leaders on  this annual memorial celebration.  Perhaps the most important legacy of Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., is that, while he  gave so much to humanity during this life time,  there remains so much more  to be  gained-if we will but listen  to him once  more. The theme: ""Rethinking a dream, not  forgottten"" is a most fitting one, because al ready  there  is a generation whose knowl edge of Dr. King is a blurring recollection of  someone in American history who spoke out  against racial segregation. This dream must  not be  forgotten, because, as my  friend  Andrew Young once put it, Dr. King's mes sage ""endures, spanning the seas and calling  out to each new generation.""  By furthering the civil rights of American  blacks, Dr. King contributed to the cause of  freedom  for  all Americans,  regardless of  race or creed. By strengthening the cause of  justice, he inspired millions throughout the  world in mankind's common aspirators. His  message of redemption and reconciliation is  no less meaningful  today than during his  lifetime. His life's work and unyielding ad herence to achieving social change through  nonviolence  serves  as  a  great  example  during these turbulent and troubled times.  The enactment of Federal legislation last  year, has finally made commemoration of.  Dr. King's birthday a permanent  reality.  This, indeed, marks a milestone in our con tinuing efforts to bring about a truly plural istic society based on mutual respect for one  another. Bestowing this honor on Dr. King,  not only  transcends his status as a black  civil rights leader, it serves as recognition  that he spoke as an American about the  spiritual liberation of all people. He spoke  of brotherhood, of an end to poverty, of jus tice, of peace to you, yes, but also to me and  to all mankind.e  AN INSIDERS VIEW OF OUR  NATION'S CLASSROOMS  HON. BARBARA B. KENNELLY  OF CONNECTICUT  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 24, 1984  e ",1984
32,,98,-0.346,340,1,Mrs. KENNELLY.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to draw the attention of my  colleagues to a particularly thoughtful  and perceptive article which appeared  in the January 10, 1984, edition of the  Hartford Courant. This opinion piece  was authored by a history teacher of  24  years, Wayne Loveland, of Hall  High School in West Hartford, Conn.  Mr. Loveland addresses something  I  believe all of us will have cause and  need  to address  in  this coming ses sion-how  to  right what has  gone  wrong  in  our  public  educational  system. I hope that Mr. Loveland, and  other dedicated teachers like him, will  continue to provide us with an insider's view of our Nation's classrooms.  The article follows:  January 24, 1984  [From the Hartford Courant, Jan. 10, 1984]  DoN'T BLAME TEACHERS IF THE PAPERBOY  HASN'T HEARD OF MUSSOLINI  <By Wayne Loveland>  Prominent among the barrage of criticism  being leveled at our public schools lately is  the charge, or implication, that the root of  the problem is inadequate teaching.  Having  served  in classrooms  in  several  communities for more than three decades, I  consider  this  an  incorrect  assumption.  There are indeed some mediocre teachers in  our schools, but  they are  the exception  rather than the rule. The academic creden tials and personal qualities of the teachers  with whom I associate compare favorably  with those of other professionals in the pri vate sector of our economy.  The principal factors that have contribut ed  to scholastic decline can be  traced  to  changes that have occurred beyond the con fines of the school buildings. Teachers have  not caused these changes, and should not be  regarded as architects of academic mediocri ty. Rather, our educators are the principal  victims of this decline.  There is today considerably less structure  and  order  throughout our  society  than  there was two decades ago.  More young people attend our nation's  schools, for longer periods of time, than in  any advanced country in the world. In 1980  close to 95 percent of our teenagers were in  school, compared to 60 percent in England  and 40 percent in West Germany. Some of  these young people are congenitally un equipped to learn in any traditional sense.  Yet another percentage of pupils is largely  uninterested in academics for a variety of  reasons.  Our schools are not only educational insti tutions but ""holding stations'' for society.  The present-day educator must often serve  as social worker, warden and teacher. Sub stantial tensions result from these multiple  responsibilities.  Several specific factors have contributed  to the decline in academic performance. The  sometimes negative impact of television  is  clear  to everyone. The passive sedentary  patterns acquired in childhood become in grained over the years. Television has also  accustomed students to fast-paced, rapidly  shifting presentations and programs. These  are in stark contrast to the seemingly prosa ic and pedestrian presentations of the class room  teacher. Even a Robert Redford or  Dolly Parton would have difficulty main taining  student  interest while  discussing  math  sets or Woodrow Wilson's  foreign  policy five times a day five times a week.  I  suggest  that  some  laymen who  are  among the most critical of teacher perform ance should try secondary  teaching for a  period of two or three months in order to  properly evaluate their personal magnetism.  The serious erosion of our religious and  family structures has also adversely affect ed student performance. In 1979 nearly 40  percent of our nation's children belonged to  single  parent  families. Other marriages  which are officially intact are de facto oper ational failures. The child who comes  to  school from a broken or unhappy home is  not particularly enthusiastic about review ing the historical subtleties of the postwar  world. The cold war in his own home domi nates his thinking-both within and without  the classroom.  1980s learn little of an informational nature  Furthermore, most young adults of  the  from  their parents,  let alone  from  their  grandparents and other relatives.

Although our can didates are generally of a high caliber,  there was one young man that year  who stood out from  the crowd, and  who displayed leadership and a poten tial for service that earmarked him as  a young man with a bright future.  I was  proud  to  concur with  the  advice of our review board and named  Dyke Harrison Whitbeck as my princi pal nominee  to  the U.S. Air Force  Academy  that  year.  Having  just  turned 18, Dyke had already earned an  outstanding  reputation at  the War wick Valley High School, for his ex ceptional academic standing,  for his  leadership as a member of his student  seenate and as his junior class presi dent, and as a member of the baseball,  football, basketball, and soccer teams.  The Air Force Academy concurred  with my nomination, and Dyke WhitEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  beck was admitted to the class of 1978.  I followed his career at the Academy  with keen interest, for I was confident  that this was a young man who would  be a credit to his academy and to his  Nation.  Upon graduat!ng from the Academy,  I was pleased to learn that Dyke Whit beck subsequently rose to the rank of  captain in the Air Force.  Two weeks ago, I accompanied sever al of my  colleagues on  the House  Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse  and Control on our fact-finding mis sion  to Asia. While we were seeking  ways to stem the tide of illicit narcot ics with officials from other lands, we  received word  that a U.S. Air Force  helicopter had crashed while trying to  interdict a drug dropoff in the Baha mas. It was especially poignant that  the news was received by us at that  time and under those circumstances,  for we were trying to impress upon the  leaders of our host nations the serious ness  and  the determination of  the  United States  in  the war we  are  waging  to stem  the  illicit narcotics  trade. Saddened as we were by the loss  of five of our finest Air Force men, we  were able  to  inform our hosts  that  many, many courageous public serv ants are risking their lives to stop the  disease of narcotics trafficking.  It was not until I returned home this  week that I  learned that one of our  missing Air Force officers was Capt.  Dyke H. Whitbeck.  When  I called Captain Whitbeck's  parents to express my. personal sense  of loss, I was impressed by their cour age  through  this  heartwrenching  ordeal. It was as if they were saying  that Dyke did not give his life in vain;  that by helping to halt the flow of  narcotics into our Nation, his life may  well have been given  to save other  lives.  Mr. Speaker,  the Whitbeck  family  has suffered a great personal loss, but  so has our Nation. Capt. Dyke Whit beck should be remembered as an out standing public servant whose life was  tragically lost in our war against nar cotics. He should be remembered as a  symbol of our Nation's determination  to halt this threat to the very fabric of  our society.e  A TRIBUTE TO MR. CHARLES G.  DAVIS, SR.: AN OUTSTANDING  EDUCATOR  HON.

Mr. Davis  had many  accomplish ments  in both his professional and  personal life that brought him many  awards and recognitions.  During his lifespan, Mr. Davis was  an  inspiration  to  thousands of St.  Louisan whose  lives he affected and  will be missed dearly.  The following is the article:  Charles Davis, more affectionately known  as ""Chappie"" was a native St. Louisan and  was a product of the St. Louis Public School  System. He attended and graduated from  Charles Sumner as an honor student. He  was on the Dean's Roll during his entire col lege career at Stowe Teacher's College and  received a Masters Degree in Education for  the  University  of  Illinois,  Champagne  Urbana, Illinois.  Chappie was well  liked by  friends and  family because of his witty and charming  to  personality and his continuous efforts  serve the community in trying to improve  the educational  system  in our area. He  shared his academic skills and experience  while dedicating his life to youth serving as  a teacher and administrator for many years.  He served in an administrative capacity at  the Sumner Elementary Center, Beaumont  Elementary Center, and the Lincoln Insti tute Summer Program. He also served as  principal of Emerson, Mitchell and Dewey  Elementary School.  Davis was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi  Fraternity, The Nuclues Club  and The  Royal Vagabonds. His professional  affili ations included the Administrators Associa tion of St. Louis Public Schools, Local 44,  The International Reading Association, The  Na~onal Education Association  and The  Missouri State Teachers Association. He was  also an active member of St. Philips Lu theran Church where he  served  as  the  Chairman of the Finance Committee.  Chappie  is  survived by his wife, Agnes  Williamson-Davis who is also an educator in  the St. Louis Public School System, a son,  Charles G.

36,House,98,-0.506,366,1,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me this time, and I would first  like  to add my own compliments  to  those already expressed by the gentle man from Oregon <Mr. WEAVER) to the  chairman of the committee for the sig nificant statement that he made ini tially with regard to the significance  of this bill.  I think it is an important bill. It is a  bill, of course, dealing with the future  of this country and the need to con serve energy, to conserve soil, and to  conserve water in order to have  the  kind of productive agriculture 50 years  from now which was so well stated by  the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  with regard to the Amish farmers in  his own district. They have been farm ing that land for 300 years and main taining the productivity of that land.  A good share of the land currently  being farmed in this country is being  eroded at the rate of over 5 tons per  year and will not be farmable 50 years  from now, to say nothing of 300 years  from now. We need  the kind of re search that is reflected by this bill.  I would like to point out that in the  subcommittee which I have the honor  to chair, this bill was reported out by a  vote of 9 to 2, including a majority of  the Republicans. In the full committee  it was reported out by a vote of 26 to  10. There really was not that much  controversy in the committee, where  we are familiar with the importance of  this subject.  The controversy arose, the questions  arose, and the negative votes arose be cause the Department was opposed to  it. The Department says that they do  not need the authority, and if it were  all that important, they could be doing  it. And that is true. They were doing  it. The Department of Agriculture had  an excellent program for coordinating  organic farm research in this country.  They issued an excellent report which  stimulated a great deal of interest. It  brought  inquiries  from all over  the  world as to what was being done.  The Department does do research. It  is not necessarily called organic  re search, but it is on farm systems and  on  integrated pest management and  on energy conservation, which is relat ed  to  this  subject. They  had  one  person over there coordinating the re quests for information, and in effect  they fired  that person. There was and I do not think there is any ques tion about this-a desire to downgrade  the posture of this kind of research in  the Department.  There is-and we have to face this some objection  to  this kind of  re search.

38,Senate,98,-0.214,405,1,Mr. EXON.," Mr. President, I  thank  my good and trusted friend from Ari zona for his kind comments. I agree  completely with what he has said.  I also wish to thank my friend from  New Jersey for bringing up the matter  of pension portability. As I said to the  Senate a  few moments  ago,  and  I  repeat, I have carefully reviewed the  developments since our successful ef forts to block the FCC action by send ing S. 1660 to the floor. I think it is ap propriate that I say at this time, Mr.  President, that I have also reviewed,  as a part of the overall bill, the matter  of pension portability and, as did the  Senator  from New  Jersey,  I  have  checked  into  this matter very  thor oughly.  I find that the American Telephone  and Telegraph Co.,  their top leader ship,  in whom I have confidence  in  this area, and also all of their former  operating companies  that have now  been separated from Mother Bell, all  agree that pension portability is some thing that should be recognized. They  have no difficulty with it whatsoever.  I guess  then, after discussing  this  with the representatives of the CW A,  those representing the workers of that  great  system  also  agree  and  seem  united on  the  thought that pension  portability  is and should be kept  in  the final agreement.  Therefore, I  find no differences of  opinion among  the members of  the  Commerce Committee on this particu lar question. Indeed, I find no objec tion by any other Member of the U.S.  Senate. Therefore,  that is one more  thing that has been resolved. And, at  some appropriate time, I can confiden tially predict that there will be no dif ficulty whatsoever in passing legisla tion, if indeed legislation is necessary,  to clear up the matter of pension port ability.  That is just one more reason, I sug gest, that it is not in the interest of  our communications system for us to  proceed any further with S. 1660 that  I strongly supported out of committee.  Because of the recent actions of the  FCC, I  think that legislation at this  time simply is superfluous.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",1984

40,Senate,98,0.498,418,1,Mr. QUAYLE.," Mr. President,  al though we are currently enjoying the  fruits of an economic expansion, prob lems persist in our international trade.  If these problems continue, they could  cause a loss of jobs in major U.S. in dustries and abort the recovery.  For example, largely due to differ ences between United States and Japa nese tax policies, as well as due to dif ferences in currency valuation, Japa nese  automakers  currently  enjoy  a  $2,000 competitive advantage over U.S.  carmakers. U.S.  auto manufacturers  are very concerned about  the  long term prospects for the health of their  industry. Over the last several weeks I  have received letters from several of  them. I ask that these letters be re printed in the RECORD.  The letters follow:  CHRYSLER CORP.,  December 12, 1983.  Hon. DAN QUAYLE,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, D. C.  DEAR DAN: On behalf of all of us at Chrys ler, I want you to know how much we appre ciate your leadership in rallying support in  the Senate for your resolution urging con tinuation of the voluntary restraint agree ment on Japanese cars at present  levels.  The speed with which SCR 81  attracted  almost 20 percent of the Senate as biparti san co-sponsors sent a clear message to the  Administration, as well as to the Japanese,  that there is serious concern in the Con gress about the ""un-level playing field"" on  which we compete  in our  trade relations  with Japan.  While we achieved at best a ""limited"" vic tory by having the Administration agree to  about a 10 percent increase in current vol umes for one year, I am confident that your  help as sponsor of SCR 81 was instrumental  in preventing the figure  from going even  higher.  We believe that serious issues relating to  the trade imbalance between Japan and the  United States, the undervalued yen as com pared to the dollar, and the burden of taxes  on domestic auto manufacturers not shared  by  foreign  imports  cannot  be  resolved  within one year. These factors, which have  nothing to do with productivity or quality,  result in a substantial competitive cost ad vantage of about $2,000 for Japanese manu facturers, all to the detriment of our domes tic industry.  The solutions depend upon Government  action in both countries, and there is little  to  indicate  that such  initiatives will  take  place. As a matter of fact, recent press re ports  indicate that Honda,  the most pro gressive of the Japanese manufacturers, is  considering a second car assembly plant in  this country because they believe there will  be  some  sort of export  regulations <i.e.  quotas> for sometime to come. The clear in ference  is  that they also believe  there  is  little chance of meaningful restructuring of  the yen/dollar relationship or equalization  of the tax burdens between the two coun tries in the near future.  It is obvious to me that we must look at  the events of the past few weeks as the  opening round in a continuing campaign to  level  out  the  competitive  playing  field  which is now so sharply tilted in favor of  Japan.  Resolution of these issues and unequivo cal indication from this Administration that  it  is  prepared  to  support continued  re straints until they are resolved is of particu lar concern to Chrysler Corporation in 1984.  We have critical policy decisions to make on  small car production for the 80's and 90's whether to manufacture them in this coun try or source them off shore.  We will be back to you in the first quarter  of 1984 to relate how we can together work  to maintain current employment levels by  addressing these persistent trade problems.  Again, Dan, thanks for your help and sup port-Merry Christmas and best wishes for  a Happy and prosperous New Year!  Sincerely,  LEE IACOCCA.  ESSEX SPECIALTY PRODUCTS, INC.,  CliJton, N.J., December 20, 1983.  Senator DAN QuAYLE,  Indianapolis, Ind.  DEAR  SENATOR QuAYLE: Essex Specialty  Products, Inc. is a supplier to the American  automobile industry. As such, we are direct ly affected by and concerned with automo bile import policies.  We feel that the Japanese automobile in dustry  is competing unfairly. This unfair  competition is resulting in the loss of mil lions of  jobs and serious damage  to our  automobile and  automobile-related  indus tries.  Two examples of the advantages enjoyed  by  the  Japanese  automobile  companies  doing business in America are seen in the  artificially low valuation of the yen and the  Japanese tax policy. Since 1981, the Japa nese have kept the value of their yen artifi cially low as compared to the U.S. dollar.  This has allowed them to sell more cars in  the U.S. at lower prices,  to make higher  profits, and take away our jobs. Japanese  tax policy  then gives manufacturers  an other advantage of about $1,000 for each car  sold in the U.S. By refunding some of the  taxes normally paid in Japan when a car is  exported to America, the Japanese goven ment subsidizes its auto industry.  In addition, for each Japanese car that is  imported, we  lose about $1,700  in federal,  state and local taxes that would have been  paid if the car had been manufactured in  the U.S. Who makes up this difference? The  American taxpayer.  We've all been working hard to produce  high quality, competitive products. But we  need your help  to eliminate some of the  unfair advantages held by  the  Japanese  doing business in America. Without automo bile  restrictions, we may destroy some of  our most important industries and perma nently eliminate millions of jobs.  Sincerely,  W. E. LEUCHTEN,  President.  EVANSVILLE, IND.,  November 16, 1983.  Senator DAN QuAYLE,  Senate Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR SIR: This letter is being written with  reference  to the automobile  industry and  the Japanese imports into our country.  No doubt you are aware of the percentage  of Japanese cars sold in the United States  which is approximately 22 percent.  It is said that every Japanese car sold here  the  federal,  state and  local  taxes  loses  $1750.  Since 1981  the Japanese have kept  the  value of their yen low as compared to our  dollar, thus allowing more cars to be sold at  lower prices.  It is my understanding that one of our  cars sold in Japan is double what we pay for  it here in the U.S., while a Japanese car  sells for less here than in Tokyo.  The thousands of Japanese cars sold in  our  country  has  caused  unemployment  reaching into the 300,000 in our auto indus try.  There are some predictions that if no re strictions are put on their cars, that by 1987  they could  take 35  to 40 percent of our  market.  We Americans cannot ignore the fact that  we have vital industries like the automobile  that needs protecting. Our American gov ernment should not hesitate to use quotas  and other policies to restore fair competi tion.  Now, a little about myself:  I had worked in the automobile industry  almost all my life, working for Chrysler 37  years. The last 35 on management, moving  around and finally retiring at the St. Louis  car assembly plant in 1971.  My wife and I moved back to Evansville in  1975 to be near our grandchildren.  The past six years I have been Republican  precinct committeeman and certainly have  enjoyed it.  This information is not only being report ed for myself but many other retired Chrys ler workers whom I have talked with here in  Evansville. We are all so thankful for Mr.  Lee Iacocca's leadership of Chrysler but also  the U.S. Government and State who helped  the corporation financially when it looked  like they could not continue.  Our pensions, hospitalization and doctors  insurance was at stake.  What can you do to help our future auto mobile industry and also hold down unem ployment by getting our Government to es tablish a limit on Japanese cars entering our  country?  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  JAMES GRIFFITH .   ",1984
41,,98,0.353,431,1,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker, Edson  W. Spencer is chairman and chief ex ecutive officer of Honeywell Inc., one  of our country's largest defense suppli ers. In the December 23 Minneapolis  Star & Tribune, he published a paper  urging a zero tactical nuclear weapons  level.  Spencer's proposal  is  understand able, but not simplistic. It would not  disturb the standoff in strategic weap ons, but could set the stage for a build down process.  I  commend  the article, which  fol lows, to thoughtful students of nucle ar arms reductions.  TACTICAL ZERO  <By Edson W. Spencer>  The world today faces three grave risks,  any one of which could cause a nuclear acci dent, which could in turn lead to a major  war. The risk of such a war may be greater  than at any time since Hitler marched into  the Rhineland  in 1936. The potential for  cataclysmic damage is far greater.  One risk brought abruptly into focus was  signaled by the dangerous series of mistakes  apparently made by the Soviet air defense  in shooting down Korean Airlines Flight  007. The mistakes that led to the tragic loss  of a civilian aircraft suggest the possibility  of a series of mistakes leading to something  far worse.  A  second  risk  relates  to  proliferation  among nations of the capacity to manufac ture nuclear weapons-and to steal  them.  The dangers in the use of these weapons as  potential blackmail threats pose a risk for  all nations, including the two super powers.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  A third risk is due to uncertainties at the  top of Soviet civilian leadership, which cur rently appears weak and unsure of its direc tions. The military appears to be taking a  stronger role, and maneuvering for the next  succession  could  further weaken present  leaders. This in turn will probably prolong  the present period of high tension between  our country and the Soviet Union, making it  difficult to accomplish significant progress  to lessen the tension through negotiations.  The history of negotiations between our  two nations is not encouraging. As a result,  the risks inherent in nuclear confrontation  seem to be accelerating faster than our abil ity to negotiate safety nets that reduce the  chance of nuclear explosions.  To mitigate these risks, a creative new ini tiative is needed by our government, an ini tiative that would seek to achieve an imme diate set of objectives rather than gradually  negotiate toward such an end over a  long  period with very limited progress in elimi nating the risks. As a concerned citizen who  is also the chief executive of a major corpo ration <Honeywell Inc. with over $800 mil lion in defense contracts last year>. I feel  strongly that we must bring into play a new  approach and an even more heightened  sense of urgency. Here are some sugges tions:  First, we  should offer  to  remove  from  Europe all tactical nuclear weapons, includ ing missile warheads and munitions, and  return them to the United States.  Second, we should then offer immediate ly-with complete Soviet access for verifica tion-to destroy these and all other tactical  nuclear weapons in our arsenal as well as  seeing that those of our NATO allies are  also destroyed.  Third,  the  conditions  required  of  Soviet Union for our agreeing to do  would be:  The signing and ratification of a  treaty  between our country, our NATO allies and  the Soviet Union banning further develop ment or manufacture of  tactical nuclear  weapons:  Simultaneous with our elimination of tac tical nuclear weapons, the destruction of all  tactical nuclear weapons in the Soviet arse nal, with free access and verification by U.S.  and other NATO observers;  Acceptance by the Soviet Union of a joint  approach to some type of risk-reduction or  crisis-avoidance center so  that a mistake  may be prevented from becoming a cata clysm: and  Finally,  a U.S./U.S.S.R.-sponsored U.N.  agreement banning development and manu facture of tactical nuclear weapons by any  member country, with  the United States  and Soviet Union agreeing to enforce this  ban together.  This would  still  leave  the  two  super  powers at a  stand-off  in  intercontinental  strategic weapons, but with  the potential  for negotiating a build-down option on both  sides. Build-down to the level of a minimum  but still meaningful deterrent might take a  decade and, to zero, a lifetime.  If we and the Soviet Union can move in  the direction of significantly reducing the  number of nuclear weapons, our two coun tries should then enter into broad-ranging  discussions at various levels, both private sector and government,  in an attempt  to  define our  future  relationships  in other  areas. The objectives of our two countries,  our historical background and our mind sets  are very different. But we do have to coex ist, and to do so we need to have continuous  dialogue and a much deeper inderstanding  the  this  429  r  of each other's motivations, fears and con cerns.  Critics of this proposal may say it is im practical. It is  impractical  if one or both  super powers do not have the will to negoti ate, as that only prolongs  the bargaining  stalemate. It is not at all impractical if it  can bring both sides back to the table and  move the negotiations forward. It makes our  intention clear and could put the Soviet  Union on the spot, causing it to show the  world its intentions as well. The accomplish ment of ""tactical zero"" would be in the na tional self-interest of both nations. The pro posal in no way changes our nation's need  for a strong defense in conventional weapons.  Idealistic? Yes. Progress  is never made  without  ideals. Weapons reduction cannot  change the attitudes and fears that led to  their creation in the first place. But a suc cessful negotiation leading to a meaningful  reduction of  the nuclear  threat on both  sides may help, in turn, to modify those atti tudes and fears.  Such a position offers a better negotiating  posture than the Reagan ""zero option"" pro posal, which  provided  that  the United  States would not deploy and that the Sovi ets would  reduce  intermediate-range mis siles in and around Europe. Even if it were  accepted by the Soviet Union, this proposal  would have left a substantial nuclear arse nal in Europe on both sides. On the other  hand, if the proposal I am putting forward  for a ""tactical zero"" option could be negoti ated, it would eliminate the greatest area of  risk for accidentally, or through blackmail,  triggering a nuclear disaster. It would clear ly define where the free world wants to go  in armament reductions. It would provide  the present and  future Soviet  leadership  with an alternative to protracted negotia tions  that reduces numbers but not risk,  while relieving  its defense budget of sub stantial expeditures. It would have great  public appeal.  Most  important,  if  successful,  ""tactical  zero"" would move the world substantially in  the direction of becoming a safer place in  which to live.e  THE ERA/ABORTION  CONNECTION  HON.

The MSAW  system is not just some abstract cog in  the Nation's air traffic control system.  Last year, the system saved the lives  of passengers on an Argentine airliner  that came critically close to colliding  with the World Trade Center in New  York City.  NATIONAL SECURITY  The Department of Commerce, by  written agreement, shares information  available  through  the Aeronautical  Chart Division during times of nation al emergency. In other words, during  an emergency,  the Defense Depart ment's need for accurate and up-to date charts of the Nation's air traffic  lines becomes critical as resources are  mobilized  for  transport around  the  country. For this reason alone, the de cision  to  contract  the  aeronautical  charting function must not be consid ered ""business as usual"" in implement ing OMB Circular A-76. In my view,  the Congress would be remiss if it did  less than insist on the most rigorous  review of  this matter. The Congress  has  already  shown  rare wisdom  in  demonstrating similar concern in this  legislation for the proposed contract ing of our Nation's weather satellite  system.  LIABILITY  Both the Federal Tort Claims Act  and  the Admiralty Act  require  the  Government  to assume  full  liability  for information contained on its nauti cal charts.  I  should point out  that  NOAA's Nautical Chart Division  is  also under review for contract. There fore,  it is both possible, and in fact  probable,  that  the  contractor will  avoid liability. If such were to become  the case, I would find it hard to under stand how one could legitimately con duct an equitable comparison of the  costs of the contract. In my view, the  taxpayers' exposure to risk in a pri vately contracted venture would mark edly increase. A bad deal for the Gov ernment is a bad deal for the taxpay er.

47,House,98,-0.429,496,1,Mr. PRICE.," Mr. Speaker, the Hon orable Sterling Cole, a former Member  of  this body and my esteemed col league  on  the  Joint Congressional  Committee on Atomic Energy, made  an important speech during the recess  which  I want  to  share with other  Members. He opened the Conference  on Atoms  for Peace  held  by  the  Georgetown University  Center  for  Strategic and International Studies on  December 7 and 8, 1983. In his address  my good  friend Stub Cole gave his  views on the subject of nuclear prolif eration. Fully accepting the fact that  his  views  reflect  his  personal  thoughts, I strongly commend them to  you since he is a person with a great  deal of experience  in atomic energy  development particularly as a member  and chairman of the first committee  of Congress exclusively responsible for  legislation  in  the  field  and as  the  former Director General of the Inter national Atomic Energy Agency. Ac cordingly,  I am happy to include at  the conclusion of these remarks Mr.  Sterling Cole's complete statement for  the information of all of the Members:  REMARKS OF HON.  STERLING CoLE AT  THE  OPENING OF THE CONFERENCE ON ATOMS FOR  PEACE: AFTER 30 Years  It is a signal honor for me to open this  conference  commemorating  the  thirtieth  anniversary of the great Atoms for Peace  address  to  the United Nations  in which  Dwight Eisenhower electrified  the world  with his call upon all nations to join togeth er not only in halting the build-up of nucle ar armaments but also in putting the atom  to work for human betterment by peaceful  uses of  the very  same nuclear material  which was used for war. Few,  if any, ad dresses have ever done so much to raise the  world's hopes for a future filled with prom ise rather than peril, and I am proud to  have been involved in the background which  brought it about.  You have asked me to share with you this  morning my thoughts on the subject of nu clear proliferation.  When we hear or see the word ""prolifera tion"", we of course think of the dangers to  peace that are created by horizontal prolif eration-that is, the addition of new nations  to the ranks of those already possessing nu clear arms-and also by vertical prolifera tion, that is, enlarging stockpiles of the na tions that already had nuclear weapons.  But to stop there would be a mistake. The  costs of proliferation must be measured in  terms of opportunities lost as well as dan gers created. Every dollar or ruble or other  unit of currency that is spent on nuclear  weaponry diminishes the resources that are  available  for  projects  promoting  benign  human purposes.  Nobody  has  ever perceived  the  conse quences of the proliferation problem more  clearly than did Dwight Eisenhower him self. As he put it in his historic speech: ""It is  not enough to take this weapon out of the  hands of the soldiers. We must put it in the  hands of those who will know how to strip  its military casing and adapt it to the arts of  peace.""  Toward this end, he invited the weapons  states to make joint contributions of fission able materials  to an international agency  that would be created under UN auspices  and that would be responsible for devising  methods of using the materials in construc tive ways.  ""A  special purpose"", he  said,  ""would be  to provide abundant electrical  energy  in  the power-starved areas of the  world.""  What do the ledger entries look like if we  now try to strike a  trial balance on where  the problem of proliferation stands three  decades after that speech?  On the good side, we have the Interna tional Atomic Energy Agency.  It has  a  highly competent staff which has served  the world extremely well, both in helping  protect against the bad in the atom and in  taking advantage of the good. Furthermore,  it has the good fortune to have a Director  General who has increasingly demonstrated  his high qualities as an effective leader.  The Non-Proliferation Treaty is another  major entry on the plus side of the ledger. I  fear we may take too much for granted both  in the extraordinary nature of the commit ments made by the Treaty's signers, and the  fact  that  there has never been a  single  known violation of  the  IAEA-NPT  safe guards system. We must, of course, regret  the ease with which a signatory may with draw from the Treaty at any time. Also it is  regrettable that many nations have so far  refrained from signing the NPT, and that  their ranks include several whose technical  capabilities are unquestionably equal to pro ducing nuclear weapons. Finally. we must  regret the considerations that caused some  nations to add their names to the list of  those that already possessed nuclear arms  at the time Dwight Eisenhower spoke; then  there were 3 and now  there are 9 which  have or can have them.  To date,  the accretions  to  the world's  weapons stockpiles that have resulted from  horizontal proliferation have been greatly  overshadowed by  the  immense growth  in  the number and destructive power of the  weapons in the arsenals of the nuclear su perpowers by vertical proltferation.  In connection with the problem of prolif eration, I must insert here a strong criticism  of the Nuclear Proliferation Act of 1978 in  which Congress created severe impediments  to American participation in international  trade in the fabrication of power reactors  which should be remedied at once by cre ation by the President of a blue ribbon com mission  to make recommendations so for eign countries may continue to benefit from  our competitive technology in the field of  peaceful uses.  With weapons  technology now at  the  point where the explosion of Just a single  warhead can lay waste to the largest Soviet  or American city, the strategic forces of the  two sides alone have between  them well  over 15,000 warheads. And when other than  strategic weapons are also  taken  into ac count, the combined inventories of the two  powers approximate 40,000 weapons.  American  policy  announcements  about  the circumstances under which we might  feel compelled to use atomic weapons have  varied over  time.  In  the years when we  alone possessed nuclear arms, and also  in  the subsequent years when our margin of  atomic superiority was overwhelming, we  made it unmistakably clear that we would  draw upon our atomic arsenals for help if  we  faced  threats  that could not be con tained through conventional means.  In  recent years, our declarations about  when we might be forced to turn to atomic  weaponry  for  our defense  have  become  more  ambiguous. One  element  in  these  policy pronouncements, however, has  re mained unchanged. We have never been  willing  to declare  that we would  refrain  from  using nuclear weapons  so  long  as  others refrained from using them, as the So viets have done.  Our refusal  to make such a no-first-use  pledge has related both to war deterrence  and war waging. We have feared that ruling  out the first use option would invite aggres sion. A foe  that thought it could prevail  against our side in a war fought solely with  conventional  forces,  we  have  reasoned,  would be more likely to strike if he thought  he could do so without inviting nuclear re taliation. We have  also  feared  that  the  strength of  the other side's conventional  forces might make it impossible for us to  contain  a  conventional  attack without  resort to nuclear arms.  Of late, our stand on nuclear weapons use  has been increasingly questioned. Would it  not be the case,  the questioners ask, that  any use of such weapons, however limited,  would almost inevitably lead to increasingly  devastating exchanges that could well esca late into a general nuclear war that brought  ruination to both sides? Might our national  interest therefore not be better served by  moving toward a second-use-only policy in  which we would pledge not to use nuclear  weapons unless another party used  them  first?  I presume that many of you have read  what is perhaps the best known summation  of the concerns of those  troubled by our  present day position on nuclear weapons  use. I refer to the article entitled ""Nuclear  Weapons and the Atlantic Alliance"" that ap peared in the Spring 1982 issue of Foreign  Affairs and which reflected the thinking of  four  distinguished Americans who  have  served  the Presidents of both parties  in  high national security posts.  Provided there is a political will to do so,  the authors believe, it is within the capacity  of the Atlantic Alliance to raise its conven tional forces to a level needed for the adop tion of a policy  in which our side would  pledge not to use  its nuclear weapons so  long as the other side did not use theirs.  And they see compelling arguments, both  political and military, and moving  toward  ",1984

50,Senate,98,0.391,509,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, I  rise to commend to the attention of  the Senate a book entitled Real Peace:  a Stategy  for  the West written by  former President Richard M. Nixon.  As a student of international policy  during his political career and as the  leading administrator of  foreign af fairs during his Presidency, Richard  Nixon is highly qualified to make a re sponsible statement concerning world  affairs. In this new book, former Presi dent Nixon has assembled a concise  and cogent plan for developing a last ing peace, and I am pleased that he  has recorded his ideas and that they  will receive the consideration they de serve.  The diametrically opposed philoso phies  of  the Governments  of  the  U.S.S.R. and  the United States are  generally considered  to be the most  apparent  and potentially  the most  volatile threat to global peace which  exists  in the world  today. Although  the differences and problems between  the two countries are extremely com plex, frustrating, and seemingly non negotiable,  President Nixon  asserts  that we are currently experiencing a  highly unique situation, as both the  Soviet Union and the United States  have a common interest of avoiding a  world war that neither country could  survive.  In the past few years,  the Soviet  Union has made significant advances  in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and  Latin America. It is estimated that the  U.S.S.R. has close to 125,000 military  personnel throughout the globe, pro tecting their newly acquired national  interest. However,  as  their holdings  expand  and  the  influence  of  the  U.S.S.R. grows stronger, so also does  the burden of financing their adven turism.  Nixon  purports  that  the  U.S.S.R. has clearly endangered their  economic stability in the recent past in  their attempt  to  isolate  the United  States. The  threat of overextension  has  prompted  the  leaders  of  the  U.S.S.R. to seriously reevaluate their  world  standing,  and Nixon believes  that now is the time to deal.  Probably  the most  insightful and  useful principle contained  in ""Real  Peace"" is Nixon's belief that the key  to attaining peace  is  to understand  and control the national  interer.t of  the U.S.S.R. It is certain that when  dealing with the leaders of the Com munist Party in Russia that they will  act, not necessarily according  to ac cepted ethical and moral standards,  but always in their own best interests.  It has been difficult for the United  States to deal effectively with the, at  best, amoral  foreign policies of  the  U.S.S.R., because we have an obliga tion and responsibility to combat their  policies with morally responsible deci",1984

52,Senate,98,-0.262,548,1,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, I rise in  opposition to the motion to table con sideration of S. 1660,  the Universal  Telephone Service Preservation Act. I  do so because I believe it is time for  Congress to accept responsibility for  setting telecommunications policy.  For the past 20 years, Congress has  stood on the sidelines while telecom munications policy was  set by  the  courts,  the Justice Department, and  the FCC. We stood and watched when  competition was  injected  into  the  system,  although  it was  clear  that  such action would have serious conse quences. We  stood and watched as  technology advanced at a rate far too  rapid  to be  accommodated  by  the  guidelines set in the 1934 Communica tions Act. We stood and watched as  the world's best  telephone company  was broken apart, with no one provid ing a clear understanding of how the  transition would be managed.  Do not misunderstand me. I am not  here to speak against competition or  technological  advancement,  or  to  argue that we should try to put the  Bell System back together. All I am  saying is that throughout this period as decisions were made that affected  jobs, trade, and the future of universal  service-Congress stood silent.  Today we are paying the price for  our silence. Decisions made by those  outside this body over the past two  decades are coming together, seeming ly all at once, in a way that has placed  tremendous upward pressure on local  telephone rates. Some of this pressure  is real, some is rhetoric. Much of it  could be eliminated if Congress would  speak with a clear voice and would lay  out some guidelines for the FCC and  state regulatory bodies to follow.  In  the  absence  of  congressional  action, these decisions will be left to  the FCC. Unfortunately, the FCC has  demonstrated an  inability  to send a  clear signal on these  issues, when a  clear signal  is sorely needed. Let us  look at the record:  July, 1983: on  the eve of Joint House Senate hearings in the access charge deci sion, the FCC voted to reduce the first-year  charges and to extend the transition period.  October, 1983: just prior to consideration  of H.R. 4102,  the FCC voted  to suspend  access charges until April, 1984.  December, 1983: the FCC issued a study  that attempted  to minimize  the  role of  access  charges and other FCC-mandated  changes in the escalating local rates.  Yesterday, the FCC tentatively decided to  extend  its  own moratorium  on  access  charges until after the 1984 elections.  The FCC's on-again off-again record  of the past year has not removed un certainty; it has compounded it.  I believe the time has come for Con gress to assume its responsibility for  setting  telecommunications  policy.  Without legislation,  there  is no cer tainty for the consumer that universal  service will be preserved. Without leg islation, State regulatory bodies will  be unable to accurately evaluate rate  requests. Without  legislation,  tele phone companies will be unable to ac curately  determine  their  legitimate  capital and operating costs. Like other  businesses, telephone companies need  to remain financially viable, and their  employees need  to have  their hard  earned pension rights protected.  In fact, if we fail to act today, only  one thing is certain: the 99th Congress  will be guaranteed its No. 1 domestic  issue-telecommunications.  A  con sumer revolt over dramatically higher  and more complicated telephone bills  will force its consideration. We will be  forced to plow the same furrow, but a  lot deeper next time.  ",1984

56,Senate,98,-0.301,574,1,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  this afternoon a number of us leaving  a Democratic Caucus in the LBJ room  learned that members of the press are  evidently to be forbidden access to the  hallway that leads from the top of the  Senate steps to the Senate Chamber.  This presumably is a measure being  taken, or being contemplated, as part  of the general tightening up of access  to various parts of the Capitol followIn  ing the detonation of a bomb outside  the Senate Chamber on the night of  November 7, 1983.  I am sure this is being done, or is  being planned with the best of inten tions, but  I would  suggest  to  the  Senate that it is the very worst of re sponses.  The subject of terrorism is one that  is much on our minds at this moment;  possibly,  perhaps  likely  to  become  even more so as the decade progresses.  It is all the more important, then, that  we should think clearly about it.  I do not present myself as someone  with any greater knowledge of  the  subject than the next person, but it  may be that having served in several  ambassadorial posts, and for 7 years  now, on the Select Committee on In telligence, I have been somewhat more  involved with  the matter.  any  event, I have written and spoken on  the subject on a number of occasions  of late.  My small thesis has been as follows.  Generally  speaking,  there  are  two  kinds of terrorism, one new, one old.  The new form of terrorism may be  called State-sponsored terrorism. It is  the kind we associate with the present  regime in Iran; it was almost certainly  involved in the bombing of our Embas sy and our Battalion Landing Team  billet in Beirut. As Clausewitz said of  war, it is merely an extension of diplo macy.  Congress,  by  legislation,  has  ac knowledged this phenomenon, and our  present statutes provide for the desig nation of states  involved with state  terrorism.  An older form of terrorism, more or  less a century old both here and in  Europe, is a form of violence directed  not by a  state but against a  state,  having as its object the overthrow or  transformation  of  the  regime  in  power.  I assume this was the nature of the  recent Senate bombing.  It was  the  nature of the bombing of the U.S. Mis sion to the United Nations when I was  Permanent Representative in 1975. It  is almost a daily occurrence  in  the  world.  If the object of this form of terror ism is understood, the response follows  logically.  The object is to change the constitu tional order of government,  in  the  large sense of the term. The response  should be to see that, no matter what,  this is not allowed to happen.  No nation has shown  this under standing with  greater  courage  or  greater success  in recent years than  that of Italy. The object of the Red  Brigades was to bring about a massive  repression that would kill the Italian  democracy. At great cost, but with per fect firmness, the people and the government of Italy declined.  So must we decline.  I believe I was the first Senator to  visit the Capitol after the November 9  bombing. It was election day, and I  was taking an early flight to New York  to vote and then return to the day's  session. On the way to the airport, I  stopped at the Capitol to inspect the  damage. Coming down the steps there after I was asked over by a group of  journalists who had not yet been al lowed inside the building. I described  what I had seen. I was asked what I  thought.  I  answered  simply:  ""They  can bomb the Capitol, but they cannot  bomb the democracy.""  Surely I was not wrong. But I would  be if as a result of that event we sud denly  restricted  the  free  informal  movement of members of the press in  the various hallways and lobbies that  surround the Senate Chamber. Not for  nothing were  the members of  the  Press Gallery in the House of Com mons once referred to as the Fourth  Estate. A constitutional status if ever  there was one.  To cut off access-free, spontaneous,  adventitious, and often calamitous between Senators and the accredited  members of the Press Gallery would  be to change our institution. It would  begin to cut us off from the people  who send us here. The only possible  advantage would accrue to the lobby ists who are sent here-well, not exact ly by the people.  May I ask that we reconsider this  matter and make no changes whatever  where  the press  is concerned. That  would give victory to our common, if  secret enemies, enemies, that is, of our  democracy.

57,Senate,98,-0.314,626,1,Mr. HUDDLESTON.," Mr. President,  I am pleased to report that the nation al commodity processing program es tablished by the Department of Agri culture on June 17, 1983, is being fa vorably receiv.ed by the private sector  and beginning to work in the manner  envisioned by Congress. During  the  first 6 months of the program, 46 na tional food companies applied for par ticipation.  Thirty-seven  companies  have been approved by  the Depart ment of Agriculture, nine applications  are pending, and only one company  has had its application denied.  The national commodity processing  program allows the Food and Nutri tion Service to ship USDA processed  and cheddar cheese, butter, nonfat dry  milk, rice, and honey directly to com mercial food processors for use in the  manufacture of processed foods. These  foods then are sold to eligible schools  and charitable  institutions at  lower  prices than reflect the value of the do nated commodities contained in them.  Mr. President,  I believe  that Con gress can, on balance, be pleased with  the  national  commodity  processing  program and the administration of the  program  by  the Department. The  Food and Nutrition Service  is  to be  commended for the effort it has made  in getting  a  new program off  the  ground. Food processors are partici pating, commodities are being moved  out of Federal storage, and recipient  agencies,  including school lunch pro grams throughout the country, have  an additional option on how to benefit  from U.S. agricultural surpluses.  In my judgment, however, it might  be possible to increase the amount of  dairy products being donated under  the national program if the Depart ment addressed  two  important ques tions.  The first question relates to the du ration of the program. Section 203 of  Public Law 98-8, which established the  commodity  processing  program,  re quires the Department to encourage  consumption of ""bonus"" agricultural  commodities, whenever they are made  available, through national commodity  processing agreements. Nevertheless,  when the Department issued its regu lations,  it interpreted section 203 of  Public Law 98-8 as ""encouraging proc essing agreements""  rather  than en couraging consumption on a perma nent basis ""whenever a commodity is  made  available without  charge  or  credit."" As a result, the program was  initiated  for only  a  limited period.  This has minimized the attractiveness  of the program to potential participat ing companies. I also recognize that  Congress, in extending section 203 of  Public Law 98-8-and other provisions  of  the Temporary Emergency Farm  Assistance Act of 1983-in Public Law  98-92, provided that section 203 would  terminate on September 30, 1985. The  Department, however, has authority  under other provisions of law to oper ate a national commodity processing  program on a permanent basis.

58,,98,-0.391,639,1,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Speaker, on  November 17  last year, I  joined with  Representatives  JIM MoAKLEY,  JoEL  PRITCHARD, BARNEY FRANK, TED WEISS,  JIM  JEFFORDS, ED TOWNS, and MIKE  LoWRY to introduce needed legislation  delaying the deportation of Salvador an nationals  residing  in  the United  States. Citizens  in El Salvador, par ticularly displaced persons,  are  the  first to be victims of violence. That vi olence comes not only from the ""death  squads,"" but  from a general break down of law and order: Essential serv ices  are not  available,  the  judicial  system  is nonexistent,  and  citizens  who become victims of the civil strife  637  have no safe haven to which they can  run.  Despite documented evidence of the  dangers in E1 Salvador, the Reagan ad ministration maintains a policy of de porting  Salvadoran  nationals  who  have  sought  refuge  in  the United  States. The Salvadorans who have fled  to this country fear the generalized vi olence inherent in civil war. They do  not ask for a new home here;  they  need temporary protection.  Staying deportation until Congress  determines that conditions in El Salva dor have reached a point that allows  the safe return of its citizens is a rea sonable approach to a dire problem.  All other North and Central American  countries now refrain from forcibly re turning  Salvadorans.  The  United  States should follow suit.  I would like to call to my colleagues'  attention an editorial from the New  York Times  in  support of  such  a  policy:  WHY POLES BUT NOT SALVADORANS?  talk  This is a story about a case of bureaucrat ic doubletalk, which  is harmless,  and a  double standard, which is not. The double is  ""extended  voluntary  departure,""  which means giving visitors to this country  a port in a sudden storm. The double stand ard  is  that the United States gives such  refuge to people from most of the world,  but not to people from El Salvador. Why  not?  There are refugees and there are refugees.  Some come here precisely to find a perma nent haven from persecution-Jews fleeing  Hilter in the 30's, boat people fleeing Viet nam in the 70's. But others come here as  visitors and are turned into refugees, while  here, by events at home. To force them to  return before the turmoil ends might be a  death sentence.  The Ugandans,  for example, who were  here  during  Idi  Amin's  bloody  last  days . . . or the Iranian students in colleges  across  the country when  the Ayatollah  came to power . . . or the Poles visiting in  this country when martial law was declared  in theirs ... or, now, the Salvadorans.  Some societies provide for temporary safe  haven by law. American law makes no such  provision but this country has evolved an in formal one, under the Attorney General's  prosecutory discretion: extended voluntary  departure. That means if you are in a class  of people found to need temporary haven in  an emergency, you can stay. Even if your  visa expires tomorrow morning, you have an  extra six months, say, to wait out the storm  back home, maybe longer.  For instance, if you are a Pole who was  caught here when martial law was declared  in your homeland in December 1981, your  extended voluntary departure deadline  is  about to be extended yet again, to Decem ber 1983. Over the years, the Government  has granted this kind of haven to other na tionalities,  too-Cubans, Czechs, Chileans,  Ethiopians, Nicaraguans, Ugandans and Af.  ghans. Why does this Administration refuse  to grant such safe haven to Salvadorans?  One explanation concerns danger. State  Department officials contend that the vio lence in El Salvador is not sufficiently in tense or widespread to justify extended vol untary departure. It's a puzzling argument,  coming just at the time the Administration  ",1984
59,,98,0.336,652,1,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Speaker, after  18 months of exhaustive study,  the  Presidential Commission  on Drunk  Driving has issued its final report-the  product  of  100  hours  of  hearings  across the country at which medical  experts,  law  enforcement  officials,  safety  authorities,  and  victims  of  drunk driving accidents testified about  the tragedy of drunk driving.  One of the Commission's key recom mendations: States should immediate ly adopt 21  years as  the minimum  legal purchasing and public possession  age for all alcoholic beverages.  In the last two Congresses, I have  sponsored a concurrent resolution ad vocating just this point. House Con current Resolution 23, which currently  has 83  cosponsors,  simply expresses  the sense of  the Congress  that all  States and the District of Columbia  should raise  the minimum legal age  for drinking and purchasing all alco holic beverages to 21.  House Concurrent Resolution 23  is  endorsed  by  the Departments  of  Transportation  and  Health  and  Human Services,  the Office of Man agement  and Budget,  the National  Transportation Safety Board and the  National Safety Council. It is support ed by Mothers Against Drunk Drivers  <MADD>. the American Medical Asso ciation <AMA>. the American Automo bile Association <AAA>.  the Interna tional Chiefs of Police, and numerous  health and insurance organizations.  This approach does not: establish a  Federal drinking  law, deny highway  funds to States which do not comply,  or provide incentive grants to States  which adopt 21.  It encourages  this  debate  to  take  place  in  individual  State legislative chambers, since tradi tionally the States have had jurisdic tion in the regulation of the sale and  distribution of alcohol.  Once again, I am asking for the sup port of my colleagues in the House in  what I consider to be the first step  Congress should take in establishing  21  as  the nationwide  legal age  for  drinking.

61,,98,0.231,652,1,Mr. BEREUTER.," Mr.  Speaker,  many in this country refuse to focus  their attention  to a  dangerous and  growing problem. While this country  awakens  from  a profound economic  slumber, developing nations continue  to struggle against high fuel prices,  spiraling  inflation, depressed export  markets, and unemployment.  Invest ment projects are heaping ruins of un finished construction, food stores are  being  looted and  the  small middle  class  is quickly disappearing. Mean while, conversion from military dicta torship  to a  true democracy will be  forced to pay over 10 percent of GNP  in debt repayments this year.  American commercial banks have re fused to accept a share of the burden  of a  longstanding problem which  is  partly of their making. Banks are in sisting on extremely high rates of in terest, which although quite profita ble,  create  enormous  pressures  on  Latin American governments. A Wash ington Post editorial of  last month  points out that Brazil is forced to pay  about 14.5 percent interest on its re scheduled loans. Our inflation rate is  now 3.4 percent yearly, making  the  real <nominal interest rate minus in flation> interest rate charged by banks  to Brazil about 10.7 percent. This is  far above a traditionally good rate of  return.  The editorial points out that when a  domestic company gets  into trouble,  January 26, 1981,.  bankers usually lower interest rates to  help  the  company  through  the  squeeze. That might squeeze immedi ate profits somewhat, but  it makes  good economic sense. Why,  then, do  not the banks apply the same ration ale  to  their beleaguered  customers  abroad? It would serve their own long term interests, as well as those of this  country and all other countries hoping  to grow and prosper in a healthy inter national economic environment. May  I, Mr. Speaker, commend this article  to my esteemed colleagues?  The article follows:  AMERICAN BANKS, LATIN DEBTS  In their  lending  to Latin America,  the  American commercial banks have not dem onstrated any great degree of either caution  or foresight. First they lent far more than  they intended. Now they are insisting on ex tremely high interest rates on those loans.  The present  level of  interest  is highly  profitable for the banks as long as it is paid.  But it is creating gigantic pressures in Latin  America  for moratoriums  and unilateral  action by Latin governments-action that  would disrupt not only the world economy  in general but the stability of the interna tional banking system itself.  The crucial case is Brazil, which currently  owes more than $90 billion. Of that, about  $63 billion  is  financed at  floating  rates.  Those rates are generally  two percentage  points above either the London interbank  rate, now about 10.5 percent a year, or the  New York prime rate, which is 11 percent.  That brings the average close to 13 percent  a year.  That's a swinging rate for debt that is de moninated in U.S. dollars, in which inflation  is now running about 5 percent a year. It  means that the real interest rate-the nomi nal rate minus inflation-is in the vicinity of  8 percent. That's four times the traditional  return on this kind of loan. In addition, the  banks have been charging a point and a half  in fees on each rescheduling. On the sub stantial part of the Brazilian debt that has  been rescheduled this year, that brings in terest currently to about 14.5 percent. The  Brazilians have fallen behind in payments.  Is that surprising?  One expert witness, Arthur Burns,  the  former chairman of  the Federal Reserve  and now American ambassador to Germany,  touched on the subject recently in talking  with reporters at the American Enterprise  Institute. Mr. Burns  observed  that  the  banks are not treating foreign governments  as they do domestic borrowers. When a do mestic company gets into trouble, its bank ers usually lower rates to see it through the  squeeze. They reason that it makes good  economic sense to sacrifice some interest in  order to save a customer. Mr. Burns won dered why the banks don't apply the same  logic to their customers abroad.  Some of the big banks argue that they  have to keep rates high so the smaller banks  will continue  to participate  in the loans.  That's open  to question. Some American  bankers also note that many of the loans to  Latin America come  from European and  Japanese banks. That's true, but irrelevant.  Any  leadership  is going  to have  to come  from the Americans.  Lower rates mean lower risks. Instead, the  opposite direction.

63,Senate,98,0.508,704,1,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. President,  the events surrounding  the publica tion of a court opinion  issued by a  Federal district judge in Denver, Colo.,  has been the subject of a number of  recent news accounts and editorials.  Briefly,  the  Justice  Department  sought and received a  temporary re straining order blocking publication of  an opinion rendered by Federal Dis trict Court Judge Winner. The fact  that  the Justice Department would  seek, and another Federal court would  grant such an order  is  remarkable.  But, the temporary restraining order  has not been revoked and the opinion  will be published in the near future.  However, in all this flap over the at tempt to block publication, we should  not  lose  sight of  the  larger  issues  raised by Judge Winner. In essence, he  is blowing the whistle on questionable  conduct of government prosecutors.  After reading Judge Winner's decision,  my first reaction was to call for hear ings  to shed additional light on the  issues raised in his opinion. I under stand that both the Federal district  court and the  lOth Circuit Court of  Appeals have different aspects of this  case under review. With that in mind,  the proper course may be to wait for  the  findings  from  these  hearings  before we begin our examination of  this matter and determine what action  Congress should take to insure protec tion against government misconduct.  In the meantime, I comment to my  colleagues  the following articles and  other accounts of this important issue:  [From the Denver Post, Jan. 27, 19841  JusTICE DEPARTMENT TRIES To GAG JUDGE  WINNER  <By William R. Ritz>  The U.S. Department of Justice, in a move  angrily derided as ""blatant  federal  arro gance"" and ""unshirted censorship,""  is at tempting to stop publication of an opinion  by a Denver federal court judge in which he  accuses three federal prosecutors of miscon duct.  The Justice Department's request for a  temporary restraining order quietly was ap proved by the lOth U.S. Circuit Court of Ap peals earlier  this month. The order bars  West Publishing Co. of St. Paul, Minn.,  from printing a decision by U.S. District  Judge Fred Winner in the Federal Supple ment, a hard-bound compilation of federal court decisions.  A  decision  by  the  appellate  court on  whether to make the order permanent could  come as early as this week.  But the decree could be anti-climactic be cause, whatever the outcome, the battle pit ting lawyers and civil  libertarians against  the Justice Department and appellate court  already will have been going strong.  At issue are three important constitution al points, say opponents of the restraining  order: prior restraint of the publisher, cen sorship of a federal judge, and the separa tion of branches of the government.  ""We're talking about a First Amendment  right of a judge to publish his opinion and  the Department of Justice  trying  to sup press that right, which we believe to be ab solute,"" said Richard Ruiner, one of the at torneys in tbe case.  ""Then you have a  separation-of-powers  problem with the executive branch trying to  ride herd over the judicial branch and pre vent  it  from  carrying  out  the  judicial  branch's rights and responsibilities.  ""It's astounding,"" he said.  ""When the indictment came down in 1982,  the Department of Justice  issued a  four page press release without worrying about  the reputations of the accused before they  had their day in court. Now, suddenly, they  are extremely worried about the reputations  of their attorneys . . . claiming they have  not had their day in court.  ""What's good for the goose is good for the  gander,"" he said.  <Glenn L. Archer Jr., the head of the Jus tice Department's tax division, said in an  interview with The New York Times that  the prior restraint on publication was neces sary because the ""slanderous"" judicial opin ion unfairly criticized three of his prosecu tors.  <Lawyers  involved in the case and other  legal experts said they knew of no previous  instance in which a private publisher had  been barred, on pain of contempt of court,  from publishing a judicial opinion.)  ""THIS IS A GAG ORDER""  If the restraining order is upheld, legal of ficials told The Denver Post, it could have a  chilling  effect  on  the  independence  of  American judges.  ""This is a gag order, pure and simple. It's  blatant federal arrogance,"" snapped lawyer  Donald E. Van Koughnet of Naples, Fla.,  ",1984

65,House,98,-0.334,743,1,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker,  as an  original cosponsor of H.R. 1961,  the  Agent Orange and Atomic Veterans  Relief Act, I rise in full support of the  legislation.  As chairman of the House Veterans'  Affairs  Subcommittee  on Hospitals  and Health Care and a member of the  committee since 1975, I can attest to  the  fact  that  the subject of agent  orange has been one of the most seri ous and persistent problems we have  faced.  In 1978, our colleague,  the gentle man from California, DON EDWARDS,  and I were the first members of the  committee to call for hearings on the  issue of agent orange.  We have, since that time, held at  least nine hearings reviewing scientific  data, and the concerns of veterans and  their families in attempting to reach a  consensus on the issue.  Where the scientific community was  uncertain as to the range of disabil ities which could be attributed to ex posure  to agent orange  in humans,  there was general agreement on three  basic points:  Dioxin  is one of  the most highly  toxic substances known to man.  Second, during a 10-year period from  1961 to 1971 approximately 52 million  pints of the herbicide were sprayed in  South Vietnam.  Third, there was a growing concern  among  the Vietnam veteran popula tion that not only their health, but  the welfare of their families had been  adversely affected by exposure.  The VA has conducted over 130,000  agent orange health screening exami nations.  Nearly 11,000 Vietnam veterans  in  my own State of Pennsylvania have  gone to the Veterans' Administration  for  examinations and agent orange  counseling.  During the 97th Congress the Con gress  approved our  legislation, now  law, Public Law 97-72 which provides  health care in VA medical facilities for  veterans who have disabilities which  could be associated with exposure to  agent orange and ionizing radiation.  Based on far less evidence than this,  last year, the present administration  awarded $33 million  to relocate  the  families of Times Beach, Mo., who  only may have been exposed to dioxin  in the soil around their homes.  On these precedents and further sci entific evidence it only seems appro priate that we move forward at this  point with the presumptions for com pensation for three specific diseases:  Chloracne-a  skin  condition,  por phyria cutanea tarda-a liver disorder,  and soft tissue sarcomas.  In the same vein, our committee has  attempted to deal with the residual ef fects of exposure to ionizing radiation  among the ""Atomic Veteran"" popula tion. Between 1945 and 1963 the U.S.  Government exploded approximately  235 atmospheric nuclear devices. Ap proximately 200,000 American service  personnel were exposed to ionizing ra diation during that time, or during the  clean-up operations in Hiroshima and  Nagasaki. Again, as with  the agent  orange question, there has been dis agreement in the scientific community  as to the exact disabilities brought on  by varying degrees of radiation. But  still, the existing evidence was strong  enough to warrant, at a minimum at  this time, a presumption of disability  for three specific diseases: Cancer of  the  thyroid,  polycythemia  vera-a  bone disease, and  leukemia  if  those  disabilities appear within 20 years of  exposure.  Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that we  have taken an important first step in  bringing this bill to the floor. It does  not go as far as the bill we originally  introduced nor does  it include addi tional means of requiring that the VA  submit  additional  disabilities which  could be compensable as a result of ex posure to these environmental hazards  that was contained in an amendment  before the committee. There are many  of us on the committee who are also  concerned that the presumptive peri ods called for, for both Vietnam veter ans and atomic veterans, are unreal istically short. Still, the bill is a begin ning, and the House, at least, is taking  this important first step in behalf of  those who have served their country  and now seek our help.  I would like to express my deep ap preciation  to  the  gentleman  from  South Dakota, the original author of  this legislation, TOM DASCHLE for his  persistence and his dedication to this  issue.  I would also like to thank the leader ship  of  the  committee, Chairman  MONTGOMERY,  and Ranking Minority  Member JOHN PAUL HAMMERSCHMIDT  for their leadership and willingness to  compromise to seek this solution.

67,House,98,-0.455,743,1,Mr. FAZIO.," Mr. Speaker, today we  are considering  legislation  that will  provide a measure of relief that is long  overdue for the thousands of veterans  suffering from illnesses attributable to  agent orange and atomic radiation ex posure.  ',I'hese veterans provided our country  with patriotic service under hazardous  conditions. Indeed, the full extent of  the hazards faced by Vietnam veterans  exposed to toxic herbicides containing  dioxin, such as agent orange, and who  suffer from illnesses linked to that ex posure  is not yet fully known. Like wise, veterans who served in the occu pation forces in Hiroshima and Naga saki immediately following World War  II and those who have since participat ed in atmospheric nuclear tests were  serving in the midst of hidden dangers  that are only now coming to light.  This legislation, which provides dis ability benefits  to  these veterans or  their survivors, is only the first step  we must take to insure that this type  of hazard is never faced by our service  men and women in the future. There  is a growing concern and interest in  Congress to find out all we can about  the potential health effects of expo sure  to nuclear radiation and agent  orange-both manmade environmental  hazards of military service. These vet erans served  their country  in good  faith and honorably fulfilled their ob ligations. With  the passage of H.R.  1961 Congress can demonstrate that  we will not tum our backs on our re sponsibilities to those who served their  country at a great personal sacrifice.  ",1984

70,House,98,0.46,756,1,Mr. BARTLETT.," I thank the gentle man for yielding.  I have a good deal of respect for  both the chairman of the committee  and  the ranking Republican on  the  subcommittee but I rise to oppose this  bill, H.R. 2878, and I do not rise to  oppose libraries. I support libraries in  this country.  Libraries in this country are funded  at the current rate at the local level of  approximately  $1.5  billion  a  year.  What I oppose, Mr. Chairman, is the  refusal of this Congress in bills such as  this,  including this bill,  to prioritize  Federal programs and Federal spend ing as to what is the most appropriate  and the best use of Federal funds.  We have a widespread availability of  quality libraries and widespread avail ability throughout the country. And  that is important. But I oppose the ex tension of $684 million in additional  spending over the next 4 years.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose the bill pri marily because of  its perpetual  life  feature. Should this bill pass perhaps  we should title it, instead of its cur rent title, we should title it the Perpet ual Federal Spending Program Act of  1984. I think we should examine what  this act would purport to do. I believe  the chairman and the gentleman from  Missouri eloquently gave us reasons  not to reenact this act and pass this  bill, because at best, this program over  the past 25 years has already accom plished its mission. Beginning 25 years  ago, this House, this Federal Govern ment set out to assure the availability  of  libraries  throughout  the country  and we have largely accomplished that  with libraries available in 96 percent  of  the communities  in  this Nation.  Those  libraries are  locally  adminis tered and locally funded, and their pri orities are locally set. Ninety-five per cent or more of all funds for libraries  in this country, $1.5 billion annually,  come from  local needs and we need  quality  libraries. But  that  quality  should be built in at the local level. So,  it is a case of a misson has been at tempted, beginning 25 years ago, and  the mission has been largely accom plished. But at worst, Mr. Chairman,  at worst this is a case of a Federal pro gram which is unnecessary, redundant  and costly, a Federal program which  has assumed a life of its own.  Now,  certainly one could make a  case that some of the funds in this bill  will do some good. There are few Fed eral programs that cannot make that  case. But what the country is asking  us to do, what the American people  would have us do in 1984 is to priori tize the spending of American taxpayers' money and  to say  is  this $684  millon the best use of those funds? We  just passed a bill on agent orange, Mr.  Chairman. which over a 4-year period  would expend $30 million. and I would  ask who among us would say that Fed eral aid to libraries is 20 times more  important  than dealing with  agent  orange?  I would  ask  this Congress  today  to make a  real case  for  the  future, a future of the continued re covery, a future of increasing employ ment and decreasing inflation and de creasing  interest  rates.  I would ask  this Congress  to  think about, very  carefully,  the last recession that we  have just gone through, the recession  that was caused by excessive nonprior itized spending of  this body, and  I  would ask us to take steps to avoid  that next recession.  Mr. Chairman, $180 billion deficits  are not created in the aggregate. At no  time does a bill's sponsor stand here or  in the well and ask for this House to  pass $180 billion expenditure and label  that expenditure deficit. No, sir. The  Members of this body bring that $180  billion to us one bill at a time, one act  at a time, $1 billion in one, $5 billion  in another; sometimes  they ask  for  $684 million. But it is the cumulative  effect of each of those pieces of legis lation, of each of those perpetual Fed eral programs that cause that deficit.  And the risk, and the effect then, is  not so much that there is red ink on  the budget or  that  it shows up  in  someone's campaign expenditure. The  result is in the lives of real American  families who  cannot  find  jobs,  are  thrown out of work. The result of this  bill and others like  it,  the result of  this lack of prioritizing responsibility  is that more Americans are thrown out  of work  and more  senior  citizens  cannot cope with inflation and more  young  families  are  unable  to  buy  homes. I noted the cries last week that  the White House  should  somehow  show sincerity in making a downpay ment on the deficit. It is now Congress  opportunity  today with  this  legisla tion,  to show  that sincerity  to  the  American  people,  to  prove  to  the  American people and to ourselves, that  we are serious about a deficit, that we  are serious about avoiding the next re cession, that we are serious about the  future, we are able to prioritize.  The President likes to make remarks  to this effect, and his favorite quote is:  There is nothing so immortal in the histo ry of the world as the perpetual life of a  Federal program.  And this act.  today. is evidence of  those words.  I  urge  this House  to  prove that at least there is one Feder al program that does not have to be  immortal,  that  it can be sunsetted,  that we can say we have accomplished  our goals and we will prioritize public  spending of Federal dollars.

73,Senate,98,0.382,834,1,Mr. HATCH.,"  I  have  consistently  supported S. 1762 and commend each  of the sponsors who have worked dili gently to bring this vital legislation to  the floor of the Senate. As an ardent  supporter of any legislation to address  our crime  crisis,  I  am enthusiastic  about the prospects of enacting these  important reforms, Nonetheless I feel  that the improvements this bill makes  in the insanity defense do not suffi ciently reform this area of the law.  In the wake of the extensive media  coverage of the Hinckley assassination  attempt and  trial,  the public outcry  for changes  in  the  insanity defense  has been clear and sustained. Unfortu nately I fear that the reformed stand ard for the insanity defense in S. 1762  may have also acuitted Mr. Hinckley.  Under  the standard currently  in S.  1762, Hinckley would have to be ac quitted if he ""was unable to appreciate  the nature and quality or the wrong fulness of his acts.""  Mr. Hinckley alleged  in  trail and  supplied psychiatric testimony to bol ster his contention that his delusional  relationship with an actress prevented  him from appreciating the nature and  quality of his act. The breath and am biguity of the term ""appreciate,"" still  a part of the current S. 1762 provision,  allowed Mr. Hinckley to escape culpa bility  for deliberately attempting  to  kill the President. The jury was per suaded  that his behavior was suffi ciently aberrational  to prevent him  from  appreciating  the  nature  and  quality of his murder attempt. The  former  president  of  the American  Academy of Psyciatry, Dr. Abraham  Halpern, analyzing the Hinckley case  in light of the ""appreciation"" test, also  concluded  that  the  test  in S. 1762  would be likely to acquit Hinckley if  he were retried under its standards.  It is important for the Congress to know  that under the insanity rules proposed in S.  1762, the trial of John Hinckley would have  taken the same course and ended with the  same verdict as it did under the American  Law Institute rule employed in the court in  which he was tried. The same members of  the  faculty  of Harvard Medical School  would have testified that he was ""severely  mentally ill and that ""brain scans show that  his brain is slightly shrunken and has more  folds and ventricles than is usual in people  his age."" The same University of Maryland  professor of psychiatry would have told the  jury  that Hinckley suffers from ""process  schizophrenia, a disease marked by a very  severe and very grave course."" The same  Yale University psychiatrist would have tes tified that Hinckley has a major ""depressive  disorder, borderline schizophrenia and para noid personality disorder"" The same Dis trict of Columbia psychiatrist would have  informed the jury that the defendant had a  ""Schizotypal personality disorder with re gression under stress to psychosis."" Thus all  the defense experts would have testified as  they did in the actual trial, that Hinckley  had a severely abnormal mental condition  that grossly impaired his understanding of  reality rendering him unable to appreciate  the wrongfulness of his conduct. It is evi dent that the rule proposed in S. 1762 to  ""narrow  the  insanity defense"" would do  nothing  to  lessen  the  tarnishing of  the  public sense of justice engendered by the  typical insanity trial in federal courts.  Dr. Halpern's conclusion is bolstered  by the experience of New York State  which has had a test remarkably simi lar to that found in S. 1762 for the  past 20  years. Under  that  test, ap proximately 100 defendants-primari ly accused of violent offenses-have  been acquitted by the insanity defense  each  year. Nationwide,  over  1,000  yearly escape conviction by pleading  insanity.  Under my amendment, however, Mr.  Hinckley could not be acquitted. My  amendment would  not  allow Mr.  Hinckley to argue that his apprecia tion was impaired. With regard to in sanity, Hinckley could only argue that  he lacked the state of mind require ment, the mens rea, necessary for of fense  of  attempted murder.  Since  Hinckley actually intended to kill the  President, an act he  referred  to as  ""historic""  in one of  the  letters he  wrote prior to the attempt, he would  have been guilty of the offense. Hinck ley admitted in his trial that he in tended to kill the President, but con tended that he ""lacked substantial ca pacity to appreciate"" the wrongfulness  of his acts.  Under my amendment, the exhaus tive pyschiatric  testimony presented  by Hinckley would have been irrele vant to the question of guilt. It would  have been, however,  relevant to the  question of sentencing. This alterna tive to insanity reform would have al lowed a separate hearing entirely on  the subject of Hinckley's mental con dition prior to sentencing. The judge  could then have modified Hinckley's  sentence  to  insure  that he  received  proper treatment. This alternative is  not harsh. It insures that someone al leging mental impairment gets both a  chance to assert that the mental ill ness prevented him from committing  the crime and the chance to receive  hospitalization and appropriate  sen tencing for the nature of the impair ment in the event the illness did not  impair his intent to commit a crime.  John Hinckley  deliberately  chose  the only  six  exploding  (devastator>  bullets he had from among 37 other  bullets when he  loaded his  pistol.  With the specific intention of killing  the President, he went to where he  knew the President would be and, in  full  view  of  the American  public,  almost succeeded in accomplishing his  purpose. He did severely wound the  President  and  three other persons,  some of whom are not likely to ever  return to the same quality of life. This  event is primarily responsible for our  effort to reform the insanity defense.  Under  the  current  bill,  Hinckley  would, in all likelihood, still be acquit ted. Under my amendment, Hinckley  would most certainly be convicted. At  the very least, we should insure that  our effort today is sufficiently effec tive to change the result in the Hinck ley case.  Generations of Federal judges have  struggled to define the circumstances  under which mentally abnormal of fenders should be held responsible for  their conduct, without notable success.  As Dr. Abraham Halpern, the distin guished psychiatrist, has noted, ""in sanity has come  to mean anything  anybody wants it to mean.""  The  traditional  insanity defense  is  both a  legal anachronism and a con cept ill-suited to modern psychological  theory. It presents issues-important  issues-that are not susceptible of in telligent resolution in the courtroom  environment. Trials in which the in sanity defense has been raised have  often degenerated into swearing con tests  between  opposing  teams  of  expert witnesses,  all  of whom  are  forced to translate the language of the  psychiatric profession  into the quite  alien language of the legal profession.  It is this attempt to marry these two  incompatible disciplines that has cre ated the current confusion.  The insanity defense evolved princi pally as a means by which English ju rists could avoid-in a legally rational  mann.er-the  discomfiture  of  con demning to death a felon who was so  mentally deranged that his execution  would affront ordinary moral sensibili ties. As Lord Erskine stated in the ear liest years of the 19th century, ""delu sion ... is the true character of insan ity.""  Individuals  suffering  in  this  manner could not truly be considered  ""responsible"" in the legal sense.  Although the criminal law over the  years  substituted  imprisonment and  lesser penalties for capital punishment  and substituted judicial discretion for  mandatory penalties, the insanity de fense, as an exception to the ordinary  consequences of criminal conduct, sur vived the former strict legal require ments which it has been designed to  avoid.  Even within the psychological com munity, the insane asylum, which once  served as a warehouse for the crimi nally insane, has become just a brief  steppingstone back to the street.  In the United States, the Congress  has never enacted legislation on the  insanity defense. Its development has  largely been left to the courts, particu larly the courts of appeals. The foun dation of the present defense was laid  down in M'Naghten's case <8 Eng. Rep.  718 <House of Lords, 1843)) in which it  was statedTo establish a defense on the ground of  insanity, it must be clearly proved that at  ",1984
74,Senate,98,-0.314,873,1,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, I should  like to respond briefly to the Senator  from Maryland regarding his amend ment.  Although  this  amendment  affects  the intent of Congress, it is impossible  to predict with certainty whether or  not the prison population will increase  at any time in the future because of  these new guidelines. For example,  what  if  there  is a  sudden  large  in crease in terrorist activities? What if  there is a sudden large increase, such  as we had in the 1960's, with respect to  violence on campuses, or any number  of things that are affected by trends  that occur in this country?  Should persons,  for example, who  are involved in terrorist activities-and  I want to make it clear that I am not  making a comparison between terror ism and what happened on the cam puses  in  the 1960's, because  that is  where  I was  in  the 1960's-should  those persons who otherwise would be  imprisoned be  released  to accommo date  terrorists because  there  is  an  influx of terrorism?  If the new guidelines, on their face,  would result in a net increase in the  prison  population,  Congress  could  reject  them and ask  the Sentencing  Commission to draft new ones, more in  line with  congressional  intent,  and  Congress could face up to the issue of  what it is going  to do about prison  size.  The  amendment,  though well-in tended, is too vague. From what point  in time will aggregate terms or average  terms be determined? Does  inmate  population include persons detained in  State institutions, in halfway houses,  or on furlough?  Mr. President, there is a consistency  to all  the amendments  the Senator  has offered. If you accept his basic  premise, they all have compelling rea sons to be adopted. But I do not think  the basic premise on which the Sena tor  from Maryland  is proceeding  is  that sound, which is that, automatical ly, prison population will increase and  that this lack of discretion on the part  of the judges will produce this hemor rhaging new statistic.

78,Senate,98,-0.347,886,1,Mr. MITCHELL.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to introduce legislation today  which I believe has both practical and  symbolic importance to this country's  energy policy. Specifically, I am pro posing legislation to amend the Home  Energy Assistance Act to allow States  to use up to 25 percent of funds dis tributed under the low income energy  assistance program for weatherization  in accordance with the Department of  Energy's present weatherization pro gram.  This proposal would  impose abso lutely no new  requirements on  the  States, would require no new appro priations or funding, and would not es tablish any new programs. Rather this  legislation merely allows the States to  determine  the most effective use of  moneys Congress has already appro priated,  thereby strengthening  their  ability  to meet the energy needs of  low-income  families  and  individuals  under  the Home Energy Assistance  Act.  Both weatherization and fuel assist ance are designed to meet the same  overall  goal;  that  is,  to help  low income  families  cope with  today's  energy problems. I firmly believe, Mr.  President, that the most effective and  commonsense way of  insuring  that  this goal is met is to give States-who  are  far more  familiar with  their  energy needs than the Federal Gov ernment-flexibility  to use  the pro grams together.

79,,98,0.319,938,1,Mr. CORCORAN.," Mr. Speaker, a  January 9 Wall Street Journal article  by Alan Bayless reports that the out look for energy pricing may provide  good news  indeed. Mr. Bayless dis cusses  the predictions of Mr. Arion  Tussing, an economist who has com piled an impressive record in the past  few years for accurate forecasts in the  area of energy pricing. The article fo cuses on gas, but also discusses oil,  coal,  and electricity, particularly  in  connection with U.S.  imports  from  Canada.  For  the benefit of our colleagues,  Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in  the REcORD  the  text of the Bayless  January 9 Wall Street Journal article.  [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 9, 19841  NATURAL-GAS PRESSURE BUILDS TO A HEAD  <By Alan Bayless)  VANcouvER.-Arlon Tussing,  a maverick,  50-year-old economist, has compiled an im pressive record in the past few years for ac curate but controversial  forecasts  in  the  volatile world of energy pricing.  In the fall of 1980, for example, he pre dicted correctly that international oil prices  were peaking, even though the world-wide  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  consensus was for a continuous and rapid  upward spiral  throughout  this decade. A  year  later, U.S.  gas  pipelines put  their  future in peril by ignoring his criticism of  the trend toward high-priced and inflexible  gas-purchase contracts with producers.  ""The most fashionable slogan in the in dustry may soon be 'I can't take and I won't  pay. So sue me,' "" he and colleague Connie  Barlow told a meeting of energy economists  in November 1981. Within 18 months,. the  prediction came true as Tenneco Inc. and  Columbia Gas Systems Inc. reneged on huge  domestic purchase contracts. More recently,  Panhandle Eastern Corp. suspended its 20year contract  to buy expensive  liquefied  natural gas from Algeria.  These days, Mr. Tussing's Seattle-based  consulting business is booming, even though  he rejects the popular wisdom that recent  sluggish energy prices will stabilize or begin  rising with continued economic growth and  cold weather.  Instead, Mr. Tussing confi dently  predicts  that  inexorable market  forces will keep forcing down these prices  for 10 years. Canada could play an impor tant role in the price decline because it has  so much excess energy to sell in the U.S.  GAS OVERLOOKED  Mr. Tussing's forecast stems in part from  his analysis of natural gas, a  fuel usually  overlooked in favor of oil when energy price  trends are examined. In the past, the over sight has been justified, largely because gov ernment regulation made gas-price analysis  unnecessary in the U.S.,  the world's most  important energy market.  But major structural changes are creating  a powerful and competitive U.S. gas-price  market for the first time. The overall, long term energy-price decline will be caused by  a  growth  of  this  competition,  not  just  within the gas industry but between gas and  other fuels, Mr. Tussing says. The impact  on natural-gas pipelines could be particular ly painful as they leave their risk-free, regu lated environment.  On the surface, the forecast may appear  ridiculous, because consumer gas prices are  continuing to soar despite a gas-supply glut.  In fact, a recent study by the U.S. Energy  Information Administration says consumers  can expect to pay 10% more for gas during  1984 even though oil prices won't change  much. But Mr. Tussing expects  these  in creases to be transitory, because they result  not from market pressure, but from errors  the gas industry committed after decades of  federal price controls were amended by the  Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.  Almost overnight, the new law eliminated  the gas shortages of the mid-1970s by creat ing more market flexibility and by allowing  certain limited categories of gas to be sold  at very high prices. The gas industry, how ever, continued to expect the reappearance  of shortages. Those ingrained expectations,  which haven't fully disappeared, led produc ers to discover and pipelines to contract for  too much of the newly decontrolled sup plies. At the same time, the pipelines also  invested far too much in new transportation  systems  for expensive Canadian, Mexican  and Algerian gas.  Because old gas prices had been kept so  far below their market value, the pipelines  combined  the expensive  and  inexpensive  gases and transmission rates and passed the  increasingly higher average price on to their  customers. But the price boosts have infuri ated gas users, creating a hot political issue.  In 1983, the Reagan administration pro posed to resolve matters with an unprece dented  law  that would void existing conJanuary 30, 1984  tracts between gas pipelines and producers  and permit free negotiations for new and  presumably lower average wellhead prices.  Some congressmen, on  the other hand,  want to extend existing price controls and  force a price rollback in time for the 1984  election. If neither side can muster enough  votes, as seems  likely, all gas discovered  since 1978 would be decontrolled next Jan. 1  under the 1978 law, while older gas would  remain controlled until the wells run dry.  The last alternative has raised fears that  average wellhead  prices  and  consumer  prices will be forced up even more. That is  because many existing contracts allow de controlled-gas producers to charge the high est possible rates and because the cushion ing effect of inexpensive older gas is gradu ally disappearing.  But Mr. Tussing doubts that prices can  rise much more, because gas already costs so  much  that users are  conserving,  closing  down or switching  to cheaper fuels. The  process is creating a ""death spiral"" for some  interstate pipelines and  local distributors  because the increased cost of transporting  smaller amounts of gas in tum causes even  more of a decline in demand, he says. To re verse the spiral, pipelines are being forced  to change tactics and negotiate a competi tive ""spot market"" price for users that could  switch fuels. This, says Mr. Tussing, will  quickly lead to a two or three tier gas-user  market and even a gas-futures market tied  to spot prices.  The first  tier would  involve households  and other small buyers, providing a base  level of long-term demand. It would contin ue to require regulatory protection because  such gas users wouldn't have the clout to  negotiate prices.  Big industrial customers would make up  the second tier. Because of their ability to  bargain with pipelines for the cheapest sup plies, they wouldn't require any regulatory  protection. The third tier would involve the  growing  ""contract  carriage"" market,  in  which producers sell directly  to end-users  and then buy the cheapest available trans portation.  Mr. Tussing argues  that regulators are  more  likely  to foster competition than to  prevent it, because, in any event, they can't  stop energy users from seeking the lowest cost supplier. ""A little bit of competition is  subversive.  It spreads  like a  cancer,"" he  says. The competition leads him to forecast  that  some  pipelines  eventually will  be  forced to seek Chapter 11 protection from  creditors under U.S. bankruptcy  laws be cause he doubts the marketplace will for give past errors.  ""Manville Corp. and Continental Airlines  have shown how permissive U.S. bankruptcy  laws can be used as a business strategy,'' he  says. ""Even if pipelines are showing good  profits, they may have to use the same tool  to get out of their contracts.""  The faster regulators allow the competi tion to grow, the faster Mr. Tussing expects  a weakening not just in gas prices but in  such gas substitutes as oil, electricity and  coal. All four energy sources are in excess  supply at current prices, he asserts. The  international oil price, of course, depends on  the ability of the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries to maintain production  at levels far below capacity and far below  the needs of most of the cartel's members.  Mr. Tussing expects continuing pressure on  OPEC to force down the price in the spring.  Less well  known  is Canada's growing  desire to sell cut-rate electricity to the U.S.,  even though some of the power may replace  ",1984
80,,98,-0.316,951,1,Mr. GORE.," Mr. Speaker, I am de lighted  to  join with Congressman  GLENN ANDERSON  to  introduce H.R.  4616 a bill to improve child passenger  safety.  Over the last three decades we have  seen the death rate for preschool chil dren decline by 53 percent. Virtually  all of this decline resulted from a 62percent reduction in death rates from  medical illness. In contrast, the rate of  child passenger deaths remained un changed. Highway death is  the only  major cause of death for these chil dren  that has not declined.  In fact  today it is the single leading cause of  death of children. For this reason I be lieve we must immediately recognize  that highway deaths and injuries are  the number one public health threat  that all our children face.  The bill we are introducing provides  a program to meet this challenge. It  encourages  each State  to  combine  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  their wisdom and expertise in adminis tering programs within their State to  put forth a child passenger safety pro gram that will work best in that indi vidual State.  Last session  I  introduced  the bill  H.R. 3483, the Child Highway Safety  Act. While I continue to believe the  concepts embodied in that legislation  are  those  that we must ultimately  strive for, H.R. 4616 represents an im portant first step on that road.  The Federal Government's interest  in protecting the Nation's children has  a long and successful history. Federal  dollars have been well spent for State  programs  in maternal  and  child  health, nutrition, primary care, and  immunizations. The combined Feder al/State programs in these areas have  resulted in the significant decline of  deaths due to medical illness I cited  earlier. We must now turn our atten tion to motor vehicle safety and put  an end to the senseless and easily pre ventable  tragedy of so many of our  children needlessly dying on our high ways.  I have a special interest in this legis lation  for  two  reasons: First,  as  a  father of four young children I have a  special empathy for families who have  had to suffer the death or crippling  injury to a child involved in a motor  vehicle accident; and second, this bill  builds upon the hard work of many of  my fellow Tennesseans, as Tennessee  was the first State to enact a law re quiring  the use of child safety  re straints 7 years  ago.  I  particularly  would like to note the efforts of Dr.  Robert Sanders, Dr. Sam Carney, Dr.  Ed Caldwell, and Mr. Edward Casey.  Mr. Casey of Nashville, Tenn.,  first  had  the  idea  for a  child passenger  safety law back  in 1975. Dr. Robert  Sanders of Murfreesboro, Tenn., with  the help of his wife Pat and Drs.  Carney and Caldwell, worked tirelessly  to see that vision realised.  Through an act that has truly dem onstrated  unique  dedication,  they  have taken Mr. Casey's idea and today  deserve the thanks of all of us for the  great strides that have been made. Be cause of the overwhelming success of  Tennessee's child highway safety law,  40 other States plus the District of Co lumbia .have passed similar laws man dating the use of child restraints by  preschool children.  Hearings on this legislation will be  held before the Subcommittee on Sur face Transportation following the Feb ruary district work period. I am hope ful and optimistic that with the broad,  bipartisan  support  this  legislation  enjoys, it can become law before the  end of year.e  949  HAS THE ARMS RACE BEEN  ONE-SIDED?  HON. LEE H.

84,House,98,-0.026,1081,1,Mrs. SCHNEIDER.," Madam Chair man, I rise today in support of H.R.  2878,  the Library Services and Con struction Act  amendments. Though  the numbers are small when compared  to the whole budget, the benefits pro vided to every American are incalcula ble. Since  its  inception in 1957,  this  legislation has greatly contributed to  the expansion of  the public  library  system throughout our Nation.  Libraries have ceased being simply  places where books are kept. Over the  years they have become valuable com munity service centers, assisting Amer icans of all age groups. From personal  experience, I know that my State of  Rhode  Island and  its citizens have  benefited  immensely  from  this pro gram. Some of the activities supported  through  this Federal  assistance  in clude: Resource sharing between local  libraries-this concept prevents a du plication of efforts and resources and  assures that each dollar is spent with  maximum efficiency; a  regional out reach service for the blind and phys ically handicapped-last year  alone,  some 2,500 Rhode Islanders were as sisted through this program; and ma terial  and  programing  services  for  State  institutions,  among  them  the  adult correctional institution, various  veterans homes, and State hospitals. I  could go on, but the important fact  that I want to highlight is that our  public libraries have become an inter gral part of the lives of Americans and  this program assists  in meeting  the  needs of these various groups in our  population.  Once again,  I want to express my  support for this valuable program and  urge my colleagues to support a con tinuation of funding for this legisla tion. Thank you.e  e ",1984
85,House,98,-0.516,1081,1,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Madam  Chairman, I  rise  in support of H.R.  2878,  the Library Services and Con struction Act Amendments of 1983.  While LSCA has been and continues  to be one of the most efficient and  cost-effective Federal programs, these  amendments make  several  improve ments which will allow the program to  serve more diverse populations and  will place libraries on the cutting edge  of  the new  information  technologies  that are overtaking almost every facet  of business, commerce, and education.  Specifically,  the LSCA  amendments  will focus  the program on providing  access  to  library services  to a wide  range  of populations  including  the  handicapped,  elderly,  and  bilingual  populations; redirect the concept of li braries  from  being  repositories  for  books to being community information  centers providing a wide range of serv ices  to  the public; provide direct  li brary services  to  Indian  tribes  that  have formerly received no library serv ices; increase the emphasis on interli brary cooperation; expand and provide  increased funding for library construc tion and renovation purposes; and pro vide grants for libraries that wish to  provide literacy training programs or  foreign language materials.  Many  of  the  changes  that  are  brought about in the amendments to  LSCA are directly tied to the Nation's  economic, education, and employment  well-being. It is in the best interest of  the country to adopt this legislation so  that libraries can continue to function  to help communities throughout the  Nation.  As an example of how LSCA has  worked, let me tell you about the ex periences in my home State of Michi gan.  In Michigan, LSCA is helping librar ies to link together electronically and  share their resources,  thus effecting  economies,  extending  service,  and  making the most efficient use of ex pensive  library materials. Through  LSCA assistance with the initial hard ware required or the processing of cat aloging data, libraries are enabled to  participate through the Michigan li brary consortium in a nationwide bibli ographic data base, the Online Com puter Library Center <OCLC).  For  very small libraries this process may  be the first time they have profession al bibliographic control of their own  collections, plus it gives them access to  the holdings of many kinds of Michi gan libraries, and if needed, to count less other libraries across the country.  However, recent telecommunications  developments may raise  the cost of  the private phone line system linking  Michigan libraries to these computer ized data bases by 76 percent  this  April, according to the latest figures.  With such a drastic jump in costs so  imminent,  the  continued  support  through the library services and con struction act is essential. We should  not  hit  libraries  with  a  double  whammy; we should support the bill  before us, H.R. 2878. For the Upper  Peninsula of Michigan and for many  other sparsely populated  regions  in  the United States, telecommunications  is the only reasonable way to extend  adequate  library  service  to all  resi dents. But the libraries can not do it  alone, and if we expect them to coop erate across State lines, it is appropri ate  that we  assist  them  through  LSCA.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.   e ",1984

Mr. Speaker,  I want to thank our  colleague, the gentleman from Wiscon sin (Mr. KASTENMEIER), for his appro priate remarks and for asking for this  special order.  Mr. Speaker, when I learned of the  sudden  and  tragic  circumstances  which  struck  down  Congressman  CLEMENT ZABLOCKI,  I knew  that our  home State of Wisconsin had lost the  senior and most distinguished Member  of  its congressional delegation. The  country  lost an able  individual who  was chairman of the House Committee  on Foreign Affairs and on so very  many occasions faithfully represented  the best interest of the United States  to leaders around the world.  I felt a certain kinship to Congress man ZABLOCKI. Both he and I served  on  the Foreign Affairs Committee.  Many times both he and I had similar  views on international events. Both he  and I were alumni of Marquette Uni versity in Milwaukee.  the  Those of us who had the privilege to  serve with him understand the diffi cult and complex task which he so art fully performed. How many times was  our former chairman asked to mediate  a dispute between other ranking mem bers of our committee or to settle a  matter of legislative jurisdiction. How  many time did Congressman ZABLOCKI  place his loyalty to his country and his  President over partisan politics and  the course of political expediency?  These were  the marks of a great  chairman-a chairman who sought to  deal fairly with all the members of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs wheth er they be Democrat or Republican.  I know that many people in Wiscon sin felt a personal loss with his pass ing. They remember him because he  never forgot his roots and maintained  a fierce loyalty to protect the interests  of his constituents. We all can appreci ate and can participate in the great  issues of  the day-national security,  foreign  policy,  international  trade,  human rights, world hunger, and the  many other special problems which af flict each region of our world.  Congressman ZABLOCKI was part of  all of these issues. Either directly, or  indirectly  through his subcommittee  chairman, he played a role in world af fairs.  But the Congressman never forgot  his constituents. He never forgot the  elderly who needed heat in the winter,  the lost social security check, the par ents of a would be student who needed  help in the Washington bureaucracy  to find the right office to apply for a  student loan.  It  is  impossible  to  estimate how  many people  in Wisconsin benefited  from Congressman  ZABLOCKI  repre senting them in the U.S. Congress. On  this  score  alone  he was  a  great  Member of this body.  But his abilities and special gifts car ried him to greater heights. The coun try is grateful and so are we that his  even hand helped guide the ship of  state.  Many  centuries  ago,  Ecclesiastes  wrote about a time for war and a time  for peace, a  time for reaping and a  time  for  sowing. Congressman  ZA BLOCKI's time came when we all wished  he could have remained with us. His  memory will be blessed.  0 1620  The country lost an able individual  who was the chairman of our Commit tee on Foreign Affairs, and on so many  occasions  faithfully  represented  the  best interests of the United States not  only here on the floor but also around  the floor.

On April 20, 1983, the Committee on Edu cation and Labor considered H.R. 2461, the  Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1983.  During' the markup session, the Committee  Chairman, Representative Carl Perkins, of fered an amendment affecting certain pro gram authorizations. His amendment was  intended to increase particular program au thorizations to the target levels contained in  the first budget resolution for fiscal year  1984 <H. Con.

99,,98,-0.153,1172,1,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  joining with HAL SAWYER, the ranking  Republican on the Subcommittee on  Crime, to introduce today the Danger ous Drug Diversion Control Act of  1984.  This  bill  is  the  administration's  package of substantive and technical  changes in the Controlled Substances  Act  and  the Controlled Substances  Import and Export Act which affect  the way  that potentially dangerous  prescription drugs are handled and  distributed by manufacturers, distribu tors, pharmacists, and physicians.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Last summer, the Subcommittee on  Crime examined the very large prob lem of the abuse of dangerous pre scription  drugs.  In  1982,  close  to  100,000 Americans of all ages went to  hospital emergency rooms because of  their reaction to controlled substances  of this type, which are only lawfully  obtained by a  doctor's prescription.  That number was  just about  three  times the number of people who went  to emergency rooms because of heroin,  cocaine, marihuana, and LSD. Accord ing to the Federal Government's drug  abuse warning network, 75 percent of  the drugs identified in drug abuse re lated deaths reported by various medi cal examiners were prescription drugs.  Abuse of  these drugs, obtained and  used outside the scope of responsible  medical treatment, is the most devas tating and widespread aspect of the  drug abuse epidemic.  These potentially dangerous drugs  are abused because the system of legal  controls for them is circumvented in a  variety of ways. It was made clear at  that hearing that improvements in the  existing system of legal controls are  called for.  The bill which we are  introducing  was drafted by the administration and  transmitted to Congress in 1983 by the  President as part of a very large pack age of  suggested criminal  law  revi sions. We are concerned about  the  problem of  the diversion  of  these  drugs, and therefore we are introduc ing the President's ""Diversion Control  Amendments""  in order  to allow  fo cused public and congressional consid eration of this part of the administra tion's package of suggested  improve ments.  We did not develop  these amend ments, and we are not at this time en dorsing or passing  judgment on any  particular provisions in this bill. Our  purpose is to place before the House  these proposals to address drug diver sion problems which the administra tion has  identified. These proposals  were favorably reported by the Senate  Judiciary Committee on July 21, 1983,  as part B of title V of S. 1762.  The bill  that we  are  introducing  today is what the President submitted  and the Senate Judiciary Committee  has reported except for the correction  of obvious typographical errors, draft ing errors, and inadvertent omissions  of a strictly technical nature.  The subcommittee has scheduled its  first hearing on  this  legislation  for  February 22, 1984. We look forward to  hearing  from  the public,  from  the  health care and pharmaceutical indus tries, from the law enforcement com munity, and  from specialists  in  the  problems of drug abuse for their comments and  suggestions. As  the evi dence that I cited earlier makes plain,  this is a major component of the crisis  of drug abuse our society is now con fronting. We are going to examine, iniJanuary 31, 1984  tially in the context of the changes  that the administration has proposed,  all of the issues in the system of legal  control of prescription drugs that are  subject to abuse, and proposals for im provement.  Those who wish  to participate  in  these hearings should contact counsel  Eric Sterling, Subcommittee on Crime,  207 Cannon House Office Building,  Washington, D.C. 20515, <202)  2251695.  I ask unanimous consent that at this  point in the REcoRD,  I may insert a  brief description of the provisions.  SECTION-BY -SECTION ANALYSIS  Section 1 is the short title, the ""Danger ous Drug Diversion Control Act of 1984.""  Subsection  <b>  explains  that  sections  2  through 13 are amendments  to  the Con trolled Substances Act  and  sections  14  through  22  amend  the Controlled Sub stances Import and Export Act.  Section 2 adds a definition of the term  ""isomer"" and amends the definition of the  term ""narcotic drug"".  Section 3 grants to the Attorney General  the authority  to  schedule or  reschedule  drugs on an emergency basis. This would  provide a headstart on the procedure now  used  to  schedule  controlled  substances  which frequently takes up to a year.  Section 4 expands the authority of the At torney General  to exempt  from  control  compounds, mixtures or preparations  in  three categories: exempt over-the-counter  preparations, exempt prescription prepara tions, and exempt chemical preparations.  Section 5 modifies the length of time for  which a  registration for a practitioner  is  valid. Currently all registrations must be re newed  annually. This amendment would  allow the Attorney General to issue regis trations for up to 3 years for practitioners.  In 1979 DEA estimated that this change  could save $700,000 annually.  Section 6 amends the requirements of reg istering practitioners who dispense or con duct research  in controlled substances  to  allow the Attorney General to deny a regis tration on broader, public interest grounds  than currently allowed, and provides five  factors  to be weighed  in determining the  public  interest.  this bill also  includes the  last sentence of subsection <f> which was in advertently omitted in the President's sub mission and was not included in S. 1762.  Section 7 is an amendment similar to that  in section 6 which allows the Attorney Gen eral to suspend or revoke a registration to  manufacture, distribute or dispense upon a  finding that the registrant has committed  acts which would render the registration in consistent with the public  interest as de fined in section 303<f> <21 U.S.C. 823<f» as  amended in section 6 of this bill.  Section 8 is intended to give the Attorney  General the authority to take custody of  controlled substances  in circumstances  which a registrant ceases practice or goes  out of business, or of the controlled sub stances of a registrant for which the regis trant's registration has expired.  Sections 9 and 10 together rewrite the rec ord.keeping  exemptions  for  practitioners  who administer or prescribe controlled sub in  stances in the lawful course of their practice  in section 307<c><l> <A> and <B> <21 U.S.C.  827<c><l> <A> and <B». Clause <A> currently  applies to the prescribing or administering  of narcotic controlled substances. Section 9  ",1984
100,House,98,-0.247,1198,1,Mr. WALGREN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of  H.R. 2465 the significant earthquakes  that hit in south-central Idaho on Oc tober 28 killing 2 children and in Coa linga, Calif. on May 2, and the memo ries of over 6,000 people who died in  fires last year make the case for strong  national programs to reduce the haz ards associated with earthquakes and  fires. This bill seeks  to maintain an  adequate earthquake prediction pro gram and enhance  the Federal  fire  prevention and control effort.  Title I authorizes appropriations for  the national earthquake hazards  re duction program. For fiscal year 1984,  this bill authorizes $3.705 million  to  the Federal Emergency Management  Agency <FEMA>  for a number of ac tivities including planning and coordi nation, improvement of seismic codes,  to promote hazard awareness among  State and local governments, and dis seminate information; $35.524 million  to the U.S. Geological Survey <USGS>  for earthquake hazards and risk as sessment,  earthquake  prediction,  global seismology, and the operation  of seismic engineering programs; $27.3  million to the National Science Foun dation <NSF) to conduct fundamental  studies, earthquake engineering, and  policy research; and $475,000  to the  Center  for Building Technology, at  the National Bureau  of Standards  <NBS) to conduct research and devel op standards in the seismic design and  construction of buildings. For  fiscal  year 1985, each authorization level is  increased by 5 percent.  For  the earthquake program,  the  total authorization level for fiscal year  1984  is $67,004,000  this amount will  provide sufficient funds  to  the U.S.  Geological Survey for prediction and  monitoring of  the San Andreas and  other  faults  and  to  the National  Bureau of Standards to reinstate the  seismic codes and standards effort at  the Center for Building Technology.  Under this bill, we will maintain the  current  level of  research on earth quakes and the current level of moni toring networks.  The bill authorizes $475,000 to rein state the seismic standards effort at  the Center for Building Technology at  the National Bureau of Standards.  The committee disagreed with the ad ministration's proposal  to  eliminate  the CBT in the fiscal year 1984 budget  request.  The Center  for  Building  Technology is the only Federal organi zation with expertise on earthquake  engineering required for improvement  of  seismic  design  and  construction  practices.  The U.S. investment in construction  is at a rate of $230 billion per year,  with better than half of that in seis mic regions. A report by the National  Research council ""Earthquake Engi neering Research-1982"" Termed the  present U.S.  effort  in  earthquake  hazard  reduction ""inadequate."" Esti mates have been made that 3,000  to  23,000  fatalities will occur when the  next  catastrophic  earthquake  hits  California. Most of the deaths and in juries would occur because of the fail ure of manmade structures.  The Coalinga earthquake is real evi dence of the need for improvement in  seismic design and construction prac tices. Estimates of  total damage  in  Coalinga have been placed at $30 mil lion. All of the 2,500 homes  in the  town were damaged  to some degree  and 5 percent were left uninhabitable.  On the other hand, the strong quake  that rocked Idaho October 28, 1983,  caused no major structural damage to  recently  constructed  buildings  in  major cities. These buildings were con structed to withstand a seismic event.  However,  some older buildings near  the earthquake epicenter were crip pled. Two children were killed in Chal lis, a town near the epicenter, when a  storefront collapsed on them.  The Federal Government clearly has  an  important role  in sponsoring  re search  and  development  to  reduce  earthquake losses.  Title  11  authorizes  appropriations  for  the Federal  fire prevention and  control program. The total authoriza tion level  in this bill for fiscal year  1984 is $17,720,000 to FEMA to carry  out the programs at the U.S. Fire Ad ministration  <USFA>  and National  Fire Academy. For fiscal year 1984,  this total is $3 million above the ad ministration's request. The $3 million  increase  includes $1 million  to U.S.  Fire Administration  to enhance  fire  prevention education programs at the  State and  local  level for  individuals  who are particularly vulnerable to fire  hazards-the  elderly,  handicapped,  and minorities. Also, $1 million to U.S.  Fire Administration to promote tech nology  development  programs-such  activities as  low cost residential  fire  prevention systems; and methods of  testing fire alarms and fire protection  devices without interruption everyone  in the process; and $1 million to the  National Fire Academy to improve in formation exchange through satellite  and regional dissemination efforts.  The committee found a critical need  to improve public education programs  and to disseminate information to the  fire service community. Title 2 of this  bill seeks to do this and maintain cur rent fire prevention and control pro gram activities at the U.S. Fire Admin istration and National Fire Academy.  For fiscal year 1985, the authorization  level is increased by 5 percent.  The full magnitude of our national  fire  problem  is  difficult  to  grasp.  Annual deaths due to fire are roughly  equal to having two jumbo jets crash  in midair every month. Fire mostly  kills people in one's and two's in their  homes-this is  less newsworthy, even  though  the annual death  total  (ap proximately 8,000) is nearly 20  times  that  of  tornadoes,  hurricanes,  and  floods combined. Twenty-four people  each day die in fires. The flames are  not the principal killer-inhalation of  deadly  smoke and gas  accounts  for  more than 80 percent of all fire fatali ties. This is an alarming epidemic.  Mr. Chairman, we believe that the  programs authorized in this bill are ef fective  investments  in  preventing  greater life and property losses that  will happen if we fail to make these in vestments now. We realize that this is  a  tight budget year, but given  the  threat to  life and property and  the  very real potential to mitigate the dis asters, we urge favorable consideration  and passage of H.R. 2465.

101,House,98,-0.318,1211,1,Mr. FLORIO.," Mr. Speaker, on Janu ary 22,  1918,  the Ukrainian people  threw off the yoke of repression and  declared their independence. This for mation of the Ukrainian National Re public 66 years ago signified an impor tant step in the history of the Ukraini an people as  they have struggled to  assert their identity and their beliefs  while  under  foreign  domination.  I  would like to join with my colleagues,  DON RITTER, SAM STRATTON, and WIL LIAM  BROOMFIELD,  in  their  special  order to bring this memorable date to  the attention of the Congress.  Though 66 years have passed since  this declaration, the memory of this  day still lives on in the hearts of all  Ukrainians. Out of the ashes of the  Russian  and Austro-Hungarian Em pires,  the Ukrainian people  rose  in  1918 and took the opportunity to real ize the dreams of their forefathers in  declaring  their  independence. From  the first, the new nation struggled to  hold on to its new-found freedom, bat tered by Russian armies from the East  and Polish armies from the West. De spite a valiant effort,  the Ukrainian  National Republic was crushed by the  Communist Russians in the summer of  1920, 3 years after its formation.  The Ukrainian people have suffered  66 years of repression and persecution  at the hands of Soviet aggressors since  their  declaration  of  independence.  They have been imprisoned and tor tured because of their political and re ligious beliefs and the doors of their  churches  and  schools  have  been  closed. Furthermore, an unwarranted  attempt was made by the Soviets to  eradicate an entire culture and race.  During 1932 and 1933, 7 to 10 million  Ukrainians starved to death because of  Stalin's cruel collectivization program  which  resulted  in  a  devastating  famine. The causes and effects of this  famine are still not fully known be cause  the Soviet Governme.nt  sup pressed  any  information  about  the  famine. Because this famine formed a  crucial chapter in the history of the  Ukrainian people and in an effort to  help Ukrainians throughout the world  regain a part of their past, I have in troduced legislation, H.R. 4459, which  would establish a congressional com mission to study the Ukraine famine  of 1932-33. Since H.R. 4459 was intro duced,  60  of  our  colleagues  have  deemed  this effort worthy of  their  support and have agreed to cosponsor  the measure. I urge the rest of my col leagues to support this bill as well and  to work with me in securing passage of  this bill.  Despite famines and persecution, de spite the curtailment of their civil lib erties, and despite the injustices that  they  have  been  subjected  to,  the  Ukrainian people continue to display  courage and perseverance and have  not yet given up hope that, one day,  they too will breathe the air of free dom. We must continue to remember  this momentous  declaration  in  the  hope  that our remembrance of  this  glorious moment will lend the Ukraini an people  the  encouragement  that  they need. As the famous Ukrainian  poet Taras Schevchenko  said,  ""Our  souls will never perish, freedom knows  no dying."" May the hope for freedom  for the Ukrainian people never die and  may their quest for independence be  successful.e  e ",1984
102,House,98,0.227,1211,1,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, I  wish to extend my thanks to Congress man RITTER  for his  fine efforts  in  making  this commemoration of  the  66th Anniversary of the Ukraine's in dependence possible.  I am honored to have the opportuni ty  to  pay  special  tribute  to  the  Ukraine  and  the aspirations of  its  people on this important occasion.  Because of its strategic geographical  position  and  rich  resources,  the  Ukraine has always been regarded as a  coveted prize of aggressors from the  Mongols to the Moscovite czars and,  more  recently,  the Soviet Govern ment.  With the 1917 disintegration of the  Russian autocratic government, and  the Ukrainian  declaration  of  inde pendence, the Ukrainians demonstrat ed to the world that Moscow and Kiev  represented two different nations and  two different mentalities. Kiev repre sented the democratic concept of gov ernment  based  on  the  respect  of  human  rights, while Moscow  repre sented totalitarianism and destruction.  After the Ukrainian declaration of  independence,  they  fought valiantly  but unsuccessfully to keep their inde pendence for four terrible years. Since  the occupation of the Ukraine by the  Soviet Government, over 10 million  Ukrainians have died in the defense of  their country.  Today, we pause to pay special trib ute to the brave men and women of  the Ukrainewho are carrying forward.  ",1984
103,House,98,0.255,1224,1,Mr. MOLINARI.," I thank the gentle man from New York, <Mr. WEISS), for  yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to join my  colleagues in this bipartisan effort to  request  the  emergency  aid  for  the  people who are dying throughout the  world, particularly in Africa.  Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentle man <Mr. WEISS) for bringing on this  special order because time is running  out and I think it is important that we  do seek to get a concentration of the  Congress on  this very, very urgent  issue. I believe it is our moral obliga tion to do all that we possibly can in  order to alleviate the great suffering  being endured on  the continent of  Africa. The  latest supplemental  re quest  is part of a  series of actions  taken by the administration to address  this critical problem and I applaud the  decision  announced Monday  to  in crease assistance.  The famine in Afr""ica  is a result of  drought whic.h began in 1982 and con tinues to seriously affect food produc tion. The problem is intensified when  combined with a lack of favorable gov ernment agricultural policies, an  in ability to cover food deficits by com mercial imports as a result of a dete rioration of their balance of payments,  and the prevalence of animal disease.  Civil strife inhibits food aid distribu tion and encourages the migration of  refugees,  thereby placing more of a  strain on the governments of the af fected nations.  It is my belief that the United States  is  trying to respond both effectively  and efficiently to this crisis. I had the  opportunity of witnessing  this  first hand when I attended the Food and  Agriculture Organization Conference  held in November of last year. The Af rican crisis was one of the dominant  issues of the Conference and I  think  all 156 countries in attendance realized  the critical importance of addressing  this problem. Secretary Block, as head  of the U.S. delegation, reinforced our  aid commitment by announcing that  the United States was pledging $25  million in direct emergency food aid.  The announced increase was in addi tion to a previous $25 million increase  in  emergency  food  aid  for Africa,  which brought  the amount of  total  food and agricultural aid to the conti nent  to $550 million for 1983. Once  back home, I was pleased to hear of  the  January  announcement by  the  Agency for International Development  that $32.7 million  in new funds was  being allocated for the African crisis.  Finally, as you know, on Monday Sec retary Shultz announced a request for  an  emergency  appropriation of $90  million which would allow for 200,000  metric tons of food aid.  In my contact with AID during the  past 2 months, officials freely acknowleged that more emergency aid would  be necessary based on their actual and  projected requests from African coun tries for food aid. It is evident that, in  terms of  this situation, our Govern ment has a consistent pattern of in creasing aid as the facts warrant. I en courage the administration to contin ue to be receptive to future needs.  Mr. Speaker, I think it important to  note  another  announcement which  was made Monday by Secretary Shultz  aimed at addressing  long-term solu tions to the hunger of Africa. I was en couraged to hear of the proposed in centive program which would award  governments willing to alter their poli cies in favor of agricultural programs.  Only through these types of programs  will we be able to insure that a repeat  of this crisis does not occur. This pro posed program deserves our careful at tention in the coming months.  Each day we hear stories of personal  human suffering with very little hope  of  imminent  relief. Certainly,  facts  now warrant that this Congress seri ously study a supplemental appropria tion for Africa.  I have been  told  if  emergency  requests are not met by  April or May, it may be too late. It is  our responsibility to quickly and favor ably enact a supplemental appropria tion.  I would like to add at this point that  it might be appropriate  that  today  when we have heard so much discus sion about budget deficits and there  has been such great emphasis on both  sides of the aisle  today in attacking  the budget deficits that this country  has been known as a country with a  big heart and although we may have  problems in dealing with the deficits  that we have in this country, we will  not close our hearts and our minds to  the problems of the truly needy, par ticularly  those  starving  and  dying  throughout the world.  I thank the gentleman for bringing  on the special order and for allowing  me to participate in this very humani tarian effort.  ",1984
104,House,98,-0.564,1224,1,Mr. WEISS.,"  I  thank my  distin guished friend from New York for his  very important contribution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle man from Texas <Mr. LELAND).  I  thank  the gentle man from New York <Mr. WEISS) for  allowing me to share a little bit with  him this time on this very, very impor tant issue.  The gentleman and I had the privi lege of going to Africa in August and  saw some incredible things as far as  the starvation problem there. We were  in Africa for 21 days. It was a most in valuable experience as far as  I was  concerned.  I thank the gentleman for providing  this time and providing the American  people with an opportunity  to learn  more about what  this  is all about.  Each year 15 to 20 million people die  ",1984
105,House,98,-0.596,1224,1,Mr. LELAND.,"  worldwide as a result of hunger and  malnutrition. That is 40,000 people a  day, 28 every minute. Of the 28 who  will die in the next 60 seconds, 21 will  be children.  Nowhere is the situation more devas tating than in Africa. Estimating that  150 million Africans are chronically  hungry,  the United Nations warns  that 24  impoverished African nations  face severe food shortages this year  where drought, civil war, and blights  have exacerbated already overwhelm ing circumstances. In late 1983, Minis ters from eight Sahel countries met  with donor countries and international  institutions and agreed that corrective  action since 1976 has been insufficient;  and the once treasured goal of achiev ing food self-sufficiency has become  an unrealistic objective for the fore seeable future. Of the 26 specifically  designated poorest countries  in  the  world, 24 are in Africa.  While in Africa last summer, I was  taken to one of the many feeding sta tions  in Ethiopia where  emergency  food rations are distributed. I cannot  even begin to describe the deprivation,  pain, and hopelessness I saw  in the  eyes of the people frantically clustered  around the station hoping for the mir acle of food. Tragically, much of the  seed for next year's plantings has even  been eaten out of desperation. It is es timated that 75 to 100 people, mostly  children, die each day  in Ethiopia.  Three million  people  are  currently  threatened by starvation. The knowl edge of global tragedy of hunger was  made disturbingly vivid  for me as I  looked  at  those  sick  and  forlorn  people. A lengthy, grueling civil war  has taken its toll on the population,  and can  take  responsibility  for  the  bogged down efforts by relief organiza tions to distribute food, medicine, and  agricultural supplies through increas ingly  perilous,  almost  nonexistent  transportation routes.  Much of Africa  is  facing  unsur mountable  problems, making  their  escape from  the poverty cycle seem  elusive  at  best.  Shrinking  revenue  bases,  limited  resources, declines  in  cultivatable land, unchanging climatic  conditions, and, considerable economic  sacrifices have resulted in many coun tries' efforts  to eliminate  their bal ance-of-payments deficits. Even with a  sudden surge of aid dollars, most Afri can nations are unlikely  to  recover  from  the  staggering conditions  fos tered by the severest drought  in 10  years. While starvation is obviously no  stranger to the people of Mozambique,  Ghana, Ethiopia, and Mauritania,  it  would appear to me, Mr. Speaker, that  the United States  should officially  urge that immediate steps be taken by  international  agencies  to  determine  comprehensively the populations now  facing, or will  imminently be facing  outright starvation.

118,,98,-0.135,1393,1,Mr. ANDREWS of Texas.," Mr.  Speaker,  the most  pressing  issue  before Congress today is the growing  Federal deficit. If the deficit is not re duced,  interest rates will soar. This  means that young couples will not be  able to buy their first homes; senior  citizens will see  their savings erode;  small businesses will be unable to get  loans at rates they can afford; people  will be thrown out of work.  The cumulative postwar debt com piled  by  all  the  Presidents  from  Truman to Carter amounts to $477 bil lion.  Since  President Reagan  has  taken office the debt has increased by  $560 billion. Not only  is  this  larger  than the total postwar debt accumuEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  lated over the past 35 years, but the  projected deficit for next year will be  around $200 billion for the third year  in a row. This means that the current  administration will have added more  to the Federal debt in 4 years than all  the previous Presidents from George  Washington  to  Jimmy Carter  com bined.  What has caused this huge increase  in the debt and produced the annual  $200  billion  deficits  of  the past  2  years? In testimony before the House  Budget Committee, Martin Feldstein,  Chairman of the President's Council  of Economic Advisers said:  The things that raise the deficit are de fense  spending,  interest on  the national  debt and tax reduction.  Feldstein also stated:  I think the most important thing to em phasize is that the problem is not this year's  deficit, but a projected string of deficits out  into the future. The most direct measure of  the effect of that string of deficits is what it  will do to the national debt. We would see  over the next 5 or 6 years the national debt  rising by about $1,000 billion, about $1 tril lion.  The annual Federal deficit is like a  loan. When you or I need extra money  to buy a house or a car we take out a  loan to cover the cost of that purchase  because it exceeds what we can afford  on our monthly income or one year's  wages. That loan will be paid off over  a period of years  to  the bank that  loaned us the money. We will also pay  interest on that loan, and until we pay  off the loan the money we borrowed  will be part of our debt. If we take out  more loans our debt will increase.  The same is true of the Federal defi cit. The deficit represents the amount  of money the Government spent in a  single year that was greater than the  amount  that it earned.  In order  to  cover  the  deficit  the Government  must borrow money from banks, and  the total amount of that loan is added  to the debt we already owe.  Eventually, if a person takes out too  many loans, the debt they accumulate  will exceed what they can afford to  pay-even over  the  long  term-and  they will go bankrupt. But when the  Federal Government  takes out  too  many loans, it does not go bankrupt.  Instead, it borrows more money from  the bank. This means that there is less  money for businesses to borrow.  This year the Federal Government is  borrowing 75 percent of  the money  available for capital investment. That  means all the businesses in America  are competing for the other 25 percent  of the available funds, and this situa tion causes interest rates to soar.  There  are  several  proposals  and  ideas  to deal with  the deficit. One  short-term solution which I strongly  support is the pay-as-you-go proposals  introduced by Representative GEORGE  MILLER. This proposal  is  simple:  It  states that before the President and  Congress can initiate any new spend1391  ing programs,  they must have  the  money  to pay  for  them.  In other  words, if Congress wants to spend $10  million on a new program, it must first  identify $10 million of savings else where in the Federal budget that will  pay for the program, or generate $10  million in new revenues. This proposal  would also cover budget increases for  existing Federal  agencies  and  pro grams.  The  pay-as-you-go  budget  would stop the growth of the annual  deficit and would begin the reduction  process.  But we must also begin to find ways  of reducing the deficit over the long  term. The only way to accomplish this  is by developing a bipartisan consensus  on deficit reduction;  the Democratic  leadership has been trying to encour age  this for months. A start toward  this goal has already been made. Last  year a  group called  the Bipartisan  Budget Appeal, made up of prominent  business  and  finance  leaders,  and  former  government  officials,  was  formed. It called for a multiyear com mitment to deficit reduction with the  emphasis on fairness in spending cuts,  the need to increase revenue, and the  importance of stimulating new busi ness investment.  Recently, the Washington Post car ried an editorial by four Governors  calling for deficit reduction. The Gov ernors-two  Republicans  and  two  Democrats-called  for  a  bipartisan  effort to make hard political choices in  order to deal with the deficit. They  suggested restructuring the growth of  entitlement  programs  and COLA's,  limiting the growth of defense spend ing and raising taxes. They recognized  that while these proposals are politi cally unpopular, the only other alter native is an endless stream of $200 to  $300 billion in annual deficits-which  would mean all Americans would have  to save $2,000 to $3,000 more each year  and loan it to the Federal Government  to keep the Government afloat.  For the past 2 years, several Mem bers of Congress, most notably Demo crat Representative JIM JONES, have  been  trying  to get the President  to  focus attention on the central problem  of the deficit. Therefore, I was encour aged when President Reagan,  in his  State of the Union Address, joined in  these efforts in calling for a bipartisan  effort between both Houses of Con gress and the administration to reduce  the deficit. I hope that his speech will  be followed by meaningful proposals  and not by more rhetoric.  Mr. Speaker, we must learn to pay  for what we want as a  society, and  stop mortgaging our future, and the  future of the next generation of Amer icans. We must learn to think about  not only what we want, but what we  can afford.e  ",1984

120,House,98,-0.058,4,6,Mrs. LLOYD.," Mr. Speaker, I  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 2484, which designates the air  traffic control tower at Lovell Field in  Chattanooga, Tenn.,  as  the  ""Harry  Porter Tower.""  Harry Porter is one of the oldest li censed pilots  in the Nation and has  been flying since 1923. Since that first  flight, he has had a unique and varied  career and has become a  symbol of  aviation history to the people of Chat tanooga. Mr. Porter served as a flight  instructor in World War II,  training  thousands of pilots to fly military air craft during  that period. Later he  served as an  inspector for  the FAA  and at one point even worked for the  Internal Revenue  Service,  locating  stills hidden in the woods.  It is appropriate that the air traffic  control tower at Lovell Field be named  after Harry Porter since so much of  his life has been spent at this aviation  facility. He operated his own business  at Lovell Field from 1932, when the  field opened, until 1967, when he sold  his firm. He still maintains an office  there as well as a position as adviser  and consultant to the present owners.  Harry  Porter  has  had  a  distin guished career and has been awarded  many honors  including  the coveted  Amelia Earhart Medal. He will soon be  celebrating his 90th birthday in Chat tanooga where he still resides with his  wife, Eunice. His 89th birthday has  not stopped him though. He regularly  flies about 5 hours a week. I look forthank  LLOYD,  ward  to my  visits  to  his  facilities  where a warm welcome and a word of  encouragement greets me.  In view of his accomplishments  in  the field of aviation, and his contribu tion to aviation I  think it only right  that we name the air traffic control  tower  at Lovell  Field  after Harry  Porter and  I urge my colleagues  to  support this measure.  ",1984
121,House,98,0.26,4,6,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Speaker, I  join  my colleagues in supporting H.R. 2484  which would redesignate the air traf fic control  tower at Lovell Field  in  Chattanooga, Tenn.,  as  the  ""Harry  Porter Tower.""  Harry Porter, who began flying  in  1923, is one of the oldest active pilots  the United States, who not only  served his country in World War I, but  again  in World War  II when  he  trained many of our military pilots.  During his notable  career, he  also  served as an FAA inspector and has  been awarded many honors, including  the Amelia Earhart Medal  for  his  major contributions to aviation.  Lovell Field in Chattanooga is the  fourth  largest commercial facility  in  the State of Tennessee and, in light of  Mr.  Porter's  continuous  presence  there for over 50 years,  it would be  most fitting if the airport tower was  renamed in his honor. In addition, the  city commission of Chattanooga has  unanimously  requested  that  this  honor be bestowed on Mr. Porter.  As is the usual practice with legisla tion of this nature, H.R. 2484 includes  language which will assure that the  FAA will not be required to change  any air traffic control procedures or  republish  any aeronautical  informa tion which refers to the tower as the  Chattanooga Tower.  For  these  reasons,  I urge my col leagues to support H.R. 2484.e  e ",1984
122,House,98,0.312,17,6,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, as one who  has advocated pharmacy crime legisla tion since  the 96th Congress,  I  am  pleased  to  support  this  legislation  which will see to it that our Nation's  pharmacists, and indeed all DEA regis trants, have  the Federal protection  they must have if they are to continue  dispensing necessary drugs  to  their  customers with any sense of security.  I particularly want to commend the  distinguished chairman of  the Sub committee on Crime, Mr. HUGHES, and  HAROLD SA WYER,  ranking Republican  on the subcommittee, for their efforts  to resolve many questions which arose  during  consideration  of  legislation.  The HUGHES' bill, H.R. 5222, is a good  bill, and one which I feel deserves my  colleagues' unanimous support.  Those who have devoted consider able time and effort to this issue over  the years fully recognize the delicate  balance which exists-and which must  be maintained-if we are to see legisla tion signed into law in this Congress.  As we all know, politics is the art of  compromise, and nowhere is that more  evident than in the legislation before  us today.  In addition to expressing my sincere  thanks  to  Chairman  HUGHES  and  HAROLD SA WYER,  I also want to par ticularly thank subcommittee counsel,  Hayden Gregory and Eric Sterling.  Charlene Van Lier, Republican coun sel for the subcommittee, has provided  outstanding advice and counsel. Par ticularly  helpful  and welcome  has  been the support, encouragement, and  well-reasoned suegestions by the Na tional Association  of Chain Drug  Stores and  the National Wholesale  Druggists Association.  Last but certainly not least, I wish to  thank  those of my  colleagues who  have steadfastly cosponsored  legisla tion on this issue which I have intro duced in the last two Congresses. It  was their continued support since the  96th Congress which  provided  the  strength  to  continue  the  fight  on  behalf of those throughout the coun try  who  dispense  controlled  sub stances. I am convinced that their sup port has been crucial in our efforts to  provide  an  appropriate Federal  re sponse  to a  rapidly  increasing prob lem.

123,House,98,-0.398,30,6,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker,  4  years  ago,  then  candidate Ronald  Reagan asked the voters to ask them selves, ""Are you better off than you  were 4 years ago?"" It is time to ask the  question again. And if you are not a  member Gf  the superrich among us,  the  answer,  despite  the President's  protestation of an overwhelming eco nomic recovery, is a resounding ""no.""  It may come as a  surprise to hear  this. After all,  the administration  is  claiming  that  unemployment  has  taken a downturn, inflation has sub sided, and retail sales are  increasing  throughout  the Nation. These  facts  are all true. But when put in the 4year perspective,  the changes in the  economy do not appear to equal much  of an accomplishment. Reaganomics,  contrary to what the President would  have us believe, has failed to produce a  significant  recovery. The only ones  who are receiving significant benefit  from  the  administration's programs  are the superrich, and they are getting  richer.  The administration's tax program,  for example, was hailed as the first  step on the road to economic recovery.  The question is: Economic recovery for  whom? Published studies have shown  that the benefits gained from recent  Federal  tax  reductions  rise substan tially with the amount of household  income  recorded.  Under  current  policy,  the richer you are now,  the  richer you  are going  to be  in  the  future.  The view that the economy  is  im proving for the country as a whole is  supported only in comparisons of the  current figures to the administration's  own previous economic performance.  For example, in January 1980, the un employment rate was 6.2 percent. By  November 1982, as a result of the im plementation of  the administration's  policies, the unemployment rate had  risen to 10.7 percent. When the Presi dent claims the current rate of 7 .8 per cent is a great accomplishment, I am  skeptical. The fact is that the unem ployment rate was 6.2 percent when  the President  took office, and now,  over 3 years into his term, that rate is  7 .8 percent. That does not sound like a  wonderous  achievement  to  me.  I  wonder how  the administration can  claim an improvement in the economy  rate  for  taking  the  unemployment  from 6.2 to 7.8 percent.  This  is  like buying a used bicycle,  letting it deteriorate, and then trying  to sell it as new. The Reagan adminis tration is attempting to convince the  American people that the economy is  operating  effectively.  Luckily,  the  American people know enough about  the state of the economy to recognize  when economic  indicators are being  manipulated before their eyes. Present  policies help  those who need  it the  least-the  extraordinarily  wealthy  Americans at the top.  Economic  recovery  is  a misnomer  when only the richest members of the  population see any evidence of eco nomic improvement. When unemploy ment is reduced to meaningful levels,  when  inflation  is  truly  lowered, and  when retail sales remain at high levels,  then let the administration claim vic tory over the Nation's economic woes.  Comparing the current economic indi cators to those in 1980, and consider ing the present problems, it is difficult  to see how current policies are success ful in meeting the economic concerns  of all Americans.e  CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R.  4072  Mr. DE LA GARZA submitted the fol lowing conference  report and state ment on the bill <H.R. 4072> to provide  for an improved program for wheat.

124,Senate,98,-0.598,56,6,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, the  Senate will shortly be called upon to  commit the first $150 million for the  planning of an orbiting civilian space  station. This relatively small first step  of funding will lead to one giant leap  into a  highly questionable program  which may ultimately cost the taxpay ers $20 billion or more over the next  15 years.  Two recent articles cogently argue  the folly of moving forward on this  NASA-instigated  outer  space white  elephant.  Thomas Gold, a professor of astron omy at Cornell Center for Radiophy sics and Space Research at Cornell  University,  convincingly argues  that  such a space station would indeed be a  misstep for mankind because it would  divert funds from cheaper but scientif ically  more  important  unmanned  space projects.  Mark Washburn, writing in yester day's Washington Post, expands upon  Dr. Gold's ~omments. He points out  the tremendous costs of providing life support and redundant safety systems  for manned space flights.  Since unmanned space craft can do  just about all  the  tasks a manned  space craft can but at a considerably  lower price and also perform many sci entific experiments beyond the ability  of manned space craft, I am at a loss  to  understand  the need  to hastily  spend  tens of billions of dollars on  NASA's outer space version of a gigan tic public works project.  I urge my colleagues to read the arti cles by Tom Gold and Mark Wash burn, and  I  ask unanimous consent  that these articles be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the arti cles were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From Newsday, Mar. 20, 19841  SPACE STATION-A MISSTEP FOR MANKIND  <By Thomas Gold)  When, in 1957, the space age began with  the launching of the Soviet Sputnik, it fired  the imagination of people all over the globe.  To most people it was a vindication of sci ence fiction, a victory of ""far-out thinking""  over  the dreary and unimaginative. Here  was  the  first  step  accomplished  of  the  ladder of science-fiction achievement, whose  later rungs are manned flight around the  solar system and then even to the stars.  All these things had been predicted and  been said to be impossible. Who was not to  say  that  they could not all be done? It  seemed that the courageous thinkers were  right and the timid would perish in ridicule.  This dream world was the very real back ground against which the government had  to guide its space programs. Financing was  dependent on the support of a broad cross section of the people, and an appeal to their  space dreams became a major factor in all  planning. However useful unmanned, instru mented vehicles proved to be, the National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  judged manned flights to have the greater  public  appeal. The  culmination  of  this  policy was  the ""greatest show on Earth,""  the 1969 Apollo landing on the Moon (600  million viewers on world television), and it  showed what can be achieved for $21 billion.  Alas, this giant step for mankind was not  to  be  followed  by  another. The Apollo  flights to the moon now look more like the  end of an era rather than the beginning.  The shuttle was the next manned project,  but it could fire the imagination only if it  could be seen as the tool for new space con quests. Manned flights to Mars were hinted,  but could not be seriously proposed.  Now NASA proposes to build a space sta tion, and has obtained the support of Presi dent Reagan. A large space habitat is to be  assembled in orbit, from smaller units that  can be carried up by the shuttle. It would  house several persons, and it would be kept  permanently manned. A  range of experi ments and observations would be carried out  on board. The cost? It is hardly worth quot ing  the $8-billion  to $20-billion estimates  now being made.  The expense of the space station project  would be much greater than that of con struction. A  regular  sequence  of  space  launches would be required to supply and  refurbish the spacelab. Running the space  station would become the bread-and-butter  work of NASA on a far higher level of ex penditure than NASA is operating on now.  A commitment of  this kind would assure  NASA and a substantial part of the aero space industry a high level of support for a  long time to come.  Even if the space station did not justify its  running expenses, politically it would be ex tremely difficult  to abandon such a pro gram, when  the  initial cost had been so  high. The decision to build a space station is  therefore one that will fix the direction of  the U.S. space program for a long time to  come. Is it the right direction?  It is sometimes said that it is  inevitable  that man will fly  to the other planets, or  even to other solar systems far out there  among the stars. Surely the space station is  the first step in that direction, to learn how  to assemble large units in orbit, and to learn  how to live for long periods in space.  Unfortunately, so long as we have only  the propulsion  that chemical rockets can  provide, an expedition to another planet is  not practicable. It would require the assem bly in orbit of a ship of many thousands of  tons, and the cost would be very many times  the cost of the Apollo program. The round trip time to Mars would be more than two  years. It is possible, yes, but it is not likely  to happen.  If one day a far more efficient propulsion  system is  invented,  then perhaps one can  think again. But that will not happen over night, and there will be plenty of time to ex ercise men in orbit while this new capability  is being developed. The space station is not  tackling the hard part of the problem; it is  only dealing with the part that we know we  could solve.  Another  ""inevitability""  claim  is  that  human populations will eventually spill out  into space, and large space cities will accom modate  those whom  the Earth  can no  longer harbor. The space station is to be the  first step. But if it is population pressure  that is to create this situation, then first we  would surely want  to  fill  those areas on  Earth that are empty at the moment but  much more easily supplied with the where withal for living than outer space.  Another claim has been that the space  station would serve as a good observation  post, both for looking up and looking down.  But for that it is clearly inferior to the un manned  vehicles  that  are  already  in  common use. Looking down on the Earth  for military survelliance or for the various  studies of the Earth's surface and the at mosphere requires a variety of orbits, espe cially orbits that go to high geographic lati tudes and orbits that are stationary with re spect to the rotating Earth. The space sta tion will only be in one low-latitude, close Earth orbit. and it will be essentially  im movable from that orbit. Furthermore, ob serving equipment, for the most part, has its  accurate pointing upset by  the  slightest  motion on a spacecraft. For this reason, an  unmanned vehicle is far preferable.  A manned space station could act as a  base for men to go out and assemble very  large structures, such as  radio antennas.  They could serve useful purposes, both for  astronomical observations and for terrestri al communications systems. But before de ciding that such a construction would justi fy a  reasonable fraction of  the cost of a  space station, one would have to know what  purpose is to be served, whether the orbit is  a desirable one, and what the costs of vari ous methods of assembly-manned or un manned-might be. Deciding on the means  of doing a  job before specifying  the  job  itself is never a good policy.  Another suggested purpose is the manu facture of goods in zero gravity or the good  vacuum of space. It certainly has not yet  been demonstrated that sufficiently valua ble products could be made there that could  not be made on Earth, even with  invest ments of many billions of dollars. During  the quarter century of space flight, the pos sibility has often been discussed, yet not a  single example of such a product exists.  This is so despite many manned space mis sions  that searched for  things  to do and  settle for such experiments as determining  which way guppies would swim, or whether  a particular spider could build  its web  in  zero gravity.  The one field where one cannot doubt the  utility of long-duration manned space flight  concerns the physiological effects that such  space flight has on humans. But why would  this  justify a multibillion dollar program,  when there is no plan in sight that requires  prolonged manned space flight?  Unmanned,  instrumented space vehicles  are free from many of the limitations which  exist for manned flight. They are cheap by  comparison;  light and small;  they do not  have to be returned; they can transmit any  information that can be gathered from loca tions to which they go; they can be sent on  a great variety of orbits and  trajectories,  and they can endure flights of many years'  duration.  The technology of detailed remote control  and of data management is advancing rapid ly, and any action that an astronaut could  take in an Earth-orbital vehicle could also  be commanded from  the ground  to a  re motely  controlled mechanism  in  an un manned spacecraft.  It seems  so  clear  to  many scientists and engineers that this is  the way of progress of modern technology,  that the continued preoccupation of NASA  with manned flight is a stumbling block.  The space station would drain funds and  technological ability a.way  from advanced  unmanned projects, and slow down the evo lution of our real space capabilities.  ",1984

I saw the other day that the admin istration said it would be $400 million  over a several-year period.  So I think that whatever particular  figures we might select for debate or  argument or whatever, it still brings  me back  to  the  fundamental point  that  the  effect  of  the  Senator's  amendment would be to eliminate, for  all practical purposes, any serious con tinued, near term-and I  suppose  it  would reflect a long term-position of  military assistance to the Government  of El Salvador.

AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES  TO MEET  PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS  ",1984
132,Senate,98,0.056,121,6,Mr. HATFIELD.," Mr.  President  Evelyn Murray, a tireless opponent of  nerve gas weapons production, recent ly brought the following article to my  attention. It serves as the foundation  for the current scientific study of the  Reagan  administration  charge  that  the Soviet Union employed chemical  weapons in Southeast Asia. In the case  presented to Congress during discus sion of nerve gas weapons production  funding in the fiscal year 1984 Depart ment of Defense appropriations bill,  the administration pointed to evidence  of ""Yellow Rain""  in Southeast Asia.  Because it is obvious that the Soviet  violated the 1925 Geneva protocol on  chemical weapons and the 1972 treaty  on  biological  and  toxic  weapons,  argued proponents, the United States  must renew production of nerve gas  weapons to maintain a suficient deter rent. In assuming the obvious, however,  the  administration  ignored  the  most  basic  requirement  of  science:  Proof. The following article could shed  profound  light  on  the  allegations.  ""Yellow Rain"" by Louis Ember was  published in the January 9, 1984 edi tion  of Chemical  and Engineering  News.  The article follows:  [From the Chemical and Engineering News,  Jan. 9, 19841  THE SCIENCE OF YELLOW RAIN  The entire June 6, 1983,  issue of C&EN  examined the uncertainties over the health  effects of dioxin in the environment. Simi larly, this issue is largely devoted to another  matter involving chemicals in the environ ment: yellow rain.  Yellow rain is the imprecise name given to  toxin-based weapons  the U.S. government  charges the Soviet Union and its allies of  using  in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan.  The editorial in the June 6 issue described  the dioxin matter as ""a brew of uncertain  science, unanswered and sometimes unan swerable health questions, regulatory dilem mas,  intensive press  coverage,  and  legal  maneuverings."" As it turns out, that descrip tion fits the yellow rain issue too.  The U.S. charge  is  in keeping with the  Reagan Administration's characterization of  the Soviet Union as the ""focus of evil in the  modern world."" It is also an incredibly seri ous charge. It undermines all arms negotia tions because it accuses the Soviet Union of  flagrant violation of both the 1925 Geneva  Protocol on chemical weapons and the 1972  treaty on biological and toxin weapons.  In view of the critical nature of this issue,  it would not be unreasonable to expect that  the U.S. has an irrefutably strong case to  support its charges, and, especially, that the  supporting science is sound. But this is not  the case.  When Secretary of State Alexander Haig  first accused the Soviets in September 1981,  the only scientific evidence in hand was the  unconfirmed finding by one laboratory of  parts-per-millon  quantities  of  three  tri chothecene toxins on a single leaf and stem  taken from an alleged chemical attack site  in Kampuchea. To this day the sum total of  physical evidence from Afghanistan consists  of a trace amount of a trichothecene on the  face of a  gas mask obtained-apparently  purchased-in Kabul. The total of govern ment-obtained positive environmental sam ples from Southeast Asia has grown only to  five. These all have been reported by one  private  laboratory. None have been con firmed by independent analyses. The Army  has failed  to find  trichothecenes  in more  than 50 such samples it has tested. And evi dence from biomedical samples from alleged  victims is ambiguous.  The government claims that it is very dif ficult to obtain physical evidence of chemi cal warfare from remote and wartorn areas  to which it has no access and that its scien tific effort should not be  judged by  the  standards of a Ph. D. thesis. This is reasona ble. But it does not explain why the scientif ic case the government has tendered public ly has been so poorly presented, why it lacks  the normal cross-checks, and why elements  of it have been at variance with data al ready in the scientific literature. It also does  not explain the lack of serious response to  issues  raised by knowledgeable  scientists.  But it does reflect a contempt for good sci ence shown by some within the State De partment.  The government  implies  that  it  really  does not need the science, that it can prove  its case with an overwhelming volume of  eyewitness reports and classified data. This  is disingenuous First,  the government did  not go public with its charges until it had  the first ""smoking gun"" evidence in hand.  And, second, it is very difficult to conceive  how  it can substantiate  its central  thesis  that the Soviet Union is behind the use of  toxin weapons  in Southeast Asia without  the science.  Government  scientists  investigating  yellow rain have been in an unenviable posi tion ever since Haig first went public with  his charge. This position becomes more dif ficult with every repetition of the charge.  The uncertainties over the science of yellow  rain cannot be left unresolved. Until they  are settled, they cloud the issue of whether  treaty-violating chemical of any kind have  been used in recent times in Southeast Asia.  A first step should be a peer review of the  government's yellow rain case by an inde pendent panel of scientists, conducted in an  open manner and with access to as much of  the intelligence as can prudently be declas sified.  MICHAEL HEYLIN,  Editor.  YELLOW RAIN  For years, and from faraway places have  come reports of death and sickness from the  skies. The tales from ruggedly independent  and mostly  illiterate mountain people of  Laos, Kampuchea, and Afghanistan tell of  aircraft-,  rocket-,  and  artillery-delivered  clouds of yellowish material that killed rap idly and grotesquely those directly hit. Vil lagers more  fortunate and  further away  became ill, but with a strange combination  of symptoms.  Survivors often  told  tales of mysterious  yellow rainlike spots on or near their vil lages that they called yellow rain and associ ated with deaths and illnesses. These tales  spurred U.S.  investigations. First U.S. em bassy personnel collected the victims' grim  stories. Then military physicians examined  these people, now  in  refugee camps,  for  signs of chemical agents used. And finally,  the U.S. launched an intensified search for  physical evidence.  From the early surveys came the specula tion that three possible agents-a harassing  agent, a nerve gas, and an unknown chemi cal-were being used. Chemical analysis of  collected material proved futile. No  tradi tional chemical agent-no riot control gas,  mustard gas, or nerve gas-could be detect ed. And still the reports of skin irritation  and lesions, of bloody diarrhea and vomit ing, of dizziness and trembling, and of death  flooded local embassies after alleged yellow  rain attacks. The mysterious  toxic agent  causing these symptoms remained elusive to  the chemist's probe for seven years.  Then on Sept. 13, 1981, in West Germany,  Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig ad dressed the Berlin Press Association. In an  otherwise unnotable speech, Haig said: ""For  some time now, the international communi ty has been alarmed by continuing reports  that the Soviet Union and its allies have  been using lethal chemical weapons in Laos,  Kampuchea, and Afghanistan .... We now  have physical evidence from Southeast Asia  which has been analyzed and found to con tain abnormally high levels of three potent  mycotoxins-poisonous  substances not  in digenous to the region and which are highly  toxic to man and animals.""

133,Senate,98,0.078,134,6,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr.  President,  this  week  the Congressional Wives  for  Soviet Jewry is hosting an internation al  conference  in Washington, D.C.  With over 50 wives of Members of the  U.S. Congress, as well as wives from  members of the Canadian, British, Is raeli,  and Netherland Governments,  the CWSJ has become a forceful and  active participant in the international  effort to call attention to the plight of  Soviet Jewry and to support efforts to  free the thousands of victims of Soviet  oppression.  It is testament to this great democ racy we  call America  that  these  women will assemble in our Nation's  Capital to meet with top administra tion officials such as Robert McFar lane, Assistant  to  the President for  National Security Affairs, and Elliott  Abrams,  Assistant  Secretary  for  Human Rights and Humanitarian Af fairs, and to hear Elie Wiesel, himself  a Holocaust survivor and one of the  most eloquent voices in opposition to  persecution,  discrimination,  and  op pression wherever  it  exists  in  the  world. No such opportunities exist in  the Soviet Union.  Anatoly Shcharansky, Iosif Begun, Viktor  Brailovsky, Ida Nudel, these are just a few  of the literally hundreds of names that have  become symbols of  the movement  to put  pressure on the Soviet Government so that  these innocent victims can achieve a  long held dream of  joining  their  family  and  friends in the United States or Israel. Our  efforts toward this important goal must not  cease.  Mr. President, I would like to take  this opportunity to extent my sincere  appreciation  to  the  congressional  wives  for  their work on behalf of  Soviet Jewry, and to the National Con ference on Soviet Jewry for their ef forts. Mr. President,  I  ask  to have  printed in the RECORD a  letter I  re ceived from Elena Fridman, the sister  of  Ida Nude!, who  is now  living  in  Israel and eagerly awaiting her sister's  release from the Soviet Union. I would  also like to place in the RECORD a New  York Times article about the congres sional wives conference this week.  The letters follow:  REHOVOT, ISRAEL, February 28, 1984.  Hon. H. JOHN HEINZ,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, D. C., U.S.A.  DEAR SENATOR HEINZ: I continue to appre ciate the depth of your concern for the fate  of my sister, Ida Nudel, and your efforts to  bring about the reunification of our small  family.  I write to you at this time in anticipation  of the upcoming international conference of  the Congressional Wives for Soviet Jewry  scheduled to take place in Washington D.C.  at  the beginning of April, knowing  that  many of Ida's and my friends will partici pate and hoping you will share this report  with  those  participants with whom you  have contact.  Having legally completed her sentence of  four years of  internal exile  in Siberia  in  March 1982, followed by a frightening six month period of homelessness during which  she was denied municipal residence permits  in  numerous  places,  including  her  own  apartment in Moscow, she was finally al lowed  residence  in  the  small Moldavian  town of Bendery. Yet this has proved to be  another form of exile.  It was the thousands of letters she had re ceived in Siberia which had helped sustain  her spirit. Since arriving  in Bendery, she  has received almost no mail. Many people  have written to me saying that their letters  have been returned with a note from  the  Soviet  postal  authorities  indicating  ""In connu: No Such Address."" I have seen some  of the envelopes and know they have been  correctly addressed.  For the past year she has worked as an  attendant at the local Bendery amusement  park. Her heart condition has flared up on  occasion, but she has not left the town for  medical  treatment, as she had previously  been told that her entry into Moscow was  forbidden.  During  the past  two months,  I  have  become increasingly alarmed by certain new  developments. The Soviet authorities seem  to be  intent on precipitating yet another  confrontation with Ida by outrageous provo cations.  This began on January 5 of  this year  when  she was  summoned  by  the  local  deputy police chief who warned her that  she was  being watched  ""by  the people  whose job it is to do so"" and that she was  not to have any more visits to her home by  the ""people who call  themselves  'refuse niks'."" She was also warned not  to  leave  Bendery.  Non-compliance  would  mean  arrest, the official said. The timing of this  warning was clearly a result of Ida's celebra tion of the Jewish holiday of Chanuka with  some friends who  joined her three weeks  earlier.  On January 24, 1984, she was summoned  by Mr. Arlen Mikhailovitch  Shebanow,  Deputy Chairman of the Bendery Supervi sory Commission on Laws on Religion, who  stated that he knew that on the Jewish reli gious holiday of Chanuka people got togeth er in her home. He suggested to her that  she register herself according to the by-laws  pertaining to religious groups in Moldavia.  According to law <he proceeded to quote the  following):  ""Passed as an Order by Presidium Su preme Soviet of Moldavia SSR, Number  1616-IX-19/V 1977  ""Paragraph 8: An organization or group of  people who believe may begin their activi ties only after a  decision as been  taken  based on  registration by  the Committee  dealing With Religious Matters of the Su preme SSSR Committee of Ministers.""  Ida bravely replied that matters of reli gious belief are not a proper subject for dis cussion between a government official and a  private citizen. The official  indicated that  not applying for this registration would be a  clear violation of this law  if she plans to  again have people in her home to celebrate  such holidays.  Senator Heinz, I have come to know you  as a friend of Ida's as someone concerned  with her fate. I am alarmed by this latest  development. The Soviet authorities are ob viously bent on making the advent of every  holiday in the Jewish calendar a period of  fear for Ida, for me and for all those dedi cated people the world over who treasure  the principles which guide her.  After twelve years of refusals, as she ap proaches her 53th birthday on April 27, the  time has certainly come for the Soviet au thorities to relent and allow her to join me  in Israel. I know that with your continued  help, we  can  accomplish  this  seemingly  modest but inexplicably difficult goal.  Sincerely yours,  ELENA FRIDMAN.  CONGRESSIONAL WIVES TAKE ON DELICATE  ISSUE  <By Barbara Gamarekian)  WASHINGTON, April 1.-For more than five  years, a group of Congressional wives has  quietly pursued a cause. The women write  letters, make speeches, hold silent vigils in  front of the Soviet Embassy and meet with  dissidents in Moscow and Russian emigres  in Washington.  The group, Congressional Wives for Soviet  Jewry, is one of the many organizations in  the capital with a cause. In this case, the  women have banded together to support the  cause of human rights in the Soviet Union.  Congressional Wives for Soviet Jewry  is  sponsoring  a  three-day  conference  that  starts today. Some 20 wives of Members of  Parliament  from Canada, England,  Israel  and  the Netherlands will  join wives  of  American lawmakers in meetings with offi cials, including President Reagan's national  security adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, and  the Assistant Secretary of State for Human  Rights, Elliot Abrams. On Tuesday night,  Elie Wiesel, the noted writer on the Holo caust. will speak at a dinner in the Senate  Caucus Room.  NO MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR  A request to meet with the Soviet Ambas sador here has gone unanswered, according  to Dolores Beilenson, co-chairman of  the  group. And a request that the women meet  with Nancy Reagan, Mrs. Beilenson said,  ""could not be worked out.""  Mrs. Beilenson is the wife of Representa tive Anthony C. Beilenson, Democrat of  California. The other cochairmen of  the  group are Joanne Kemp, wife of Represent ative Jack Kemp, Republican of Buffalo;  Teresa Heinz, wife of Senator John Heinz,  Republican of Pennsylvania, and Shirley  Metzenbaum, wife of Senator Howard M.  Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio.  The group was founded  in 1978 by Mrs.  Kemp and Helen Jackson, wife of Senator  Henry M. Jackson, the Washington Demo crat who died last year, after several Con gressional  wives  had met with  Avital  Shcharansky, wife of the imprisoned Jewish  dissident Anatoly B. Shcharansky.  The 45 members of  the group  include  women whose husbands represent all shades  of the political spectrum.  ",1984
134,,98,-0.4,147,6,Ms. OAKAR.," Mr. Speaker, our Na tion's and region's future depends on  dynamic leadership in areas related to  employment and training. The follow ing is an article which demonstrates a  dynamic leader.  CCC CHIEF HAS HIGH HOPES FOR JOB CENTER  <By John Leo Koshar>  Nolen M. Ellison, president of Cuyahoga  Community College, spent a year working  with a national task force of the American  Association of Community and Junior Col leges <AACJC) on how to put America back  to work.  ""Now that program is coming to fruition  here in line with Gov. <Richard F.) Celeste's  plan for strategic planning to develop jobs,""  Ellison said in an interview recently.  Ellison was  referring  to Celeste's an nouncement earlier this month of the re lease of $8.5 million to build a Unified Tech nologies Center on the CCC Metro Campus.  Ground breaking  is  scheduled for June  and Ellison said it could be fully operational  by fall 1986.  Previous announcements have  indicated  the center will have the capacity to train or  retrain  1,400  people  annually  in  high  growth industries and for changing technol ogies.  ""We will work with business and industry  to define and describe what kind of training  and retraining they think they will need to  obtain employment,"" he said.  That, he indicated, will determine the size  of the student body.  advisory  committee  of  industry  people will help shape the curriculum,"" he  said. ""They will advise what kind of pro gram is needed for training and retraining.  We will work directly with business and in  dustry. That will be  the strength of this  program and will make it unique.""  He said that 39 of the top corporate chief  executives that are part of the Cleveland  Tomorrow campaign are working with the  college to develop a technical training pro gram that relates to state-of-the -art manu facturing opportunities.  ""The keynote of the center will be flexi bility and  responsiveness  to  the needs of  business and industry,"" said Ellison. ""The  object is to bring about a strong match be tween the needs of business and industry  and the people we will tum out.""  ""An  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Ellison said college officials also are talk ing  to Ford Motor Co., which operates a  program of training people that might come  back to the company in computer technolo gy  and other  skills  and  to  equip  those  people Ford cannot keep with skills for jobs  elsewhere.  He said Dr. Ron Zambetti, provost of the  Urban Metropolitan Development Institute,  visited Ford's training facility in Nashville,  Tenn., recently to help determine how to or ganize the CCC center. The institute is the  outreach arm of CCC responsible for devel opment of the center.  CCC  also  is working with Technicare  Corp.  to develop  tailor-made  courses de signed for  its specific occupational needs,  such as in computer repair and other areas.  Ellison said it is very difficult to guaran tee 100%  job placement  for  the center's  trainees. He emphasized that "". . . we are  going to try to close the gap between train ing and placement and make that gap as  narrow as possible because the people who  will be trained or retrained need to feel they  are being trained for jobs that exist and not  just to be trained as an end in itself.""  He said  the center would contain a  re source support system for small businesses  that should have a  tremendous impact on  this group.  The business community will be involved  not only in helping to develop the curricu lum but in selecting the chief executive offi cer for the center and its staff, said Ellison.  ""We think staffing will have some unique  characteristics. We will seek some of the top  people  in  business  and  industry  to  get  skilled craftsmen brought into our teaching  and training corps.  ""We will  look  for  industry-experienced  people with less theory and more applica tion.""  The center will be designed  to provide  work-force  education  and  training  in  modem, applied high technologies through  hands-on  use  of  industry-specific  equip ment, machinery and laboratories.  Training and retraining will be for jobs in  high growth industries such as energy and  instrumentation technologies and electronic  and mechanical technologies.  More  than  26,000  square  feet  of  the  96,000-square-foot facility will be devoted to  applied skills training for private industry.  Lecture and laboratory instruction will in clude energy and instrumentation technol ogies with courses such as solar energy, fuel  cells, helium gas turbines, fusions, metrolo gy and computerized energy monitoring.  Instruction in electronic technologies will  encompass courses in microcomputer hard ware, microprocessor  technologies,  satel lites, video discs, videotex, optical fibers and  laser technology.  Mechanical technologies will focus on ma chining in industry, especially computer-as sisted manufacturing, machine maintenance  and repair and tool-and-die training.  It also will include metal fabrication, weld ing production, plastics, electromechanical fluidal-thermalpneumatics training and ro botization  in manufacturing allied health  applications.  Trainees will have full use of the Metro  Campus services, such as career planning  and placement.

He said the center would be run on a 12month program basis and he hopes  that  contracts with businesses and industries will  help pay for the larger part of the tuitions.  7423  Class scheduling specifications call for of fering  four different options:  accelerated  full-time (eight hours per day,  three days  per week>; regular full-time <four hours per  day, five days per week);  limited full-time  <eight hours per day,  two days per week>;  part-time <three hours per evening,  four  evenings per week>.   TRIBUTE TO ""UNIONIST OF THE  YEAR"": JOHN BIGELOW  HON. FORTNEY H. (PETE) STARK  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 2, 1984  ",1984
135,,98,-0.631,147,6,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, on March  30th, the Central Labor Council of Al ameda County, AFL-CIO,  honored  John Bigelow  as  ""Unionist  of  the  Year.""  Mr. Bigelow is being recognized for  his untiring efforts on behalf of the  labor movement and for his many civic  contributions.  In 1939,  John Bigelow  joined his  first union,  local 1114, which is now  the  Amalgamated  Transit  Union,  while working  for Greyhound  bus  lines. He left there to join the United  Brotherhood of Carpenters and Join ers Local 2116  in 1941. Transferring  from that local to Carpenters 554, he  worked in the shipyards until August  1943, when he  joined  the merchant  marine. He sailed  first as a marine  cook and steward, then as a member of  the SUP on six ships. On four of them,  he was ship's delegate  for  the deck  gang <shop steward).  When he  left  the sea  in January  1946, John went to work for the Amer ican Can Co., where he  joined  the  United Steel Workers Union, Local  1798. He was vice president of  that  union from 1947-49. When the Steel workers issued a new charter for the  American Can plant, Bigelow became  a charter member of that local and  served as its chief steward for 12 years.  When John Bigelow joined the Ash land  fire department  in 1961,  there  were no organized firefighters south  or east of San Leandro. Shortly after  his arrival, he helped organize and get  a charter from the International Asso ciation of Firefighters. He was  the  local's  first president and  served 8  years in that capacity. On retiring in  1977, he was honored by receiving the  first lifetime membership ever award ed by that membership. John's leader ship in organizing the firefighters in  Ashland not only provided benefits to  his fell ow employees, but he was  in strumental in establishing charters in  many other surrounding cities in Ala meda County.  Very  early  in his union  activity,  John  recognized  the  importance of  labor councils. He was a delegate  to  the CIO Council from 1946 until the  merger of the two councils, becoming  ",1984
136,Senate,98,-0.328,186,6,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, the labor  advisers' case is one in which we must  be  especially concerned because,  as  with the case surrounding the murders  of the four American churchwomen,  American citizens were  involved. But  at the same time we cannot lose sight  of the thousands of other innocent vic tims whose deaths have gone unan swered. There have been no  trials.  There has not been one conviction.  Mr. President, let me just say in con clusion, as to the case being made by  the Senator from Massachusetts with  his amendment, I think it is important  that our colleagues realize here that  this amendment is merely an expres sion on the part of this body to try  and bring some sanity in that country,  and I only wish it would. I am not op timistic about it, given the recent past  events.  My only hope would be as we get  sometimes, I think, caught up in deal ing with specific amendments, we do  not lose sight of the larger picture and  the larger issue which is at stake here,  and that is ultimately whether or not  the Government of El Salvador  is  going to take the necessary steps to re build confidence  in  its own country  and to get about the business of trying  to bring an end to that violence and to  the war in that nation so that it can be  at least a safe environment for eco nomic aid and assistance.  And it seems too often we get to ar guing numbers here rather than the  overall broad policy questions. I sus pect that is what we are sort of caught  up in a bit this week, that we are going  to lose sight of the forest for the trees  in some way.  But this amendment I think will give  this body at least a chance to express  itself to some degree of consistency on  the issue of the death squads as they  pertain particularly to two Americans  and one Salvadoran. By the way, there  was an El Salvadoran, who was assassi nated that evening as well along with  Mr. Pearlman, Mr. Hammer. Mr. Jose  Rodolfo Viera, who was director of El  Salvador's land reform program, was  also murdered  that evening  in  the  hotel.  It just might send, in addition to the  other signals as, we call them, an indi cation of where  this body stands at  least on this issue, if not on the issue  of  continuation  of  the  conflict  in  combat and the likelihood of U.S. mili tary  involvement  in  a  direct way.  Maybe this will help.  So for that reason, Mr. President, I  will support this amendment.  I yield.  ",1984
137,Senate,98,0.068,186,6,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I am  voting in favor of tabling this amend ment because I believe it significantly  diffuses  the focus of attention from  the efforts to limit 30 percent of the  funding for El Salvador until there is  a verdict on the national guardsmen  who are defendants in the case involv ing the four U.S. churchwomen. On  the  fiscal  year  1984  appropriations  bill, I added such an amendment limit ing 30 percent of an appropriation of  approximately $64 million until there  was a verdict in that case. Representa tives of  the U.S. State Department  and members of the Salvadoran Gov ernment concede that the 30 percent  limitation has been effective in push ing the nuns' case ahead for trial.  The case  involved  in  this amend ment, known as the Sheraton murder  case, involves much more complicated  issues of  law. For example,  the  two  gunmen cannot testify against the key  prospective military  defendant  be cause of Salvadoran law which prohib its one coconspirator testifying against  another  coconspirator.  Under  our  principles of law, such a coconspirator  can testify against another coconspira tor.  The so-called Sheraton case is now  on appeal from one El Salvadoran ap pellate court to a higher El Salvador an appellate court. All factors consid ered, the procedural snarl and the dif ferences  in  law make  the  so-called  Sheraton military case a much more  difficult case to use to impose condi tionality on U.S. aid to El Salvador.  It is my  judgment, that the nuns'  case has the best chance of motivating  the El Salvadoran judicial system and  that the source of attention should  remain on that case for the reasons I  have discussed.

139,House,98,-0.444,251,6,Mr. STUDDS.,"  I  thank the gentle man for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of the MarAd authorization bill. I  am especially pleased that the legisla tion includes $5 million to be used in  conversion of the cargo ship. Santa  to a training vessel for the  Massachusetts Maritime Academy.  Since December 1981. when a tragic  fire destroyed the training ship. the  Bay State, and took the life of one  cadet.  the Massachusetts Maritime  Academy has been without  its own  vessel. In recent years, the school has  been  forced  to borrow a  ship  from  either the Maine or New York acade mies. an arrangement that has created  large  administrative  problems  and  worked  to  the detriment of all stu dents involved.  in  In fiscal year 1983. Congress author ized and appropriated some $10 mil lion for MarAd to either repair or re place the Bay State. I am pleased that  the Santa Mercedes has now been pur chased for  this purpose. However.  I  am concerned  that Mar Ad does not  have adequate funds available to carry  out the needed conversion. Approxi mately $5.8 million remains from the  $10 million already made available by  the Congress. but this is clearly insuf ficient to do the job right. MarAd and  I say this in respone to the observa tions of  the gentleman  from Ken tucky, will need at least the $5 million  made available by this bill to provide  the academy with the facility that its  students deserve and require.  The gentleman  is correct  that no  one can say with certainty at  this  point what the final bill will be. but I  think  if anything  is certain  this  world it is that this will not cover it.  I also want to take this opportunity  to. on behalf of the faculty and stu dents of the Massachusetts Maritime  Academy. thank the gentleman from  New York <Mr. BIAGGI). the chairman  of the subcommittee. for his efforts.  As he well knows. what we do with re spect to the determination of the ade quacy of conversion of this vessel will  set a precedent for conversions of ves sels still to come. presumably for the  remaining academies. one of which. as  the gentleman well knows.  is  in the  State of New York.  I  thank the gentleman very much  for his leadership and I urge strong  support of the bill.  ",1984

142,House,98,-0.242,277,6,Mr. ECKART.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, it has always been a  fundamental principle, I  suppose, of  our free enterprise system that Gov ernment should allow economic forces  to play as freely as possible through a  complex and diverse economy. It has  also been fundamental to Government  activities, when intervention is neces sary, that that intervention be based  principally on the theory of a free and  open economic market. For instance,  regulation deems to be a substitute for  competition or a monopoly is awarded,  such as in the areas of public utilities.  We have been called upon  in  the  past often to intervene for purposes of  remembering that our power to act is  and  really  always must be  closely  linked to the responsibility of Govern ment to act in the broader interests of  the majority of our citizens.  Essentially, the Government should  intervene in the affairs of private en terprise only in those very narrow in stances when the larger population is  adversely affected, when the national  interests, particularly as it may relate  to our Nation's defense, are hindered.  It may come as a shock to some, but  I am not prepared in the course of this  special order today to argue that big is  necessarily bad.  I am concerned, however, about the  recent trends toward the accumulation  of wealth in corporate America. Just  about 20 years ago, 400 of our Nation's  largest  corporations  controlled  two thirds  of  the  Nation's  corporate  wealth,  and now,  just  two decades  later,  the centralization has resulted  in  just 200  corporations controlling  almost 70 percent of this Nation's cor porate economic wealth.  Now we are confronted with a new  merger mania involving oil companies,  which is a spinoff of what took place  just 2112 years ago.  In February the FTC saw nothing  wrong with Texaco's $10.0 billion ac quisition of Getty Oil. Yet we can ask  how many  jobs were  created, how  many barrels of oil produced, how  much  economic  activity  stimulated  with that acquisition.  The Reagan  administration,  from  my perspective, has turned a blind eye  toward this and in fact they encourage  this  form of corporate  cannibalism  without any regard to the efficiencies  both  of  a management  or  capital  nature that may result.  Our energy industry is critical to the  economic revitalization of this Nation.  We cannot stand idly by and allow it  to go the path of other industries that  find  themselves  in  dire  economic  straits. However, if the consumers of  our  petrochemical  products  a.re  to  truly benefit, and we have  to make  sure that the economies a.re sea.led to  which mergers seem to promote, actu ally will give greater choice to us in  yea.rs a.head.  We  cannot witness  oil  companies  ta.king money that they have garnered  from  the decontrol of oil passed by  this House and accelerated by this ad ministration, and  instead of plowing  those profits back into capitalization  of other industries, spread it out into  nonproductive uses and in effect deny ing opportunities to capitally deprived  industries to grow.  These actions could ultimately prove  to be detrimental  to our economic  growth. And the prospect of increasing  concentration in an already dominant  oil industry of a few mega.giants may  not be  in  the best  interests of  the  public nor in the long-term economic  interests of this nation.  We cannot allow this administration  to continue to lead us down a yellow  brick road of economic recovery where  in every instance bigger is better. The  result  is  less competition, more mo nopolies.  But in enforcing a meaningful anti trust policy, I think we have to look at  what ought those standards to be. As  my friend from New York said, origi nal trust busting that went on in these  Halls almost 90 years ago was directly  and properly intended to diversify and  to give greater responsibility  to  the  public through the merger acquisition  process. Those  times have  changed  dramatically. I think we have to look  at the whole merger acquisition ques tion with three new central ideas:  First, in the merger that is contem plated, what new access to ca.pita.I or  cash flow will the merged companies  now have? Second, what impact will it  have not only on the domestic market  here  in  the United States but  the  international market as well, because  we are truly an international econo my? And third, what new efficiencies  to both management and operation  may result that will enhance an eco nomic entity's ability to be more pro ductive?  I think that a. reasonable argument  can be ma.de that the Justice Depart ment and the FTC have focused too  narrowly in recent decisions only on  the  impact of U.S. markets. They  failed  to  take  into account external  considerations such as  the changing  and more competitive global economy  and  the unf a.ir practices of  foreign  competitors.  As my friend from New York point ed out, you get the Justice Depart ment and the FTC considering similar  complaints from similar industries of  unf a.ir and illegal dumping practices,  denying to them economic opportuni ties in the United States, and at the  same time slamming the door on the  way for them to get out of those diffi cult economic  circumstances at  the  same time.  This merger  that we had dealing  particularly with Republic Steel and  LTV should in fact, if tested against  the three different principles of access  to capital and cash flow, international  ",1984

Prior  to the effort and the action of our  no  joint  commission,  young people  all  over  this country were very bitter.  Many of them said to me from time to  time, ""All you all are doing is ripping  us off with this social security system  that you have got. When we get out  there, eligible to receive any benefits,  either there won't be any social securi ty  system  or  there won't be  any  money.""  ",1984

145,,98,-0.578,355,6,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Speaker,  I am  proud and honored to once again par ticipate in the Congressional Call to  Conscience Vigil For Soviet Jewry, and  I  thank the distinguished gentleman  from Pennsylvania, Mr. COUGHLIN, for  organizing this effort. I believe that,  as Members of this body, we must con tinue  to  take every opportunity  to  speak out against the flagrant denial  of basic human rights in the Soviet  Union.  Mr. Speaker, conditions in the Soviet  Union have been deteriorating at a  rapid rate for those of Jewish faith.  Not only is emigration at an alltime  low, with a mere 1,218 Jewish people  allowed to leave in 1983 compared to  the almost 51,000 allowed to leave in  1979, but reports of widespread har rassment and oppression are on the in crease. the anti-Semitic policies of the  Soviet Government have made  the  daily existence of many Soviet Jews a  difficult,  frustrating  and  seemingly  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  dis hopeless,  struggle  for  survival. The  fundamental freedom to learn about,  and take pride in, one's culture, histo ry and religion is denied to the Soviet  Jewish citizen. Individuals who openly  attempt to develop their Jewish identi ty are sure to encounter various forms  of intimidation and persecution. The  desire on the part of Soviet Jews to  escape this persecution through emi gration  is  considered  a  punishable  crime.  A tragic case in point is that of 23year-old Aleksandra Lein. Aleksandra,  daughter of former prisoner of con science, Evgeny Lein, applied for per mission to emigrate with her family in  April 1978. Permission was refused to  the Lein family in August of that year  on grounds of ""secrecy."" Since that  time, additional applicants to emigrate  have been repeatedly and systemati cally denied. The Leins, Aleksandra in cluded, are well known among the Re fuseniks since they study Hebrew and  Jewish culture and history. This labels  them as ""activisits"" in the lexicon of  the Soviet regime.  Shortly after Aleksandra's first ap plication  to  emigrate,  she was  missed from the night institute where  she took classes. Later, she had the  frightening  and  humiliating  experi ence of being assaulted in the street.  The police did everything possible to  avoid presssing charges against her at tackers. Finally, this past January, a  few short months before she was to  marry, Aleksandra was fired from her  job as a computer operator. Aleksan dra's dismissal  coincided with  the  firing of six other prominent Refuse niks-a further attempt to harrass the  Jewish  community  as part of  the  Soviet leadership's intensified anti-Se mitic campaign.  Aleksandra, a  spirited and strong willed young woman, took the issue to  court, hoping to have her job reinstat ed. Her  employer  testified on her  behalf. He told the court that she was  an  excellent  employee-knowledgea ble,  skillful,  and  responsible.  The  court, however, chose to rule against  Aleksandra, and  for  the  first  time,  publicly stated that ""those who apply  to emigrate will be the first to go in  cases of staff reduction.""  Although Aleksandra  is  preparing  another court appeal, her experience  demonstrates in a clearer fashion than  usual  that anti-Semitic policies  are  rampant. Aleksandra, and others like  her, must be admired for their bravery  as well as their ability to persevere in  the face of discrimination, economic  hardship,  and  even physical  abuse.  However, they are counting on our ef forts  to bring hope for their future.  We cannot let them down. I urge each  of my colleagues  to work not only  toward increased emigration for Soviet  Jews, but toward freedom and justice  for those who, for one reason or an other, remain in the Soviet Union.e  7631  PROTECT AMERICAN PRODUCTS  FROM COUNTERFEITERS  HON.THOMASJ.DOWNEY  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 3, 1984  e ",1984
146,,98,-0.384,355,6,Mr. DOWNEY of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, in the final hours of the first  session I introduced H.R. 4502, legisla tion which uses special trade pref er ences as  a  lever  to  stop  industrial  counterfeiting  by  developing  coun tries.  Today,  along with 14 of my col leagues, I am introducing a bill which  makes  several  improvements  to  the  original. Most importantly, it affords  the  same  protection  for  published  products as the first bill provided for  manufactured goods, and therefore it  has  the  expanded  backing  of  the  American publishing  industry. Addi tionally,  this new bill uses  language  similar to that already enacted as part  the Caribbean Basin  Initiative,  lan guage proved successful in halting the  pirating of textbooks in the Domini can Republic and of cable  television  signals by Jamaica. Finally, this new  bill is very similar to a bill working its  way through the Senate.  Industrial counterfeiting by foreign  nationals is a serious and growing eco nomic problem for us. A recent Inter national Trade Commission study esti mated that American companies are  losing from $6  to $8 billion in sales  each year and at least 131,000 jobs.  Many  counterfeit  goods  are  sold  abroad, cutting into needed markets  for American goods. A wide variety of  products are popular targets including  clothing, precision tools, drugs, farm  chemicals, and high technology equip ment to name a few.  While the impact on our American  manufacturers is clear, there is little  they can do legally. This bill attempts  to solve  the problem at  its source.  Under the generalized system of pref erences <GSP>. certain countries such  as Taiwan, Brazil, and South Korea  qualify for duty-free tariff treatment  in import dealings with our country in  order to promote their economic devel opment. This program has been bene ficial to the countries known to be the  source of the most notorious counter feiters. The  bill  I  am  introducing  today ties future GSP benefits to the  willingness of each country to enact  and enforce stricter laws protecting in tellectual property rights. The GSP is  due to be renewed before the end of  the year and I intend to add this bill  as an amendment.  I  invite my col leagues' support and ask that a copy  of the new version be printed here:  Section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974 <19  U.S.C. 2462) is amended< 1 > by striking out ""and"" at the end of  subsection <b><6>;  ",1984

Miss Mackin has the honor of writ ing the winning speech in the Voice of  Democracy contest sponsored by the  U.S. Veterans of Foreign Wars and its  Ladies Auxiliary. Over 300,000 second ary students participated in the con test and I am proud that a constituent  of mine is the prestigious winner.  With students like Miss Mackin we  should be proud of the generation of  students who will some day become  the new leaders of the United States.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to share  with my colleagues this prize winning  speech and hope they enjoy it as much  as I did.  The speech follows:  MY ROLE IN UPHOLDING OUR CONSTITUTION  America . . . just the sound of the word  makes you feel good. Maybe because Amer ica means freedom, and opportunity, and  dreams, but possibly  the greatest  thing  about America is her people. So many dif ferent people. People  from  all over  the  world come to live  in America. Some risk  their lives  to reach the freedom we have  here. And once men are here they are will ing to die to keep our country free . . . and  it's not surprising.  Freedom is so priceless a gift. To have the  freedom  to speak your will,  to reach for  your dreams, and to be who you want to be  is so distant to many countries around the  world, yet in America it is a way of life.  Each and every person has the chance at  doing what he or she really wants to do.  With  the right determination one person  can affect all humanity. Just one man or  one woman can change the world for the  rest of us. Whether that change is a benefi cial one or not.  A single person, a single mind, a single  belief can make history. Take Mother The resa or take Adolf Hitler. It does not matter  whether you are a man or a woman, wheth er you are black, or white, or oriental, one  person adds so much to the world.

I have consistently supported con gressional involvement in situations in  which U.S. combat troops become di rectly involved in hostilities in foreign  countries. During debate on this bill I  supported another amendment which  would  have  limited  placement  of  combat troops in EI Salvador and man dated congressional approval of par ticipation of  those  troops  in active  combat hostilities. As  I  interpreted  that amendment,  it would not have  forbidden use of U.S. advisers or sur veillance aircraft. The present amend ment is too broadly worded and would  be prone to an overly general applica tion of limits on the presence of non combative American military person nel.  ",1984
151,Senate,98,0.1,433,6,Mr. COHEN.,"  I  thank the Senator  for yielding.  Mr. President. I was not on the floor  last Thursday afternoon when Sena tors MOYNIHAN,  INOUYE, and DUREN discussing U.S.  policy  toward Nicaragua and the conditions  placed by the Senate Select Commit tee on Intelligence on covert aid to the  Contras. But as I heard their remarks  in my office. I found myself fully in  agreement with what they were saying  and concluded that I should join them  in speaking here on  this  important  issue.  The covert aid issue is a difficult, a  troubling, one. Those of us on the In telligence Committee have been wres tling with it for some time. We have  come from many points of view. from  many perspectives. but we have sought  common ground. The recent 14  to 0  vote  reflects  our  commitment  to  reaching consensus decisions. ones we  can support in a bipartisan manner.  Chairman  GOLDWATER  and  Vice  Chairman  MOYNIHAN  deserve  the  highest praise for the leadership they  have shown in the area. And I want to  give  particular  credit  to  Senator  INOUYE, whose guidance and inspira tion have provided the legislative vehi cle which we  are considering here  today.  I endorse this measure which we are  debating today-and I endorse the In telligence Committee's recommenda tion. But I feel I must emphasize to  my colleagues my growing  concern  that the administration is paying in sufficient heed to the strong reserva tions and restrictions laid out by the  Intelligence Committee.  Since I joined the Intelligence Com mittee a year ago, the covert aid issue  has been the preeminent one which  has confronted us. While our sessions  are closed I believe I must make clear  that many of us have. as we debated  this issue. expressed the gravest of res ervations over how the money would  be spent.  Both the Senate and House Intelli gence Committees have approved the  use of covert aid for purposes of inter dicting the flow of arms from Nicara gua to those seeking to overthrow the  governments of neighboring countries.  This is a valid purpose. for the Sandi ntstas  themselves have stated flatly  that they are intent on exporting revo lution throughout Central America. In  fact. one of the Sandinista leadership's  senior members. Department of  the  Interior chief Thomas Borge, has said  that President Reagan was correct in  suggesting that this was their inten tion.  Last May.  the House Permanent  Select  Committee  on  Intelligence  stated, ""<The insurgency in El Salvador> depends for  its lifeblood-arms.  ammunition. financing, logistics. com mand-and-control facilities-upon out side  assistance  from Nicaragua and  Cuba."" Last week it was reported that  half of the weapons used by Salvador an rebels were captured or acquired  from  that  country's  soldiers.  The  other half of the rebels' weapons. and  about 80 percent of their ammunition.  comes in from Nicaragua, according to  intelligence community estimates.  It is for this reason that the Intelli gence Committee has. on a bipartisan.  consensus basis.  supported  the con tinuation of covert assistance. But let  me emphasize again. that we approved  that aid only after establishing clear  limitations concerning  the purposes  for which it could be used. In fact. we  secured from the administration a new  Presidential  finding,  delivered  last  September 20, which  included more  precise and more  limited goals  than  the ones we had been briefed on earli er. That Presidential finding provided  the basis for the redefined program  which  received  committee  approval  last fall.  It has been and continues to be, my  belief  that  the  covert  assistance  should not be used for efforts to over throw the government or to attack the  economic infrastructure of the coun try. We should not condone acts aimed  at destroying powerplants. bridges and  the like.  Mr. President. I think I had a first hand glimpse of how this proscription  was being ignored. Last fall, my col league, Senator HART,  and  I visited  Nicaragua, El Salvador. and Honduras.  Our plane was an hour outside of Ma nagua when we received word that we  would have to divert to Honduras be cause the Managua airport was under  attack.  Later that day, when we finally ar rived in Nicaragua-the second plane  in after the bombing-we were shown  documents recoverd from the attack ing plane which could lead to no other  conclusion but that the individuals in volved had received some sort of out side assistance.  That attack was followed soon there after by explosions at oil refineries in  Nicaragua. And we have read regularly  of other attacks against economic tar gets. most recently the mining of har bors.  One can argue that the mining  is  also aimed at interrupting the flow of  supplies or ammunition going into El  Salvador. That case can probably be  made. But I want to say that I am  troubled by such actions. and I think  many of my colleagues who are speak ing here today are also  troubled by  them. They do not seem to be consist ent with the restrictions which have  consistently been outlined by both the  Senate and House Intelligence Com mittees as we have authorized covert  assistance to Nicaraguan Contras.  What has  troubled me  further  is  that our Government has not. in my  view.  followed  through on its stated  goals toward Nicaragua. We have said  that we want  the Nicaraguans  to  schedule elections. to reduce CUban in fluence in their country, to stop the  export of revolution  to  their neigh bors.  and  to ease  their  restrictions  against  the  press  and  opposition  groups within their country.  I  share  the skepticism about  the  good faith of the Sandinista regime,  but one cannot deny that they did.  last fall. take a number of initial steps  which were directed toward our con cerns.  Clearly, the steps taken were insuffi cient-they were not anywhere near  sufficient-but it is also clear that we  can exercise greater diplomatic efforts  to  bring  about  the  desired  goals.  Rather than rejecting the initiatives  made by the Sandinistas. we should  seek to expand them so that they con form to the promises they made as the  very  basis  of  the  revolution. We  should permit  them  to demonstrate  that they are willing to reduce Cuban  influence. We  should give  them  a  chance  to show  that  they will not  export their revolution to Costa Rica.  Honduras. El Salvador and the other  countries of Central America.  If. every time the Sandinistas take a  step, we tell them it is not enough and  simply continue the bombing, we can  never hope to have any positive influ ence on them. And if we continue to  provide open-ended assistance to those  seeking  to overthrow  them. we will  continue to sow the seeds of mistrust  within  their  government  and with  their people. Further. we will only  harden the views of the most strident  members  of  the  ruling  body  and  reduce our chances of winning  the  confidence of  those who  are more  moderate.  ",1984
152,Senate,98,-0.145,446,6,Mr. NUNN.," I share the sentiments  of the Senator from Connecticut on  this point. I think there is a very thin  line here. I think it is very important  that our Nation,  in our quest  for  trying to get other countries around  the world  to  join us  in our  fight  against terrorism, we ourselves, is able  to draw  that  line consistently. The  question I have at this late hour is  whether we have indeed drawn that  line, and whether we know what the  word means in this amendment.  Let me ask a hypothetical question.  Hypothetically, if any of this money  were  to be used by,  say,  guerrilla  forces to intercept arms from Nicara gua leading to El Salvador, by, let us  say, blowing up a warehouse, and let  us say the warehouse was guarded by  armed personnel of  the Nicaraguan  Government and there was good infor mation that warehouse was being used  to  supply  other Central American  countries, would  that be  terrorism  under this?

154,House,98,-0.095,498,6,Mr. JONES of Oklahoma.," Mr.  Speaker, the difference in House Con current Resolution 280 and 282 is that  House Concurrent Resolution 280  is  the basic committee bill with the pay as-you-go committee amendment, that  we passed in committee, incorporated  into it. House Concurrent Resolution  282 is the basic committee bill without  the committee pay-as-you-go amend ment.  I think the gentleman is well aware  of that.  If the gentleman desires not to have  the pay-as-you-go amendment,  there  are at  least  two  substitutes which  would take that out and would freeze  spending.  So that is the explanation. It is not a  gimmick. As a matter of fact,  if the  House in Gramm-Latta l, 3 years ago,  had put ourselves  and our budget  process on a pay-as-you-go basis, per haps we would not be facing such un precedented Federal deficits.

156,House,98,0.353,498,6,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Speaker,  this  rule does not provide for openness and  fair deliberations. Extensive debate is  allowed, and we will have no less than  eight budget options from which  to  choose. The ""last passed wins"" rule is  not perfect. but it far surpasses last  ",1984
157,House,98,0.3,511,6,Mr. KEMP.," I thank the gentleman  for his comments, and he brings up  something that I talked about a little  bit earlier, which is the importance of  monetary policy in reaching an equi librium in the budget battle.  I know this shocks some of my more  orthodox friends, but I do not see how  the deficit could have caused interest  to go up in 1979 and 1980 and 1981. In terest rates were higher where the def icit was lower, and vice versa. But if  you look back at the history of the  Federal funds  rate,  targeted by  the  Fed, look at the discount rate which is  set by the Fed, in 1979, it went from  single digit to double digits when the  deficit was the smallest in the last 10  years.  The Federal funds rate was kept at  about 15 percent on average  for 3  years. What happened is that it killed  the housing industry, the auto indus try, the steel industry, it caused the  collapse in farm prices, it caused the  collapse  in  our  agricultural  trade  policy, and unemployment went from  about 6 to 11 percent. According to the  CBO, five points of unemployment is  at least $150 billion of deficit.  The gentleman from Illinois is right:  Get unemployment down, and you will  get the deficit down. Yes, we need to  cut spending; yes we should be con cerned about those out of work; yes we  should be concerned about  training,  and  I will  join any person on  this  floor, left, right, or center, in coming  up with the right kind of job training.  I have mentioned his name a couple  of times. I think it is only fair before I  yield to my colleagues on the right,  that I yield to Mr. SIMON from Illinois  for a question.  ",1984

Here we are  with what usually is a 4-hour debate  on Humphrey-Hawkins that has been  cut down to an hour and a half.  ",1984

161,House,98,-0.291,524,6,Mr. DONNELLY.," I thank the chair man for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  to be very  frank,  when this year began I was very skep tical, as a member of the Budget Com mittee, that this institution would be  willing and able to achieve any sort of  deficit reduction due to the political  and economic circumstances that we  faced as Congress convened. We had  $200 deficits annualized out as far as  you could see, probably a very heated  and bitter Presidential election on the  horizon, congressional elections  that  are now taking place in primaries and  taking place in November, a  very serious clash of economic and  monetary policy differences between  the parties and, in fact, between indi viduals on both sides of the aisle.  I  think  this  institution  and  the  Budget Committee as a whole deserve  a great deal of credit for focusing the  attention of the membership on the  critical problem that this Nation and  the economic recovery in this ?fation  faces because of these enormous defi cits that have been accruing over the  last few years and will continue  to  accrue unless we have  the political  courage to do something about it.  So step one is that we are moving in  the right direction. The debate today  is what it ought to be about, and that  is what are  the priorities  that we  will be  ",1984
162,House,98,0.425,550,6,Mr. LOEFFLER.," I thank my distin guished minority  leader for yielding  me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I have got to ask the  question: Why should anyone support  the pending amendment? Quite frank ly, the form that this amendment has  been submitted to us on the floor is  not one that is serious. If those of you  on the majority side were serious in  putting together this amendment, you  would  have  included  reconciliation  procedures to enforce the savings as sumed in the budget resolution.  The gentleman who  just preceded  me in the well from the State of Mon tana enjoyed exploiting the issue but  would never place the budget in ques tion in any real jeopardy of being im plemented. So, it remains for this gen tleman to ask the question: What is  the matter, were you afraid that if  this had been considered in a serious  manner, with full enforcement proce dures, that it might have passed?  Compare what  the President has  done with respect to the deficit reduc tion activities this year, with this friv olous exercise by the majority party.  The President has been serious. On  January 25, he came  to  this  floor.  During his State of the Union address  to the Nation, he said, and I quote:  We must bring down the deficit to insure  continued economic growth. In the budget  that I will submit on February l, I will rec ommend measures that will reduce the defi cit over the next 5 years. Many of these will  be unfinished  business  from  last year's  budget. Some could be enacted quickly if we  could Join in a serious effort to address this  problem.  I  spoke  today with Speaker O'NEILL,  Senate Majority Leat!~r BAKER, Senate Mi nority Leader BYRI>, and House Minority  lAade~ M1CHEL. I asked them if they would  ~signate congressional  representatives  to  meet with representatives of the administra tion to try to reach prompt agreement on a  bipartisan deficit downpayment plan.  I know it will take a long, hard struggle to  agree on a full-scale plan. So, what I have  proposed is that we first see if we can agree  on a downpayment.  Now, I believe there is basis for such an  agreement. One that could reduce the defi cits by $100 billion over the next 3 years. If  the congressional leadership is willing, my  representatives will be prepared  to meet  with theirs at the earliest possible time. I  would hope the leadership might agree on  an expeditious timetable in which to devel op and enact that down payment.  Now, what has happened since Janu ary 25? Representatives of the admin istration and Representatives from my  party were serious in their efforts to  negotiate. The majority party here in  this Chamber was not serious, and  therefore, we did not make a $100 bil lion deficit down payment in a biparti san manner.  So,  the  President  came  forward  again, and he announced that if the  majority party  in  the House  is not  willing to negotiate in a serious way,  then he would work with the Senate  leadership and with  the Republican  minority in the House and come up  with a $150 billion deficit reduction.  D 1820  That is being serious. Again, to the  majority: When you off er an amend ment, be serious in your intentions or  be straight forward about the charade  you are engaged in.  ",1984
163,House,98,-0.293,550,6,Mr. WIRTH.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 3  minutes  to  the  gentleman  from  Oregon <Mr. AuCoIN).  Mr. AuCOIN. I thank the gentleman  for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, we have been hearing  a  lot of crowing about Presidential  leadership over  the  last 3 years.  I  would remind my colleagues that one  of the powers of a Presidential leader  is his power to present a budget laying  out the direction he proposes for this  country.  The Constitution gives that power to  the President. It does not give it to the  President and Mr. LATTA; it gives it to  the President of the United States.  The President's budget, any Presi dent's budget, is the major fiscal docu ment of any session of Congress. It is  the point of reference. This budget  happens to be $192 billion out of bal ance.  I am astonished that some Republi cans are now asking why it is that we,  in the House, should vote on the Presi dent's budget. Well, I  remember the  ringing words of the President when  he addressed the joint session of the  Congress and ushered in his revolution  which gives us these staggering budget  deficits.  I would answer the Republican mi nority leader's question when he says,  why should we vote on the President's  budget, by repeating the words of the  President at that time. The President  said: ""If not we, who? If not now,  when?""  ",1984

It is not  in the Constitution. It is in the Budget  Act of 1921. It is not in the Constitu tion, though.  As far as who  is playing fast and  loose around here, I submit that the  Congress ls the guilty party. The Con gress has for years rejected Presidents'  budgets, as my colleagues on the other  side of  the aisle  rejected President  Carter's budgets, and year after year  spent more than he requested.  In fiscal year 1980, for instance, he  requested $531.6 billion. The Congress  went over  that by $47.6 billion.  fiscal year 1981, he requested $651 bil lion and Congress went over it by $45  billion.  ",1984

Ira  Gallaway, pastor of the First United  Methodist Church in Peoria, Ill., was a  member of the U.S. delegation which  observed the recent elections in El Sal vador. Dr. Gallaway, who has previ ously visited  that country, was very  impressed by the people of El Salvador  and their desire for democratic government and peace. I  think all our col leagues would benefit by reading an  account of his observations, as pub lished in the Peoria Journal Star.  At this time, I wish to insert in the  RECORD, ""Elections Stand for Modera tion"" by Elaine Hopkins,  from  the  Peoria Journal Star, March 29, 1984.  ELECTIONS STAND FOR MODERATION  <By Elaine Hopkins)  Sunday's election  in El Salvador repre sented ""a definite 'no' to the extremism of  the  right  and  left,""  says  the Rev.  Ira  Gallaway, pastor of the First United Meth odist Church of Peoria.  Dr. Gallaway was part of a U.S. State De partment delegation observing the election.  The 31-member group arrived in El Salvador  Saturday and  left Monday after visiting  seven municipalities Sunday to observe the  voting.  ""We  talked  to people directly. We had  many  conversations"" with  all  sorts  of  people, Gallaway said.  Everywhere people told him, ""We're here  to vote for freedom, we're here to vote for  democracy, we want peace,"" Gallaway said.  Delegation members were able  to  leave  the group and talk to people independently  and privately, he said. ""We talked to old  people, young people, middle-aged people.  You can tell whether they're being forced to  do something,"" the minister said.  Though citizens are required to vote in El  Salvador, ""people said no punitive measures  were taken against those who didn't vote,""  he said.  People seemed to be committed to demo cratic  processes,  Gallaway  said.  ""One  woman told me she walked <14 miles> and  stood  three hours  in  line""  to vote. ""It's  worth  it.  It's for  freedom  and  peace,""  Gallaway said the woman told him.  He said he received the impression ""the  leftists do not control  the mind of  the  people."" He visited with labor leaders and  others, and everywhere people said they op posed military dictatorship  and did not  want to go back to an oligarchy or a govern ment run by wealthy intesests. But they are  also opposed to Marxist rule involving state  control, he said.  Gallaway said he saw ""bureaucratic bun gling"" and problems with a U.S.-supplied  computer which was  supposed  to aid  in  voting. But  the  committee  unanimously  agreed the election was a ""step towards pos sible democratic rule  in El Salvador,"" he  said.  ""There's no insurance that peace is going  to come to that country. This is a step in  their possible democratic future.""  Gallaway said he saw no indication of vote  fraud. Every ballot box was watched by rep resentatives of all eight political parties,  and they were ""watching each other with  apparent good humor,"" he said.  Leftists  boycotted  the  election,  saying  ""they would have exposed themselves""  to  reprisals, he said.  ""I hope people of this country are aware  of how precious freedom is,"" he said. People  here take such processes as voting for grant ed, and many do not bother to leave their  comfortable homes to vote, he said. But in  El Salvador, ""I see people struggling to gain  freedom,"" he said. There is ""a great commit ment on the part of many people to voting.""  Gallaway has been on a speaking tour in  Michigan, but plans  to  arrive  in Peoria  today.e  ",1984
170,,98,-0.473,615,6,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker,  last  week I was unavoidably absent for the  House vote on H.R. 3755, the Disabil ity Benefit Reform Act of 1984. Had I  been present I would have joined the  majority of my colleagues who voted  overwhelmingly to pass the bill.  The need for immediate reform in  the disability review program cannot  be overstated. This  administration's  attempts to reduce the disability rolls  have  imposed  terrible hardships on  thousands  of worthy  beneficiaries.  Hundreds of thousands of people have  been denied benefits to which they are  entitled. These are people who are se verely disabled, who cannot work, who  depend upon  the social security dis ability system for their very existence,  and who previously worked and earned  their right to be protected from eco nomic disaster in the event of severe  disability.  When Congress passed the disability  amendments in 1980, the intent was to  carefully review the medical eligibility  of  those persons  receiving disability  benefits and to ferret out fraud. The  result, however, has been nothing less  than a wholesale purge of the disabil ity rolls. The benefits of deserving re cipients are being terminated because  of flawed procedures, poor data and  arbitrary  decisionmaking.  There  is  simply no excuse for this.  Steps must be  taken to put more  consistency, equity, and administrative  control  into  the  review process.  properly structured a review program  can be implemented successfully with out jeopardizing the rights of the dis abled who legitimately depend on dis ability for their life support. H.R. 3755  offers this kind of framework. It pro vides important safeguards for individ uals who are subject  to  review and  issues specific guidelines to eliminate  the choas which continues to plague  the program. It deserves the undivided  attention of the Senate.e  If  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.EDWARDJ.MARKEY  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 4, 1984  ",1984

I request that  this letter be reprinted following my  statement because I share the Agricul ture Committee members' concerns  about proposals contained in the Su perfund legislation that will eliminate  the tax exclusion for chemicals used in  the production of farmer used f ertiliz ers. I am alarmed that this particular  provision of H.R. 4813 will unnecessar ily  increase  agricultural  production  costs by approximately $142 million  per year-a cost that my Mississippi  farmers  and other  farmers  in our  country cannot afford.  I believe that it is very important  that  the House  of Representatives  proceed expeditiously with the reau thorization of Superfund, and I fully  support this effort. However, I would  like to point out that the 1980 debate  on Superfund clearly identified the va lidity of a  tax exclusion for farmer  used fertilizers. The record in 1980 was  clear that a fertilizer exemption was  justified, and I believe that the record  today is clear that the exemption is  still justified.  I want to thank the members of the  House Agriculture Committee-in par ticular my  colleagues Congressman  Bedell and Congressman Madigan-for  bringing this problem to our attention.

So with that $6 billion  we then generate a program that puts  those, say, 1,800 workers to work not  building the B-1 bomber but moving  to a reconversion approach where we  talk about building peaceful approach es to life.  The gentlewomen raises an excellent  question. But what we are saying in  this budget is that we have an answer  to  that,  to free our colleagu~s from  the more pedestrian, mundane politi cal consideration of whether people  lose jobs in their districts, and are able  to make  the policy decision  as  to  whether we need a weapon system.  And if that has an adverse impact on  the  local  community, we  generate  funds so that people do not lose jobs.  The gentlewomen's point is well taken,  but we try to deal with it.  ",1984
177,House,98,-0.45,654,6,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Chairman, there are  a number of amendments today which  are legitimate efforts to unite liberals  and conservatives alike to attack the  deficit problem  in a  realistic way.  I  think the MacKay amendment is one,  for instance, because it defines budget  baselines above which we should not  be spending without new taxes to fi nance that spending. But that has a  problem in that it leaves no real nego tiating room with the Senate for prior ity adjustment. The McHugh amend ment most accurately reflects my view  of what this House ought to be able to  minimally achieve by way of attacks  on the deficit.  But I frankly believe that the Dixon  amendment is best in terms of depart ing  from  the  timidity which  has  plagued this town and which has pre vented us from  really attacking the  budget deficit  in a  really dramatic  way.  I do not agree with some of the mili tary assumptions made in this budget.  I certainly do not agree with some of  the domestic numbers, and I specifical ly do not agree with the estate tax  suggestions or the agricultural area,  for  instance,  and  I  have questions  about some of the social spending that  is suggested. But the amendment  is  preferable  to other alternatives  for  one basic  reason: This  is  the only  amendment before us  that makes a  sufficiently dramatic attack on  the  deficit to really make an economic dif ference.  I would also point out, for those of  you who have concerns about specifics  within this resolution, that the jour ney is not determined by where you  start;  the  journey  is determined by  where you wind up. And this is the  only alternative before us which gives  us an opportunity, through the confer ence process with the Senate, to wind  up where we ought to be, with much  larger deficit reductions than we will  have under any other alternative, and  also  gives  us  the  opportunity  to  thank  produce a mix of military and domes tic programs that has some degree of  social equity. It also, I believe, is the  only one of the alternatives that suffi ciently  recognizes  that concurrently  with budget deficit reductions we also  have  to make  some  specific  invest ments in areas that are essential for  the future growth of  the economy,  those  three being education, health  and manpower.  I have  just come from a meeting  with Nobel Laureates who have laid  out the dramatic shortcomings in the  budget  on  basic  health  research.  There is only one budget alternative  before us which allows us  to meet  those needs within the context of a  greatly reduced budget deficit. This is  the alternative, and I would urge the  Members' support for it on that basis.  ",1984
178,House,98,-0.308,667,6,Mr. PEASE.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the McHugh substitute. I  have just come from hearings in the  Trade Subcommittee where we heard  the chief executive officers of  four  major American corporations talking  about the problem of trade deficits.  Our merchandise trade deficit was $69  billion  last year. The estimates are  that it will go up to $125 billion this  year. These corporate officers told us  that  that will  have  a  devastating  effect on our economy. The one con crete step which they told us we could  It  take to reverse this trend is to reduce  Federal deficits.  I believe that with the McHuGH sub stitute we have a realistic opportunity  to do  that. The McHugh substitute  balances the sacrifice between defense  spending and domestic  spending.  does not ask for a disproportionate  share from either side.  In addition  to  that,  the McHugh  substitute provides for $76 billion in  revenue over the next 3 years, which,  as the gentleman from New York <Mr.  MCHUGH) has pointed out, surely  is  not an excessive amount when you  consider that the 1981 tax bill alone  will result in a loss of revenue of some  $490 billion over the same period of  time.  We all know that we are going to  have  to  take  a  three-pronged  ap proach;  cutting  back  on  domestic  spending, restricting the growth of de fense spending and increasing revenue  if we are to get the deficits under con trol.  The chief  executive officers with  whom we talked this morning empha sized that we do not have much time;  we must get the deficit down as soon  as possible. The McHugh substitute  gives us the best opportunity.  The CHAffiMAN. The time of the  gentleman from Ohio <Mr. PEASE) has  expired.  ",1984
179,House,98,-0.472,667,6,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the McHugh substitute.  Mr. Chairman, I would just like to  say I  think this is the most creative  initiative we have before us. I want to  first of all give credit where credit is  due,  to  the Budget Committee  in  terms of the work they have done in  terms of domestic spending, because  this proposal tracks that proposal for  a 3-year change in domestic spending.  Many of the proposals have been legis lative initiatives that have passed and  realistically we a1e taking them into  consideration with this particular sub stitute.  But additionally, this substitute ad dresses  the other issues more eff ec tively in terms of dealing with other  problems on fiscal policy; namely, the  issue of defense spending and the issue  of taxes.  The tax dollars that are gained in  this particular measure is dedicated to  the reduction of the deficit.  Mr. Chairman, I think for too long  we  have  been measuring  defense  spending with  a  13-inch  ruler and  measuring domestic spending with an  11-inch ruler. I think it is high time we  began to face up to this. Because if we  do not face the crunch right now in  this year with regard to defense spend ing, it is simply going to be compound ed in the future years.  So I think it is time to address run away military spending and place real istic  limits  on  the  tremendous  in creases of the past 4 years. This meas ure keeps military spending exactly  where it is today with the adjustments  provided for only inflation.  Frankly,  I  think that that is ade quate. All  too often  the bargaining  chips have become weapons  in  the  field,  and some day  like almost all  military weapons the real possibility  exists for their use.  Today as we  focus on the budget  issue this measure provides the great est reduction of any of the remaining  budget measures to be considered it  means that we began today not after  the November  elections,  but  today  facing up to the reality of taxes and  spending.  I urge my colleagues sup port.  Mr. McHUGH. Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut <Mr. McKINNEY).  Mr. McKINNEY. Mr. Chairman, it  seems to me that even though politics  as usual is part of the structure of this  House, and it seems to be where we  are coming from, once again, particu larly with the antics yesterday on the  original Reagan budget. The politics  as usual is not what is going on in the  Fourth Congressional District of the  State of Connecticut.  My people are tired of budget defi cits,  they are  tired of an overrated  American dollar because of these defi cits and high interest rates, which is  robbing Americans of jobs, trade, and  opportunity;  they  are  tired of not  being able to buy a house; and they  are tired of paying too much for a car.  In essense,  they are tired of Con gress not facing up to its responsibil ities.  I consider myself a good Republican,  though some might argue that point.  And I stand full square behind the  McHugh  substitute and  full  square  behind,  if  that does not pass,  the  MacKay substitue; as the only two re alistic documents that have appeared  in front of this body since the begin ning of this debate.  First off. some of you are going to  use the excuse that we have decimated  the Defense Department. Gentlemen  and ladies, please, the Pentagon has  had  a  41-percent  increase  in  real  spending power over the last 3 years.  I  ",1984
180,House,98,0.23,706,6,Mr. WYLIE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of  the Latta substitute.  I want to compliment my friend the  gentleman from Ohio. He is my next  door neighbor and I know of the hard  work,  care,  persistence,  and under standing that he has put into his sub stitute proposal.  On Monday  I  spoke  to  the U.S.  League of Savings Associations. On  Tuesday I spoke to the Ohio Bankers  Association and 2 weeks ago I spoke to  the American Council of Life Insur ance Agents.  These groups are made up of people  who make  a  living  adjusting  to  changes  in  interest  rates  in  the  months and years ahead. They are the  market place. Each group told me the  single most serious problem facing our  Nation is the size of the budget deficit.  I happen to believe they are right and  said so.  On a  recent questionnaire,  I  sent  out, most of those responding said the  budget deficit is our most serious na tional problem. So to represent my dis trict, I must try to do something about  it.  The savings and loan industry is particularly  sensitive  to  interest  rate  changes.  I was  told  in no uncertain  terms  that if Congress does not do  something about the deficit,  interest  rates will surely rise, maybe not this  year, but certainly early next year,  and a lot of savings and loans will go  out of business.  In each group  the  first question  asked was: Did I think Congress would  pass a budget which would substan tially reduce the deficit?  In answer to the question, I said I  was very apprehensive that we would  not, and that is why I have introduced  House  Joint Resolution  382  as  a  backup  to provide  for a Bipartisan  Budget  Reduction  Commission  to  come up with a package we can vote  on-up or down-like the Commission  which came up with a package to solve  the social security funding problem: A  plan to take the problem out of the  partisan political arena.  The reason I am doubtful that we  can pass a budget, and I hope I am  wrong, is because budgets are bloom ing like flowers in spring. I said there  is much partisan bickering about just  who is to blame.  The President  is being blamed by  some. But the fact  is  that Congress  has simply never had the courage to  cut spending, even though it became a  full partner in the budget process in  1974.  In this substitute which Congress man LATTA offers, President Reagan  has made some large concessions and  agreed to hold down defense spending  by a considerable amount. The Presi dent first thought the increase in de fense should be about 13 percent.  I  thought that was too much and said  so. The Latta substitute represents a  7.1 percent increase over 3 years; 7.1  percent may be  too much.  I would  have preferred 5 percent. But it is a  fact that in the wake of Vietnam, Con gress reduced defense spending drasti cally so that many of our major weap ons were becoming seriously outdated.  The  B-52,  our major  long-range  bomber, was older than many of the  pilots who were flying  it. Our Navy  was allowed to dwindle to 400 ships,  down from over 900 previously, and  many of our aircraft were out of serv ice due to the lack of spare parts and  trained personnel to maintain them.  Unlike  the 1950's when nearly 40  percent of our national budget was de voted to defense, we are now spending  far more on domestic health, welfare,  and social programs than is allocated  to defense.  So-called entitlements make up 48  percent of this budget. Defense 27 per cent. So controllables only represent  25 percent of the budget.  The significant  thing here  is  the  President has agreed to support a re duction of $40 billion in defense from  his first budget to get a compromise.  The President's plan would cut $49  billion  from domestic spending  this  year, and  tax  revenues would  raise  $47 .2 billion over 3 years including in terest savings that adds up to $204.5  billion in total deficit reduction over 3  years. The President has made an other concession on agreeing  to  in crease tax revenues.  The  deficit will  not  be  reduced  unless something is done to slow the  growth of Federal  spending or  in crease revenues or both.  My constituents feel we can close a  few loopholes and increase the tax on  alcohol and tobacco, to help keep in terest rates down, and that is what  this package would do.  The President has been willing  to  compromise on  this  important  issue  and I hope we will see some compro mise on the other side. If Congress  does not meet the President halfway  on reducing deficits, we could see run away interest rates and growing unem ployment again.  We cannot let that happen.  Congress must act responsibly and  lend  its hand  to  reduce  the deficit.  This is a good compromise. I urge its  adoption.  ",1984
181,House,98,-0.258,706,6,Mr. PANETTA.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the chairman of the committee  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, some comments were  made with regard to enforcement pro visions.  I want to make clear to the  Members that the enforcement proce dures, whether you are looking at the  Latta substitute or the committee bill,  roughly  correspond  to  each  other.  There are really two enforcement pro visions that we have in terms of en forcing the provisions of any budget  resolution that is adopted. One is rec onciliation and the second deals with  the 302 allocations  that flow  to the  Appropriations Committee. Those are  really the two key tools that are used  by  the Budget Committee  in  the  budget process and,  indeed, by  the  House in terms of enforcing the tar gets that are contained in the budget  resolution.  Now, with  regard  to  the Budget  Committee proposal, we feel confident  that both of those tools can be used  and used effectively. As a matter of  fact, with regard to reconciliation, it is  our full intention next week to take up  a reconciliation bill that has $12.3 bil lion in savings. That is not all from  last year. About $9  to $10 billion of  that will be new savings recommended  by  the  eight  committees  that  are  under instructions with regard to rec onciliation; so next week there will be  a spending savings bill of approximately $12.3 billion that will be before the  House.  In addition to that, we have a reve nue bill that will raise approximately  $49 billion. Those  two  together will  ",1984
182,House,98,-0.306,719,6,Mr. BOLAND.," Mr. Speaker, I  take  this opportunity to  join with Chair man WHITTEN, Mr.  CONTE, and others in their comments  about Pete Murphy, the staff director  of  the Defense Appropriations Sub committee, who  died  of  cancer on  Tuesday morning.  Pete Murphy combined all the quali ties that made an outstanding member  of  the  Appropriations  Committee  staff. He was  hard working-often  here on evenings and weekends. He  was  an  expert budget  technician dedicated  to  uncovering  the  issues,  that lay behind hundreds of millions,  yea, billions of dollars of budget re quests.  And Pete knew his subject matter as  well as any one in this town. From re search and development, through the  maze of DOD procurement-Pete had  a fine grasp of every program-wheth er it was the smallest handgun or the  B-lB bomber. He was also responsible  for  the Appropriation Committee's  review of the intelligence community,  and worked closely with the staff and  members of the House Select Commit tee on Intelligence.  His recommendations to the commit tee and to the Congress were marked  with a  thoroughness of review and a  careful understanding of what was the  right thing to do. And, Mr. Speaker,  above  all, Pete's  integrity  and  his  sense of honesty will be remembered.  No one who knew him, or who worked  with him-eould not come away with a  a  ""straight  feeling  that Pete was  shooter.""  Pete served in the Marine Corps in  the Pacific during World War II. He  saw action on both Guadalcanal and  the invasion of Bougainville. He also  participated in the Guam invasion and  the  invasion of Iwo Jima-where he  was wounded in an assault on an Iwo  Jima airfield.  Mr. Speaker,  in  John Kennedy's  first state of the Union delivered from  the podium behind me, he said:  Let  the public service be a proud and  lively career. And let every man and woman  who works in any area of our national gov ernment, in any branch, at any level, be able  to say with pride and with honor in future  years: ""I served  the U.S. Government  that hour of our nation's need.""  in  Pete Murphy was  that kind of a  public servant-and his 22 years as a  special agent with the Federal Bureau  of Investigation-and his 16 years as a  staff member of the House Appropria tions Committee are a  testament to  President Kennedy's words.  Finally, although Pete devoted the  best years of his life to his work-it  was his family that he loved and cared  for above all. He died at home with his  family as he wanted to, and our deep est sympathy goes out to his wife Eve  and their six children, Daniel P., Mi chael J., James P., Mary Ellen, Kath leen M., and Patricia.  We will all miss him very much.  THAILAND RECOGNIZED FOR  REFUGEE EFFORTS  <Mr. McCOLLUM  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, next  week our Nation will have the pleas ure of welcoming  the distinguished  Prem Tinsulanonda, Prime Minister of  Thailand.  On this occasion, I would like to take  a moment to recognize the Nation of  Thailand's truly outstanding accom plishments in the area of refugee re settlement-a subject  I  am well ac quainted with as a member of the Im migration Subcommittee.  For many years now, Thailand has  been a haven for thousands and thou sands of refugees from Vietnam, Kam puchea, and Laos who have fled Com munist terror and oppression. For any  nation,  such an  influx would pose  enormous logistical and organizational  problems and would require a major  commitment  on  the  part  of  that  nation to undertake the challenge of  overcoming them. Thailand has done  exactly that. Faced with responsibility  for the lives of thousands of homeless  and desperate men, women, and chil dren, Thailand has helped them begin  new lives with competence, efficiency,  and understanding. It has worked tire lessly  to house,  feed,  and care  for  these refugees and find new homes in  other countries.  Unfortunately,  Thailand's  excep tional efforts do not make the front  pages of the newspapers very often; in  fact, we rarely hear about the work  being done every day of the year to  bring order and stability back to the  lives of refugees with no place to go.  We do hear about the tragedies which  all  to often occur when people are  forced to flee as quickly as they can in  any manner that they are able to find.  But, we do not hear about the families  that are  fortunate  enough  to  find  their way into a well-coordinated re settlement process such as Thailand's,  and are quietly assisted in beginning a  new life. There are thousands of these  success stories taking place every year.  The nation of Thailand should be  commended for the truly excellent hu manitarian  resettlement program  it  has developed and for its proven abili ty to handle what is indeed an awe some  responsibility. Many  nations  have assisted the refugees of Vietnam,  Kampouchea and Laos, but none more  valiantly or with greater compassion.  Faced with the challenge of meeting  the needs of  thousands of  refugees  without homes-and without hope Thailand has risen to the occasion in a  manner which should be an example  to all nations. I urge my colleagues to  join me in recognizing the nation of  Thailand and its outstanding contribu tion to humanity.

186,Senate,98,0.213,771,6,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President,  I  support this amendment on impact aid  offered  by my  distinguished  col leagues. The importance of impact aid  to South Dakota is very clear. Our res ervation  schools  and  the Douglas  School,  serving Ellsworth Air Force  Base, rely heavily on impact aid as a  source of revenue. Threatening to im plement a new method of establishing  payment rates in the middle of the  year sends the wrong message to these  schools.  The impact aid school districts are  already 9 months into a budget year.  It is unfair for the U.S. Department of  Education to attempt to make rate al terations  for  the present year. The  amendment sends a clear message to  the Department: Do not change the  method for establishing payment rates  in the middle of a budget year.  There are  several  school districts  scattered across my State that have a  substantial amount of nontaxable Fed eral property. Impact aid helps com pensate for the loss of tax revenue on  this property. In some districts, most  of  the  financial  support  for  the  schools comes from impact aid. There  are simply no alternatives for  these  schools.  Many South Dakota schools would  be forced to close if Federal impact aid  assistance were discontinued. Even the  threat of major rate changes can be  very destabilizing to them. They are  constantly forced to deal with uncer tainty  about Federal  intentions  in  planning budgets.  I  have  joined  in  sponsoring this amendment because I  believe it will send a decisive message  to the U.S. Department of Education.  I urge my colleagues to join me in sup porting this amendment.  ",1984

188,,98,-0.547,992,6,Mr. BONIOR of Michigan.," Mr.  Speaker, in the past few years, Con gress and  the people of the United  States have become increasingly aware  of the suffering of El Salvador. Inter nationally  recognized human  rights  organizations  have  documented  the  fact that nearly 40,000 noncombatant  civilians have been killed by Govern ment forces since 1979. Hundreds of  thousands of Salvadorans have  fled  the country, seeking refuge from the  political violence.  Over 18,000 Salvadorans are now  living as refugees in camps in Hondu ras where, with the help of interna tional relief organizations, they have  built an infrastructure of schools, gar dens, water systems, et cetera. Yet, the  possibility of seeking safe haven  in  Honduras  is now  in  jeopardy. The  Honduran Government has announced  plans  to  relocate  the  refugees  to a  remote area in the interior of Hondu ras.  I would like to call the attention of  my colleagues to the following article  from  the Miami Herald which de scribes some of the difficulties this re location would cause. If the relocation  goes  forward,  thousands of refugees  will no longer feel they have access to  safe haven in Honduras.  It is time for the United States to  address the refugee problem in a re sponsible manner. We must show a  new sensitivity to the human costs of  our policies in El Salvador and Hondu ras. And we must acknowledge  the  dangers  that Salvadorans who have  sought refuge in the United States will  face if our current policy of deporta tion continues.  I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation introduced by Congressman  MOAKLEY, H.R. 4447, which would sus pend  the deportation of Salvadoran  refugees, and would direct the Presi dent to report to Congress on whether  April 5, 1984  the humanitarian and security condi tions in El Salvador and other Central  American countries are safe enough to  warrant the return of these refugees.  CFrom the Miami Herald, Mar. 9, 19841  HONDURAS To MOVE REFUGEES AWAY FROM  BORDERS  <By Juan 0. Tamayo)  TEGUCIGALPA, HONDURAS.-Worried  about  the security of its borders, the Honduran  government is planning to relocate 18, 700  refugees-almost  all  Salvadorans-away  from the frontier and into an isolated valley  in central Honduras.  The United Nations Office of High Com missioner for Refugees <UNHCR> grudging ly has endorsed  the  forced  exodus, but  asked the government to put in writing its  promises of farmland and freedom of move ment for the refugees.  The proposed relocation underscores the  problems faced by the 18,200 Salvadoran  refugees in Honduras-a small part of the  500,000 people estimated to have fled the  tiny nation since 1979 to escape its violence.  While Honduras' conservative government  is friendly toward the 25,000 refugees who  came here from Marxist-ruled Nicaragua, it  suspects many of the Salvadorans of help ing the leftist guerrillas in their homeland.  The bodies of 12 Salvadoran men and  women who had been shot were found last  month near the Mesa Grande refugee camp,  40 miles from the Salvadoran border. The  Honduran army has said it is investigating  the slayings.  UNHCR's Tegucigalpa office said the first  phase of the refugee resettlement, to begin  in June, would relocate 8, 737 Salvadorans  and 494 Guatemalans now living in three  camps within three miles of the border with  their home countries.  The second stage will relocate 9,500 Salva dorans living in Mesa Grande, said UNHCR  deputy chief Alfredo del Rio. He stressed  that the second stage would start only if the  first was judged to be successful.  Del Rio said all the refugees would be re settled near the town of Olanchito, in a fer tile but remote and thinly populated valley  140 miles from the Salvadoran border and  111 miles from Guatemala.  The three camps to be emptied-Colomon cagua and San Antonio near El Salvador  and El Tesoro near Guatemala-will be  turned into ""reception centers,"" where Hon duran officials will process newly arrived  refugees.  Spokesmen for  the Salvadoran refugees,  who asked to remain anonymous, charged  that the relocation plan was politically mo tivated and complained it would make it dif ficult for relatives still  in El Salvador to  visit them.  They alleged  that the border area was  being cleared because U.S. and Honduran  troops planned to intervene militarily in El  Salvador's guerrilla war. Both U.S. and Hon duran officials denied any such plans.  About  troops  from  the United  States, Honduras, El Salvador and Guate mala will hold joint military maneuvers in  May and June near Cucuyagua, 28 miles  from the Salvadoran border.  The Honduran National Commission on  Refugees has denied any political motives  for the relocation and said it is designed to  move the refugees to an area where they  can grow their own food.  Del Rio said UNHCR policy was to reset tle refugees away from the border-to pro3,500  ",1984
189,,98,-0.506,1005,6,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I am deeply concerned about  the events of  the past week which  have taken us one step closer to an all out arms race in space. The adminis tration released a report on March 31,  entitled ""U.S. Policy on ASAT Arms  Control,""  as  required  by Congress  before $20 million in antisatellite proEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  curement funds could be released. The  report makes it clear that the adminis tration has no intention of seeking ne gotiations with the Soviet Union on  ASAT's.  Under  another  provision  passed by Congress,  the administra tion is required to endeavor ""in good  faith to negotiate a mutual and verifi able ban"" on all ASAT's before the  weapon can be tested against an object  in space.  Also disturbing was the appointment  of Air Force Lt. Gen.  James A.  Abrahamson,  formerly  associate  ad ministrator of NASA for space flight,  as the director of the Strategic De fense  Initiative <SDI>. This appoint ment  is premature in that Congress  has not yet approved funds for  this  enormously expensive program.  In a bipartisan effort to slow the ac celerating arms race in space, 19 of my  colleagues and I have formed the Coa lition for the Peaceful Uses of Space.  Noted  individuals  and organizations  are also  involved in this effort. The  coalition's objectives  include the fol lowing: Achievement of a mutual U.S. U.S.S.R. test moratorum of antisatel lite  <ASAT) weapons  and  a U.S. U.S.S.R. negotiated ban on ASATs;  achievement of a funding cap on De partment of Defense fiscal year 1985  strategic defense programs aimed or  based in space; renewed commitment  of  the United States  to  the ABM  Treaty; and finally a ban of weapons  of all kinds from or directed toward  space. I urge my colleagues to join me  in pursuing these objectives.  For nearly 40 years the nuclear arms  race  between  the  superpowers  has  been waged.  This  dangerous  and  wasteful nuclear crusade must come to  an end. At no other time in the past 40  years have we had a better opportuni ty to put a stop to arms prolif era ti on  than we do now. The growing nuclear  stockpiles  in  the United States and  U.S.S.R. have become redundant be cause of the overkill factor. Programs  to use new technologies for missile de fense, such as ASA T's and the Strate gic Defense Initiative, are still in the  initial phase of development-slowing  these programs down now would be  much easier than waiting until they  are fully operational.  Below is a list of my colleagues who  have already joined the effort to keep  space free of weapons.  I would also  urge my colleagues to review the fol lowing article.

[From the Peninsula Times Tribune, Mar.  11, 1984]  A Focus ON ARMs CONTROL Is MORE  REALISTIC  <By Sidney Drem  President Reagan's call to shift from de terrence based on the threat of nuclear re taliation to reliance on defense against nu clear annihilation is not new. It has been re jected before on  technical  grounds: We  simply do not know how  to build such a  shield, particularly in view of the relatively  simple steps the offense can take to defeat  it. During the earlier debates it was also re alized that the pursuit of defenses-or ABM  systems-can in fact prove harmful to our  security since each nation fears the purpose  as well as the capability of its opponent's  defenses. We may believe that our defenses  enhance  deterrence  by  diminishing  the  threat of a Soviet first strike. The Soviets,  however, may see them as evidence of U.S.  preparations for a first strike, a first strike  that would leave them with a weakened re taliatory force against which our defenses,  though imperfect, would be relatively more  effective. President Nixon gave this very ra tionale  in explaining his decision not  to  deploy a nationwide ABM system in 1969  and  in negotiating  the ABM Treaty of  SALT I that is in effect today.  Since then there have been tremendous  advances in technology, which include pro ducing directed energy beams of high power  that travel as accurate bullets at the speed  of light, and more efficient gathering, proc essing, and transmitting vast quantities of  data for the purpose of battle management.  The crucial question is whether these tech nical advances offer new promise of building  an effective defensive system,  i.e., can we  now solve the problems that led us to con clude, the last time around, that an effec tive defense was impossible?  Is it universally recognized that no single  technology offers a prospect of providing an  impenetrable shield or anti-ballistic Magi not Line. Therefore the concept of a ""de fense  in depth"" has developed-Le., a de fense with several layers based on different  technologies. The important first  layer of  this system would supposedly destroy most  of  the missiles  right  after  they  are  launched. Subsequent layers would attack  the remaining warheads high above the at mosphere, and the final layer would inter cept  the  few  survivors  during  the  last  minute or two when they re-enter the at mosphere near their targets.  However, as we look at each layer of this  defense, we encounter problems of monu mental magnitude. To  take one example,  consider a space-based system orbiting the  earth and designed to attack missiles short ly after launch. The most advanced of these  concepts envisages very high-powered lasers  and large optical systems which must oper",1984

Charles McKenna  has  been  a  member in good standing of the Twin  Cities Local 512, International Associa tion of Bridge, Structural and Orna mental Iron Workers for over 40 years  and has served as an officer of local  512 for almost 30 years.  As an officer of local 512, Chuck has  been  instrumental  in  improving  the  quality of life and education for iron workers and other Minnesotans.  In large part,  through Chuck's ef forts, a strong and vibrant apprentice ship program was created. This pro gram has provided crucial training and  employment opportunities for many.  Under the direction of the joint ap prenticeship  committee,  which  he  helped  to establish and headed,  the  success of the apprenticeship program  will continue.  Chuck has served  the members of  local 512 well. Through his efforts the  membership have a model health and  welfare program as well as a  sound  pension  plan. These  benefits  have  become a benchmark for many others.  Besides serving the local 512 mem bership, Chuck McKenna has served  the people of Twin Cities area well. As  a member of the board of directors for  the McKnight Foundation, he has  been a driving force in the good works  of that organization.  Mr.  Speaker,  I  count  on Chuck  McKenna as a good friend and adviser.  I will miss his active participation in  local 512 but know  that I can still  depend on his wise counsel and experi ence.

191,,98,-0.379,1018,6,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, last De cember our community suffered a dev astating  blow  when  the  Prince  Georges County Police Department  lost a  fine officer and  leader, Maj.  Richard Beavers. Major Beavers was  struck down in a senseless robbery at tempt as he was sitting, off duty, in a  parking lot.  The loss of Major Beavers, who was  the commander of the Oxon Hill sta tion, was a tragic and shocking event.  Major Beavers was extremely popular  with his men, . and his depth of con cern in his job and in his responsibil ities created a positive feeling  in all  who knew him.  Richard Joseph Beavers joined the  police department on October 16, 1967,  and was assigned  to  the Hyattsville  station. He was promoted to detective  in the vice section  in 1970. Further  promotions were swift-in 1972, he was  promoted  to detective  first class:  in  1974, to sergeant; in 1976 to the rank  of lieutenant; and then, in 1979 to cap tain  and  transferred  to  operations  duty officer. In 1980 he was named  commander of the Clinton District sta tion, and in 1982 to the same post at  the Oxon Hill station. He was promot ed to the rank of major posthumously  in November.  Major Beavers was born and raised  in Prince Georges County, graduating  from Northwestern High School  in  1964.  In 1970 he married Diana L.  Miller  and  they had  two  children,  Joseph Richard and Shannell Shan non.  During his service in the police de partment, Major Beavers received an  Award of Merit and 24 letters of com mendation for his work. He was con sidered one of the bright young men  of the department and he was well loved by his coworkers. At the time of  his death, he was counseling a former  employee and her family.  Clearly the motive in this senseless  killing was robbery, and two men have  been arrested and charged with Major  Beavers' murder.  ",1984

Mr.  Fallick  has  been  an  active  member of the community board for  the past 7 years, serving on numerous  committees and giving countless hours  of service for  the betterment of his  neighbors and his community. Four  years ago, he took on the additional  responsibilities  inherent  in  the posi tion of chairman of  the community  board and distinguished himself in the  capacity  through his  strong,  deter mined leadership and exemplary dedi cation to duty.  However, Harold Fallick  is much  more  than  a  dedicated  community  board member and officer. He has  been an active member of the Commu nity Democratic Club for many years,  and is an active member of both the  B'nai B'rith Oceanview Lodge and the  Knights of Pythias Lodge 699.  Harold Fallick also served for many  years as the trustee of the Oceanview  Jewish Center. He is a member of the  Society of Naval Architects & Marine  Engineers and an ex-officer with the  Merchant Marines. He also served his  country with honor  in both World  War II and the Korean war.  Harold Fallick represents  the best  kind of community activist; one who  gives tirelessly of himself for the bet terment of his country and his com munity.

207,House,98,-0.271,1239,6,Mr. BOSCO.," Mr. Speaker,  today I  am introducing legislation, along with  Congressman D' AMouRs,  that  is de signed to address the controversy over  the Department of the Interior's pro posal to off er lease sales for undersea  mining on the Gorda Ridge off north ern California and Oregon. This meas ure, entitled ""the Ocean Mineral Re sources Development Act,"" would pro vide for a moratorium on Gorda Ridge  lease sales until more definitive scien tific information is gathered and ana lyzed on both the mining potential of  the site and on the environmental ef fects of such mining  In January 1984, the Minerals Man agement Service released a draft envi ronmental  impact statement <DEIS)  on the proposed lease sales. Although  the DEIS covered potential mining on  68,000 square miles beginning some 20  to 40 miles offshore, Interior has since  scaled back the proposed lease sales by  90 percent and postponed the actual  leasing until at least January 1985.  Both the DEIS and the entire leas ing plan have come under intense criti cism from environmental, fishing, and  State and  local  interests. Moreover,  the mining industry itself has viewed  the lease plan with much skepticism  and hesitancy. This widespread oppo sition to the first major non-oil or gas  offshore mineral lease is premised on  the fact that leasing at this time, for  many reasons, would be premature.  Adequate  scientific  information  is  essential  to provide a basis for  rea soned decisionmaking. As yet, howev er, there is no definitive evidence of  polymetallic sulfide minerals,  includ ing such strategic minerals as copper,  zinc,  chromium,  silver,  platinum,  nickel, and cobalt on the Gorda Ridge.  Also, as Interior's DEIS showed, very  little is known about the overall physi cal, chemical, and biological environ ment of the Gorda Ridge.  Without such scientific information,  industry  has  been  understandably  hesitant to invest capital in the type  of exploration technology necessary to  undertake  a  successful mining ven ture-particularly  at  a  time when  there is a worldwide glut of polymetal lic sulfides. In any event, it is widely  accepted  that  the  technology neces sary  for actual mining will not be  available for at least 20 years.  At the same time, concerned citizens  in California and Oregon have recog nized that an adequate assessment of  environmental  impacts  cannot  be  made until more is known about the  ore source and mining methods to be  used in development. The possible de struction of the ocean-bottom ecosys tem is of obvious concern, as are the  possible onshore pollutant effects of  polymetallic processing plants.  The commercial fishing industry, an  economic mainstay  of  California's  north coast, has also raised strong con cern over the possible effects of heavy  metal discharges on  the ocean  food  chain. The proposed  lease sale will  take  place  in  an  area of valuable  salmon, albacore, and steelhead fish ery resources, and thus more informa tion is needed on the type of extrac tion technology to be used.  Also, serious questions remain unan swered as to which Federal agency has  jurisdiction over the polymetallic min erals on the Gorda Ridge. While Inte rior  claims  jurisdiction  under  the  Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act  <OCSLA),  the Department of Com merce has historically been assigned  jurisdiction  over  the  commercial  mining of manganese nodules on the  deep seabed  from  the Deep Seabed  Hard Minerals Resources Act. This  discrepancy should be resolved before  any further research, scientific stud ies, or actual lease sales pertinent to  the Gorda Ridge area are undertaken.  Resolution of this jurisdictional prob lem should also facilitate coordination  and communication with State and  local agencies.  Finally, with little industry interest,  a  lack of basic  information, and a  worldwide glut of polymetallics, there  is reason to doubt that the Govern ment can receive anything approach ing ""fair market value"" for leases on  the Gorda Ridge. At this  time, bids  may be accepted for as little as 5 cents  an acre.  For all of these reasons, I agree with  the  overwhelming  public  consensus  that  leasing  of  the Gorda Ridge  should be delayed until  the Federal  Government resolves the many unan swered questions and concerns raised  by industry and the citizens of Califor nia and Oregon. The Ocean Minerals  Resources Development Act  is  de signed to meet these concerns.  First,  this act would prohibit lease  sales on the Gorda Ridge until such  time as the President issues a feasibili ty report to the Congress and the pro hibition is lifted by joint resolution, or  until September 30, 1988, whichever  occurs earlier.  Second,  the Department of Com merce and the Department of the In terior would be authorized to prepare  a memorandum of understanding with  respect to research and other scientific  studies pertinent to the Gorda Ridge.  This MOU is to be submitted to Con gress no later than 1 year after enact ment.  Third, the President is to submit a  Gorda Ridge feasibility report to Con gress no  later  than September 30,  1987. The preparation of this report  during the moratorium should lay a  sufficient scientific  foundation upon  which  future governmental and pri vate industry decisions can be based.  Among other things, the report must  contain a summary of the physical and  tion of what, if any, additional techbiological environment, a  determina ",1984

214,Senate,98,0.271,62,14,Mr. GORTON.," Mr. President, today  I am introducing a private bill for the  relief of Frederick and Aileen Paul of  Seattle, W A. This legislation would re lieve Mr. and Mrs. Paul of all Federal  income tax liability on sums awarded  to Mr. Paul by the Court of Claims in  1975.  Mr. Paul received this award as com pensation for 7 years of legal services  rendered on behalf of  the Alaskan  North Slope Eskimos. Mr. Paul's ef forts were largely responsible for the  passage of the Alaska Native Claims  Settlement Act and the creation of the  North Slope Borough.  Mr. Paul, who is one-fourth Tlingit  Indian, did not include his $275,000 in  legal fees in his gross income for 1975  because of a provision in the Alaska  Native Claims Settlement Act which  states:  Revenues  originating  from  the Alaska  Native Fund shall not be subject  to any  form of Federal       taxation at the time  of  receipt  by  a        individual  Native  through dividend distributions or in any  other manner. 43 U.S.C. 160<a> <emphasis  added).  He was advised by three tax attor neys that this provision would cover  his legal fees. The Internal Revenue  Service and the courts concluded, how ever,  that  his  fees were  not  tax exempt on the basis of the purpose,  context, and legislative history of this  subsection.  Because of this ruling, Mr. and Mrs.  Paul owe more than $200,000 in taxes  and interest on his legal fees.  Mr. Paul, who is legally blind, faces  possible insolvency because of his in valuable efforts on behalf of Alaskan  Natives.  The bill  I  am  introducing  today  would correct this injustice by reliev ing Mr. and Mrs. Paul of this unwar ranted tax liability. I urge the prompt  and  favorable  consideration  o.f  this  measure.e  By Mr. THURMOND (for him self and Mr. HOLLINGS):  S. 2794.

215,House,98,-0.374,114,14,Mr. WOLPE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise this  afternoon to join in the expression of  concern about yesterday's jump in the  prime  interest rate, the fourth such  increase in the last 4 months.  It should now be crystal clear to ev eryone that yesterday's jump in the  prime rate  is a direct result of  the  clash between the credit demand to fi.  nance  the  recovery  and  the  credit  demand to finance the soaring Federal  budget deficit. It is absolutely impera tive  that we  take steps now to halt  this  competition  for  credit  before  rising interest rates halt the recovery.  The best way to dampen demand for  credit is to reduce these massive Fed eral deficits that are putting upward  pressure on  the  interest  rates. The  failure  to  reduce  these deficits and  hold down interest rates will have par ticularly severe impact on the interest sensitive sectors of our economy.  will become even more difficult  for  young  families  to buy  their homes.  Many Americans will be simply unable  to afford the financing costs to buy a  new car.  It is time to stop talking about inter est rates and actually do something  about them. It is  time to get serious  about reducing the huge Federal defi cits.

216,House,98,-0.436,114,14,Mr. LEVINE of California.," Mr.  Speaker, bigotry should have no place  in America. Yet the purveyors of hate  do not let up.  Louis Farrakhan yesterday  labeled  Israel's existence an ""outlaw act,"" he  labeled America and England ""crimi nal"" states, and he labeled Judaism a  ""gutter religion.""  Mr. Speaker, it is important to un derstand that these are not examples  of a black-Jewish rift. These are the  statements of an individual bigot.  Both blacks and Jews have long his tories  experiencing  suffering,  preju dice,  and bigotry and have worked  closely with each other and will con-  tinue to do so, fighting against preju dice and for civil rights.  Let us remember that Mr. Farrak han has a following of no more than  5,000  to 10,000 people  in  the entire  Nation; 95 percent of all black Ameri cans who are Muslims have chosen not  to follow his direction.  Especially for those of us whose po litical vision was shaped by the civil  rights movement and the inspiration  of prophets such as Martin Luther  King, Jr., let us remember that Mr.  Farrakhan's ugly and misguided com ments have been rejected both by the  minority community and the general  community, and that is as it should be.  D 1240  REAGAN  POLICIES  SEEN  AS  DEEPENING  UNITED  STATES  MILITARY  INVOLVEMENT  IN  CENTRAL AMERICA  <Mr. ALEXANDER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute, and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1984
217,House,98,-0.41,114,14,Mr. ALEXANDER.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday I released the findings of a 6month investigation conducted by the  General Accounting  Office,  which  report spells out the extent to which  Mr. Reagan has used his recent ""train ing"" exercises in Honduras as an ille gal cover for the deepening American  military involvement in Central Amer ica.  Secretary Weinberger responded to  that report by stating that the GAO  findings were ""bookkeeping errors.""  Mr.  Speaker,  the  decision  states  clearly that a majority of the military  construction undertaken during  the  ""training exercises,"" all training pro vided to Honduran troops by United  States military, and all civic and hu manitarian  actions  conducted  by  United States military personnel vio lates American law.  The Secretary of Defense, though, is  partially correct. The GAO investiga tion does point to serious errors, but  they are not bookkeeping errors.  Mr. Speaker, they are errors in the  President's policy in Central America,  a policy which is leading this Nation  into a deepening, widening military in volvement which  the President  of  Mexico says could lead us into a re gional war.

218,House,98,0.371,127,14,Mr. THOMAS of California.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, many people believe  that  the most  fundamental  right  which we possess in a democracy, the  right  to choose our  leaders by  free  election, is being unduly influenced by  the broadcast news media and  the  poll takers.  The Committee on House Adminis tration Task Force on Elections is of fering House Concurrent Resolution  321 out of concern that early projec tions of election results by broadcast  networks have an impact on the out come of the elections themselves. The  committee  is also greatly concerned  about the impact which early election  projections have on individual voters  across the Nation. We know from field  hearings  on  this  issue  that many  angry and disillusioned voters did not  cast ballots  in the 1980 Presidential  election after learning that the winner  had already been proclaimed on na tionwide  television and radio. As my  colleague indicated earlier, some State  elections and a congressional race may  very well have hinged on voter apathy  created by the early prediction of vic tory by the news media.  The prevailing attitude described by  witnesses at the hearings was, ""Why  should we vote when our vote doesn't  count? Why bother if it's all over as  soon as TV decides who's going  to  win?""  The testimony received by the com mittee reveals that Americans hold in  deep respect their right to vote, and  they are rightly upset when the im portance and meaning of each individ ual's vote is robbed by reports of what  may happen as  though  it had hap pened. Resentment and apathy  trig gered in the 1980 election could spread  with the increasing use of sophisticat ed polling techniques and early elec tion  projections  by  the  broadcast  media. Unless we act to balance the  public's right to know against the in tegrity of the polling place, the Ameri can public may decide it would be just  as well to sit out future elections, and  our democracy will be seriously threat ened.  I know that observers of this debate  might hastily conclude  that  this  only a west coast problem, but that is  certainly not the case. Although the  impact of early projections is greatest  in the West, as my colleague has de scribed, we should remember that the  projection of  the 1980 Presidential  race came while the polls were open in  about half the States in the nation. In  1981, the Governor's race was project ed in New Jersey while polls were still  open. In 1982, a number of State races  were projected before the polls closed.  is  In this Presidential election year, we  have already witnessed a number of  network projections  in primary elec tions around the country. On March  13, Super Tuesday,  the  three major  networks projected results in Florida,  Alabama, and Massachusetts 1 hour  before  the  polls  closed.  In Rhode  Island,  the call was made 2 hours  before  the polls closed.  In the New  York primary on April 3, the networks  began projecting results at 6:30 p.m.,  2% hours before the polls closed at 9  p.m. In Pennsylvania, network projec tions came 1 hour before  the polls  closed. And in the Iowa caucuses held  February 20, NBC and CBS were pro jecting winners before the voting had  even started.  The committee has  received more  than 1,000  letters from voters  in 49  States expressing disappointment and  bitterness over projections of election  results being made before  the polls  close. Opposition  to  this practice  is  also beginning to be heard from broad cast  industry  members.  Richard  Salant, the former president of CBS  News who pioneered in developing pro jections based on tabulating selected  voter precincts, now says he doesn't  trust  these  early  projections. The  president of Group W Television, Law rence P. Fraiberg, told his colleagues  recently that he is deeply concerned  with the effect which TV coverage specifically, exit polls and projections  based on those polls-is having on the  national political process. The admin istration, in reply to a House subcom mittee  inquiry on  its position, has  stated its opposition to projection of  Federal  election  results  because  of  their adverse effect on voter turnout.  Prior to the New York Presidential  primary election last April,  I  joined  my  colleagues  on  the House Task  Force on Elections and the House Sub committee on Telecommunications in  requesting the broadcast networks to  refrain  voluntarily  from  projecting  election results before the polls closed.  One of the networks replied that its  practice  is not to project winners of  primary elections until after the polls  are closed, and that it would adhere to  that practice through the rest of the  primary elections and in the Novem ber general election.  The networks  have  responded  to  growing public concern over their in fluence on elections by changing their  projections to characterizations -of re sults, but  the characterizations con tain at least as much, if not more, in formation than the projections. The  network  reporters make  comments  such as: ""indications are"" that a candi date will win a ""decisive victory"" or  that a candidate is ""doing very well""  and ""may win by as wide a margin as  he did in New York.""  Such characterizations, while stop ping  short  of  outright  prediction,  ",1984
219,House,98,-0.478,179,14,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  I will not use all of my 5 minutes. I  just want to add to the words of my  distinguished colleague, the gentleman  from New York [Mr. WEISS], and say  that New York is going now above and  beyond the call of duty.  We are functioning under a consent  decree. We are ahead of the schedule  outlined in the consent decree. When  the two plants under construction are  finished, one in May 1986 and one in  May 1987. we will be in compliance.  There  are  242  cities  around  the  country that are substantially situated  as New York City is. They are not in  compliance with all of the EPA re quirements, but they, as we are, work ing on  it. For some obscure  reason  that I do not understand, New York  City was the only city that was select ed for this rather invidious treatment.  I know it was not meant to be invidi ous treatment, but on the face of it. it  is, and I would urge my colleagues, the  gentlemen  from New  Jersey  [Mr.  HowARD and Mr. RoE], who have been  friends  and colleagues of mine  for  many, many  years,  to  accept  the  amendment offered by  the gracious  gentlewoman from New York. I think  it would be the collegial thing to do.  New York is aimed right at compli ance in a matter of months. They are  headed toward compliance, and they  are  in  compliance with  the  court  order.  Mr. Chairman, I would urge that we  have collegial and friendly action from  our friends across the Hudson.  Mr. McGRATH. Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of  the amendment offered by the gentle woman from New York [Ms. FERRARO].  ",1984
220,House,98,-0.431,179,14,Mr. HOWARD.," Mr. Chairman,  I  move to strike the requisite number of  words, and I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman. this is a very impor tant amendment.  Members might ask, why is the Con gress about to pick on New York City?  There is no large city in this Nation  other  than New York City which  dumps any raw sewage into the waters  to be sent down somewhere else.  I  wonder if the 240 cities that are men tioned that have some raw sewage add  up  to  this amount all put together.  New York City dumps and have been  dumping 220 million gallons of raw  sewage a day into the Hudson River.  That  is  220 million gallons  a  day.  enough to fill a football field at the  Meadowlands arena to a height of 67  stories high, two-thirds the height of  the huge complex buildings at the foot  of New York. That is 12 square miles  to a depth 1 inch thick each day.  At this rate,  if New York City did  not want to treat but just kept its raw  sewage, it would cover the entire city,  all five boroughs, in 1 month. But that  does not happen. It is dumped into the  waters of the Hudson River. It flows  down on the seashore areas, and for so  many years people who  live  in New  Jersey and the New Jersey seashore  that depend upon clean beaches and  clean water have said that we must  accept this from New York City be cause New York City  is so big and  powerful and rich and important that  the other communities  just have  to  take second place.  I  think the time has come  to  just  assure that New York City meets its  commitments. What we did in this leg islation is this: We did not stop con struction. We will not stop construc tion if New York City means what it  says. It sets a date of March 15, 1986.  We had an earlier date, but in dis cussions with a member of our com mittee, the gentleman from New York  [Mr. MOLINARI], we set that date back  to March 15, 1986, saying that that  puts a cap and a limit on how much  New York City may discharge into the  river to come down into New Jersey  and Long Island shores.  Now, New York City is working on  its North River plant. Its North River  plant is due to be in operation, treat ing only primary raw sewage, by No vember 1985. Under our amendment,  we figure it on an average per month  basis of  the year.  starting prior  to  March 15, 1986, which gives them 7%  months of heavy discharge of  raw  sewage 4% months after  the plant  opens. When that plant opens, it will  treat 150 million gallons a day. So  they do not have that much leeway to  work on.  What about the fact of what would  take place  if something happens? If  there is a strike that delays the con struction of that plant,  if there are  heavy overflows due to rain. if light ning strikes the plant and there is a  delay, in the substitute amendment of fered by  the gentleman  from New  Jersey [Mr. RoE] and myself there is a  provision that grants the head of EPA  the right to extend the time limit for  compliance.  So  if New York City  means what  it says,  it will have no  trouble at all.  New York City says that as far as  dumping  raw  sewage,  they  are  6  months  ahead.  If we  look  at  the  papers. they are 49 years behind. We  have  been  complaining  about  this  since 1935, and it is about time consid eration is given to those downstream.  New York City dumps this raw sewage  and they do not have to worry; it im mediately leaves their area, and they  get clean water from communities up stream that are taking of their sewage.  Nobody  is picking on New York. I  love New York. The Committee on  Public Works  and  Transportation  loves New York. There is no commit tee in this Congress that has been a  better friend of New York City down  through the years than our commit tee.  They have a problem with Newtown  Creek  in Brooklyn  that would cost  New York City $250 million to get into  secondary  treatment at  the proper  time. What did our committee do? We  wanted  to help  them. We put that  project on a demonstration basis, and  instead of having the Federal Govern ment only pay 55 percent, we grandfa thered in the old 75 percent. We do  not hear very much thanks from New  York City on that effort that is being  made this week in this Congress.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore.

As the gentleman knows,  section  515(b)(l)  of  the  Surface  Mining Control and Reclamation Act  of 1977 requires that a coal operator  maximize coal  recovery  so  that  the  land would not have to be reaffected  in the future.

In my State of Pennsylvania,  the  regulatory  authority  estimates  that  $75 million  in  reclamation per year  will be done by the private sector as a  result of this amendment.  So it is my understanding that under  this provision programs such as  the  one proposed by Pennsylvania's Gen eral  Assembly-which,  incidentally,  has  the  support  of both  the  coal  mining industry and the environmen tal community-would be an accepta ble program.

224,House,98,-0.332,192,14,Mr. NOWAK.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  I wish  to associate  myself with the remarks of my col league from West Virginia regarding  the importance of funding for the con struction of collector pipeline systems.  I must strongly disagree with those  who assert that the sole effect of col lector  construction  is  to  encourage  ""urban sprawl""  in  rural areas. The  simple  fact  is  this:  effective  wastewater  treatment  facilities  are  systems. Each part of these systems  must operate efficiently if the facili ties are  to properly  treat municipal  and industrial wastewater. The most  efficient and modern wastewater treat ment plant in the world is of little use  if there are not adequate pipelines to  collect the sewage and convey it to the  plant. Collector pipelines contribute to  economic expansion, not urban sprawl.  I  am  sure  that everyone  is  very  much aware of the national attention  that is being focused on America's de caying  infrastructure.  Recognizing  that the aging sewer systems are a  major problem facing our older indus trial cities of  the Northeast,  I have  been concerned that the 1981 amend ments to the Clean Water Act would  restrict Federal assistance for certain  categories of wastewater treatment fa cilities. Under current law, such cate gories  as  combined  sewer  overflow  [CSOJ projects and collector sewers  will not be eligible  for  full  funding  after October 1, 1984. However,  the  law does provide that each Governor  would be able to use 20 percent of his  annual allotment to fund such ineligi ble categories of construction.  I am pleased that the bill before us  today does reinstate CSO projects as  an eligible category for grant assist ance and also provides that collector  ",1984

I rise as one who is very sensitive to  what an important position this is; one  who by his statements and votes for  many years in this body has demon strated  his  prolife  position. But  I  oppose this amendment because it is  far too significant in its apparent pur pose to be adopted as a floor amend ment when we do not have an oppor tunity to assess what the full legal im plications are.  It was  not until  today, my  col leagues,  that  I  learned  this amend ment was going to be offered. I had  been assured earlier that the prolife  sector in our society was not in favor  of an amendment. This stemmed from  the fact  that  the negotiations were  carried on by the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on  the Judiciary  that should be standing where I am  today, our COlleague JIM SENSENBREN NER. And after negotiating with  the  prolife and prochoice forces, language  was agreed to by both which appears  on page 36 in the committee report to  make it absolutely clear that this bill  is neutral on this issue.  The language states:  This bill is not intended to convey either  the approval or disapproval of Congress  concerning the validity or appropriateness  of regulations issued under title IX concern ing health care  insurance and/or services  for employees and students with regard to  abortion.  We sincerely thought that this issue  had been put to rest. Our colleague,  the  gentleman  from  Wisconsin  thought so, too. It was not overnight  that he achieved this negotiated set tlement that apparently was agreed to  by both sides.  So,  I  submit  that  this  is not an  amendment brought  to us with  the  agreement of the prolife forces.  ",1984

234,House,98,0.16,244,14,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr.  Chairman, I move to strike the requi site number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup port of the Siljander amendment and I  would like to commend my friend from  Michigan for his courage and compas sion in offering this important amend ment.  I know, Mr. Chairman, that many  Members of  this body are growing  weary of abortion floor fights. But I  would suggest that what we do here  today may indeed result in some now  nameless,  voiceless  child-perhaps  many children-being given a chance  to live.  That, in and of itself, makes any in convenience wholly worthwhile.  I know the prochoice lobby here on  the Hill gets mightly uncomfortable  when faced with the horror of abor tion, or with  the humanity of  the  child in the womb, or with the increas ingly apparent fact that abortion ex ploits  women.  But  reality  isn't  changed or altered one  iota because  someone wishes it away or refuses to  face it. I am reminded of an editorial  that appeared in the Journal of the  California State Medical Association  in September 1970  that  eloquently  summed up this wishful thinking proc ess:  The reverence of each and every human  life has been a keystone of western medi cine, and is the ethic which has caused phy sicians  to  try  to preserve, protect, repair,  prolong, and enhance every human life.  Since the old ethic has not yet been fully  displaced, it has been necessary to separate  the idea of abortion from the idea of killing  which continues  to be socially abhorrent.  The result has been a curious avoidance of  the scientific  fact, which everyone  really  knows,  that human life begins at concep tion, and is continuous, whether intraor  extra-uterine, until death. The very consid erable semantic gymnastics which are  re quired to rationalize abortion as anything  but taking a human life would be ludicrous  if they were not often put forth under so cially  impeccable auspices. It is suggested  that this schizophrenic sort of subterfuge is  necessary because, while  a new ethic  is  being accepted, the old one has not yet been  rejected.  Mr. Chairman, there is no question  that the unborn child is human and  alive, and is the victim of pernicious  ",1984
235,House,98,0.541,257,14,Mr. FIELDS.," Mr.  Speaker, H.R.  5490, the Civil Rights Act of 1984 may  prove to be the most far-reaching ex pansion of Federal authority in this  decade. This  legislation has a most  worthy goal-to ensure that no Feder al funds are expended in a discrimina tory manner. I join the supporters of  H.R. 5490  in strongly opposing dis crimination. I find discrimination both  morally and ethically repugnant. How ever, I  feel compelled to oppose the  Civil Rights Act of 1984. The following  explanation is a clarification of my po sition.  H.R. 5490 seeks to overturn a recent  Supreme Court decision, Grove City  College against Bell. Grove City Col lege, a private, coed liberal arts school,  refused to file a Government compli ance form for title IX of the education  amendments, which prohibits discrimi nation on the basis of sex, claiming  that they receive no direct Federal aid  and, hence, are not required to prove  compliance. Grove City College was  never charged with discrimination, but  only with refusal to submit to Federal  regulations  and  their corresponding  administrative  paperwork. The  case  reached the Supreme Court. In ruling,  the Court held that: First, Federal fi nancial assistance to students did con stitute aid to the college, but, second,  only the specific program or activity  receiving Federal assistance would be  required to comply with Federal regu lations under title IX of the education  amendments of 1972.  H.R.  5490 was  introduced  in  the  House  to  overturn  the  Supreme  Court's second holding of limited cov erage. According to the bill's sponsors,  H.R. 5490  reinstates  institution-wide  coverage  of  antidiscrimination  stat utes; if any part of an institution re ceives Federal  assistance,  all  parts  must  comply. While  the  author's  intent may have been simply to return  to the status quo of institution-wide  coverage practiced prior to the Grove  City decision, the actual language of  the bill tells a different story.  H.R. 5490 amends four separate stat utes: The Education Amendments of  1972, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the  Age Discrimination Act of 1975 and  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The  two most fundamental changes made  in the above statutes are: The words  ""program and activity"" are deleted ev erywhere and replaced with the word  ""recipient,""  and,  subsequently,  the  word ""recipient"" is defined.  My concern centers upon the broad,  ambiguous  definition  of  recipient.  Under this bill, recipient means, not  only  the direct  recipient of Federal  aid, but also any subunit of an entity,  any ""successor, assignee, or transferee  to which Federal financial assistance  is extended-directly or  through an other entity or a person-or which re ceives support from the extension of  Federal financial assistance to any of  its subunits."" Think about it! It is dif ficult to isolate any public or private  entity or person which does not  in  some way, directly or indirectly, bene fit from Federal largess. According to  Assistant Attorney General William  Bradford Reynolds, the legislation re writes  the four  involved statutes  to  the point that""*     the Federal Gov ernment would be  involved  in every  facet of State and local activity.""  Again,  the sponsors of H.R. 5490  assure Congress and the U.S. public  that such broad coverage is not their  intent. But I, for one, am not willing  to rely solely on the stated intent of  the bill's sponsors. Plainly put, I feel  Congress should ""say what it means  and mean what it says""  in the bill,  itself.  During House consideration of the  Civil Rights Act of 1984, many ques tions surfaced regarding the scope of  the bill. For  instance: Will grocery  stores which accept food stamps now  be subject to Federal scrutiny? Federal  architectural standards requiring ex pensive structural changes to provide  access for the handicapped might well  be a financial death blow to small gro cers. If a local fire department accepts  Federal assistance, will the entire city  government be covered? The multiple  compliance  reviews  and massive  re porting requirements necessary merely  to certify compliance with Federal reg ulations would place a tremendous fi nancial burden on already financially  strapped local governments. And, what  about local hospitals which indirectly  benefit from medicaid and medicare?  The Federal Government has already  tried to get New York City to reassign  its teachers in violation of union con tracts to achieve racial balance in the  teaching staff of each school. Under  H.R. 5490, a city could be required to  reassign its hospital staff to achieve  racial balance.  Would a business housed in a facility  financed  through  the  use  of  tax exempt bonds be covered by this pro posal? In the case Consolidated Rail  Corp. against Darrone, a handicapped  individual sued a  railroad which  re fused to employ him. Darrone claimed  that since the railroad received Feder al funds, he couldn't be denied a  job  on the basis of his handicap. Presum ably, the indirect aid of being housed  in  a  facility built with  tax-exempt  bonds could force a business to hire a  handicapped individual even if his or  her handicap might require the pur chase of expensive, special equipment  to accommodate the disability or even  if  the  job might present a  risk  to  handicapped applicant's safety.  One of the most major questions in  my mind involves whether the intent  or the effects standard will be used to  determine violations under  this act.  Must an entity be found guilty of in tentional discrimination, or might an  entity be found in violation of Federal  law merely because a policy or practice  has an unintentional disproportionate  impact?

237,,98,-0.37,374,14,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to share with my colleagues  a wonderful article, written by Carl W.  Struever, that appeared in the Balti more Evening Sun. Mr. Struever, a  Baltimore  building  and  renovation  contractor, offers  fresh  insight  into  the idea of self-help. His concept of  bringing concerned citizens  together  with Government resources to provide  housing for the poor is truly inspiring  and resourceful. It is not surprising  that Mr. Struever  is  an  innovative  leader  in  redevelopment within  the  city  of Baltimore. Hopefully, with  people  like Mr. Struever working  to  provide housing for the poor, commu nities will really be able to help them selves.  The article follows:  SELF-HELP RENOVATORS ARE EFFICIENT, BUT  THEY STILL NEED u.s. CASH  <By Carl W. Struever)  Efficiency in getting the job done does not  beget efficiency in raising the money to pay  for getting the job done. This conflict is a  much neglected shortcoming of one of the  President Reagan's favorite themes: taking  the provision of social services out of the  hands of the federal government and giving  the control to the folks back at home.  For Reagan, step one is giving federal re sponsibilities  to  state  and  local  govern ments. Step two is getting all levels of gov ernment out of the picture entirely, andre sponsibility  into  the hand of  the private  sector. Step three, the ultimate in the deliv ery of social service, is self help-non profit  organizations  and  the  poor  themselves  banding together in a new energy of self  sufficiency.    Given a specific  job-trash collection or  housing construction for example-the local  folks can  in many  instances do a better,  more efficient job <imagine the federal gov ernment in the trash business). Direct ac countability and clear lines of authority can  bring  improved action. Unfortunately  the  flip side of the local folks getting the job  done efficiently  is a corresponding  ineffi ciency in raising the money to pay for the  service.  The farther from the federal government  the more difficult the fundraising job gets.  Thus, states can collect resources <tax> more  easily then cities. Since the private sector  (business> must rely on voluntary contribu tions,  the collection job grows  immensely.  Then the self-help folks have the roughest  time of all because not only must they rely  on voluntary support, but they don't have  much cash themselves to ""volunteer.""  To  illustrate the problems,  let's look at  our  society's  responsibility  of  providing  decent shelter for the poor. Here's a clearly  established track record demonstrating that  local folks can create housing at a far lower  cost than Washington.  For the Feds, low-income housing carries  a high price tag-as expensive as $100,000  for a Section 8 unit, if you add up front-end  production subsidies and ongoing rent subsi dies. States tend to stick to the financing of  housing and stay away from direct develop ment and operating responsibilities. Local ities like Baltimore have become adept at  adapting these state and federal programs  to the capabilities of local builders and the  condition of the city's housing stock. But  even Baltimore's sophistication in housing  development hasn't translated into cost effi ciency: An average ""dollar house"" costs the  homesteader $60,000 to renovate and a city sponsored rehab runs about $50,000.  As the President loves to point out, freed  from federal, state, and local government  participation, a private builder can achieve  substantial economies  from  the  increased  flexibility. However,  the big savings come  from the efforts of small non-profit neigh borhood groups that energize the poor to  help themselves. By getting housing spon sorship away from government and into the  community itself, expectations are dramati cally  transformed;  instead of sitting back  and expecting a rose garden the poor learn  to work hard for modest, decent housing. As  necessity is the mother of invention, scarc.e  cash drives community groups to creat inno vative methods and materials to cut costs,  making effect use of volunteer  labor and  sweat equity.  Anyone doubting  the efficiency of non profits should watch the inspiring self-help  action of the Concerned Citizens for North  Camden. In a community decimated by pov erty and housing abandonment, a  ragtag  group  of  residents  banded  together  to  attack  the  spread of vacant, boarded-up  houses. To protect a house from further  vandalism a homesteader family will move  in without heat or running water. Using a  $1,500  Community  Development  Block  Grant to help pay for wiring and plumbing,  the homesteader will scrimp and save, using  second-hand  and  scavenged materials. A  network of unemployed construction work ers will trade and barter for services, while  the homesteader himself works alongside  doing whatever he can himself. The end  result:  110  vacant hulks  renovated  into  decent liveable houses at an average cost of  $3,000.  On a larger scale in New York City, the  Urban Homesteaders Assistance Board has  helped 10,000 families renovate 375 apart ment buildings in the worst parts of Harlem  and the South Bronx at an average cost of  $2,000 per unit under the Tenant Interim  Lease Program. Faced with accelerating de terioration of building services and decrepit  and failing mechanical systems, the tenants  organize themselves, take over management  from the New York City, collect their own  rents and pay their own bills. With all rents  going directly into building improvements,  rent collections jump from an average of 30  percent with the city as landlord to at times  better than 100 percent as tenant enthusi asm takes hold. Tenants patrol the lobby to  keep out the crooks and recruit friends to  rent vacant apartments as soon as they are  renovated.  The  tragedy  is  the pitiful shortage of  funds  that  frustrates  all  this  positive  energy. The Concerned Citizens in Camden  lost their funding to federal budget cuts and  in New York lack of rehab funds has slowed  the Tenant Interim Lease Program  to a  standstill. This is where the efficiency of  the local folks gives way to inefficiency in  fundraising.  Locked in a fierce competition to attract  business, the state legislatures are reluctant  to  raise  taxes  to pay  for extra services.  Mayors are in even worse shape. With huge  numbers of poor families needing help and  ",1984
238,,98,-0.496,387,14,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr.  Speaker,  today I am introducing legislation to  provide  tax credits for the purchase  and installation of equipment to tap  low-temperature  geothermal  energy.  The bill would also excuse any tax or  interest due from those taxpayers who  during the last several years mistaken ly took the geothermal tax credit for  low-temperature  geothermal  equip ment based on erroneous advice from  the IRS.  In  1978,  Congress  enacted  the  Energy Tax Act, which included a tax  credit for the purchase of geothermal  energy equipment. That legislation did  not include any wellhead-temperature threshold  requirement  for  the  tax  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  credit. However,  in  1980,  the  IRS  issued regulations prohibiting the use  of the credit for equipment drawing  on geothermal deposits below 50 c  < 122 F). Geothermal deposits of this  temperature are only found in a very  few areas of the Far West. While Con gress enacted the tax credit to encour age the nationwide use of renewable  energy sources,  the  IRS  regulations  limit the use of the credit to a very  small area of the country.  To make matters worse,  IRS field  agents seemed unaware of their own  regulations and advised taxpayers for  several  years  that  low-temperature  geothermal  equipment qualified  for  the credit. Now IRS is demanding that  these taxpayers repay the credit plus  interest. I am told that some taxpay ers in my area called IRS in February  of this year and were informed incor rectly  that low-temperature geother mal-energy  equipment  qualified  for  the credit. Some of my constituents  are now being forced to pay as much  as $4,000 in tax deficiencies plus inter est because  they relied on  incorrect  advice from IRS agents.  I think that the IRS regulations are  contrary  to  the  intent of Congress  when we enacted the Energy Tax Act  of 1978. Congress intended that tax payers around the country should be  able to take advantage of the geother mal and other renewable energy tax  credits. In addition,  it  is outrageous  for IRS agents to be giving incorrect  advice 4 years after the Service issued  its regulations on this matter.  My bill would remove this arbitrary  and unwarranted temperature thresh old established by IRS. Thus, ground  water  heat  pumps, which  extract  energy  from  shallow  underground  streams to heat buildings, would be eli gible for the credit. The bill would also  excuse those who incorrectly took the  tax credit for these devices after rely ing on advice from the IRS.  Ground water is particularly plenti ful in the Northeast and Midwest, and  can be found in streams 50 to 200 feet  below the Earth's surface. It ranges in  temperature from about 77 F in Flori da to 40 F at the Canadian border.  The  temperature  remains  constant  thoughout the year.  Ground water heat pump systems  are considered to be 3 to 5 times as ef ficient as fossil-fuel heating systems in  terms  of heat output per unit of  energy put in. By one estimate, ground  water has the capacity to replace fossil  fuel heating and electrical cooling in  85 percent of the domestic dwellings in  the Northeast-Midwest  region alone.  Surely, this is the very kind of energy conserving system  the 1978 act was  aimed at encouraging.  A number of States have already en acted their own energy tax credit for  gound water heat pump systems.  I  urge my colleagues to carefully consid er this important piece of legislation.e  19009  INTER-AMERICAN FOUNDATION  HON. ROBERT GARCIA  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 26, 1984   ",1984
239,,98,-0.559,387,14,Mr. GARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, I have  been an ardent supporter of the Inter American Foundation for the past few  years. Unfortunately,  the  leadership  of that nonpolitical organization has  become  highly  politicized  over  the  past year. What most disturbs me  about this turn of events is that it was  entirely  unnecessary.  The  Founda tion's work,  its past president, Mr.  Peter Bell, and its capable staff were  too busy trying to live up to the Foun dation's mandate to become involved  in politics.  I am submitting an article by Scott  Olesen on the Foundation for my col league's perusal. It will,  I  trust, give  them an important update on the cur rent status of the IAF:  THE  INTER-AMERICAN  FOUNDATION: GOLDEN  DoOR  CLOSING  ON  LATIN  AMERICA-A  COUNCIL ON HEMISPHERIC AFFAIRS  <By Scott Olesen)  On June 15, the Reagan-stacked Board of  Directors of  the  Inter-American Founda tion-a 14-year-old non-partisan government  development  agency  that works  directly  with  grass-roots  organizations  in  Latin  America-nominated  Deborah  Szekely,  founder and director of Golden Door spas in  California, as  the new Foundation presi dent.  The nomination follows a three-year war  waged by the Reagan administration to gain  control  over  the  ostensibly  apolitical  agency, and if carried through would effec tively  squash  the  independence  of  the  United States' most successful development  group.  Szekely  is not yet president. The 4-2  Board vote  in her favor started a 30-day  period in which the Board is  to come up  with a solution satisfying all of its members.  At the end of this period the Board will re convene and cast a final vote under majority  rule, although IAF-watchers do not antici pate that the Board will reach a compro mise on the naming of Szekely.  If the vote remains the same, the Board  will break a non-binding pledge made  to  members of Congress that the presidential  choice would be  reached unanimously, as  had been done on all previous occasions. It  also would violate past Board minutes re quiring unanimous consent.  The ouster last Dec. 5 of the highly re garded Peter Bell necessitated the search  for a new president. Rep. Dante Fascell <D Fla.), chairman of the House Foreign Af fairs Committee, charged that the ouster  was ""the culmination of a three-year effort  by the administration to recast the IAF in  its own ideological mold."" Fascell was the  presiding figure behind the IAF's founding.  Latin American leaders, development orga nizations and members of Congress-includ ing moderate Republicans and Rep. Robert  Garcia <D-NY)-angrily criticized the move,  and three members of the Foundation's ad visory council resigned in protest.

241,House,98,-0.631,413,14,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I  intend  to support this conference report, and  I want to thank the committee chair man, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr.  RosTENKOWSKI], the staff on the ma jority and minority side,  the distin guished ranking minority member, the  gentleman from New York [Mr. CoN~  ABLE], for their work.  There are several significant tax re forms  in  this bill,  and  I would be  remiss in not thanking and calling at tention to the outstanding work done  by my colleague on the minority side,  the gentleman  from Louisiana  [Mr.  MooRE],  on what  is  known  as  the  Stark-Moore  insurance bill.  I would  also like to thank the gentleman from  New York [Mr. CONABLE] for his out standing patience and work on  the  fringe benefit section of this bill which  satisfies  a  longstanding  legislative  need.  The bill goes a long way in a biparti san step toward reducing the deficit  and toward making some tax reform,  but  there  is  some bipartisan blame  that we are all going to have to share.  There are a  lot of American people,  the elderly and middle-class people,  who are going to pay a lot in this bill.  They are going to pay $7 billion more  one way or another in Medicare and  medicaid. It is interesting to note that  with one sweep of the pen early Satur day morning, we gave $12 billion to  the major corporations in this country  tax free, as a gift. It was never asked  for. They were willing to pay about $4  billion of that in taxes without even  fighting.  0 1310  So on the one hand we gave, and let  us say that $1 billion of that went to  General Electric; 28 million people in  this country are going to have $8 or $9  billion  in cuts  in benefits while we  gave billions away to General Electric,  TRW, Allied Chemical, Exxon, and  the like.  We cut $35 million out of the poor  people in California for a fine they did  not deserve. At the same time we gave  Boeing Aircraft $35 million  for one  plane that had already been sold at a  profit. We gave Boeing $35 million and  we were arguing whether we would  give  them seven, or eight, or nine  extra planes at $35 million a tax credit  apiece. In the end Boeing got $630 mil lion as a gift and the American public  get to pay for it.  We are caving in today to the ""Real tors"" who are complaining about going  from 15  to 18 years of depreciation.  The real estate industry, in fact, pays  no income tax at all. In 1982, the net  income from real estate in this coun try was a negative $8 billion. Had we  made real estate income tax free, we  would have had $4 billion a year in  revenue to add to deficit reduction.  It is interesting to note that not one  of you on the Republican side or on  the Democratic side came to me and  said, ""I need some help for the people  in my district,"" yet literally hundreds  of you came to me and said, ""I have a  corporation or a rich family that needs  a little loophole in this bill."" We sure  took care of them; but I am not sure  we did anything to be proud of in our  job of taking care of the middle class  or the poor.  This is not a deficit-reduction bill. It  is a dignity-destruction bill.  I want to warn Boeing and General  Electric, which made $2% billion and  got a $500 million refund not so long  ago,  I  do not  think  the American  public, which  is  footing  the bill,  is  going to put up with this type of re verse Robin Hood for very long.

243,House,98,0.103,426,14,Mr. BOEHLERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of adoption of the confer ence report.  Mr. Speaker, I can think of a dozen  excuses, especially during this political  season, for Members to use in running  from this legislation.  But  there's one  overriding  valid  reason for mustering our courage to  support it: we must-we must-demon strate to the American people our de termination to get our Federal fiscal  house in order.  This measure, by itself, won't even  come close to doing the complete job.  However,  it's a  long overdue step in  the right direction.  It's mind boggling to think in terms  of a national debt in the $1% trillion  range. That's what we've got. And it's  almost  sinful  to  think  about  our  present  situation  in which we  are  spending more each year just for the  annual interest on our national debt  than we are for all of our federally  aided job training and education pro grains combined. Talk about priorities  being out of whack.  On top of all this, we have projected  deficits-absent any definitive action  on our part to the contrary-that will  find us at the end of this decade with  a national debt approaching $2% tril lion.  Clearly, something has to be done to  reverse this trend. It used to be that  talk of deficits, prime interest rates,  the national debt and other supposed ly esoteric subjects like the interrela tionship  between  fiscal  policy  and  monetary policy was heard only on  Wall Street or in oak paneled board  rooins. No more.  Now,  and  I have  the evidence  to  prove  it,  these subjects are also dis cussed on Main Street as well as Wall  Street.  Invariably, one of the first questions  asked at one of my frequent citizen  forums-others might call them town  meetings-same thing-back home  in  the  real world goes  something  like  this: ""When are you people in Wash ington going  to do something about  this fiscal mess we're in?""  Today we have an opportunity  to  provide an answer to that most serious  and very meaningful question.  And, we have an opportunity, by  casting what can legitimately be de scribed as a ""tough"" vote,  to send a  clear signal to all who are concerned  and are watching, not just back home,  but in the community beyond, here  and aboard, that we intend to back up  our words with deeds  in coming  to  grips with the aptly described ""fiscal  mess.""  The measure before us  is but one  piece of the overall puzzle that we are  attempting to put together, one that  involves an overall-House version-3year $182 billion deficit reduction pro gram.  It  is an  integral part of  the  whole.  Through a combination of spending  cuts ana revenue raisers, we have a  change to make a $60 billion-plus con tribution to the kitty.  We're doing it, I think, in the proper  and prudent way. Perhaps a better  way  to approach  it is by describing  what we're not doing. We're not rais ing individual tax rates. That's good.  We're not abandoning income tax in dexing, a system under which the big  gainer from  inflation  is Government  and  the big  loser  is  the  taxpayer.  Maintaining our commitment  to  in dexing is also good. What we are doing  is  implementing reforms  to our Tax  Code and closing many of the loop holes which are being taken advantage  of by only the most advantaged in our  society. No need to recount them all,  they have been more than adequately  addressed during this debate.  Another  important aspect of what  we are about falls under the heading  of what I refer to as the ""spreading  the pain"" concept. No one segment of  our society is singled out for particu larly harsh treatment, yet many seg ments are being asked to give a little.  That's reasonable. That's fair.  The conferees haven't come up with  a perfect plan. Far from it. There are  a  number  of  provisions,  taken  by  themselves, which probably could not  and would not survive an up or down  vote. They, too, have been thoroughly  discussed here this afternoon. I've got  my pet peeves with the overall meas ure, but upon sober reflection, I'm re sisting the temptation to dwell on the  individual parts rather than concen trate on the overall package. I guess  that's called realism. Or perhaps prag matism.  We need to be realistic and pragmat ic as we get on with the job that needs  to be done. And this is just the begin ning. Before concluding, Mr. Speaker,  I think it very much in order to pay  tribute to the leadership of the com mittee which painstakingly fashioned  this compromise measure.

244,House,98,-0.298,439,14,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr. Speaker, I  reluctantly  support  the  conference  report on H.R. 4170,  the Deficit Re duction Act of 1984.  A little over 2 months ago, when the  House passed H.R. 4170 and sent it to  the Senate, I said on the floor that de cisive action was needed to reduce the  deficit. I noted at that time that the  prime interest rate had just risen from  11.5 percent to 12 percent.  There  is no doubt  that  the huge  deficits projected  in  the President's  budget are creating tremendous con cern  in  the  financial markets. The  public  is  justifiably  skeptical about  our resolve in dealing with this prob lem. Just last week the prime rate rose  agian, this time from 12.5 to 13 per cent. It's clear that the Congress has  to do something to demonstrate a will ingness to get control of the budget.  The National Association of Home  Builders,  in a  letter I  received from  their president this week in support of  H.R. 4170, say:  The current $200 billion deficit is trigger ing expectations of inflation and pushing up  interest rates .... You must act or risk fur ther increases in interest rates, which would  lead to a housing recession and stifle the in vestment needed  for a  continuing strong  economy.  I agree with this assessment of the  interest  rate  picture,  and  for  this  reason, more than any other, support  this package which will at least make  a $63 billion cut in the projected defi cit over the next 4 years.  When H.R.  4170 was  before  the  House in April, I supported efforts at  ",1984

At various points during more than 8  years prior to my becoming a Member  of Congress, I provided legal services  in connection with a proposed redevel opment project in downtown Detroit,  MI.  This proposed project could be af fected by the provisions of H.R. 4170,  and therefore, I have voted ""present""  rather than in favor of the bill.

251,House,98,0.326,517,14,Mr. LIVINGSTON.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in support of H.R. 5898, the mili tary construction appropriations bill  for fiscal year 1985.  I want to com mend the chairman, Mr. HEFNER, and  the ranking minority member, RALPH  REGULA, for the leadership they exhib ited with regard to this bill. As always,  they have equitably addressed all of  the controversial issues, and have gra ciously responded to every Member's  concerns about certain military con struction projects.  Members  staff  and  subcommittee  staff are particularly to be commend ed for their hard work and coopera tion in dealing so successfully with our  concerns.  Mr. Chairman, this bill is worthy of  this Chamber's support  for  several  reasons, some of which Mr. HEFNER  and Mr. REGULA have already touched  on.  First, the savings in this bill from  the administration  request are sub stantial. Just over $2 billion from the  original $10.3 billion request was cut  by the committee ..  Nevertheless, the total recommenda tion for military construction is still  $1.1  billion over  the 1984  approved  amount. We have provided very impor tant increases in almost every military  construction category: Army milcon,  $422.2 million above 1984 levels; Navy  milcon,  $242.9 million  above  1984  levels; Air Force milcon, $132.2 million  above  1984  levels;  Reserve  Forces  milcon, $100 million above 1984 levels;  Army  family  housing,  $72 million  above 1984  levels; Navy /Corps hous ing, $35.7 million above 1984  levels;  and Air Force housing, $26.3 million  above 1984 levels.  Some of the key policy  issues ad dressed by this bill include increased  emphasis  on  European-NATO  con struction  programs,  Persian  Gulf Indian Ocean projects, and improve ment of the quality of life for our serv ice personnel.  One of the unnoticed but equally im portant issues addressed in this bill is  a requirement granting American pref erence for contractors in the Persian  Gulf-Indian Ocean sector and the Pa cific  territories,  including Kwajalein  and Johnston Islands.  In addition, for the first  time, the  Defense Department will have to ad vertise  in  the Commerce Business  Daily for all overseas and NATO con struction projects exceeding $5 mil lion. This mandate contained in the  committee report will increase Ameri can contractors' chances in competing  more effectively overseas.  Both Mr. HEFNER and Mr. REGULA  are  directly  responsible  for  the  progress the committee has made in  these areas, and their efforts should  not go unchallenged. However, there  are certain areas not addressed in this  bill which I hope will be connected in  conference.  Mr. Chairman, I urge Members of  this Chamber to support the 1985 mili tary construction appropriations bill.  ",1984
252,House,98,0.394,517,14,Mr. EDWARDS of Oklahoma.," I will  not take the 2 minutes. I just wanted  to say that this bill, which we have  worked on for quite some time, is in  fact, I think, despite what the gentle man from Minnesota said, a very good  attempt to work out a reasonable posi tion on a variety of issues with a lot of  pressures coming at us from a lot of  Members of this Congress, all of whom  have interests in their own districts. I  think the chairman of this subcommit tee, with whom  I have worked  for  some time, and the ranking member,  have done an outstanding job in trying  to put together a bill that addresses  not only  the needs of  this country  militarily and the needs of the various  congressional districts involved, but in  trying  to keep  it within  reasonable  limits.  We have fought very hard against  Pentagon requests which were unrea sonable. We  have  held  very  high  standards in terms of design, in terms  of trying to make sure that there was  no attempt by any member of  the  committee or subcommittee to put in  place things that could not be totally  justified. We have set things aside to  come back to them later.  I would urge all of my colleagues on  this side and that side both to support  this bill. It is a bill we can all be proud  of.  ",1984
253,Senate,98,0.257,660,14,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President,  I  say  to  the Senator from New York  that  I was not here  for his entire  speech with reference  to this deficit  reduction package. I have the greatest  respect for the Senator's analysis and  reasoning.  But let me say to him that to vote  against  this package because of the  notion that we do not have the caps  on appropriations seems undefensible.  I think if we had enough time here to night we could prove to him unequivo cally  that  the package and  the ar rangements made  publicly  between  the President and the Appropriations  Committee and on which the Appro priations  Committee  has  recently  acted publicly, are an assurance of the  caps  on  appropriated  accounts  for  1985. The Appropriations Committee  has adopted the same number-$139.8  billion-that was in the Senate-passed  cap but, I believe now has even a little  more strength.  The appropriators now have agreed  on how  that $139.8  billion will be  spread, what subcommittees it will be  going to and the sum total. They have  agreed not to exceed that figure and  for the first time we have the Presi dent's concurrence  in advance as  to  the allocation.  Frankly, I do not see how anyone,  knowing the way we do business, can  think that that is less than a substan tive  cap of  the  same number  that  would have to wait the passage of ap propriations bills, add  them up, see  what happened when  they were all  finished, and exercise a point of order  after they were all finished if they ex ceeded the amount.  So I think on that score it is an abso lute draw.  With reference to the other cap, de fense,  let me repeat: There are only  two numbers being discussed on defense  for  the  fiscal year 1985. The  number we voted on here, $299 billion  in budget authority, and a number the  House had put in their recommenda tions  of  $286  billion. The  cap we  talked about was the $299 billion. I ask  does anybody think that is going to be  exceeded when  the difference  is be tween that and $286 billion? Frankly, I  do not think that has anything what soever to do with how much is going to  be spent.  If you want  to  talk about other  things, you could. But the cap issue  really no longer makes any difference  in terms of the deficit. We could not  put 11  appropriation bills here  to night, add them up to $139.8 billion in  budget authority, and say we have a  cap.  I think you have the best assurance  we have ever had that you are not  going to exceed that. So there may be  other reasons  the Senator does not  like the package. But certainly that is  not a valid one. I thank the Senator  for yielding.  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.  ",1984

256,,98,0.3,816,14,Mr. KEMP.," Mr.  Speaker, David  Brody, the Anti-Defamation League's  talented Washington  representative,  has truly ""arrived'': he has been pro filed in TASS. It is not often that the  propaganda arm of the Soviet Govern ment does an  indepth feature on a  prominent member of the B'nai B'rith.  But it seems that just as the Soviets  have become accustomed  to stealing  Western  technology, so  too do  they  steal news reports. If the TASS wire  service piece on Mr. Brody had a de cided New York flavor to it, that was  because it was a near verbatim transla tion of a New York Times article of a  year ago, with the noticeable addition  of  some original Soviet anti-Zionist  slurs.  ""Washington Talk"" columnists Wil liam  Farrell  and Warren Weaver  called attention to this Soviet imita tion in their article, ""Get Me TASS  Rewrite,"" which I ask be printed in  the RECORD. I also ask that the orginal  New York  Times  feature  on Mr.  Brody, ""An 'Unelected Member' of the  Senate,"" be included as well.  I will leave it to TASS to publish the  Soviet dispatch and in the meantime,  keep up the good work Dave.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  [From the New York Times, May 14, 19841  GET ME TASS REWRITE  <By William E. Farrell and Warren Weaver,  Jr.>  Soviet correspondents, it seems, can also  succumb to the age-old journalistic practice  of rewriting their competitors. In a January  copy of Sovetskaya Moldaviya, a Kishinev  daily, appears a Tass dispatch that bears a  striking resemblance to a profile of David  Brody, Washington lobbyist for  the Anti Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, that ran  on this page a year ago.  The Tass article begins as almost a trans lation of the New York Times article, dis cribing how Mr. Brody is accorded senatori al privileges  in riding the Capitol subway  and elevators. Then phrases that were not  in the original begin appearing; B'nai B'rith  is described as ""completely under the con trol of Zionist circles"" and Mr. Brody as op posing bills ""which do not correspond to the  interests of Tel Aviv 'hawks.'""  A quotation from Mr. Brody, explaining  his position on aid to Israel, is materially al tered. The Times version: ""You can't win  over the Arabs by weakening Israel. If Israel  receives the aid it needs, it's in a better posi tion  to  compromise;  a weakened  Israel  cannot."" The Tass version: ""You will not get  the good will of the Arabs by weakening  Israel. If Tel Aviv receives the assistance it  needs, then the U.S.A. will be in a better po sition.''  After about 400 words, the Russian writer  parts company with the original story alto gether to discuss the impact on Congress of  ""Zionist and pro-Israel organizations"" and  the current volume of United States aid to  Israel. He concludes, entirely on his own,  that ""all the doors and loopholes on Capitol  Hill are open for David Brody; which he  sees in his dreams crowned by the Zionist  symbol, the six-pointed Star of David.""  [From the New York Times, May 26, 19831  AN ""UNELECTED MEMBER"" OF THE SENATE  <By Martin Tolchin)  WASHINGTON, May 25.-""Senators Only""  said the sign in front of the Capitol subway,  but David Brody was waved aboard by Sena tor Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa,  whom he thanked for signing a resolution  opposing the sale of advanced weaponry to  Jordan.  ""Senators Only"" said the sign above the  elevators in the Capitol, but Mr. Brody was  escorted onto  the car by Senator  Jesse  Helms,  Republican  of North  Carolina,  whom he congratulated on North Carolina  State's N.C.A.A. basketball championship.  ""Dave Brody is the unelected member of  the U.S. Senate,"" said Senator Charles McC.  Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland, who  is an old friend.  Mr. Brody, who will be 67 years old next  month,  is a short, kinetic institution who  seems to know just about everyone in Gov ernment. He is the Washington representa tive  of  B'nai B'rith's Anti-Defamation  League, and, like those of many other lobby ists, his office walls are lined with signed  photographs of Presidents and other White  House notables. ""What would we do without  friends?"" wrote Vice President Bush, and  James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief  of staff, called Mr. Brody ""oftentimes a  strong ally, occasionally a worthy adversary,  but always a friend.''  It is  the Senate, however, where Mr.  Brody presses his campaigns, which focus  on aid to Israel and support of civil rights  legislation. Some other lobbyists for Jewish  June 27, 198.9  organizations consider him a loner because  of his  failure  to coordinate his activities  with  them, and some Capitol Hill people  regard him as overly persistent. But most  consider him effective.  STRATEGY ON AID TO ISRAEL  ""Dave Brody can get in and out of more  senators' offices quicker than any person I  have ever met in my life,"" said former Vice  President Walter F. Mondale.  Mr. Brody's present concerns include the  foreign aid authorizaton bill, which contains  an increase in aid to Israel, and legislation  that would put teeth into a fair housing bill.  On aid to Israel, Mr. Broder tells senators,  ""You can't win over the Arabs by weakening  Israel. If Israel receives the aid it needs, it's  in a better position to compromise; a weak ened Israel cannot.'' On the fair housing bill  be tells them, ""Without effective enforce ment, the bill doesn't mean very much.''  Mr. Brody is a full-service lobbyist. He in troduces senators to constituents, fund-rais ers,  reporters and  ""people  I  think  they  should meet.'' He gives personal advice. He  suggests positions on a wide range of sub jects, including those in which his organiza tion is disinterested.  ""I don't come around only when I need  something,"" Mr. Brody said.""! come around  to chat on a general exchange of views. I  don't  have  a  heavy-handed,  demanding  style.''  OF FRIENDS AND AWACS  ""He's given me valuable advice,"" said Sen ator Howell Heflin, an Alabama Democrat.  ""He has a broad range of interests.""  Mr. Brody doesn't seem to care if a sena tor is a Democrat or Republican, liberal or  conservative. Some of his closet friends  in  the Senate voted for the sale of Awacs to  the Saudis, which Mr. Brody lobbied hard,  and unsucessfully,  to defeat.  ""Somebody  can be against you on one issue, and with  you on the next,"" he said.  His manner can be direct. When Senator  Lloyd Bentsen,  the Texas Democrat,  told  him that Israel needed another Golda Meir,  Mr. Brody replied, ""Senator, if you have the  power to resurrect Golda Meir, that's fine  with me, but Golda Meir also had problems  with our government.  Mr. Brody does considerable entertaining  at home, often bringing senators together  with  the  Israeli Ambassador. Rolf Pauls,  former German Ambassador to Washington,  once quipped that he had seen more sena  tors at Mr. Brody's home  than on  the  Senate floor.  Mr. Brody, a native New Yorker who is a  graduate of City College and Columbia Law  School, came to Washington in 1940 to work  for  the Department of Agriculture,  and  joined the league in 1949. He was promoted  to chief Washington representative in 1965.  His style has evolved over  the decades.  ""Maybe I am a loner,"" he said. ""I have my  own style. You have to be able to relate to  people, even when you find yourself in dis agreement. You have to deal with members  as  individuals, and know what  their con cerns are. I'd have a very narrow range of  friends if we had to agree on every issue.''e  ",1984

Beautiful  waters, mild temperatures, and friend ly people create an environment aptly  called the land of pleasant living. One  of our greatest assets  is clearly  the  people who live on the Eastern Shore.  The land of pleasant living would not  be  so, were  it not  for people  like:  Lemuel H.  ""Bo"" Benton,  Thomas  Ewing,  Albert  Stant,  Bernard  F.  Dadds,  Elmer Kessler,  J. Thomas  Rhodes, and C. Harper Starkey. Re cently, Queen Annes County, MD, rec ognized these outstanding individuals  for their public service to the county.  It has been estimated that the sum  total  of  service  to Queen Annes  County  by  these  seven  individuals  totals 172 years.  Mr. Speaker,  I  proudly  represent  Queen Annes County here in the Con gress.  I  say  proudly  because  this  county publicly thanked these individ uals for this public service. I believe it  is noteworthy to include in the RECORD  today a copy of an editorial which ap peared in the Star Democrat on June  21,  1984.  It  apropriately  applauds  Queen Annes County and its board of  county  commissioners  for  honoring  these public servants.  IT WAs A NrcE WAY To SAY THANK You  Queen Anne's County did a nice thing last  week.  It honored, as  it does annually, a  handful of citizens for outstanding county  service.  There was Lemuel H. ""Bo"" Benton, the  former Queen Anne's County and Sudlers ville Town Commissioner, for instance, who  was cited  for his work on a number of  boards and commissions, including those re lated to criminal justice, recreation and the  elderly.  There was  Thomas Ewing,  owner  of  Holly's Restaurant, who worked with  the  county's election board  for 22 years and  with the Goodwill Fire Co. for 55 years.  There was Queenstown Bank President  Albert Stant, a life member of the Queens town Volunteer Fire Co., who served on the  county's Civil Service Board since its start  in 1967.  And there were four others-Bernard F.  Dadds,  a  volunteer  fireman and election  board member; Elmer Kessler, an election  19451  board member and former bicycle shop op erator; J. Thomas Rhodes, a mailman and  leader in education, 4-H and various good works  clubs;  and C. Harper Starkey,  a  former election official who was the coun ty's tax assessor for 13 years. One county  commissioner said  the seven had given a  total of 172 years service to the county.  What was nice about the awards is that it  was done so publicly and so formally by the  county commission. Of course there can be  all sorts of pitfalls in such events, not the  least of which  is  that  the  awards  can  become something of political price avail able  only  to  county office  holders  and  friends, colleagues and acquaintances of the  politicians who bestow them. Still, it seems  a wonderfully open way to honor those who  have given so much to their various commu nities.  Other counties-or perhaps a major civic  group-might want  to consider  following  the Queen Anne's lead and honoring their  own public servants. What better way to say  thanks?e  TRIBUTE TO TILLAMOOK  CREAMERY ASSOCIATION  HON. LES AuCOIN  OF OREGON  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 27, 1984   Mr. AuCOIN. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor one of Oregon's oldest  and finest businesses. The Tillamook  County Creamery Association, makers  and distributors of the world famous  Tillamook Cheese  is  currently cele brating their 75th year of operation.  Since its inception, the creamery has  been producing dairy products which  meet rigid in-house standards, subse quently marketing  this now  famous  product nationwide, and making Tilla mook Cheese a near household name.  Since 1894, when a young Canadian  named Peter Mcintosh arrived in Til lamook County, dairy  farmers have  banded  together  to produce a dairy  product that was superior to any other  cheese around. A gold medal at the St.  Louis Worlds Fair in 1904 was the first  of many awards that has helped make  Tillamook Cheese  such a  respected  product. For the past 75 years, with  the assistance of local dairy farmers,  the Tillamook County Creamery Asso ciation has continued to oversee the  cheesemaking process.  Over 100,000 gallons of fresh, whole  milk is received daily at the Tillamook  creamery from over 220  local dairies  which make up the unique cooperative  system  utilized  by  the  creamery.  These  dairymen who  provide  the  creamery with the milk products are  an independent group of hard work ing,  dedicated Oregonians. For  the  most part, these dairymen and women  do not take part in the milk diversion  program  and  operate  their  dairies  without Federal assistance.

258,,98,-0.465,842,14,Mr. WHEAT.," Mr. Speaker, the Na tion's oldest and largest civil rights or ganization,  the National Association  for  the Advancement  of  Colored  People, is celebrating its 75th year as a  champion in the struggle for freedom  and human rights of all Americans.  In 1909, when the organization was  founded, conditions of black Ameri cans were, at best, dismal and growing  worse by the day. A small, but emi nent, group of citizens from all over  the United States, black and white, re sponded to the call for an end to the  eventual demise and further oppres sion of black Americans and the begin ning of full citizenship rights. On the  centennial of the birth of Abraham  Lincoln,  these  concerned Americans  gathered in New York City to partici pate in a conference which led to the  organization of the NAACP.  Early  organization  aims were  to  create a truly democratic society, a so ciety  in which  racial  injustice wa.S  eliminated and equality of opportunity  was brought within reach. This would  be done peacefully by relying on the  available vehicles of  the press,  the  ballot, and the courts. Therefore the  blueprint for  the proposed organiza tion was designed to cover all areas of  injustice. The early organizers per ceived a  strong  legal department  to  carry  to  the courts case after case  until they were compelled to end sepa,.  rate laws for some, a publicity bureau  to  research  and  publicize  human  atrocities, a political bureau to ensure  representation, a civil rights bureau to  investigate alleged  injustices, and an  industrial bureau  to ""deal with  the  colored man in relation to labor"" and  jobs.  At a time when the Federal Govern ment and the courts offered no relief,  the NAACP had no small task before  it in 1909. In the face of overt and vio lent  racial hostility,  it conducted a  forceful crusade against lynching and  fought to end discrimination and seg regation  in  employment,  industry,  education, voter registration, election  laws,  the  armed  services,  housing,  transportation, accommodations, and  eating establishments.  Over the past 75 years, the NAACP  has  fought many hard  fights, won  major victories, suffered many disap pointments and undergone changes in  structure and leadership. But it sur vived and today remains at the fore front of the continuing 'fight for free dom, dignity,  and equality. Today's  struggle is as great as it was 75 years  ago. As it was then, it is now, not a  black struggle-but a human struggle.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  For as long as one man is in bondage,  so is all of mankind.  According  to  a  Census  Bureau  report, in the 1970's black Americans  suffered  sharp  setbacks  in  employ ment and in the social areas:  The disproportionate impact on blacks of  the economic downturn beginning in 1974  and  of  the  relatively  sluggish  economy  through 1983 effectively brought to a halt  the momentum of overall social and eco nomic improvement apparent of the begin ning of this decade.  Dr. Benjamin Hooks, the executive  director of the NAACP,  in a  recent  statement warned  that we  are  in  danger of losing some rights we have  won if we do not do something about  the high unemployment now sustained  by black Americans.  I join my fellow Americans in a trib ute of  thanks and applause  to  the  NAACP on the occasion of their dia mond jubilee celebration. The status  of black Americans has advanced sig nificantly, and the NAACP can take  pride in its role in achieving that suc cess. But the struggle continues.e  TRIBUTE TO MAJ. GEN. HARRY  W.

259,,98,-0.465,842,14,Mr. SHANNON.," Mr. Speaker,  the  principal  challenge  confronting hu manity today is the prevention of nu clear war. Unless we can stop the re lentless accumulation of nuclear weap ons, refute the mad doctrine of fight ing and winning a nuclear war, return  to  arms  control  negotiations  and  agreements, and reduce the risk of war  by accident or misjudgment, we will  have no world to pass on to our chil dren. This issue supersedes all others.  I am extremely dissatisfied with this  administration's feeble record on arms  control issues. Where the previous six  Presidents have produced arms control  agreements,  from Eisenhower's 1959  Antarctic Treaty  to Kennedy's 1963  Limited Test Ban Treaty to Johnson's  1968  Non-Proliferation  Treaty  to  Nixon's  197 4 Threshold Test Ban  Treaty to Ford's 1976 Peaceful Nucle ar Explosions Treaty to Carter's SALT  II Offensive Arms Treaty, this Presi dent has produced absolutely nothing.  Indeed, he is on record as having never  supported  a  nuclear  arms  control  agreement.  is  no great  surprise,  then, to learn that the START talks  have stopped, the INF talks are in in definite recess,  the President has re fused  to  resume comprehensive  test  ban negotiations, and SALT II remains  in limbo. The situation is dismal.  Given  the gravity of our predica ment, I am today introducing the secu rity and general disarmament resolu tion, a package of legislative initiatives  that will pull us back from the brink  of nuclear confrontation and  revive  the arms control process.

This year has been a hallmark year  for the recognition of the importance  of efforts  in  this country  to secure  wildlife refuges.  1984 is the 50th anniversary of our  Duck Stamp, the sale of which has se cured 3.5 million acres of wetlands and  wildlife habitats in the United States.  The establishment of Wildlife Habitat  Canada this year underscores Canadi an interest in our mutual concern for  preservation.  Both countries have suffered severe  losses of wetlands, and I'm encouraged  to see us both making efforts to re verse that trend.  I wish for the foundation much suc cess in its efforts to protect essential  wildlife habitat.  ",1984

For the four States that have skills  corporations currently  in operation,  Massachusetts, Minnesota, Washing ton, and Kentucky, plus those States  that establish corporations after en actment of the USSC, a separate pool  of  funds will be established.

Finally,  the USSC will serve not only to fund  State programs, but to provide a clear inghouse function for information re garding skills corporations and the or ganization and sponsorship of relevant  educational activities, such as confer ences, studies, and reports.  In closing, I stress the partnership  nature of this proposal. I believe it will  join the creative energies of business,  the States, and educational  institu tions in a productive effort to assist  economic development and create and  upgrade jobs. It provides a role for the  Federal Government in assisting eco nomic growth, but allows  the major  thrust to come from the business com munity in cooperation with the States.  Additionally, and very importantly, it  retains a State focus;  all  individual  projects are screened and evaluated on  the State level. Thus responsiveness is  assured  and  further  bureaucracy  avoided. I encourage my colleagues to  review this piece of legislation and ask  that hearings be held  in  the near  future.  Many people had an important role  in crafting this legislation. Susan K.  Moulton, Eric Fenn Elbot, and Steve  Shestakofsky of the Bay State Skills  Corp., were invaluable in providing as sistance, suggestions, and resources in  the development of this proposal.

264,Senate,98,-0.379,1050,14,Mr. MATSUNAGA.," Mr. President, I  am  today  introducing with Senators  GORTON,  HEFLIN,  HOLLINGS,  GARN,  INOUYE, PACKWOOD and RIEGLE as CO sponsors, legislation to encourage poli cies, procedures, and operational capa bilities for space rescue.  Mr. President,  it  is an undeniable  truth that the possibility of tragedy in  space increases in proportion to accel erating human  involvement  in space  activities. And as we move ahead with  plans for a manned space station with  international  involvement, which  I  wholeheartedly support, and the fre quency of shuttle flights increases, as  the Soviet Union and other nations  expand their manned spaceflight capa bilities and commitments, it is becom ing imperative that more attention be  paid  to emergency planning for  the  brave men and women who accept the  challenges and risks of space explora tion. Initially, that means recognizing  the fact that the safety of the growing  international corps of astronauts, cos monauts, and spationauts cannot be  effectively protected within a nation alistic framework.  In  the  limitless vastness of space,  emergency  assistance  requires  coop eration on an international scale. The  need for such cooperation  is  in fact  recognized by international treaties, to  which the United States is a signatory,  including  the  ""Agreement  on  the  Rescue of Astronauts,"" the ""Return of  Astronauts and the Return of Objects  Launched  into Outer Space."" More over,  ample  terrestrial  precedent  exists  for  an  international  space  rescue  regime. Emergency assistance  on Earth has always been governed by  a universal code that transcends dif ferences in ideology. Even now, in the  midst of unprecedented cold war ten sion, the United States and the Soviet  Union are linking their space capabili ties  in a Satellite-Aided Search and  Rescue Tracking System  [SARSATl  for locating and rescuing the crews of  downed aircraft and boats in distress  on the high seas. In SARSAT's first 2  weeks of operation, during the fall of  1982, a Soviet satellite guided rescuers  to  two downed aircrafts  in Canada,  one in New Mexico, and to a capsized  yacht 300 miles off the coast of New  England, thereby saving the lives of  seven Americans and Canadians. Since  then, a U.S. satellite has been incorpo rated into the program, to expand its  coverage. Canada and France are also  participating in SARSAT, and other  nations are  lining up  to  join. This  international  program  already  has  been responsible for saving the lives of  200 crew members and passengers of  distressed ships and aircraft.  But, although convincing precedent  exists for space rescue activities, and  although spacefaring nations are com mitted to space rescue in law and in  principle,  the  actual mechanics  of  international space rescue has not yet  been addressed by the affected parties.  The concurrent resolution, which I am  introducing today with seven cospon sors,  urges  that  the United States  show leadership in this humane area  by first, seeking to incorporate inter national space rescue  into space sta tion  planning;  second,  seeking  the  sceintific and technical exchanges nec essary  to  develop  an  international  space rescue regime; and third, exam ining other opportunities for interna tional coordination of U.S. space sta tion programs. With  regard  to  the  space station in particular, it is impor tant that we consider rescue require ments now, while the program is in its  planning stages, so that technical com patibilities, if they are needed, can be  incorporated into design.  In preparing  this  legislation,  I  re ceived assurances  from experts  that  space rescue procedures and compat ibilities could be developed without  risk to national security. Indeed, the  United States is actively seeking inter national involvement in its space sta tion program as part of a civil space  program whose activities, according to  statute, are required  to be free and  open; that's why NASA was created in  the first place. The Soviets, by con trast, have blended civilian and mili tary manned  spaceflight  programs  while conducting both  in an atmos phere of secrecy. We  thus stand to  gain a great deal by encouraging the  openness  that emergency  assistance  coordination would require. It would  provide us with a window onto Soviet  space  activities not otherwise avail able.  Finally, I think it is worth pointing  out that we can draw on significant ex perience in developing a space rescue  program. A primary objective of the  Apollo-Soyuz Test Project [ASTPl of  1975, in which orbiting United States  and Soviet spacecraft linked up and  astronauts  and  cosmonauts met  in  space, was to develop a universal dock ing mechanism  that would facilitate  space rescue. That objective was suecessfully attained. The record in that  instance also shows that, under pres sure of technical imperatives generat ed by ASTP. The Soviets set a number  of precedents for openness,  informa tion exchange, and verification. They  did not do it willingly. They were vir tually forced  into it by pressures in herent  to  cooperative  activity. The  result was not a revolution in behav ior, but it was an extremely promising  beginning. In a letter he wrote to me  about ASTP, one of our astronaut par ticipants,  Donald  ""Deke""  Slayton,  made the following insightful observa tion:  In my opinion, the major thing the Sovi ets could have learned, to their everlasting  benefit, is how to conduct major technical  programs efficiently through the use of free  lateral and vertical comm\mication among  all participants. This would also have been  to our major benefit because it is called de mocracy. Unfortunately,  they  have  not  opted to purloin these lessons yet, but we  should not give up hope.  Unfortunately,  too,  the  universal  docking mechanism  developed  for  ASTP is no longer functional, due to a  lack of followup as the two nations de veloped more advanced manned space  systems. Perhaps that universal dock ing mechanism effort ought to be re newed. At the minimum, as a begin ning, we ought to seek communication  compatibilities and extravehicular pro cedures that would permit rudimenta ry coordination among spacefaring na tions in time of emergency.  Mr. President, no matter how futur istic our advancement into space ap pears,  it can never be considered an  improvement of civilization if it does  not  incorporate  a  commitment  to  rescue fellow human beings in distress.  In April of this year, 11 daring space  explores from three nations were si multaneously  in  orbit  around  the  Earth-five Americans,  five Soviets,  and one Indian. Three Soviets present ly are  in orbit. They will  soon be  joined by five Americans, as manned  space exploration continues to acceler ate. We must not wait for a  tragedy  before taking action on space rescue.  The time to move is now.  Mr. President,  this  legislation has  been  in  the making  for  several  months,  and was  developed  in  its  present form in a bipartisan spirit. We  even forwarded a draft to NASA for its  input a few weeks ago and accepted its  excellent suggestions.  So I was delighted to read in this  morning's newspaper  that President  Reagan proposed only yesterday that  the United States  and  the Soviet  Union  carry out  a  joint  simulated  space rescue mission  involving astro nauts and cosmonauts in orbit. I would  like to think that our discussions with  NASA on this legislation, as well as re lated  legislation  I  introduced with  Senators PELL  and MATHIAS last Feb ruary, had some  influence upon the  ",1984
265,Senate,98,-0.422,1115,14,Mr. HART.," Mr. President, it is my  great pleasure  to recommend  to the  Senate approval of H.R. 3825, legisla tion to establish a boundary for the  Black Canyon of  the Gunnison Na tional Monument in western Colorado.  This  legislation will provide neces sary  authorization  for  the Federal  Government to purchase development  rights to 6, 700 acres on the north rim  of  the canyon, establishing  for  the  first time a statutory northern monu ment boundary. Acquisition of these  conservation  easements will  expand  the monument and  insure  the  long term protection of  the viewshed on  the north rim of the canyon.  The Black Canyon of the Gunnison  has long been heralded as a unique na tional resource. The people of Mon trose County and western Colorado  recognized this and mounted an effort  which culminated in the proclamation  of March  designating  the  Black Canyon as  a national monu ment. The monument was enlarged by  similar actions in 1938-39, and 1960 to  its present size of 13,672 acres. In 1978,  over 11,000 acres of  the monument  were designated wilderness, an effort  this Senator  actively  supported  in  Congress.  Today,  the outstanding vistas and  unique experience afforded visitors to  the Black Canyon of the Gunnison is  threatened by development encroach ing on certain areas of the monument.  As agricultural lands become available  for subdividing, areas along the north ern boundary stand  to  lose, and  in  some cases have already lost, the natu ral beauty visitors expect from the Na tion's parklands. If this threat is not  addressed it will only be a matter of  time before development extends  to  the Gunnison River, severely degrad ing the monument's appeal.  Unfortunately, a situation has devel oped which threatens to permanently  alter  the untouched beauty of  the  canyon. A landowner who owns 4,000  of the 6,700 acres proposed for acquisi tion in this bill has started prelimi nary  construction  activities  on  a  planned vacation home development.  When complete, these homes will be  plainly visible from the south rim of  the canyon where the primary visitor  viewpoints are  located. Should Con gress fail to authorize the purchase of  conservation easements on this prop erty, further construction can be ex pected in coming weeks, permanently  defacing the canyon.  I  believe  this  legislation, which  passed the House last March, repre sents the best approach available  to  preserve  the magnificent beauty of  the black Canyon Monument, one of  several national treasures in the State  of Colorado. Purchase of conservation  easements will cost the Federal Gov ernment substantially less money than  fee simple acquisition of the acreage in  the bill.  In addition,  the  legislation  pending before  the Senate has  the  support of a variety of interests,  in cluding affected landowners, the cities  of Montrose and Delta, the counties of  Montrose and Gunnison,  local busi nesses, the environmental community,  the National Park Service and  the  State of Colorado.  Perhaps most important, the legisla tion  is  in  accordance with  existing  plans of the National Park Service for  the monument. Given  the  present  threat to the monument, it is essential  these longstanding plans of the Park  Service be implemented.  Mr. President, because Congress  is  scheduled  to  adjourn  tomorrow,  I  cannot overstate  the  importance of  Senate action on this bill. By approv ing  this  legislation,  the Senate will  help preserve  for many generations  the spectacular, unspoiled beauty of  the Black Canyon of  the Gunnison  National Monument in Colorado.

As part of this total Federal reim bursement, the bill recommends $155  million  in capital project loans;  this  amount is $40 million more than the  fiscal year 1984 level.

271,House,98,0.014,1349,14,Mr. JEFFORDS.," I thank the gentle man  for  his  comments,  and  I  am  pleased  to note that certainly  there  are others in this body that agree with  me. I would also point out that at the  time  this was brought up and dis cussed it also was done with no vote  and on very short notice.  While I'm at it, let me take a shot at  the civil libertarians, too. We have said  with this legislation that an 18-year old should be able to get blown to bits  in Beirut, but Heaven forbid that he  or she buy a Bloody Mary back home.  I seem to recall a bill, stillborn in the  Energy  and Commerce Committee,  that would have prohibited discrimi nation in insurance based on gender,  race, or nationality. The argument, if I  could summarize  it, was,  ""Why not  look at people as individuals?"" Some  teenage boys are good drivers. Why  should  they  be  treated  arbitrarily  based on their sex?  And why,  I  ask my  colleagues,  should  they  be  treated  arbitrarily  based on their age? There is no ques tion about it, some teenagers do not  drive responsibly. So why not require  the driving age be raised to 21? Exces sive teenage drinking does not endan ger anyone in most cases, bad driving  does, whether it's under the influence  of booze or drugs, or simply a high speed joy ride.  Why don't we raise the driving age?  Well, that's an issue for the States to  decide. You bet  it  is,  and so's the  drinking age. The States don't think  that they should have  to submit to  this Federal blackmail, and  I don't  either. The National Governors' Asso ciation has gone on record in opposi tion, and I would be remiss if I did not  also mention the considerable courage  shown on this issue by my own State's  Governor, Richard Snelling,  a  past  president of the' NGA.  By the way, what happened to the  States' rights  advocates  last night?  Looks  like  the Sagebrush Rebellion  has a bad case of stage fright.  The young people in this country,  too, share in this mess. My office has  received only a handful of mail on this  issue  from young Vermonters. They  and their peers had better wake up to  the fact that their interests can only  be  represented  if  their  voices  are  heard. Last night they lost the privi lege to drink as far as Congress is con cerned. Who knows what they will lose  on the eve of the next recess?  Without a  doubt, we need  to do  something  to  reduce  the number of  drunk drivers on our Nation's roads.  But it is a vast oversimplification to  think that this problem will go away  by increasing the drinking age.  We have all heard the statistics that  18to 21-year-olds make up 9 percent  of the country's drinking population  yet they are involved in 17 percent of  all alcohol-related accidents. Sure this  figure is high, but what of the remain ing 83 percent of the accidents? An in crease in the drinking age is not about  to touch this group. Raising the drink ing age  is a copout, a band-aid ap proach to a very serious problem. We  need to actively address this issue and  not hide behind a carrot and stick idea  passed one night with the hope that  all will be fine the next.  Rather  than  the Federal Govern ment intruding upon a traditional re sponsibility of the States, I think our  time would be better spent becoming  involved  in programs and  initiatives  that will get at the heart of this prob lem. Instead of a reward of transporta tion funds, how about a reward of in creased  education  funds  for States  that institute mandatory educational  programs on the dangers of drinking  and driving?  The idea of encouraging stiff crimi nal penalties for drunk driving  is a  good one. This cuts across  all  age  groups and does not require the sin gling out of any one group. A drunk  driver of any age  is a menace and  should be controlled. I can support our  encouragement of this type of action  by the States.  We must really look at what we have  done by increasing the drinking age.  Could we  be  promoting  backyard,  house party, even on-the-road drink ing instead of the relatively supervised  drinking in a bar or restaurant? What  we need is a higher level of conscious ness on this issue among a broad range  of groups and individuals: individuals  of drinking age, parents, teachers, leg islators, bar and  restaurant owners,  enforcement officials, et cetera. If this  will  take a combination of education  and enforcement, let's get on with it.  But,  let's not think that w~ can sit  back and pat ourselves on the back for  increasing the drinking age to 21.  And let's not get too sanctimonious  in the future about our willingness,  our eagerness,  to  take on the tough  issues. Last night was a sad day for  this body. Let there not be another  one.

272,House,98,-0.429,1349,14,Mr. SOLARZ.," Mr. Speaker, tonight  I have requested a special order, along  with Representative  FRANK,  Repre sentative AcKERMAN, and Representa tive LANTos, so that we in the House of  Representatives might have  this op portunity to pay tribute to a remarka ble community of men, women, and  children, the Ethiopian Jews.  This week of June 24  to July 1 is  being celebrated in many places across  the United States, Canada, and Israel  as an International Week of Solidarity  with Ethiopian Jewry. It is an oppor tunity for all of us engaged  in the  struggle for greater international rec ognition  and observance  of human  rights to recognize the truly remarka ble men, women, and children whom  we seek to aid. These people fully ap preciate  the  importance  of human  rights, and what it is like to live as a  threatened minority, yet they are will ing to pay any price, endure any hard ship to protect their most precious and  cherished heritage and traditions. The  Jews of Ethiopia are just one of the  many  groups  of  people  struggling  today  to protect and preserve  their  way of  life against the pressures of  governmental  indifference,  hostility,  and sometimes the indifference of the  international  community.

273,,98,-0.044,1388,14,Mr. GREEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to the Hon. David  Norton Edelstein for his 33 years of  outstanding service on the U.S. Dis trict Court for the Southern District  of New York.  It  is my pleasure  to  bring  to  the  attention of my  col leagues in the U.S. House of Repre sentatives the accomplishments of this  dedicated servant of the law.  Judge Edelstein received his masters  degree and his law degree from Ford ham University. Upon admittance to  the New York State Bar, he began his  long and distinguished career of public  service as an assistant U.S. attorney  for the Southern District of New York  in 1945. His enthusiasm and  intelli gence earned him the respect of his  superiors, and, only 6 years later, he  was nominated judge of the U.S. Dis trict Court for the Southern District  of New York. In 1971, he was nominat ed chief judge.  These accomplishments bespeak a  first-rate legal mind, but they do not  give due credit to the numerous contri butions Judge Edelstein has made to  his profession over the years. For ex ample, he is a former elected member  of  the  Judicial Conference of  the  United States, the Attorney General's  Conference on Crime,  the Steering  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Committee of the New York Federal  Executive Board, the Planning Com mittee of the Metropolitan Conference  of Chief Judges, and the founder of  the  student  litigation  training pro gram for the Southern District. Judge  Edelstein has also been active in nu merous professional associations,  in cluding the Federal Bar Association,  the American Bar Association, and the  American Trial Lawyers Association.  In view of these and other accom plishments, it is clear that the Nation  owes Judge Edelstein a debt of grati tude for the energy and enlightened  leadership he has provided during the  past  33  years.  Perhaps  his  distin guished career is best summed up by  paraphrasing  the  great  American  jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes:  ""The  rule of joy and the law of duty seem to  him all one.""  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I call upon  my colleagues in the Congress of the  United States to join me in this oppor tunity to pay tribute to the Honorable  David Norton Edelstein.e  BUFFALO'S CHICKEN WINGS  MARK 20TH ANNIVERSARY  HON.HENRYJ.NOWAK  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 28, 1984   ",1984

The event marks the 20th anniversary of  the  invention of Buffalo-style wings  by  Frank and Teressa Bellissimo at their res taurant, Frank and Teressa's Anchor Bar,  Main and East North Street, Buffalo.  June 28, 1984  Actually,  the wing  snack was  created  there  in July 1964. Nevertheless, Mayor  Griffin has designated the week of June 25July 1 as ""Buffalo Chicken Wing Festival '  Week,""  The observance at  the Capitol was ar ranged by Reps. John J. LaFalce, D-Town of  Tonawanda, and Henry J. Nowak, D-Buffa lo, with the cooperation of House Doorkeep er James T. Molloy, a former Buffalo fire fighter.  Their will be a welcoming ceremony of  sorts at the south entrance of the Capitol  involving the congressmen, Mr. Molloy and  a model hired in Washington to play the  part of ""the Buffalo Chicken, Wilhelmina  Wing.""  The wings  and  the  transportation are  being provided by a subsidiary of the Dela ware North Companies Inc., which provides  food service at a number of airports includ ing Greater Buffalo  International  and  Washington National.  Representing Delaware North will  be  Peter Castrilli, Washington regional direc tor of its Air Terminal Services subsidiary,  and Ernest Wooden, boss of the Sport Serv ice subsidiary here, concessionaire at the  Washington Convention Center.  Mr. Molloy, whose help was required be cause he  controls  the House  restaurant  system, said he is sure that House members  will be able to consume only a minority of  the donated wings.  He said as a result, he will see they are  shared with House staffers and others.  Buffalo-style chicken wings are among the  fast foods sold  in the converted old Post  Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, now called  the Pavilion. The popularity of the dish has  spread to Harbor Place in Baltimore and as  far away as London.  The delicacy has supplanted beef on kum melweck as the most popular dish at the  annual Buffalo Night Party staged by Rep.  Nowak; Rep. Jack F. Kemp, R-Hamburg;  and Rep. LaFalce in one of the House office  buildings.  This is the first tribute to wings in the  Capitol. Perhaps they'll get a reception in  the White House Rose Garden on their 25th  anniversary.  [From the New York Times, June 27, 19841  CHICKEN WINGS OF BUFFALO  This week  is Buffalo Chicken Wings  Week,  according  to  a  proclamation  by  Mayor James Griffin. The city's famous cul inary product was created on the spur of a  moment in July 1964 by Teressa Bellissimo,  opening  the  kitchen  of  her  husband's  Anchor Bar on Main Street while her son  Dominic tended bar out front.  A bunch of the buddies were drinking and  enjoying  theinselves,"" Dominic Bellissimo,  who is frequently known as Rooster, said re cently, recalling the historic occasion. ""It  was a Friday night at exactly 12 o'clock.  Mother went into the icebox, where there  was a big platter of chicken wings. She  chopped them down the middle, she impro vised a barbecue sauce which we continue to  use to this day with very little embellish ment and she got out the blue cheese dress ing we used for the salad. She brought out  this big platter and my buddies at the bar  went crazy.  It took a  good month,  five  weeks, and they just mushroomed into what  today has become a business within  the  business.''  It goes without saying that the ingredi ents of the masterpiece are secret. Mr. Bel lissimo says he does not even make the bar",1984
275,House,98,-0.321,9,18,Mr. SYNAR.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman for his kind remarks.  Mr. Speaker, it has indeed been an  eventful 10 days for the Subcommittee  on Health and the Environment of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce  and let me take this opportunity to  commend Chairman WAXMAN for the  outstanding job that he has done. I  hope that as we did last week with the  patent restoration bill, we can have  unanimous  support  from  this body  with respect to this bill.  I would  like  to  join with my col league from Tennessee [Mr. GoRE] in  ",1984
276,House,98,-0.396,35,18,Mr. MORRISON of Connecticut.,"  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  bill,  H.R.  3347,  the  Extradition  Reform Act of 1984. This bill is the  product of the work of the Committee  on  the Judiciary over  the past  two  Congresses. The chairman of the Sub committee on Crime, my distinguished  colleague  from  New  Jersey  HUGHES], is to be congratulated.  Last Congress the committee report ed a bill which raised serious concerns  in  the  community of persons  con cerned  about  international  human  rights, and, due to the heavy agenda  at the end of the session, that bill was  not voted on. This Congress the com mittee began  the  legislative process  again, and-in my view-improved on  its work. This Congress the committee  further refined the definition of a po litical offense and, most importantly,  met the legitimate concerns about the  need to add additional procedural pro tections to guard against the abuse of  human rights.  The bill before us this afternoon has  the strong support of  the American  Bar Association, the Association of the  Bar of the city of New York, and the  American Civil Liberties Union. This is  so because  the bill dramatically  im proves Federal law by providing the  Federal  courts with  authority  to  refuse  to extradite a person  if  that  person establishes by a preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  the  person's  return will result in either impermissi ble persecution or subject the person  to fundamental unfairness. This safe guard is derived from the United Na tions Convention and Protocol on the  Status of Refugees and parallels the  treatment given to alleged offenders in  virtually  all  modern  democracies.  Great Britain, the Federal Republic of  Germany, Israel, Australia, New Zea land, India, and Sweden, for example,  all permit courts to inquire into the  bona fides of an extradition request.  Opponents of this feature of the bill  argue that Federal courts should not  be involved in such foreign policy mat ters. That type of argument has also  been made-and rejected-only recent ly by the House in the context of po litical asylum decisions. We all know  that the Department of State must, of  necessity, make decisions about indi vidual issues-including extradition re quests-in the context of our total re lations with other countries. There is  almost an  inherent conflict  in  roles  when we ask the Department of State  to make judicial determinations about  whether an alleged offender will  re ceive nondiscriminatory, fundamental ly fair treatment in a requesting coun try. It is unavoidable that the Depart ment of State will be asked to refuse a  person's extradition because of allega tions of persecution or grossly abusive  treatment in the requesting country.  It is virtually impossible for that polit ical department to weigh that individual human rights claim without con sidering the ramifications any decision  would have on our relations with that  nation. Thus, reliance on the Federal  courts to resolve  these  issues  is the  only fair and objective method for re solving these issues.  I also note that the bill contains an  important  amendment which  I  au thored, which was adopted in commit tee. Under the bill a person like the  late Senator Aquino of the Phillipines,  who was charged with a conspiracy,  would still have been able to avoid ex tradition by asserting the political of fense  defense.  Opponents  of my  amendment want  to  preclude  such  protection. This view is shortsighted.  If an alleged offender conspired and  completed a heinous act, the defense is  unavailable. Under my amendment, all  that is permitted is the assertion of a  defense if mere inchoate conduct is al leged.  I strongly urge my colleagues to sup port this measure.e  ",1984

278,,98,0.283,100,18,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, cloture  has been invoked now. It is my under standing,  however,  that  the distin guished  junior Senator  from New  York and perhaps other Senators do  not wish  to proceed directly  to  the  vote on the motion to proceed, and  they have that right. We are now in a  postcloture situation, with a limitation  of  time  as  to each Sentor. But  I  wonder if I could propound now anal ternative arrangement to stay tonight  to finish the postcloture procedure.  Mr. President, I have consulted with  the  junior Senator from New York,  and with the minority leader, and I  now inquire of the minority leader and  the  two managers whether or not  there might be a willingness to provide  for a vote tomorrow at 11 o'clock on  the motion to proceed, provided that  the Senator  from New York  D'AMATO] would have his hour under  rule XXII, from 10 o'clock until 11  o'clock, and that, tomorrow, the two  managers, the Senator from Utah and  the Senator  from Wisconsin, would  have 15 minutes each. That would be  90 minutes of debate tomorrow, and  then a vote would occur.  Also, if it meets the general approval  of the Senator from West Virginia, the  minority  leader,  I  say  to any other  Senators who  wish  to  debate  the  matter that I am willing to ask the  Senate to remain tonight as long as  necessary.  Mr. President, did I say 11 a.m. or  11:30 a.m. in my description?  ",1984

281,,98,-0.088,113,18,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. Speaker, my  very  esteemed  friend, Maj.  Gen.  Donald S. Dawson, gave the keynote  address at the Reserve Officers Asso ciation Convention in Chicago recent ly and spoke eloquently about the late  President Harry S. Truman, his devot ed friend. What he said is worthy of  wide reading and I, therefore, include  it here in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  Mr. President, distinguished guests, hon ored past presidents, ladies of the ROAL,  my fellow officers, I am highly honored to  have this invitation to take another early  morning walk with President Truman. Not  down Pennsylvania Avenue and up to the  Capitol this time, nor with the Secret Serv ice, but a stroll down memory lane, with one  of the great men of history-one who has  meant so much to ROA.  The Reserve Officers Association is dedi cating this convention to an outstanding Re serve Officer, Harry S. Truman, who rose  from National Guard private in 1905 to cap tain-on active duty in France in World War  I and then by Presidential election became  Commander-in-Chief  of  all  our Armed  Forces.  He was a preeminent example of the citi zen soldier-the example set by our first  President, George Washington.  Born in Lamar, Missouri, he grew to man hood on a Missouri farm near Independ ence. He was a farmer. His mother said he  could plow the straightest furrow in Jack son County, Missouri, and that was behind a  walking plow pulled by a mule-no high powered tractor.  During  the 1948 Presidential campaign  when he had literally been living on the  ""whistle-stop"" train, making a dozen speech es a day and shaking thousands of hands, I  asked him how he seemed so full of energy  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  and never tired of doing all the things we  put upon him, when his staff-much young er-was worn out.  After a moment's reflection he said. ""I  think it is because I was behind a plow at  the right time of life.''  He also knew the life of a small  town,  where he went to school and fell in love on  his first day at Sunday school, when he was  six, with the prettiest girl he ever saw and  later married after the war-a long court ship, one that was to last all of his life.  He worked as a railroad timekeeper. He  worked in the post office, in a drug store, as  a bank clerk in the big city-Kansas City,  tried his hand at oil well development,  which did not work out, and owned a small  haberdashery after the war with his buddy,  Eddie Jacobson, that went broke.  Many stores in the Midwest failed in that  advance tremor of the Great Depression, so  there was little mystery or shame. Indeed,  what struck most people was not his failure  but how he handled it. He refused to take  bankruptcy, as was commonly done, and  over the next 20 years he paid off some  $20,000 in haberdashery debts, down to the  dollar. He was still paying them off while he  was in the Senate, when the salary was only  $10,000 a year and when he could barely  made ends meet in Washington.  If there was one  turning point  in his  career, it was his success as an artillery offi cer in World War I. He need never have  gone to war. He has applied to West Point  and had been turned down because of poor  eyesight. He was past 30, and he was needed  on the family farm, where he had worked  for 11 years.  As Captain Harry Truman of the 129th  Field Artillery in France, he was a triumph,  as is plain in the record. His 1918 service  record says, ""This officer  is an excellent  Battery Commander. He is unusually well equipped and is an excellent instructor. He  is resourceful and dependable.""  He was put in command in France of an  unruly Kansas City unit, Battery D,  the  regiment's most troubled unit, more than  200 men who were mostly Irish who did not  go easy on any officer, let alone one in big  hom-rimmed glasses who still looked a lot  like a bank clerk. He was the fourth officer  in less than a year.  Truman later wrote, ""They called them selves the Irish Battery and it did sound as  if the Hibernians were meeting when the  roll was called, except that now and then,  along with the MeKims and Caseys and the  Donnellys, there'd be Schmidt and a Meis berger.""  The morning he  took over, he was as  frightened as he ever had been. ""I didn't  come here to get along with you,"" he told  the non-coms. ""You've got to get along with  me. And if there are any of you who can't speak up, and I'll bust you back now.""  At St. Mihiel and  the Argonne Forest,  through some of the heaviest fighting seen  by any American unit in the war, he proved  himself tough, courageous and consistently  popular. His men said: ""he was the boss of  the outfit.'' ""he not only commanded it, he  owned it."" ""We felt he knew what he was  doing.'' ""He was the best in the world."" ""on  firing problems we began to hit the target.""  After two months in France, his unit went  to the front-before they had finished their  training.  In the first shelling by the Germans, Vie  Householder saw Captain Truman's horse  go down, its belly tom open by shrapnel. He  rushed over and found Truman lying there  with only his upper chest and head sticking  24729  ranks on  driving Missouri  out from under the horse. They dragged  him out and he quickly recovered. Then,  using  language  learned  mules, he brought his men together. They  now saw him as a cool captain under fire,  and some even spoke of him as a good luck  piece for the battery.  On another occasion,  the enemy began  shelling Battery D's position. Three rounds  landed close and some nervous Nellie yelled,  ""Let's get out of here."" Several men ran  over Truman, knocking him into the mud as  he was coming out of his command dugout.  He jumped up, pulled his pistol and shout ed, ""Any SOB who isn't back in position in  ten seconds will be shot."" They made  it  back, and later called it the ""Battle of Who  Run.""  ""He was  tough, but he was  fair,"" said  Gene Donnelly. Some have gone so far as to  say, ""He was one of the kindest and most  thoughtful men I've ever known.""  After the war, he maintained a personal  relationship with each of the men in Bat tery D, which  lasted  through  the years.  Countless times I have seen him recollect  from memory where they were, what they  were doing, how their families were. He kept  a little black book in the left bottom drawer  of his Presidential desk in the Oval Office  with  the address of each, with personal  notes about them, that were up-to-date.  He was never too busy to see any of them  and enjoy old  times whenever  they hap pened to be in Washington or wherever he  was,  throughout the country. He attended  every  reunion,  even  as  President  and  marched  in  their ever-thinning  parade.  After  the war Captain Harry  became  Major Truman  in the Army Reserve, as signed to the 102nd Reserve Division. The  educational program he and his fellow re servists initiated served the Army for years  as a model reserve training program which  was used throughout the country. General  Harry Smith, Commanding Officer of the  VI Corps, addressing the Kansas City re serve officers commended the Kansas City  reservists as the ""best coordinated effort in  the nation.""  Truman became active  in the American  Legion and helped with the 1921 Conven tion in Kansas City. A few days after the  Convention,  he met with  several  other  World War I veterans and members of the  Officers Reserve Corps at Morton's Restau rant and decided to start a club of all re serve officers in the Kansas City Area-the  Reserve Officers Club  of Kansas City,  which became Kansas City Chapter No.1 of  ROA.  Harry Truman was Army: make no mis take about it. He loved the military from  boyhood. While he was President, he said at  a Medal of Honor presentation  that he  would rather have earned the medal himself  than be President. As President, he was con vinced of the vital necessity for universal  military training for all your youth. He lost  that fight to the Congress, but never his in terest in a strong reserve program, which he  knew was the force on which our country  must ultimately depend in time of national  emergency.  I said he rose from Private to Captain in  World War I, but he was never a Second  Lieutenant. In those days the men elected  their officers in the National Guard and he  was elected First Lieutenant. He later said,  when his political popularity was at a low  ebb, he did not know whether he could win  that election again.  ",1984
282,House,98,-0.3,178,18,Mr. YOUNG of Missouri.," Mr. Speak er, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill <H.R. 5607) to authorize  and direct the Librarian of Congress,  subject to the supervision and author ity of a Federal civilian or military  agency, to proceed with the construc tion of the Library of Congress Mass  Book Deacidification Facility, and for  other purposes.  The Clerk read as follows:  H.R. 5607  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United Statu of  America in Congress assembled, That the Li brarian of Congress  is authorized and di rected, subJect to the supervision and con struction authority of a Federal civilian or  military agency, to construct the Library of  Congress Mass Book Deacidification Facility  in accordance with the general design devel oped by the Library of Congress and re viewed by the Architect of the Capitol, as  set forth in the document entitled ""Library  of Congress Mass book Deacidification Fa cility, Engineering, Design, and Cost Esti mate and Drawings"", dated December 1983.  Such facility shall be constructed on Feder al property within seventy-five miles of the  United States Capitol Building.  SEC. 2. Notwithstanding any other provi sion of law, the Librarian of Congress shall  equip, furnish, operate, and maintain the Li brary of Congress Mass Book Deacidifica tion Facility.  SEC. 3.

284,House,98,-0.122,230,18,Mr. SISISKY.," Mr. Speaker, I under stand  that  these  technical  amend ments are simply correcting oversights  of the Housing and Urban-Rural Re covery Act of last year and therefore a  matter of importance  to my district  has not been included. That matter is  maintaining the community develop ment block grant [CDBGl entitlement  status of those communities which lost  their status as central cities after the  last census. As I understand it, 19 com munities under 50,000 no longer meet  the definition of central city of a met ropolitan area and therefore will not  be entitled for CDBG funding after  fiscal year 1985. For the first  time,  studies of commuting patterns were  used  to  identify central cities,  and  these cities were dedesignated because  they do not attract enough workers.  Since attracting workers is a key to a  healthy  and vibrant  economy,  this  methodology has eliminated some very  distressed and struggling communities,  which are very much in need of CDBG  funding. One of  these communities,  the city of Hopewell, VA, is in my dis trict. I am also speaking on behalf of  my colleague, Mr.  liEPNER of North  Carolina, who represents the commu nities of Concord and Salisbury, NC,  which are also affected by this change.  Mr. Speaker, I can appreciate that in  the crush of business the committee  has limited its considerations this year  to matters of immediate concern, but  could you assure me that when the  committee considers legislation in the  next Congress, it will review the situa tion of these small cities as the com mittee conducts hearings and marks  up the legislation?

286,House,98,-0.174,243,18,Mr. YATRON.," I  thank the gentle man for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker,  I want  to commend  both  the  chairman,  the gentleman  from Florida [Mr. FASCELL] and the  gentleman from Iowa [Mr. LEAcH] for  the leadership roles  that they have  played in bringing this issue of torture  to the forefront.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support  House Joint Resolution 605,legislation  regarding U.S. policy in opposition to  the practice of torture by any foreign  government.  Millions of  individuals  throughout  the world experience acts of cruelty  too brutal to imagine. They are victim ized by their governments, the very in stitution which should protect them.  In addition to the inhumanities these  people have  to  endure,  they must  endure yet another obstacle-the un willingness on the part of well-mean ing people outside of their government  to  look at or  listen  to  their story.  Seeing proof of torture is too difficult  for many to face, but face it we must.  The  Subcommittee  on  Human  Rights  and  International Organiza tions, which I chair, held a series of  hearings on the phenomenon of tor ture. Thanks to the efforts of Amnesty  International  and various other  human rights organizations, we were  able  to  look closely at this heinous  crime, to see how it affects human life,  and to plan specific actions to combat  this cruelty.  Torture  is  a brutal and powerful  enemy. We can combat and ultimately  defeat this horrifying practice by sup porting  positive measures  such  as  House Joint Resolution 605. Our fight  to eradicate  this universal  tragedy,  torture, must be a continual and deter mined one. We in the United States  have been spared the endless agony  torture victims throughout the world  are realizing, but we have not been  spared  the responsibility of fighting  against this injustice.  I would like to commend Mr. FAs the distinguished chairman of  the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for  introducing this very worthwhile legis lation.  ",1984
287,House,98,-0.123,256,18,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. Speaker, H.R.  5464, would establish a National Wild life Refuge consisting of several small  islands and a barrier beach along the  Connecticut coast. These  islands are  valuable habitat for a number of spe cies of wildlife, most notably herons,  terns, and other shore and wading  birds. The refuge would become part  of  the  National Wildlife  Refuge  System and would be managed by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service pursu ant to the National Wildlife Refuge  System Administration Act of  and other applicable statutes. The leg islation contains an authorization of  $2.5 million  for  acquisition of  the  refuge.  Mr. Speaker, the areas that would be  included  in  the National Wildlife  Refuge System following the passage  of this legislation will be worthy addi tions to a system that now includes  over  national wildlife  refuges.  Chimon  Island,  the  largest of  the  areas that would be included, supports  Connecticut's most significant heron  rookery and one of the largest wading  bird colonies on  the northern  sea board.  Falkner's  Island,  currently  owned by the Coast Guard, supports  Connecticut's only breeding popula tion of roseate terns and most of the  nesting population of common terns.  1966  400  Milford Point is one of the few nesting  areas remaining for the piping plover  and other shore birds. Sheffield Island  also has great potential as habitat for  shore and wading birds.  The legislation was amended in com mittee to change the name of the pro posed refuge to the Connecticut Coast al National Wildlife Refuge to reflect  the fact  that the refuge contains a  number of units along the Connecticut  coast.  H.R. 5464 also includes a provision  to clarify the use of funds appropri ated to the Fish and Wildlife Service  under  the Supplemental Appropria tions Act, recently signed by the Presi dent, to acquire lands within the At chafalaya Basin in Louisiana. That act  appropriated $10 million to the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service to acquire  lands under the Fish and Wildlife Act  of 1956 and other authority.  For those of you not familiar with  Louisiana,  the Atchafalaya Basin  is  one of the great natural areas of this  Nation. It is essentially a huge river  swamp,  encompassing  more  than  500,000 acres of wetlands  that may  produce as much wildlife as any area  in the country. It is home to an aston ishing diversity of wildlife,  including  herons, egrets, and other wading birds;  mallards, wood ducks, and countless  other waterfowl;  black bears,  deer,  bobcat, muskrat, and other mammals;  and  countless  alligators.  From  its  wasters comes the Louisiana crawfish,  an indispensable part of cajun cuisine,  as well as bass, catfish, and other fish.  The debate over conservation of the  Atchafalaya Basin has been going on  for years in Louisiana. Flood control,  agriculture,  energy  development,  recreation. and other interests in the  basin were difficult to reconcile. Re cently, however, all of the parties in volved developed an agreement that  resolves  the major  disputes.  The  agreement, which is incorporated in a  plan developed by the Corps of Engi neers for the basin, specifies flood con trol measures, water flow  rates, and  the purchase of flowage easements de signed to keep the basin in a natural  state while providing flood protection  for surrounding communities.  The plan also calls for the acquisi tion and management of 90,000 acres  within the basin for public access. The  Dow Chemical Co. has donated 40,000  acres. The acquisition of the remain ing 50,000 acres is to be split between  the State of Louisiana and the Federal  Government. All of the public access  lands are to be managed by the State  of Louisiana. The State has recently  purchased approximately 10,000 acres  and has plans  to acquire additional  lands in the near future.  Authorization for  the  implementa tion of the comprehensive plan for the  Atchafalaya, including the acquisition  of public access lands by the Corps of  Engineers, is included in the water resources legislation that has passed the  House.  The provision relating to the Atcha falaya  included  in H.R. 5464 simply  clarifies how  the Service  is  to use  funds contained in the fiscal year 1984  Supplemental  Appropriation  Act.  Lands acquired will become part of the  national wildlife  refuge  system but  will be managed by the State under a  cooperative agreement with the Fish  and Wildlife Service. The National  Wildlife Refuge Administration Act  requires that refuges are to be admin istered by the Secretary of the Interi or through the Fish and Wildlife Serv ice. However,  it would make  little  sense to split the management respon sibilities of the basin between Federal  and State agencies. Since the State is  already managing in excess of 50,000  acres in the basin, it is only sensible  that they should be the management  authority. It is our  intent that the  area be managed by the State in a  manner consistent with the provisions  of the National Wildlife Refuge Ad ministration Act and other applicable  statutory authority.  The  legislation,  as  amended,  also  provides that the area is to be consid ered as part of the refuge system for  the purposes of the Refuge Revenue  Sharing Act. This act provides in lieu  of tax payments to local governments.  This is consistent with the policy for  other refuges managed under coopera tive agreements, such as Matagorda  Refuge in Texas.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to con gratulate  the members of  the Con necticut delegation, al of whom co sponsored  this  legislation and all of  whom have worked diligently to assure  its passage. Through their efforts, we  will protect one of the few remaining  natural  areas  in  Connecticut  for  future generations.e   ",1984

This legislation establishes  a Connecticut Coastal National Wild life Refuge on Chimon Island, Milford  Point, Faulkner's Island, and Sheffield  Island in the State of Connecticut. In  addition,  the  legislation directs that  Public Law 98-396 lands in the Atcha falaya Basin in Louisiana be included  in the national wildlife refuge system.  The wildlife refuge proposed in this  bill is important to the State of Con necticut. Our State, in the middle of  the Boston-New York  corridor,  is  highly urbanized, the cost of land is  high and open spaces are at a premi um.

This pro gram reflects a long-standing tradition  of voluntarism in this country but is,  nevertheless, unique in that it puts to  use the valuable talents and contribu tions of approximately 5,000 older vol unteers who are working in over 90  Senior Companion Programs  across  the country.  The  Senior Companion  Program  provides a stipend volunteer peer-sup port  system  for  the  frail  elderly.  Through  this  program,  low-income  Americans over the age of 60 serve as  senior companion for older adults in  their homes, nursing homes, or resi dential  institutions. Senior compan ions generally are required to work 20  hours per week. For  their  services  they receive a stipend of $2 per hour, a  hot meal,  transportation, an annual  physical examination, and  insurance  coverage. Such remunerations are, in  turn, of significant help to senior com panions as they themselves are often  living  on  only minimal  retirement  and/or Social Security benefits.  In addition to providing companion ship, senior companions take updated  knowledge and skills to their clients  who face a variety of limiting health  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  conditions and often isolation. As vol unteers, they work under the direction  of supervisors  in health and  social  services agencies and often attend edu cational  programs  addressing  such  topics as health, nutrition, household  management,  consumer  issues,  and  energy conservation.  Demographers predict that we are  moving toward a population with more  older people, including a large number  of healthy people over the age of 60.  As  the number of elderly  increases,  however, so does that segment of the  population with  functional  impair ments-those  in need of  long-term  care. Nearly  12 million  frail  older  people will need some  type of long term care in this decade, but as health  care costs continue to rise, the finan cial ability to access these services be comes difficult, if not impossible, for  most needy families. A recent Federal  study, as reported in the Wall Street  Journal of March 8, 1983, found that  if present trends continue, the $23 bil lion a year that it now costs to support  skilled nursing facilities would more  than triple by 1990.  The value of senior companions is  that they can provide or arrange for  the personal services needed to keep  the frail elderly in their homes. Ex pensive professionals are used only for  emergency or highly defined services  rather than for activities that a com panion can do as well or even better.  Although long-term care professionals  are a key element, they function pri marily as trainers and emergency care givers rather than as providers for all  services. This frees the professional to  handle more complex situations.  Senior companions constitute a vital  link between professional service pro viders and the elderly while also creat ing  a  network  linking  frail  older  people in a sustaining and nurturing  relationship.  In effect,  through  the  Senior Companion Program, the elder ly help the elderly, and as was recent ly reported by the Select Committee  on Aging Subcommittee on Human  Services, ...    who better knows the  needs of elders than those that are  senior adults?""  Senior Americans  constitute  the  single most neglected human resource  we have. This is an unfortunate and  an unnecessary waste to this society,  as they possess a  lifetime of experi ence and talents to offer this Nation. I  am proud to have been an original co sponsor of House Concurrent Resolu tion 333, commemorating the Senior  Companion Program, and I will con tinue to support programs and legisla tion that appreciate  the community  involvement of our older citizens.  I am certain that as this and similar  programs become better known, they  will be welcomed in every community.  But more importantly, I am hopeful  that  through  their  implementation,  the valuable talents of our senior citiSeptember 11, 1984  zens will be fully acknowledged and  utilized at long last.e  THE SALE OF CONRAIL  HON.

290,,98,-0.192,321,18,Mr. RUSSO.," Mr. Speaker, this year  celebrates the lOth anniversary of the  Mother Cabrini Award. The Colum bus-Cuneo-Cabrini  Medical  Center  bestows,  this,  its highest honor, on  those individuals who have worked un selfishly for the benefit of those less  fortunate, very much like Mother Ca brini herself. St. Cabrini was born to a  family of 12  children  in Lombardi,  Italy. Although she was never phys ically strong, she worked to carry the  burden of others.  At the age of 24 she took her first  religious vows, and 6 years later she  founded her own order, the Mission ary Sisters of the Sacred Heart. When  she recognized the needs of Italian im migrants in the United States, Mother  Cabrini sailed to New York where she  established an orphanage. In 1892, she  founded Columbus Hospital. In 1909,  Mother Cabrini became a naturalized  citizen of the United States. She had  already given so much to this coun try's poor and homeless, but she treas ured the honor of becoming an Ameri can and worked harder to be worthy  of her new home. She traveled the  country, opening schools and orphan ages in Denver, Seattle, Los Angeles,  and Chicago. Her cheerfulness and  sense of humor were an inspiration to  all of those she helped. Mother Ca brini became ill and died in 1917.  The love and hope she brought to so  many immigrants prompted the Vati can to declare her life an heroic one,  and she was canonized on July 7, 1946.  The Mother Cabrini Award, which  this year honors Mr.  Irv Kupcinet,  Sun-Times  columnist,  and Mr. Ste phen Ruff, Sr., Chicago attorney, re minds us that service to others is the  highest calling. Our service to others  is rendered in the way we live our lives  each day, regardless of what work we  have chosen. Both men honored by  this award richly deserve this recogni tion. Highly successful in their chosen  fields, they could have been satisfied  with  this as enough.  Instead,  they  have chosen to remember the needs of  others and have given unselfishly of  their  time and  talents.  I  join with  their friends  in congratulating them  and commend  the Columbus-Cuneo Cabrini Medical Center for their own  dedicated service.e  HON. GLENN M.

291,,98,-0.269,321,18,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker, on  Friday, September 14, a very special  lady will be honored at a dinner to be  held at the Rio Hondo Inn in Downey,  CA. Opal Henn will receive this tribute  from her friends for all the many com munity activities that she has been in volved with over the years.  Opal was born in Redlands, CA, and  later moved to Orange County where  she  attended  schools  in Placentia,  Huntington Beach, and Santa Ana.  She then moved to Downey where she  comnpleted high school. After attend ing Long Beach City College  for 1  year, Opal began working for the Pa cific Telephone Co. While there, her  most exciting job was manager of the  Bell System's ""America the Beautiful""  exhibit at Disneyland.  With her  retirement  from Pacific  Telephone, Opal began working at her  true love, volunteer service and help ing people. She has been involved with  many groups as a volunteer. She has  been a member of the American Heart  Association for  the past 26 years, a  member of the American Cancer Soci ety, charter member of the Downey  Quota Club International, and helped  organize  the Downey Coordinating  Council as a member of  the Quota  Club. Opal is a member of the Downey  Historical Society, and  the Downey  Rose Float Association where she has  acted as chaperon for Miss Downey  and her court for the past 10 years. It  is interesting to note that Opal was  the first Miss Downey, and continues  to be active in the Miss Downey pag eant.  She is a member of the American As sociation of Retired Persons, Chapter  262,  in Downey; a volunteer for the  Downey Youth Employment Office;  the Downey Theatre; member of the  Keep Downey Beautiful Committee;  and serves on the Sister City Commit tee.  Opal was also the organizer and co ordinator of the Robbie Diaz Olympic  Committee to send Robbie, Downey's  deaf swimmer,  to the Deaf Olympic  games held in Berlin, Germany. She  also worked with the city, the cham ber of commerce, and the RTD Trans portation Committee, selling Olympic  tokens to businesses in Downey.  An active member and past presi dent  of  the  Downey  Republican  Women Federation, Opal is a newly  elected member of  the Los Angeles  County Republican Central Commit tee, 63d Assembly District. She is a  member of the California Republican  Assembly and honorary member of  81-059 o-87-11 (Pt. 18)  ",1984
292,Senate,98,-0.142,386,18,Mr. BOREN.," Mr. President, I would  like  to  join with my colleague from  Nebraska  in sponsoring  this amend ment  to  assist  financially  troubled  banks with  large  agricultural  loan  portfolios.  Our farm economy is in trouble. For  1984,  farmland value has declined 5  percent, marking the fourth consecu tive year that the real value of farm land has fallen. At the same time after  adjusting for inflation net cash income  for 1984 could be down by more than  25 percent. To make matters worse,  farm production expenses are forecast  to rise 6  to 8 percent and cash ex penses are expected to rise by 8 to 10  percent.  It is no wonder then, that when the  Independent Bankers surveyed  their  membership among the mostly rural  banks, the lenders expect that about  17 percent of their present farm bor rowers will not be able to meet all of  their loan obligations in 1984.  It is now crucial that the Congress  act to include not only thrifts but also  those ailing rural commercial banks in  the net worth  assistance  program.  While the thrifts were and are still in  sad straits due to their mortgage lend ing activities, so are those commercial  banks which service primarily agricul tural communities. This amendment  would add a measure of capital ade quacy which permits  troubled com mercial banks to participate in the net  worth assistance program and would  expand the  test for assistance from  just  those  depository  institutions  which are in financial trouble due to a  commitment  to  residential  housing  lending to include those with a com mitment to agricultural loans.  It is clear,  the economic situation  confronting  American  agriculture  today is worse than the condition ex perienced  by  the  housing  finance  market when the net worth assistance  program was enacted.  The  adoption of  this amendment  will provide a means, through FDIC,  for banks and thrifts that service agri cultural communities to have time to  handle  these  farm  credit problems  without having to foreclose on farmers  or risk their own institutions' failure.

293,Senate,98,-0.435,451,18,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr. President, at a  time when education in our country is  the focus of so much attention, it is  my great pleasure  to commemorate  the 100th anniversary of the founding  of the Bryn Mawr School, one of the  Nation's first independent college pre paratory schools for girls.  Sharing the revolutionary idea that  girls were entitled to the same oppor tunity as boys for a challenging college  prep  education,  five  visionary  women-Martha Carey Thomas, Mary  Elizabeth Garrett, Mamie Gwinn, Eliz abeth Tabor King, and Julia Rebecca  Rodgers-established this outstanding  institution and opened  its doors on  September 21, 1885, in Baltimore, MD.  The curriculum, which  included sci ence and mathematics as well as the  classics, raised the eyebrows of Balti more parents as did a strenuous ath letic  program,  producing  the  first  women's lacrosse team in the country.  This group of young pioneers also  made possible  the existence of  the  Johns Hopkins Medical School,  for  which they raised the necessary funds  but turned them over only when the  trustees had agreed to admit women  on the same terms as men.  The leading efforts of Bryn Mawr's  founders were complemented by the  humanistic and classical spirit of the  school's  first  headmistress,  Edith  Hamilton, world renowned author of  ""The Greek Way,"" whose quarter cen tury at the school confirmed these tra ditions there. As one whose immigrant  parents taught me the importance of  these traditions, I share Miss Hamil ton's philosophy which is still reflect ed today at Bryn Mawr. Through its  programs, it fosters the development  of the intellect, appreciates the diver sity in individuals, and stresses the im portance of physical and moral well being. Miss Hamilton's vision of civili zation as ""a matter of delight in the  things of  the mind"" and her belief  that ""genuine  education  is possible  only when people realize that it has to  do with persons and not movements""  are truly being realized today at this  school.  Under  the  leadership of Headmis tress Barbara Landis Chase and her  outstanding faculty,  the Bryn Mawr  School can boast a  first-rate educa tional curriculum in addition to an ex ceptionally broad program of extra curricular activities. Bryn Mawr can  be very proud of  its alumnae, who  have distinguished themselves in the  field of arts, education, science, sports,  and politics.  This distinguished school has taken  a leadership role not just locally, but  nationally in the educational commu nity. As a  logical extension of Bryn  Mawr's encouragement of career-ori ented young women, it provides an ac credited nursery program, which has  been so successful that the school will  be developing and administering one  like it on the campus of Goucher Col lege. Bryn Mawr's foreign  language  program, which begins  in kindergar ten, was cited by President Carter's  Commission on Foreign Language and  International Study. A computer edu cation program, which also begins in  kindergarten, has served as a model  for many other schools. Two related  efforts-the ""math mentor"" program  and  ""summer  tech""-have  received  similar recognition for  their  innova tiveness in encouraging girls in math  and computer fields.  Bryn Mawr's reputation not only  stands on its high academic standards  and its leadership role in education for  women, but also on its economic, racial  and religious diversity, and its commit ment to community spirit and service.  The school reaches out to all income  levels in Baltimore through a growing  financial aid program and exposes stu dents to a variety of religious beliefs  and customs. Using Baltimore as  its  learning laboratory, the upper school  requires students to participate in the  city program, which introduces them  to urban problems and emphasizes the  importance of community service and  involvement.  It has always been my firm convic tion that there is no greater endeavor  than the training and education of our  Nation's young people. Offering the  opportunity for a complete education  and developing the potential for suc cess in this increasingly complex and  technical world, are among the most  important challenges facing our socie ty today. Through its principles and  programs, Bryn Mawr has been and  continues to be successful in preparing  its students to accept the full responsi bility of self-reliant adults who will be  called upon to lend a hand in keeping  our society on an even keel. Bryn  Mawr provides an excellent environ ment that helps girls develop into the  kinds of patient, hard-working, and  committed individuals so necessary to  keep the democratic process alive, but  most of all a willingness  to get  in volved  in the problems of their day  and to participate in their solution.  Most  recently,  the  Bryn Mawr  School was named one of 60 ""Exem plary Private Schools"" by the Council  for the Advancement of Private Edu cation and  the U.S. Department of  Education, on the basis of intellectual  growth and on efforts  to achieve a  multiracial, multicultural community  and to instill an ideal of service.  I am pleased to call the Senate's at tention to this celebration and ask my  colleagues to join in saluting the suc cess of the Bryn Mawr School, which,  for 100 years, has exemplified the best  of education and has succeeded in edu cating  thoughtful,  responsible,  and  productive individuals who continue to  form an enlightened and  intelligent  citizenry.  I ask that an editorial from the Bal timore Sun be reprinted in the REcoRD  at this point.  The editorial follows:  [From the Baltimore Sun, May 21, 19841  BRYN MAWR  Bryn Mawr  in North Baltimore has of fered the highest-quality college-preparato ry education to girls since 1885, when that  was a very adventurous concept, initiated in  part  to  feed highest-quality graduates  to  ",1984
294,House,98,-0.269,490,18,Mr. ANDERSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in strong support of the confer ence report for H.R. 5798, the Treas ury, Postal Service, and general Gov ernment appropriations bill for fiscal  year 1985.  At the outset, I would like to con gratulate my good friend from south em California,  the chairman of the  subcommittee, En RoYBAL,  and  the  ranking minority member of the sub committee, CLARENcE MILLER, on craft ing another fine bill. Commendations  are also, of course, in order for Chair man JAMIE WHITTEN and the ranking  minority member of the full commit tee, SIL CoNTE.  Of particular interest to me is lan guage in title IV of the report relating  to the construction of a new, 187,000  occupiable square foot office building  in Long Beach, CA. Specifically, $20  million is provided to begin construc tion next year on this badly needed fa cility.  So that my colleagues may have a  better idea why this facility is needed,  some background on the project might  be useful.  The construction of a new Federal  building in Long Beach is one which I  have envisioned since local civic lead ers  initiated a downtown  redevelop ment plan in 1975.  It wasn't until about 3 years ago,  however,  that  I  formally charted a  plan of action to get this project off  the ground. At that time, the Commit tee on Public Works and Transporta tion was considering numerous Feder al office space lease extensions, or pro spectuses, at various cities across the  country. One of these cities happened  to be Long Beach.  Upon careful review of the material  which was submitted to the committee  for approval, I was shocked to find out  that the Federal Government wanted  to spend nearly $70 million over the  next 30 years  to simply rent office  space in Long Beach. At my request,  the  committee  postponed  further  action on this matter pending a more  thorough  examination of  the past,  present, and projected space needs of  the  Federal Government  in Long  Beach.  In July 1982, the Subcommittee on  Public Buildings and Grounds held a  field hearing in Long Beach to study  the space needs of the Federal Gov ernment in this area and to hear from  local community leaders on whether  or not it would be more cost efficient  to build a new Federal facility rather  than continue leasing space.  Not only did Long Beach leaders tes tify in support of moving forward with  construction but, also, officials from  the General Services Administration  [GSAl, who are, of course, in charge  of all real estate transactions for the  Federal Government.  Later that same month, the House,  at my urging, authorized the construc tion  of  a  new  105,000  occupiable  square  foot,  $21.7 million,  Federal  building in Long Beach. As compared  to  rent extensions previously under  consideration,  we  could  save  the  Treasury roughly $50 million over the  next 30 years by constructing a new  facility rather than continuing leasing  space. And, there is little doubt that  this building would be in use well past  this 30-year period.  The saga of the Long Beach Federal  building does not end here, however.  GSA came back to me in 1983 and said  that they had reexamined the project ed growth in the Long Beach area and,  in order to accommodate this growth,  we needed to nearly double the size of  the Long Beach building. Today, this  facility  is  authorized  to  contain  187,000 occupiable square feet and is  slated to cost $41.1 million. I was told  recently  that because more Federal  agencies want to be relocated to this  larger facility, the net savings to the  Federal Government over the next 30  years will be roughly $73 million-as  compared to the earlier figure of $50  million when the Long Beach building  was first authorized.  To date,  the President has signed  into  law,  legislation which appropri ated $6.2 million for site acquisition  and design of the Long Beach build ing. The site selected and approved is  within the new World Trade Center  complex. With regard to design, GSA  has already announced that this facili ty will be the first Federal building in  the Nation to incorporate, at one loca tion, many high-tech features. Some  of these features include passive solar  systems, high-strength concrete, state of-the-art communications, and para bolic lighting. Also,  the Long Beach  building, will be,  in a sense, a  living  structure whose walls will be able to  expand and contract to better accom modate future tenants and their spe cial needs in the years ahead.  In a nutshell, a new Federal office  building in Long Beach will not only  save the Treasury quite a bit of reve nue but, also, better serve those who  must conduct business with the Feder al Government. Currently, Federal of fices are scattered at various locations  across Long Beach and the surround ing area. With the House's approval  today, we can consolidate these func tions which will save us literally mil lions of hard-earned taxpayer dollars  and better serve the residents of Long  Beach and the immediate vicinity.  I urge all of my colleagues to sup port this legislation.   ",1984
295,House,98,-0.27,529,18,Mr. LEHMAN of California.," I thank  the gentleman.  Furthermore, it is my view, that has  been substantiated by a congressional  research  service  legal  opinion  that  with or without enactment of H.R.  1437, new congressional authorization  would be required to increase the size  of O'Shaugnessy Dam or related facili ties.  Mr. Speaker, I am including the fol lowing information for the benefit of  my colleagues:  CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE,  THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS,  .  Washington, DC, Dec. 19, 1983.  To: Honorable Richard Lehman.  From: American Law Division.  Subject: The Hetch Hetchy Water Project.  By  the ""Raker Act"" of 1913,1 Congress  granted the City and County of San Fran cisco, subject to express conditions, certain  lands and rights-of-way in Yosemite Nation al Park and the Stanislaus National Forest.  The legislation was intended to assist the  City  in  constructing  and maintaining  a  means of supplying water for the domestic  purposes of the City of San Francisco and  other public bodies and included an electric  power facility. You have informed us that a  study has recommended that the height of  the O'Shaughnessy Dam that was built as  part of the Hetch Hetchy Project and is lo cated  in Yosemite National Park, be  in creased in order to expand the reservoir ca pacity and supply additional water to San  Francisco. You have asked us if the dam can  be raised under the existing authority, or  whether new authority is needed.  Section 9(k) of the 1913 Act states: ""That  when the said grantee begins the develop ment of the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir site, it  shall undertake and vigorously prosecute to  completion a dam at least two hundred feet  high, with a foundation capable to support ing said dam when built to its greatest eco nomic and safe height.""  This language might be interpreted as an  indication that Congress contemplated that  the dam might be  raised  in  the  future.  Other parts of the act, however, emphasize  that  the  project was  to  be  completed  promptly, and do not speak in terms of ex pansion. See, e.g., section 2, which speaks of  the filing within three years of maps show ing the extent of the facilities  to be con structed, and section 5 which states that the  ""construction of the aforesaid works shall  be prosecuted diligently, and no cessation of  such  construction  shall  continue  for  a  period of three consecutive years,"" and au thorizes a  forfeiture of  the rights of the  grantee for failure to diligently construct. It  appears from these portions of the statute  that Congress intended the project to be a  coherent whole that was  within a few years after enactment.  The principal committee report confirms  that the project was to be promptly con structed and that its features were not seen  as openended or expandable. The House  Report,2  a copy of which is attached, ex plains the project at length. <The Senate  Report 3  is only one page long and cross ref erences  the House Report>. Reference  is  made to a report of the Corps of Engineers  that indicate that the maximum height of  the dam could be 325 feet. 4 The Committee  analysis of the bill explains section 9(k) on  to be completed  Footnotes at end of letter.  the dam height: Paragraph (k), section 9 re quires San Francisco to build a dam at l~ast  200 feet high.  (This means  that  the city will expend  from $500,000 to $1,000,000 in excess of ini tial expenditures necessary for its immedi ate need. The intent is to build the dam  high enough to provide adequate storage to  mee~ the conditions of the grant, and is pri marily a benefit for the irrigationists.) 11  Given the fact that the dam was to be  bull~ at nonfederal expense, the language of  sect1on 9(k) therefore appears merely to es tablish a minimum height to insure that the  project was worthwhile, but also gives the  nonfederal builders flexibility to decide how  much storage was desired and how much  money to spend. The balance of the lan guage may merely have been meant  to  impose good workmanship requirements of  the kind contained elsewhere in the bill. s  Section 1 of the Act  indicates that the  purpose of the grants is the development of  a water supply and delivery system for ""con veying water for domestic purposes and uses  to the city and county of San Francisco and  such other municipalities and water dis tricts as, with the consent of the city and  county of San Francisco, or in accordance  with the laws of the State of California in  force at the time application is made, may  hereafter participate in the beneficial use of  the rights and privileges granted by  this  Act."" This language as to other cities is re peated in the section 8 definition of ""grant ee"". Therefore, it could be argued that the  dam could be raised in order to provide addi tional cities with water as they later partici pate in the benefits of the Act.  Again, however,  the statute as a whole  seems to contemplate the project as a com pleted whole and that these possible future  needs of other towns in the San Francisco  area would be reflected in the dam height  and storage capacity San Francisco chose.  The scope and purposes of a project are of  central importance in analyzing the extent  to which a federal constructing agency such  as the Army Corps of Engineers may exer cise discretion to modify a project:  The 1951 Chief of Engineers' report made  a comprehensive review of the scope of ex ecutive authority to modify projects previ ously approved by Congress, setting forth  general principles as follows:  The Corps of Engineers  recognize  that  this latitude for changes and modifications  of authorized projects represents an impor tant delegation of authority, and the Corps  has attempted  to exercise  that authority  carefully. In general, the Corps of Engineers  considers that there are two types of modifi cations:  a. Modifications and changes of a project  which are necessary for engineering or con struction reasons to produce the degree and  extent of flood protection or the extent of  navigation  improvement intended by Con gress are within the latitude delegated to  the Corps of Engineers. Examples of such  changes are shift of a dam  to a nearby  better location; provision of a greater stor age capacity  required by more complete  flood records; shifts in alinement of chan nels indicated by more detailed surveys; or  changes from a concrete to an earth struc ture because of lack of proper concrete ag gregate. These may be considered generally  as engineering modifications.  b. Moderate extensions of project scope  such as those required to provide flood pro tection to adjacent urban areas which have  developed since the project was authorized  or to provide better channel alinement o;  larger navigation locks to meet the needs of  developing commerce. It would obviously be  uneconomical and contrary to the intent of  Congr~ss to construct obsolete projects, or  to om1t flood protection for a part of a city  when it was the intent of Congress to au thorize flood protection for that city. These  may be  considered  generally  as  project  modifications necessary  to meet changed  physical and economic conditions.            On the other hand, the Corps of Engi neers has considered that it does not have  latitude to make modifications which mate rially extend the scope and change the func tions of the project authorized by Congress.  It considers that it is necessary to bring a  proposed modification  of  an  authorized  project to the attention of Congress if fur ther study after authorization shows that:  a. The scope or functions of the project  will be materially changed thereby.  b. The plan of improvement will be mate ~ially changed from that originally author tzed by Congress.  c. There are special circumstances which  were not known to the Corps of Engineers  or recognized by Congress when the project  was authorized.  N~ hard-and-fast rule can be cited as gov errung when a project modification should  be presented to Congress for further consid eration.  Increased cost over  the estimate  presented to Congress as a basis for authori z~tion is not necessarily a governing crite non, as the major factors giving rise to in creased costs are separate and apart from  the intent of Congress in authorizing an im provement, and as the Appropriations Com mittee  of Congress  are  advised  of  cost  changes year by year. 7  Increasing the height of this dam might  well be beyond the authorization in this in stance even for  federal construction as a  modification that would materially change  the scope of the project in response to cir cumstances that Congress clearly was aware  of in the first authorization. Congress gave  San Francisco the opportunity to determine  in the project planning how much storage  capacity to build. Also,  in the years since  the completion of the project, there has de veloped increased recognition of the conser vation values of National Parks and of envi ronmental concerns in general. This devel opment  lends credence  to  the argument  that enlarging the dam and reservoir consti tutes  a  significant modification  of  the  project for which new authority is needed.  Furthermore, the dam actually was con structed by nonfederal entities. To increase  the dam and hence  its storage capacity  would, of course, raise the level of the water  in  the  reservoir,  thereby submerging  the  surrounding  lands. The documentation of  the 1913 Act indicates that much of this  land_ is federal and is within a national park.  Sect10n 9<t> of the Act required the grantee  to convey to the United States title to any  and all tracts of land then owned by the  grantee within Yosemite and the part of the  national forest adjacent thereto. Therefore  the lands that would be submerged appear  to be federal, and they could not be sub merged and  their value  impaired or de stroyed without  the consent of Congress.  Congress is granted the authority to dispose  of federal property under Art.

That is the essence of inhumanity.  For far  too  long,  this Nation has  treated the Armenian people with that  brutal detachment. By refusing to offi cially  condemn  and  commemorate  Turkey's systematic murder of the Ar menian people in the early part of this  century, we demonstrated a  tremen dous disregard for history and a tragic  disrespect for human dignity.  The House took an important step in  redressing  that wrong  last Monday  when we passed House Joint Resolu tion 247, which designates a ""National  Day of Remembrance of Man's Inhu manity to Man."" This resolution reaf firms our traditional commitment to  defending the rights of all people ev erywhere.

During  the last 15 years,  this program has  grown in size and stature, and it has  earned the respect of the entire com munity for the caliber of its programs  and its graduates.  The Leadership St. Pete program at tempts to identify young professionals  and challenges those selected to look  deeply at the decisionmaking process es of the city, State, and our Nation.  The seminars provide class members  an opportunity to meet with communi ty leaders as well as State and Federal  officials, and these discussions provide  opportunities  for  the members not  only to understand probleins better,  but also work on the development of  their leadership skills and to establish  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  vital networks which help them better  serve our community.

310,,98,0.098,581,18,Mr. DAVIS.," Mr. Speaker, I am in troducing a bill today that will clarify  the logbook requirements for vessels  on the Great Lakes that sail to Cana dian ports.  Under prior law-former 46 U.S.C.  544-these  vessels  on  a  voyage  to  Canada were not required to maintain  logbooks. However, in the codification  of the shipping laws in title 46 of the  United States Code this provision was  inadvertently  omitted. Thus,  under  section 11301(a) vessels of the United  States sailing between a port in the  United States and a port in a foreign  country are required to have an offi cial logbook with specific types of en tries that must be made. The reason  for a logbook is to ensure that seamen  on board vessels  that go  to foreign  ports  are  afforded  the  appropriate  protection and relief under U.S.  law.  However,  in the prior law the policy  was  that these protections were not  necessary for voyages to Canada be cause of the close proximity of these  ports. Other similar provisions regard ing the seamen's welfare laws also con tain  an  exemption  for  voyages  to  Canada and other nearby ports for  this reason.  The bill  I  am  introducing  today  would simply restore this provision so  that vessels sailing to Canada would  not merely have to begin to set up the  paperwork to comply with logbook re quirements because of an oversight in  the codification of  title 46, United  States Code. Thus, from a historical  and legal perspective, this provision in  no way diminishes the protection af forded  our American  seamen  and  serves to eliminate this ambiguity in  our shipping laws.e  THE QUALITY WORK FORCE AT  GENERAL  MOTORS'  DELCO  ELECTRONICS  MILWAUKEE  PLANT  HON. GERALD D. KLECZKA  OF WISCONSIN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 12, 1984  e Mr. K.LECZKA. Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to bring to my colleagues  ",1984
311,,98,-0.306,594,18,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker. while I  generally support the goals of H.R.  4277. the Natural Gas Market Polley  Act of 1984,  I am greatly disturbed  with the anticonsumer section 601 of  the bill which would repeal title II of  the Powerplant and  Industrial Fuel  Use Act of 1978.  This title of the Fuel Use Act pro hibits the construction of new natural  gas electric utility boilers.  It is my belief that we must give pri ority to residential and industrial uses  of natural gas as opposed to allowing  this valuable energy resource  to be  used by new electric utilities  as  a  boiler fuel for the purpose of generat ing electricity. This belief is reinforced  by  the  fact  that every estimate of  future domestic natural gas produc tion does not indicate there will be a  dramatic increase in our natural gas  resource base.  In light of the great uncertainties  surrounding future natural gas avail ability, prudence dictates that title II  of  the Fuel Use Act be  retained.  Indeed,  the proposed elimination of  title II raises the specter of the Nation  revisiting the natural gas shortages ex perienced during the winter of 1976-77  when  factories  and  schools  closed  Ironically, this was the very situation  which led to enactment of the NGPA  and the Fuel Use Act in the first place.  As such, if section 601 of H.R. 4277 is  passed by  the Congress,  residential  and  industrial users of natural gas  may find that at some point in the  future  their gas supplies have been  curtailed because of new electric utility demand for those very same sup plies.  Another reason why I oppose  the  repeal of title II of the Fuels Use Act  is that due to Federal wellhead price  controls on natural gas-continued for  the most part by H.R. 4277-natural  gas if allowed to be used in new elec tric  utility  boilers would  have  an  unfair advantage over other fuels such  as coal.  In such an environment, the Federal  Government would be promoting utili ty use of natural gas through these  price controls. This  is certainly an  unfair energy policy and there can be  no doubt that it would reduce future  coal demand.  The sponsors of H.R. 4277 should be  placed on notice that if section 601 is  retained, it will have a far-reaching ad verse  impact on employment in the  Nation's coalfields.  For these reasons,  if H.R. 4277  is  brought to the House floor. I will offer  ",1984
312,House,98,0.278,607,18,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in  support of the conference report on S.  2463, which establishes the ocean and  coastal resources management and de. velopment  fund  from which  block  grants will be made to coastal States  and territories, and which authorizes  appropriations  for  several National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  programs  and deep seabed mining.  The conference report before us is  the result of OCS revenue sharing leg islation, developed and introduced by  our chairman during the 1st session of  the 97th Congress. I will neither at tempt to detail the many hearings and  negotiating sessions conducted by our  committee, nor discuss the many revi sions this legislation has gone through  over  the 3-year period  in order  to  reach the consensus before us today.  However, I do want to point out some  of the more important aspects of this  bill to my colleagues.  First, this bill would establish a fund  into which deposits equal to 4 percent  of average OCS oil and gas receipts  would be made, and from which States  would receive block grants for the pur their ocean and  coastal  resources. As we  all know,  Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas  development has not always been a  popular issue in coastal States because  of their limited ability to plan for and  accommodate offshore  leasing,  even  though such leasing will result in this  Nation's energy independence.  Mr. Speaker, may I say for those of  us who hear about the dependency on  foreign countries for our oil supply,  this bill will solve that dependence and  make us indendent of the foreign oil  which we import today.  pose of managing  Although  the OCS  now  provides  about 9 percent of  the Nation's oil  supply, it is estimated that up to 60  percent of this Nation's remaining un produced oil  is  located on the OCS.  Yet only 2 percent of  the Federal  lands offshore are under lease and we  are depending on foreign sources for  over 30 percent of our crude oil-a not too-stable supply, I might add, if my  colleagues will look at what has hap pened  in  the  straits  overseas. Al though we have barely  tapped our  OCS oil and gas resources, we cannot  expect  to  carry  out  any  positive  energy plan offshore without the co operation of coastal States and com munities. They are expected to bear  the burden of the social, environmen tal, and economic impacts which may  result  from  such offshore develop ment. Without the financial resources  to carry out coastal planning and to  address impacts associated with OCS  activities, they often feel they are left  with one alternative-to oppose all off shore development so these problems  will never arise.  This bill will once again give coastal  States the incentive to support OCS  development and promote our energy  independence by providing them with  block grants for the express purpose  of  enhancing  and managing  their  coastal resources and alleviating any  adverse  impacts  that  result  from  energy-related activities.  An even more important aspect of  this bill is that each State receiving a  block grant must provide one-third of  such allocation  to  its  local govern ments to carry out their responsibil ities under the act. It is usually the  local  communities which  bear  the  greatest burden from offshore and on shore energy activities, not the States,  and I believe it is essential that local  communities  have  the  funds  they  need.  Mr. Speaker, I think the enactment  of this legislation will result  in the  Federal-state partnerships, the Good  Neighbor policy promoted by this ad ministration, necessary  to carry out  our energy independence goals while  protecting State and  local  interests,  and may I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that  the chairman of the committee, the  gentleman from North Carolina, made  a proper statement. There are those  who are opposed to this legislation in  the administration. The administra tion and I  respectfully disagree. We  have  been  impeded,  but not  only  during this administration, by actions  of coastal States because  they have  nothing to gain by Federal offshore  development when there is no sharing  of the revenues. If we want to be inde pendent, if we want the oil for the  American people to develop our econo my, if we want to be able to direct our  own destiny,  then this bill must be  passed. It already passed this House  once by a vote of 301 to 93, I believe,  and the last time ft passed, it passed  by a voice vote.  I urge my colleagues to support this  conference  report  that was  signed  unanimously by the Senators and by  the House Members of the conference.

314,House,98,0.336,633,18,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Chairman, I  yield myself such time as I may con sume.  Mr. Chairman, I suppose I  should  set the record straight on a couple of  things first. First, how we got this out  of committee.  I  think it is only fair to say that  since we are a 2-to-1-plus-1 minority,  the only attempt we have  to slow  things down is to not give a quorum  and that particular day we made sure  that we did not give them a quorum  and when we thought they were fin ished, one of my colleagues walked out  to pick up his books and the chairman  said now we have a quorum and we  had a quorum, and that is how this  bill came out of committee.  Second,  I  think in fairness  to the  Senate, I should respond to something  that one of the gentlemen on my side  of the aisle said, he was blaming waste  for not closing defense installations on  the Senate.  I will guarantee you, you would not  find any congresspersons in the House  of Representatives who will stand still  anytime they try to close one, and I  have been guilty of that, also. I think  we should be fair  to our colleagues  over on the Senate side.  Then I think I should also caution  those who were looking our way all  the time in relationship to what hap pened in 1981. I believe that, and that  I am not patting myself too much on  the back when I say that I had a lot to  do with not having some  things go  into a block grant.  A  lot to do with not reducing ex penditures as they were proposed in  the area of education.  In fact, all of the time we have in creased  those  expenditures  I  think  with 1 year where we stayed pretty  much the same.  But let me  talk a  little bit about  what is happening today. To me this is  probably one of the most depressing  experiences that I have had in the  Congress of the United States. I say  that primarily because I do not think  there  is anyone that has spent any  more time trying to help children, any  more time trying to provide leadership  in the area of education as  I have  during the 23 years I was in education  and since I have come to the Congress  of the United States.  And so my fear is, and the reason I  am depressed is that I am afraid we  are playing politics  today and I am  afraid we  are playing politics  and  using children, and that is depressing  tome.  First of all, when the outside spon sors of the bill spoke with me about  this bill coming to the floor, my first  question was,  is the Senate going to  act on this legislation this year and  they said, no, the best we can hope for  is that they might have a few hearings  at which point I said, then should not  we be doing something to help chil dren  this  year  before  an  election  rather  than  doing  something  that  would appear to the public as being  strictly political.  The response was that they thought,  first of all,  that if we move  in the  House perhaps things would go more  quickly next year at which point I  said, you know the political reality, as  I see it, if the incumbent is reelected, I  do not believe there will be a new $9  billion program over a 3-year period  initiated next year and if the challeng er is successful he has already indicat ed that it will be pay-as-you-go.  Now, I do not fault any of my col leagues  for whatever  philosophical  bent they may have because I believe  they are sincere. Whether  it  is big  spenders as I heard someone mention.  Whether it is  liberal or whatever it  may be, I believe they are sincere.  I lose a little respect, though, when I  hear the number of 1 minute speeches  that are given  every day  including  some of them that were given today  that really made me bite my tongue  about what we should do about defi cits and who is responsible for deficits,  et cetera. I think we should be consist ent.  I also ask as we are moving the bill  through committee, why now? Why  did this bill not come at the beginning  of  this session when everybody had  education  foremost  in  their mind;  when we would have had a beautiful  mechanism around which we  could  have built a comprehensive program  to respond to the problems that have  been brought forth through A Nation  at Risk and many of the other studies,  some of which were much better.  We would have had a golden oppor tunity instead of the piecemeal effort  that has gone forth, we would have  had a golden opportunity to bring a  comprehensive bill to the floor of the  House.  The response was that, well, we did  not want to interfere with reauthor ization of  the vocational  education  bill.  I will guarantee  you  as  long  as  Chairman Perkins was in this House  of Representatives, no one, no one was  ever going to interfere with the reau thorization of  the vocational education bill and  therefore  I  could not  accept that response from the same  people who gave me  the other  re sponse.  This bill should have come at the be ginning of the session. So, as I said, we  could have built a comprehensive pro gram. Now we have passed a math and  science bill, $1 billion over 2 years  which, incidentally, has a waiver provi sion for foreign language.  We passed and it has been signed, an  excellence in education bill, $50 mil lion over a 3-year period.  Over on our side we increased chap ter II by $200 million. We passed a for eign language bill on our side, $50 mil lion for a year. We reauthorized H.R.  11, $7 billion over a 5-year period. We  had a golden opportunity, as I said, to  build  a  comprehensive  program  to  attack the problems that are facing us  in public education.  Now, let me talk just briefly about  what I believe is the Federal role in  public education.  I feel very strongly that we do have  a role. We have a major role and that  major role is to have equal access for  all children for a good education, no  matter who they are or where they  live. That is why, as a matter of fact, I  have been a strong supporter of Head  Start, a program that is working and  working well. It got off to a bad start,  but is now working well.  That is why I have been a strong  supporter of title I and then chapter I.  And, as a matter of fact, as the amend ment that I will offer will indicate, as I  told the group who visited me in my  office, this would have been a golden  opportunity before an election to do  something  about  the  hundreds  of  thousands of dropouts that we have in  this country and will continue to have  unless we find a solution to that prob lem.  And that would not be an easy solu tion. The bill that we are considering  today will not be a short-term answer  by a  long shot to that solution. The  short-term answer, it seems to me, to  do something about the dropout prob lem is to extend that very successful  program that we have in chapter 1 so  that it can include secondary young sters. It can include secondary young sters now but to financially support  that program. It has been in operation  20 years and the best statistics that I  can find would indicate that we are  now  probably  serving  somewhere  around 48 to 50 percent of all of the  eligible youngsters. Twenty years  to  get to that point.  Now, you see, that brings me to one  of the real problems with the piece of  legislation  that we  have before us  today and that is the funding formula,  if it is not fully funded.  Let us say that it takes 20 years to  fully  fund  this piece of  legislation  then all you are doing is dribbling a  ",1984
315,House,98,-0.496,646,18,Mr. SEIBERLING.," Mr. Speaker, for  4 years, we have listened to President  Reagan promise a  balanced budget,  while all the time he has been going in  just the opposite direction and piling  up the greatest deficits in our Nation's  history.  The President has had four opportu nities to submit balanced budgets to  the Congress, yet each year's budget  has produced a larger deficit than the  year before.  On this record, what are the Ameri can people supposed to think of the  President's continued pleas for a con stitutional amendment to require en actment  of  balanced  budgets-not  now, of course, but some day in the  future after he is no longer President?  I am reluctant to think that Presi dent Reagan is stringing us along. Yet  he must know that the deficit problem  has to be faced next year, not at some  remote  future  time. He must know  that means cutting spending and rais ing  taxes. Surely  the voters have a  right to be informed, before the elec tion,  whose  programs  President  Reagan proposes  to cut and whose  taxes he proposes to raise.  Mr. Mondale has  told us how he  plans to tackle the deficit problem. It  is time Mr. Reagan leveled with the  American people as to how he plans to  do it.  In the words of conservative colum nist James J. Kilpatrick, ""Something  has to be done about our deficits, but  an  unenforceable,  unintelligible  amendment  to  the Constitution will  get us nowhere at all.""  The  full  text of Mr. Kilpatrick's  column  as  printed  in  the Akron  Beacon Journal for August 22, 1984,  follows these remarks.  AN AMENDMENT ISN'T THE WAY TO BALANCE  BUDGET  (By James J. Kilpatrick>  WASHINGTON.-Comma or no comma, on  the matter of an increase in taxes the Re publican Party platform is positively ambig uous or ambiguously positive,  take your  choice. One  is  reminded of the little old  Episcopal  lady who  loved her  toddy; she  made a  firm pledge that during Lent she  would not have a drink unless she really  needed one.  But on one  issue  in public finance  the  platform is indeed unequivocal: The Repub lican Party wants a constitutional amend ment to compel the adoption of balanced  budgets.  On this proposition,  if I may state the  matter mildly,  the Republican Party has  lost its collective mind.  It is a curious thing about Republicans about some Republicans, anyhow. They like  to think of themselves as ""conservatives,""  but they are obsessed with tinkering with  the Constitution. They are forever natter ing on about an amendment  to prohibit  abortion, or an  amendment  to prohibit  racial balance busing, or an amendment to  guarantee the right of the people voluntari ly to join in prayer in public buildings.  The President's favorite amendment is the  balanced budget amendment. It is a turkey  if there ever was one.  Oh, the basic idea is generally sound. In  principle,  the  government  in  peacetime  should match outgo to income. ""Pay as we  go!"" cried John Randolph of Roanoke a  long time ago. It sounds great. But in actual  practice the basic idea gets caught in the re fusal of Congress to separate an operating  budget from a capital budget.  Yes, operating expenses, such as the pay  of meat inspectors and the purchase of pa perclips, ideally should be met from current  income. But capital expenses, such as the  construction of a federal building or an air craft carrier, properly may be funded by  borrowing. The President's pet amendment  takes no account of these considerations.  Over the past 15 or 20 years, since talk of  a balanced budget amendment became fash ionable, at least 15 or 20 drafts of such a  resolution have been offered on Capitol  ",1984

317,Senate,98,-0.163,711,18,Mr. BENTSEN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to join with my distinguished  colleague,  the  senior Senator  from  Texas [Mr. TowER],  in proposing an  amendment to correct a substantial in equity with  some  savings and  loan  shareholders  at  the Federal Home  Loan Bank Board.  Although this amendment is techni cally not germane under the rules of  cloture, it is a needed amendment.  I object most strongly  to Govern ment actions which abrogate private  contracts, and that is what the Feder al Home Loan Bank Board has done  with their August 2, 1984, final rule re garding conversion  from mutual  to  stock ownership by savings and loans.  One part of that rule retroactively  extends from 1 to 3 years the limita tion on takeovers. I believe that this  portion of the rule should be rescind ed.  The sanctity of private contracts is a  basic principal of our legal system. In  this case, conversions from mutual to  stock form which took place between  February 29, 1983, and February 23,  1984, were done under rules which lim ited takeovers for 1 year. This 1-year  limitation was clearly stated  in  the  prospectus  for  each of  these  stock  sales. The holders of the institutions  made the decision to convert knowing  that there would be a 1-year limit on  takeovers, and investors bought stock  on the strength of this assurance. The  action of  the Federal Home Loan  Bank Board in retroactively changing  this rule is unfair and has caused sub stantial  losses  to all stockholders  in  these institutions by causing immedi ate decreases  in  the price of  their  stock.  I am aware that there are arguments  on both sides of the question of take over restrictions. However, those argu ments are superseded in this case by  what I believe to be a basic and over-  riding principle of law. Severe finan cial harm has been done to the stock holders of  those  savings and  loans  which converted under the 1-year rule,  and simple justice demands that this  inequity be remedied as soon as possi ble.  Objecting  to  the consideration of  this amendment as part of this bill ob viously will  not  kill  our  proposal.  There will be other vehicles to which  this amendment could be offered, al though this is clearly the most appro priate bill for the consideration of this  issue.  Although we have made substantial  efforts during a very  long day,  it is  now apparent that the unanimous con sent that it now required to get this  amendment before the Senate will not  be forthcoming. However, I think that  there  is  substantial support  in  the  Senate for this proposal, and I intend  to work with my distinguished col league from Texas [Mr. TowER] to see  that the Senate has an opportunity to  express its sentiments in opposition to  this Federal Home Loan Bank Board  rule.  CLARIFICATION OF BANKING BILL: GLASSSTEAGALL SECTION   ",1984
318,Senate,98,0.263,711,18,Mr. TRIBLE.," Mr.  President,  in  taking action on the Senate banking  bill, S. 2851-the Financial Services  Competitive Equity Act, Glass-Stea gall prohibitions are applied for  the  first  time  to  thrift institution affili ations in section 112.  I question the  need for such an extension, particular ly in light of the fact that this issue  was not addressed during any of the  hearings or in the testimony of wit nesses who would be most affected by  the provision.  Therefore, the grandfathering of ex isting  institutions, whose affiliations  but for section 112 were lawful, should  be construed broadly.  In particular, section 112 adds a new  subsection <o> to section 408 of the Na tional Housing Act, making provisions  of sections 20 and 32 of Glass-Steagall  applicable to ""insured institutions"" as  if they were member banks.  Paragraph (2) of the subsection, as  amended by  the managers' amend ment, provides for grandfathering of  affiliations or relationships or the establishment of such officer, director,  or empolyee relationships in connec tion with any affiliation  that com menced prior to June 27, 1984. It is my  understanding  that  the grandfather  provision is not intended to ""freeze""  any company that controlled both an  insured institution and a securities un derwriter on the grandfather date so  that it could not expand those busi nesss through acquisition.  To the contrary, the intent of the  language  is  that  if a company con trolled both an insured institution and  a securities underwriter on the rele vant date,  then  it may continue  to  maintain control over both types of in stitution and may expand either or  both types, through acquisition of new  companies, merger with new compa nies, or internal growth.  In other words, what  is grandfa thered for a company controlling both  types of businesses is the basic affili ation between the two types brought  about by its common control, and not  just the affiliation between particular  subsidiaries as  they existed on  the  grandfather date.  The Senate, in taking action on S.  2851, has incorporated therein these  assumptions.e   ",1984
319,House,98,-0.173,828,18,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise as  a  strong  supporter of  the Marine  Sanctuaries Program. The need for a  functional and effective program is no  less now than it was when Congress  passed the original legislation in 1972.  Indeed, the increase in human activity  in our coastal waters has made this  program even more important by al lowing for the protection of discrete  but significant areas of our coastal  waters. The richness and diversity of  our offshore areas are no less deserv ing of  responsible management and  protection  than our national parks,  wilderness areas, wildlife refuges and  other components of our  treasured  natural heritage.  It is for this reason that I am con cerned by some comments which have  been made on the House floor regard ing the legislative intent behind this  worthwhile  bill.  First,  I  feel  the  Marine Sanctuaries Amendments of  1983 speak eloquently,  in  their own  way, of the purpose intended for this  legislation. Furthermore, members of  both the House and Senate commit tees have worked diligently to clarify  the proposed law in their committee  reports.  It is correctly asserted that the Sec retary of Commerce must, according  to this legislation, determine that pro posed sanctuaries meet five standards  before they are designated. The Secre tary is also requested to consider nine  other factors in reaching his decisions.  Clearly, neither the House Merchant  Marine and Fisheries Committee nor  the  Senate  Commerce  Committee  intend that the standards set by this  bill would be so  restrictive  that no  sanctuaries would be designated. The  purpose of this legislation is to provide  for the conservation and management  of nationally significant marine areas,  not to establish insurmountable hur dles to the designation of marine sanc tuaries.  Another  issue of concern  involves  the size of areas to be designated as  marine  sanctuaries. This  legislation  authorizes the Secretary of Commerce  to ""designate any discrete area of the  marine  environment  as  a  national  marine sanctuary"" and to promulgate  appropriate regulations <sec. 303(a)).  In an earlier colloquy, it was interpret ed  that  discrete  means  ""small.""  Indeed, the true meaning of the word  and the intent in using this term, is  that a designated area be ""individually  distinct"" and easily definable in geo graphic scope and ecological, cultural  or other character. A careful review of  the bill shows clearly that a designat ed area should be limited to a ""size  and nature which will permit compre hensive and coordinated conservation  management"" <sec. 303(a)(3)). This re quirement is a hard and fast standard  that must be met by all designated  sites, and constitutes the only restric tion on the size of sanctuaries desig nated by the Secretary.  In order to make a reasonable deter mination on sanctuary designations,  the Secretary  is  required  to consult  with the House Merchant Marine and  Fisheries Committee  and with  the  Senate Commerce Committee, several  Federal agencies, State and local gov ernments,  the  appropriate Regional  Fishery Management  Council,  and  other interested persons. In no case,  however, is the Secretary required to  secure the approval of these parties-a  point clearly made by the legislation  and both House and Senate reports.  There are, however,  a number of  public and private uses of ocean re sources that could be affected by the  designation of a national marine sanc tuary, including fishing and energy de velopment.  Under  this  legislation,  public and private uses of  the  re sources in a marine sanctuary may be  allowed provided they are ""compatible  with the primary objective of resource  protection"" <sec.  30l<b)(5)). Specific  protection for fisheries <sec. 304 a 3)  and for preexisting leases and permits  <sec. 304(b)(5)) are included in the bill.  Moreover, contrary to the assertions  made in the colloquy, the existing pro tections afforded the marine environ ment by existing statutes are not nec essarily adequate for the proper man agement of valuable resources. A Con gressional Research Service report in  1980 and a 1981 General Accounting  Office  report  indicate  the Marine  Sanctuary Program can provide envi ronmental protection not otherwise  available. This finding is reinforced by  the Merchant Marine and Fisheries  Committee  report <H. Rept. 98-187,  pp. 20-21) which states:  Depending on the location, the resources,  and the existing mechanisms, a sanctuary  could either complement existing mecha nisms by filling specific gaps or could form a  management umbrella over a  fragmented  system to help coordinate diverse but relat ed efforts.  For many  reasons,  our  coastal  waters need careful and  responsible  protection. Their biological productivi ty is far more than a scientific curiosi ty, it is the underpinning of this Na tion's bountiful  fisheries  resources.  Protection of selected areas of our off shore waters is a pressing need in the  face of accelerating coastal develop ment and human activity.  Once again,  I am delighted  to see  this  important  legislation reach  this  stage on its path toward enactment. I  commend my  colleagues  in  both  Houses for their work on this bill.e   ",1984
320,House,98,-0.45,828,18,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of S. 1102, which reau thorizes and amends title III of the  Marine  Protection,  Research,  and  Sanctuaries Act of 1972.  Under  the current administration,  we have seen increased pressure to de velop  our marine  resources, more  often than not, at the expense of our  environment. The marine sanctuaries  program authorized by this bill recog nizes that ""certain areas of the marine  environment possess conservation, rec reational,  ecological,  historical,  re search, educational, or esthetic quali ties which give them special national  significance."" For the purposes of en vironmental protection and preserva tion, our National Marine Sanctuaries  Program identifies areas of the marine  environment of special national sig nificance and provides for the coordi nated conservation and management  of these areas.  The  chairman  of  the Merchant  Marine and Fisheries Committee has  indicated  that  the colloquy entered  into by  the Members managing this  bill on the House floor does not repre sent  the views of  the committee.  I  concur with the chairman.  The meaning  and  intent  of  the  Marine Sanctuaries Amendments of  1984 are amply explained in the House  report <H. Rept. 98-187) and Senate  report <S. Rept. 98-280). As the House  report  clearly  states,  these  amend ments codify the existing administra tion of  the marine sanctuaries pro gram.  As  a member  of  the Merchant  Marine and Fisheries Committee who  participated in the hearings and vote  on H.R. 2062, the companion bill to S.  1102, my understanding of congres sional  intent  in  passing  the  1984  amendments is to grant the Secretary  of Commerce unambiguous authority  to designate areas as marine sanctuar ies and adopt regulations  to protect  the natural resources of these areas.  The bill directs  the Secretary of  Commerce to consult with the House  ",1984

We are fast approaching the point of  no return in the arena of space arms  control. Limiting,  if not eliminating,  the proliferation of weapons in space  will become more not less difficult to  achieve unless we do something soon  to stop it.  Because of my concern, I have con ducted a  series of hearings on  the  matter in my capacity as chairman of  the House Foreign Affairs Subcommit tee on International Security and Sci entific Affairs.

323,,98,-0.44,1075,18,Mr. BEILENSON.," Mr. Speaker,  I  would like to take a moment to draw  my colleagues' attention to the plight  of  long-time  refusenik  Aleksandr  Yakir and  to commend an unprece dented coalition of Jewish leaders and  Christian,  civil  rights,  peace  and  human rights groups for their actions  on Mr. Yakir's behalf.  Aleksandr Yakir  and his parents  have been trying to emigrate from the  Soviet Union since October 1973 and  for  the past 7 years, Aleksandr has  been filing for exit permission on his  own. Aleksandr has been refused per mission on  ""humanitarian grounds""  because the authorities ""do not want  to split up families."" In addition, Alek sandr has been convicted of draft eva sion and now faces up to 3 years of im prisonment: it is ironic that Aleksandr  refused to be inducted into the mili tary because he did not want to be ex posed to ""state secrets,""  thus giving  the Soviets further excuse  to delay  granting him permission to emigrate.  Aleksandr's plight has been given  special  attention by members of  a  unique coalition of leaders who have  recently sent cables to Soviet officials  protesting his arrest, trial, and convic tion on charges of draft evasion. The  group has also urged the Soviet Gov ernment  to grant  the Yakir  family  permission to immigrate to Israel.  I  am glad  that  the coalition has  added some new voices to the cause of  Soviet Jewry, and I urge them, along  with all of us in the U.S. Congress, to  continue speaking out for the rights of  Soviet Jews such as Aleksandr Yakir.e  TRffiUTE TO LINDA THERESA  GARCIA  HON.

But clear ly,  the real solution to the problem  lies  in  the  reduction of production  worldwide. We  have more  supply  today  than we  have  demand  for  copper.  Something must be done  to bring  supply into line with demand. I believe  the negotiations which are called for  in this amendment would accomplish  that.

However, it  is my opinion  that if we open  the  Senate to public viewing, perhaps the  kind of debate we will witness on the  Senate floor will be more meaningful  and perhaps the decorum more along  the lines of what he would hope to see.  In any event, I think television is a  most  important means of  informing  the American people, and I hope that  the Senate will have the good sense to  support the resolution offered by Sen ator Baker and others.  We  are  elected  to  represent  the  people of our State.  I know of no  reason why our service to them should  not be open to the fullest observation  and scrutiny.

Mr. President, every American has  the right to watch us at work and to  hold us accountable for how we repre sent them. Televising Senate debates  enhances these opportunities.  There are many arguments made or  implied that the quality of debate will  be affected by television; that Sena tors will play to the grandstands and  exploit the exposure for personal gain.

328,House,98,-0.438,1205,18,Mr. FORD of Tennessee.," Mr. Speak er, as you know, America's steel indus try has been devastated over the years  by imported steel from countries who  oftentimes subsidize  their  industries,  and who at the same time, impose re strictive import schemes to prevent us  from selling steel in their countries.  On the other hand, nearly 33 per cent of the steel sold in this country in  July was produced overseas. Addition ally,  jobs  in  the steel  industry has  fallen  from  an  average  of  workers between 1975-79  last year-a reduction of 46 percent.  Walter Mondale said in Cleveland,  OH, yesterday that he will cut steel  imports to 17 percent of domestic con sumption for 5 years to give the indus try the opportunity to become more  competitive internationally.  The Reagan administration is toying  with various proposals to cut import  steel  from  percent-it must  reach a decision by September 24.  It is obvious that we, as Members of  Congress,  cannot  stand  back  and  watch the demise of our steel industry.  Nor can we afford  to watch other  countries provide assistance  to their  steel industry in order that they can  453,000  to 243,000  19-21  then sell their steel in our country at a  cheaper price.  Should  the Reagan administration  fail to take adequate action over the  next week, I encourage my colleagues  to support other measures that will  provide much needed assistance to our  steel industry which is so vital to our  national economy.  We can't afford to play politics with  243,000 unemployed workers.

My friend and constituent Joe Kit tinger  is no ordinary man. He  is a  much decorated former military pilot  and prisoner of war in the Vietnam  war. In 1960, Joe set a world record for  free fall when he plunged 16.04 miles  before opening his parachute after  jumping  from  a  balloon at 102,800  feet.

During his Atlantic flight this week  Joe broke both the world class balloon  distance  and  duration  records  and  became the first man to cross the At lantic alone in a balloon.  Joe Kittinger is an American hero.  He follows in the footsteps and tradi tions of great American aviation heros  like Charles Lindbergh and Neil Arm strong.

I am particularly concerned about  one provision of the bill that plainly  requires amendment. That is a provi sion that appears to be aimed at an ap propriate result, but that attempts to  achieve  it in a  totally  inappropriate  way. I am speaking of the provision re quiring  that  sentencing  guidelines  specify sentences that will not result  in prison overcrowding. While over crowding is a serious difficulty, that  approach is the least defensible way to  avoid  it. Any  sentencing guidelines  system should assure that the guide lines are developed with the determi nation of achieving essential public  purposes;  usually,  just punishment,  deterrence, and incapacitation in the  case of  imprisonment. They should  not be developed with a view to filling  available  space with  a  compatible  number of bodies. We might as well  provide  that  the guidelines  specify  sentences that will not result in under  utilization of prisons.  There  is, of course,  a  better ap proach. We should amend the bill to  require those developing the sentenc ing guidelines determine  the  impact  the guidelines will have on the capac ity of the correctional system, proba tion as well as prisons, and then rec ommend to the Congress any increases  in capacity that the affected portion  of the system may require.

332,House,98,-0.494,1283,18,Mr. COYNE.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  strong support of House Concurrent  Resolution 42, a bill which expresses  the sense of Congress on the matter of  honorary consulates of the Republic  of South Africa located in the United  States.  The measure has three objectives:  First,  it calls on the Secretary of  State to refuse to approve the opening  of any additional honorary consulates  of South Africa in the United States.  Second, the bill asks the Secretary  of State to reassess the need for exist ing  honorary  consulates  of South  Africa in the United States.  Third, the measure requests that the  State Department's approval of an  honorary consulate of South Africa in  the city of Pittsburgh, PA, be rescind ed.  The South African Government's  systematic repression of blacks, con demned by the civilized nations of the  world, is rejected as well by the silent  majority of  that nation, a majority  silent not by choice but as a result of  political and social discrimination.  Let us consider recent events; 8 out  of 10 so-called coloreds and Asians re fused to take part last month in elec tions for a parliament which excludes  blacks. The protests which accompa nied the elections brought a response  from the South African Government  that was all too expected. South Afri can police attacked boycotters, pro testers,  and  journalists with  clubs,  whips, rubber bullets, and tear gas.  Some who protested a  recent rent  rise  in black areas of South Africa  have paid with their lives. More than  30 people were killed, and hundreds  more injured, in protests last month.  Surely  this  is not a nation which  merits closer diplomatic relations. By  allowing the opening of new honorary  consulates, which often promote closer  business  and  trade  ties with  the  United States, the State Department  would do just that.  I can assure you that the people of  Pittsburgh do not desire closer diplo matic ties with South Africa, nor do  we want an honorary South African  consulate in our city. Passage of this  sense of Congress resolution will put  this House on record in opposition to  the opening of the Pittsburgh honor ary consulate and any similar offices  in other cities. The approval of this  legislation would not affect our gener al  diplomatic  relations with South  Africa. We would continue to conduct  normal  diplomatic  business  the  State Department heeds the sense of  Congress. What would change  is  a  policy which allows the Government  of  South  Africa  to  expand  and  strengthen its political and economic  ties to the United States through the  opening of new honorary consulates in  this country even as it represses the le gitimate aspirations of the majority of  people in its own country.  if  I urge a yes vote on House Concur rent Resolution 42. At  this point,  would like to include in the REcORD a  selection of recent news articles which  describe the current situation in South  Africa:  I  [From the Pittsburgh Press]  UGLY FARcE IN SoUTH AFRicA  The embattled Asian and mixed-race resi dents of South Africa deserve the admira tion of free peoples everywhere. They have  thwarted a drive by their white-supremacist  rulers to put a benign mask on the ugly  system of racial segregation known as apart heid.  Last November Prime Minister Pieter W.  Botha ingeniously had white voters adopt a  new constitution that for the first time ap peared to give political rights to the coun try's 2.8 million ""coloreds"" (persons of white  and black blood) and 800,000 Asians, mostly  of Indian ancestry.  Each group would get a segregated cham ber of Parliament of its own. However, a  third chamber, exclusively white, could veto  laws passed by the other two. And on top of  all three would be a white president, most  likely Botha, with near-dictatorial powers.  The Asians  and  coloreds  saw  through  Botha's con game. It was an attempt  to  make South Africa look quasi-democratic to  a  critical world.  It would separate  them  from the 20 million black majority, which  got nothing, and help 4.5 million whites mo nopolize political power.  Coloreds were to go to the polls first. Last  week it was the Asians' turn. Both resisted  government pressure and overwhelmingly  boycotted Botha's farce. Only about 18 per cent of those eligible voted, discrediting the  process.  South African police reacted with their  usual violence, attacking boycotters, pro testers and  journalists with clubs, whips,  rubber bullets and tear gas. So much for  Botha's ""liberalization.""  When the plan for phony parliaments for  coloreds and Asians was adopted last year,  the U.S. State Department, with its mastery  of doublespe.ak, called it ""a step in the right  direction.""  Now that South Africa's non-whites have  rebuffed the effort to pretty up racial perse cution, what do Foggy Bottom's apologists  for apartheid have to say?  [From the Washington Fost, Aug. 30, 19841  VERDICT ON SoUTH AFRicAN REFoRM  The Verdict  that counts most has now  been pronounced on South Africa's political  reform. True, an earlier verdict had been de livered by the country's ruling white minori ty, which, consulting none of  the other  racial groups and least of all the disenfran chised black majority, last November over whelmingly approved a plan giving a limited  parliamentary voice to Indians and mixed race Coloreds. These two groups have now  weighed in. Since they would presumably be  the chief beneficiaries of what the sponsor ing whites proudly hall as a ""new dispensa tion,"" their verdict is of special importance.  It is, on the whole, devastating. Only 20 per cent of registered Indians voted for the new  parliamentary seats being offered them, and  only 30 percent of registered Coloreds.  Why such a minimal response? The whites  claim there was  intimidation. The charge  would be amusing, given the intimidation  practiced by South Africa's whites-locking  up leaders of the boycott movement on the  eve of elections, for instance-were it not a  ",1984

They are: Frank  Raflo, Loudoun Country Board of Supervi sors; John Devine, Loudoun County Histori cal Society; Hugh Harmon, Assistant Direc tor of Economic Development; Tom N&lls,  Attorney  for  the Beus Corporation; Ed  Bearss, Chief Historian of the Department  of the Interior; Russ Dickenson, National  Park Service Director; Jerry Rogers, Associ ate Director of Cultur&l Resources-Depart ment  of  the  Interior; Honorable  John  Hannum, U.S. District Judge, whose inspira tion and drive crowned all other efforts to  bring this occasion about today.  We should also be indebted to the Beus  Corporation which donated 61 acres for this  purpose; Cecil Culbertson, 11 acres; and. of  course,  the Veterans  Administration who  donated the origin&l 6 acres of the National  Milltary Cemetery here at Ball's Bluff;  amounting to a tot&l of 78 acres for the Na tion&! Historic Landmark.  Also, we should be indebted to a distin guished group of scholars and authors who,  in recent years, have shed new light on one  of the sm&llest battles with the largest con sequence  in  the Civil War: Dr.  Joseph  Harsh, George Mason University Depart ment of History; Gener&l Joseph Patch,  author of the narrative on Ball's Bluff; Dr.  Edward Bearss. Department of Interior and  Rowena Reed. author of Combined Oper ations in the Civil War.  It Is ironic that we should commemorate back to back-the Normandy  invasion on  June 6 and the Battle of Ball's Bluff today;  perhaps the best and the worst examples of  an amphibious assault on hostlle son by  U.S. troops.

334,,98,-0.478,1335,18,Mr. SCHEUER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to salute a most remarkable in dividual on the occasion of his 75th  birthday, a man whose  life-long en deavors have given new meaning  to  the word service.  As a civic leader in the Bronx for 45  years, Elias Karmon has devoted a  substantial amount of his time to work  voluntarny with dozens of groups and  organizations  to keep  the Bronx a  good place to live and work. He has  served, for example, on the board of  the Bronx Chamber of Commerce for  30 years and as its president for 4 con secutive years;  as chairman of  the  Bronx Council of the Albert Einstein  College of Medicine; as president of  the Bronx Rotaiy Club; as chairman  of  the executive  committee of  the  Bronx Boys Club; as vice president of  the American Jewish Congress, Bronx  Division; as chairman of the advisory  committee  of  the Bronx Venture  Corp.-a nonprofit local development  corporation; and as chairman of Vaca tions and Community Services for the  Blind.  Even though he shall be honored for  his past accomplishments during his  testimonial dinner on September 20,  Elias Karmon continues to this day to  be one of the most active citizens in  the Bronx. He currently serves not  only on the board of directors of the  Ponce De Leon Federal Savings &  Loan Association, which he cofounded,  but also a host of other civic organiza tions. For example, he continues  to  devote himself to community action in  the Bronx by serving on the boards of  the Bronx House, YMCA, Fordham  Road Area Development Corp., Re gional Aid for Interim Needs, South  Bronx Mental Health Council, Pelham  Parkway Mall  Development  Corp., Bronx Dance Theater, Bronx  Overall Economic Development Corp.,  and Pelham Parkway Jewish Center.  Of course, I am not the first to rec ognize Elias for his tremendous efforts  on behalf of those of us who live and  work in the Bronx. During his 16 years  as a member of the lay advisory board  of  the old Lincoln Hospital, and 9  Local  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  years as its chairman, the board ob tained the commitment for the build ing of the new Lincoln Medical Center.  In appreciation of his contributions,  the  Lincoln  Hospital  Community  Board and  the . administrative staff  dedicated the board conference room  as the ""Elias Karmon Board Confer ence Room."" Last February, the New  York Urban League cited Mr. Karmon,  as past chairman of the Bronx Urban  League Advisory Board, as a ""Charter  Member and Founder of the Bronx  Office  of  the  New  York Urban  League,'' and saluted him for ~ dedi cated service and leadership spanning  35  years. On  the ""Bill Boggs Live  Show"" on WNEW-TV in 1979, here ceived the coveted Jefferson Award for  Public Service.  An individual who devotes as much  concern for his fellow human beings,  dedicated as much effort to improving  his  community,  and  volunteers  as  much of his  life  to others as Elias  Karmon  has  is  a  rare  individual  indeed-an individual to whom those  of us who live and work in the Bronx  are very much indebted. Thank you,  Elias, for everything you have done  and for everything you continue to do  for the Bronx.e  CONGRATULATIONS TO EAGLE  SCOUT BRIAN WALSTROM  HON.

I ask my colleague,  the manager of that section,  if this  was deliberate?  ",1984
336,Senate,98,0.575,38,23,Mr. WALLOP.," Mr. President, the ac tions by the conference committee and  the Congress  in  the passage of  the  continuing resolution cause me great  concern. I have spoken elsewhere on  the gravity of the 5-month delay and  potential refusal of aid to the rebels  fighting  for  freedom  in Nicaragua.  The additional actions of the confer ence committee  in delaying deploy ment of MX and in reducing further  the funds authorized for the strategic  defense  initiative  demonstrate  that  the Congress is withholding from this  country the ability to def end itself. It  appears that Congress can't recognize  the nature of the threats we face in  the world  today. Unfortunately,  the  results of failure to face these threats  will be more difficult to deal with in  future years.  This general problem is demonstrat ed  in  the actions of the conference  committee in dealing with deployment  of MX  in Wyoming and Nebraska.  Over the past 2 years, the Air Force,  State and local government staff, offi cials, and citizens have been involved  in concentrated study of the impacts  associated with the deployment of MX  in southeastern Wyoming and western  Nebraska. These studies revealed that  the major impacts are associated with  the construction of major support fa cilities on F.E. Warren Air Force Base  in Cheyenne. These support facilities  are needed irrespective of whether 10  or 100 missiles are deployed. The stud ies also revealed that construction of  the community capital improvements  must begin immediately if the schools  and water is to be available when peak  construction impacts occur. The con ference deferred the $5.9 million fund ing for these facilities while giving ap proval to nearly $100 million associat ed with deployment of the first MX  missiles. As  the citizens of Wyoming  have learned in dealing with numerous  energy projects  in  the  last decade,  such neglect of community support fa cilities  is extremely unwise and will  only work to make deployment activi ties more difficult. I am hopeful that  the Appropriations Committees will  make  timely approval of reprogram ming requests for the impact mitiga tion funds a high priority.  At this same time, Mr. President, I  feel  I also must express my dismay  and disappointment that funding for  some very  long, and overdue water  projects was also stripped from  this  continuing resolution. It is most unf or tunate that authorized projects, such  as the Buffalo Bill Dam, in my State  of Wyoming were  thrown out along  with other water projects that had not  gone  through  the authorization and  appropriation  process  in  both  the  House and the Senate.  Modification for Buffalo Bill was ini tially authorized at $106,700,000 in Oc tober 1982. In 1983, the Department of  the Interior and the State of Wyoming  agreed  on  a  cost-sharing  proposal,  whereby the State of Wyoming would  pay more than 40 percent of the cap ital cost of  the project. Since  that  time, several attempts to appropriate  the actual  funds have been under mined, even though Wyoming has al ready come up with over $45 million to  cover its share of the project. It is my  sincere hope  that  this much-needed  water project will be funded shortly  after the 99th Congress convenes  in  January.  CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY AND THE CONTINUING  RESOLUTION  ",1984

339,Senate,98,0.262,207,23,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, as we  draw near the end of the 98th Con gress, I want to take a few moments to  set the record straight on the readi ness of our Armed Forces, and espe cially  the  substantial progress  that  has been made by this administration  during the past 4 years.  During hearings this past year, all of  the  Service  Chiefs who  appeared  before  the Senate Armed  Services  Committee  affirmed  the  significant  improvements that have taken place  in quantity and quality of personnel,  force modernization,  readiness  and  sustainability of our Armed Forces.  Because of recurring stories in the  media which  reported negatively on  our military preparedness, I wrote a  letter to the Chief of each of our mili tary services, asking for his assessment  of  the warfighting  capabilities  and  preparedness of his respective service.  The responses  I  received  leave no  doubt of the increased capabilities and  readiness of our military forces. While  all the goals may not have been ac complished during the first 4 years of  this  administration,  these  letters  attest to the substantial progress that  has been made.  I  ask unanimous consent  to have  printed in the RECORD the responses I  received from the Chief of Naval Op erations, Adm. James D. Watkins; the  Chief of Staff of the Army, Gen. John  A. Wickham, Jr.; the Chief of Staff of  the Air Force, Gen. Charles A. Gabri el;  and  the Commandant  of  the  Marine Corps, Gen. P.X. Kelley.  There being no objection,  the  re sponses were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  Press reports of Navy weapons shortages  are at least partly accurate in that supplies  of newer, more sophisticated weapons are  most critical. These shortages stem from in adequate funding in the late 70's, but recov ery is underway. Three years of improved  funding is beginning to take effect. Trends  in spare parts are up also as a result of im proved funding for both ship and aircraft  spares.  I appreciate this opportunity to provide  my thoughts on this issue, and am enclosing  a brief readiness assessment for your use. If  I may be of further assistance, please let me  know.  Sincerely,  JAMES D. WATKINS,  Admiral, U.S. Navy.  READINESS ASSESSMENT  Numbers  reporting  personnel  combat  readiness CCl, C2> since 1981 are up overall,  with surface ships up 39 percent, subma rines up 35 percent and aircraft squadrons  up 115 percent.  Retention across the board is at all time  highs.  93 percent of recruits hold high school di plomas.  Petty officer shortfalls of the early 80's  have been virtually eliminated.  The Naval Reserve is making solid gains  with transition to newest equipments and  will  reach 132,000 Selected Reservists by  1988.  The 600-ship goal is now in hand and will  be reached as planned in 1989.  New ships under contract, both nuclear  and conventional, will provide substantial  increases in capability: 2 CVN's, 9 AEGIS  cruisers, 7 Los Angeles class SSN's, 3 TRI DENT class SSBN's, 6 Oliver Hazard Perry  class FFG's, 34 support ships, and reactiva tion of the third battleship.  Combat readiness up 29 percent for sur face ships, 31 percent for SSN's, 34 percent  for SSBN's and  43  percent  for  aircraft  squadrons since 1981.  Aircraft procurement  is on schedule  to  match the needs of the 600-ship Navy, in cluding 375 new F-14, F/ A-18 and LAMPS  III.  Aircraft mission capable rates up 17 per cent and full mission capable rates up 50  percent overall and even higher  for de ployed units since 1981.  Ordnance  stocks  10-60  percent  higher  than in 1981 with long term outlook even  brighter.  Spare parts already on order will result in  over 50 percent  improvement when deliv ered in FY-86.  CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS,  October 9, 1984.  Hon. JoHN W. WARNER,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR WARNER:  I am responding  to your recent letter in which you expressed  your concern over  recent media  articles  about readiness, many of which are distort ed and factually incorrect criticisms of Navy  warfighting capability.  The true story, in fact, is one of dramatic  recovery. Measured relative to the situation  that existed in 1981, the year which marked  the turning point in readiness and sustain ability funding,  the Navy today has more  weapons and more spare parts at sea, and  better manning of ships and aircraft squad rons. The readiness indices for ships and air craft squadrons are up over 30 percent since  1981.  U.S. ARMY,  THE CHIEF OF STAFF.  Senator JOHN w ARNER,  U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEAR SENATOR WARNER:  I appreciate this  opportunity to provide an assessment of the  state of the Army. The single page response  you requested is enclosed. Also enclosed is a  copy of a paper on ""Total Army Readiness""  which you may find useful.  The Army's warfighting capability has  never been better in peacetime. However,  much work still  remains as we strive  to  attain an Army of Excellence.  Your continued support would be appreci ated by all of us in the Army.  In my opinion the Army today-its people  and resources-are the best I've seen in over  34 years of commissioned service.  Thanks, for your continued solid support.  Most sincerly,  JOHN A. WICKHAM, Jr.,  General, United States Army,  Chief of Staff.  ARMY CAPABILITY  The Army today, all components, is more  capable than at any time in recent history.  This is evidenced by improvements we have  made in force structure, readiness, modern ization, and sustainment.  For many years force structure planning  has  focused  on  developing  those  forces  needed to fight a major war; however, the  actual nature of conflict since World War II  has  been  of mid-to-low  intensity.  The  emerging strategic reality is that forces with  greater flexibility are required to respond to  these kinds of crises while maintaining the  capability to deal with the more dangerous  NATO  contingency.  In  this  respect,  the  Army  is making extensive force structure  changes. Principal changes include reshap ing the heavy divisions, expanding the light  forces, and placing increased reliance on Re serve Component units.  Readiness is the Army's first priority. At  the core of the improvements to Army read iness are the people that serve in uniform;  the quality of our soldiers has never been  better. Building on  this solid core, Army  programs have resulted in soldiers that are  better trained, better equipped, better sup ported,  and better able  to mobilize  and  deploy. Programs most often cited by com manders for providing the biggest readiness  gains  are:  development  of  the National  Training Center, expansion of overseas de ployment training, increased use of training  devices, increased Full-Time Manning in Re serve Component units, expansion of Prepo sitioning of Materiel Configured  in Unit  Sets CPOMCUS>. and increased fielding of  equipment and spare parts.  Extensive actions to modernize equipment  have been taken to counter growing Soviet  capabilities and provide our soldiers with  state-of-the-art equipment. The fielding of  new systems such as the Ml Tank, Bradley  Fighting Vehicle, Black Hawk Helicopter,  Multiple Launch Rocket System, and Per shing II Missile has done much to restore  the qualitative edge we want our forces to  have over potential adversaries. Our soldiers  can now maneuver better, shoot better, com municate better, night fight better, and sup port better. These systems are also neces sary for the employment of new doctrine  which was designed to increase our ability  to fight outnumbered and win.  Finally, our ability to sustain our forces  has been improved significantly through in creases  in war  reserve supplies of equip ment, spare parts, ammunition, and other  materiel.  The consensus of senior Army leaders is  that these improvements have increased the  deterrent value of our land forces. As dem onstrated by Army's performance in Grena da, we can act quickly and effectively should  deterrence fail. Although many challenges  still exist,  today's Army  is capable of re sponding across the entire spectrum of war fare  to protect and preserve our freedom  and national heritage.  ",1984

344,,98,0.227,766,23,Mr. BROOMFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, a  new holocaust is upon us. Recent re ports  from Afghanistan  reveal  that  the Soviet and Afghani military are  systematically killing Afghani civilians  and destroying the  infrastructure of  that once lovely land. The world must  be  told about  these horrible Soviet  atrocities. I want to share a revealing  article  from  the Christian Science  Monitor  on  this  important  subject  with my colleagues in the Congress.  While all of us often read press ac counts of human rights violations in  various countries around  the world,  the tragedy of Afghanistan often goes  unreported. We all know the sad histo ry of Soviet occupation of that once  free land and of our Government's ef forts  to bring  international pressure  upon the Soviet Union to withdraw.  While the Mujahideen freedom fight ers struggle on against overwhelming  odds to battle the Soviet invaders, the  poor Afghani peasants have become  the new victims of  the Soviet and  Afghani military machine. As refugees  try to leave Afghanistan for the safety  of Pakistan, Soviet airstrikes are  in tentionally directed at  these  fleeing  peasants. Many of them are  leaving  Afghanistan  in  the  aftermath  of  Soviet and Afghani scorched Earth op erations designed to destroy the civil ian  infrastructure.  Farms,  houses,  markets, schools, and hospitals have  been attacked and totally destroyed.  ",1984
345,,98,0.581,779,23,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to be able to share with my  colleagues a statement which was re cently  forwarded  to me  by Mr.  Edmund V. Pribitkin, president of the  Congress of Russian-Americans,  Inc.,  and resident of the 16th Congressional  District of Pennsylvania which I have  the privilege of representing. It is es pecially appropriate during this elec tion year to take time to reflect on the  freedoms which Americans enjoy as  citizens of the United States, and to  express our moral support for  those  who still suffer under the harsh, to talitarian rule of Soviet communism.  The October 1984 statement by  the  board of directors of the Congress oi  Russian-Americans follows:  32551  A DAY OF SORROW AND IRRECONCILABILITY,  1984  As we approach November the 7th, the  day when the Soviet Union annually cele brates  international communism's arroga tion of power in Russia, we-Russian-Ameri cans-appeal to the U.S. Government and to  freedom-loving citizens of this country to  designate it as a Day of Sorrow and Irrecon cilability.  Sadly,  albeit  fittingly,  among  all  the  ethnic groups making up the tapestry of  these United States of America, only the  Russian-Americans  persist  in  annually  asking their Government and their fellow  Americans  to observe  this  inglorious day.  Russian-Americans  feel  it  is  their sacred  duty to mark with mourning and defiance  the day international communism claimed  their former countrymen as its first victim.  Thus,  they  honor  their brothers  living  under the Soviet rule.  On this day we express our Sorrow for all  the victims of the communist terror, and  our Irreconcilability with  the  theroy and  practice of communist doctrine.  Moreover, let us not forget that November  7, 1917 marked not only the beginning of  iinmeasurable  sufferings  for  the Russian  and other enslaved people of  the Soviet  Union, but also the beginning of a global  human tragedy which today endangers the  existence of the Free World. Utilizing the  threat of a nuclear war, the Soviets have  gradually taken over key strategic positions  in all parts of the world. Today there hardly  a nation on the face of the earth that has  not been vicitimized by communist aggres sion.  Therefore, we ask the Government of the  United States and all other Free World gov ernments to designate November the 7th as  a Day of Sorrow and Irreconcilability.  Over the past 67 years the Soviet govern ment has spared no effort in trying to strip  the Russian nation of its heritage. Despite  the desecration  and destruction of over  50,000 churches and monasteries, the perse cution and extermination of millions of  people in concentration camps and prisons,  we witness today in the Soviet Union a re vival of faith and awakening of national  pride. The determination of  the Russian  people to live free blazes as never before.  Perhaps the Russian soul, having nurtured  its people through their long, barren winter  of oppression, senses at last spring's hymn  of freedom yearning to be sung. How more  can we honor our brothers than by lending  voices  to this chorus? For by proclaiming  this day of Sorrow and Irreconcilability, we  intone ""Let There Be Light"" and indeed for  all those who hear our voices in their dark ness there is light!e  CENSORSHIP OF FEDERAL EM PLOYEES  BY  THE  ADMINIS TRATION  HON.

Having  served with KENT  on  the  Ways and Means Committee for the  last 6 years, I probably know as well as  anyone how effective KENT has been.  The business and the tax people have  confidence in him, the members of the  committee respect him, and the House  realize he is effective.  Still, even though KENT has been in volved in some of the most controver sial issues before the Congress, he has  never been unpleasant or overbearing.

Quite often we are saying goodEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  bye to Members with whom we have  served, and this has a tinge of sadness.  Such is the case as we pay tribute to  two  of our  colleagues  from Texas,  CHICK KAZEN and KENT HANCE.  It has been my good fortune to know  these two fine gentlemen and to count  them as friends. CHICK, of course, is a  senior member of the Armed Services  Committee, on which I serve, and we  have served  together on subcommit tees. He has made his mark during a  20-year career here in the Congress.  My wife, Nancy, and I recently visited  countries in the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization with CHICK and CONNIE  KAzEN. Their dedication in service to  America was exemplified in our con tacts with high-ranking foreign offi cials and, as has been his style, CHICK  was on target in asking the kinds of  questions that needed to be asked. We  wish the Kazen's much joy and happi ness as they leave us.  KENT and CAROL HANCE were among  the first people we met as we came to  Washington together as Members of  the 96th Congress. We have continued  this friendship through these 6 years.  Carol and Nancy have often gotten to gether at lunch to fellowship and dis cuss children, school, church, and all  the things associated with transplant ed families in the capital area. Kent is  a  bright,  capable,  and  energetic  member of this House, and let me say  that he is very fortunate to have such  a  charming and delightful wife  as  Carol. Her Christian commitment and  vibrant personality are a great asset to  KENT. And considering his youth, ex perience, and ambition,  I would say  that the future for the Hance's should  be bright.  May God's richest blessings be with  the Kazen and Hance families. We will  miss you.e  TRIBUTE TO KENT HANCE  HON.

The  departure of KENT HANCE is particular ly hard to accept. Since the day we  came to Congress together in 1979, I  have constantly learned from him. His  service has been marked by compe tence, diligence, intellect, and dedica tion. KENT  does  his homework, he  works hard, and he gets the job done.  Working with KENT HANCE has been  a constant pleasure. No matter how  pressures have mounted, he has never  October 12, 1984  lost the good humor that sustains us  all. It's not easy to be tough, to make  unpleasant decisions, or to explain the  complexities of the important legisla tion that KENT has developed. Yet, he  is the expert's expert and never ap pears to show strain. Every one of us  appreciates his  professionalism, but  even more, we appreciate his kindness  and unfailing courtesy. It is good to  have this opportunity to express how  much we admire him and to wish him  Godspeed as his life takes a new direc tion. KENT, you have been one of our  great resources.

Mr. Speak er, only two men have represented the  19th Congressional District of Texas  in  the House  of Representatives George Mahon  and  KENT  HANCE.  Many of us in this body had the great  privilege  of  serving  with  George  Mahon, and just as we bid him a sad  farewell 6 years ago, we now bid an af fectionate  farewell  to his  successor,  my good friend, KENT HANCE. These  two men have given west Texas  a  strong and effective voice in Congress.  Like George Mahon,  our  colleague  KENT HANCE will be hard to replace.  As a member of the Ways and Means  Committee KENT  HANCE  has  given  Texas a strong and influential voice on  vital issues affecting our area. He has  played a tremendous role in articulat ing energy and water problems, and  his constituents are going to miss that  influence.  People  in my  area  of northeast  Texas  are  particularly  grateful  to  KENT HANCE for the active and effec tive part he has played  in helping  workers at  the Lone Star Steel Co.  whose jobs have been taken away by  low wage, heavily subsidized foreign  steel imports. He has worked closely  with me in taking the message of our  steelworkers to the highest councils of  government,  and  I will  always  be  grateful to him.  On  tax  and  budget  policy KENT  HANCE has been in the forefront of ef forts to utilize the Internal Revenue  Code as a  vehicle  to stimulate  the  economy and provide new jobs. He is a  strong proponent of  free enterprise  and the free marketplace, and his can do,  hard-charging  attitude on vital  economic issues has always made him  a force to be reckoned with.

350,,98,-0.254,805,23,Mr. CARR.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay recognition to Ms. Shei lah Denne of Clarkston, MI.  I am speaking on Ms. Denne's behalf  because she is a concerned citizen who  has been working to change a danger ous condition in her community. The  condition I refer to is the traffic situa tion on Dixie Highway and other area  roads. In the first 5 months of this  year alone, there were 59 injuries and  132 property accidents on  the Dixie  Highway. Since January,  there have  been 5 deaths on this road alone, and  20  traffic  fatalities  on  area  roads.  Businesses along  the highway have  suffered  from  the dangerous  traffic  situation discouraging patrons  from  visiting.  Ms. Denne was  the driving  force  behind a petition campaign  that re sulted in 2,000 signatures being deliv ered  to my office from citizens who  shared her concern over  the Dixie  Highway problem. For 4 years, she has  met with disappointment. But she did  not stop trying.  This matter was brought to my at tention early this year, and I began  my efforts to get Federal funds for the  renovation of the Dixie Highway and  other area roads. I introduced legisla tion  to appropriate money  for  that  purpose, and since then, this project  has been through the entire gamut of  legislative meanderings, and caused no  small  amount  of  controversy. The  Dixie project has been in four differ ent bills, been brought up before the  Rules Committee three times, and for  a time was the sole point of controver sy in a major appropriations bill. It  was marked up on June 19 of  this'  year, was reported out of committee  on June 22, and was the subject of nu merous hearings before the Appropria tions  and Rules Committee. Many  were  the discussions on strategy  to  guide this bill through the many legis lative obstacles I encountered.  I  also held  two  town meetings on  how  to remedy the dangerous situa tion on the highway and to let resi dents of the area know what progress  I was making. These meetings were  held at Our Lady of the Lakes Church  in Waterford, MI, on March 30 and  June 11. Several hundred people were  in attendance and let me know their  views and suggestions on what should  be done.  I  took that advice back to  Washington, and furthered my efforts  to make sure that these citizens' inter ests were served.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  But all that is over now, and I am  proud  to  stand here and announce  that there is now $12 million in Feder al money earmarked in the continuing  resolution passed by the Congress last  night  for  improvements  on Dixie  Highway and other area roads. This  has been the only highway project to  pass the 98th Congress, and I am glad  to have been a part of it.  Construction will take place in sever al stages over the next few years, and  what are now fearful stretches of road  will  be  smooth-running,  important  avenues for the area.  There are many people who helped  along the way. Senator CARL LEVIN, in  particular, was helpful at a  critical  juncture in the Senate. But ultimately  the biggest ""Thanks"" goes  to Sheila  Denne. The community owes a debt of  gratitude to Sheila for caring enough  to get involved, and for not giving up  during the 4 years of discouragement  and the long, but successful, legislative  struggle.  I would  like  to  thank Ms.  Denne for helping to bring the matter  to my attention so that I could become  involved, and I want to commend her  as well. She has had the courage and  tenacity to continue fighting, and will  now see her ideas become concrete re ality .e  STATE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMS  SALVADOR HAS NAPALM  HON. EDWARD J.

If we examine the role that textiles  play in our economic sector, it is ap parent that not only is the industry  spread across the entire Nation, but it  also represents a vast pool of workers  engaged in producing a wide range of  top quality products. The roots of the  textile  industry  have  spread  far  beyond  the mill  towns  and outlet  stores, having played an integral role  in  the growth of such  industries as  ",1984

I wish to congratulate NHS, and am  happy  to  have  this opportunity  to  report their good works to the Mem bers here today. Neighborhood Hous ing Services Week and the accomplish ments of NHS both serve as testimony  to what achievements can be made in  our neighborhoods through the coop eration of various groups within  the  community.e  NADER NOMINATED FOR  SLEAZE AW ARD  HON.
