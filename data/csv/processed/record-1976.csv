9,Senate,94,-0.396,108,2,Mr. MOSS.," Mr. President, today, as we  take up  the conference report on  the  Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory  Reform Act of 1976, I would like to point  out an important provision which will  serve us well  in our efforts to preserve  natural resources and the environment.  I refer here to section 204 which is con cerned with discriminatory freight rates  for  the transportation of recyclable or  recycled materials. What we have done  is  required  the  Interstate Commerce  Commission to investigate the rate struc ture for transportation of recyclable or  recycled materials. After public hear ings,  the Commission  is  to determine  whether the discriminatory rates against  recyclable and  recycled materials are  justified. If the rates are, either in whole  or in part unjustly discriminatory or un reasonable, and  they certainly appear  that way to me, then the ICC is to issue  orders requiring the removal from  the  rate structure of these unjust or unrea sonable rates and report annually to the  Congress and  the President on its ac tions.  In order to insure that these investi gations are appropriately broad enough  to bring in the environmental aspects of  the  recyclable and  recycled materials  rate structure, the Administrator of the  Environmental  Protection Agency  is  granted authority to participate fully in  the ICC investigations.  Mr. President, recycled and recyclable  materials transportation rates have un duly burdened an industry whose very  being helps to conserve our precious nat ural resources and protect the environ ment. I  thank those who have worked  with me on this issue for so long for their  assistance in seeing our success in finally  legislating removal of these unjust rate  structures which only serve to accelerate  the depletion of our virgin resources.  ",1976
10,Senate,94,-0.43,108,2,Mr. DURKIN.," Mr. President, hope fully  the President will  recognize  the  hard work and long hours which have  gone into the Rail Revitalization Act by  signing it tonight or tomorrow when it  reaches his desk.  What makes it imperative that he sign  the legislation is the state of the rail roads in this country. The entire north ern rail system, which encompasses 17  States in the industrial and agricultural  heartland of the Nation, hangs at this  moment by a slender thread. The pri vate/public effort to prevent the collapse  of the Eastern railroads, and with them  125,000 miles of profitable lines through out the Nation that connect with them,  is coming to a head in exactly 1 month.  On February 28, a private, State-char tered corporation named ""ConRail"" will  assume the responsibility for the rebuild ing and operation of the seven major  bankrupt railroads east of the Mississippi  and north of the Mason-Dixon line. To  restore our necessary but decrepit rail  transportation to a paying proposition  in this region will require massive infu sions of capital totaling around $16 bil lion in the next decade. Even after a  steady decline over three decades, rail roads still carry 40 percent of the inter city freight of the country, yet they re turn only 20 pe!'cent of the revenue.  Continued reliable service is as essen tial to the Nation today as it was during  the  transcontinental expansion era of  the Golden Spike. Over 100,000 jobs are  directly at stake in the industry, with  millions more throughout the Nation fi nancially dependent upon the econom ical and efficient connections rail trans port provides between raw resources, in dustry, and the marketplace. More than  12 percent of the entire New Hampshire  work force, some 38,000 employees, work  in jobs which are touched by the tracks  in a direct way, shipping either finished  products or raw materials.  The bill is vital to the interests of both  consumers and industry. It is supported  by labor and management. For this rea son, the subcommittee, chaired by Sen ator HARTKE, and the Commerce Com mittee guided by Chairman MAGNUSON,  worked hard to forge a bill that would  put the railroads back on their feet with out putting a Federal monkey on their  back.  When the Penn Central began to fail  1n the early 1970's, many reasoned that  the only option left to the bankrupt rail roads was subsidization by the Federal  Government or outright nationalization  of the railroads to insure service.  Instead  the Surface Transportation  Subcommittee, under the leadership of  Chairman HARTKE, has forged a hard~  nosed program by which  the  railroad  industry can ""bootstrap"" itself back into  shape with a modicum of Federal assist ance.  For too long the railroad industry has  been the forgotten and neglected step child of the transportation industry, ex cept when it came to oppressive Federal  regulation.  Every mode of transportation has had  tax dollar support in recent years, and  every mode has had more than the rail roads. Since 1970,  the Federal Govern ment has annually appropriated some $20  billion in Federal aid to highways and  motor carriers, $16 billion to waterways  and barge shippers, $1 billion for mass  transit and passenger conveyance, $500  million for air carriers and airports and  half a billion in maritime subsidies. Dur ing the same 5-year period, the sum of  Federal assistance to railroads came to  barely $300 million a year, which  in cludes the emergency Penn Central Rail road bailout.  On the other hand, the railroads have  consistently been the most overregulated  sector of transportation.  The Interstate Commerce Commission  has consistently kept the rate of return  on investment in the railroad industry  well below the cost of capital. Average  earnings by the Nation's railroads pres ently equal 1 percent, yet the interest on  capital loans is presently near 12 per cent. As a result of ICC regulations, U.S.  -railroads operate approximately 22,5'00  miles of unprofitable low density track  'Which lose about $144 million annually.  For  these reasons,  reasons of equity  as well as sound national policy,  the  Senate  Surface  Transportation Sub Committee has attempted to draft a bill  providing a fiscally stable, unfettered rail  system for the Northeast. ICC meddling  in rate proceedings has been decreased.  Antitrust problems have been avoided by  providing a competitive structure within  the region. ConRail, with the backing of  the Treasury, will assume the ownership  of 15,000 miles of bankrupt lines and pro vide rehabilitation for the tracks and fa cilities for these essential intercity cor ridors.  The bill provides $6.5 billion for start up mo:ney for the most massive corporate  reorganization in U.S. history. The new  public entity, ConRail, will allow the rail roads to be run by railroad men, not law yers and financiers. The funds will flow  to ConRail to buy new rolling stock and  to straighten its dilapidated track. They  will flow to Amtrak to provide 110 miles  per hour passenger service from Boston  to the District of Columbia. They will  flow  to the Department of Transporta tion and the U.S. Railway Association to  fund the first comprehensive studies of  the rail needs of the Nation.  But most important, Mr. President, arc  the funds that will.flow to the States to  allow the continued service along the low  density  lines which  the railroads have  abandoned as unprofitable. Included in  the bill are $180 million to cover the costs  of subsidizing, improving or flat-out buy ing and operating lightly trafficked lines  over a 2-year period. This funding will  allow  the State of New Hampshire  to  purchase and maintain, or repair and  lease the operation of such essential lines  as the Concord-to-Lincoln route, to in sure  safe,  environmentally acceptable,  energy efficient freight service along the  State's central industrial axis.  The  inclusion of  this mechanism  to  return Federal money to the States who  have  their own  ideas about what rail  service is necessary for the local economy  is what I consider to be a key achieve ment of the bill. The theory that the  lowest  level of government which can  deal with a problem ought  to be  the  highest level of government to get the  responsibility has been adhered to ad mirably in this case, and I strongly sup port this Federal cost-sharing with New  Hampshire.  Mr. President, our railroads have been  our strength as an industrial nation and  a world power for a century. They re main an essential, if neglected, part of  America's remarkable economic capacity.  The challenge  to  rebuild  the crippled  lifeline is a great one; but I believe the  need is present and the spirit that built  the transcontinental railroads can still  be summoned. I am proud to have had a  hand in the drafting of this bill, and I  urge the Senate and the President to add  their approval and set our railroads on  the track to recovery.  Let me end, however, with a word of  caution. This is a big first step we are  being asked today, but only the first of  ",1976

I take ~his opportunity to ask the  chairman a question concerning a matter  in my congressional district.  Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding  that the bill contains a provision that  we refer to as the P. & L.E. amendment.  Mr. Speaker, during the recess it was  brought to my personal attention for the  first  time  that potentially  this would  have an effect on my  friends  in  the  Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers  and others in the railroad industry in  Ashtabula,  Ohio,  tllis  particular  amendment could possibly be construed  to mean that the entire operation of this  line would be taken over by the P. & L.E.  Mr. Speaker, my friends in the railroad  industry up in Ashtabula have been as sured verbally that this is not the in tention of the P. & L.E. I have pledged  to help them to get this in writing. But  I wonder it the gentleman would at this  time give me some assurance  for my  friends that this bill will not have a dis astrous effect upon them.  ",1976

16,House,94,-0.526,134,2,Mr. MITCHELL of Maryland.," Mr.  Chairman and my colleagues, I think we  need to get some facts straight about this  act. If we were to put any Government  agency on a scale to rate it from zero  to 100, any fair,  just, equitable rating  the Renegotiation Board would, at  best, place it at about 10 points.  We have had an  ineffective  instru mentality of Government insofar as the  Renegotiation Board is concerned. There  are reasons for that, of course. I  think  the Congress must  take part of  the  blame. All we did was year after year to  simply extend the act, and we did that  10 or 12 times, as far as I know. I think  the Board must take a part of the re sponsibility. I  think that the Executive  branch must take a part of the responsi bility for the dismal performance turned  in by the Renegotiation Board.  But let us forget now about placing  the burden and assessing the blame for  what went wrong in the past. I think we  must consider how we can take an inef fective board and make it an effective  instrumentality of government.  Mr. Chairman, that is exactly what  our bill is intended to do. If we doubt  that the Board has been ineffective in  the past, let us examine  just this one  fact:  that according to testimony from  the Board before our committee, there  is a grand total of in excess of $90 billion  in contracts, most of them defense con tracts, dating back  to 1967, that have  never been examined by the Board in  terms of whether there were any excess  profits. Is that any indication of the ef fectiveness of the Board?  If the Members doubt that my charges  that the Board has been ineffective are  correct, let us just bear in mind the facts  presented before our committee and be fore our subcommittee, namely, that a  disproportionate burden fell on the small  businesses, as far as the.Board was con cerned, and the big companies, the big  defense  contractors,  remained practi cally immune from any kind of consid eration by the Board as to any kind of  determination as to whether excess prof its have been made.  The question has been raised about the  lack of a definition of ""excess profits"" in  our legislation.  I would  suggest  that  this  area  is  treated, and I would further suggest that  the members of the committee who raise  a question about the definition of excess  profits perhaps should have fashioned a  definition that would have made good  sense and which could have been acted  on by all the members of the committee.  I say that because I know their sagacity  and wisdom and ability to handle words  well. However, to the best of my knowl edge, this did not transpire.  ",1976

18,,94,-0.007,147,2,Mrs. HECKLER of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, we had the occas~.on this after noon  to hear  the distinguished Prime  Minister of Israel, Yitzhak. Rabin, as he  so eloquently discussed the concerns and  aspirations of his great nation, our ally  in the Middle East.      The  Prime Minister  echoed  my  thoughts when he said o~ .the United  Nations:  The wo1ds of its charter have been abused  and devalued. Its moral resources have been  eroded by extortion and appeasement. None  of us  in the free world have fared well 1n  this climate.  What he said, and what I have been  saying for many months, is that Israel  is not the sole target of those nativns  who would make the U.N. a forum f01  invective and hate. They have another  target in mind, my colleagues. They are  trying to reach us through our ally.  Daniel Moynihan, our forceful spokes man at the U.N., has recognized this, as  have many of us who have followed the  Arab-Israeli conflict closely.  Mr. Speaker, we must continue  to  maintain our strong support for Israel.  Failure to do so would weaken our posi tion with our other allies throughout the  world. It is not only in our best interest,  but in the best interest of world peace  that Israeli-American cooperation con tinue unabated.  Only when the Arab nations recognize  Israel and reconcile  themselves  to the  country's right to exist can there be a  meaningful effort toward a permanent  peace in the Middle East. As Prime Min ister Rabin said:  The Palestinian issue began with the over all Arab posture on the legitiinacy of the  Jewish State of  Israel. Only when  that  posture changes will  the. Palestinian  issue  be coilstructively and finally tackled.  We in the United States desire peace  in the Middle East. Certainly the Jewish  people who have fought for centuries,  against all manner of barbarisms,  to  preserve themselves, want peace.  But as long as the hate mongers con tinue their warlike policies in whatever  forum  is available to  them,  there will  be no peace. And though our common  desire for peace in the Mid-East is not  the only bond which joins us to Israel  it is an important one. I intend to con tinue my support for the State of Israel.  We dare not back away from our obliga tion to this country.  THE LATE PAUL ROBESON, SR.  ",1976
19,,94,-0.658,147,2,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, Paul  Robeson,  that  great  scholar.  singer,  actor, and fighter  for human dignity,  died last Friday at the age of 77, after  an extended illness. Mr. Robeson, born  in 1898, the son of an escaped slave, was  during the first half of the 20th century  one of the most celebrated artists and  influential political  figures  to emerge  from black America. Lauded hlterna tionally  for his abilities, he was  fre quently denounced in his own country  because he stood for  the rights of all  people, at a time when racism and polit ical paranoia were at their heights.  That Paul Robeson was talented and  versatile, no one would dispute. A Phi  Beta Kappa and football all-American at  Rutgers University, he later starred ill  11 films. He toured America end Europe  performing highly praised concerts of  black music sung in a rich baritone voice.  During the years 1925 to 1950, he became  one  of  the  foremost American  per formers.  However,  Paul  Robeson  separate art from politics.  ""The artist must elect  to  fight for  freedom or fo1 slavery,"" he stated. ""I  have made my choice. I had no alterna tive.""  The choice made by Robeson showed  a strength of c.haracter which did not  allow him to sell his convictions to reap  personal benefits. He spoke openly of  police brutality,  lynchings,  denial  of  civil  rights,  and  labor  exploitation  against blacks and the poor in this coun try. He used his great talent as a speaker  at rallies and demonstrations and sang  at benefits for victims of oppression. He  placed himself at the forefront in the  struggle  for  freedom  and  justice  in  America.  Because of his outspoken support in  the  struggles  for  human  1ights, he  traveled Europe, and his outspoken sup port of Third World anticolonial move ments, his career as a performing artist  was destroyed. During the era of Mc Carthyism, he was brought before  the  Senate Judiciary Committee and asked  whether he was a Communist. Though  privately denying he was a member of the  Communist Party, he refused to answer  the committee on the grounds that to do  so would allow the invasion of his rights  as a citizen. He believed that his political  affiliations were his business. Mr. Robe son was branded a Communist and a  dange1 tO :p.ational security. His pa,ssport  not  did  ap public  to 1958 when his  was seized to prevent him from traveling  internationally. Opponents disrupted his  concerts, causing Concert hall managers  to refuse him bookings. In 5 years his  income  plummeted  from  $100,000  to  $6,000 a year. Prints of some of his early  films were destroyed. His name was re moved from library records.  Mr. Robeson made  few  pearances from 1950  passport was  returned. That year he  made a  triumphant return to Carnegie  Hall after an 11-year absence. He then  went abroad where he continued to per form until falling ill. He returned to the  United States in quiet retirement in 1963  and remained here until his death last  Friday.  Paul Robeson stands as a monument  to  the capacity of the human spirit to  achieve excellence  in  the face of ad versity. His talent and courage fused to  manifest personal greatness despite the  conditions under which he  lived. Mr.  Robeson gave of himself, whether on the  concert stage or the picket line. He sang,  struggled,  suffered,  and died  for  the  cause of human dignity. We could ask  no more of him.  ",1976

21,,94,-0.506,160,2,Mr. BROWN of California.," Mr. Speak er, as we begin a new legislative session,  and our committees  review  legislation  within  our  respective  jurisdictions,  would hope that we would all have some  time to consider one of the major cross cutting issues before the Nation. That  issue is energy policy and programs.  The last few years have seen the en actment of several major pieces of leg islation that could, if properly admin istered, significantly reduce our wasteful  use of precious fossil fuels. The Congress  established the Energy Research and De velopment Administration, and gave it  a strong, pro-energy conservation char ter with the ""Federal Nonnuclear Energy  R. & D. Act of 1974,"" for exactly this  reason. The recently enacted ""Energy  Policy and Conservation Act"" similarly  established a .strong, proenergy conserva tion poUcy. and gave the Administrator  of  the Federal Energy Administration  signiftcant authority to encourage energy  conservation.  Even with  these  landmark acts,  I  sense a  feeling that the Congress has  failed in the area of energy conservation.  There are some areas where  the Con . gress has failed to take advantage of an  opportunity to mandate energy conserva tion measures, such as in the area of  home insulation standards, but while the  Congress has had some failures, the ad ministration has failed  in many more  areas to vigorously use the authority al ready granted to it.  An example that I am most fanilliar  with is the Energy Research and Devel opment Administration. This agency has  clear and specific legislative authority, I  would call it a mandate, to engage in a  vigorous energy conservation program.  While this year's budget is better than  last year's budget  in  this  regard,  the  conservation program is still only 4 pel' cent of  the  total budget, compared  to  about 3 percent in last year's budget.  Even  this would not matter if it were  not for the fact that the major potential  near-term improvements in the national  energy budget can come  from energy  conservation  research,  development,  demonstration and implementation pro grams. This is not all ERDA's job, to be  sure, but ERDA cannot even begin  to  help the FEA carry out the requirements  of the ""Energy Policy and Conservation  Act'' without a larger, and more diversi fied energy conservation program. Be sides this lack of linkage between laws,  there  are  several  other  fundamental  prablems with the ERDA approach to en ergy programs. These issues were per haps best summarized in testimony by  the Congressional Office of Technology  Assessment to the Committee on Science  and Technology as follows:  1. Inadequate provision is made for coop eration and coordination between ERDA and  other Federal agencies and state and  local  governn1ents.  2. Little attention is devoted to near-term  (next ten years) energy problems.  3. Only limited attention is given to socio economic research and analysis in addressing  the nation's energy problems.  4. ERDA's program overemphasizes energy  s1..1pply technology relative to consumption.  5. The development of effective commer cialization policies  is not adequately  ad dressed iu the ERDA Plan.  6. Careful attention should be given to as sessing energy resources.  7. Physical,  institutional, and social con straints may limit the progress oi the ERDA  Energy Plan.  8. The Plan appears to overemphasize elec trification.  9. The ERDA Plan relies on assumptions  which appear  to bias its priorities toward  high  technology,  capital  intensive  energy  suppl}' alternatives.  10. Application and questions wlth respect  to net energy analysis receive little attention.  There are many areas of the adminis tration's energy program budget that re quire congressional alterations. My hope  is that this Congress will look at the pro grams currently on the books, and the  programs the administration intends to  fund, and decide to fund those programs  which maximize  energy  conservation  while creating many thousands of new  jobs.  ABZUG WELCOMES RABIN'S OFFER  TO !NEGOTIATE PEACE WITH ARABS  ",1976
22,,94,-0.597,160,2,Ms. ABZUG.," Mr. Speaker, Israeli Prime  Minister Rabin has  :nade a new and  courageous offer  in his address to  the  joint session of Congress today. It repre sents a significant step forward on the  long road to peace in the Middle East.  Now it is up to the Arab bloc to re spond with equally significant conces sions. Are its leaders prepared to meet  with the Israelis ""at any time, at any  place,"" as offered by Mr. Rabin? There  can be no doubt that it is time to end the  maneuverings  that have given unwar ranted  recognition and prominence  to  the PLO and which have turned the U.N.  Assembly into an anti-Israeli forum and  move matters  toward a Geneva Peace  Conference,  as Prime Mi.nister Rabin  proposes. It is certainly time for face to  face talks between the leaders of Israel  and the Arab nations. Is it too much to  ask the Arab nation leaders to take this  ""risk"" for peace?  Under the Rabin plan, all of Israel's  Arab neighbors would participate in the  peace conference, the aim of which is the  full and complete settlement of Israel's  borders and the absolute acceptance by  all participants of Israel's legitimacy and  permanence. Prime Minister Rabin's of fer is not predicated on any un,yielding  territorial claims by Israel. It is not pred icated on exclusion of any of the parties  to the conflict, including the Palestinians.  What  is essential  is  that  the Arab  bloc,  including  the Palestinians, once  and for all accept the fact of the exist ence of Israel. The survival of a militarily  secure Israel is the key to a settlement  and Israel must be equipped with  the  means  to guarantee  that survival. As  Prime Minister Rabin sayswe alone are responsible for our own de fense. This is how it has been;  this is how  it must be.  I am disturbed by the proposed reduc tion in the amount of U.S. aid requested  by the Ford administration for Israel, be cause only a militarily strong Israel can  have a  strong negotiating position at  Geneva or anywhere else.  The United States, whose  friendship'  has been crucial to the survival of Is rael, must continue and extend its mili tary support for Israel, and assure that  there is no interruption of the necessary  supply of materiel to that tiny nation.  It must also work toward a peace set tlement for  the Middle East that can  realize for the Jewish nation the contin uance of an independent democratic so ciety, secular in the equality of all its  citizens, Jew and non-Jew alike, before  the law, and founded upon the historic  Jewish values of which Prime Minister Rabin spoke.  Prime Minister Rabin has held out an  olive branch. Let us hope that it will not  be shot down by the PLO.  ANOTHER BANKING DISASTER?  ",1976
23,,94,-0.27,173,2,Mr. PREYER.," Mr. Speaker, this past  weekend the former Governor of North  Carolina Terry Sanford announced his  withdrawal from the race for President  of the United States. Governor Sanford  now returns to his duties as president of  Duke University, a role he distinguishes  as he has his past service as a combat  paratrooper officer, attorney, State sen ator, and Governor. I am certain he will  continue to speak out on important is sues as he has in recent months. The  kind of message he has for our country  is exemplified by the following statement  printed in the Raleigh, N.C., News and  Observer some weeks ago. It is an ap peal not so much for the election 'of a  candidate as for the election of reason  and faith in our pursuit of national goals.  It is a message that is strong with North  Carolina good sense and I commend it  to all candidates in the coming year and  to my colleagues in this House in partic ular:  TERRY SANFORD  General Robert E. Lee gave North Caro linians the ""Tar Heel"" nickname. After one  of the fiercest conflicts of the Civil war, ac cording  to Creecy's ""Grandfather Tales of  North Carolina,"" the North Carolina troops  were taunted by soldiers from another state  whom they felt had folded under pressure  during the attack. In derision, because North  Carolina was a big producer of tar, pitch and  turpentine, they yelled, ""Any more tar down  in the Old North State, boys?""  ""Not a bit,"" retorted a battle-weary North  Carolinian. ""Jeff Davis brought it all up. He's  going to put it on your heels to make you  stick better in the next fight.""  General Lee, hearing of the incident, re marked; ""God bless the Tar Heel boys.""  I have been asked by The News and Ob server to state my political platform, but I  cannot do this adequately without starting  where I began. I have always felt there was  something special about North Carolina. I  admit to prejudice.  I grew up in Laurinburg on dusty Cale donia Road before Kerr Scott's road bonds.  We lived in a rented house. In the summer  we suckered and handed  tobacco on Jack  Roper's farm and picked cotton for Thad  Peel, and worked daily in our own big garden  to  keep  desperately  ahead  of  the  nut  grass. The cotton mill behind our garden  ran two twelve-hour shifts. The whistle blew  at six and six, starting the choir of crowing~  roosters, city limits in those days being no  bar to chickens.  Herbert Hoover was elected President, Gene  Tunney beat Jack Dempsey, Jack Murphy  went off to college at Chapel Hill, Wherever  that was, and Jennings King and La.uder  Gibson went to a college Mr. Duke was build ing at Durham, which my father, being ~  Methodist, thought was wonderful.  What has all this to do with my running  for president? It has a lot to do with it. It  also has a lot to do with a ""Tar Heel,"" and  being from North C.arolina.  My father and grandfather had a hardwa=re  store. It went broke when Herbert Hoover  was president. Jobs that people worked at  just disappeared  in those bleak years. The  mills slowed down so much the weekly pay  averaged $5. Cars sat idle for lack of gasoline  and license plates, either jacked up waiting  . for~ bettpr day, or .g:ath~rl,ng .du~t .until .the  tires leaked fiat.  FarmS and homes were foreclosed. Elec tricity beyond the city limit was a novelty.  The ""New Town"" was a deplorable  slum.  Schools were eight months and even years,  and more dropped out than stayed in. One of  the banks in town went broke and the one  that kept open didn't seem to mean much  to the average citizen. Many schools paid  teachers  in ""script""  to keep from closing.  The merchants  accepted  the  script,  and  the teachers kept too.ching.  All of  these conditions were  totally be yond the control of  the people who were  most benighted. It was as if some god on  Mc;mnt Mitchell had decreed a blight on the  lanq.. It had nothing to do with willingness  to work hard. The forces of Wall Street and  the bank panic and the paralysis of Washing~  tori were  beyond  the  reach  of  ordinary  mortals.    Out of this I saw citizens of a little North  Carolina town show the grit Robert E. Lee  talked about. The rations were short, but the  cheer was good. There was never any question  of giving up. They would . work .out of it.  Self reliance and concern for others not so  lucky marked  their  lives. The  tar on  the  heels stuck.  Off in Raleigh a governor wa.s saying the  sta.te must have a  sales  tax. To keep our  schools open, he said, the state must pay  the bills. A tax on food and clothes and medi cine, when we could hardly buy them in the  first place! To critics, Governor Ehringhaus  said, ""If it is a choice between a sales tax  on the one hand and a decent school on the  other, I stand for the school."" I understood  that. That was my kind of platform.  In Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt was  starting Social security  to do away with  ""county homes"" and abject poverty for older  people. He was putting people back to work,  understanding that the working man and  woman came first, and that the prime pur~  pose of government was to help P.eople to help  themselves. A lot of fat cats objected, but  President Roosevelt  insisted that such was  the purpose of government. That is why the  American settlers fled Europe. Individual op portunity. The right to make the most of  your own life, regardless of birth or rank. The  government ought  to help, not hinder.  I  understand  that. That was my kind  of  platform.  I admired the governor with political guts  and I admired the President with vision and  faith and creative action. I began to think  about maybe running for governor when I  came of age, and that I would have political   courage, and I would be creative to make  things better.  As I observed  these lasting political les sons, I was in high school. I might not have  gone to college except Presbyterian Junior  College was only six miles away and there  were not any jobs anyhow, and then word  filtered ba.ck to Laurinburg that at the state  university they would give you a job and lend  you money to pay your way through college.  Some years  later, when  I was governor,  all of this was an inde.Uble part of my atti tudes. For one example, I knew we must have  the tools for building people. The Community  College  system with  technical  institutes  within reach of every citizen of the state is,  I contend, one of the most far-reaching ac~  complishments of my term as governor of  North Carolina.. Almost 60 institutions, with  almost 200,000  enrolled  today,  came  into  being, and maybe already a million North  Carolina people have  been  enriched  and  given the opportunity to advance their lives.  We paid for  them too, and a  lot of other  things that have helped people. Some leaders  with vision would only have dreamed and  talked, but it takes political courage, a will ingness  to  risk unpopularity,  in order  to  serve bes1t.  .1405  had a  So:m~h,~w ~~~~ . Ehrin~~a,'l'!s~ legisl'""tUJ;&tJ ..  had nibbled away at the sa.J.es tax, With ex emption after exemption added, untU we  tax both hard to administer and one  that failed to meet the needs of the ci-tizens  of North Carolina. Some of my closest ad visors urged great dreams and little action,  that I would have no political future if I  removed the sales tax exemptions. My answer  was tha.t I did not come to the Governor's  Office to build a political future.  It is not my nature to brag, but the polit ical guts to pay for what we get, demon strated by Governor Ehringhaus, and  the  political vision to put our faith in people,  demonstrated by President Roosevelt, were  high school lessons I learned well and have  not forgotten.  The problem in America today is not so  much that we 1,1,eed a political platform of  things to do. We need the spirit and the will   and  the self-reliance. We need  leadership  with guts an4 vi~ion.  one chief reason I am running is that I  feel so strongly that it is outrageous that we  have  a  government  policy  that  tightens  money to create unemploYm.ent. A man~ job .  is his right, if he does it well and properly.  Our policy is wrong. It is like the old Hoover  days. I would put into effect immediately a  full employment policy, which means that  government will be using its efforts to pro~  mote productive jobs in private enterprise.  We do not need forced unemployment to stop  inflation. We can handle both by the full use  of our productive capacity, by a balanced fed eral budget in ordinary times, by lower in terest rates, to name a few of the paths the  government can follow.  This country has never had a  full em ployment policy. Our economic policy has  never put people first. It can be done. We can  work toward the time when every person who  wants to work can get a  job.  Full employment will reduce some of the  causes of crime. Full employment will help  stop drug abuse. Full employment will help  eliminate slums and ghettos. Fu:l employ ment will reduce discrimination. Full em ployment will give us a chance to reform the  welfare program. All this can be done with  proper leadet~hip.  Bi-g Washington government needs  to be  shaken and jolted. I'm capable of doing th~.  We  are  over-regulated. One  agency will  threaten to close your business  if you do  something, and another is likely to threaten  a fine if you do not. Washington is regula tion gone wild. They spy, investigate, prepare  needless guidelines, and forget all about the  taxpayro~ who pay them. We need someone  to take charge of Washington that is not a  part of Washington. That is one reason I  think a former Governor or North Carolina  ought to be running for President.  Our President could have helped keep  down the cost of electricity, gas, heating oil,  and gasoline. He didn't have to follow the  Arab states. But he did. If I were President,  I would want to be  the champion of the  people. I would have left on the lids to keep  down the price of lights and fuel.  I  am not in favor of taking gun!'; away  from ordinary citizens who do not commit  crimes, and I am in favor of  leaving  the  regulation of handguns  to  the states and  cities according to their needs and dangers.  There should be no national  law, which  would only require the creation of another  regulatory agency, although the federal gov ernment must regulate and control  inter state sale and transportation of handguns.  I would spread out the responsibility to  people through their cities and towns and  states. This  is ""working  federalism."" This  country is too vast and diverse to work under  one set of guidelines set up foil' both south ern California and Vermont, to apply equally  in North Carolina and North Dakota.

24,,94,-0.477,186,2,Mr. HARRINGTON.," Mr.  Speaker,  when our clients in Saigon and Phnom  Penh collapsed last spring, there was a  . widespread fear here in Wasl)ington that  the failure of U.S. policy in Southeast  Asia would lead to a firestorm of bitter ness and recrimination between Ameri cans. That prospect has clearly failed to  materialize-in fact, the exact opposite  seems to have occurred. The subject of  Indochina has been consigned to silence,  both by the general public and by those  most responsible for our long  involve ment there.  A sense of relief and a desire to move  on to other matters are certainly under standable after a decade of violence,  frustration, and division, but we do our;.  selves a great disservice, I  think, if we  to examine  fail  the meaning of  this  tragic experience. Unless we pause to re flect on Indochina and  to adjust our  , world view in accordance with its teach ings, we run the serious risk of repeating  such . blunders in the future. Although  the cases are not exactly parallel,  the  recent covert commitment of U.S. aid in  Angola seems  to indicate. that top ad ministration officials,  and particularly  the Secretary of State, have learned very  little from the past. Third world coun tries are still perceived as squares on the  superpowers' chessboard, and Congress  and the American public are still per ceived as avoidable nuisances when for eign policy is formulated.  Clearly the time has come for a na tional debate on the most fundamental  goais and assumptions of U.S.  foreign  policy, a debate that can give us a global  posture based on consensus instead of  furtive decree. Nobody has called for such  a debate more eloquently than Richard  Barnet, whose article in the January 17  issue of the New Republic deserves to be  read by every Member of Congress. Be ..  cause of its length, I am ipgerting this  excellent article in the R~conn in two  installments. The first segment follows:  THE GREAT . FOREIGN POLICY DEBATE WE  OUGHT . TO BE HAVING  (By Richard J. Barnet)  Six months  after  the worst defeat  in  American history the great debate on what  went wrong in Indochina has yet to happen.  Janua1y 28, 1976  Like the ""bloodbath'.'. in Vietnam, the ""orgy  of  recrimination""  in America has  turned  out to .be official hyperbole. Instead of the  ""wave of McCarthyism"" so widely predicted  by administration officials, there is a bipal' tisan silence. Vietnam is ""behind us,"" Presi dent For'd proclaims, and no one wants to  look back.  In most countries' a 20-year war costing  over $150 billion, 55,000 battlefield deaths,  and lasting damage to the economy would  not be written off so easily. Ordinarily gen erals who lose battles are dismissed. In par liamentary  democracies  governments  that  lose wars expect to fall. In the US the archi tects of the final disaster are still in power.  . Far from reexamining the world view that  led a generation of American  leaders, and  the rest of us with them, into the famous  quagmire,  they  have  rededicated  them selves-and us-to that same world view.  There  is an eeri'e quality of deja vu  to  the major post-Vietnam national  security  initiatives. Mayaguez (echoes of the Gulf of  Tonkin); nuclear threats in Korea  (shades  of Gen. MacArthur);  a  proposed military  spending program  that  locks  the country  into five years of escalating budgets (a replay  of the Kennedy buildup of the early 1960s);  renewed threats 'of military intervention in  the Persian Gulf (memories of the Domini can Republic and Vietnam).  The official lesson of Vietnam, it seems, is  that America's global defense perimeter must  be  redrawn,  alliances  cemented  and  the  threat of American military power, includ ing nuclear weapons, made more credible.  The  foreign policy debate,  to  the extent  there is one at all, is about where to draw  the new defense line and what weapons to  use? Should Turkey keep its honorary mem bership in the free world? How much pres sure should be put on Portugal? How fast  should the US stand in Korea? But there is  no challenge to either the vision of American  or the vision of international politics that  inspired  five American Presidents  to  risk  and lose in Indochina.  The discussion on foreign policy is taking  place within narrow limits because the par ticipants on all sides basically accept  the  same world view. There is a tacit agreement.  as to the goals America <>hould be pursuing.  in  international politics,  , shared  assump tions about what is happimh'lg in the world,  and a common faith about what American  power can do.  Basically the discussion of current Ameri can foreign policy since the debate in Indo china  accepts  uncritically  the  cold war  model of reality. America's goal remains as  President Johnson stated  it:  ""We are  the  number one nation and we are going to stay  the number one nation."" Despite detente,  the central threat to the peace is still the  Soviet Union. Soviet power must be con tained  by maintaining  superior  nuclear  forces and projecting conventional military  might  through alliances, military aid ar rangements and  foreign ,bases. The world  must be made as safe as possible for Ameri can economic growth by discouragilig or  aborting  anti-capitalist  revolutions wher ever  possible. American  economic  power  must be employed to counter efforts of the  nonindustrialized  countries  to  alter  the  present international economic system.  The most  fundamental  assumptions of  American foreign policy are beyond debate  within government because tlie bureaucra cies  charged with making policy depend  upon them for their survival. It is not for  the air force to question whether ""national  security"" requires keeping the foreign bases  acquired in the 1950s or for the CIA to q\tes tion whether American  interests must be  served by clandestine or paramilitary opera tions in the Third World. Bureaucracies keep  doing what they do. To overcome bureau cratic inertia requires deliberate choices to  ",1976
25,,94,0.416,199,2,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, yester day's Washington Star carried an edi torial by William Safire which may serve  to jog the consciences of my fairminded  colleagues on the other side. I commend  it all to fairminded, thinking people:  KENNEDY-ERA ISSUES ARE ALL IN THE FAMILY  1965  (By William Safire)  Mafia mobsters and Kennedy mythkeepers  can  heave  sighs  of  relief;  Sen.  Frank  Church's cover-up committee has decided  not to question Frank Sinatra on his role  in making possible the first penetration of  the White House by organized crime. Nor  will Church ask the FBI to investigate the  first murder of a prospective Senate witness.  The reason can be found in the way the  committee staff was organized. Church first  asked John Doar, fresh  from  impeachme.nt  triumphs, for advice. After peopling the com mittee staff with members of the Kennedy  protective society, Doar recommended Burke  Marshall (the lawyer Ted Kennedy called in  his panic from Chappaqulddick) , who told  Church he would serve as a consultant re cruiting suitable  lawyers, and who recom mended F. A. 0. ""Fritz"" Schwarz Jr. to be  staff chief.  Count the connections. Schwarz is a part ner of Cravath, Swaine and Moore, the New  York law firm that represents IBM. Marshall,  a Kennedy assistant attorney general, was  mM general  counsel  from  to  Nicholas Katzenbach, Kennedy deputy attor ney general,  followed him as  IBM general  counsel, working  closely with Schwarz at  Cravath, Roswell Gilpatrlc, Kennedy deputy  defense secretary, is the top man at Cravath.  Now count the cover-ups.  1. The Ramsey Clark-John Doar cover-up.  As the Church committee blamed J. Edgar  Hoover for abuses under Kennedy and John son, no spotlight was focused on the infa mous Sept. 27, 1967, memo from Asst. Atty.  Gen. Doar to his boss, Ramsey Clark.  In  the Doar plan,  approved by Clark,  snooping on dissident groups was raised to a  fine art; Doa.r urged that the IRS be used,  especially  its alcohol unit in ghetto areas,  and went on: ""The Narcotics Bureau is an other possibility, and finally, my experience  in Detroit suggests that the Post Office De partment might be helpful."" Doar was never  called; Clark was never asked to explain. But  CIA men are facing grand juries now about  their postal ""experiences.""  2. The Katzenbach coverup. Robert Ken nedy's deputy and  successor  angrily de manded a  retraction when I  suggested he  condoned  the scandalous wiretapping and  bugging of Martin Luther King, Jr., but he  professed  to amazement when  later con fronted with his initials and handwriting on  scurrilous eavesdropping reports.

26,,94,-0.589,212,2,Mr. YOUNG of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  it has now been over five years since the  passage of  the Postal Reorganization  Act, a move by Congress which estab lished  the U.S.  Postal Service  as  a  quasi-independent agency,  in hopes of  improving America's mail delivery systern by making it more efficient and selfsustaining.  Embodied in this act was the feeling  that the U.S. Postal Service would be  both a public service and a self-support ing corporation-two theories which we  are currently .witnessing as  incompatible.  It appears  that in  its efforts  to  obtain the status of self-supportive, the  U.S. Postal Service management has in stead led its clientele, which includes al [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, 1976]  PLIGHT OF THE WrrNESSES  Stories have been trickling out of Africa  during the past several months recounting  the rellgious persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Malawi.

28,Senate,94,-0.408,277,2,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, housing,  more than any other sector of the econ omy, has suffered during the current re cession. The housing slump began before  the broader recession, went deeper than  the economy overall, and responded more  slowly in the w~ak recovery. Moreover,  inflation in housing costs  is such that  the expectations of American families  with respect to the sort of housing they  can afford-whether renting or buying are constantly being eroded.  The reality of housing inflation calls  into question a basic assumption about  our society; namely, that we as a na-tion  are over time growing more prosperous.  The fact is that in recent years the pro portion of American families  that can  afford to buy homes has been diminish ing.  In  one-third of  the Nation's  households could afford to purchase a  median-priced house. In 1975, an income  of $20,000 was needed to qualify for a  conventional mortgage on a median priced new home; only one-fifth of the  families in the country had this much  income. This trend must be reversed. The  obvious  implications are intolerable.  For  the millions of households who  because of the size of their incomes must  rent, rather than buy, the proportion of  their incomes which they must spend on  rent  is constantly increasing. In 1960,  according to the Census of Housing, the  median proportion of income spent on  rent fell in the 15-19 percent range.  In 1973, the proportion had risen to  20 to 24 percent. The Census of Housing  shows only the numbers of households  within  given  rent-to-income  ranges.  Spiraling inflation in rental costs is due  to increases in the cost of maintenance,  construction and mortgage costs, and  most importantly rising utility charges.  We must address ourselves to this prob lem.  Ironically,  in  the midst of a major  housing slump, the Nixon and Ford ad ministrations have relied almost exclu sively on restrictive monetary policy to  fight  inflation. This policy pursued by  the Federal Reserve Board with  the  blessing of  the Republicans has com pounded  the rise  in mortgage  interest  rates due to inflation. In theory, restric tive monetary policy is said to be non selective; in fact, the high mortgage in terest rates stemming from such policy  have resulted in selective credit alloca tion  the detriment of  the housing  market.1  For families trying to purchase a home,  even a small increase in interest rates  means a substantial increase in monthly  mortgage payments.

36,House,94,0.218,368,2,Mr. CLEVELAND.," Mr.  the  gentleman  from California  (Mr.  KETCHUM).  Mr. KETCHUM .. Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in opposition  to H.R. 5247. When the  House passed this measure last May, au thorizing $5 billion without fiscal year  limitation to fully fund certain State and  local public works projects, I maintained  that I would share no part in this ""pork  banel"" legislation. I do not quarrel with  the stated intent of this bill-to create  jobs, stimulate the economy, and eventu ally produce more revenue to balance a  bloated Federal budget. The problem is  this  bill will produce none of  these  salutary goals, but rather will eventually  add to inflationary pressures, reduce the  amount of capital available to businesses,  and create an  intolerable amount of  deficit in the Treasury.  It is a false assumption to believe that  this bill will cure unemployment. In the  first place, past experience with public  works projects has shown the invariable  need for long lead time before commenc ing on a project, so that the 90-day on~  site labor requirement will prove illusory.  The result being that most of the funds  approp1iated will be spent during a time  when the economy is experiencing sub stantial growth, and would consequently  be detrimental to the recent slowdown  in the inflation rate. Second, we are not  giving anyone meaningful, full-time jobs.  There is little promise that this bill will  alleviate unemployment to any signifi cant degree, but  it  is  certain  to add  enormously to the national problem of  inflation,  since  the program will  be  financed by more deficit spending. The  public works program before us now  continues a bankrupt policy of directly  allocating Federal funds  to the public  sector to create jobs. This is the intended  purpose of the general revenue sharing  program, to support essential services of  State and local governments, providing  the opportunity for local goven1ments  to allocate Federal funds to the most de serving programs, without the interven tion of Washington officials who are out  of touch with the needs and priorities  of  individual cities and co-unties. This  bill would only dUplicate this process at  the expense of adding  to our already  massive deficit.  If our Government  is  already making  a  strong attempt  create jobs and if this effort is not work ing,  then existing programs should be  reviewed and improved before any effort  is made to create a new program, espe cially one which does not even require  that funds be spent to create jobs.  We have before us a bill which author izes $6.2 billion, which the Government  does not have,  to create a 100-percent  federally financed program for State and  local go-vernment construction projects.  This lunatic method of solving our un employment is exactly .what we do not  need. What is essential are some  true  and effective solutions which will really  solve our national economic problems.  We must return to a balanced budget.  We must encourage capital formation by  private industry which will create per manent, meaningful  jobs. That is  the  program we need, and I only hope that  to  'should the conference report to this bill  pass, the President will veto it on the  principle that more Government spend ing and more inflation can never cure  what such policies have already caused a period of massive recession.

37,House,94,0.378,368,2,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, last  May,  this House passed a public works  employment bill, hoping to give our sput tering economy a shot in the arm. The  argument then was that recession was  more of a peril than inflation. Well. since  that time several things have happened.  The economy turned the corner, the un employment rate went down, and this  bill, which had left the House with a  price tag of $5 billion, went to the limbo  ef a conference committee.  Now it is before us again, 8 months  later and millions of dollars higher. Never  mind  that the fiscal year  is all over.  Never mind there is no way this money  could get into the market in an orderly  fashion  in  time  to do  the mosi good.  Never mind that the Pr sident has prom ised to veto it.  Face it, gentlemen, this bill is not the  answer. It is the old political pork barrel  wrapped up in a new package. And just  in  time  to kick off everyone's election  campaign.  As though that were not bad enough,  the Senate has compounded  the error  by adding a new title to the bill, a title  which provides for neither public works  nor employment-but which will cost the  taxp yers another billion and a half dol lars.  Mr. Chairman, Congress has already  appropriated $2.5 billion this year under  CETA and  the Emergency Jobs Act money which will go to State and local  governments to create public service jobs.  In addition, we passed a tax cut exten sion designed to keep the economy go ing, and to stimulate local and Sta.te rev enues. We have extended unemployment  benefits. And we will soon be asked to ex tend and increase the Federal revenue shaling program.  \Vhy then are we passing this bill? It  seems clear to me that this bill, and title  II in particular,  totally misdirected.  The stated intention of  title n, is  to  institute a new concept in Federal aid named countercyclical aid. The idea be ing  that State and  local governments  need a periodic handout in order to off set the revenue losses they experience in  a  recession.  Yet  local  governments,  which would receive two-thirds of these  ,new dollars, derive 82 percent of their  revenues  not  from  recession-related  sources such as sales and income taxes,  but from property taxes.    It  is not  recession-related. drD~s in  revenue which are killing the cities, it. is  skyrocketing costs for services, caused by  inflation-and inflation i.s what will hap pen with this bill.

38,House,94,-0.597,381,2,Ms. ABZUG.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of this conference report  on which I was a House conferee. We  are a Nation that is still in a deep re cession. When we passed the House ver sion of H.R. 5247 last May, I urged sup port for the measure by noting the high  unemployment figures in States through out the country. I reg1et to say that a  review of those unemployment figures re veals a continuation of  the same un fortunate conditions, despite the claims  of the Ford administration. In California,  the unemployment rate  is 9.6 percent.  The Massachusetts rate is 11.3 percent,  Michigan is suffering from 12.2 percent  unemployment. Pennsylvania is experi encing an 8.7 percent rate, Alabama's  figure is 3.6 percent, Oregon has 9.9 per cent unemployed. r.rhe list of States with  similar figures  is,  sadly, very  long. A  number of  industries, particularly  the  construction industry are in a desperate  situation.  T)le  impact of H.R. 5247  is, simply  stated,  to put hundreds of  thousands  of people to work. In the process, we will  increase public  revenues and decrease  our. welfare rolls. Those who argue that  this Federal commitment would be in ftationary should remember  that Con gressional Budget Office  studies  show  that for every percentage point decrease  in unemployment in excess of 4 percent,  there is a resultant decrease of $2 billion  in Government expenditures and a $14  billion increase in Federal tax revenues.  It is much inore productive to put peo ple back on payrolls doing the necessary  work of this Nation,  than to continue  spending $30 billion on unemployment  insurance, food stamps, and other unem ployment benefit programs.  Neither should we overlook the public  In  5247  sector needs that the public works pro gram will fulfill. This program will build  hospitals, schools, court houses, high ways,  airports  that  are  immediately  needed. Local gcvernment has not had  the ability to pay for these facilities, cer tainly not in these difficult and often des perate days of recession, and the con comitant  lessened  local  tax  revenues  that recession has brought. How many  communities are  in desperate need of  sewers, storm drains, libraries, and com munity facilities? How many communi ties could use the shot in the arm that an  additional 400,000 jobs would bring?  ",1976
39,House,94,-0.396,381,2,Mr. ADAMS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise at this  time to advise the House on the status  of the pending legislation, H.R. 5247, the  Public Works Employment Act, under  the congressionally adopted budget ceil ings for fiscal 1976.  In setting the fiscal 1976 budget ceil ings,  the conferees on the second con gressional resolution provided $9.5 billion  in budget authority and $7 billion in out lays for the community and regional de velopment  function.  setting  these  levels,  the managers stated in the con ference report that $3.9 billion in budget  authority and $1 billion in outlays was  provided for the public works and anti recession assistance legislation contained  in H.R. 5247.  The actual fiscal 1976 impact of H.R.  is now estimated to be below the  levels provided in the second congres sional resolution on the budget. The leg islation authorizes that there be appro priated only $3.5 billion in budget au thority in fiscal 1976. Outlays from these  appropriations, if Congress subsequently  fully funds these programs, are estimated  to be no more than $600 million in fiscal  1976. Thus, the potential cost of this leg islation is $400 milliun in budget author ity and outlays below the levels set for  it in our present ceilings for  the fiscal  year.  I would also point out, Mr. Speaker,  that the spending targetc; which the Con gress has established for this year's tran sition period also assumes full funding  of the programs authorized in this legis lation.  Finally, Mr. Speaker. I would remind  my colleagues that enactment of this leg islation and subsequent full funding of  the programs involved was a major as sumption underlying the overall economic  stimulus strategy embodied in the con gressional budget. The economic stimula tion, and particularly the resulting  job  creation,  to result from  this legislation  is essential if we are to achieve our goal  of recovery and continued growth.  Mr. WON PAT. Mr. Speaker, I urge  in the strongest sense possible that our  colleagues here in the House  join with  the Senate to approve the conference re port on H.R. 5247. Our fello rv Americans  have waited too long for the relief that  this measure offers. This country needs  immediate help in providing jobs for our  people. This is exactly what H.R. 5247  offers and I ask  that this measure be  sent to the President today with an over whelming show of support from the Con gress.  It is no secret that thousands of Anier icans are out of work. In my own congressional district of Guam, the unem ployment rate in recent months has shot  to over 14 percent. In less than a year,  our island ha.s turned from full employ ment to hard line unemployment. Unless  we act to put H.R. 5247 on the lawbooks,  families who now wonder if their Gov ernment really cares about them can ex pect little relief in the near future.  I believe that H.R. 5247 is living proof  that this Congress does care about job lessness and inflation. This outstanding  measure will, as you know, provide $2.5  billion to fund public work projects that  can provide immediate jobs for Ameri cans. Although this amount is less than  the $5 billion earlier asked by the House,  the money provided by  the conference  report represents a  significant step  in  the right direction toward providing our  people with the assistance they expect  from this Congress.  I  am particularly pleased  that  the  measure before us  today does not at tempt to fashion new directions in our  efforts  to solve  the Nation's economic  problems; rather it uses well established  paths which we lcnow work well. The re lief which H.R. 5247 is to bring is of an  immediate natme and this I wholeheart edly commend the decision of the chair man and members of  the Senate and  House Public Works Committee to use  this bill as a vehicle to fund the Depart ment of Commerce's excellent Economic  Development Administration.  Funds earlier voted last year to fund  title X of EDA served to pay for a re forestation project on Guam which em ploys 30 persons. But Guam has addi tional grant requests amounting to over  $2 million which have yet  to be ap proved. H.R. 5247 also authorizes $500  million for title X which I sincerely urge  this Congress to authorized and to ap propriate at the earliest possible oppor tunity.  I appreciate that what we do here to day will create severe problems with our  own  efforts  to maintain an  effective  budget. Undoubtedly, we will also be op posed by the White House in this mat ter. I sincerely hope, however, that H.R.  5247 will be permitted to serve its in tended purpose and not become the un willing victim of partisan politics. The  world's richest nation surely has the eco nomic resources to provide jobs for its  people at a  time when they need them  most.  ",1976
40,House,94,-0.023,381,2,Mr. CONTE.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  pleased to rise in support of the Local  Public Works Capital Development and  Investment Act (H.R. 5247).  The unemployment  situation across  the Nation is not as severe as it had been  several months ago but the rate is still  less  than desirable.  In all  these past  months, we have seen every legislative  attempt to stimulate the economy. We  saw an attempt to give  tax credits  to  business,  tax cuts which affected only  those employed,  increasing unemploy ment compensation benefits, we saw sub sidies for rents, we saw beefing up  the  Comprehensive  Educational  Training  Act-CET A-which is the only measure  which proved to be marginally effective.

44,House,94,-0.304,407,2,Mr. HAYS of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, I find  myself in a bit of a dilemma on this. My  friend, En KocH, and I were discussing it  at lunch and both of us agreed, and we  may vote it opposite ways, that what we  are being asked to do is vote on the re port  in  the dark or  let  the President  censor it. Neither of us liked that situa tion. It seemed to us that the ideal sit uation would be to have the report and  then go  into executive session like the  Senate does and then debate it and then  vote, and then vote whether to release  it or not, or whether  to  release some  parts of it.  I think we are put in a very untenable  position. I probably will vote not to re lease it, because I do not know what is  in it.  On the other hand let me say it has  been leaked page by page, sentence by  sentence, paragraph by paragraph, and  drop by drop to the New York Times,  but I suspect, and I do not know and  this is what disturbs me, that when this  report comes out it is going to be the big gest nonevent since Brigitte Bardot, af ter 40 years and four husbands and nu merous lovers, held a press conference to  announce that she was no longer a virgin.  . ",1976
45,House,94,0.012,407,2,Mr. MILFORD.," Mr. Speaker, we have  had  several comments  from our col leagues about the nine great Americans  on the Select Committee on Intelligence  who have voted for the release of the  report. And I agree with them those men  are indeed nine great America~.  I am one of the four nongreat Ameri cans on that committee. And I would like  to correct one impression that has been  put forward concerning the opinions of  the four nongreats.  First of all, not a single one of us was  opposed to conducting this investigation.  Indeed we wanted it done. We wanted it  done in every int~mate detail.  Mr. Speaker,  the only  thing we are  concerned about is that we do not want  to announce our intelligence secrets to  the world.  Furthermore everyone of these classi fied details that we are conce1~ned with,  and most of  them are mere  technical  details, could be eliminated from  this  report and it would not change a single  thing. It would not cover up a single act  or item.  The problem, and  it  is  a  practical  problem  that we have been facing,  is  that no one on this committee and no  one on  the committee staff had any  expertise  in  intelligence  technicalities.  What is in dispute here is  intelligence  technicalities. When the House Members  read that report, most are not going to be  able themselves to recognize these intel ligence details. However, an experienced  intelligence analyst, with our adversaries,  will  find  the  report  to be  a  virtual  bonanza.  That  is all we are concerned with.  Every one of these technical details could  be eliminated without harming a single  thing. As has been stated here, and I  plead to the House, all that the Young  amendment is doing is forcing it to be  published initially as a classified docu ment. We will all get a copy of it. All  we have to do  is sit down and read it  ourselves and, if we think it should be  made public or  this House  thinks  it  should be made public,  it will  take a  simple  resolution  to publish  it  to  the  world.  The real issue involved here, the real  gut issue, is: ""Can nine Members of this  House unilaterally  release  information  that could be damaging to this Nation?""  You see, once it is published, it is kind  of like the fellow jumping off the Empire  State Building and wanting to change  his mind halfway down. It simply cannot  be done.  My friends, I plead that we vote for the  Young amendment.  The argument has been made that Since much of the report has already been  leaked to the press, we might as well turn  the rest loose.  That argument should be rejected for  two good reasons: First, the American  press is not an official organ or spokes man for the U.S. Government; the Con gress, or an official congressional report  is. Second, ""official"" acknowledgement of  certain past or present intelligence ac tivities can seriously damage foreign re lations by forcing some countries to take  unpleasant  reactions  that  otherwise  could be avoided.  While it is true that a large part of the  report has already been leaked  to  the  press and,  if every Member is given a  copy, undoubtedly much more of  the  report will be leaked. The leaks will in volve sensational or scandalous types of  information. I am not concerned with  these matters.  My concern deals with a number of  classified technical details that are scat tered  throughout  the  report.  These  technical details will not make good  headlines and will largely be ignored by  the press. These same technical details  will be a virtual bonanza for our adver saries' intelligence analysts.  By far, the greatest danger in publicly  releasing the report would stem from the  damage it would cause in our foreign re lations with certain countries.  Relations with underdeveloped coun tries or politically unstable countries are  at best an extremely difficult problem.  The committee report will seriously ag gravate  these problems and may seri ously harm the interest of the United  States.  Many of  these countries are vital to  our Nation's welfare. Some produce and  sell vital natural resources needed for  our industries. Others are strategically  vital for our economic well-being and  our national defense. Normal diplomatic  ",1976
46,,94,-0.336,459,2,Mr. BONKER.," Mr. Speaker,  in con junction with our consideration of a new  security assistance package,  the House  International Relations Committee was  privileged  recently  to hear  testimony  from several senior Government officials  who administer the Foreign Assistance  Act and the Foreign Military Sales Act.

48,,94,0.336,537,2,Mr. STEIGER of Wisconsin.," Mr.  Speaker,  last session I entered  in  the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD many criticisms  concerning the inaccurate nature of the  reported debates in the RECORD. As I said  on  several occasions,  these criticisms  were not directed  to  the Government  Printing Office or the Official Reporters  of Debates, who do extraordinarily good  work on our behalf.  I have met with the GPO and there porters on the proposal to use a distinc tively different typeface for inserted ma terial (H.R. 568, 589, 570, 581, and 630)  and  they have been cooperative and  helpful.  The 70-odd House cosponsors of these  resolutions felt that a bracket would be  more economical than different typeface  and agreed with this change proposed by  Senator CANNON,  the then chairman of  the Joint Committee on Printing, and  Mr. Thomas F. McCormick, the Public  Printer. The matter is still before  the  Joint Committee on Printing. Senator  Bos PACKWOOD, author of an identical  Senate proposal, and I are meeting with  the staff of  the Joint Committee and  representatives of the GPO in the near  future.  I would like  to call the attention of  the Members to an article in the Janu ary 1976 issue of ""Government Execu tive"" which indicates that the GPO, un der Mr. McCormick, has made signifi cant efforts in improving management,  reducing costs, and increasing productiv ity,  including an effort  to  reduce  the  number of typefaces:  GPO: AGGRESSIVELY  Iv'"".lARKETING THEm  UNIQUE SERVICES  The  Government  Printing  Office,  for  decades an introverted, sometimes arrogant  entity surrounded by a self-generated aura  of mysterious controls and authority, is go ing through a complete 1eversal in pEUson ality.  It is working more effectively with  the  private sector printing industry, improving  its own productivity in large bites and ac tively seeking out  the rest of  the  federal  structure with details on its operations and  how to do better with less money.  Part o:f the change is due to Public Printer  Thomas F. McCormick, an experienced ex ecutive who is demonstrating an ability to  is  to  labor inten reports,  bills  move his organization while capably han dling the demands of his overseers, the U.S.  Congress.  A cum  laude graduate  in business from  Holy Cross College, a Navy veteran and a vet eran of the  financial management  ladders  of General Electric, McCormick was tapped  for his current position shortly after a four year stint running a large G.E. printing sub sidiary.  Just prior  joining GPO on March 1,  1973, he was managing G.E.'s Power Genera tion Strategy Development,  concentrating  on long-range planning.  In a business where deadlines are routine,  McCormick has opened  the GPO rapidly setting up communications  links between  the organization and all interested outsiders.  And his major thrust is to substantially im prove government printed media while keep ing cost effective.  Much of what GPO does  sive-congressional hearings,  and the like.  The  two major publications handled by  the GPO a.re  the Congressional Record and  the Federal Register. ""The  typesetting for  both of these is, on a daily basis, capable of  filling the news sections of six daily metro politan newspapers.""  The GPO is the largest hot lead typesetting  house in the world. Hundreds of casting ma chines work out huge volumes daily. But the  GPO is moving to electronic and photo com position  techniques. They are  into optical  scanning systems and are continually ex panding.  ''It is my estimate,"" says McCormick, ""that  by 1980 we will have very little hot metal  composition in house. There will always be a  need for some of this.""  And McCormick is anticipating-attrition,  retraining and other aspects are constantly  examined, in order to move as fairly as pos sible over the next several years.  McCormick, in the short time he has been  aboard GPO, has actively encouraged a host  of productivity  improvements. Many have  come through mechanization and systema tizing of lines-again primarily in the move ment and distribution of materials.  ""We  are  focusing  on productivity,  the  whole emphasis is on this. There is a great  need for  it, and, equally, many opportuni ties.""  One approach is in ma.nagement training GPO now has an in-house effort and every  manager, from top down to first line super visors have been run through it to acquaint  them with the basics of management think ing and techniques.  ""We have put together a productivity op elation-brought in some new, young people  into the comptroller's shop to develop meas urement approaches. They have made some  significant  improvements  in  some minor  areas but hopefully,  they will branch out  into the major areas-specifically the dis tribution side of  the house where we are  filling orders, handling cash, warehousing  and other non-printing activities.""  Very careful about setting standards, Mc Cormick notes that just the mere developing  of productivity measurements has resulted in  a productivity rise.  Among other things, GPO is now operating  a publications receipt and control system.  This system keeps track of all of the GPO's  27,000 items on line and interactively. And  with this system. McCormick feels the GPO  has pretty good control over its bulk inven tory.  The next step is to automate the order ful~  fillment process so that a complete record is  kept, and available, on the status of any or  de1 in house.  McCormick is busy broadening both indus try and gove1'Ilment knowledge of the func tions, purpose and moves of the GPO. Be  regards the attention of the printing indusit  try on GPO as fully legitimate and works  with them-through their associations and  various organizations.  Though he is involved in it, he says the  g~owing use of more effective graphic design  in government printed media. is primarily  th €' work of the National Endowment For  The Arts and Nancy Hanks.  The GPO has courses on printing produc tion for federal editors and a separate set  fo.r designers.  ""There is a  terrific potential for savings  in government printing in standardization,""  says McCormick, ""and the Labor Dept, is a  prime example."" The idea is to get away from  settling in on sizes and formats peculiar to  government and so set up these to reflect the  ability in the private sector. ""It makes  morf' competitive and has a solid cost cut ting e1Iect.""  Labor had nearly 50 different trim sizes which severely limited the GPO's ability to  produce or produce publications economic ally. Labor's plan will result in the use of  four basic trim sizes, four typefaces and four  types of paper.  There are countless ways to reduce gov e!.'nment printing costs and most start right  in  the originating  agency. Early  contact  with the GPO can be a tremendous help. (So  can internal discipline-author's alterations,  which  is re-writing  inside of the printing  cyc!P-, cost more than $3.7 million in 1974.)  There is an unkillable myth that the GPO  does all government printing or wants  to  control all government printing.  Actually, almost 70% of the dollar printing  volume handled by the GPO is done, under  contract, in the private sector. In FY '74 this  amounted to more than $222 million and it  will be higher in the current year.  McCormick wants to raise the dollar value  on  individual  jobs  to allow agencies more  leeway  in handling  small  jobs. Anything  above a certain amount must go .through the  GPo-the problem is that inflation and ma terials costs raises over the years has rendered  this lower limit far too low.  As McCormick looks at it, the theory be hind a centralized production and/or pro curement function is to increase efficiencies.  For instance, the GPO's in house production  is primarily devoted  to Congress. But this  has its ups and downs. By having most gov ernment printing coming through the GPO,   we  ca.n  decide,  based  on our  loadings,  whether it is more efficient to do it in housa  or farm it out.""  In addition, the GPO has a body of highly  skilled printing procurement specialists un matched by any other government agency.  Writing printing specifications is a technical  task and it is always costly to the non~expert.  McCormick  also  sends  team  to any  .agency, on request, to run a one-day seminar  on what the GPO is all about. ""And the at tendees cover all interested parties-not just  the editor or the p1inting specialists.""  The seminars, just moving out of the ex perimental stages,  touch on all aspects of  the problem-standardization, building  in  :flexibility, late changes, quality control, de liver'T elements and distribution alternatives.  Even the very basic question as to should  there be any printing at all in a specific ca::e  is addressed-this is the microform conver sion area where moving to film in the first  place could create savings, increase commu nications and still allow the generation of  ""hard copy"" if needed.  Since the late sixties,  there has been a  growing shift in moving government print ing, through the GPO, into the private sec tor instead o:f doing it all in-house. McCor mick estimates that GPO produces or con tracts for about a half billion dollars annu ally in printing and allied services. ""Yet there  are over 300 agency printing plants doing an  estimated equal amount in dollar '\'olume.""  a.  ",1976

Besides the celebrated Russian dissi dents who are awakening  the world's  conscience, we have a new case in point  in the leaders of the National Councils of  Hungarian  and German Workers  in  Romania.  According  to  the very authoritative  West German daily, the Frankfurter All gemeine Zeitung o:f November 11, 1975,  these  leaders, mostly  nominal  party  members and handpicked candidates of  President Ceaucescu and the Romanian  Communist Party to lead the 2.5 million  Hungarian and 600,000 German origin  citizens  in Romania have accused the  government of  discrimination  against  their communities and asked for reme dial action by the government and also  the establishment of a  ''Transylvanian  Commission"" at the U.N. Human Rights  Commission.  In view of the Provisions of the Ro manian Constitution making ""chauvin ist-nationalist agitation'~ a crime and the  past practices of the police,  the mem orandum  took great personal courage.  It is notable that the demands of the  memorandum were substantially  iden tical with the areas of concern outlined  in our letter to President Ford which I  and 38 colleagues signed on July 22, 1975,  before  the  President's departure  Bucharest.  It is an eloquent  testimony  to  the  solid popular suppo1t these leaders en joy in their respective communities that  even President Ceaucescu,. plagued by  economic inefficiency, :floods and low pro ductivity rates while ambitiously trying  to expand industry failed to proceed with  secret police means. Rather, he appeared  at their annual convention, appealed to  their commitment as Ma-rxist-Leninist.:;,  emphasized that only higher production  rates and devotion to ideology can solve  the  national  question  and  admitted  shortcomings. He even promised some  remedies at the coming Cultural Congress  to  in 1977.  At the same  time. however, he also  warned against ""chauvinist-nationalist  manifestations"" which cannot be toler ated. He even referred indil'ectJ:y to the  activities of my colleagues in the House  and the Senate who had denounced last  year the oppression of Romanian citi zens, particularly those of non-Romanian  mother tongues and the actions of the  American Hungarian Federation and the  American Hungarian Reformed Church  who have submitted the case to the Hu-.  man Rights Commission of  the  'u.:;;;j""_  ",1976

Mrs. Duling objects to  the lowering of standards in any way to  'accommodate  the di1Ierences between  male and female. She also asserts tht'  general  public was  unaware  that  a  change in the law was contemplated.  There being no objection, the letter  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  (From the Daily Local News, Nov. 4, 1975]  AN ARGUMENT AGAINST NEW LAW ALLOWING  WOMEN IN MILITARY ACADEMIES  Editor News: I want to call to the atten tion of all voters the law passed by Congress  and signed by our President on Oct. 9, 1975,  No. 94-106.  This  law  carries  a  rider  Section  803  stating that our three major mllltary acad  emies: Army, Navy and Air Force, MUST  ""INSURE"" that women will be accepted in  this coming class entering July 1976.  The law states that their training is to  be ""the same as"" the men except for the  minimum .   . adjustments  in  standards  required  because  of  physiological  differ ences.''  It is difficult to communicate the conse quences of this action. My husband and I  have entertained mids and cadets specifically  three  times a year in our home since the  fall of 1971 and any other week-end that a  graduate or under-graduate was  free and  wanted to visit. We have visited both acad emies many  times;  followed one midship man through his enthe four-year  training  experience and  are presently  following  a  cadet  through his.  I  still correspond with  these men and know their attitudes :tbout  the situation. Many of  the  first-classmen  (seniors)  tell me  they will never go back  if women are admitted.  This association has helped us understal""ld  the unique environment that exists at the  academies to produce the resulting gradu ates. It also assures me that though person ally  I had a high school experience  that  would have made it possible for me to pass  the entrance exams as a woman, there is no  way I could have survived ""the same"" train ing these young men experience.  In order to make ""minimum adjustments"",  there would have to be an alternate system  for  the women which would not be equal  and they would be going through a different  training and reaching supposedly the same  honor that the present graduates are receiv ing. To me, this is UNJUST.  When you have 40,000 men inquiring about  entrance  to West Point,  for example, and  300 women so far, and only room for about  1,435  appointments,  the Congress  forcing  them to take women will deny entrance to  50-80 young men who would qualify and  graduate able to perform any leadership po sition in the service; whereas,  the women,  due  to  these ""minimum"" differences, will  receive a limited training. Also, there Is the  JUST law forbidding them in combat roles:  This is as it should be for a ""Nation under  God"" and is consistent with the Bible-the  Book of our Courts.  The unique training received at the Acad emies is a combination of physiological, psy chological and academic pressure. To lower  these standards  in order  to accommodate  women is to substantially weaken the unique ness and therefore the results of the train ing as it presently exists.  The Department  of  Defense  testified  against this rider, the Academies were against  it and the cadets and midshipmen are against  the creating of a double standard in order  to accommodate the basic God-given differ ences between men and women.  To say women ought  to have anything  they want is irrational--on a level with men  demanding to have the right to give birth.  Sorry folks-argue with God, but face reality  and  realize  there are certain areas where  because of  the differences,  they are cate gorically disqualified. The Academies  fall  into this definition and should be exempt  from having Congress  force  them  to take  women.  There are existing programs already for  training women in appropriate capacities in  the services and a unique educational track  could be easily set up for them on a parallel  with the system of Aviation Cadets, the fore runner of  the Air Force Academy, which  would establish an elite officer corps to fulfill  their wants within the law.  I am appealing to you to write to your  Congressman or woman expressing your con cern  regarding entry of women  into our  service Academies against the best interests  of these institutions and the Nation at large.  Ask him/her  to do everything  in his/her  power to repeal Section 803 of this law.  Our Congressman, Richard Schulze, has  assured me he will read every letter he re ceives and  if enough people write it will  have an  influence on Congress considering  a repeal.  Write to:  Rep.

51,Senate,94,-0.269,641,2,Mr. MONTOYA.," Mr. President,  the  Janua.ry issue of SCience and Children,  a publication of  the National Science  Teachers Association, has an article by  Margaret Wohlberg, the curator of the  Los Alamos County Historical Museum  at Los Alamos, N. Mex., concerning the  development and history of the Los Ala mos Ranch School. This fine school used  its location to train students in nature  sciences, and its alumni have contrib uted  in exciting ways  to  the national  consciousness of ecology and conserva tion.  The goals of  the historic school are  still carried out in L-os Alamos, where the  public school system has benefited from  the experience of  the earlier private  school. Scientific research at Los Ala mos is not the exclusive prerogative of  the adults who work at the Los Alamos  Scientific Laboratory, as Ms. Wohlberg's  article clea.rly  illustrates. I  ask unani mous consent that the article be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  SCIENCE AT THE Los ALAMOS RANCH SCHOOL  Los Alamos, New Mexico, exists 40 miles  northwest of the capitol, Santa Fe, at an alti tude of 7400 feet. It lies on a plateau at the  base of an extinct volcanic crater  in  the  Jen1ez Mountains, a  southern extension of  the Rocky Mountains chain.  Los Alamos  is best known  today for  its  choice as the site for the completion of sci entific research and assembly of the world's  first atomic bomb in World War II, and of  today's internationally known Los Alamos  Scientific Laboratory with its research into  weaponry and peacetime uses of nuclear en ergy.  The study of science formally began in Los  Alamos as far back as 1918, with the opening  of the Los Alamos Ranch School. A college  preparatory school for wealthy teenaged boys,  it was  thought of as a  ""model of modern  education,"" situated as it was among clean,  fresh air, abundant wildlife, and  the geo logic, prehistoric, and historic  foundation  upon which New Mexico rests.  SURROUNDED  BY NATURE  The Ranch School was situated on an iso lated cattle, bean, and ""dude"" ranch. Its first  year of existence, 1917-18, the son of a United  Sta.tes  ambassador  and  several  local  boy  scouts were enrolled as ""students."" Founder  Ashley Pond II, son of a wealthy Detroit  family, envisioned his school as substituting  ""applied"" education for book learning. The  boys learned cowpunching and archaeology,  rope throwing, and astronomy, with the help  of  local cowboys,  forest  rangers, and field  archaeologists who instilled in them an un derstanding of the natural world. The 1917  brochure boasted that ""studying from books  is absolutely eliminated, but the boys dur ing their walks, climbs and riding have con  stantly instilled into them practical outdoor  instruction in all things of interest that na ture furnishes-as botany, mineralogy, ele mentary  forestry,  astronomy,  archaeology,  ethnology."" But id-eal as this was to a teen aged boy's health or spirit of adventure, how  to dehorn a cow or read the stars did not  qualify to most parents as sufficient back ground for entry into college or the family  business.  ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE  More of an  innovator and  idealist than  a practical educator or administrator, Pond  realized the need for a regular educational  ",1976
52,Senate,94,0.495,680,2,Mr. GARN.," I  thank the Senator.  Mr. President, I am in complete accord  with  the objectives of H.R. 6516,  the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act amend ments, which were intended to prohibit  discrimination in the granting of credit  on the basis of race, color, religion, na tional origin, and age. Although credit is  not a right, discrimination on the basis  of a person's membership in a group is  inimical to fundamental principles of fair  play.  There was not, however, hard evidence  presented during the committee hearings  that discrimination  in fact was being  practiced in the consumer or commercial  credit area. Some data was called to the  attention of  the committee  indicating  that discrimination has been practiced  in some areas of  the country in home  mortgage  lending. However,  recently  Congress has enacted a number of laws  to remedy that specific problem.  Representatives  of  senior  citizen  groups did testify that they had received  a steady flow of complaints from their  membership describing cases of credit  discrimination based solely on age. They  believe that the letters received by their  associations on this subject establish a  clear pattern of discrimination against  older persons by certain credit grantors.  On the other hand. the lenders and re tailers told the committee that very little  if any discrimination in the covered cate gories exists. The  industry points out  that it is not to their member's interest  to discriminate, except on a person's  ability and willingness to repay. It seems  that competition in the mal'ltetplace has  cleared up the historic discrimination in  consumer  credit granting which may  have existed in the past.  Although I do feel that the Consumer  Affairs Subcommittee and the full Bank ing Committee did a commendable job  in eliminating some of the more burden some provisions  in this  legislation, my  general  concern  throughout  the con sideration of this proposal has been that  the committee did not fully measure the  need for the legislation and benefits to  some consumers against the cost to both  the  industry and ultimately all con sumers. No matter how laudable the pur pose of consumer legislation or how ef fective its enforcement, there is always  the danger that a law will produce side  effects which may be harmful  to  the  general public.  One of the unintended and unfortu nate  side  effects  of  recent consumer  credit legislation has been that it is plac ing  too great a compliance burden on  small merchants who feel a sense of frus tration in trying to cope with regulations  which t.hey do not understand and for  ",1976
53,,94,0.246,706,2,Mr. FINDLEY.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  a  thoughtful commentary on the relation ship between  the Concorde supersonic  aircraft and NATO appeared in the Sun day Washington Post. Written by Ed ward N. Stirewalt, it reminds us all that  the decision  the U.S. Government will  soon make on Concorde landing rights  here  touch  issues far more  important  to Western civilization and its future.  than noise and air-quality considera tions, important as those are.  Our Government  should  authorize  Concorde  landings for  the reasons set  forth by Mr. Stirewalt. To reject land ings would set back  the  technological  interests of our close alli'es, France, and  Britain, put the West at a serious dis advantage with  the Soviet Union a.nd  create a serious breach in relations with  the French and British.  In fact, it would undobtedly impel the  United States  to resume work qui'ckly  on its own supersonic plane-a decision  which would intensify trans-Atlantic ill  will.  I provided one of  the votes, sever~!  years ago, that suspended work on the  SST in this country. I so voted for sev eral reasons: At that time Britain and  France had  jointly  invested about $2  billion in the Concorde project; they de served a chance to recover some of that  investment  before  the United States  moved  into  competition.  I  believed  February 2, 1976  strongly, as I do now, that U.S. policies  should encourage the development of ad vanced technology in Western Europe;  such is essential to strength and cohe sion in NATO.  In fact, when the U.S. space program  took form I urged, for those very reasons,  that it be broadened to include astro nauts and scientists from our principal  allies in NATO.  To me,  space  linkups with French,  German,  and  British  seemed more  worthy and promising than linkups with  Soviet cosmonauts.  That did not occur, of course, but the  United States now has the opportunity  to give a boost to our relationships with  our close friends, Britain and France, by  welcoming the Concorde to our airfields.  I urge your attention to  the text of  Mr. Stirewalt's article, as published in  the February 1 Post:  THE CONCORDE AND WESTERN UNITY  (By Edward N. Stirewalt)  Within  the next  few days  this govern ment must make a major decision: whether  to permit  the Anglo-French Concorde  to  land on our airfields. In pondering that deci sion,  there are compelling reasons why we  should consider not only enviro:runental fac tors and the like but also certain basics, such  as equity and health of the Western alliance.  We must put the Concorde issue into its  historic perspective. After World War  II,  when Russia declined to demobilize and re fused to be dislodged from Central and East ern Europe, America correctly foresaw that a  powerful bulwark against further Communist  expansion was essential and that the only  barricade which would last would be a strong  Western Europe.  It was not a pastoral no-man's-land that  we wanted: beautiful farms would not stop  Soviet  tanks. The only  effective  bulwark  would be a dynamic industrial society. Such  a society required two things: a strong, pro gressive  technological base parallel  to our  own, and political stability and cohesion. And  the sine qua non for both was a vigorous,  healthy economy. This concept was the whole  basis for the Marshall Plan and the founda tion for the NATO structure.  The plan succeeded almost beyond our  fondest dreams. When trouble spots arose,  we have done our best to smooth them over,  to steer our friends around and past them.  One of  the  thorniest has been  the  long  dispute  between  the  British  and  the  French  over  Britain's  entry  into  the  Common Market. Surviving and SUl'mounting  even this long hassle and standing as a sort  of symbol of will-to-live-together despite it  all has been the joint British-French Con corde project. Indeed, the Concorde was a  living demonstration of the kind of thing  America cherished for all of Western Europe:  cohesion on long-term projects and mutual  benefit despite temporary differences.  It was not enough that Western Europe  should rebuild a traditional industrial base;  to be a real buffer against Soviet hegemony,  she must become second  to none  in high  technology-a  leader with America  in  the  unfolding wave of applied science of every  description. It was not enough that troops  be committed to the common defense;  there  must be political cohesion adequate to con tain and resolve  thorny questions of arms  production, military basing and command  and control. The economy must not be static  and involuted, but it must look to the fu ture through vigorous competition and ex ternal trade. Concorde is not just another  sophisticated  tank or missile, not another  advanced radar or superior fighter-bomber.  Concorde now emerges as the very icon of  America's dream  for Western Europe:  su",1976
54,,94,0.3,719,2,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, during the  closing hours of the first session, I ad dressed  the House on  the continuing  Soviet violations of their strategic arms  limitations agreement with the United  States.  My purpose was to draw attention not  only to the existing violations-because  those violations pertain directly to the  SALT I agreement-but also  to likeli hood of Soviet compliance with provi sions of any SALT II agreement which  the United States and the Soviet Union  might enter into this or next yea~  In my remarks on December 19 I ~ailed  for a suspension of the SALT II negotia tions until such time as the Soviet Union  shows substantially improved compliance  with SALT I, concluding:  The  time has come  for  a  fundamental  rethinking ot our overall military posture,  and our strategic nuclear posture in particu lar. To this end, it would be in our interest  to defer any further negotiations on strategic  nuclear arms until the Soviets have shown  substantially  improved  compliance  with  SALT I. This would permit time for a  re evaluation of our strategic posture, and also  time for a better definition of where our  strategic interests lte.  An  important  reinforcement of my  position-that there has been substantial  substantive noncompliance by  the So viets-was made  during  the  recess  through a perceptive analysis in the Wall  Street Journal, written by  their edi torial page editor, Robert Bartley. This  article details, item by item, the efforts  within the U.S. bureaucracy to smoke screen the question of Soviet compliance,  summarized in Mr. Bartley's finding that  ""having ordered the bureaucracy not to  find violations,  the Secretary of State  now  asks us  to  take comfort  in  the  fact that the bureaucracy has found no  violations.""  I  think  the article  is worthy of  the  careful attention of every Member, and  I include its full text at this point in our  proceedings:  THE BUREAUCRATIC SALTSCREEN  [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 13, 1976]  (By Robert L. Bartley)  Secretary of State Kissinger will be flying  off to Moscow, perhaps as soon as this com ing weekend, in an effort to firm up a second  strategic arms pact with the Soviet Union.  In doing so, he is brushing off both Soviet  activities in Angola and charges by former  U.S. defense officials  that  the Soviets are  cheating on the first arms pact.  Some of  these charges were detailed  in  an article in this space on December 19. Its  theme was that the Soviets have been ex hibiting shyster-like behavior on SALT-I,  wbich concerns easily monitored things like  huge missile silos, and that thns it would  1951  be foolish to rely on SALT-II to limit their  deployment  of  small  and  elusive  cruise  missiles.  To the charges of Soviet misbehavior, Sec retary Kissinger offers a fundamentally bu reaucratic  answer-government  officialdom  agrees  there are no ""violations,"" so forget  it. Even at this late date in Mr. Kissinger's  career such arguments apparently  impress  some people, at least to judge by a column  in The Washington Post by Stephen S.  Rosenfeld. So a  few words are needed on  Dr. Kissinger and the bureaucracy.  Specifically,  Secretary Kissinger  assures  us that in the Verification Panel, a high-level  inter-agency group on SALT, all decisions  have been unanimous. In fact, the Verifica tion Panel  is a discussion and bargaining  forum; whether  there  is  any meaningful  sense in which it makes decisions is a moot  question. Certainly it does not operate by  voting, as Mr. Kissinger's phraseology sug gests. What actually happens there might be  understood by studying the way SALT-I was  negotiated, as described by John Newhouse  in ""Cold Dawn,"" a book written on informa tion probably supplied with Mr. Kissinger's  authorization.  One issue stalling the SALT-I negotiations  was submarine-launched ballistic missiles;  the U.S. had a numerical lead but the So viets were building rapidly. In April 1972,  Mr. Kissinger-then President Nixon's se curity advisor-flew off  to Moscow,  so se cretly that even the head of the U.S. SALT  delegation did not know he was  there. In  those  meetings  Soviet  Party  Chairman  Brezhnev said submarines could be included  in  the agreement  if  the Soviets were al lowed 62 submarines with 950 missiles, com pared with the  then-existing U.S.  total o!  41 submarines and 656 missiles.  A Verification Panel meeting had bee:1  scheduled for April 28. One conceivable way  to proceed would have been to put the Soviet  offer on the table for discussion and deci sion, unanimous or otherwise. Instead, Mr.  Kissinger pondered the problem of how to  move what Mr. Newhouse describes as a ""deal  worked out"" from the ""back channel"" into  the ""front channel."" Mr. Kissinger ordered a  briefing paper on what submarine numbers  (italics from  the original). The mid-range number turned  out to be 62. As the meeting was convened,  Mr. Newhouse reports, ""some, though prob ably not all of  the principals knew  that  Brezhnev had put forward an SLBM proposal  with specific numbers.""  In the meeting Mr. Kissinger bargained  with Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Pentagon  wanted a speed-up of development of new  Trident submarines, and Mr. Kissinger asked  how many boats the Russians would have  without an agreement by 1978, when  the  first Tridents could be ready. The answer was  80, and Mr. Kissinger said  the agreement  should hold them to a  lower number. Mr.  Newhouse reports, ""The meaning of the ex change between Kissinger and Moorer was  clear to those who heard it. The Navy would  have Trident, assuming Congressional ap proval, and  the President would have  the  support of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff for an SLBM deal that gave the So viets nearly half again as many missile-car rying submarines as the United States."" ...  But the SALT deal had already been ""worked  out"" between Mr. Kissinger and Secretary  Brezhnev. Mr. Kissinger concealed this infor mation from  the Verification Panel as he  bargained with and manipulated its mem bers to win their acquiesence to the Soviet  proposals. Now comes Secretary Kissinger to  point to ""unanimous"" Verification Panel de cisions as a  reason  for confidence  in  the  judgments of government officialdom.  the Russians ""might propose""            That t;he  issue of Soviet compliance with  SAI.T-I has been treated in a similar fashion  ",1976
55,House,94,-0.324,732,2,Mr. HARRIS.," Mr. Speaker, I am op posed to the rule before us today and the  Krueger substitute to the Natural Gas  Emergency Act. House approval of the  Krueger deregulation proposal would be  one of the gravest mistakes of the 94th  Congress. It would be disastrous for the  average American family.  It is totally ill advised for the House  of Representatives to be considering a  bill of this magnitude via this subversion  of the orderly legislative process which  this rule represents. It is absurd for this  House to be voting on a bill when serious,  long-term questions about the natural  gas situation are in limbo. Questions like:  What is the true status of our reserves not the  industry's estimates?  Is  there  underproduction  from Federal  leases?  Are producers withholding natural gas  in anticipation of higher prices? There  is no way we can cast an informed vote  without  having definitive,  substantive  answers to these and many other ques tions. When the two Interstate and For eign Commerce subcommittees complete  their hearings and produce for us a com plete hearing record and report, we will  then be ready to consider legislation. We  should not be writing long term, com plicated legislation dealing with such a  basic issue on the floor of the House. I  cannot be a party to such a stampede.  The subject is too critical, the ramifica tions too dangerous.  What concerns me equally is the po tential impact of the Krueger deregula:.  tion proposal on the average American  consumer. Frankly,  it  is  inconceivable  to me that during a  time of 8 percent  inflation and over 8 percent unemploy ment we could be considering a proposal  that will add nearly 1 percent to  the  inflation rate this year. Even more seri ous are the ripple effects which could  expand this inflation jump to 1 ~ pei' cent. Deregulation would  increase  the  unemployment rate by 0.4 to 0. 7 percent age point. Since 45 percent of the cost  of fertilizer is natural gas costs, deregula tion will significantly boost food prices.  This proposal will cost consumers be tween $12.7 and $14.6 billion by the end  of 1976, for no extra supply. The cumula tive costs for the 10 years ending in 1985  will be a whopping $75 billion. In simple  terms,  this means  the average  family  will be paying $400 more a year in higher  prices due to deregulation.  The proponents of price deregulation  and other apologists of  the petroleum  industry are quick to speak of free mar ket forces and the evils of business reg ulation by Government. No one who  lived through the bureaucratic postwar  price control era as I did would lightly  consider price control on basic commod ities .. But you and I know that no free  market exists in the petroleum industry  today and the same big oil companies  who have fixed and maintained an arti ficiaUy high price for crude oil around  the  attempting to exact the  ,J,rorld }re  ",1976
56,House,94,-0.345,745,2,Mr. STAGGERS.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New York <Mr. OTTINGER), a member of  the committee.  ",1976
57,House,94,-0.391,745,2,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Chairman,  the  passage of  the rule providing for  the  consideration of  the Krueger amend ment was distressing procedurally;  the  consequences of that amendment's pas sage would be a substantive disaster. I  strongly urge its defeat.  This is not the time for discussing de regulation at all, not while the U.S. en ergy oligopoly and the OPEC cartel rule  the pricing of energy, and competition in  the natural gas production and pipeline  industries is illusory at best. Deregula tion should only be contemplated when  there truly is a free market with active  and open competition to protect the con sumer.  Certainly we need natural gas for the  future. But will  deregulation  assure  those needed  supplies or only assure  higher prices  for  the gas companies?  And can we afford it today? I do not be lieve we can, and I do not believe that  the American people will reap any tan gible benefits from it.  In fact,  the principal beneficiary of  gas deregulation would be the monop olized and anticompetitive energy  in dustry. The handful of firms which will  gain most from deregulation of ""new""  natural gas are those that produce off shore  gas-which  coincidentally  also  happen to be the major oil firms, for the  most part. The American people have  not heard from any of these companies  a pledge  that exploration, drilling, or  production will be stepped up as a result  of deregulation. There would be nothing  to prevent these companies from invest ing their congressionally donated wind falls on circuses, department stores or  other ventures.  In fact, the notion that a ""just and  reasonable"" rate can be determined in  the  energy marketplace  by  ""natural  economic forces"" runs counter to every thing we know about  the oil and gas  companies, and has been rejected out-of hand by  the courts many  times, most  recently in the 1974 Texaco case  (417  U.S. 380). In that decision, the Supreme  Court said:  Th& natural gas industry was heavily con centrated and ... monopolistic forc&S wer&  distorting the market price for natural gas.  Hence, the necessity for regulation.    ;    Supply and demand are not deter mined in the energy marketplace by free  market forces. Rather, prices are arti ficially inflated by limiting production by more than 50 percent in the Gulf of  Mexico-shutting in wells-also accounting for more than 50 percent of the leases  in the gulf-and concealing supplies and  reserves, as was demonstrated before the  subcommittee on Oversight and Investi gations last month. The beleaguered consumer must adjust his demand accord ingly; he cannot depend upon ""market  forces"" to insure that he will be able to  afford the fuel he needs to heat his home.  There is no question that our supplies  and reserves of natural gas, as with every  other fuel, are limited. But finite sup plies and concealed reserves are two dif ferent things. As our colleague, DoN FRA SER, suggested to the Energy and Power  Subcommittee, resource constraints will  remain with us no matter how high we  allow the price of natural gas to rise. In  fact, there is a substantial evidence that  the current claimed shortages are due  to a deliberate withholding of supplies,  an underre;porting of  reserves, and a  slowdown in exploration, all in anticipa tion of the deregulation held out as a  carrot to  the  industry by  the Nixon Ford administrations. These hopes have  been fueled by the so-called regulators  at the Federal Power Commission who  have been outspoken critics of the very  laws  they are charged with executing  and enforcing. Simply eliminating con trols and deregulating the price certainly  Will not result in any long-term lessening  of our resource constraints, nor will it  restore needed competition  to  the gas  industry.  Let us  examine,  then, whether  in creased prices will actually mean signifi cantly  increased supplies. I  think not.  Also, such small additional supplies as  are predicted to be made available in the  short term by deregulation will come at  an horrendous cost. The General Ac counting Office suggests that our most  realistic chances for additional natural  gas will mean only about 400 billion cubic  feet more  than  the 19.4  trillion cubic  feet  that we  could  expect  after  3  years  of  continued  regulation. That  amounts  to a minuscule 2-percent in crease. And for this, American consum ers will be asked to pay anyWhere from  the GAO's estimate of an additional $9  billion to a Library of Congress estimate  of $15 billion in the first year of deregu lation-an incremental addition at the  incredible price of $3 per thousand cubic  feet or more.  For millions of Americans,  this will  not be an easy adjustment to swallow.  As an article in the Wall Street Journal  pointed out last week, steep price in creases for fuel have been more than an  expensive inconvenience for many poor  and elderly Americans. Energy price in creases have brought economic hardship,  serious deprivation, and real discomfort  to hundreds of thousands. The claims of  deregulation advocates do not stack up  against the experience of people already  suffering severely as a result of rising fuel  costs. And of course, as increased fuel  costs accumulate  through every sector  of the economy, both inflation and unem ployment will increase.  Increased prices will mean more ef ficient use of a precious fuel, say deregulation advocates, and will mean better  conservation efforts. ""With frugal con servation measures,"" says  the Journal  article, a church in a poor parish near  Yankee Stadium in the Bronx has so far  managed to pay its rising heat bill while  the priest has engaged  in a  relentless  do-it-yourself effort to patch broken win dows and replace window sashes to keep  out the cold. ""Still,  the priest worries  whether the next round of rate increases  will  finally  outstrip his  parishioners'  ability to pay.""  This is but one example of how falla cious, and even cruel, the industry's argu ments are. The fact is that at the present  time, gas producers are guaranteed at  least a 15to 18-percent return on in vested capital by FPC rate-setting prin ciples. This should be ample-a far higher  rate than permitted to most utilities and would be ample to achieve full gas  production were it not for the adminis tration-fed hope held out for a doubling  or tripling of prices via deregulation. The  short-term solution to the problem lies,  in my view,  in establishing parity be tween interstate and intrastate markets;  in the long term, we must restore real  competition  to the energy marketplace  to lay the foundation for deregulation  under which consumers will be protected.  I urge my colleagues to join with me  in voting against the Krueger amend ment, as well as against any other de regulation proposal brought before us  today.  ",1976
58,House,94,-0.547,745,2,Mr. ECKHARDT.," Mr. Chairman,  in  August of this year the Federal Energy  Administration  issued a  report called  ""The Natural Gas Shortage: A Pre liminary Report."" The report said that  the natural gas shortage had been grow ing rapidly, that last year's curtailments  were up to 2 trillion cubic feet, or 10 per cent of the total demand, and that for  1974 curtailments were  likely to be 45  percent greater, up to 2.9  tr1llion cubic  feet, or about 15 percent of demand.  ""Even with natural gas deregulation,""  said the report, ""shortages can be ex pected to grow in each succeeding winter  for several years and could approach  1.9 trillion cubic feet in the 1976-77 heat ing season.""  FEA hinted at a  temporary solution  to near-term  shortages  in  its  report,  finding that ""because of the economic  slowdown and much higher prices, no  shortage and possibly a  surplus exists  in  the  intrastate markets,  primarily  Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma.""

61,House,94,-0.27,758,2,Mr. PREYER.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the Krueger amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I come from a con suming, rather than a producing, State  as far as natural gas is concerned. Most  of us, in our consuming State, were very  happy in years past with the regulation  of natural gas at artificially low prices.  We benefited; only the big oil companies  suffered, or so we thought. After all, de regulation would only make the rich oil  men richer. We would stand with  the  people and the consumers, and against  the vested interests.  We  laughed at  the Texas  bumper  sticker: ""Let the Yankee bastards freeze  in the dark."" We are not laughing any  longer. North Carolina is not a Yankee  State, and we are not on the verge of  freezing in the dark-about 70 percent  of natural gas in North Carolina goes to  industry, not homes; but we are on the  verge of  large-scale unemployment  in  our  industries because of  the natural  gas shortage-if not this year, then next  year, and the year after that. We are  gradually exhausting all the patchwork  and ""emergency"" solutions  to our di lemma.  More  ominously, we  face,  further  down the road, a movement of our key  industries from North Carolina to one  of the new ""Arab"" States of the United  States-the  gas-producing  States  of  Texas, Louisiana, or Oklahoma.  Three  industries of North Carolina  that are of critical concern to our State  require the use of natural gas: The tex tile  industry  requires  it for  finishing  processes;  the brick industry must use  its clean, steady flame in brick process ing;  fertilizer plants absolutely require  it for nitrogen fertilizer production. In  some of these processes, propane can be  substituted,  but propane  is  in  even  shorter supply than natural gas.  In North Carolina, the principal in dustrial users of natural gas axe the texim tile industry, brick manufn.cturing, and  fertilizer plants. Both the textile indus try and the brick manufacturing indus try are of critical  importance  to  the  economy of North Carolina. The textile  industry is the largest single employer  within the State with shipments valued  at about $8 billion annually. It employs  approximately 360,000 employees, with  an annual payroll of $1,665,000,000.  The brick  industry, which produces  nearly 15 percent of the total bricks pro duced in the United States, will suffer  significantly without adequate supplies  of a clean-burning fuel. Like textiles, it  is a labor intensive indl)stry. The brick  industry in North Carolina employs 3,100  persons, and there are presently some  14,500  bricklayers and helpers within  the State who also depend on the manu facture of brick. In addition there are  approximately  127,400  employees  in volved in construction work within the  State who are also affected. Thus, it is  easy to determine that natural gas cur tailments in the brick manufacturing in dustry could result in widespread plant  closings, with substantial adverse  pacts not only upon their employees and  the local economies, but upon the con struction  industry  generally,  both  in  North Carolina and throughout the en tire east coast and the Nation.  The State's largest user of natural gas  is Farmers Chemical Association nitro gen fertilizer plant at Tunis, N.C. As  Members of this body know, natural gas  is absolutely essential to nitrogen fertil izer production. This plant operates on a  24-hour basis, 7 days a week, and it has  been estimated that 19 million bushels  of corn will not be produced because this  plant was closed for 3 weeks at the be ginning of 1975 because natural gas was  not available. This plant supplies most  of the nitrogen fertilizer for the eastern  seaboard.  As a consuming State, we have looked  for every possible ""out,"" short of deregu lation.  Our State has  instituted a  rigorous  conservation policy,  for one  thing. No  natural gas is used as a boiler fuel any where in North Carolina so that we could  conserve natural gas for its unique uses  for which there is no substitute. Busi nesses have instituted conservation plans  which have posted impressive economies  in the use of natural gas. Residential use  has been decreased by 15 percent. But  these conservation efforts have not been  nearly enough.  We have looked for villains as a solu tion. Perhaps gas producers have capped  wells or held back production in expec tation of higher prices? North Carolina  has instigated investigations and court  suits  to  test this  theory. The answer?  Probably some is being held back, human  nature being as uneven in quality as it is,  but clearly not enough to make any sig nificant difference, not enough to solve  our problems.  What about some of the new miracle  technological alternatives we have been  hearing about, such as coal gasification,  or developing acetylene  from coal, or  cracking the Devonian shale to reach its  gas deposits? I had the opportunity to  sit on the Energy and Environment Subcommittee of  the Government Opera tions Committee which explored  these  alternatives. The answer is that the unit  costs Df these-alternatives is so high that  it will be many years, if ever, before they  are economically feasible.  Most of us in consuming North Caro lina have been driven reluctantly but  inevitably  to  the conclusion that some  kind of phased-out deregulation of nat ural gas prices is not only the best long range but is also the best short-range  solution to the natural gas shortage.  The status quo is intolerable. In North  Carolina  it  is expected  that less  than  40 percent of industrial demand for gas  will be met this winter. It could be as  low as 4 percent. We have reached the  limits of  savings  that can be accom plished by conservation. Hand-to-mouth  solutions such as purchases on the intra state market or ""emergency"" supplies to  particular plants cannot go on year after  year.  The Government Operations Commit tee  report stated that curtailments of  natural gas deliveries this winter indi  cate a ""bUdding national economic dis aster,"" and that it might well bring cata strophic consequences to many regions,  such as North Carolina. We cannot mud dle through year after year. The situa tion  is getting progressively worse. We  must do something. The best thing to do  is  to deregulate in the manner of  the  Krueger amendment.  In North Carolina we have been forced  to look at the basic causes of the shortage  and can only conclude  that it is  the  artificially low price for interstate gas.  It has created a distortedly high de mand for the most limited and precious  of our fossil  fuels. When powerplants  are paying only one-fourth to one-third  as much for gas as for fuel oil is it any  wonder that we find it so hard to keep  them from wasting this valuable fuel in  boilers?  Further, the low controlled interstate  price of natural gas  creates an un natural diversion of gas from the inter state  to  the  intrastate market where  purchasers can pay unregulated competi tive market prices.  There is a surplus of gas in unregulated  intrastate markets, a shortage in regu lated interstate markets. This is an eco nomic fact of life: gas goes where the  money is, not where the need is, much  as we might wish it was not so. And what  concerns us  in North Carolina is  that  industries which must have gas, regard less of price-like the textile, brick, and  fertilizer industries-will also go where  the gas  is, namely  to one of  the gas producing States.  Finally, the artificially low price has  inhibited the drilling for new gas. The  statistics are stark. In the past 20 years  we have increased our consumption of  natural gas  threefold. Since  the  late  1950's we have been finding substantially  less gas each year than we have been  consuming. We are drilling only about  half the number of wells we were drilling  20 years ago, and we are finding only  one-sixth of  the new gas  reserves we  were finding.  This means deregulation of wellhead  prices to encourage more and higher risk  ",1976
62,House,94,-0.469,771,2,Mr. FRASER.," Mr. Chairman, there is  widespread  concern among consumers  over increased costs resulting from de regula.tion of new natural gas wellhead  prices. The proponents of deregulation  claim that if price ceilings were elimi nated,  the problem of excess demand  would disappear. People would use less  gas because it would cost more. But these  advocates of deregulation  insist  illogi cally that the additional cost would be  so slight as to be imperceptible.  The General Accounting Office,  in a  January 14, 1976, report, concluded that  deregulation could mean an increase in  energy costs to U.S. consumers of $75  billion by 1985. The peak impact, accord ing to this report would come in 1980,  when the extla cost to gas users would  be $13 billion.  I believe these figures err on the low  side. GAO has assumed that the price  of gas will be set by  the price of an  equivalent amount of heat produced from  a barrel of imported crude oil, at a price  of $12 a barrel. But gas consumers can not burn crude oil. They must turn to  propane or fuel oil, which sells for $15.50  a barrel, or roughly 30 percent more than  crude oil.  The peak impact according to GAO,  moreover, would come at the worst pos sible  time,  just as we might otherwise  be achieving full economic recovery.  I insert in the RECORD at this point a  resolution passed by the 18th Constitu tional Convention of the Minnesota AFL CIO indicating concern over rising con sumer costs under deregulation:  RESOLUTION 172, SEPTEMBER 9, 1975  Whereas,  the Federal Power Commission  recommended removing Federal price con trols on natural gas production and  Whereas,  removing controls would result  in much higher natural gas prices for home owners and  Whereas, the changeover to other forms of  heating and cooling would result in a very  expensive modification  for  the homeowner  so as to make this almost prohibitive, and  Whereas, the homeowner is a captive con sumer of natural gas; now  therefore be it  resolved:  That  the 18tl;l. Constitutional Convention  of the Minnesota AFL-CIO go on record to  oppose deregulation of natural gas prices at  the wellhead.  Mr. Chairman, if workable competi tion existed within the natural gas in dustry, then deregulation and the free  market might offer a  solution  to our  natural gas supply problems.  But this is not the case. Eighty-five  percent of natural gas production is in  the hands of about 25 major companies.  Furthermore, sales of uncommitted gas  are overwhelmingly controlled by  the  eight major producers. In 1974, sales by  the top eight natural gas producers made  up from 60 to 99 percent of new contract  sales to interstate pipelines.  Perhaps even more significant is  the  lack of competition among buyers of nat ural gas. If the pipeline companies were  as interested in getting lower prices as  producers are  in getting higher ones,  then perhaps a free marketplace could  protect C>Qnsumers  from  prices which  are higher than are needed, just, or rea sonable. But the pipeline companies have  no interest in bargaining with producers  since they pass through the entire cost  of the gas they purchase to their cus tomers, who for the most part are captive  consumers.  I would like to include in the RECORD at  this point a  resolution adopted by the  Minnesota Public Service Commission  opposing  the Krueger amendment and  deregulation of natural gas prices. The  resolution, which follows, points out that  ""the natural gas industry does not oper ate in a free market"" and warns against  the ""grave consequences"" of ""a possible  seven hundred percent increase  in the  wellhead price of natural gas"" if we ac cept the Krueger amendment.  The resolution follows:  A RESOLUTION BY THE MINNESOTA PUBLIC  SERVICE COMMISSION  Whereas, H.R. 9464 is currently being con sidered by the House of Representatives of  the Congress of the United States; and  Whereas,  an  amendment  to  this  bill,  known as  the Krueger Amendment, would  deegulate the price of natural gas; and  Whereas, the natural gas industry does not  operate in a free market wherein the law of  supply and demand provides a measure of  consumer protection; and  Whereas, the prices set by OPEC are at the  highest point the  traffic will bear making  regulation essential  for  the protection of  com,umers  the  stability  of  the  national  economy; and  Whereas,  the Minnesota Public  Service  Commission is vi tally concerned and anxious  to do everything in its power to guard against  the grave consequences which would result  from a possible seven hundred percent in crease in the wellhead price of natural gas  as would gradually occur under  the pro visions of pending  legislation; now,  there fore  Be  it resolved by  the Minnesota Public  Service Commission in regular meeting as sembled this 19th day of January, 1976, that  this Commission go on record as urging the  members of our congressional delegation to  vote against adoption of the Krueger Amend ment to H.R. 9464.

63,House,94,-0.464,784,2,Mr. KOCH.," Mr. Speaker, my colleague,  Representative JA:M:Es H. ScHEUER, and I  are introducing a bill which we believe  proVides the most sensible reform of the  food stamp program to date. This pro posal was introduced in the other body  by Senator JACOB JAVITS as S. 2840 and  is entitled ''The National Food Stamp  Reform Act of 1975.""  We commend Senator JAVI'l:s and his  .staff for developing this b111 and for the  extensive research and expertise which  they have brought to bear on this impor tant public  issue. We wholeheartedly  endorseS. 2840, and we are making only  one minor addition to it--to provide a  deduction for a household's medical ex penses in excess of $100 per year.  _ We want to emphasize that we think  the food stamp progrrun is a good, valu able and necessary program which hall  been much maligned for some adminis trative shortcomings. We realize  it  is  expensive, but we support the principle  of feeding the hungry and underfed in  America, and we  think it is worth the  money. This is not to say that we do not  believe there has been waste or abuse,  but we believe this has primarily been the  result of the complexity of the law and  administrative mishandling. we  have  some suggestions to remedy this.  First, our bill provides a *'standard'.'  deduction of $135 per month for a family  of four to replace Inost of the present  cwnbersome and complex maze of item ized deductions. Under the present sys tem, each applicant family must present  caseworkers with receipts showing ex penses for such items as rent .. electricity,  gas, oil, water, real estate taxes,. and even  babysitting fees.  Under our proposal,  there would be  one standard deduction ro replaee most  of these items, although we would allow  additional deductions of $30 per month  for a family with a working person-to  allow for expenses sueh as babysitting  and bus fare-and $25 per month for a  family with an elderly person. The legis lation  retains  itemized deductions for  withheld State, local and Federal income  taxes, and for extraordinary casualty or  medical  expenses, because we  cannot  standardize their impact on an families.  Second, our bill will eliminate the re quirement that a family pay some of its  own money  in order  food  stamps. Under the present law, a. family  of four may pay as much as $140 to ob tain $166 worth of stamps. Their actual  benefit is only $26, yet the Federal and  State governments must. pay  for  the  printing and distributing o:f $166 worth  of stamps. A  recent stud$' of the New  Yorlt State food stainp pt ogram  showed  that 27.4 percent of the eligible house holds on the program could not a.tford to  purchase their full allotment. of stamps.  The Senate Agriculture Committee has  estimated that eliminating the purchase  requirement would save $30. million in  administrative costs. Since  this would  also cut the number of food stamps in  circulation by one-half, it would sub stantially  reduce  the so-called ""black  market"" for stamps. This reform would  also end abuse of the program by private  vendors who as Government agents now  sell food stamJ;;s but sometimes pocket  the money they receive.  Additionally, our program encourages  members of the household to work. First,  a working household can obtain the extra  per month  deduction mentioned  above. Second, as a household's income  increases,  food stamp benefits will be  reduced by 25 percent of the additional  income; not by 30 percent. as in other  reform proposals. The median income :for  a family of four in owr country is: about  $14,<YOO. Under our proP<Jsal a family  four . with one member  &rking and in come after local and Federal taxes and  extraordinary expenses of no more than  $8,796 qualifies  for $24 per month  in  to obtain  $30  f  ",1976
64,Senate,94,-0.743,823,2,Mr. ABOUREZK.," Mr. President, when  the concept of getting the mail service  out of politics was considered 5 years ago,  it had the support of both liberals and  conservatives. Now people of all political  stripes are coming around to realize that  our hopes have not been realized and  grow dimmer every day.  James J. Kilpatrick correctly points  out that the assumptions on which we  based  prospects  for  an  independent  postal corporation have not proved valid.  The result has been a staggering debt and  little prospect of paying them through  operating revenues without drastic cuts  in service or increases in postage.  I agree with Mr. Kilpatrick that the  least unacceptable and most  realistic  answer is to have the Federal Govern ment regain financial and policy over sight  responsibility.  I  ask unanimous  consent that the article of James J. Kil patrick from the January 29 Washington  Star be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  POSTAL SERVICE-AN EXPERIMENT GoNE SOUR  (By James J. Kilpatrick)  More than four years have gone by since  the old U.S. Post Office Department became  the new U.S. Postal Service. The idea at the  time-and it seemed such a good idea at the  time-was to get the mail out of politics. A  dismal  conclusion has  to be voiced: We  had better get the mail back into politics  again.  That conclusion comes hard. The concept  of a kind of private postal service was first  advanced seriously by an old-line  liberal,  Lawrence O'Brien, but  conservatives  em braced it with whoops and hollers. Down with  politicians I Up with businessmen  instead!  Private enterprise would do the job.  It was a noble experiment;  it was worth  trying; but it hasn't worked, and the best  thing to do with experiments that go sour is  to drop them.  One of  the  troubles  is  that  the Postal  Service created by Congress in 1971 has been  only ""a kind of"" private corporation. It has  been only  a  quasi-private operation-the  sort of hybrid that George Wallace refers to  contemptuously as a  ""psooo-do."" The cor poration inherited so many political liabili ties that it could not create offsetting assets.  Three premises supported the new Postal  Service:  ( 1) Postal volume would keep ris ing, (2) machanization would answer prob lems, and  t3) business management would  be successful.  None of  the premises has proved valid.  Except for second class (publications), mail  is declining in volume, Mechanization has in creased, from 25 percent of volume in 1971  to 60 percent in 1975, but the expected eco nomics have not materialized. Without get ting into personalities, it has to be said that  business management has not been remark ably brilliant. The new managers of  the  Postal Service got suckered into labor con tracts of a  lushness almost beyond belief.  The Postal Service has 595,000 e1nployees;  ",1976
65,Senate,94,-0.598,849,2,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, one  of the most persistent difficulties which  I encounter in my support of the Geno cide Convention is assuring people that  ratification will not weaken the United  States in the fact of an increasingly hos tile  internatJ.onal environment. Today  I want to address myself specifically to  the argument that our ratification of  the Convention will open American citi zens  abroad  to  arrest  and  trial  on  charges of genocide. This notion could  not be farther from the truth. Endorse ment of the Convention would have vir tually no effect on  the  treatment of  American citizens in foreign nations.  Right now, without United States rati fication of  the Genocide Convention,  American citizens in the physical terri tory and/or control of a foreign nation  can be charged and tried for any offense,  from robbery to espionage to genocide.  Every nation has absolute  jurisdiction  within its own boundaries in the imple mentation  of  its  legal  statutes. The  United States has no legal recourse on  behalf of its citizens abroad. The Geno cide Convention does nothing to change  this procedure.  Americans will not be any more or  less subject to the legal whims of for eign nations after our ratification of the  Convention. The intent of the Conven tion is to codify universally the illegality  of genocide. By presenting a united ap proach to genocide, nations demonstrate  more clearly to potential genocidists their  commitment to the prevention and pun ishment of the clime. Article IV of the  Convention  protects  nationals  living  abroad by stipulating that individuals di rectly responsible for genocide shall be  tried and punished. Ratification of the  Genocide Convention will not jeopardize  Americans overseas. Lack of ra tiftca tion  may very well jeopardize helpless millions  who fall under the yoke of mass mur derers.

69,Senate,94,0.272,901,2,Mr. ROTH.," Mr. President, during my  travels throughout the State of Delaware,  I find that people are confident and ex pectant about the future of our country,  but are frustrated and concerned about  the present course of Government. For  many,  the promise of Government has  been broken-either unfulfilled or not to  be trusted. I believe we in Congress have  a continuing responsibility to reexamine  the quality of Government services and  strive to deliver dependability and value  rather than inflation and empty rhetoric.  I am introducing legislation today with  Senator EDMUND MUSKIE Which Will pro Vide a means to improve the budget proc ess and assure that the American tax payer will get improved services equal to  the high price each pays.  This bill provides for a complete re view  in Congress of each Government  spending program every fourth year. It  requires that each dollar of spending be  examined so that money is not wasted  on programs which are ineffective or are  of low priority. This legislation is  im portant for Congress because it will pro vide Congress the means to reform spend ing, but it is even more important for  the American people because it answers  to their demand for fiscal responsibility  in Government.  Public confidence will remain low as  long as our Government makes no visible  progress in trimming duplication, inef ficiency, waste, and redtape from its mul tibillion dollar budget. Nothing is more  upsetting to the people than to see infla tion and joblessness grow at the hands  of Government spenders who fail to cure  even the most obvious defects.    The growth of Federal spending ha.S  been so rapid during the past decade tnat  the impact of the Federal budget on the  economy has measurably  increased. In  1967, the Federal budget was $158.2 bil. lion. Only 10 years later, we have a pro posed  budget  totaling  $394.2  billion,  nearly 2%  times  larger. In  the last 3  years alone, spending has increased by  as much as it did in the 176 years from  1789 to 1965.  Congress has made great improvement  in its handling of the national budget in  1ecent years. In 1974 the historic Budget  and  Impoundment Control Act was  passed to allow Congress a procedure to  set a spending ceiling and to require all  committees to remain within that ceiling  during the appropriations process.  I worked hard  in support of  these  budget reforms and I am equally com mitted to the goal of new spending re forms.  The budget reform has been instru mental  in keeping  the annual budget  within specific limits. However, it creates  no process to serve as a check on growth  in the size of the budget. Nor does it pro vide a means for Congress to evaluate its  spending patterns and eliminate dupli cation or ineffective programs.  Congress must face the spending issue  head on. It is all too easy to agree on a  rubbery spending ceiling which can later  be amended  to allow higher spending  levels.  It is commonsense  that where  two  programs serve one objective, combining  them would reduce administrative costs  and redtape. Yet throughout the Federal  service, many programs and agencies  .  Oft~~  Today there are nearly 1000 categori cal programs administered by 54 Federal  agencies. Ten agencies administer some  230 different health programs, including  23 for planning and building health fa cilities and 22  to deal with drug and  narcotics addiction.  There are seven Federal programs that  provide health services  for outpatient  health centers in one city-the District  of Columbia. Or, consider that there are  14 separate units within the Department  of Health Education, and Welfare which  administ~r programs for educating the  handicapped. Similarly, in the area of  Federal water pollution research and de velopment there are at least 25 bureaus  and offices in 12 separate departments  or independent agencies which serve the  same objective.  This duplication of effort only suc ceeds in impeding productivity and re ducing the effectiveness of Gover~me~t  services. Yet, year after year, funding lS  renewed  for most Federal  programs  without concern for wasteful overlap or  poor program effectiveness. This practice  becomes a  fruitless exercise  indeed of  throwing money at a problem without  regard for value or cost effectiveness.  There is always room to make gov ernment more efficient and more effec tive. This proposal which I am submit ting with Senator MusKI~ today wi.ll  provide that no spending  lS automati cally renewed until  it is shown  to be  worthwhile.  .  Throughout my career I have demon strated a strong commitment to better  government not bigger government. In  1969  I completed a 1,000-page report  which identified for the first  time the  full range of Government spendf.ng pro grams for domestic assistance. One of my  as a member of a Hoover Commission  earliest experiences in Government was  investigation whose recommendations to  streamline Government were subs tan tially adopted.  Each level of government must prac tice fiscal responsibility as well as preach  it. State and  local governments must  be equipped to deliver services financed  from their respective tax bases. Likewise  the Federal Government cannot con tinually add new spending without facing  up to the fiscal reality of a strained tax  base.  The legislation which we are offering  today, Mr. President, would make sev eral simple but basic changes in the way  Congress approaches the annual budget.  It would end  the unspoken  rule  that  money spent on a program this year must  be continued or increased in next year's  budget. The permanent authority  for  program budgeting had led the Federal  Government  into  the  fool's  trap  of  throwing good money after bad for a  wasted enterprise. This legislation offers  a procedure for quadrennial renewal of  all budget authority. The new assump tion will be that no new budget authority  is necessary until a program is proven  worthwhile and cost effective. This is a  familiar and sound practice of zero-base  program review and evaluation. It offers  a comprehensive yet critical review of  all Federal spending before new money  is committed to old programs.  This stricter process for review will  bring many other important reforms to  Government spending. It will help Con gress get a handle on uncontrollable  growth in spending. Since budget author ity must be renewed, higher costs will be  repeatedly  reassessed against program  goals. If a program expense outweighs  its benefits  to the economy or  to  the  health or social well-being of the peo ple then the program could be  termi nated. At a minimum an opportunity for  decisionmaking by the Congress will be  built into the budget procedure.  The periodic renewal of all program  authority in accordance with a zero-base  review will promote control over back door spending. Cost estimates for pro grams during succeeding budgets would  be required by standing committees in  order to evaluate each program before  advising Congress to reauthorize it.  The authorization process will be re structured to provide for a regular and  meaningful review of all existing pro grams. Programs will be assigned a re newal date with other programs in the  same broad area. The establishment of  a fixed renewal date would end the prac tice of providing permanent program  budget authority. It would establish reg ular  intervals  for program  review by  congressional committees and a  fixed  year for program renewal.    The first of four quadrennial renewal  periods would commence on October 1,  1981. All  programs,  unless  otherwise  exempted, would be reviewed once every  4 years. Thus, a program which is re viewed and renewed beginning October  1, 1981, would automatically come before  the appropriate committee for review in  1985 and renewal on or before October  1, 198~  In addition to a I'estructuring of the  authorization  process  this  legislation  provides for regular program evaluation  during each quadrennial review.  The President would submit legislation  to Congress for a proposed reauthoriza tion  and Congress would have until  March 15 of the following year to t eport  renewal legislation from the committee  of jurisdiction. During that period eval uation  and  review  of  each program  would occur.  .  The President would also submit a  .  ",1976

71,,94,-0.055,940,2,Mr. PEYSER.," Mr. Speaker, although  the New York City  fiscal  crisis has  abated somewhat, in the wake of the ad ministration's approval of aid  the  city, and although the issue of default  is no  longer blaring across  the front  page headlines of our Nation's news papers, default is still a very real prob lem  confronting  the Nation.  Indeed,  there is a very real horror tha;t not only  cities, but States as well may default.  The State of New York is currently un dergoing such a crisis.  During the course of the past several  months, I have augmented my own as sessment of  the current economic cli mate w~th talks with financial experts,  including New York State Comptroller  Arthur Levitt. Consequently, I am deep ly concerned that New York State may  not be able to market the approximately  $4 billion in bonds to the private sector  necessary between now and  this sum mer. This, coupled with the Governor's  new  budget,  could  have  devastating  impact.  First, it would mean a  loss of desper ately needed revenue for our local com munities,  already  tremendously  over burdened by local and property  taxes.  Second,  the State's  financial  picture  could prevent it from taking advantage  to which it  of potential Federal funds  has a right, by limiting the State's abil ity to meet the matching requirements.  Third, it could again lead to an emer gency situation requiring congressional  action  to prevent  the default of  the  State.  In order to avoid the dramatic si-tua tion  that we  experienced with New  to  York City, I have called upon the New  York State congressional delegation  work  together closely with Govel'nor  Carey  to assess  the  true budget prob lems of the State. However, I believe that  it  is crttical, not only  for New York  State, but for all other States and locali ties,  that  the Congress  immediately  make known  its  intention on revenue  sharing and other aid programs. It is  vital  that  local  governments  know  whether  this assistance will be forth coming.  Although the sitmvtion is serious, I be lieve that if the Congress acts responsi bly we can avoid another New York  City ""cliffhanger"" and still assure the  financial stability of New York State and  other municipal governments.  FIREMEN'S HASTE SAVES DOG BITE  VICTIM  HON. SAM STEIGER  OF ARIZONA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, Februa1y 3, 1976  ",1976
72,,94,0.447,940,2,Mr. STEIGER of Arizona.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  the Phoenix Fire Department  is recognized nationally not only for its  skill in combatting fires, but also for its  outstanding program of fire prevention  and for its life-saving paramedic units.  The high degree of efficiency of Phoe nix paramedics was demonstrated once  again on Janua1y 25 when Firemen Don  Koepp and E1nie McBroom saved the life  of a young girl who had been viciously  attacked by a dog. Mr. Koepp and Mr.  McBroom proved that they do their work  very well and with great human com passion.  I would like to recognize their efforts  by having reprinted in the RECORD an  article written by Max Jennings of the  Arizona Republic:  FmEMEN'S HASTE SAVES DOG BITE VICTIM  (By Max Jennings)  Firemen. Don Koepp and Ernie McBroom  were returning from a minor traffic accident  call and were about to pull into the fire sta tion when the radio crackled again for the  paramedics.  This time the call was for a dog bite vic  tim 15 blocks away. McBroom headed the  truck for the address at 1112 W. Hatcher.  The  two  firemen,  for whom emergencies  are routine, could not know a life was hang ing on the 90 seconds it would take them to  get there.  As the paramedics raced toward the home,  James Cowan struggled to loosen.  the vise like grip of a 100-pound Alaskan malamute  dog which had attacked his 10-year-old step daughter.  Cowman had been standing next to his dog  when it suddenly sprang at the girl, grabbing  her by the throat. He kicked it and tried to  drag it away, and then in desperation began  to choke it.  Finally  the  animal  freed  little  Patty  Grenados. As Cowan struggled to tie it up,  his wife, who had called firemen., daJbbed at  the gaping wound in her daughter's throat  with a washcloth.  When Koepp and McBroom arrived, Koepp  headed into the home. McBroom stayed to  get a first aid kit.  ",1976

74,,94,-0.509,966,2,Mr. BINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, one of  the outstanding leaders of Africa is Dr.  Kenneth Kaunda, PIesident of Zambia.  While bitterly opposed  to  the inter vention of South Mrica in Angola, he  has also registered strong opposition to  the intervention of the Soviet Union in  that war-torn land.  I have recently obtained the complete  text of President Kaunda's address at  the OAU summit meeting on January 12.  I commend this eloquent and important  speech  to my  colleagues  readers of the RECORD:  other  and  Feb1'twry 3, 19'16  SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY DR. KENNETH D.  KAUNDA,  PRESIDENT OF THE REP'UBLIC .OF  ZAMBIA TO THE FIRST EXTRAORDIN.'!.RY SES SION OF THE ASSEMBLY OP HEADS OF STATE  AND GOVERNMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION  OF AFRICAN UNITY AT ADDIS ABABA,  JANU ARY 12, 1976  Mr. Chairman, since the birth of the OAU,  this is the most serious and tragic crisis the  Continent has ever faced. Angola is serious  and tragic to the people of that country; it is  tragic in its implications for the u~ity and  security of Africa. Angola is an emotional is sue. It could divide Africa without ending the  war. It is an emotional iSsue because people,  as I am speaking now are dying. Men, women  and children, the sick and the poor are being  mowed down like animals by weapons from  couu tl'ies whose own nationals are enjoying  peace and progress in their own countries.  Angolans  suffered  from  colonialism  for  centuries and fought a war of liberation in  the last 14 years from Portuguese colonial  and fascist rule and for fun national inde pendence. Today, they live in the shadow of  death day in, day out. Today in vast areas of  independent and sove1eign Angola, dying ~  more sure than living. Men and women, old  and young live only one step ahead of the  disaster that dogs  them at every turning.  Africa has failed them. Angolans are dying  now while we are discussing ideology. ~he  people of Angola are suffering. refugees with out homes. I live nero Angola and I ,can hear  the voices of poor children crying in pai;l) and  desproation. Yet here we are debating. ide- ology in the comforts of dis~ce. Events in  Angola are saddening. Events in Angola are  a challenge to Africa .. The civil war in Angola  must be brought to an immediate end. We in  this Organiss,tion cannot on any grounds  wh.atsoever let or encourage Ango~ans to !,rill  one another or be killed. If the OAU has an  obligation to an independent Angola., it is to  stop the war. It is war, no matter how much  we try to interpret it. It is being fought with  tanks, armoured cars and even from the air.  Worse still, it is already  inte1nationalised.  We must reject the erroneous and dangerous  assumption that a truly Independent Angola  will only be achieved through intensification  of the civil war.  Therefore. this Summit must. very care fully and cooly, examine every aspect of the  Angolan  tragedy. We must  look  at  the  fundamental causes and not merely at the  effects of the civil war. We should not In dulge  in endless recriminations. We must  not sink so low as to trade insults amongst  ourselves.  I  am saddened and very deeply  hwt that ev:en yOlmg comrades in this Hall  whose Heads of State could not even leave  their countries. who could not even send  their Foreign Ministers could hurl insults at  us,  young Comrades who know  nothing  about the real struggle in Southern Africa  from  the safe distance of  their countries.  Zambians have died for the cause of libera tion. We  take  the problem of Southern  Africa  very  seriously  and  cannot  accept  insults.  This Swnmit should clearly address itself  to  the basic problem  in Angola and . then  suggest ways and means which will achieve  two  fundamental  aims namely~ first  the  ending of the conflict in Angola in the inter ests of Angolans as a whole and second the  strengthening of unity in the OAU which  the Angolan tragedy so clearly threatens. In  our view  this meeting should start by ex~  aminJng the objective reality of the situa tion by looking at the whole issue from at  least three angles:    (a) The history of the Angolan struggle  and OAU attitude to it;  (b) What the current situation is in An gola and what Angolans and we Africans  gathered here want;  (c) What  Africa's  collective  position  should be  in order to resolve  the probl'em  within the OAU context.  The OAU recognized the three nationalist  ",1976
75,,94,0.601,979,2,Mr. ROUSSELOT.," Mr. Speaker, cer tainly we all remember the story of the  ""Little Red Hen"" from our childhood. We  recall how the energetic little hen went  about her wo1k. gathering  the gi'ain,  planting the wheat, baking the bread,  and wisely performing the duties with  industry and prudence. We can also  remember that the enterprising red hen  received no help from her lazy and unin spired fliends,  the cow..  the duck,  the  pig, and the goose. When ask-ed to help  with the preparation of her bread, they  were always quick to produce some likely  excuse such as ""I'm tired,, or ""I have  better things to do'~ or .. I'll help some  other time."" Though they were unwilling  to help the little red hen in the nece~ary  preparations of the bread. when it was  finished and ready to eat, they were more  than anxious to help the practical and  understanding  little red hen consume  her prize.  But alas and alack, what was her re ward? I  invite my colleagues to read a  modern version of the ""Little Red Hen""  which appeared in the December 2, 1975  edition of  the Wall Street Journal. A  version created by the Pennwalt Corp.,  the story has important application to  the economy and cet1iain trends that we  can see in our country today:  THE MODERN LITTLE RED liEN  time. there was a little red  Once upon a  hen who scratched about the barnyard until  she uncovered some grains {)f wheat. She  called her neighbors and said., ""'If we plant  this wheat, we shall have bread to eat. Who  will help me plant it?""  ""Not I,"" said the cow~  ""Not I,"" said the duck.

""That would be overtime i.or me .. "" said th.e  cow.  ""I'd lose my welfare benefits/' said  duck.  ""I'm a dropout and never learned bow,""  said the pig.  ""If I'm to be the helper~ that'.s discrimina tion,"" said the goose.  ""Then I w1ll,"" said the Jiit1e red ben.  She baked five  loaves and held them up  for her nelghbor.s to .see.    They all wanted some, tn fact,. demanded a  share. But the Uttle red hen zatd, ""No,  can eat the five loaves myself.""  ~~Excess profits!"" cried \he oow.  ""capitalist leech,,. screamed. the duck.  ""I de.mand equal rigbts:t'' yelled the goose.  And the pig just ,grunted. And they painted  ""unfair"" picket signs and .mardled around  anci  round  the  little  rec1  ben,  -shouting  obsceniti-es.  When  the government agent came, he  said to the little red hen. ""You must not  I  be greedy.""  ""But I earned the bread./' said the little  red hen.  ""Exactly,"" said  the agent. ""That is  the  wonderful free enterprise system.

76,Senate,94,-0.42,992,2,Mr. HARTKE.," Mr. President, I intro duce, by request, for appropriate refer ence, on behalf of myself and Senator  PEARSON, a. bill to amend the Interstate  Commerce Act, as amended, to increase  efficiency and competition and to reduce  costs  in the motor carrier industry by  allowing easier entry and greater price  flexibility and by removing excessive and  wasteful regulation, and for other pur poses, and I ask unanimous consent that  the section-by-section analysis be printed  in the REcoRD together with the text of  the bill.  There being no objection, the bill and  analysis were ordered to be printed in  the REcoRD, as follows:  s. 2929  1.  of  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives  the United States  of  America  in Congress assembled, That this  Act may be cited as the ""Motor Carrier Re form Act"".

77,Senate,94,-0.091,1005,2,Mr. TALMADGE.," Mr. President, the  United States International Trade Com mission has conducted a shrimp hearing  in Savannah, Ga. I have earlier com mended the USITC for  its progressive  and innovative approach exemplified by  taking many of its investigative hear ings out of Washington and to the peo ple. The significance of  the Savannah  hearing is enhanced by the fact that the  Commission was able to obtain about 2%  days worth of testimony in 1 day with  more than 30 witnesses. This accomplish ment was possible because the Commis sion met until 12:14 this morning. By  taking this unusual step of meeting until  every witness had been heard, the Com mission was able to accommodate in 1  day's time all witnesses, many of whom  had indicated that they wanted to testify,  but could not come back for a second or  third day.  At 12:14 a.m. when the three Com missioners, Daniel Minchew, Joseph 0.  Parker, and Italo H. Ablondi, conducting  this hearing concluded  the Savannah,  Ga., proceedings, they set a new record  for a USITC hearing under the provi sions of the new Trade Act. In addition  tv the convenience to the public, this ap proach has the benefit of portraying a  very important Government agency and  its staff in a most favorable light. It is  not often that I have seen a commission  or committee meet nonstop until mid night, without even taking time for sup per, in order to accommodate the general  public.    This is the type Government service  that portrays a Washington agency at  its best and is an example of hard work  and sincere feeling for service  to  the  public which others should imitate.  FW'thermore, I believe that by com pressing. a 3-day hearing  into 1 day,  money has been saved not only for the  Federal Government, but also  for  the  more than 30 witnesses who participated.  Because of the unusually fine example  of the Government being responsive to  the public I want to express personal  commendation to Commissioners Daniel  Minchew,  Joseph 0. Parker,  Italo H.  Ablondi, and their staff, Ms. Katherine  Meleky, Ms. Mary DrW'y, Mr. Thomas G.  Lopp, Mr. Frederick H. Sontag, and Mr.  Josiah o. Hatch.  GETTING OUT OF THE DES MESS  ",1976

79,Senate,94,0.322,1031,2,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I have taken  a careful look at the measure pending  before the Senate today, and have re viewed the majority and minority views  expressed by members of the Senate In terior Committee at the time that the  bill was reported. On balance, it seems  to me that S. 2371 has a much more det rimental potential for our Nation in the  years  to come  than it does beneficial  qualities.  It is very important that our national  scenic treasures are preserved as near as  possible in their natural State, and I cer tainly do not advocate eliminating the  current prohibitions against mining in  national parks and monuments. How ever, previous Congresses have cited six  specific  areas which  contain valuable  mineral deposits and have granted a very  limited  exception  to  the  restriction  against mining  in national monument  areas. In particular, these include Glacier  Bay National Monument, Death Valley  National Moument, Crater Lake  and  Mount McKinley National Parks, Coro nado National Memorial, and Oregon  Pipe Cactus Monument. Of  approxi mately 120 national parks and national  monuments, only  these six have been  deemed so valuable, under previous legis lation, that restricted mineral explora tion and extraction have been permitted.  As several members of the Senate Inin  terior Committee noted in their minority  statement, it appears doubtful that Con gress now has either the legal or ethical  right  to deprive mineral producers  these areas of  their property without  just compensation.  But  the overriding consideration  in  this issue, it seems to me, is the extreme  value of minerals contained  in  these  specific areas to future national develop ment and even national defense. Evi dence indicates that these six areas con tain at least 14 valuable minerals that  the Bureau of Mines forecasts will be in  short supply within the next 25 years.  Glacier Bay National Monument, for ex ample, contains approximately 1 billion  pounds of nickel-the largest known de posit in the United States. It contains  600 million pounds of copper as well.  Death Valley contains the only known  significant domestic reserves of the high  grade borate, colemanite. Nickel is astra tegic metal essential to the $25 billion  iron and steel industry as well as to the  aerospace  industry.  It  is currently  in  such short supply within  the United  States that our Government imports over  70 percent of the nickel used domesti cally, and this amount is steadily increas ing. Yet, S. 2371 will effectively withdraw  another 7 million acres of potentially  mineral-rich land from our ever-dimin ishing supply of mineral resources.  Probably the most concerning aspect  of our domestic mineral shortage is the  knowledge that our Nation's growin.g de pendence on mineral imports from for eign countries puts us in a position of  vulnerability, not unlike that we have  experienced  in  the area of petroleum  needs. The U.S. Geological Survey has  forecast that within the next 25 years,  the United States will be 100 percent de pendent on imports for 12 essential min eral commodities, more than 75 percent  dependent  for 15  such minerals, and  more than 50 percent dependent for 26  commodities. There can be no question  that our Nation's reliance and depend ence on the whims of foreign govern ments will be increased by every acre of  mineral-rich land that we now close to  exploration and development.  The measure we confront today does  not in any way propose to open our na tional parks and monuments to mining  activities. I certainly would not support  any such sweeping initiative which would  have such a tragic effect upon our valu able scenic preserves and monuments. I  do believe it is of primary importance  that  these national  treasures be pre served for our generation and for future  generations.  But Congress should carefully weigh  the extremely important and detrimental  repercussions which can result if these  limited mineral developments, which are  currently permitted by  law, should be  terminated at this time.  Mr. President, I am hopeful that the  Members of  this body will agree  this  morning to permit these limited mining  activities to continue in these six areas,  so  that our critical national mineral  needs can be met.

86,House,94,-0.313,1161,2,Mr. COTTER.," Mr. Speaker, Connecti cut has lost a valuable citizen. My good  friend. Scott McAlister died  last week  at the young age of 45. I knew Scott as  a friend and competitor. but will remem ber him as a free spirit dedicated to the  betterment of his city, State, and Nation.  Scott's most public role was president  and member of the Hartford Board of  Education. He will be long remembered  for his dedication  to what he always  called his citys  greatest resource-our  children. But he did most more  than  serve on the board during his active pub lic life. He was a trustee of the Hartford  Public Library. president of the Hartford  Stage Co.'s board of directors. and a  member of the city charter revision com mittee. He  actively  supported  every  candidate he considered the best for his   country, State, and city. Nearly every one  o.f those candidates gained from Scott's  special abilities.  It is the measure of the man and our  deep loss that his work was not confined  to his outstanding service in Hartford.  At the age of 31, Scott had already  served as a speechwriter to a candidate  for Governor of Connecticut. Through out the 1960's he was active on the local  and national level; serving as a regional  coordinator in a major Presidential cam paign in 1968. In business, Scott found  the same level of success. rising to be come executive vice president and assist ant to the chairman of the Covenant Life  Insw:ance Co. Before entering private  business. he had been assistant dean for  the University of Connecticut School of  Business.  Scott McAlister's work on the Hart ford Board of Education won him much  praise and adriliration. As president of  the board, he never  lost sight of his  primary  goal-service  to  Hartford's  children.  Though  a  Republican  in  Democratic Hartford, Scott McAlister's  ",1976
87,,94,-0.192,1187,2,Mr. RUSSO.," Mr . .Speaker. last week  the House of Representatives by a vote  of 246 to 124 adopted a resolution that  effectively permits the President to de lete material from a report of the House  Select Committee on Intelligence that  he determines is contrary to the nation al  interest. Although  .supported  the  amendment proposed by the Committee  on Rules, I did so with considerable re luctance, because I felt the Members of  the House were pr-esented with a poor  choice no matter which way they decided  to vote.  From the numerous facts  that have  be'm leaked to the press and from discus sions with my colleagues who are respon sible for oversight of the Central Intel ligence Agency it is clear that the CIA  has engaged in activities that are repre hensible  to a  free society. The secret  bombing of Cambodia and the plot to  as::;assinate Cuban Dictator Fidel Castro,  as my  colleague  fl'Om Colorado  JoHNsoN) pointed out in debate, were  certainly known to the Cambodians who  were being bombed and by Castro whom  they were attempting to kill. The only  people who did not know about this ac tivity were the American people and the  Congress of the United States~  I am troubled by the Rules Committee  amendment which in my view abdicates  congressional  oversight  responsibility.  My good friend from Illinois <Mr. M""UR PHY) ~highlighted this issue in the well of  (Mr.  the House with these words;  If we are not a coequal branch of  this  Governm.ent, if we are not equal to the Presi dent and the Supreme Court. then let the  CIA write this report; and we ought to .fold  our tent and go home, or go swimmlng, or go  golfing, because people are saying, ""Where  were you Congress?""  .. . The Constitution directs the Members  to oversee the purse of this country, the tax payers' money. It is a responstbfllty we should  not take lightly.  Mr. Speaker, nine of the members of  the House Select Committee on Inte111gence voted  to  release  this 1eport as  written immediately without Presidential  or CIA censorship. No one of us can dis pute the Integrity or the patriotism of  those members. They have proceeded 1l:1  to  the  a responsible n1anner in a very difficult  situation.  The security of the United States and  our citizens is the No. 1 priority we ha-ve  .as elected public otncials~ The Central  Intelligence Agency has been involved 1n  this significant and dangerous work far  almost 30 years and all in all they have  performed honorably and courageously.  The current atmosphere of suspicion and  accusation must subside if the Congress,  the Executive. and the people are to ad equately respect the important mission  of the CIA. N-ewspaper leaks, publication  of the names of CIA officers, and other  irresponsible acts must cease if the CIA  is to do its job. We must make sure we  do not weaken the CIA, but strengthen it  and  correct  any  abuses  contrary  democracy.  Yet, the Congress must have knowl edge of what the CIA is doing and what  overall policy directions the CIA Js pur suing. Last week's Yote continued  separation that has existed between the  Congress and the President over this is we. That vote did not permit us to re view the information that the President  wants to suppress. The Members simply  did not know whether this material would  harm the national interest as the Presi dent .suggested. The Members of  the  House were placed in an impossible posi tion-Vote ""yes"" and abandon congres sional responsibility, v,ote ""no   and take  the chance that information harmful to  the national security  interests of  United States would be released. I would  have preferred an executive session of  the House of Representatives so  that  Members eould hear and judge f,or them selves the disputed material in the Pike  committee report.  I supported the CIA and the President  with my vote, because of my belief that  any potential threat to the national se curity of our country should be avoided at  all costs. The  issues  involved  week's debate must no-t be forgotten. The  liberties .of the American people cannot  be trampled by any ann of Government.  In additi.on, the Congress as the elected  Representativ-es of  the people cannot  turn their backs ,on their legitimate over sight responsibilities. To protect our free dom we must all be vigilant. To safe guard the security of the American peo ple the proper role of intelligence activi ties must be clearly defined with vigilant  and thoughtful congressional oversight  of Executive action.  in last  the  TENNESSEE BICENTENNIAL DAY  OBSERVED IN WASHINGTON  HON.

88,,94,-0.343,1187,2,Mr. EVINS of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  Tuesday was Tennessee Bicentennial  Day in the Nation's capital and the Vol unteer State was honored by the desig nation of Tuesday as ""Tennessee Day""  by Mayor Walter Washington of Washington and by a ntimber of other.events.  The Mayor's proclama,tion was  acI  of  'WhO  HOWARD  pointed out  cepted by Gov. Ray Blauton of Tennessee  in ceremonies Tuesday morning in the  rotunda of the Russell Building, As dean  of the Tennessee oongressional delega it was my pleasure  tion,  to introduce  members of the Tennessee delegation in  attendance-Senators  BAKER  and BILL  BROCK  -and Representative  MARILYN  LLOYD  llf Chattanooga,  made brief remarks concerning the noble  history,  heritage  and  traditions  Tennessee.  In my  remarks,  that  Tennessee has an illus'trious history, hav ing provided the Nation with three Pres idents-Andrew Jackson, Andrew John son, and James K. Polk. P.resident Polk  was the only Speaker of the Rouse to  achieve the Nation's highest office.  Tennessee was settled in large part by  veterans of the Revolutionary War who  were given land grants as payment for  their service in the Revolutionary War.  As I also pointed out to Mayor Washing ton and others attending the ceremony  in the rotunda, perhaps this ancestry of  courage and valor explains why Ten nessee became known .as the Volunteer  State with its men willing to volunteer  to defend and protect the United States  in wars fought for freedom, liberty and  the cherished American way of life.  The master of ceremonies .at the ro tunda was Dr. A. K. Stanley, .executive  director, District of Columbia Bicen tennial office.  Following the ceremony in the rotunda,  there was a luncheon in the Raybm'!l  Building where Mrs. Walter Washington,  representing the Mayor, spoke eloquently  of the illustrious history of Tennessee.  The Fisk Jubilee Singers entertained  with beautiful renditions of such patr1otie songs as ""'This Is My Country.'' The  Country cavaliers of Nashville, a musical  group; also played patriotic songs.  Jonathan Ross, a fifth grade student  at Kingsman Elementary School, recited  a poem which he had written about Ten nessee. Students at Kingsman Elemen tary School, Maury Elementary School  and Miner Elementary School composed  poems about Tennessee which were com piled and printed in a  folder available  to those attending the luncheon. These  schools are located near Tennessee Ave nue in Washington.  The poem by Jonathan Ross  follows:  as  is  TENNESSEE  Have you heard of the State of TeniH~ssce?  With its land and skies and sea  Beckoning us :to come and 'Share  All o:r the culture that.lsiound th.ere.  Its population is more than a few,  And there is so awfully much to do  To keep its name as the ""Big Bend State""  Alive and true and up-to-date.  How wonderful it is for Volunteers  To fight for the land that is theirs.  No wonder it is known also as the ""Voluntee1  State.""  These are  the  things  that has made her  great.  Another excellent poem was recited by  Howard Benson, 9 years of age, a fourth -grader at Miner Elementary School.  This poem is as follows:  TENNESSEE  There are many streets 1n our clty   Some large, narrow and old,   -Streets that are named af'ter states,  ",1976

90,House,94,-0.128,10,9,Mr. SIKES.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I want to discuss the  precision  location  strike  system,  the  abbreviated  form  for which  is PLSS.  The House committee cut $10 million  from  this program.  It was budgeted  at $30 milllon. The amount carried in  the bill is $20 million. This action was  taken, not because of lack of support for  the program, but because the committee  was not satisfied with the progress and  planning of certain elements of the pro gram. There is an obvious need to insure  that this system is developed to its full  potential as ~apidly as possible. This pro gram originated out of our experiences in  Southeast Asia where a relatively unso phisticated surface-to-air missile system,  the SA-2,  shot down  a  considerable  number of our aircraft. That missile  system was first fielded nearly two dec ades ago. Since then our potential adver saries have fielded many more sophisti cated and deadly air defense systems.  Their lethality was dramatically demon strated in the most recent Middle East  crisis, where  new  precision weapons  nearly cost the Israelis a war.  The PLSS is aimed at insuring that we  field a modern tactical system to counter  the projected surface air defense threats  expected in Europe in the 1980's. This  system will have new capability to pin point radar-directed missile and anti aircraft artillery systems in seconds. It  also provides precision all-weather weap",1976
91,House,94,-0.184,23,9,Mr. RANDALL.,"  To  continue, Mr.  Chairman, the Chinese were pragmatic  because they saw that what was going on  in the Korean Peninsula was an effort in  the foreseeable future toward a strength ening South Korea.  So much for that. The pivotal state to day in the Pacific is Japan. Japan has  always  traditionally  been  concerned  about this Korean Peninsula. They have  sometimes described it as ""a dagger at  our heart.'' Certainly the Japanese are  watching our involvement in the Pacific.  Japan, because of its flexibility and inde pendence, is far too important for us to  even consider the removal of any troops  from South Korea.  The gentleman from California <Mr.  DELLUMS)  a moment ago made some  comment about the troops in Korea and  the situation of the South Koreans them selves. What he omitted or neglected to  say was that the South Koreans are now  embarked upon a 5-year program of im proving their own forces. That perhaps  addresses itself to the fact of why this is  such a strong reason it is the wrong time  to off er this amendment. That is so be cause with just a little help the South  Koreans may be able to improve them selves in the next year.  ",1976

93,House,94,0.134,36,9,Mrs. FENWICK.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I ris-3 in support of the  amendment, but I have a question. I am  heartily in favor of  the 3-year notice  when an installation is to be closed down;  but I am puzzled, because what we are  saying in the language of the amendment  is that no funds shall be used to close or  diminish any base up to 50 percent, un less notice was given 3 years and 1 month  ago. Could we not say that without 3  years  notification,  no  base  shall  be  closed? Would not that solve it?  ",1976
94,House,94,-0.383,36,9,Mr. TSONGAS.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word, and I rise in sup port of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I think we ought to put  this issue in some perspective. We are not  talking about stopping  the closing of  bases in the long term. What we are talk ing about  is very  simple:  study and  notice.  Let me give the Members an example  of something that went right in Mas sachusetts. In November 1974,  the De partment of Defense  announced  that  Hanscom Air Force Base was going to  be  transferred, and  it involved Rome,  N.Y., and Albuquerque. They had not  done the study previous to the time that  they announced it.  We called upon the Secretary of the  Air Force--Mr. McLucas at that time--to  have a blue ribbon committee look into  the issue. They said that it does not make  any sense. As a result of that, the facility  in Hanscom stayed, the facility in Rome  stayed,  the  facility  in Albuquerque  stayed.  What that blue ribbon committee said,  in effect, to the Secretary was that the  decision of November 1974, was neither  good for the Air Force nor was it good  for the country, and it was reversed. That  is what this amendment is all about. If,  indeed, the study suggests that the base  should be closed, then so be it. At least,  the community will have passed to have  the  transitional studies so  that it can  recover from the closing.  Let me just add a word to those Mem bers who are not from New England. This  amendment actually serves New England  less than any other part of the country  for  the very simple reason that we do  not have that much more to lose. Every thing  that has been up  there for  the  most part has been taken out. It is the  other areas in the future that at least  have the threat of being subjected to the  same kind of dislocation we have suffered  for the last 7 years. Whether this goes  through or not is going to be of lesser  impact on New England, but of major  impact on the country.  We are saying to the other Members,  ""We know what it is like, we know what  the dislocation is like."" This is a meth od for other areas, a chance  to avoid  those dislocations, so actually it is ironic  that it is more in the interests of other  Members than it is of New England to  see that this amendment goes through.  Mr. Chairman, I ask that the amend ment be overwhelmingly adopted.  ",1976
95,House,94,-0.479,36,9,Mr. CARNEY.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1976
96,House,94,0.398,36,9,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Chairman,  move to strike the requisite number of  words, and  I  rise  in oposition  to  the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, let me say that I am  very sympathetic with  the gentleman  from Massachusetts  <Mr. O'NEILL).  agree with what he  is  trying  to do.  If by some legerdemain here the date  had not been made, where this is not  permissible,  but  this  absolutely  pro hibits  any  closure,  because we  have  a date set 3 years ago. There is no way  one can give notice now 3 years ago,  and that is what this amendment would  do.  Next to my home county there is an  Air Force base which  the DOD  an nounced  its  closure.  It  is  in Dallas  County. It is estimated that one-third  of  the entire economy of  this county  hinges around Craig Air Force Base.  There is no telling what the ripple effect  would be. Perhaps as much as one-half  of all the economy hinges around this  Air Force base. They have announced its  closure.  If this would require an impact study,  and  then we pass on what  the study  shows, the Congress would have a say-so,  fine, I applaud that. And if the majority  leader would propose to do this through  our committee, I would do everything to  accelerate passage of it and vote for it.  But this particular amendment we are  discussing  is an  impossibility.  It says  if you do not give notice 3 years ago,  there will be no base closures.  Mr. Chairman, to my friends on that  side of the aisle who have been scream ing, hollering, and shouting about econ in cutting defense expenditures,  but this is not the way to do it.  Mr. O'NEil.L. Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1976

103,Senate,94,0.283,140,9,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President, I send to  the desk an amendment to S. 3219, the  Clean Air Amendments of 1976, and ask  that it be printed. This amendment, on  which I am pleased to be joined by two  of my colleagues, Mr. BucKLEY and Mr.  STAFFORD, is designed to assure fair com petition in  the auto-parts aftermarket  industry,  to  assure  that  independent  manufacturers, dealers, and service sta tions are freed of any anticompetitive  dangers in this law. This is an amend ment that I believe I can fairly charac terize as placing the interests of the con sumer first. It will continue the existence  of an adequate warranty against failure  in the emissions system of automobiles,  while assuring that the consumer can  obtain the best deal going on auto repair  work, without infringing the warranty.  I would also like to point out that the  provision now in the Senate bill includes  a study by the Federal Trade Commis sion. This study will examine whether  any aspects of  the warranty provision  contained in the law might have any aspects of  the warranty provision con tained in the law might have any effects  that the Congress should address.  As our amendment is described in some  detail in the individuai views that are in cluded with Senate Report 94-717, I do  not intend to go into a lengthy explana tion at this time. I would adc one com ment of explanation. Some question has  been raised over the meaning of the term  ""design life"" in the amendment. ""Design  life"" means the length of time that is  the designated replacement interval in  the maintenance instructions that must  be  issued under  the  terms of section  207(c) (3).  I  ask unanimous  consent  views be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the views  were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  that our  INDIVIDUAL VIEWS OF SENATORS BAKER,  BUCKLEY, AND STAFFORD  One of the more controversial issues that  has arisen with this bill involves the rela tionship between the automotive warranty  requirements  in present law and the need  to assure fair and free competition in the  servicing of autoanobiles.  Reasonable pressure must be kept on the  automobile industry to assure the cars which  consumers buy actually meet the clean-air  standards when sold, and then continue to  meet  those standards. But we are equally  firm in recognizing the need to prevent any  anticompetitive effects resulting in the auto  servicing business.  To balance those forces, the Committee has  included five specific provisions in this bill:  Sections 25, 27, 28, 29, and 39. We support  those sections. The full description of these  provisions in the report states accurately the  problem and the major improvements pro vided by this bill. But to protect further the  right of the consumer to have repair work  done wherever he chooses, we shall also offer  an amendment that we believe perfects the  intent of the Act.  This aanendment is necessary because of  the strong conviction remaining among some  representatives  of  the  independent  auto  parts and service industry that the Clean Air  warranty could drive business into the shops  of the car dealers. That is not the intent of  the Committee. That will not be the effect  of this bill.  The first part of our amendment is a sub stitute for the provisions of section 27, which  requires prepayment for any device ""princi pally"" for pollution control that costs $75  or more; we require that such prepayment  extend only to items such as the catalytic  muffier and that the price be based on a  percentage of the car's sale price, rather than  a fixed dollar amount.  The second part of our amendment makes  clear that it is the car owner's responsibility  to maintain his car properly. It makes ex plicit what  is now  implicit in the law. It  will be  the responsibility of the owner  to  have this maintenance done on parts that  have a design life less than the 50,000 mile  ""useful life"" of the car, such as spark plugs  or motor oil. We reiterate that maintenance  work may be done wherever the owner wishes,  without jeopard1Z1ng the owner's rights under  the warranty.  An illustration may prove helpful: Spark  plugs, which may have a  listed design life  of 12,500 miles, may need to be replaced on  a particular car at 14,000 miles. It has been  argued, incorrectly we believe, that the war ranty requires the car owner to return to his  dealer to have those spark plugs replaced. It  is the intent of present law-and it is spelled  out in our a.mendment--that the owner car ries the responsibility for this work, which  can be done anywhere the owner wishes. If  the owner does not make those needed re placements, and that failure is the reason the  car fails an air-standards test, then that is  evidence of improper maintenance, voiding  the warranty. Thus, our amendment should  encourage wise and proper maintenance of  cars.  An alternative approach suggested by oth ers would reduce the warranty term to 18,000  miles. We believe that would be unwise. It  would enable  the automotive  industry  to  relax  its quality control to the point that  cars in use become far heavier sources of  pollution. It would increase the burden on  the consumer to have cars brought back into  compliance at the consumer's expense.  Under an 18,000-mile warranty,  the con sumer could be hit with costly repairs if the  consumer must bring his car into compliance  with  the standards after 18,000 miles. By  assuring that the responsib1lity rests on the  manufacturer for 50,000 miles, the law en courages the auto industry to maintain its  quality control at a high level, while giving  the consumer a reasonable right against the  manufacturer.  ",1976
104,Senate,94,-0.374,296,9,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, I  rise in  support of  the amendment to  increase  the agriculture budget ceilings-func tion 350-in Senate Concurrent Resolu tion 109 by $100 million in budget au thority and by $150 million for outlays.  I am in complete agreement with what  my colleagues on the Committee on Ag riculture and Forestry as  the need,  and I wish to lend my concurrence to  their observations.  These are critical programs for every  American and programs that cannot be  postponed.  Over half of  the increase  in budget  authority that the Committee on Agri culture recommended would go  to  the  for  research on pressing,  local  problems; problems in agr:culture that  can only be solved with  localized  re search and extension efforts.  One of the most important eff or~ that  we have called for is forestry research  and extension-a long neglected aspect  of-our natural resources. This renewable  resource must be carefully cultivated to day if our Nation is  to have adequate  States  to  forest resources tomorrow. It is an area  that can benefit our small farmers. It  would provide them with supplemental  income while improving our environment,  conserving our resources and maximiz ing the long-term welfare of our Nation.  We are also calling for some additional  funding for the expanded nutrition and  family education program. This is a vi tally important program that not only  delivers needed nutrition education but  means thousands of needed jobs in the  poverty areas of both rural and urban  America.  There are also  funds  for our small  farmers  research  and  extension pro grams which I think are absolutely im perative. In our Bicentennial Year,  I  cannot  ignore  the  principles  of  the  Founding Fathers and their belief that  our family farms and our natural re sources are the basis of a strong demo cratic society.  Mr. President, I urge that this amend ment be adopted to Senate Concurrent  Resolution 109.  ",1976
105,Senate,94,0.016,296,9,Mr. ALLEN.," Mr. President, a  large  share of the programs within function  350, are directly under the Subcommittee  on Agricultural Research and General  Legislation, of which I am chairman.  I can assure you that the funding lev els  recommended  by  the Agriculture  Committee  in  its  budget  report  of  March 15, were not arrived at in a casual  manner. We established  those  recom mendations after long and careful delib eration of the needs and priorities.  In addition, I want to point out that  a significant number of the so-called in creases that we recommended are really  restorations of programs that the administration would eliminate or reduce  in ill-advised fashions.  Equally important, we were attempting to  restore  the reductions  that the  infiatjon has wrought in the past several  years--we wanted  to restore these im portant programs in real terms to what  they were 10 years ago.  Foremost among the areas of our con cern is agricultural research. The ap",1976
106,Senate,94,0.307,309,9,Mr. BELLMON.," According to Senator  KENNEDY'S amendment, there will be an  increased deficit of $1.8 billion. This def icit is the result of including $700 mil lion more revenue and $700 million less  welfare expenditure.  It is not correct to now say that the  budget  impact  is $400 million because  the $700 million greater tax revenue and  $700 million less welfare expenditure are  to be taken from the $1.8 billion deficit.  To add $700 million more revenue and  subtract $700 million less expenditure is  to  count  the same dollar  twice. The  added deficit $1.8 billion, not $0.4 billion.  ",1976
107,Senate,94,-0.344,309,9,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. President, before  nightfall,  the Senate will vote on  the  passage of  the first concurrent resolu tion on the budget for fiscal 1977. The  vote wiL. mark the the initiation of the  formal and comprehensive effort of Con gress  to establish budget priorities for  the coming fiscal year.  Mr. President, the Budget Committee  members, and in particular  its distin guished chairman (Mr. MUSKIE) and its  distinguished ra:::iking minority member  (Mr. BELLMON), deserve  the thanks of  the Senate for their earnest and con certed consideration of national priori ties  under  exceptionally  difficult  circumstances. The care with which they  prepared  their  recommendations  has  provided  a  solid  foundation  for  the  Senate decision we are about to make.  The implications of the Senate's deci sion can be-and in these crucial times,  certainly will be-vast and far-reaching  At i:.take is the recovery oi the American  economy  from  the worst  recession  in  40 years. The well-being and aspirations  of millions of Americans will  rise or  decline as our budget decisions dictate.  In making our priorities  choices, we  cannot afford to be v:rong.  The Senate Budget Committee has  given us  its  recommendations, which  culminate  an  arduous  and  detailed  budget process that involved every Com mittee of Congresb. The Committee on  Labor and Public Welfare, which I have  the privilege  to chair, conducted an  exhaustive study of the Federal activi ties within our jurisdiciton so that we  would be fully prepared to make our own  recommendations. By a committee vote  of 15  sive repart of our views and estimates  for  the vital  employment,  education,  to 1, we approved a  comprehenheal th, and poverty programs, as well  as  the programs  for  the  aging,  the  ",1976
108,House,94,-0.139,335,9,Mr. WHALEN.," Mr. Speaker, I move to  strike the requisite numbers of words.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  12132, which extends  the Distrirt of  Columbia Medical and Manpower Act  of  1970  for an additional year. The  purpose of  this bill  is  to continue for  1 more year the :financial distress fund ing which we have provided in the form  of Federal capitation grants for two of  the District's  private medical-dental  schools, Geogetown and George Wash ington Universities. With  the average  annual cost of a medical education now  well in excess of $12,650 per student, both  the schools and the students are hard  pressed to continue their programs, and  could not do  so without  substantial  Federal assistance. The grants provided  in this legislation are to be in the mini mum amounts necessary. They may not  exceed, in fiscal year 1977, $5,000 per en rolled medical student and $3,000 per en rolled dental student. These amounts ap pear reasonable in view of the fact that  the average State support of publicly  operated medical schools is $6,973.  Most States which have private medi cal or dental schools provide financial  assistance of this kind. My own State of  Ohio, for example, provides on the aver age of $5,400 per student. The grants au thorized by this bill can fairly be con sidered as a substitute for State funding  available  to  those medical  schools  in  other jurisdictions.  I think that it is also important to con sider the fact that these two fine schools  of medicine are valuable national as well  as community resources. They operate  emergency services on a 24-hour basis  and contribute vital inpatient and outpatient facilities for both area residents  and visitors from all of the States also,  these two schools have also provided 10,775 doctors and dentists who are now  practicing in 50 States and the District  of Columbia. Moreover, 47 States and the  District are represented by the present  student bodies of the two schools.  In addition  to  these nationwide ad vantages, we also have the consideration  of  the ""Federal presence""  role of  the  District of Columbia and the added bur den on all of  the District's resources  which this entails. Moreover, we are all  by now a ware of the dim.cult financial  problems that the District now faces, and  for which the Congress is now actively  seeking  viable  solutions. Thus,  it  is  simply unrealistic  to expect  the city  to provide this funding at the present  time, and there appears to be no chance  that it will do so.  Finally, both Georgetown and George  Washington expect to have in place a  permanent long-term loan program by  the fall of 1977 which will satisfy this  present financial need. The presidents  of both universities have stated in writ ing that they will not request a further  extension of this legislation beyond fiscal  year 1977.  In summary, Mr. Speaker, the District  of Columbia is finanoially incapable of  supporting these two vital medical and  dental education and health care institu tions. Without a  temparary extension  of  the  present District of Columbia  Medical and Manpower Act, both schools  may be required to close their doors. In asmuch as both schools are committed  to seek future financing through a stu dent loan assistance program, I  firmly  believe that the extension of this fund ing legislation for 1 more year is in the  best interests of this Federal comm.unity  and the entire Nation.  ",1976
109,House,94,-0.186,335,9,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Speaker, I move  to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Speaker, this is a very awkward  position for me to be in personally be cause I oppose this bill, H.R. 12132, a bill  to extend the District of Columbia Medi cal and Dental Manpower Act of 1970.  That is like opposing  the Fourth of  July and apple pie, because how can one  oppose a bill that is going to bring money  to two very worthy institutions to pro vide medical and dental education?  Let me assure the House, first, that I  have the highest regard for both of these  institutions. They are great assets to our  community and to our Nation. Further more, from a personal standpoint, my son  is a  student at Gonzaga High School  which, of course,  is operated by  the  Jesuit Fathers. So obviously, I have more  than just a small amount of fealty to the  Jesuits who  also operate Georgetown  University.  The original legislation in 1970 made  available a maximum of $5,000 per medi cal student and a maximum of $3,000 per  dental student to Georgetown and George  Washington Universities.  The rationale for the legislation orig inally was that some other private med ical/ dental schools received financial as sistance from their State governments.  ",1976

114,House,94,0.087,348,9,Mr. ANDREWS of North Dakota.," Mr.  Speaker, my colleague, the chairman of  the subcommittee, the gentleman from  Mississippi, Mr. WHITTEN, described it  essentially as it is.  No money would be saved by going  along with the action of the President in  this case. In fact, money would proba bly be wasted by continuing the deferral  these expenses have to be in because  curred to protect the communities from  the :floods.  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the  resolution.  Mr. McDADE. Mr. Speaker, last au tumn northeastern Pennsylvania was  ravaged by  :flooding caused by Hurri cane Eloise. Although damages were not  limited to my congressional district, the  Susquehanna River Basin was one of the  hardest hit areas.  Immediately  following  the  :flooding  my omce began receiving  requests for  the funds under the Soil Conservation  Service's emergency watershed protec tion program, ""section 216.""  This is the only Federal program for  emergency stream clearance and erosion  prevention.  However, at the  time of Hurricane  Eloise,  this ""emergency program,"" be cause of its archaic funding mechanism,  had no money available to assist areas  victimized by Eloise.  In November,  the Agriculture Sub committee, under the able leadership of  Chairman JAMIE L. WHITTEN, responded  quickly to my request for additional SCS  funds. The chairman was successful in  bringing an amendment to final passage  in the supplemental in less than a week.  The Senate quickly followed suit and by  the first of  this year there was $26.4  million available nationally for this SCS  emergency program. This  included $3  million for  the State of Pennsylvania.  The immediate response on the part  of Congress meant funds were available  and planning could begin immediately  to repair the damage caused by Eloise.  Indeed, in my district, which has been  designated to receive approximately two thirds of the $3 million appropriated for  Pennsylvania, plans are underway which  could produce project starts as early as  July.  In this light, I  find it inoomprehensible that the administration could recom mend a deferral of $18 million for this  program. This  deferral  includes  million-one-half  of  the  emergency  Junds appropriated for flood recovery in  $1.5  ",1976
115,House,94,-0.481,361,9,Mr. REUSS.," Mr. Speaker, Congressman  REES, chairman of the Subcommittee on  International Trade,  Investment,  and  Monetary Policy, Congressman ST GER MAIN, chairman of the Subcommittee on  Financial Institutions Supervision, Regu lation, and Insurance, and I are intro ducing the International Banking Act of  1976. What follows is an explanation of  the contents of this legislation.  Section 101, definitions.  Section 102, establishment of national  banks: The Comptroller of the Currency  is authorized to permit up to one-third  of the directors of foreign banks in the  United States  to be non-U.S. citizens.  The Comptroller is also granted author ity to deny a foreign banking application  in the United States if he determines,  after consultation with the Secretary of  State, Secretary of the Treasury, and the  Federal Reserve Board of Governors, that  it would not be in the interests of the  United States  to permit the requested  banking activity.  Section 103, edge corporations: This  permits foreign banks to own Edge Act  corporations-domestic banking offices  engaging in foreign trade transactions upon approval by the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System after con sultation with the Secretary of the Treas ury and the Secretary of State and a  determination that this would not ad versely aff eet  the domestic or foreign  commerce of the United States.  Section 104, Federal branches: The  Comptroller is given authority to author ize the establishment of Federal branches  of foreign banks in States where they are  not prohibited by State  law. Federal  branch operations will generally be sub ject to the same duties, restrictions, and  conditions that would apply if it were a  national bank doing business at the same  location. Foreign banks are permitted to  convert  State-chartered  branches  Federal branches.  Section 105, branching across State  lines: Foreign banks are prohibited from  branching or establishing agencies across  State lines unless the branch or agency is  approved by the State banking authori ties in both the bank's home State and  the State in which the foreign bank seeks  to establish the new branch or agency.  Additionally, all branches of the foreign  bank  in  all States must be Federal  branches. Branches operating in more  to  CXXII--668-Part 9  than one State on or before December 3,  1974, are ""grandfathered"" provided they  convert  to a Federal branch within 2  years of the date of enactment of this  law.  Section 106, acceptance of deposits:  Since branches of foreign banks are not  members of the Federal Deposit Insur ance Corporation, they are not permitted  to accept deposits of U.S. citizens or busi nesses without maintaining with  the  FDIC a  surety deposit or bond in an  amount determined by the Federal Re serve Board as sufficient to protect de positors and creditors of the branch.  Section 107, authority of Federal Re serve System: The Federal Reserve Board  is  granted  the  authority  to make  branches and agencies of foreign banks  subject to reserve requirements, interest  rate controls, and reporting requirements  which are imposed on Federal Reserve  member banks. The Federal Reserve is  also granted the authority to draft rules  and  regulations permitting  access  of  branches and agencies of foreign banks  to the clearing, discount, and  advance  facilities of the Federal Reserve System.  Section  108,  nonbanking  activities:  This section makes the provisions of the  Bank Holding Company Act of 1956-as  amended-applicable  to  each  foreign  bank which has a branch, agency or sub sidiary in the United States. The non banking activities engaged in as of De cember 3, 1974-the date of introduction  of the original Federal Reserve foreign  banking legislation-must be terminated  by December 31, 1985. A foreign bank or  subsidiary which  is underwriting, dis tributing,  or  selling  securities  in  the  United  States may  continue  in  the  write securities in the United States, but  many not sell or distribute securities in  the United States except to the extent al lowed national banks.  Section 109, guidelines for entry: Re quires that the Secretary of the Treasury  establish guidelines for the entry of for eign banking organizations and individ uals into banking in the United States.  The Secretary would have the authority  to disapprove applications  for  foreign  branches, or acquisitions of domestic  banks by foreign banks, either at the Fed eral or the State level, if the Secretary  finds that approval would be contrary t.o  the guidelines established under this sec tion.  Section 110, representative offices: Re quires that representative offices of for eign banks be registered with the Sec retary of the Treasury.  Section 111, cease-and-desist orders:  Allows bank  regulatory authorities  issue cease-and-desist orders in the same  manner in which they apply to an in sured bank.  Mr. Speaker, this bill differs from the  original Federal Reserve Board legisla tive proposals of 1974 and 1975  in the  areas which follow:  t.o  BRANCHING ACROSS STATE LINES AND  ""GRANDFATHERING''  The Feders.l Reserve bill would per mit any foreign bank to open a branch  in any State without regard  to State  law. Our bill would permit a foreign bank  to establish a branch outside its home  State only with the approval of the reguSEc. 101. (a) This title may be cited as the  ""International Banking Act of 1976"".  ( b) For the purposes of this Act( 1) ""agency"" means any office or any place  of business of a foreign bank located in any  State of the United States at which credit  balances are maintained  incidental  to or  arising out of  the exercise of commercial  banking powers and checks are paid or money  is lent but at which deposits may not by law  be accepted from citizens or residents of the  United States.  (2) ""Board"" means the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System.  (3) ""branch"" means any omce or any place  of business of a foreign bank located in any  State of the United States at which deposits  are received and checks are paid or money  is lent.

116,,94,-0.303,374,9,Mr. DELANEY.," Mr.  Speaker,  this  Thursday marks the sacred celebration  of the Passover for the Jewish people and  this weekend the solemn commemoration  of death and renewed life for their f el l ow countrymen who are Christians. It  is only fitting that on Monday next we  call to mind those early dawn hours of  April 19, 1943, when the Jewish Combat  Organization ZOB, commanded by Mor decai Anzelewicz, began its armed upris ing against Nazi troops in the ghetto of  Warsaw.  It was on September 1, 1939, that the  Second World War began with the Nazi  Blitzkrieg against Poland. On Septem ber 17, the Soviet Union announced that  the Polish State with which it had re cently signed a nonaggression pact no  longer existed and crossed  the Polish  frontier from the east. Although War saw held out defiantly until Septem ber 27, by October 5 combined Commu nist and Nazi forces had conquered Po land. The Nazis decided on November 15,  1940, to seal off the entire Jewish popu lation of the capital and completely seg regated them from the rest of the city.  They forced nearly one-third of War saw's population into an enclosed ghetto.  The invaders soon tired of their cam paign of segregation and starvation and  in the summer of 1942 decided to use  more drastic measures. From July 22  through September 21  they undertook  the first phase of a systematic extermina tion of all Jews in Poland and liquida tion of the Warsaw ghetto. More than  300,0-00 people were either deported or  shot.  It was at 2: 15 a.m. on April 19, 1943,  that the Warsaw ghetto was ringed by a.  cordon of SS  troopers. They actually  gave as an excuse the fact that only 200  Jews had BJlSWered a call for workers to  be sent to the Trawnlki concentration  camp after a higher quota had been set.  After 12 hours of bitter fighting, the Nazi  attackers were forced to withdraw tem porarily. Not a single Nazi remained alive  in the ghetto area. The courageous stand  of the Jewish population against the for eign aggressor continued until May 16,  organized resistance giving way to guer illa warfare. Finally, in a symbolic and  almost ceremonial act, the Nazis dyna the great synagogue. Over 800  acres were utterly devastated-SS Gen.  Juergen Stroop reported:  mited  The former Jewish quarter of Warsaw is no  longer in ex.istence.  Mr. Speaker, this 33d anniversary of  the Warsaw ghetto uprising reminds us  of the sacrifices made by 6 million Euro pean Jews and an equal number of other  Europeans who died in the holocaust of  World War II. It reminds us of the cour age, patience, and perseverance of a peo ple who had borne persecution, suffering,  and separation from their homeland for  nearly 2,000 years-of their spirit which  still inspires every man and woman who  loves freedom and hates tyranny and op pression. But, above, all, it reminds us of  man's capacity for inhumanity to his fel low man.  Mr. Speaker,  as George Santayana  noted so well, those who cannot remem ber the past are condemned to repeat it.  Let us never forget.

117,,94,-0.464,374,9,Mr. KOCH.," Mr. Speaker, I believe the  letter which follows  tells of the repres sive situation in Uruguay better than any  statistic can. Mr. Selmar Balbi, a trade  union leader and teacher, wrote to Presi dent Bordaberry concerning the death  of his son, Alvaro Balbi, at the hands of  the military. The letter which  follows  was  provided me by Amnesty  Inter national:  MONTEVIDEO,  August 6, 1975.  To his excellence the President of the Repub lic of Uruguay, DON JUAN MARIA BORDA BERRY.  Ma. PRESIDENT:  I am writing to you the  most difficult letter of my life, and because  it involves pressing matters of moral reason  a.nd conscience, I shall be coldly precise in  my appeal for justice.  I am writing to you as President of the  Republic, and with regard for your dectsion making powers, as Supreme Commander of  the Armed Forces.  I do not seek condolences, for I need no  words of consolation. Every day I  a.m over whelmed with the sympathy of a whole peo ple. Believe me,  there ls no element of ex aggeration in this. Ask your own children.  As Head of State, Mr. President, only you  can reply to me by action, and the action re quired in this dreadful instance-which un fortunately is not unique in our country should be a  just, exemplary, definitive and  public punishment, duly documented and  published, as is often done through all the  public media.  Mr. President, my plea springs not from any  mean spirit of revenge, but solely from a  longing to secure for the ordinary citizens of  the Republic  the guarantee  that  random  murder will not go unpunished. I ask only  this and in this instance, nothing else. You  hold the scales and can judge as the most  responsible otncer in the country.  On Tuesday, 20 July last, my son Alvaro  Balbi, wa.s arrested by the Combined Forces  {mllita.ry and police--AIJ under your com mand, Mr. President. My son was Uruguayan,  31 years old, married, father of four small  children, and an honest, hardworking man.  All  the  efforts  of his wife, my young  daughter-in-law, to locate him through the  authorities were in vain. Wednesday the 30th  passed.

118,,94,0.169,387,9,Mr. RUPPE.," Mr. Speaker, our col leagues,  and BEN  GILMAN, are presently serving as con gressional delegates to the Law of the  Sea Conference in New York.  They have submitted a rePort on their  observations of the first 4 weeks, which  think is worthy of careful study by all  of us.  I  BACKGROUND PAPER AND PROGRESS REPORT ON  NEW YORK LAW OF THE SEA CONFDENCE,  HALF-WAY POINT, A.Pan. 9, 1976  msTORICAL SETI'ING  Strong maritime powers have traditionally  desired the broadest possible ""freedom of the  seas."" Since  the last century, when naval  guns had a  range of three miles, generally  accepted.  international  law has  recognized  the freedom of the high seas outside a three mlle  ""territorial""  sea  controlled  by  the  coastal nation.  In 1945, however, President Truman pro claimed that the United States owned exclu sive  rights  to  the  rich mineral  resources  on our continental shelves extending well  into  the Atlantic, Pacific, Caribbean, and  Arctic Oceans. Subsequently, certain Latin  American countries, notably Peru, Ecuador,  Chile and Brazil, claimed jurisdictions out to  200 miles, 1n order to protect their tuna and  shrimp resources.  10591  In 1968,  the United States enacted  the  Fisherman's Protective Act (PL 90--482), and  agreed to compensate tuna companies whose  vessels were seized  inside foreign 200-mile  zones. In 1972, the State Department nego tiated an  agreement with Brazil,  subse quently ratified by Congress,  in which we  agreed that Brazil could regulate U.S. shrimp  fishermen within 200 miles of her coastline  and further, that we would contribute to the  cost of such regulation.  In 1974, the UN's International Court of  Justice ruled that Iceland had no right to  unilaterally declare a 50 mile fishery protec tion zone. That decision led to the famous  ""cod war"" between British trawlers and Ice land's small navy, unresolved  to  this day.  International efforts to remedy these prob lems commenced in 1958 with the first UN  Law of the Sea Conference. Four treaties re sulted which were  ratified. by  the United  States, Convention on The High Seas  ( 55  other nations as signatories), The Continen tal Shelf (53 other nations), The Territona.i  Sea and. Contiguous Zone (43 other nations),  and Fishing and. Conservation of the Living  Resources of the High Seas  (33 other na tions).  A second LOS Conference convened in 1960  but adjourned in failure.  Plans for the third LOS Conference origi nated in 1970 with a unique and historical  U.S. policy decision to espouse the principle  that the mineral resources of the deep sea bed should be considered ""the common heri tage of mankind,"" to be shared with develop ing nations, rather than exploited solely by  those with the technological means to do so  (then and now, primarily the United States,  which, by 1976, has several major companies  ready and able to proceed).  The Third LOS conference, with 143 na tions participating, met  for  10 weeks  in  Caracas in 1974, 7 weeks in Geneva in 1975,  and is meeting in New York from March 15  through May 7, with  time  reserved  for a  fourth and final session, either 1n New York  or Geneva, later this summer.  Since the Conference's inception, the im portance of agreement has been further em the Mayaguez 7 Y2  phasized by seizure of  miles off the Cambodlan coast 1n 1975.  IMPORTANCE OF THE CURRENT SESSION  The current session is admittedly at the  ""make-or-break"" stage of the negotiations.  If a nearly-complete revised single negotiat ing text cannot achieve consensus by May 7,  it is fairly well conceded by most participants  that the negotiations could break down com pletely as they did in 1960, with nations ta.k ing unilateral action to protect their own  national interests as Congress did 1n enact ing our 200 mile fisheries protection bill last  week.  The Senate Commerce Committee (by voice  vote), and  the House Oceanographic Sub committee (by a vot.e of 16 to 1), have both  reported out b1lls to encourage deep seabed  mining, bills which 1f enacted into law, would  clearly end any treaty incentive on the part  of a. majority of  the nations participating  in the third LOS Conference.  Politically,  the American  people would  probably strongly approve passage of  this  legislation, should the New York session end  on May 7th at an impasse. Deep Seabed Min ing would not constitute a violation of exist ing  international  law or  treaties  as was  argued in the case of the 200 mile blll, so  presumably the Congress will be as quick to  move on the deep seabed mining legislation  as it was the 200 mile bill 1! the New York  session ls unable to come close to consensus  on a treaty by May 7.

120,Senate,94,0.499,452,9,Mr. BUCKLEY.," Mr. President, today,  on behalf of  the distiguished Senator  from Nevada (Mr. LAxALT) and myself,  I am introducing a bill which would re move a major inequity from the Federal  income tax. Today, renters are denied  an  income  tax deduction for property  taxes which homeowners have enjoyed  for years. My bill would reform Federal  tax law to allow renters to deduct from  their taxable income the amount of their  rent that reflects tax payments to State  and local governments.  This inequity has cost renters over $600  million per year.  Property owners, under section 164 of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, have  been able  to deduct amounts equal to  the property taxes which they incur. A  landlord collects, as rented income, an  amount sufficient  to cover such  taxes.  Thus the deductibility of the property  tax nicely offsets the additional rent he  has to charge.  The renter, however,  is  required,  in  effect, to bear the burden of local prop erty taxes without receiving a compar able deduction. There can be no doubt  that a portion of his rent represents  amounts to be paid by the landlord to the  local  taxing authority. Yet the  tenant  must continue to pay Federal taxes on  income used to pay local property taxes,  because he is unable to take a deduction  for those portions of his rent which are  applied to State and local taxes.  Out of a tenant's monthly rental pay ment as much as 25 percent may repre sent money which is received, not for  the benefit of the landlord, but to pay  the State or locality in the form of real  property tax. Although the landlord acts,  in effect, as the agent of the tenant for  the payment of  the  tax,  that entire  amount  is  imputed as  income  to  the  landlord. Hence the landlord's deduction  is completely consumed in order to off set the artificial  income which  is at tributed to him. The result is that rental  property  is effectively denied a Stat.e  and local property tax deduction.  The bill which I am introducing would  alleviate the discrimination which cur rently  exists by granting a  renter a  deduction for property taxes which are  effectively paid by him. The  landlord  would notify the tenant in the lease of  the amount of property taxes attributa ble to the tenant. At the end of the year,  the tenant would be able to take that  amount as a deduction from his adjusted  gross income.  The one point which I would empha size  is that the landlord's tax liability  would  remain  unchanged  under my  proposal. He would not receive the bene fit of the tax deduction, but he would no  longer be required to impute income for  money passed on to State and local tax ing authorities. The sole result will be  the more equitable treatment of tenants  and, therefore, a fairer operation of the  Internal Revenue Code.  By Mr. PEARSON:  S. 3308.

123,Senate,94,-0.204,504,9,Mr. SPARKMAN.," Mr. President,  a  short while back Amtrak announced that  it would  improve  the Chicago-Florida  rail passenger route known as the Florid ian which now operates through Louis ville, Nashville, Decatur, Birmingham,  Montgomery, and across south Georgia  to Jacksonville. The Amtrak announce ment stated that stations along the route  would be modernized and refurbished to  give added attraction to this important  rail link.  Now it is reported that Amtrak, faced  with  substantial budget  cuts  recom mended by the administration, is threat ening to reverse  itself and discontinue  the Floridian.  This route ought to be a busy and im portant link in our system of passenger  transportation. It is a link between the  populous Great Lakes  region and one  of the fastest growing areas of the Na tion-Florida and the Southeastern Gulf  States.  This line is the only Amtrak service  which touches Alabama, and I urge its  continuance for that reason. But it is  important regardless of that fact, and  I shall continue to urge that the Florid ian operate-and on improved schedules.  In this connection, let me add that it  is ironic that the Nation which led the  world in creating the most extensive rail  passenger service anywhere, the Nation  which pioneered in engine and car de sign, and built magnificent rail passenger  stations all across the land, is now the  scene of second-or third-class rail pas senger service.  I feel that the service ought to be ex tended and improved, so that rail pas senger  travel again  is enjoyed by the  traveling public. Rail service could save  us  when  the economy cries out for new  stimuli, a nationwide effort to improve  in energy. In a  tremendously  rail passenger service--roadbeds, rolling  stock, engines, and the rest--would fur nish such a stimulus.  I would like to see Amtrak service from  time  New Orleans  to  Jacksonville,  ample. I have advocated restoration of  such a route, by way of Mobile and Pen sacola, for a good while. an effort  in  for ex which the Senators from Florida, Louis iana, and Mississippi have joined. Such a  route would connect with rail lines to  every part of the United States.  So I protest any eft'ort to reduce or do  a way with the Floridian and its service and urge instead serious study of ways to  make rail passenger service fast, safe.  and attractive to Americans.

125,Senate,94,-0.443,543,9,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  the  conference report on the 1975 Federal Aid Highway Act is the product of long  and arduous work on the Senate con ferees who should be commended for  their efforts.  As Senator BENTSEN noted when we  first debated the bill last year, it is an  interim measure, designed to allow the  highway program to continue while we  once again reexamine our Nation's trans portation policy. It is my hope that we  will be able to resolve the many diffi.cult  policy questions we face and revise our  Nation's  transportation policy  in  the  next Congress to better refiect our na tional transportation needs.  I am pleased the conferees accepted  the basic provisions of my amendment  dealing with  the  interstate  transfer  section.

126,House,94,-0.339,556,9,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Chairman, as a mem ber of the House Select Committee on  Aging I rise in full support of the amend ment sponsored by our chairman to in crease funds for the title m and IV pro gram of the Older Americans Act. AP. a  cosponsor of  the amendment of 1973  and 1975 to the act, I feel failure to adopt  this amendment  today will effectively  hinder the act's ability to meet the needs  of this Nation's elderly.  Since the implementation of the act 1n  1965, there has been a constant struggle  to obtain reasonable funding levels for  its various sections. We have been suc cessful with those sections which have  been funded  including  the highly acclaimed title VII nutrition program. Yet  with others, the intent of Congress has  never been fully realized.  This amendment today deals with title  III and IV of the Older Americans Act.  All  told  the amendment  is seeking a  modest $14.2 million  increase for  title  III which encompasses a number of im portant programs  including State ad ministration and area planning and so cial  services.  In  this  latter  category  among the services provided are impcr tant in home services including health  care and legal services. In the past 2  years almost 1 million senior citizens  have been added to the eligibility list for  services under title m, yet the recom mended increase proposed by the admin istration would in no way be adequate to  meet these new demands.  I would also like to focus brief atten tion on one of the programs contained  under title IV of the act, namely part C  which would establish multidisciplinary  centers for the aging. This program was  established as part of the 1973 amend ments but as of this date has never been  funded. I know in my own congressional  district  there has been great  interest  registered by groups seeking to establish  such a center. The potential benefits of  these centers would be numerous for the  elderly population. The supplemental bill  contains no funds for  title IV C. The  Aging Committee proposal wc:>uld provide  $2 million through the transitional quar ter  to establish sample demonstration  programs in this area.  Mr. Chairman,  the Older Americans  Act was considered landmark legislation  for the senior citizens of this Nation. Yet  today it is more dream than reality due  to consistent funding inadequacies. Our  elderly population is in greater need of  the services under the Olde-r Americans  Act than they were when the act was  first passed. It is foolish for us to pass  laws if the intent is never going to be  realized. I urge the support of all Mem bers  to  this  reasonable and humane  amendment. Let us  allow  the Older  Americans Act to fulfill its promises. An  affirmative vote today will be an impor tant first step.  ",1976
127,House,94,-0.281,556,9,Mr. SLACK.," Mr. Chairman, chapter IX  concerns itself with appropriation items  for the Departments of State and Com merce,  the Judiciary, and four related  agencies. The totals for chapter IX are  as follows:  Budget  estimate  Recommended  in blll  Fiscal year 1976---------------------------Transition period-------------------------Liquidation of contract auth--------------$13,274,000  31, 964, 000  30, 235, 000  $11,872,000  6,893,000  Comparlson  -$1, 402, 000  -26, 071, 000  -30, 235, 000  to  Pursuant to the U.S.-U.S.S.R. agree ment concerning sale of grain  the  Soviet Union, concluded on December 29,  1975, one-third of the grain purchased  is  to be transported in U.S.-fiag ships.  The Department of Commerce indicated  that subsidy payments required during  fiscal year 1976 and the transition p.e riod for such shipments can be made  within funds presently available.  With  regard  to  the Department of  State, under ""Contributions to Interna tional Organizations,""  the  committee  recommends an additional appropriation  of $3,188,000 for payment to the World  Health Organization, for 1976 calendar  year. This amount is within the 25 per cent  limitation. The  request  included  $25,902,000  to  pay  the  International  Labor Organization the balance of the  assessment for calendar years 1975 and  1976. Since the United States has filed  notification of intent to withdraw from  the  International Labor Organization,  the request is not recommended at the  present time.  With  respect  to  the Renegotiation  Board,  the  committee  considered  re quests for additional appropriations of  $115,000 for fiscal year 1976 and $162,000 for the transition period. SLT1.ce legis lation <H.R. 10680) affecting the organi zation and operation of the Board has  passed the House and is pending in the  Senate, it seems inappropriate to expand  the Board staff at the present time. Con sequently, the requests have been denied.  The various  items are set forth  in  some detail on pages 72  through 79 of  the committee report.  ",1976
128,House,94,0.189,556,9,Mr. SKUBITZ.," Mr. Chairman, I want  to commend the committee for providing  the additional funds-for a number of  worthy programs for the aging.  The fastest growing segment of our  population  is  the elderly-and  I  can  think of no more beneficial way to use  funds to increase and improve the social  services for our senior citizens.  In my own district of Kansas funds  provided through the older American's  programs have help.ed institute a num ber of vitally needed and well-received  services.  I would like to briefly tell you about  two of  those programs, both of which  will be  affected by  this  supplemental  appropriation. Under the title m pro gram, several southeast Kansas counties  have developed transportation programs  for the elderly, which include rural bus  routes.  Over 5,000  elderly citizens of small  towns and rural areas are transported  into the cities by this program for medi cal care, shopping, and social gatherings  they could not attend otherwise.  Clarence Balley, of Altamount, Kans.,  who uses a wheelchair and a walker to  get around wrote a letter about this serv ice and explained how being able to use  the rural bus has helped him, he says:  started. When I was living in Chetopa at the  hotel, Doris Ekhoff came and told me about  it. Then when I fell and had to come to the  rest home I can still get out once or twice a  month and ride.

Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise in  support of the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Missouri, my colleague  and chairman of the Select Committee  on Aging,  the distinguished gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. RANDALL) .  The basic points of  the amendment  have already been outlined by the gentle man from Missouri. I will simply say that  the programs covered by  the amend ments, titles III, IV, and V of the Older  Americans Act, are within the area of  responsibility of the subcommittee I chair  on Federal, State, and community serv ices.  The State and area offices on aging  funded under  title III constitute  the  ""aging network"" about which so many  people speak these days.  We have had an increase of almost  20 percent over the last 2 years in the  number of area agencies on aging. Con gress significantly expanded the respon sibilities of these agencies only months  ago, with  the enactment of the Older  Americans Act Amendments of 1975. The  authorization for title m, by the way,  was increased in that act from $130 mil lion in fiscal year 1975 to $180 million in  fiscal year 1976-an increase of almost  40 percent.  Model projects were also broadened in  scope; the number of priority areas des ignated by Congress was increased from  four to seven.  As for title IV, there is no way to sta:tf  the growing number of agencies reaching  the elderly except by training adequate  numbers of persons to serve in the field.  That, and the carrying out of important  research into the problems of America's  elderly,  the  thrust of  title IV. Our  amendment would simply  restore  this  title to its 1974 funding level.  I will address myself to the need for  adequate appropriations under title V for  senior centers, when I offer an amend ment to the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Missouri.  Mr. Chairman, I have often said that  the greatness of a society-indeed, per haps even its capacity for survival--de pends on how sensitive it is to the needs  of its elderly citizens.  We  in  the House have a  chance to  demonstrate  that sensitivity  today, by  supporting  the pending amendment.  urge its overwhelming approval.  ",1976

The effect of this bill would be to con tinue  the  temporary Federal  supple mental benefits  to areas of continuing  high unemployment within a State, even  when the State as a whole is no longer  eligible for such benefits because of a  lower unemployment rate. On April 3,  Federal  supplemental beneftts-FSB were cut off to Ohio and 12 other States  whose  overall  insured  unemployment  rates had fallen below 5 percent. Yet  there remain in Ohio-and many of the  other  12 States-large  labor market  areas with extremely high unemploy ment.

Jobs  in Akron are  harder to find than ever, and the sudden  loss of Federal  supplemental benefits  will leave many jobless workers with no  income at all, since most of them are not  eligible for AFDC or SSI payments.  Although unlimited extension of the  FSB program is probably not the best  answer  to assisting  jobless workers  in  times of high employment, the situation  facing us is an emergency one. Until a  better program can be worked out, some  immediate action is essential to protect  those workers who will be left with vir tually no assistance and no opportunity  for employment. The bill which I  am  pleased  to  join  in cosponsoring  today  LEN)  with my colleague from Ohio CMr. WHA is one approach  to solving  this  problem.

CAPITOL HILL FORUM OBSERVES  FIRST ANNIVERSARY  HON. HELEN S. MEYNER  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 13, 1976  ",1976
145,,94,-0.411,647,9,Mrs. MEYNER.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  take  this occasion to congratulate  the  Capitol Hill Forum on its flrst anniver sary. This newspaper has a special sig nificance in that it is the first publication  for the Capitol Hill community devoted  to a serious and substantive discussion  of important issues.  From time to time the scores of trade  and association journals published and  circulated in Washington touch upon an  issue of significance to their respective  pressure group,  union,  association or  cause.  The Capitol Hill Forum is a refreshing experiment, however, with regular  commentaries and analyses on contem poraneous matters. In the past several  months, for  instance, it has published  outstanding, in-depth articles on the new  congressional budget  process, Federal  ",1976
146,,94,-0.439,673,9,Mr. JOHNSON of California.," Mr.  Speaker, too often we in our society take  for granted those fine men and women  who serve in our law enforcement agen cies. We do not think about a Police om cer until we need him.  When one such dedicated omcer enters  a well-justified retirement, we do realize  how much he, as an individual and in  the profession which he has followed, has  given to his community. One such law  enforcement omcer is Fay E. Bates, under  sheriff of Placer County where I have  lived my entire life.  Fay Bates  joined  the Placer County  Sheriff's Department as a deputy in 1951.  Due to a variety of reasons he was called  upon early to accept additional responsi bilities. He handled them so well that in  1952 he was apPointed under sheriff. At  that time there were only nine men on  the sheriff's force covering a large geo graphic area ext.ending from  the high  mountains of Lake Tahoe to the Sacra mento Valley, an area of more than 1,500  square miles.  As under sheriff Fay Bates continued  his efforts t;o improve not only the de partment but his own personal skills as a  law enforcement officer. He is a graduate  of one of the :first Peace omcers Stand ards and Training courses. He holds an  advanced certificate of achievement pre sented by the State of California Peace  Officers Standards and Training Pro gram. He has taught several classes in  law enforcement at Sierra College. These  have met with great success and have  been praised by both the faculty of the  college  and  law  enforcement  omcers  throughout northern California..  Professionally,  Bates  has  directed  many of the criminal investigations and  to overseeing the adm1n1strative matters  related to the sheriff's department.  search and rescue operations, In addition  108771  He has contributed many, many years  to the youth programs and other civic  projects in Auburn.  My old friend, Sheriff Bill Scott, with  whom Fay Bates has worked for many,  many years, swnmed up his feelings when  he told me:  It probably sounds corny, but I feel I am  losing my right arm. Fay w1ll be cllffi.cult to  replace.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I want to  take this OPPortunity to commend Fay  Bates for an outstanding career of public  service and to wish him happiness and  success in the retirement years ahead.  AID TO NEW YORK CITY  HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY  OF IOWA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 13, 1976  ",1976
147,,94,0.342,673,9,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. Speaker, from the  beginning I have opposed Federal aid to  New York City. Taxpayers from through out the country should not have to suffer  from the mistakes made by this eastern  metropolis. Although city omcials say  they have reduced spending in New York,  the fact is that they are still living high  on the hog.  The commentary by George Will  yesterday's Washington Post gives us an  idea of just how much cutting back New  York still has left to do. I would like to  insert it in the record for my colleagues  to consider when we debate New York  City aid again:  in  THE R.EcKLESS LIFE OF NEW YORK ClTY  (By George F. Will)  Treasury Secretary William Simon, who  must hold some kind of record for hours de voted  to congressional  testimony,  testi:fles  with a  forebeara.nce you would not expect  from  a man with no prior experience at  teaching remedial arithmetic to recalcitrant  pupils.  Recently he  led  some  senators  through  addition and subtraction exercises, and then  expressed, drolly, ""cautious optimism"" about  New York City's short-term future.  In a  masterpiece of poker-faced  testimony, Si mon did not laugh even once when telling  the senators that the city only needs a will  to cut spending.""  Put plainly, Simon's evidence is that the  city wlll become America's largest slum un less  it  takes politically arduous decisions  regarding such hitherto sacrosanct matters  as  rent  control  and  public  employee  perquisites.  Rent control 1s  a middle-class  subsidy;  most poor people have arrived in New York  too recently, or move too frequently, to bene fit from it. It depresses rents in a period of  rising costs,  thereby encouraging abandon ment of 30,000 rental units a year. It de presses the real estate tax base, thereby forc ing  the city  to  rely on  taxes  that cause  individuals and businesses  to  flee  to  the  green Connecticut countryside. It also pro duces tax avoidance: By January, $1 billion  1n real es~te. water and sewer taxes were  uncollected.  The city council recently received the re port o! a blue-ribbon commission critical of  rent control. Then the council, remembering  that there are more tenants than landlords,  extended rent control untll the end of the  decade.  ",1976
148,,94,0.612,686,9,Mr. ASHBROOK.," Mr. Speaker, in 1972  Congress created the Consumer Product  Safety Commission. Despite its relatively  short life span, the CPSC has already  managed to surpass many other Federal  agencies  in its ability  to make absurd  decisions and intrude into matters better  left untouched.  The latest misadventure is in the area  of paper matches. According to an edi torial in the April 6 Washington Star,  the CPSC has decided that major re forms are needed in the construction of  paper matches. These reforms  include  requiring that the matches be packaged  in hard-to-open folders and that they  be  treated chemically  to make  them  self-extinguishing.  As the Star editorial queries:  Why in the name of locofocos ls the Federal  Government  fiddling  around with  book  matches? In any reasonable perspective  is  this a justifiable excursion by government?  Such ridiculous activities may make  Federal bureaucrats happy, but they are  of little benefit to the businessman or  the public. I heartily agree with the con cluding line of the Star editorial.  Instances like this one generate the grow ing apprehension that not a sparrow can fall  without a federal bureaucrat fast and fuzzily  being on the case.  Following is the complete text of the  editorial:  April 13, 1976  CONSUMER PRODUCT ABSUlU>rrY  The persistent hoopla from the political  stumps castigating the muscular, or muscle bound, operations of big government is caus ing concern among those who believe that a  strong  federal  role  is  indispensable. The  rhetoric condemning the federal establish ment's regulatory function, this thesis goes,  could lead to repudiation of past and bene ficial correctives.  The bipartisan declamations against intru siv.e government are fueled by bureaucratic  inanl ty and arrogance that stun even those  who support the regulatory principle. Wit ness the Consumer Product Safety Commis sion's foray against bookmatches. The com mission has done a few helpful chores in its  three years of existence, providing as much  as anything, an educative public voice. But  a  tendency to over-reach not infrequently  holds the agency up to an eroding ridicule.  The  commission  thinks  paper-match  standards need reforming. It has moved to ward requiring that bookmatches be pack aged in hard-to-open folders, and that the  matches be treated chemically to make them  self-extinguishing. A spokesman for the rela tively small match industry has, so to speak,  fired back, contending the cost of meeting  the standards could mean the end of the  cheap and handy commodity. That may be a  mite overstated-we don't know.  But why in the name of locofocos is the  federal  government  fiddling  around with  bookmatches? In any reasonable perspective  is this a justltlable excursion by government?  The rationale for the safety commission's  gallop ls that 9,500 persons last year required  hospital  treatment as a  result of  injuries  related  to matches. Horrendous-by hasty  figuring that comes out to less than half of  one-hundredth of 1 per cent of a popula tion of 215 million. Talk about a clear and  present danger. The news report we saw 1S  not more  specltlc,  though  the Consumer  Product Safety Commission undoubtedly pro duced voluminous  studies  to demonstrate  the peril of bookmatches. Children, we imag ine, in some numbers were among the 9,500  casualties.  (How serious were the injuries,  by the way?)  We can almost hear the staff minds at the  commission whlrrlng in vigorous synchron1zatlon---0hildren, matches, reform! At that  point, we'd all have been better off if the  staff and the commissioner had taken quite  a long lunch. Of course, matches are danger ous in the hands of children. Of course, fire  fascinates the young. Is this to be eliminated  by dictating that an entire industry retool  to provide an allegedly childproof match book and a  self-extinguishing match? You  can bet a tllck of your Blc it will not.  Instances like this one generate the grow ing apprehension that not a sparrow can fall  without a federal bureaucrat fast and fuzzily  being on the case.

151,Senate,94,-0.319,738,9,Mr. SYMINGTON.," Mr. President, for  some years I have been presenting to the  Senate the greatest security proolem this  country and the world face today-the  steady increase in the number of nations  capable of building nuclear weapons.  Others are also bringing attention to  that danger. The distinguished senior  Senator from Connecticut, Senator RIB ICOFF, wrote an interesting and construc tive article which appeared in the New  York Times on March 26.  I ask unanimous consent that this ar ticle, ""Trading in Doom,"" be included in  the RECORD at the conclusion of  these  remarks.  ",1976
152,Senate,94,-0.262,751,9,Mr. GLENN.," Mr. President, today I rise  to introduce S. 3319,  the School Inte gration Innovation Act of 1976.  s. 3319 extends the Emergency School  Aid  Assistance  Act--ESAA-through  August 31, 1978, at an authorized fund ing level of $1 billion per year. The bill  also amends the ESAA by clarifying and  adding to the activities for which ESAA  funds can be used by communities im plementing both court ordered and vol untary desegregation plans. Specifically,  S. 3319 would provide for funds to sup port:  First. The construction and/ or opera tion of ""magnet"" schools;  Second. The pairing of schools and  programs with specific colleges and uni versities and with leading businesses;  Third. The construction and develop ment of education parks and neutral site  schools;  Fourth. Education programs especially  designed to improve the quality of edu cation in inner city schools.  My bill provides that nothing in this  act shall be construed in a manner that  is  inconsistent with  the  full enforce ment of the 5th and 14th amendments  to the Constitution and of title VI of the  Civil Rights Act of 1764.  Mr. President, I introduce this legisla tion with a sense of urgency because I  would  like to provide a positive direc tion and some practical solutions in the  overheated area of school desegregation.  Debate on this issue has now deteriorated  to irrationality and emotionalism when  the discussion should be on how best to  provide a good education for all students  and at the same time desegregate our  schools under  the  law. Basically our  thrust should be-and this is the centraJ  purpose of S. 3319-to design and develop  schools  that will be  so  attractive  to  whites, blacks, and other racial groups  that school integration will occur natur ally rather than through the mandatory  busing of schoolchildren. While that ob jective will be diffi.cult to achieve-and  perhaps impossible to achieve totally it is worth striving for to the maximum  extent possible.  My home State of Ohio now has pend ing seven major school desegregation  lawsuits and roughly 30 additional de segregation  investigations. The  seven  lawsuits  involve over 400,000 students.  Soon,  it  is  likely  that communities  in  Ohio will be faced with the implemen tation of desegregation plans. Emergen cy school aid assistance money will be  needed by those communities to pay for  educational programs  related  those plans. My bill would provide that  assistance.  Mr. President, rhetoric on the deseg regation  issue has grown most shrill  new  to  ",1976
153,Senate,94,0.195,803,9,Mr. BEALL.," Mr. President, the Balti more Sunday Sun, on February 16, 1976,  featured an article,  entitled,  ""Three Pronged Attack on Sickness,'' by Gerri  Kobren. This is an excellent article de scribing  a  successful program  in my  State, a program which rightfully has  attracted considerable national attention  and support and a program which de serves to be emulated elsewhere.  This program involves the participa tion of three institutions-the Franklin  Square Hospital, the Baltimore County  Eastern Regional Health Center, and the  Essex Community College--all of which  are  located  on  the  Essex  campus.  Through this joint venture and effort,  they have been able to achieve consider ably more than acting alone. In recogni tion of the out.standing effort, a number  of foundations, including the W. K. Kel logg Foundation and the Robert Wood  Johnson Foundation, have awarded this  consortium significant grants.  On August 19 of last year, I had the  pleasure of visiting these facilities. I was  impressed  then,  and  I  believe  even  stronger now, that the efforts underway  there make a great deal of sense and will  be extremely beneficial to the citizens of  Baltimore County.  Mr. President, so that the rest of the  country might be aware of the pot.ential  of such cooperative efforts, I ask unani mous consent that the Baltimore Sun  article be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  as follows:  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  THREE-PRONGED ATTACK ON SICKNESS  (By Gerri Kobren)  There  isn't anything  particularly  new  about women's cancer screening cllnlcs, or  about offers of free hypertension and gonor rhea  testing. What  ls exciting about  the  program beginning February 23 at Baltimore  country's Eastern Regional Health Center  on Franklin Square drive-and continuing  every Monday morning and Tuesday after noon through April 27-ls not what's going  on, but who ls doing it.  With students in the allied health career  programs at Essex Community College do ing the actual examinations and tests and  patients with abnormal findings being refer red to physicians at Franklin Squa~e Hospi tal, this attempt to provide primary-medical  care to the community ls being coordinated,  publicized and budgeted by the 2¥2-year-old  Health and Education Councll, with funds  filtered from th~ '""ederal government through  the state and county.  This ls the kind of thing for which the  council was created  ln 1973 by  the  three  participating lnstltutlons: the hospital, the  college and the county health department.  David Sapadin, director of HEC admits such  consortlums aren't new in the health field,  this one, he claims,  ls unusual because it  integrates the staff, fac111tles and programs  of three separate institutions which share a  campus, its board of directors includes the  two top executives of each of the partici pating units, and the thrust 1s multlphaslc.  Health care delivery ls only part of lt. Coun cil efforts are directed at career, consumer  and continuing education as well.  GREW FROM  INFORMAL LL\ISON  The Health and Education Council grew  out of a less formal liaison between hospital,  college and health depa~ment in the talk ing stage since the late Fifties. The two-year  college, operating from scattered rooms and  trailers, but planning a building complex in  this pa.rt of eastern Baltimore country, ap proached the hospital with the suggestion of  a cooperative venture; hospital and school  brought the health department  into lt.  ""Everyone said it couldn't be done,""  re calls Sanford Kotzen, executive director of  the hospital.  Yet according to Dr. Vernon Wanty, presi dent of the college, this integration of pub lic and private resources ls entirely logical:  ""We have a common goal-to serve the pub llc.""  And apparently it has been working. Essex  provides career oriented curricula in a var iety of medical subjects, graduating nurses,  physicians'  assistants,  dental  hygienists,  mental health assolcates, laboratory, X-ray  and nuclear medicine technicians with the  kind of clinical experiences an isolated com munity college could not provide. The chiefs  of every medical service represented in the  hospital also serve on the school's faculty.  Franklin Square, an easy walk from  the  school's buildings, benefits  from  the  labor of the students, who work in the hos pital on  an  education  ""practicum,""  and  form the pool of new graduates in medical  back-up professions. The school's physical  facmttes--lts auditoriums, classrooms, au dio-visual equipment and extensive  food servlce capablllty are also available to the  hospital which saves an enormous amount of  money by not having to pay for its own.  Moreover, while  the Essex students are  rotating through the hospital, hospital resi dents are gaining community experience In  the cllnlcs at the nearby health department.  The health department, 1n  turn, has  the  services of the young doctors and the Essex  students and can call on  the established.  physicians at the hospital and the instruc free  t.ors at the college when outside expertise ls  needed.  has  With the council coordinating and inte grating the services, programs and projects,  the three lnstltutlons hope to do all these  things more efficiently, cutting out duplica tion and mounting quick responses to the  needs of this particular area, which has the  fastest  growing  population  in Baltimore  county along with one of the lowest phy sician-patient ratios in the state.  The  esta.bllshment  of  the  council  brought another benefit to its constituent  organizations: money. Each of the three con tributes  to HEC's support, providing  the  kind of permanent,  reliable ""seed money""  that attracts outside financing. There has  been a large financial return to the three on  a  relatively small investment by each, said  Dr. Donald Roop, director of  the Eastern  Health Center.  The most  recent, and  the  largest,  ls  a  three-year grant of $401,154 awarded by the  W. K. Kellogg Foundation, of Battle Creek,  Mich., for the development of programs of  continuing education for health workers at  all  levels. This grant would not have been  made to any of the institutions alone, Mr.  Kotzen said. Staff ls being recruited; courses  will be offered, by and for doctors and for  holders  of  the  two-year  associate degree,  starting this summer.  Also geared  to continuing education for  health workers ls a phone-in project devel oped with $14,180 from the American Lung  Association. Using  the college's dial-access  system, registrants can call at any time of  the day or night for a 15-minute taped lec ture on occupational lung disease, 2 a week  for 10 weeks. Those who listen to all 20, in  their own homes and at their own most con venient times, and answer the accompany ing questions wm earn a credit in fulfillment  of continuing education requirements.  FOCUSES ON PRIMARY CARE  Approaching the Kellogg grant in size, but  focusing directly on delivery of primary care,  ls a  three-year grant of $261,503 from  the  Robert Wood Johnson  (of Banda.id fame)  Foundation. This will enable the council to  coordinate care  for patients who use  the  health department clinics. Hospital staffers,  bound by hospital quality control, wm see  them there for diagnosis, and provide conti nuity of care should they have to be hospital ized, avoiding the kind of fragmentation that  occurs when people move from  the public  to the private sector for medical care.  Working in reverse as well, this will pro vide follow-up and supervision for the pa tient who no longer needs in-patient care- the stroke victim, for instance, who might  need speech therapy-in one smooth, con tinuous operation.  In addition, a computerized, joint access  records system will be developed to provide  immediate  information  to workers at  the  hospital or the county clinics for any pa tient who has been treated or received medi cation at either place in the past.  The council  ls  looking at programs of  community education as well, planning to  begin a series for heart patients and their  famlUes,  teaching cardlo-pulmonary resus citation, diet, exercise and stress reduction. It  ls also considering education programs di rected at people who operate restaurants and  nursing homes and must meet health depart ment requirements for licensure.  With all of this there ls both a snowball  and  feedback effect. As physicians attend  professional-level programs  in  the  college  building and interact both professionally and  informally with members of the college com munity, they begin to see the school as an  appropriate education resource. At the same  time,  the general publlc,  also  invited  for  courses and lectures presented by physicians  at the college, begin to look to these institu tions as a. health center for their own com munity.

154,,94,-0.173,855,9,Mr. FUQUA.," Mr. Speaker, never in the  history of this great land have the prob lems seemed more complex and the solu tions to the things that trouble our na tional conscience seemed more elusive.  There is a great yearning on the part of  the American people for a  return to a  day when we seemed to have more drive  and purpose, a simpler time when a man  or woman felt he or she could come to  grips with their individual problems and  wrest out the answer.  That was a time when the major prob lem seeemed to be wresting a living from  the  soil, when our  frontiers  seemed  boundless  and our natural  resources  inexhaustible.  That time is now pa.st as we approach  the 200th birthday of our beloved land.  In just a few short months we will pause  to remember and pay homage to those  who have gone before and particularly  we will remember the tens of thousands  who were denied the privilege of raising  a family and living a normal life because  they were struck down in places like the  Argonne, Iwo Jima, Saipan.  One group that has not forgotten our  heritage and who still believe that we are  one nation blessed by God and who teach  the simple moral virtues that are time less are the Masons, and I take pride in  paying  them  tribute  just prior to  the  convening  of  the Grand  Lodge  of  Florida.  Under  the  leadership  of my  good  friend, William C. Hill, as their grand  master, Florida Masons have not for gotten their heritage nor have they for gotten that with all our manifest bless ings comes a corresponding obligation.  Recently I had an opportunity to be  present with Grand Ma.ster Hill as he  presented a copy of the Declaration of  Independence and a copy of the Amer to Senate Minority Leader  ican Creed  MIKE MANSFIELD.  Bill Hill said something at the time  that I will long remember. He said thatEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Participation means  involvement  .  .  .  involvement means  contact ... contact  means to get out and get the job done ...  that 1s what Masonry is doing.  t.o be  We have a great annual event in our  State called ""Masons for America.""  In other words, this is a group that is  involved,  that is doing something and  they need  recognized for  these  significant contributions as we approach  the Bicentennial.  When Grand Master Hill opens Grand  Lodge, he will call attention to a very  special fiag which I have had :flown over  the U.S. Capitol especially for my Flor ida Grand Lodge. It is a replica of the  Betsy Ross Stars and Stripes, one of our  Nation's first flags. This is a special time  and this is a very special flag. When sig nifying the past, it is a call to the op portunities and challenges we have for  the future.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to say a  few words about my good friend, Bill  Hill, for I believe he typi:fles something  that is good about this country. He is a  successful businessman, but he knows  what it is to work. He is successful be cause he took advantage of the oppor tunities which this land affords and he  has found  time  to give of himself  to  others.  Bill is a native of St. Louis, Mo., born  there on July 8, 1919, missing our Na tion's birthdate by 4 days. He attended  public schools  in Indiana, moving  to  Tampa in 1926. He began as a driver for  Central Truck Lines and then gained a  position with a  firm  titled St. Johns  River Lines, whose business was trans porting by ship. World War II was to  change the direction of a young man's  life, as it did for so many thousands of  others. Calling on his experience, Bill  worked for the omce of Defense Trans portation before entering the U.S. Naval  Construction Battalion  in 1943. From  there it was to Guam where it was service  with the Seabees until the end of the  war.  It was  in 1945  that Bill moved  to  Ocala where he was to work with a meat packing firm, serving as plant manager,  until January of 1951 when he went  back to his :first love-trucking.  With one truck and his lovely wife,  Gladys, serving as office manager and  secretary, Hill's Van Service was begun.  He could not have known at the time  just how successful a young couple will ing to work and who had dreams could  be.  That truck became  two a  few years  later and then came the time for the big  step when they bought their :first tractor  and trailer. Hard work and drive brought  more and more business to Hill, who was  never too busy to offer his services for  the benefit of his community.  Seeing a need for warehouses for the  storage of household goods in the Ocala  area. he built his  :first warehouse of  10,000 square feet in 1959. Since then  there have been two additions to that  facility along with the construction of  two additional warehouses. In 1963, Hll1  opened a branch in Gainesville and that  too has continued to grow,  the ware house there having been expanded twice.  11059  It is a family operation with his four  sons now assuming the major day-to-day  operation of the business. William Ken neth, James Michael, Jerry Eugene, and  Joseph Donald have presented the Hills  with their pride and joy, 10 grandchil dren.  One of the things that has given Bill  the most pleasure and pride is the fact  that all four sons are Masons.  It seems  remarkable  that  this busy  man would have been able to devote so  much of his time in service to others.  One of the great honors which he has  received wa.s the National Medallion of  Honor for his work as president of the  Ocala Boys Club. That is pretty signifi cant when you  realize only one such  award is given nationally each year.  Seeing that most of his friends are  Masons, he  petitioned Marion Dunn  Lodge in Ocala and was made a Ma.ster  Mason in August of 1948. His rise in Ma sonic  circles was predictable as year  after year  this affable gentleman was  called upon for service in the most re sponsible positions.  Perhaps the most enjoyable and bene fl.cial period has been his service on the  board of trustees of the Masonic Home  since 1965. This is the home operated by  the Masons of Florida and tremendous  progress has been made in its renovation  and upgrading over the past decade-a  tribute to Hill and all of the other Ma sons who have given so unselfishly of  their time and talents to make it the in stitution of service it is today.  It was natural  that Bill should be  called to the highest office of the frater nity and it was 4 years ago that he was  elected  to  the om.ce of  junior grand  warden, where advancement is automatic  by tradition. It has been a priceless pe riod of service, culminating in Tampa the  last of this month where he presides as  grand master.  Bill is a 33d Degree Scottish Rite Ma. son, holds the York Rite honor of Red  Cross of Constantine, has received the  DeMolay Legion of Honor, and has held  numerous offices such as worthy patron  of his Eastern Star Chapter and royal  patron of the Order of Amaranth Chap ter. He has been active in the work of  the Shrine, heading his Shrine Club in  1959.  Professionally, he is a member of the  Florida Trucking Conference and has  served three terms as chairman of the  Florida Movers Conference. He was  president of the very active Ocala Lions  Club in 1968 and has held other positions  of civic responsibility in the hometown  he loves so much.  Hill's Van Service serves as agents for  Fogarty Brothers Transfer of Tampa,  Fla., and business continues  to grow.  While Bill looks down the road to turn ing everything over to ""my boys,"" it is  hard to imagine this big man-in heart  and stature-inactive.  He is an example of what an American  can achieve. Nobody ever gave him any thing. America just gave a  fine young  couple an opportunity and they did the  rest. And, none of it would have been  worthwhile without Gladys. She is one  lady that everyone loves. She has been  a constant compass whenever the seas  ",1976

157,Senate,94,-0.55,946,9,Mr. CLARK.," Mr. President, for  the  sixth consecutive year, the coalition for  health funding has produced an lnf orma tive booklet that discusses the funding  of Federal health programs for the com ing fiscal year.  The coalition for health funding rep resents over 50 national organizations  that are dedicated to uplifting the level  of health care in this Nation. The coali tion annually publishes an analysis of the  President's health budget and proposes  alternatives to this budget.  The 1977 report cites the inadequacy  of the President's recommendation to re duce health spending from the 1976 level  of $5.5 billion to $4.8 blllion. This $700  million  reduction would affect various  health programs, but by far  the most  disastrous cuts are in the area of health  services. Whereas the health services ap propriation for the current fiscal year is  $1.2 billion,  the President proposes  spend only $900 million for these pro grams in the next fiscal year.  Community health centers would suffer  a loss of about $40 million. These neigh borhood clinics, operating in medically  underserved urban and rural locales, pro vide family oriented primary care serv ices to almost 2 milllon Americans. The  health revenue sharing program, which  finances preventive health activities by  to  the States, would lose all of its funding  if the President's plan were enacted. Pro grams in maternal and child health and  in family planning would be forced  to  sharply curtail their activities.  The Federal effort to help those with  mental health and alcoholism problems  would also be undermined, as these two  programs would lose more than one-third  of their funding. Although the Congress  made a firm commitment to community based  treatment of mental illness and  alcoholism, the 1977 budget reflects an  abandonent of this mandate.  Many of this Nation's health manpower  programs would not escape the scissors  of the budget cutters. Direct financial  assistance to medical students would be  reduced by  two-fifths, while  the nurse  training program would be forced to ab sorb a cut of 65 percent. Federal fund ing  for  health  facilities  construction  would be terminated entirely if the Presi dent's recommendations took effect.  The coalition for health funding con cluded that the President's health budget  would have a ""devastating effect on the  Nation's health."" The organization notes  that-At a  time when the Bureau of Labor Sta tistics estimates the increase in the medical  care component of the Consumer Index to  be 10.3%, ... the adm.in1strat1on proposes  to reduce Federal health spending by some  11.4%. At a time when many of the Nation's  urban centers answer the threat of virtual  bankruptcy with drastic budget cuts,  the  administration proposes that the States a.nd  localities pick up  a  greater share of  the  health funding tab. At a time when an ever  increasing number of poor, aged, and dis abled citizens must rely on direct health care  services provided by the Federal Government  as the sole source of such services, the ad ministration proposes to reduce the funding  level of these services to a. point where most  of them would be rendered inetfective.  training,  The  coalition  recommends  that all  controllable health programs be restored  to their fiscal 1976 operating levels, and  it places a high budget priority on break through  research,  essential  comprehensive planning and develop ment, and direct community services.  There are a few bright spots in Presi dent Ford's 1977 health budget. Proposed  increases in the National Health Service  Corps, National Health Service scholar ships, and nurse practitioner  training  would help  improve  the access  to  health care in rural areas. However, the  support for rural health programs is sig nificantly eroded by proposed cutbacks in  funding for community health centers  and for emergency medical services.  Other programs that would receive in creased  funds  under  the President's  budget are  the Indian health service,  community programs of drug abuse pre vention, and health manpower capita tion grants.  The coalition for health funding has  decided  that $5.8 billion  ls needed  to  maintain current Federal initiatives  to  in  health services, research, and training  that are so essential to our Nation's well being. This assessment is in accordance  with the first 1977 budget resolution that  passed the Senate in April. The resolu tion allocated. $6 billion for this health  funding.  I  request unanimous consent that a  table outlining several health budget pro posals be printed at this point in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the table was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  FEDERAL HEALTH FUNDING  (In billions of dollars)  1976  appropnation  President's  1977  budget  First  1977  budget  resoluti on  Coalition  for  health  fundinf  197  budget  Health Services  Administration. ____  National Institutes of  Health_----------Alcohol, Drug Abuse,  Mental Health  Administration _____  Health Resources  Administration.---TotaL    1.2  2. 5  .8  1. 0  5. 5  0.9  2. 3  .8  .9  4. 9  1. 3  2. 8  .9  1. 0  6.0  1.2  2.5  1. 0  1.1  5.8  ",1976

161,,94,-0.397,1141,9,Mr. HUMPHREY.," Mr. President,  I  strongly urge the Senate to pass S. 3295.  Housing Amendments of 1976, to extend  authorizations for certain Federal pro grams to provide critically needed hous ing for low and moderate-income fam ilies. I oppose the motion to recommit  to the committee this urgently needed  legislation.  Recent public debates over the loca tion of this housing have missed com pletely the central problem, which is the  administration's failure  to pursue na tional goals  for new construction, as  mandated by Congress.  S. 3295 addresses this central problem  by emphasizing the need for new hous ing  construction under  current pro grams of  the Department of Housing  and Urban Development. If these au thorizations are fully utilized, we can  produce over 640,000 new or substan tially rehabilitated units of housing by  the end of fiscal year 1977. Equally im portant, this can generate over one mil lion jobs for construction workers, who  have eXPerienced depression-level un employment over recent years.  A major portion of assistance author ized under this bill is for the section 202  direct loan program for elderly and han dicapped housing, expressing the deter mination of Congress that the administration should meet this urgent need  without further delay. The bill also ear marks  funds  for  the construction of  public housing and for new construction  under the section 8 housing assistance  program. It is the clear intent of Con gress that HUD should substantially re direct program activities which have re sulted in an extremely low level of new  housing starts.  At the same time, the bill wisely pro vides essential authorization for operat ing subsidies for public housing. And,  authorized levels of funding for the sec tion 235 homeownership program and  Section 312 rehabilitation loans will help  sustain a  comprehensive approach  in  meeting the housing needs of lower-and  moderate-income families.  Finally, while I regret that it has been  found necessary to reduce the authoriza tion for the section 701 comprehensive  planning grant program, I believe the  committee report on this bill makes a  strong case for this program which helps  communities deal with the complex prob lems of growth and which is a highly  important mechanism for assuring the  effective use of Federal assistance.  Mr. President, a brief review of the  ebb and :flow of administration policies  over  the past several years will make  clear why the enactment of S. 3295 is of  great importance.  Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of  1968, as amended, prohibits discrimina tion in housing on the basis of race, na tional  origin,  religion,  and  sex. The  statute basically  calls  for  affirmative  efforts to achieve voluntary compliance,  through such methods as conference,  conciliation and persuasion. Popularly  termed the ""Fair Housing Act,"" this law  built upon a 1962 Presidential Executive  Order which had begun a long and dif ficult process of reversing past Federal  policies and practices connected with  housing assistance since World Warn,  which had worked all too often to foster  housing segregation.  There was a brief period in 1970 when  the Department of Housing and Urban  Development advised the Commission on  Civil Rights that its policy in administer ing the 1968  law was ""the creation of  open communities which will provide an  opportunity for individuals to live within  a  reasonable distance of their job and  daily activities by  increasing housing  options  for  low-income  and minority  families.""  But this policy was abandoned in the  midst of false rhetoric from the White  House that the administration would not  ""force"" the integration of neighborhoods.  This was  a  total  distoration of  the  principle that any American should have  equal access to decent housing, that there  should be no artificial restraints to exer cising  this right-that,  in short, any  citizen, regardless of race, creed, color,  nationality, or  ethnic background,  is  entitled to live where he or she wants to  live, so long as they can afford this hous ing and abide by the ordinances.  In 1972, HUD issued project selection  criteria to be used in rating applications  from communities for participation in  subsidized housing. The main objective of  four of these criteria was that subsidized  and public housing projects would be  constructed outside of areas of existing  minority  and  poverty  concentrations.  The proposed project must: Frist, serve  urgent  unmet  needs  for  low-income  ",1976

Mr. Williamson paints a very bleak  picture of life in the Soviet Union, as  he says in the editorial:  I might trade our subways for Moscow's,  but after that, Soviet life loses on most every  count.  The simple fact is the Soviet economy  is not nearly as advanced as they would  lead us to believe. While this Nation can  increase  its defense spending yet still  provide a decent standard of living for its  citizenry-the Soviet Union's expendi tures on defense have come at the ex pense of the common people who must  struggle just to eke out an existence.  Mr. Wllliamson also focuses on the  repressive nature of Soviet life. Freedom  of speech, religion and assembly, which  are  the cornerstones of  this Nation's  democracy are but myths in the Soviet  Union. Many in this Nation know of the  problems which Soviet Jews encounter  both living in and trying to emigrate  from the Soviet Union.  I am pleased to provide my colleagues  with the opportunity to read Mr. Wil liamson's assessment of life in the Soviet  Union. It should make us all thankful to  be Americans.  to  Goon To BE BACK  (By Robert Williamson)  You never really appreciate something Uke freedom-until it is gone. That truism  haunted me during a  recent visit  the  soviet Union.  I might trade our subways for Moscow's,  but after that, Soviet life loses on most every  count.  With all our gripes about the cost of living,  consider that the average American works 12  minutes for a dozen eggs, while our comrade  labors 93 minutes. A Russian puts in 157  hours for a ma.n's suit, an American only 26  hours. And while it takes six months salary  for us to buy a car, lt takes nearly 4 years in  Russia.

LEGGETT  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, April 27, 1976  Mr.  LEGGET!'. Mr.  Speaker,  the  problems of United States-U.S.S.R. rela tions and the nature and character of  Soviet-American  detente-indeed,  the  meaning and utility of the word itself have received increasing attention as we  have moved further into  this political  year. For several months, a debate has  been brewing-how ""great"" it has been  ts another matter-about the directions  we should be taking in dealing with the  Soviets.  The dire warnings of the great Soviet  novelist, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, have  been echoed in the campaigns of former  Governor Reagan, President Ford, Sen ator JACKSON, and others. We have heard  that the Soviets are cheating and takApril 27, 1976  to  ing advantage of us in SALT; that we  should  concentrate on building  arms  rather than seeking to control them. We  also hear that the ""fall"" of one country,  Angola,  to a Soviet-sponsored  f actlon  is but the beginning of a Communist  move across the face of southern Africa.  Distilled  its essence, what we have  been hearing is a vertiable Spenglerian  prophecy that the West as we know it  faces its demise at the hands of the Red  menace in the foreseeable future, unless  we radically alter our military and for eign policies.  Central to this prophecy is Solzhen itsyn's notion that detente is itself dan gerous, no more than a process in which  the Soviets  implacably pursue and at tain their objectives without the need to  resort to force, while the West dreams  on in its materialistic slumber. The pic ture is one of Communist advance, with  the West  too weak  to resist,  in both  power and will. And the underlying pre mise is that the military balance between  the U.S.S.R. and its allies on one hand,  and the Western states on the other, has  eroded  to  the point where  the West  lacks, or soon will lack, sufficient means  to offer a credible challenge to the Com munist onslaught.  I believe we must carefully examine  these warnings--the  recrudescence of  cold war thinking and the view of the bal ance of power which it implies. But just  as we cannot blindly dismiss them, neith er should we accept  this view without  careful analysis. In fact, I think a dispas sionatee  examination of  the military  and political situation will show that a  broader perspective  is needed  than a  simple  either-or-choice  between  cold  war and detente.  My view is that the choice we face is  not between cold war and detente, but  how, and in what form,  to pursue de tente. And this choice springs, not from  some errant policymaker's whim, but  from the basic structure of the interna tional situation.  The hesitant movement of recent years  toward detent grows necessarily out of  the advent of the nuclear stalemate the awareness  that both sides possess  such an enormity of nuclear force that  either can destroy the other as a func tioning society no matter what the other  may do, even with its own preemptive  attack. There is ample evidence that this  awareness  of  the  devastating  conse quences of escalation beyond the nuclear  threshold  is  the major factor govern ing decisions by both superpowers about  the resort to force when one faces the  risks of confrontation with  the other.  As we contemplate  these risks,  it is  necessary to focus on the military di mension of our  relationship with  the  Soviets. Despite the alarums raised dur ing  the campaign,  I  believe  the U.S.  strategic deterrent is now, and will re main,  invulnerable, and  the programs  proposed by the military and authorized  in the defense bill recently voted by the  House are more than adequate to main tain a sufficiency of nuclear force for the  foreseeable future. In fact, I  think the  bill goes beyond the bounds of what is  necessary with programs  like the B-1  bomber, which is simply not needed for  deterrence, and  the  terminally guided  ",1976

173,Senate,94,-0.169,79,15,Mr. STONE.," Mr. President, I share the  view of most Americans that government  at all levels has grown so fast and furious  over the past several decades  that we  have almost lost the ability to control it  and to understand its impact on our eco nomic, social, and political institutions.  One measure of the accelerated growth  and activity of government is the dra matic increase in legislation considered  and enacted into law by the U.S. Con gress. While the bulk of Federal legisla tion has been enacted in a serious effort  to solve genuine problems in our coun try, the programs established and agen cies created often seem to contribute very  little to solving the problems for which  they were designed. Quite often  these  programs and agencies continue to exist  long after their usefulness is gone. Very  seldom do Members of Congress and the  committees of Congress take the time  to review the continued validity and util ity of Federal policies and programs once  they are established.  There are many reasons why Congress  has been rather ineffective in exercising  its oversight responsibilities with respect  to Federal programs. One of these is the  conspicuous absence of a  rational and  regular mechanism for the review of the  existing body of Federal statutes. Con gress passes more and more legislation  every year with little attention to what it  has already done in the past. We rarely  take time to look back and determine  whether a law 1s still needed or whether  it is no longer necessary and should be  repealed. For this reason I am introduc ing a joint resolution, entitled the public  law revision resolution.  The  resolution would  require  each  standing committee of the House and the  Senate to come up with a plan for a con tinuing review of all of the existing Fed eral statutes under  their  jurisdiction,  with a view toward revising and repealing statutes which have become anti quated or unnecessary. The plans, which  will be submitted to the Speaker of the  House or the President pro tempore of  the Senate, shall include provisions for  staff support, hearings and any investi gations that may be necessary. In addi tion each committee shall describe in its  plan: how it intends  to utilize  its own  staff resources. For example, some com mittees might want to set up a sepa rate subcommittee to deal with revisions  and repealers, some committees may pre fer to work with the Library of Congress  or the Office of Legislative Counsel.  As an example of some of the laws that  are still on the statute books but which  no longer have any practical effect, I am  also introducing a bill to repeal a few of  these laws. These are the kinds of laws  which the standing committees of Con gress would review if my joint resolution  is adopted.  The bill I am introducing today would  repeal several laws dealing with Indians  and Indian agents. The role of Indian  agents has been eliminated since 1908.  Therefore, 25 U.S.C. 27, 29, 30, 31, and  32 are no longer necessary. I also urge  the repeal of 25 U.S.C.  regarding  the practice of issuing army rations to  Indians. This practice is no longer fol lowed and the law should be repealed. In  addition, I urge the repeal of 25 U.S.C.  187. It is dependent upon specifics out lined in section 186 relating to trespass ing on lands of civilized Indians which  was repealed in 1934. Thus 187  is  left  without basis; 25 U.S.C. 126, rel~ting to  the payment of claims for Indian depre dation, is also obsolete and should be re pealed.  There are a number of other statutes  which I have found to be antiquated and  I will introduce repealer bills from time  to time to emphasize the need for com mittees to take responsibility in this area  by passing the public law revision resolu tion.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the public law revi sion resolution and the Repealer Act of  1976 be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill and  joint  resolution were  ordered  to  be  printed in the RECORD, as follows:  141  S.3561  Be  it enacted by  the Senate and House  of Representatives of the United States of  America in Congress assembled, That this Act  may be cited as the ""Repealer Act of 1976"".

Not later than the last day of the  first session of the Ninety-fifth Congress of  the United States of America, each standing  committee of the House of Representatives  and each standing committee of the Senate  shall submit to the Speaker of the House of  Representatives and the President pro tem pore of the Senate, respectively, a plan for  a comprehensive review of all existing Fed eral statutes with respect to which any such  committee has legislative jurisdiction with a  view  toward  revising  and  repealing  such  statutes as may be appropriate.  SEc. 3. The plan required under section 2  shall provide for such hearings,  investiga tions, and committee staff support work as  each such committee may deem necessary  or appropriate.  SEc. 4. The plan required under section 2  shall  specify provisions which,  if  imple mented by law, would specify how each such  committee will utilize  the resources of its  own professional staff,  the Library of Con gress, the Office of Legislative Counsel and,  as may be necessary or useful, the Office of  the Law Revision Counsel for purposes of  carrying out the provisions of this Act.  By Mr. HUGH SCOTT:  S. 3562. A bill  to amend  the  tariff  schedules of the United States to pro vide that certain netting belts used in  connection with the growing and har vesting of mushrooms be admitted free  of duty. Referred to the Committee on  Finance.  Mr. HUGH SCOTT. Mr. President, our  domestic mushroom industry has been  under attack for over 10 years as a  re.:.  suit of the continued plague of imported  mushrooms. The seriousness of this mat ter was recognized by the U.S. Interna tional Trade Commission-ITC-and on  March 17, 1976, by a majority vote, rec ommended to the President that import  relief be provided. The Commission de termined that mushrooms provided for  in item 144.20 of the Tariff Schedules of  the United States are being imported in  such increased quantities as to be a sub stantial cause of serious injury or threat  thereof  to  the domestic  industry, and  recommended  the provision of adjust ment assistance to remedy that injury.  The Pennsylvania congressional delega tion voiced its concern earlier this year  that adjustment assistance to our domes tic  canners would not  be  proximate  enough in time to bring relief. By letter  dated April 14, 1976, to the President, the  congressional delegation urged that the  most appropriate remedy should be tariff  adjustment in the form of either a tariff rate quota or an orderly marketing agree ment. On May 13, 1976, the decision of  the ITC prevailed.  In this atmosphere of domestic strife  in our mushroom community, I am in troducing a bill to provide a measure of  relief to this struggling, yet proud in dustry. This  legislation would  amend  the Tariff  Schedules  of  the United  States to provide  that certain netting  belts used in connection with the grow ing and harvesting of mushrooms be ad mitted free of duty. It is important to  note here that this type of netting is not  available in this country. I am pleased  that Congressman Richard T. Schulze  has introduced similar legislation in the  House of Representatives.  ",1976

DENIAL OF FOREIGN TAX CREDIT  FOR BRIDE-PRODUCED  INCOME  HON. HERBERT E. HARRIS II  OF VmGINIA  IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 14, 1976  run  ",1976
179,,94,-0.324,274,15,Mr. HARRIS.," Mr. Speaker, I am dis mayed by recent reports that Lockheed,  Gulf, and a number of other American  corporations have systematically tried to  corrupt the governments of our neigh bors and allies with bribes and other il legal payments. Such activity endangers  harmonious  relations  with  foreign  powers and  threatens  to disrupt  the  world trade markets.  Ostensibly, this corruptive behavior is  predicated on the desire to increase for eign sales and  thus corporate profits.  This is not good business practice-sales  should be won on the quality of the prod uct and not on gifts to high-ranking of ficials of foreign governments.  My constituents have made it clear to  me that they do not want American firms  engaging in this type of activity. While  in the short run a few corporations might  benefit by a few well-placed bribes. in the  long  corporate  corruption might  force a change of governmental systems  abroad and thus restrict trade markets.  At the very least, foreign governments  will be fearful of making trade agree ments for fear that their own people will  infer that some illegal activity occurred.  In order to deter this unfortunate cor porate activity abroad, today, I am intro ducing a  bill  to amend  the  Internal  Revenue Code of 1954 to deny certain  benefits to taxpayers who make bribes  or other illegal payments to officials or  agents of foreign governments. Specifi cally, corporations that earn bribe-pro duced  income are denied  foreign  tax  credits, deferrals, and DISC benefits un der the bill.  Further, my bill  requires  taxpayers  with foreign source income derived di rectly or indirectly as a result of payment  to an official, employee, or agent of a for eign government to report to the Secre tary of Treasury the amount of such pay ment by the corporation and the amount  of income received as a result of the pay ment. The Secretary is directed to deter mine whether this income should be des ignated  as  ""bribe-produced  income""  Willful failure to make such a report is  punishable by a  fine of not more than  imprisonment of not more  than 1 year, or both.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, I believe that  we should do away with the foreign tax  credit altogether. In my opinion, the for eign tax credit is a loophole that allows  corporations  to avoid paying their fair  share of taxes. In essence, foreign taxes  are business expenses and should be con sidered as a business expense for domes tic tax purposes. Federal taxes should be  levied on  the net  income of corpora tions-that is, upon income minus busi ness expenses-the profit of the firm.  $25,000 or  REPRESENTATIVE JACK KEMP SA LUTES BUFFALO EVENING NEWS AMERICAN LEGION ESSAY CON TESTANTS  HON.

185,House,94,-0.553,352,15,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  in support of the Fraser amendment to  cut  funding  for  the  construction of  Lonetree Reservoir from  the Garrison  diversion project appropriation. Lonetree  Reservoir represents a critical step in a  project with heayy .Federal. regional, and  Canadian opposition. The construction  of this reservoir should be delayed until  these problems are resolved.  The Garrison diversion unit is an en vironmental mistake that will seriously  degrade American and Canadian waters  with polluted irrigation return flows car rying chemicals and salts leached from  the soil, as well .as pesticides, fertilizers,  and other wastes associated with fann ing operations. It will damage eight na tional wildlife  refuges,  destroy  acres of wetlanrls, with possible losses of  annual production of 350,000 waterfowl.  It will consume 220,000 acres of  land  50,~00  for right-of-way, of which 70,000 acres  presently are being farmed. All this to  irrigate 250,000  acres presently being  farmed without irrigation.  A ""Dear Colleague"" letter in support of  the Garrison project, states that GAO  finds the benefit-to-cost ratio and quality  of return flow best of 22 western irriga tion projects. It also contends that recent  studies by the Bureau of Reclamation;  their contractor, Harza Engineers; and  N~rth Dakota State University all find  return  flows beneficial. Let us  take a  closer look at those claims.  What are the economic benefits? The  Bureau of Reclamation based its estimate  of benefits on the increased income to  farmer8 from using their land more in tensively through in-igation. This project  wlli only benefit landowners rich enough  to a:f!ord an  investment  in  irrigation  equipment estimated at over $40,000 per  160 acres. These landowners will not pay  the costs of constructing the Garrison di version unit, estimated at $500 million  and still rising. Less than 5 percent of  project costs allocated to irrigation will  be paid by those who receive the direct  benefits. These costs will be paid by Fed eral taxpayers and consumers of electric ity generated at the existing Garrison  Dam.  Are the return flows beneficia,!? These  return fiows may be beneficial to the ir rigators who are discharging the polluted  waters, but  they are not beneficial  to  those who are receiving them. The Min nesota pollution control agency has re viewed the Harza report and maintains  that there are serious water quality vio lations by the project. The Government  of Canada, and the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency and Council on En vironmental Quality have not changed  their position  that  a moratorium be  placed on further construction of  this  project.  Is the quality of return flow  in this  project best of 22 Western  irrigation  projects? Perhaps the Bureau of Rec lamation's record should be examined  more carefully. Irrigation projects on the  Colorado River caused such an increase  in salinity that it has required desalina tion  treatment costing $280 million  to  clean this water before it enters Mexico.  We are now facing this prospect with  the Garrison diversion unit. The State  Department .has assured Canada that no  part of the project will be constructed  which would degrade Canadian waters.  However, if Lonetree Reservoir is used, as  intended,  to supply irrigation water to  the Souris and Red River Basins, it will  severely degrade Canadian water quality.  TI Lonetree Reservoir is constructed, the  next decision facmg Congress may be  much  costlier: Construct  a Colorado  River-style desalination plant to clean  the Souris and Red Rivers before enter ing Canada, or abandon Lonetree Res ervoir and identify new irrigation sites  outside the Souris and Red River Basins.  What particularly disturbs me is the  potential loss of wetlands, waterfowl, and  damage  to wildlife refuges 1'rom this  project. Congress recently expressed its  commitment to preserving valuable wet lands  in H.R.  5608 which  authorizes  $114.1 million for wetlands acquisition  from 1976 to 1983. Should we pay to pre serve wetlands with one hand, and pay  to destroy them with the other hand?  This project is a major setback to our  wetlands preservation program.  We cannot ignore the serious opposi tion of environmental agencies of Can ada, the United States, and Minnesota,  as well as opposition of the South Dakota  State Legislature.  Now is the time to carefully consider  the implications of this project to deter mine how to modify the Garrison diver sion unit so as '.;o eliminate the major en vironmental problems. Failure to act now  lead  to environmental headaches  and soaring project costs far into the  future.  <By unanimous consent, Mr. HAGEDORN  yielded his time to ",1976

187,House,94,-0.306,378,15,Mr. HANLEY.," Mr. Speaker, subsequent  to Jim Farley's death, in this Chamber  I offered some remarks, adding that cer liainly many, many words would be ex pressed related to him, thus in concert  with that prediction I attach a descrip tive accounting which recently appeared  in the New York Times:  AT FARLEY FUNERAL, ALL Is NOT SADNESS  (By Francis X. Clines)  James A. Farley was buried yesterday after  a final salute from the great clan of politi cians whose ambitions and stratagems were  the consuming joy of his long life.  A crowd of 1,500 at St. Patrick's Cathedral  attended the funeral of the master politician  in a friendly gathering that was as much a  glowing political event as a  religious cere mony of final passage.  ""Life for so many of us can become such  an anticlimax,"" the Rev. Robert J. Gannon  said in the funeral homily about his long time friend. ""It's nice to go when everyone  is still saying, 'Stay.'""  This struck the theme of the crowd, which  mourned the passing of the 88-year-old man,  but even more reminisced about his life with  sm,iles and laughter. There also was the dis play of some of the man's personal letters---: signed ""Jim"" in green ink-that marked Mr.  Farley's course through one of the most sue-  cessful  individual careers in the history of  American politics.  LETTERS TELL STORY  ""Look at this,"" said Representative James  L. Delaney, the stocky, white-haired politi cian from Queens as he unfolded a  recent  Farley  letter while waiting  to serve as an  honorary pallbearer. The letter was a  twopage message of personal wishes and inter esting observations in which, on June 4, Mr.  .Farley  concluded  there was no  stopping  Jimmy Carter's bid for the Democratic nomination for President.  Mr. Farley's current observation of Demo crats, whom he served and prodded for dec ades, was: ""The situation in the party is,  of course, extremely mixed up."" Numerous  Democrats were making the same point in  private chats after the funeral crowd dis solved on the steps of the cathedral into a  talkative band whose more prominent mem bers moved  quickly  in  front  of  the TV  cameras.  It reached such a garrulous and contented  mood that only minutes after the hearse de parted for  the Farley family plot at Gate  of Heaven cemetery in Hawthorne, N.Y.,  a  woman exiting from a cab observed: ""A wed ding must have  just ended.''  The  towering  interior  of St. Patrick's  served well for the ceremony, for the cathe dral not only represents the favored place  of  departure  for  ranking Catholic  poli ticians, but it also was Mr. Farley's neigh borhood church where he was a  commu nicant and usher. He would worship in or  near  the 25th pew at the 9 A.M. Sunday  mass, and  then greet old  friends on  the  steps outside the south door before walk ing back  to his  residence at  the Waldorf  Towers.  ""Look-Carey and Buckley went to com munion together,"" said Robert Palermo, an  usher who knew Mr. Farley. ""From differ ent parties,"" he said, as if in tribute to Mr.  Farley's power to bring together such dif ferent souls as  the Governor and Senator  James L. Buckley.  The Governor  led  a group  of  somber suited political and business  leaders who  knew Mr. Farley well. It included Leonard  W. Hall,  the  former Republican national  chairman who, as an old  friend and ad versary  Farley, was  representing  President Ford. Representing another pillar  of Mr. Farley's life was a  line of Roman  Catholic clergy, arrayed  in brilliant white  and scarlet vestments and  led by Terence  Cardinal Cooke.  of Mr.  THE CARDINAL PRESIDED  Cardinal Cooke presided at the Mass of  the Resurrection,  the modernized Catholic  funeral ceremony devoid of the dirge and  black color of the past. The chief celebrant  was Bishop Edwin Broderick,  formerly of  the Albany Diocese and now with Catholic  Relief Services, and the assisting hierarchy  included Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen and  Bishop Francis J. Mugavero of Brooklyn.  ""May the soul of James Aloysius Farley,  beloved  father,  cheerful Christian gentle man, faithful public servant-may his soul  and all the souls of the faithful departed  rest in peace,"" the Cardinal declared bless ing the coffin, which rested on a carriage at  the head of the center aisle and was cov ered with a white cloth imprinted with the  Greek letters alpha and omega, symbolizing  the beginning and ending that is life.  ""He used to think of himself as playing  hooky from heaven,"" said Father Gannon,  the  retired president of Fordham Univer sity,  in  commenting  on  Farley's  -longevity.  Mr.  DID A JIMMY CARTER  However,  his  skill  in  having  piloted  Franklin Delano Roosevelt to the Presidency  was hardly dated in the eyes of much of  the  crowd, and Father Gannon,  in  trying  to describe the overwhelming Roosevelt vic tory strategy, said of Mr. Farley's sweeping,  thorough style: ""He did -a Jimmy Carter.''  The passing of Mr. Farley and the arrival  of Mr. Carter's time was symbolized in the  milling prowd wJ.?,en-the Governor, while  reminiscing about Mr. Farley's integrity and  respected personal  touch, reached across a  few people to shake the hand of William J.  vanden Heuvel. He is a New York politician  whose party fortunes have risen since he  chose to be the Carter chairman in the state  well  before  the  candidate  apparently  clinched  the Presidential nomination and  while the Governor was maintaining neu trality.  One of the Governor's political advisers,  Jerry Cummins,  the chairman of the New  York State Thruway Authority, lingered to  chat with Mr. vanden Heuvel in the breezy  sunlight outside the cathedral.

It took the form of a  commemoration  held on Saturday, May 15, 1976, in the  historic Paulskirche  in Frankfurt am  Main. In this ceremony at this uniquely  appropriate spot, the attention of Ger mans, Americans, and indeed of a  large  part of the world was directed  to the  ideals that both nations share. There was  a restatement of the common aspirations  of our peoples as well as a candid ac knowledgement of where we have both  fallen short of our best hopes and a new  resolve to realize the great potential that  German and American  leaders of  the  widest vision and  the best perception  have seen as being within our reach.  The thoughtful choice of a historic site,  the attendance of a brilliant assembly of  representatives of all walks of  life  in  Germany, the presence of the President  of the Federal Republic, Walter Scheel;  the Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt,  and  many other officials of government, the  warm hospitality of Rudi Arndt,  lord  mayor of Frankfurt, all contributed to  making this a tribute to the founding of  the American Republic for which we are  deeply grateful and of which we are  deeply proud.  The ceremony was opened with a wel come extended by Dr. Konrad Henkel in  which he personally greeted those of us  from the United States privileged to be  present  including  the Honorable John  McCloy, Mrs. Dean Acheson and Mrs.  Eleanor Lansing Dunes.  In concluding remarks, Prince Witt genstein, chairman of the German Asso ciation for International Politics, noted:  How natural that our Country should turn  its gaze more and more towards that great  America which has remained faithful to the  principles of 1776, which has become strong  because  it was  free, which has become a  magnet for the poor of the world, the vig orous, and the capable, and which has solved  its internal problems peacefully, even if in  recent times we have sometimes had to strug gle to understand these processes.

194,Senate,94,-0.247,534,15,Mr. RANDOLPH.," Mr. President,  I  think the pending amendment is avery  important  approach  to  a  hoped-for  understanding by the Senate and Con gress. The American people as a whole,  as we continue haltingly to address the  need for energy policy  in the United  States of America, must also come to  fully unde1stand the need.  It is old hat for me to express such an  opinion, having offered in 1959 legisla tion to create a national commission to  address  this  problem.  In 1961  I  at tempted  to do  that again. Before the  Committee on Interior and Insular Af fairs, I stated, ''Each year that we de lay,  that is,  in creating the policy on  fuels and energy, perhaps brings us one  yea1 nearer to disaster :   The record of my effort tells the whole  story. It bea1s repeating as we debate  tonight.  On August 1a, 1~59, I introduced Sen ate Concunent Resolution 73, to create  a Joint Committee on a National Fuels  Policy. The resolution was cosponsored  by some 43 Senators ..  Dming the 86th Congress, on September 2, 1959, the Committee on Interior  and Insular Affairs reported favorably  our Senate Concurrent Resolution 73 to  create a Joint Committee on a National  Fuels Policy. The committee noted the  ""widespread and growing concern, both  within and without the Halls of Con gress, in respect to the adequacy of the  Nation's fuel and energy 1esources ...  and  the lack of a national policy  for  the most effective utilization of these re sources,  in the best public interest.""  The  resolution,  Senate Concurrent  Resolution 73, was referred to the Sen ate Committee on Rules and Administra tion, where it died. There was  insuffi cient sentiment for the joint committee  concept, particularly  in  the House of  Representatives,  to assure  its eventual  establishment. However, out of that idea  for a congressional study came action  by the White House in 1959 when Presi dent Eisenhower established by Execu tive order a mandatory oil import quota  program.  In 1960 the need for a comprehensive  national fuels and energy policy became  a major political issue. Both Democratic  and Republican Party platforms  sup ported a national fuels policy and long range n;Unerals and fuels planning and  programing. I urged the National Demo cratic Platform Committee to act on this  vital  issue. The Democratic platform  contained  the  following  declaration:  ""We suppmt the establishment of ana tional  fuels  policy."" The Republican  platform in 1960 also declared for ""long range minerals and fuels planning and  programing.""  On January 19, 1961, my proposal for  a Joint Committee on a National Fuels  Study was reintroduced in the 87th Con gress as Senate Concurrent Resolution 4.  In  all  there were  55  cosponsoring  Senators.  By March 1961, however, it was ap parent that the joint committee proposal  had little chance for success. Therefore  on March 2, 1961, I  introduced Senate  Resolution 105 providing for creation of  a Senate Special Committee on a Na tional Fuels Study.  Senate Resolution 105 was one of the  most widely sponsored  legislative pro posals of the 87th Congress or any other  Congress. A  truly bipartisan effort with  63 cosponsors.  As passed by the Senate on September  11, 1961, Senate Resolution 105-87th  Congress-instructed the Senate Com mittee on Interior and Insular Affairs to  undertake a study as a basis for possible  revision of national fuels and energy pol icies, including the possibility of new leg islation.  In testimony on Senate Resolution 105  before the Senate Interior Committee on  June 12, 1961, I observed that""In June 1961, the world-the United  States included, of course-has available  more energy fuels in the form of coal,  oil, and natural gas than currently we  can use. In reference to oil, the word,  I  think, is 'glut.' F.rom recent oil discover ies in North Africa, it would appear that  there are still vast sources of supply that  have not yet been discovered. Who knows  what the continent of Africa may hold  in the way of energy?  ",1976

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  IMPORTANT NEW APPROACH TO  MEDICAL EDUCATION  HON. WILLIAM D. FORD  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 15, 1976  ",1976
196,,94,-0.516,586,15,Mr. FORD of Michigan.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like to bring to the attention of  my colleagues a new approach to medi cal education at Michigan State Univer sity's College of Human Medicine.  Doctors have been accused by some of  knowing a great deal about medicine and  little about people. The medical college  of MSU has created a curriculum plan  premised on the behalf that attention  to  the  individual patient, his  feelings,  personality and background is vitally im portant  to  the  successful practice of  medicine.  At this time, I enter into the RECORD  a New York Times article from June 8  describing the Michigan State University  program and how it is working to benefit  the citizens of my State:  MICHIGAN  STATE'S YOUNG MEDICAL  ScHOOL  BECOMES COLLEGE OF THE BEDSIDE MANNER  (By Boyce Rensberger)  EAST LANSING, MICH.-Michigan State Uni versity's  young  and  innovative medical  school, with its headquarters here and stu dents in training all over Michigan, could be  called the College of the Bedside Manner.  In a  time when people increasingly criti cize the impersonality of doctors who know  much about their specialties and little about  people, M.S.U.'s College of Human Medicine  is devoting a major effort  to turning out  doctors who are not only up-to-date but who  combine the warmth of the old-time family  doctor with a grasp of the often neglected  social and environmental factors  in illness.  ""The establishment school says medicine  is applied biological science,"" said Dr. Andrew  D. Hunt, dean of the college. ""We say medi cine is basically a helping profession and ap plied biological science is merely one tool.  We want our graduates to have other tools  such as an understanding of human behavior,  social factors, ethics, community organiza tion and so forth ..  ""We feel the medical school should work  towards meeting the needs of society,"" Dr.  Hunt went on. ""Our objective  is  to move  with the rest of society toward meeting those  needs.''  UNUSUAL APPROACH  That is not the sort of talk one hears in  most medical schools. But then the M.S.U.  medical school, which was established as a  two-year school in 1964, expanded to four  years in 1970 and granted its first M.D. in  1972, does not do many things the way they  are done at most other medical schools.  Its combination of curricular and admin istrative  innovations and  its emphasis on  turning out doctors who can deal with the  broad range of human personalities and feel ings as well as the ""nonmedical"" factors af fecting health is becoming a model for other  schools.  Nearly a score of new or expanding medical  schools have emulated a number of M.S.U.'s  programs and,  in a  few cases, have hired  away facUlty and administrative personnel  instrumental in the innovations.  In the typical medical school the emphasis  in  the  first  two  years,  the  ""pre-clinical""  phase,  is on rapidly accumUlating  lots of  scientific  facts  through  formal courses  in  biochemistry, microbiology, pathology, phar macology, physiology and anatomy, as one  M.S.U. doctor put it, ""establishing one long  intimate relationship with a cadaver.""  June 15, 1976  It is commonly accepted among doctors  that much of  the material  traditionally  taught in the first two years of medical school  is not relevant to day-to-day medical prac tice and is soon forgotten by many doctors.  FRONT LINES OF MEDICINE  Whereas most medical students never have  contact with a real patient until their third  year and then only in a massive, academical ly oriented university hospital, M.S.U. stu dents  interview patients and take medical  histories in their first year and they do it in  clinics, community hospitals and doctors' of fices-the front lines of medicine.  Instead  of  formal  classes  proceeding  through  the basic  sciences, about half of  M.S.U.'s students opt for an informal system  using groups of eight to ten beginning stu dents, and advanced medical student, a be havioral scientist, a biological scientist and  a physician preceptor.  Unlike most medical schools, M.S.U. ac cepts only about half its students from the  typical  pre-med  undergraduate  programs.  The other half are older men and women with  experience in other fields.  In one group of 10,  for example,  there  were five students directly out of college, a  woman with a master's degree in social work  who had headed a large drug abuse program,  a pharmacist with four years experience, a  Ph.D. electrical engineer with 12 years in re search and teaching, a male nurse who work ed in a rural area, a nuclear engineer turned  environmental activist, and an ex-Marine.    Last fall's entering class was 38 percent  women and about one-quarter were black,  Spanish-speaking or Indian.  The groups meet as often and as long as  they choose to and take up a series of topic~;  and simulated cases.  ""At the beginning of this semester,"" said  Richard Sandler, a  first-year student, ""my  new small learning group assembled to brain storm how we might maximize our under standing and enjoyment of  the  topics at  hand-altered consciousness, muscle weak ness and lower back pain.""  The group came up with 15 activities, in cluding  asking various  specialists on  the  faculty and in the community to come in and  talk,  ""standing  in"" on surgery, attending  an autopsy, and learning from a physiother apist in addition to reading books.  ""At every moment,"" Mr. Sander said, ""we  would be asked,  'How would you approach  this?' or 'What would you tell the patient?'  We always had to keep in mind that we were  dealing with things that affect real people.""  There is also a library of videotape cassettes  on medical topics that students can view at  leisure on individual playback machines.  Although traditionalists have critized this  approach as too haphazard and as not con centrating strongly enough on the scientific  underpinnings of modern medicine, Michigan  State people say their way actually leads to  better retention of the relevant facts and to  the  inculcation of self-learning skills  that  will be useful after graduation in keeping up  with medical advances.  ""If you have a situation where it's fun to  learn,"" Mr._Sanders said, ""you keep on learn ing.""  RELATING TO THE PATIENT  A major emphasis throughout the M.S.U.  program is on relating  to the patient in a  sensitive and comfortable way that elicits the  most useful information they can give the  doctor while establishing a basis of trust and  support. For example, the problems of sex and  dying should be handled as easily as are vag inal diseases and cancer symptoms.  Just ten weeks into the first year, students  begin practicing their interviewing and his tory-taking skills on actors trained to sim ulate typical medical problems. These sessions  are videotaped and played back to the stu dent and a teacher who evaluate the methods  used. Later in the same year, the students  do much the same with real patients.  ",1976
197,,94,-0.168,599,15,Mr. MAHON.," Madam Speaker, I would like  to say as one of the conferees and as chair man of  the Committee on Appropriations  that I am unalterably opposed to giving away  the vital interests of the United States in  the Panama Canal.  When I  say, ""the vital interests,"" I mean  the possession and the present privileges and  the property and ownership which we enjoy  there.  I believe that probably 90 percent of the  Members of this House agree that we are op posed to giving away the Panama Canal, as  we call  it. We are in favor of maintaining  our rights and our prerogatives and the in tegrity of the United States in the Panama  Canal and in the Panama Canal Zone.  I cannot help it if the State Department  has a contorted meaning of the term, ""vital  interests."" I repudiate such an interpretation.  ""Vital interests,"" insofar as this conference  report is concerned, means to me the prop erty, the title, the possession, and the rights  of the United States in the Panama Canal  Zone. We cannot be responsible for the kind  of treaty that State Department employees  or others may propose. That is the constitu tional prerogative of the Executive, and it is  up to the Congress to approve or disapprove.  But I think it ought to be clear to the whole  wide world that the overwhelming majority  of the Members of this House are against  giving up the Panama Canal Zone. I appre ciate the statement of my friend from Ken tucky and his desire  to make plain to all  the attitude of the House on this important  matter.  VALENTYN MOROZ RENOUNCES  SOVIET CITIZENSHIP  HON.

Mr. Moroz has now appealed to the  U.S. Congress  to grant him political  asylum here. His renunciation of Soviet  citizenship may  place  hlrn  in  even  greater danger than that which he has  been experiencing, because through this  action he may have given up what rights  he may have as a Soviet citizen.  I  urge  the  International Relations  Committee to act as quickly as possible  which Representative KocH and I and  nearly 100 other Members of the House  on House Concurrent Resolution  588  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  have introduced. That resolution would  put Congress on record as supporting  Mr. Moroz in his present most difficult  situation and would be of great help to  him at this moment.  THE BALTIC STATES MUST BE  REMEMBERED  HON. JAMES J. BLANCHARD  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 15, 1976  ",1976
199,,94,-0.352,599,15,Mr. BLANCHARD.," Mr. Speaker, yes terday and today mark the 35th anni versary of the mass arrest and deporta tion of  thousands of people from  the  Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia, and  Estonia to Siberia by the Soviet Union.  In commemoration of that tragic event,  today has been designated  as Baltic  States Freedom Day.  It is essential, Mr. Speaker, that we  continue to remember  the wrong that  has been done to the peoples of these na tions and to bring it to the attention of  the world.  One day, the Baltic States will again  be free.  Until then, their plight should remind  us all of the oppression and bitterness  which remain in the world today, and of  the priceless value of the freedoms we  enjoy.  At  the  request of  the Joint Baltic  American Committee, I would like to take  this opportunity to insert in the RECORD  the following description of the events  of June 14-16, 1941:  THmTY-FIFTH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  THE  DE PORATION OF BALTIC PEOPLES TO SmERIA  This year, about one million Americans of  Baltic descent are commemorating the 35th  anniversary of the mass deportations of Lith uanians, Latvians, and Estonians to Siberia  which took place on June 14-15, 1941. Dur ing these first arrests, 100,000 persons were  deported to various places in Asian Siberia.  This was done to subdue the Baltic States,  which had been illegally occupied by the So viet Union against the will of the people.  The Soviet government began planning for  mass extermination of the Baltic people soon  after the conclusion of the Hitler-Stalin pact  of 1939. The clear evidence of this is found in  N.K.V.D. Order number 001223 regarding the  ""deportation of anti-Soviet elements  from  Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia."" According  to data collected by  the Lithuanian Red  Cross,  34,2fi'J persons were deported  from  Lithuania, 35,102  from Latvia, and 33,500  from Estonia.  Statistics on age groups and professions  have also been provided from a list of 20,974  persons. There were 1,626 infants; 2,165 chil dren from the ages of 4 to 10; 2,587 persons  from the ages of 10 to 18; 3,986 from the ages  of 18 to 30 years; 7, 778 persons from the ages  of 30 to 50; 1,681 from 50 to 70 years; 427 over  70 years of age; and the remainder of unde termined age.  The largest groups were elementary and  secondary school students: 6,378. There were  3,389 farmers, 1,865 housewives, 1,591 govern ment employees, 1,098 teachers, 879 workers,  622 servicemen, and 416 university students.  All  of  these  people were  loaded  into  freight cars with fifty  to sixty persons in  each car. The windows of  the cars were  boarded  over,  husbands  separated  from  wives, and children separated from parents.  18437  They all were locked in the cars lacking air,  food, and water.  The long journey from the Baltic states  to Siberia killed many weak and sick. Some  dead children were thrown out of the cars  by guards and left by the railroad, disregard ing the enormous grief of their mothers.  In the  following years, many other de portations took place. Baltic deportees were  to northern Russia; western  transported  and eastern Siberia, and Kazakhstan. They  were used for slave labor and many of them  perished in the mines and forests, or they  were annihilated by  the cold,  the starva tion, and diseases because they lacked proper  clothing, food, and medical attention.  Some managed  to  survive. A  few  even  reached the United States, and readily testi fied to the inhuman conditions of life and  to the cruelty of their imprisonment. Even  Alexander Solzhenitsyn in his book ""Gulag  Archipelago"" witnessed how Baltic deportees  were tortured and forced to live under in human conditions.  Four young Lithuanian girls, who were  deported to Siberia, have secretly written a  prayerbook, which  through  underground  channels, has been smuggled to the western  world.  It was published  in English,  and  titled: ""Mary Save Us.""  These young girls wrote:  ""The day has  closed its eyes. Fatigue closes my eyes. My  feelings have dried up, my strength has left  me .    . with icy lips, with tear-filled eyes,  tormented by despair, we fly to your straw covered crib, o Holy Babe ... We are drained  of strength, our feelings have faded away,  our hearts are benumbed thoughts we can not control ... Jesus help those who die in  fo:~<eign Lands without consolation of  the  Chttrch or their dear ones, without the com fort and aid of their friends.""  The Soviet Union  also deported people  from the Baltic States in following years. A  Lithuanian woman, Barbara Armonas, was  deported  in May of 1948, but after many  years of slavery, she managed to emigrate  to the USA. She describes her deportation  from Lithuania in her book:  ""Leave your  tears in Moscow"".  ""About  four o'clock in  the morning of  May 22nd  (1948), I heard a knock on my  door .  .  . I opened the door and froze with  fear ... There was a whole detachment of  soldiers, about  thirty altogether,  all with  heavy weapons. In the yard, a machine gun  had been set up. The officer pushed me aside,  went  into  the house, and demanded my  passport ... He took a letter from his pocket  and read  in a. monotonous voice that the  state had decided to deport me from Lithu ania to other Soviet states ... I had only a  half hour to prepare myself for the deporta tion  journey. Awakened by the noise, my  son started to cry ... I was told that I could  take no suitcases, but must pack everything  into a potato sack ...  ""When the half hour was up, my son, my self, and our belongings were put  into a  buggy and escorted under heavy guard  to  the neighboring village .... Some  twenty five  families had been  collected.  .  . Each  family sat on their sacks in a group. No one  talked.  ""Some two hundred families had been col lected and put into trucks, each guarded by  fo~ Russian  soldiers with  guns.  These  trucks were nearly all American Lend-Lease  equipment ... At first, I thought all Lithu anians were being deported .  .  . The village  of Aukstuoliai was left completely empty.  ""At the railroad station, we were put into  cattle cars, about forty to sixty people to a  car. The train stood in the station at Pane vezys for  two full days. We were given no  food  .  .  . Our transport consisted of sixty  cars, so it can be estimated that it contained  about 2,400 persons ... The feelings of human  beings herded into cattle cars are impossible  to describe. No one knew where we were go ing or what could be expected .... In one car,  ",1976
200,,94,-0.414,612,15,Mr. MEZVINSKY.," Mr. Speaker,  the  future of locks and dam 26, which Con gress will decide, will affect the future of  the Mississippi River, the economy, the  environment and the transportation sys tem of  the Midwest and  the Nation.  Whether this vital river facility should  be  rehabilitated,  replaced and/or en larged is a question which presents us  with a complex, multifaceted issue in volving conflicting data, competing in terests, charges and countercharges.  As we approach a  decision on  this  matter-hearings  in  the Senate will  begin this week-we can all benefit from  a responsible and lucid presentation of  the  issues  involved. The Des Moines  Register is at work to bring the facts to  light.  This Sunday, George Anthan of the  Register's Washington bureau addressed  one of the many issues in dispute in the  controversy surrounding locks and dam  26: The capacity of the existing facility.  I commend Mr. Anthan's article to my  colleagues and ask that it be reprinted:  CAN ALTON'S LOCK 26 HANDLE THE LOAD?  (By George Anthan)  ALTON, rLL.-Fifteen barges of the farmer  co-operative-owned Agri-Trans Corp.  nose  around a bend in the Mississippi River north  of St. Louis and move slowly toward an im posing concrete and steel structure display ing the familiar red castle of the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers.  The barges, pushed by a powerful boat,  nudge into Lock No. 26, lashed together in  what has become a fairly standard arrange ment for  the big Mississippi River  tows three barges across and five deep, with the  power boat pushing.  Only nine of the 15 Agri-Trans barges will  fit into the 600-foot-long Lock 26, so deck  hands set about loosening the heavy cables  that  lash  the barges  together. This  takes  about 10 minutes. Then the power boat backs  out of  the  lock,  taking with  it  the  six  barges that won't fit.  The lock gates are closed, and the cham ber  is  filled with water,  the nine barges  being  lifted  to  the  level of  the upstream  pool of the river. The upstream gates are  opened and the nine barges are slowly pulled  out by a waiting switch boat (Corps officials  say a much slower winching system usually  is employed to remove the unpowered barge  segments).  Then, the lock is emptied, the power boat  with  its  remaining six Agri-Trans barges  re-enters  the  facility, and  the process  is  repeated.  It takes about an hour and 40 minutes  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to complete the whole maneuver. Corps rec ords indicate that this process can take as  long as two hours and 15 minutes.  Using this method, the practical physical  capacity of Lock 26-about 53 million tons  o.f cargo moved through it a year-has been  reached.  The Corps,  the barge  industry, shippers  and a wide range of state and local govern ment agencies say the locks thus are inade quate, that they're a bottleneck costing mil lions of dollars a year in shipping delays and  extra operating expenses for tow equipment,  and that they should be replaced by a larger  structure at a cost of $400 million.  But some transportation experts contend  the locks have much unused capacity and  that these facilities and others like them on  the Mississippi are being operated by  the  Corps of Engineers in a way that's inefficient  and costly, but convenient for the barge and  shipping industry. Also, the way the present  lock is operated tends to buttress the argu ment that it must be replaced, these people  say.  The river lock at Alton is at a strategic  location. Through it passes all traffic to and  from the upper-Mississippi River area,  in cluding Iowa and Minnesota. Also, the lock  at Alton is just below the place where the  Illinois waterway enters the Mississippi, so  all traffic to and from this industrially im portant transportation link also must pass  through the facilities.  The controversy over replacement of Lock  and Dam 26 is becoming one of the biggest  in the Midwest in recent years. It involves  charges that failure to modernize the river  system could doom to stagnation the economy  of the entire region.  It involves the concerns of environmental ists and of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  over the future of the Mississippi as a multi purpose river.  It involves, also, the future of many Mid western  and Western  railroads,  some  of  which are slipping into bankruptcy.  Lock 26 has become the symbol for a con tinued federal commitment to the cheap river  transportation on which entire  industries  depend. Allowing this system to fall into dis repair, it is argued, is just as wrong as the  policies that allowed the railroads to deterio rate.  Although the 38-year-old  lock is in dis repair, the Corps of Engineers says the struc ture is not in danger of collapsing. Corps  officials in St. Louis say the lock and dam  can be rehabilitated. But they say the cost  would be almost as high as building a new  facility. This estimate is seriously disputed  by opponents and by some  transportation  officials in Washington.  An important question in the dispute  is  whether the present lock creates such a seri ous bottleneck on the river that its replace ment as soon as possible is warranted.  Is it necessary, ask opponents among the  railroads, environmentalists and some mem bers of Congress, for the public to spend $400  million so that the barge industry can more  conveniently and cheaply move  its equip ment?  ""That's what  it  really boils  down  to,""  acknowledges  James Lightsey,  director  of  river transportation for the Iowa Department  of Transportation, a  strong backer of  the  proposed new lock. ""The whole system does a  favor to the tow boats.""  The questions over capacity of the existing  lock will be the first aspect of this multi faceted issue to be examined by The Register.  Subsequently, The Register will publish  articles dealing with the physical condition  of the existing facility; with the relationship  between the Corps of Engineers and the river  transportation industry; with the methods  used by the Corps to justify financially the  June 15, 1976  construction of new facilities, and with the  squabble over whether the Corps intends a  new lock at Alton to be just the beginning  of a chain of such projects on the Upper  Mississippi.  PAY NOTHING  Operators of the 15 Agri-Trans barges that  were moved upstream through the lock paid  nothing to the Corps of Engineers for this  service. Barge operators pay nothing to cover  the costs related to the lock and dam systems  on the inland waterways-the maintenance  of the structures themselves, the expense of  constant dredging to keep the river channel  deep enough, the salaries of the federal em ployes who operate the facilities.  These costs are borne by the general pub lic. Questions involving this policy also will  be explored later.  Joseph Carroll, professor of business ad ministration and head of the Pennsylvania  University Transportation Institute, is a na tionally recognized expert on public invest ment in transportation facilities.  In the past, he has worked for the Corps of  Engineers. He's now serving as a consultant  to the Western Railroad Association, which  is fighting the plan to replace Lock and Dam  26.  ""What the Corps is trying to do,"" Carroll  said in an interview in Chicago recently, ""is  to minimize the costs to the barge people.  These are the people who are the constit uency of the Corps.""  In a 1974 study presented to the Society of  Naval Architects, Carroll and an associate  said that one reason the river locks are con gested is the ""absense of any mechanism for  ensuring that (barge) operators take into ac count  the  impact of  their  actions upon  others.""  The study continued: ""It might be said  that lock capacity, an increasingly scarce re source, is being used frivolously. Too much of  it is devoted to accommodating oversized or  underpowered tows and empty barges.""  If the Agri-Trans  tow had  approached  Lock 26 ""ready to serve""-a maximum of  eight barges plus the power boat-the oper ation would have taken about 35 minutes  according to personnel at the lock.    This would be the ideal configuration for  Lock 26 and would permit its use to maxi mum capacity. With this system according  to internal Corps studies, up  to 32 barges  could be moved through the lock in the same  time that a single 15-barge tow now is being  served.  Higher Costs  But in order to use Lock 26 this way, the  barge industry would have to buy many new  tow boats and  the tows would be smaller.  Labor costs would  increase because more  deck hands and pilots would be needed. The  barge industry's rates could be forced up and  its competitors, the railroads, might siphon  off some of the traffic.  There  is  little question  that delays at  Alton, which now are causing a rising chorus  of complaints, will increase.  But the Corps of Engineers has detailed  reports by private  consultants who have  employed sophisticated computer techniques  to show that the lock here could handle at  least 76 million tons of traffic each year, and  possibly as much as 93 million tons.  To reach this level, the tows would have  to arrive at the lock ready to serve, to move  through in what is called a single lockage.  Thus, if the barge industry and river ship pers were to conform their tows to the lock  here at Alton, the existing facility could be  expected to handle cargo  levels that some  U.S. Department of Transportation  (DOT)  experts say may not be required until almost  the turn of the century. And any excess then  could easily be moved by rail, they say.  ",1976
201,,94,-0.332,625,15,Mr. NOWAK.," Mr. Speaker,  in this  era of media networks, syndicates and  chains, my home town of Bu:ffalo, N.Y ..  is indeed fortunate 1n having two in ne spaper.s.  dependently owned,  competitive daily  18463  One of these is a morning paper, the  Buffalo Courier-Express, which 1s  rep resented here  in Washington by Mr.  Peter C. Andrews.  The Courier-Express this week marked  the 50th anniversary of its formation via  a merger of the former Buffalo Courier  and the Buffalo Express in 1926.  During  this past half-century,  the  Courier-Express has been an important  institution  in  the western New York  community.  I would  like  to  join the  many thousands of well wishers in our  area in e::!q)ressing  the hope  that the  Courier-Express  continues  to  flourish  during its second half-century.  At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, I  insert  in the RECORD the following article which  appeared in the June 14, 1976 editions of  the Buffalo Courier-Express:  CoURIER-ExPRESS 50 TODAY, Two NEWSPAPERS  MERGED 'IN 1926 TO BETTER SERVE Ptrnu:c  Fifty years ago today, the Buffalo Courier  and the Buffalo Express ushered in ""a new  era in morning newspaper history"" with their  merger to form The Courier-Express.  The Courier-Express thus begiru; with this  edition its 51st year of service to the com m""llnity and advertiSers.  A  front-page  photograph  in  the  iirst  Courier-Express on June 14,  1926  showed  former Express President and Editor Burrows  Matthews and former Courier Publisher Wil liam J. Conners Jr. looking out from a mas sive printing press. One reporter from each  paper  in side-by-side  stories  told of  the  ""Birth and Rise of Two Dallies to Planes of  Power, Climaxing  in Merger, Romance of  Business,"" as  the  joint headline read.  Willlam J. Conners was owner and presi dent of the Courier.  Mr. Matthews became president and editor  of The Courier-Express with the merger. Mr.  Conners Jr. became publisher and vice-presi dent, while his father, William J. Conners,  became chairm.an of the board.  ""The merger  is  the  result of mutual  realization that by combining forces both  (newspapers)  can best serve  the public,''  read  The Courier-Express'  first  editorial  ""The  compelllng motive  of  any  journal  should be to serve the best interests of it:;:;  public.""  The announcement of the merger had been  made two days before, on June 12, 1926, in  nearly  identical  eight-column  headlines  across the front pages of both papers. The  only difference was  in the order that the  journals printed  thP.ir names. The Express  proclaimed,  ""Courier and Express Merge,''  while the Courier reversed the order, allow ing the Express first mention.  On the day both papers announced the  merger the morning Courier devoted a six column headline story of a Sparta, N.J., man  who  ""Shoots Wife, Mother  in Law, Then  Flees."" The Express  featured details of a  U.S. Senate  investigation of a $1.4 million  slush fund  in Pennsylvania state politics  and the tale of an American freed from a  Mexican bandit who had held him for ran som.  The Courier-Express  represents  the olr spring of 12 separate newspapers. Its exist ence as a dally traces back to the Western  Star, which began publication on July 21,  1834. The Star became the Buffalo Republi can in 1839, and the Mercantile Courier &  Democratic Economist in 1842. Ultimately,  the Courier absorbed  the Economist, and  then the National Pilot, formerly the Buffalo  Gazette in 1846.  One of the most important transactions in  the Courier's long history came in May 1867,  when William J. Conners, a Buffalo water front labor contractor bought 1t and merged  1t with his Morning Record. The result was   ",1976
202,Senate,94,0.135,716,15,Mr. PACKWOOD.," Granted,  the  re quest has been made. I am tired, as a  member of the Finance Committee, of  being accused of fraud by Members of  the Senate, who referred to this bill as  fraud, violating the letter and spirit of  the Budget Committee, and we did not  send this out of committee with a fraud ulent feeling. I do not want to sit here for  6 hours tomorrow and be beaten over the  If the majority  Mr.  if  the Senator  head about fraudulent experience,  the  spirit of the Budget Committee, and then  get to debate and find we have complied  with what they said.  ",1976
203,House,94,0.241,794,15,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. Speaker, as rank ing minority member of the Veterans'  Affairs Subcommittee on Housing, I rise  in reluctant support of  this proposed  legislation as it is currently written. As  cosponsor of the House passed bill, H.R.  13724, and as a sponsor of two of the  major provisions in this bill, the increase  in the direct  loan maximum and  the  continuation of the direct loan revolving  fund, I am in agreement with all but one  of the Senate changes in our version.  Section 8 of S. 2529 provides for the  preemption of State constitutional usu ry provisions which limit the  interest  rates chargeable on FHA/VA mortgages  by a certain type of lenders while not  imposing rate limits on mortgages made  by other lenders. According to the Sen ate report, only California is presently  affected by this section. Currently the  California State constitution has a 10percent usury ceiling; however, banks,  savings and loans, and other commercial  lenders  are  exempt  from  this usury  limit. However,  the mortgage banking  industry which  came  into popularity  with FiiA!VA loans after the constitu tional exemptions became effective,  is  not exempt from the 10-percent usury  limit. Therefore, since mortgage bank ers do a  large share of the originating  of Veterans' Administration home loans,  I  can understand  the desire  to  get  around this 10-percent usury limit. De cause as the interest rates approach 10  percent, the mortgage bankers are un able to close FHA/VA loans.  Since  this is  a State constitutional  matter, however, it would seem that the  proper manner to rectify this probl~m  would be for California  to change ~ts  State constitution. It is my understand ing that an effort to make such a change  in the California constitution failed in  1970. In essence, therefore, since a ma jority  of Californians  voted  against  changing the constitution, the U.S. Con gress is stepping into a State matter and  circumventing the will of the people of  California. With the outcry for less Fed eral interference in local matters, sec tion 8 of this bill seems contrary to gen eral desire for less Federal intervention.  realize however, that it is sometimes  difficult to' change State constitutions, as  rhetoric often clouds the true issues in volved and I know that the California  state Legislature has petitioned the U.S.  congress for such an exemption. I also  realize  that section 8 contains a pro vision allowing California, or any other  state which may be later affected,  to  I  override this Federal edict by taking the  appropriate action on  the State  level  to reinstate the usury limits.  Although  this makes section 8 more  palatable, I would hope that California  would in the near future try again to  resolve  this problem so that this pro vision which is geared especially for Cali fornia could be later deleted from  the  United States Code. The gentleman from  California (Mr. EDWARDs), an able mem ber of our Housing Subcommittee,  is  rightfully concerned that if interest rates  again rise to near 10 percent, many Cali fornia veterans may be precluded from  utilizing  the Veterans' Administration  home loan program. I share that con cern and only hope that California on its  own can resolve this problem in the near  future. Although I understand that it  is remotely possible to interpret this sec tion to pertain to states other than Cali fornia,  it  is clearly  the congressional  intent to presently affect only California.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, :i: strongly  endorse the other provisions of this bill  as it will continue the direct loan pro gram and raise the direct loan ceiling to  a reasonable amount of $33,000. This will  enable veterans in rural areas the same  opportunity to purchase adequate hous ing as veterans in urbau areas. With the  increase in guaranty from 30 to 50 per cent for mobile homes, it also will, hope fully,  add  vitality  to  the Veterans'  Administration mobile home loan pro gram, thus enabling our young Vietnam  veteran the opportunity to obtain hous ing which is within his budget. This bill  will also make permanent the Veterans'  Administration home loan program. In  their  statement before  the Veterans'  Affairs  Housing  Subcommittee  on  July 30, 1975, the VA stated they would  have no objection if Congress decided t,o  continue the VA loan guaranty program  for post-Vietnam-era veterans. On Sep tember 10, 1975, the Housing Subcom mittee recommended that the VA home  loan program be made permanent. That  recommendation was contained in H.R.  9576 which passed this body on October 6,  1975.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, although  I  do have reservations about section 8, I  would not want to deny veterans in Cali fornia the opportunity to utilize the VA  home loan program, nor would I want  to deny any of our deserving veterans  the needed changes contained  in  this  bill. Thus, I urge that we unanimously  pass  this proposed legislation in order  that it can be sent to the White House  for signature before expiration of  the  direct  loan  revolving  fund which  is  scheduled to revert to the U.S. Treasury  on June 30, 1976.  Mr. Speaker, I applaud all those whose  efforts have made this bill possible and  hope that it will give more of out Nation's  deserving veterans the opportunity they  need to house their families.

Gen. Arthur St. Clair was a Con tinental Army Officer, a President of the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Continental Congress, the first Governor  of the Northwest Territory, a comman dant of West Point, and a commandant  of Fort Ligonier. He was a military hero  at Trenton and Princeton at the begin ning of the Revolution and his maneuvers  at Saratoga led to the defeat of General  Burgoyne of the British Army, a  turn ing point in the Revolution. It was Maj.  Gen. St. Clair who was chosen among  all others to deliver the address at George  Washington's funeral.  He left a successful career as surveyor  for the Penn family, justice of the peace,  judge of the probate court, recorder of  deeds and general law enforcement offi cer so that he could serve in the Conti nental Army. It was out of such a self sacrificing  and  dedicated  spirit  that  America was born.  The existing  inscription above Maj.  Gen. St. Clair's grave reads-The  earthly  remains of Major General  Arthur St. Clair are deposited beneath this  humble monument which is erected to sup ply the place of a nobler one due from his  country. He died August 31, 1818 in the 84th  year of his age.  It is clear to me that a more perma nent memorial was  intended  for  this  man. What more fitting  tribute could  thus be paid than a permanent monu ment of memory in the form of a resolu tion by the people's House of the Govern ment of the country that he gave his life  and riches to create? I think that in this  Bicentennial year it would be particu larly appropriate to finally dedicate such  a ""monument of memory"" to this great  American.  ENEMIES OF THE  INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY  CONTINUE  THEm  ATTACKS  HON. LARRY McDONALD  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, June 16, 1976  Mr. McDONALD. Mr. Speaker,  the  Organizing Committee for a Fifth Estate,  publishers of the magazine Counterspy,  has recently released the latest issue of  their magazine. As  I have pointed out  previously,  the function of OC-5 and  Counterspy is  to serve the Soviet and  Cuban Communist intelligence services  by attacking the American intelligence  community. Former CIA Director, Wil liam Colby, has accused OC-5 of being in  large part responsible for the murder of  Richard Welch, the CIA station chief in  Athens, Greece.  The latest issue of Counterspy, dated  spring 1976, carries a full page of names  of alleged CIA agents  in Africa. The  names had been provided by the left wing Paris newspaper, Liberacion, and  by the Slack Panther Party.  Another full page of names were al leged to be CIA agents in London. This  list which included U.S. Embassy staff  members,  including young  secrets.ries,  revealed the home addresses of the in tended victims. The London list had been  provided by  the International Marxist  June 16, 1976  to  Group in England, the British section of  the Trotskyite terrorist Fourth Interna tional. The leader of the IMG, Tariq Ali,  is also a member of the International Ex ecutive Committee of the Fourth Inter national. According  the  Socialist  Workers Party, Tariq Ali has publicly  taken a position, ""very favorable to the  use of terrorism.""  The Socialist Workers Party  is  the  American section of the Fourth Inter national. The SWP has also revealed that  their British comrades in the IMG have  been the major support for a  terrorist  group called Saor Eire which has com mitted murders and done bombings in  both England and Ireland. The-collab oration of OC-5 with such people in iden tifying alleged CIA agents is tantamount  to setting up assassinations.  The same issue of Counterspy also car ried an attack on this Member of Con gress.  I became  the subject because a  member of my staff is married to a man  who publishes a newsletter called Infor mation Digest which OC-5 finds objec tionable. Counterspy refers to John Rees  and his wife, Louise, who is employed on  my staff as ""extremely dangerous peo ple."" Is this another invitation for physi cal attack by the violence prone leftwing?  Much of  the Counterspy article  in cluding large sections which are inac cura ~ or completely confused, were sup plied by William Haddad, an employee  of the New York State Assembly speaker,  Stanley Steingut. I have previously dis cussed the peculiar career of Haddad who  has acted as a source for Jack Anderson  for many years.  I would like to call to the attention of  my colleagues  testimony which  gave  before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on  Internal Security on March 26, 1976. The  testimony concerns the Organizing Com mittee for a Fifth Estate. It appears un der the title Subversion of Law Enforce ment Intelligence Gathering Operajtions,  part I.

211,,94,-0.171,924,15,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker, I  in clude my Washington Report entitled,  ""The Hays Affair"":  THE HAYS AFFAm  If the Wayne Hays affair prompts the U.S.  Congress  to investigate itself to determine  whether its members are abusing the pre rogatives of high office, it could be one of the  better things that has ever happened to the  Congress.

212,,94,0.739,937,15,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, at a  time  when the national debt is at an alltime  high, when that debt is fueling a serious  problem of inflation and resulting unem ployment and recession, it is irresponsible  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  to consider expanding the debt limit. To  expand the debt limit would simply be to  increase that inflation, unemployment,  and recession. It would be a stab in the  back to the economic recovery which ap pears now to be beginning.  In testimony before the House Com mittee on Ways and Means, Alan W.  Bock, director of  the Libertarian Ad vocate, asked some very important ques tions.  Mr. Bock asked:  How much  longer can  the conventional  wisdom sustain this Government? How much  longer can you keep  spending far beyond  what the people of this country are remotely  willing to pay, and pretend that it is all for  the benefit of those same people? How much  longer can you keep  the printing presses  running,  cranking  out  fiat money  and  destroying the value of hard-earned money  before the citizens revolt and say, ""No more.  We're not paying any more.""  Mr. Bock, in his testimony, urged the  defeat of the request for an increase in  the national debt limit and asked the  Gove!Il.IXlent to ""face the same problem  an overextended private citizen faces.  and meet it honestly. To increase the  debt ceiling and print up more money  robs  every honest  citizen. The  cycle  should be stopped now.""  In his testimony, Mr. Bock calls for a  form of modem accrual accounting for  the Federal Government. Such a step 1s  essential to make sense of Federal spend ing and in this connection I have intro duced legislation to implement accrual  accounting which would provide for truth  in Government accounting procedures.  This legislation now has 116 cosponsors.  In addition, Treasury Secretary Wil liam Simon has announced that his De partment plans to implement accrual ac counting throughout the Federal Gov ernment in early 1978. This will accom plish two major goals: it will clarify the  cwnulated long-term debts of the Federal  Government, such as social security and  it will present the Federal Gove~ent's  financial situation in a much more ac curate light. In the private sector, proper  accounting controls and sound financial  reporting on an accrual basis are pre requisites to fiscal responsibility and an  accurate understanding of a unit's fi nancial condition. Accrual accounting in  the Federal Government will provide  similar controls over governmental af fairs and financial reporting.  The one point in Mr. Bock's testimony  with which I disagree is his recommenda tion that the U.S. Government should  repudiate its past debts. To do so, would  harm  countless  innocent citizens and  would eliminate the respect which a gov ernment must have if it is to govern.  Nevertheless, it does seem clear that now  is  the time to call a halt  to debt in creases. Let us slowly pay the debt which  exists at this time and then resolve to  put our government on a pay-as-you-go  basis. Only by pursuing this course can  economic health be restored.  I wish  to share with my colleagues  the testimony of Alan W. Bock, director  of the Libertarian Alternative, as it was  presented before the House Committee  on Ways and Mea:ns on June 1, 1976, and  insert it into the RECORD at this time:  18775  STATEMENT OF ALAN W. BOCK  Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee,  ladies and gentlemen. I am Alan Bock, Di rector of Libertarian Advocate, an action and  lobbying organization  formed  to promote  individual human Uberty and to seek legis lative avenues to maximize freedom for all  Americans.  Well, here we are again, with the ever more-frequent request to raise the legal ceil ing on the National Debt--again. What used  to occur every few years now happens every  few months as Congress and its government  continue spending money they are afraid to  extract from the people directly.  This  time  the precise  timing  is strictly  poll tical. When this Committee last raised  the  ce111ng  in February, you  could have  boosted it enough to last through September  or even November. But the  figure needed  might have been too high-who would have  wanted to acknowledge a public debt as high  as $645 billion right in the middle of a cam paign? So you took the lower figure-around  $630 billlon-to get you through June.  Yes, now 1s the time to do it. Almost all  the primaries are over. There will be a  lull,  and then the conventions will be upon us  like a plague of locusts. You can pretty well  count on the voters' attention being focused  on the Presidential battles, which have be come interesting in both major parties. You  can be fairly sure that a new debt ceiling  passed now, high enough to get you past the  November elections, w1ll have slipped out of  the voters' consciousness in the hullaballoo  of the coming months. Only a few cranks will  work up enough indignation to threaten any body's reelection.  Far be it from a libertarian to lack a real istic cynicism about politicians. There's not  much I can do about it except to congratu late you on your ablllty to operate within the  traditional bounds of what the conventional  wisdom considers political pragmatism.  I wonder how much longer the conven tional wisdom wUI be enough  to sustain  you. The political tide seems to be rolling  in an anti-Washington direction this spring.  You may be shrewd to raise the national debt  ce111ng during a political lull. But raising  the ceiling should certainly give more am munition  to  the anti-Washington candi dates-as well as contributing to the further  alienation of  those, now almost always a  majority, who indicate their respect for the  political system by staying home on election  day.  How much  longer can  the conventional  wisdom sustain this government? How much  longer can you keep spending far beyond  what  the people of  this country are  re motely willing to pay, and pretend that it  is all for the benefit of those same people?  How much longer can you keep the printing  presses running, cranking out flat money and  destroying the value of hard-earned money  before the citizens revolt and say, ""No more.  We're not paying any more."" The best-kept  secret in the country is  the magnitude o!  the tax revolt, the massive numbers of peo ple who just aren't paying any more. How  long before those legions become so numer ous that the government has to creak to a  painful stop?  I don't know,  for sure, but  surely  the  irresponsibllity which this gov ernment shows  in handling the money it  takes from its citizens can't go on forever.  Someday the reckoning must come.  There is one bright side to the magnitude  of the national debt and the immense size  of the deficit. It blows to smithereens the  theory  that  there  is any demand by  the  people for more government. There  is one  objective way to measure how much govern ment the people want, and this is to figure  out how much government  they're willing  to pay for. The existence of a national debt  of more than $600 blllion, of a deficit hover ing around $80 billion, is an objective incH",1976
213,Senate,94,-0.567,950,15,Mr. NELSON.," Mr. President, on behalf  of myself and 14 other Senators, I am  proposing  a  package  of  tax  reform  amendments designed  to strengthen in  a number of important respects the Tax  Reform Act of 1976 as reported by the  Committee on Finance.  We believe that the Congress should  take a  bolder and firmer step  toward  meaningful tax reform at this time than  what has been  recommended by  the  committee. Five of us who are sponsor package  of  strengthening  amendments are members of the Finance  Committee, Senators HARTKE, MONDALE,  this  ing  HATHAWAY, HASKELL, and myself. We be in its  lieve that much of the voluminous work  accomplished by  the committee  consideration of the Tax Reform Act over  the past few months  is valuable and  should be enacted.  But the general posture of the Finance  Committee bill on tax reform  is weak  and  inadequate. The bill suffers  from  serious deficiencies.  It does not achieve adequate tax re form.  It does not raise the modest $2 billion  revenue needed to meet the Budget Com mittee recommendation for ftscal1977.  As a direct result of these failures, the  bill would actually raise taxes on nearly  every taxpaying family and single per son in the country in the middle of 1977,  and would deprive elderly taxpayers of  needed tax relief for another year.  And finally,  in every future year the  committee's tax  reforms will  actually  lose more revenues than they gain.  Overall, the committee bill is too weak  in trimming back on existing tax privi leges and special tax benefits, and too  vigorous  in opening up a host of new  special interest tax breaks. Many of these  new  tax breaks  in  the committee bill  would primarily benefit  the wealthiest  taxpayers in the country, as many exist ing loopholes do.  The committee bill takes away some  existing  tax  benefits  from  the  very  wealthy with one hand, and extends new  ones with  the other. On balance,  it  largely protects the economic interests  of the wealthiest few taxpayers. And it  does far too little to advance the interests  of the average taxpayer.  We recognize  that what we refer  to  as ""tax reform"" is enormously compli cated, intensely controversial and politi cally difficult. Conscientious people differ  over what is and what is not ""reform""  and how it should be achieved. Many of  us believe there should be a major over hauling of the whole tax structure, but  we recognize that to involve a long tough  fight. We believe that our proposals rep resent a significant step in the right di rection and, in our judgment, they rep resent about  the maximum achievable  at this time. If we prevail, we think it  will be a breakthrough that will pave the  way for further significant reforms in the  near future.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that at the conclusion of my state ment a  summary outline be printed in  the RECORD. It explains in detail the dif ferences between the House bill, the Sen ate bill, and the proposed amendment, as  well as attached statements endorsing  the package of proposals we have made.

220,,94,-0.247,1067,15,Mr. RANDOLPH.," Mr. President, this  is a year for America to celebrate its past  and  the greatness of  its accomplish ments. The Bicentennial also provides us  with a unique opportunity for addressing  those problems which face us today and,  by working together, to overcome them.  One of the problems that confronts us  every day is the carnage on our highways  which kills more than 45,000 Americans,  injures and disables many  times  that  number, and, at the same time, exacts a  tremendous cost in property damage.  lem?  What can be done to solve this ~robl  !  Sjgnjftcant steps have been made over  recent years to reduce these fearsome  statistics. During 1974, the :ft.rst full year of the nationwide 55 mlle-per-hour speed  limit. of which I was principal author  in  the Senate.  fatalities  dropped by  nearly 10,000. Perhaps more significant.  th1s figure remained stable in 1975, de spite the fact that more drivers and cars  were on the road and substantially more  overall miles were driven than in the  previous year.  However. to rest on such laurels, par ticularly during this special year, would  be dangerous and unwise. We are now  facing a huge increase in highway travel  in connection with the Bicentennial cele bration. All over the country, people are  planning trips to witness and participate  in America's 200 birthday-trips that will  take them across  town and across the  Nation. As a  result, the experts project  that 1976 will be the highest travel year  in our history.  And that poses a serious problem. It is  conceivable that, since injuries and fa talities on our roads are directly related  to the amount of miles driven, we could  see a significant increase this year in the  highway slaughter. In fact, the death toll  for this past April reflects just that.  The Senate has called attention to the  need for emphasis on highway safety by  its adoption yesterday of Hous-e Joint  Resolution 726, calling on the President  to omcially proclaim the National Bicen tennial Highway Safety Year.  Last November 14,  I  introduced this  measure in the Senate as Senate Joint  Resolution 147. On the same day, my  colleague, Representative WILI.I.Uol H.  HARsHA of Ohio, introduced a companion  measure in the House of Representatives.  The House-passed version was amended  in committee  to provide that th.e Na tional Bicentennial Highwa-y Safety Year  would  omcially  begin  ""the  first  full  month following enactment ... In order to  expedite approval of th1s vital e1fort, I  urged the Judiciary Committee to act on  the House version. I appreciate th.e action  of that committee and its Subcommittee  on Federal Charters, Holidays and Cele brations, under the leadership of Senator  HRUSKA and Senator McCLELLAN, for ita  positive consideration of this measure.  What we have done by passage of th.e  resolution is lend congressional su::;>pon  to a program already underway-a pro gram that has already mobilized individ uals and organizations representing more  than 4 mlllion Americans in a concerted  grassroots effort to save lives  th.IS"" year  and in the years following.  Conceived and coordinated by citizens  for Highway Safety, a tax-exempt, non profit organization. the National Bicen tennial Highway Safety Year program  will each month focus on a  di1ferent  aspect of highway safety-such as high hazard identification and removal, chll dren,-s safety, safety belt usage, alcohol each of which promises significant life saving  potential.  Organizations  and  agencies, both public and private, inter ested individuals, groups, companies and  unions are sponsoring the monthly cam paigns.  ",1976
221,Senate,94,0.444,1080,15,Mr. TOWER.," Mr. President, in recent  months we have witnessed a sharp rise  in the tempo of debate on the vital issue  of our national security. Unfortunate ly, much of the public political debate on  this issue has been seriously misleading  to the American people.  In this  regard,  I was gratified,  re cently, to hear the voice of Gen. Fred C.  Weyand speak out on national defense.  General Weyand is a distinguished sol dier who has served the Army and the  Nation more  than  three decades. As  Chief of Sta:fi of the Army, he is emi nently qualified to speak on the subject  of the security of the United States.  At  the commencement ceremony at  Texas A. & M. on May a, General Weyand  delivered a stirring address on the abso lute necessity for military preparedness.  He emphasized that our inability to fore see the futme demands a constant state  of readiness in order to protect and de fend the United States in an uncertain  and imperfect world. He said:  This is the point that is of crucial im portance  today-that while  our military  forces are strong, if the trends of recen_t years  of cutting the de!ense budget continue, our  forces could decline to the point where they  will be in!erior to our potential adversaries.  . . . :r am grati:fi.ed that the Congress seems  to be taking heed to that message.  General Weyand's speech is an impor tant contribution to the dialog on nation al security. He clearly thinks, as I do,  that  the President's recommendations  will serve to reverse the dangerous trend  wrought by excessive defense cuts in re cent years. General Weyand's comments  corroborate what I have said before President Ford's actions  speak much  louder than the rhetoric of those who  seek his job.  heartily  recommend  to my  col leagues the remarks of General Weyand  at Texas A. & M. and ask unanimous con sent that his speech be printed in the .  I  R'ECORD.  There being no objection, the speech  was ordered to be printed in the REcORD,  as follows:  AnDRESS BY GEN. FRED C. WEYAND  Thank you, Dr. Williams, members of the  staff snd distinguished guests and graduating  studen_ts-my friends. As Dr. Williams said,  this is a memorable occasion for the Univer sity. I must say that it is very much so such  an occasion for me to come here and be with  all of you at this University that is known  throughout the world for the support that  it has given to the ideals and hopes of our  forefathers. But more meaningful and more  important than that is the work that it has  clone  to bring its ideals to reality. And for  me it is a very personal privilege and pleasure  to be here, because it satisfies a commitment  I made to myself some 23 years ago. Twenty three years ago a very dear and close friend  of mine was killed-an o11icer, a leader-his  name was Jack Richmond. We were lieuten a!lt colonels together in the Infantry . . Jack  was killed  in 1953. He was a  graduate of  Texas A&M, and in the aftermath of that  experience, I made a commitment that some day I would come home for him. And so to day I fulfill that commitment.  This is a meaningful year for all of us be cause in the Nation's Bicentennial year and  the University's Centennial year we tend to  do something that Americans don't often do:  look back. It is a healthy thing for us to  look back, assess where we have been, where  we are and where we are going. There are  many valuable lessons to be learned from the  past.  In preparing  to  talk  to you  I  reread a  speech  that General Omar Bradley made  to the graduating class here some 26 years  ago on the 2d of June 1950.  And  interestingly in that speech, General  Bradley did as you would expect-he paid  tribute to the more than 70,000 Texas A&M  students who  had  served  in  the Armed  Forc:es-20,000 of them in World War II of  which 14,000 were commissioned officers, 29  were generals and somehow or another one  admiral crept into that group; six had won  the Medal of Honor. More tha.n 700 of that  class of 1950 that General Bradley addl.'essed  were veterans. He paid tribu:t:.e to their serv ice and emphasized the importance of the  Reserve 01ficer Training Program.  In closing, as I suppose mo.st commence ment speakers do, he praised the spirit of  Texas-the spirit of independent action and  forthright courage that has marked Texans  all throughout  its history-and he quoted  from  tnat famous message sent from  the  Alamo on February 24c, 1836 by Colon_el Wil liam Barrett Travis.  Tha.t was a great speech General Bradley  gave then. Reading it today it is still a stir ring s-peech. But it was more important for  wh&t it clid not say than what it said be cause as it turned out, he, just as we, coUld  not predtct the future with certaintyc. Now  remember -a.t that time General Bradley was  like me-he was  a member o!  the  Joi.n.t  Chiefs o! Staff. But beyond tha-t he was the  Chairman ot the Join_t Chiefs of Staff and  thus _privy to all o! the mtelligen_.ce that this  country bad on world conditions.  Yet, as he stood here that day even he  could not know  tha.t within. 24 days  the  United states would be a.t waz a.nd that  inany of those sitting out in_ that audience  before him. would soon. be engaged in armed  combat in KoTea~  Now  suppose 1! anyone on  that June  day in Texas had told the graduating class  that before the montb was out the United  States would be at wa.r in Korea, they would  have thought that idea preposterous because  we all knew that Korea was outside of our  defense perimeter. It was the consensus of  that Korea was or no  our Government  strategic interest to the United States.. The  Secretary of State had even_ p.roclaimed that  publicly. Certainly: n_oth.ing could be more  sure than that the United States would not  become involved in any land war in Asia.  Yet, we did beoome involved in a bloody 3year war tba.t ultimately cost us over 33,000  American lives.  What is the lesson that we derived from  that? I would say at least one lesson is that  e en  the wisest of us cannot  foresee  the  fu.ture.  I  suppose  tha.t  is why one of the  precepts I have personally fostered as Chief  of Staff of the Army is that this Army of  ours must be prepared for the unexpected.  Well, if you cannot foresee the future, how  then do you provide for the security of the  United States? Our Founding Fathers' an swer to that problem is contained in Article  II of the Bill of Rights which they adopted  on December 15, 1791. In that provision. they  provided that ""A well regulated Militia., be ing necessary to the security of a free St.a.te,  the right of  the people to keep and bear  .Arms, shall not be infringed.""  In  those  early days  the United States  provided against unforeseen threats by havI  ing a capability to mobilize her citizenry to  be ready for the unexpected. In addition, the  Constitution  provided  a  small  standing  army. This was not easy for them because  they were opposed to standing armies. You  may recall that they fought a revolution to  do away with  oppression and particularly  with armed oppression. And  so  they did  argue in the aftermath of that revolution  whether or not they needed an army, or an  armed force, an_d it was Madison who argued  an_d debated the issue of ""why an Army.""  They decided not to make such a prohibition  ruld provision. in the Constitution, 'and they  concluded  tha.t since  they could not stop  other countries from having armies-those  other countries hostile to us-it would be  foolish to prohibit the United States from  having an army.  At  the same time they were suspicious of  armed force, and they wanted to make sure  that the United States Army and our armed  force remained a people's army .  .  . a serv ant, never a master, of the people; and so  they did write into the Constitution. a pro vision  to  insure  that. Alexander Hamilton  pointed out that the Constitution gave ""the  whole power of raifling armies to the legisla ture, not  to  the executive;, Additionally,  there was an important qualification in that  the appropriation o! money for support of  the Army could not be made for longer than  2 years, which was a precaution against keep ing large standing armies without having, as  the Constitution said, evlden_t necessity.  And this isn't just ancient histol'y ... be cause; as Chief of Staff, each year I appear  before Congress for a  prolonge.d period of  sessions with committees of Congress and in dividual members of Congress to make the  case for the Army and the funds necessary  to mise, support, and equip the United States  Army. The Congress. therefore, bears a very  heavy responsibility to insure that, as the de bates now go on, we do not beco.rne inferior.  In September 1789, the Congress incorpo rated under the Constitution this army they  had inherited frmn the Confederation. This,  too, had a very significant o.vertone to it be cause allegiance of this Army that r lead is  not one pledged to a.n  individual as  is so  often the case in other armies o! the world this Army is pledged to the United States  Constitution,  to bear true faith and alle giance to that Constitution and to defend  and support it against an enemies, foreign  and domestic.  I have been very proud (}f the United States  . ~~~~;ret~~ ~~t:r~~;!d0fs~~~~th~~~  their commitment from the country of South  Vietnam and from the people of South Viet nam,  tbe United States Army followed by  coming home. TheTe were no bitter outcries  and no revolts. Our Army  is then a very  unique army. Look around the world and see  the consequence of the withdrawal o! other  armies from Algeria and the withdrawal ot  the army from Angola.. Those other a.rmles  returned from those places in revolt and torn  by dissent. We should be thankful that your  Army does not pledge allegiance to any single  individual. We pledge our allegiance to the  Constitution of. the United States.  There ar.e  a  lot of  the same questions  asked today that were asked 200 years ago.  Why do you need an Army? How much is  enough? And one particUlar one has to do  with considering our momlity as a Nation is force relevan't to the problems and chal lenges. that con!I:on.t us.? wen. I could make  a sp.eech on that subject; you could write a  book or books about it. But the bottom line,  I  think, is a fairly simple and straight for ward idea. Armed strength and force was  relevant to Hanoi not too long ago. It was  relevent to the Cubans in Angola. Obviously,  it is relevant to the Soviet Union. And thus  military strength is very much relevant to  the circumstance in which we :find ourselves  today.  ",1976

I would just like to make one simple  point. There 1s a very real possib111ty that  a new administration a year from now  or 2 years from now will decide  that  this carrier is not needed. Let us remem ber one thing about the argument for  this carrier. It does not depend on the  Soviet threat, on which so much of the  argument for our defense procurement  depends. This is not an area where the  Soviet threat 1s a factor. This is, first of  all, not a strategic weapon. It is a weap on to be used for other purposes. It Js  recognized that it is not of significance  in a strategic sense.  This is an area where the Soviets have  no strength. They have no equivalent to  any of our attack carriers. They have  one medium carrier and one more, I bethe  lieve, under construction. So it is not an  area where we are responding to a So viet threat.  What we have been told we should be  concerned about is that the Soviet Union  has been building a navy with a -great  many ships and we are told we are fall ing behind because of this. Thus, a year  from now a decision might be made to  go for more ships and for less expensive  carriers that will not end up costing us  $3 or $4 billion apiece.  ",1976

I believe that this  is entirely the wrong approach to take  regarding our Nation's energy problem.  I, therefore, commend to my colleagues  the following article by Prof. W ~ Philip  Gramm from  the Wall Street Journal  of November 30, 1973:  THE ENERGY CRISIS IN PERSPECTIVE  (By W.

234,,94,-0.085,1210,15,Mr. ROGERS.," Mr. Speaker, several  weeks ago, the National Council on AI  coholism, the largest voluntary organiza tion in this country in the :field of al coholism, held its highly successful na tional forum here in Washington, D.C.  More than 2,000 delegates attended this  meeting, and I was privileged, along with  several of my colleagues in the Congress,  to address the forum.  A highlight of the forum activities was  the banquet at which more than 50 of  America's most famous people identified  themselves as  recovered alcoholics.  It  was a deeply moving occasion and, in my  opinion, it will go a long way toward re moving the stigma which has surrounded  this disease for so many decades.  At this point in my remarks, I would  like to include a description of the event  prepared by the National Council on Al coholism:  OPERATION UNDERSTANDING  to  More  than 50 notables  identified  them selves as recovered alcoholics here tonight at  an  ""Operation  Understanding""  banquet  which John Maciver, President of the Na tional Council on Alooholism, described as  ""an event which will do more  reduce  alcoholism stigma  than anything ever at tempted.""  ' Mr. Maciver pointed out that until now  only a  few public figures have ever stated  that they are recovered alcoholics.  ""Tonight, for the first time, famous enter tainers, an astronaut, a surgeon, an airline  captain, a member of the Congress of the  United States, the chief of an Indian Nation,  a member of Great Britain's House of Lords,  sports luminaries and leaders from the worlds  of business, finance, labor, religion, politics,  philanthropy, public affairs, health, journal ism,  literature and  the armed  forces  are  standing together as recovered alcoholics to  in tonight's  to  demonstrate thaj; alcoholism  is a  treatable  disease and presenting a  united front  eliminate the stigma which is kllling people  needlessly,"" he said.  Mr. Maciver  stated  that  the National  Council on Alcoholism organized and spon sored tonight's function ""to dispel once and  for all the myth that alcoholism is something  which does not happen to 'nice' people.""  ""This disease affeots people from all walks  of  life,"" he said. ""There are an estimated  10,000,000 alcoholics  in the United States,  less  than 3% of whom are in a  skid row  situation. The balance comes from all walks  of life.""  He added: ""We view this as a turning point  in NCA's 30-year campaign to remove  the  stigma attached to alcoholism.

235,,94,0.269,1223,15,Mr. BROYHILL.," Mr.  Speaker,  on  Tuesday of this week the Committee on  Banking and Currency  completed  its  consideration of H.R. 12112,  the Syn thetic Fuels Loan Guarantee legislation  which was reported by the Committee on  Science and Technology on May 15. The  legislation has also been sequentially re ferred to the Committees on Interstate  and to the Ways and Means, in addition  to the Banking Committee.  and Foreign Commerce, on which I serve,  In my view, The Banking Committee  19061  has not faced up to some of the broad  philosophical issu~ contained in this bill  and has unwisely reported favorably on  this vast new program for the Energy  Research and Development Administra tion. That program is  to provide bil lions of dollars of loan guarantees for  energy development so questionable that  the private sector has, so far, chosen not  to involve itself. Down the road, accord ing to ERDA, we can expect to be asked in addition to the loan guarantees-for  construction grants and price supports!  Indeed, this is virtually the same pro gram the House so resoundingly defeated  last December.  Fortunately, one alert member of the  Banking  and  Currency Committee probably to be joined by others of his  committee colleagues who see this pro gram for what it realy is-has prepared  dissenting views for the committee's re port. My colleague from Texas, Dr. RoN  PAUL has prepared some very persuasive  dissenting views, and I would like to take  this opportunity to call these views to the  attention of my colleagues:  DISSENTING VIEWS ON H.R. 12112  H.R. 12112  (By Dr. RoN PAUL)  seeks  to establish a Federal  loan guarantee and price support system !or  the manufacture of synthetic fuel. We are  told that world reserves of petroleum and  natural gas are declining at a. rapid rate and  that the United States is dangerously de pendent on foreign sources for such fuel.  With ample quantities of coal and oil sha.le  available, therefare, it would seem that the  production of synthetic fuel derived from  such sources is a.  logical and necessary step  toward ""ene-rgy independence."" No one dis putes the necessity of obtaining-additional  sources of energy for the future. The ques tion is simply why must the government-be come  involved  in such a  prograzn? Why  aren't private incentives sumcient?  We are told that the risks involved in the  manufacture of synfuels are so great that  private  investors will not undertake them.  Mr. W. T. Slick,  senior vice-president of  Exxon, listed four primary reasons why they  are not already being manufactured, though  the  technology for synfuels already exists:  ""L Legislative ana regulatory uncertain ties. Oil price controls, gas price regulation  threatened divestiture  legislation,  bility of federal resources, unreasonable en Vir~nmenta.l regulations, and uncertain fiscal  policy.  access!~  ""2.  Financial  uncertainty.  Synthetics  plants are inherently capital intensive. Costs  in the process construction  industry have  doubled since 1972, resulting in a significant  increase in financial risk. In addition, in vestors may be unwilling to proVide capital  because the uncertain legislative and regu lato~ environment may jeopardize the com pletlOn or profitability of the project.  ""3. Technological uncertainties. Although  the process technology has been proven in  laboratory or  even pilot-scale opEU""ations,  substantial uncertainties remain about the  commercial-scale  operations.

237,House,94,-0.311,155,20,Mr. WEAVER.," Mr. Chairman, I would  like  to point out another reason why  bankers fear nuclear power besides tech nology, and that is because of the stag gering cost of the plants.  As one who once sought a cheap source  of energy, I have been astounded at the  cost rises, a µd  the American people will  be shocked, too, when they get their bills.  We do not really realize how expensive  this power has become.  Let me give  the Members  the hard  facts. At the Washington Nuclear Power  Plant No. 5 it costs $1,300 a kilowatt ca pacity. This will  require a 5-cent-per kilowatt charge, on up  to 80 mills per  kilowatt. This  is  like $50-a-barrel oil.  These are hard facts.  Mr. Chairman, if we had guaranteed  the Ford Motor Co. on every Edsel it  built, we would still be building Edsels.  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair  recog nizes the gentleman from New York <Mr.  DOWNEY).

240,House,94,-0.298,155,20,Mr. FISHER.," Mr. Chairman, I have  been listening to this debate and testing  it against some years of experience in  the energy field. As a result, I come to  the conclusion that we should vote for  the Bingham amendment.  I really do not think the time is ripe  for  turning  this uranium enrichment  industry over, or beginning  to  turn it  over, to private enterprise.  The demand for the product is quite  uncertain. The technology is still chang ing rapidly. The health, safety, and en vironmental  aspects  are  not  clearly  known, and  the effects are potentially  grave. Because of these uncertainties and  risks, private industry cannot come  without the massive Government  loan  guarantees and other assurances called  for  in  this bill.  It makes much more  sense to approve the Bingham amend ment and defer bringing private com panies  into  the nuclear  fuel  industry  until conditions are such that they can  operate successfully as part of the competitive market economy.  .  It seems  to me quite clear that the  risks of proliferation are much greater  with a number of companies  involved  than they would be if uranium enrich ment remains under Government aus pices for a while. The United States is  not the only country that produces nu clear fuel but that does not-lessen the  responsibility of Congress to do what it  can to hold prolif era ti on in check.  Mr. Chairman, to those companies and  unions  that are worried about  jobs  would simply say that add-ons at the  Government facility would still be built  and operated by private enterprise.  The cost of producing additional en riched  uranium  in  privately  owned  plants compared to Government-owned  plants is not known. Probably the costs  would not be too much different assum ing contracts in each case are efficiently  negotiated in the public interest. How ever, the opportunities for large profits  would appear  to be greater under the  provisions of the Committee's bill than  with the Bingham amendment.  For all  the  reasons and despite my  basic preference for private enterprise  in industrial production, I shall vote for  the Bingham amendment. I urge my col leagues to do the same.  The CHAffiMAN.

244,,94,-0.443,246,20,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, on May  4 of this year, I had the pleasure to ap pear on the Robert MacNeil Report, a  nationally televised program carried by  Public Broadcasting service. The May 4  program dealt with regulatory reform of  Federal airline regulation. I participated  in the program with John Snow, Deputy  Under Secretary of the Department of  Transportation,  Col.  Frank Borman,  president of Eastern Airlines, Charles E.  Griffiths of Nashville Metropolitan Air port Authority. We discussed the prob able effects of less Federal control over  airline  ticket prices and market entry  into the airline industry, and of more  reliance on competition and consumer  demand. The overwhelming evidence in dicates that less Government regulation  would bring more efficient service at sig nificantly  lower prices. The airlines of  Texas and California, for example, who  are not subject to Federal regulation fly  modern jet equipment at air fares that  are anywhere from 30 to 60 percent less  than  those charged by CAB-regulated  carriers over the same and similar routes.  The Senate Subcommittee on Admin istrative Practice and Procedure, which  I chair, studied these issues for 18 months  and issued a comprehensive report which  unanimously  recommended  a  gradual  transition  to  less  regulation and more  competition. Legislation  to accomplish  this goal has been proposed by myself,  President Ford, a unanimous Civil Aero nautics Board, and others. Just recently  the distinguished Senator from Nevada  and chairman of  the Senate A via ti on  Subcommittee <Mr. CANNON)  proposed  legislation to reform airline regulation.  In spite of the clear evidence that more  competition will better serve the inter ests of  the flying public,  the airlines  themselves  have  fought  vigorously  against meaningful change.  This is quite understandable when we  realize that current regulation protects  existing airlines from price competition  and from market entry by new, innova tive firms. Airline executives are quite re luctant to loosen their grip on a closed,  self-protective oligopoly.  During the course of the May 4 televi sion discussion, Colonel Borman vigor ously def ended  the  industry's position  against less regulation and argued that  the regulated airline industry ""is prob ably one of the most competitive indus tries in the United States."" Yet, a Gov ernment agency in Washington literally  fixes uniform coach and first-class air  fares  for all  the large airlines  in  the  United States. A Government adminis tered price-fixing system is not usually  thought to be consistent with competi tive market structures.  Mr. Borman also claimed  that  less  regulation would result in a drastic re duction of air service. He repeated the  CONGRESSIONAL .RECORD SENATE  August 2, 1976  familiar argument that airlines subsidize  a large degree of unprofitable air service  to small communities with the revenues  gained from serving routes that regula tion protects from competition. I say this  argument is familiar because it was pre sented time and time again during hear ings before  the Senate Administrative  Practice and Procedure Subcommittee in  1974 and 1975. In each case,  the par ticular argument was either shown to be  either exaggerated or false. But, Colonel  Borman submitted an impressive study  purporting to support his argument.  For the benefit of the nationwide TV  audience, Eastern Airline's president pre sented Mr. Snow of the Department of  Transportation with  a  3-page  list of  nearly 200 of Eastern's routes that Mr.  Borman  represented were  the  bene ficiaries  of  cross-subsidy. He claimed  that many of them would be abandoned  under total deregulation.  Mr. President, careful analysis of that'  list by the Department of Transportation  reveals how incorrect those claims were.  It turns out, for example, that Eastern  already discontinued service on 24 of the  160 domestic route segments on that list.  And it did so under regulation, not de regulation. Moreover,  for  133  of  the  domestic segments, Eastern provides air  service far in excess of what current reg ulation requires. It is hard to believe that  Eastern's voluntary choice to offer these  discretionary levels of service is not re lated to the profit motive. In fact, careful  analysis indicates that only three domes tic route segments on the list may be the  beneficiaries of cross subsidies. This is  a far cry from concluding that some 200  of Eastern's air routes would lose service  under less regulation-which is the mis taken impression that may have been left  with the nationwide television audience.  Mr. President, I am afraid that mis taken arguments about loss of air service  will continue to be made by those who  want to defeat responsible proposals for  reform. But, perhaps some airline share holders will  take a more enlightened  view. The fact is that the traveling public  will not be the only group to benefit from  reform. It appears that airline share holders will also benefit because the pros pects for profits are greater under less  regulation. This is the unmistakable and  documented conclusion of financial ana lyst Thomas A. Trantum of H. C. Wain wright & Co.  in New York City. In his  detailed July 8, 1976, ""Industry Review,""  Mr. Trantum concludes that the ""direc tion toward less  regulation appears  to  increase the chances of a more profitable  industry."" The financial interests of air line shareholders and the broad public  interest of the Nation's travelers are not  in conflict with each other. It is about  time to get that message across to travel ers, airline snareholders, airline execu tives, and those of us in Congress.  I ask unanimous consent that the De partment of Transportation study of the  Eastern route list and the H. C. Wain wright & Co. analysis of industry proftts  under less regulation be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the material  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  AN ANALYSIS OF EASTERN'S UNPROFITABLE  DOMESTIC SEGMENTS  SUMMARY  Careful analysis of Eastern's 160 unprofit a.ble domestic segments  for 1975  indicates  that cross-subsidies may be required to con tinue certificated service over only three of  those segments. Of the other 157, 24 have  already been discontinued. For the other 133,  Eastern provides a  level of service in excess  of  any apparent  regulatory  requirements.  Since Eastern is voluntarily providing serv ice  in excess of  the minimum  that  is re quired,  it would not seem that  these seg ments are  likely candidates  for  abandon ment, but are profitable in a more relevant  sense.  Further the essential nature of the East ern  service on  the  three segments which  may  require  cross-subsidization  appears  questionable. Other carriers, both certificated  and com.muter, provide significant alternate  service  to  the constraining points on  the  unprofitable Eastern segments. Any  loss of  Eastern service would not  imply  that the  communities in question wm have lost access  to the nation's air service network.  Frequently in the debate over regulatory  reform of the aviation industry, industry rep resentatives have presented lists of segments  served which are ""net loss"" segments and re ceive cross-subsidization. The clear implica tion 1s that service to these segments will be  abandoned in the absence of protective reg ulation, which provides profits  in certain  markets to support service over losing markets.    Careful analysis of these lists usually in dicates, however,  that  few  if any of  the  segments are  likely  to be abandoned. Last  year, as part of its study of Civil Aeronautics  Board practices and procedures, the Senate  Subcommittee on Administrative Practice  and Procedure broke down a list from United  of 327 ""losing"" city-pairs to 29  route seg ments which were in fact susceptible to loss  of service. These constituted one-half of one  percent of tJnited's revenue passenger miies.  This short paper  is  intended  to analyze  a similar list of 160 ""losing"" domestic seg ments provided by Eastern. The analysis  is  restricted  to a  consideration of  the possi bility of abandonment. The simple criteria  ut111zed  is  to examine  the question  as  to  whether the service provided  in each  seg ment is required by CAB regulation. If not,  Eastern is free to abandon the segment ir respective of regulatory reform. The obvious  question 1s  then, why haven't these ""un profitable"" segments already been dropped.  The answer, provided by Frank Borman in  his recent House testimony, is that  the seg ments are not truly unprofitable, despite the  fact that fully allocated costs are not cov ered by  ticket  revenues over  the segmP,nt.  As a first step, the logical question  to ask  1s what portion of that losing service is in  fact required via Eastern's certificate obli gations.  Using the abandonment criterion, 1f East ern may voluntarily eliminate and reduce  service on the losing segments and does not,  one must suppose they are proceeding ration ally, and that the 1975 losses are expected to  be  temporary  or misrepresent  the  true  situation.  The air carrier's certificate 1s constituted  by a listing of authorized points which eon stitute a  route. The carrier has freedom to  operate as much capacity as it may wish in  the exercise of sound business judgment subject only to the minimum level of service .  ",1976
245,Senate,94,-0.108,272,20,Mr. CASE.," Mr. President, 1 year has  passed since the United States, the Soviet  Union, and other members of the NA TO  ,and Warsaw pacts signed the Helsinki  accord, known formally as the Final Act  .of the Conference on Security and Co operation in Europe.  Since then, there has been a consider able amount of concern in the West as  to whether the signatory nations are liv-  ing up to the promises they made, espe cially in the human rights area.  As a result of this concern, Congress  earlier this year passed legislation  in troduced by Congresswoman FENWICK  and me to establish a 15-member com mission to monitor compliance with the  Helsinki accord. The Commission held its  first preliminary meeting last week and  it is hoped that the administration will  decide soon to name its members to the  group.  Newspaper articles printed on the an niversary of the August 1, 1975, signing  of the Helsinki accord indicate that there  are valid reasons to doubt whether the  humans iights sections of the agreement  are being implemented. I .ask unanimous  consent that several articles on the issue  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the articles  were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  [From the Washington Post, Aug. 2, 1976]  THE HELSINKI ACCORD:  ITS FIRST  ANNIVERSARY  (By Murrey Marder)  After a year in operation, the controversial  35-nation Helsinki accord on security and  cooperation in Europe can record one undis puted claim: it has survived.  That is no mean accomplishment in the  case of two principal signatories, the United  States and  the Soviet Union.  In  the  12  months, especially as a result of the Angolan  oonfl.icit,  in which Soviet-suppor,ted Cuban  troops overwhelmed American-backed  fac tions, the euphoria of American-Soviet rela tions has dissolved in a pervasive chill.  Success in East-West relations, particularly  in the United States,  is now measured by  lowered expectations, and by marginal incre ments. On that reduced scale, pursuit of the  goals set at Helsinki is counted as useful ""in a moderate way,"" as one senior U.S. offi cial put it last week.  By  contrast,  Soviet  leader  Leonid  I.  Brezhnev said last week that the first anni versary of the Aug. 1, 1975, accord at Helsinki  proves that ""the conference was an event of  ennormous importance.""  Soviet publications during the past week  have been brimming with self-congratulatory  accounts of  the Soviet accomplishment at  Helsinki-where East and West met with  contradictory objectives.  To the Soviet Union, Helsinki confirmed  the ""inviolability of frontiers"" in Europe as  they were extended under Communist rule  at the end of World War II. To the Western  powers, the significance of the Helsinki ac cord is its sections stressing the freerer pas sage of people and ideas across frontiers.  As a result, the two sides consistently col lide over what each interprets as carrying out  the letter or the spirit of the Helsinki accord,  turning  the turgid agreement into an all purpose weapon for cross-accusation.  Nevertheless, both sides find advantages in  exploiting the accord.  ""Now,"" said one Ford administration offi cial, ""we have a  forum for complaints-an  area for legitimate discourse to discuss hu manitarian concerns, and they respond-al beit in a limited way.""  Even the Soviet news agency, Tass, which  last week hailed the achievements of Hel sinki as ""already considerable,"" acknowledged  that ""it is only the beginning. Quite nat urally, the process will take many years and  maybe even decades."" .  By American  standards,  modest.  There have been  invitations  to Western  officers from North Atlantic Treaty Organiza tion nations to two areas of Soviet miUtary  maneuvers. Greek and Turkish observers ait tended maneuvers  in  the southern  region  of  the Soviet Union, and m111tary  repre sentatives from Norway  (and from Sweden  and Finland, which are not NATO members)  observed maneuvers near Leningrad.  A State DepartmeD.Jt  official  said  there  have been some notifications to the Soviets  of Western maneuvers, but no Soviet ob servers so far.  The Soviet Union also has proposed gen eral  conferences on  the environment, on  transport, and on energy. These have been  declined, at least by the United States, on  grounds  there are other adequate  forums  for such discussions. The United States, how ever, because o! the Angola conflict, post poned cabinet-level meetings with the Soviet  Union on similar topics.

249,Senate,94,-0.38,350,20,Mr. EAGLETON.," Mr. President,  the  bill before the Senate contains the larg est peacetime increase in defense spend ing in our history. It calls for a massive  15  percent  increase over  the amount  appropriated  last year.  In effect,  this  means that at a  time when other Fed eral programs are being dramatically  cut back, we will provide 9 to 10 percent  real growth for defense.  If we were to appropriate all that the  President  asked,  the  defense  budget  alone would account for one-quarter of  all Federal spending and 70 percent of  all controllable outlays. Almost 50 per cent of all Federal revenues not ear marked  for  trust  funds would go  to  defense.  Mr. President, what actual threat de mands such an increase in the tax dol lars dedica.ted to national security? An  objective answer to this question is diffi cult to come by. This is especially true  . in a political year when the discussion  of ""gaps"" becomes fashionable-missile  gaps, ship gaps, tank gaps, and credibil ity gaps are the order of the day.  This Bicentennial Year was ushered in  with a series of official pronouncements  about increases in Soviet defense spend ing, about U.S. inferiority in lrny military  areas, about  the need  to demonstrate  American determination. The Pentagon  was starting early this year-they had  quickly learned the exigencies of the new  budget process.  The budget request for defense went  forward, therefore, in a contrived atmos phere of fear. And it called for a massive  financial response to meet the described  threat. We had to ""send a message"" to  the Soviet Union and, more importantly,  we were told that the American people  need reassurance that the United States  was not second best.    Soviet  manpower  strengths  were  grossly  exaggerated  by  ignoring  the  asymmetries between  the two systems.  Leaked  intelligence  reports on Soviet  airpower counted some aircraft  twice,  some which had been mothballed, some  which  had  limited,  defensive-only  capabilities.  The Soviet Navy suddenly became a  ""blue-water"" threat in areas far from  the Soviet Union where logistical sup port was sorely lacking. Reports of un precedented growth in Soviet naval power  ignored the qualitative superiority and  overall tonnage advantage of American  ships. Trends in ship numbers put out by  the Navy showed that the Soviet fleet was  increasing while our was shrinking. Yet  the opposite was true, as the Navy later  admitted when looking at a different set  of statistics.  To counter the false claims, those on  the other side of the debate may have  downplayed  the  threat.  There  was  evidence that we had fallen behind in  conventional capability  in Europe,  for  example, yet this reality was ignored by  the Penitagon's critics. There was a  le.  '  '  .  $2  We overestimated inflation. It was that...  which caused our budget to be repriced in  real terms by about $2 billion. Because inflation was  less  than anticipated,  there  is  more real growth.  The only  logical conclusion  is  that the  President expects Congress  to cut at least  $6 bilUon, and has added about that much  cushion to his budget. If we made cuts, in  an effort to ellminate waste and keep overall Federal spending within prudent levels  then I suppose the administration will at~  tack us  for  'deep, savage,  and  arbitrary   cuts. The President, in short, seems  to be  playing a cynical and dangerous game with  the defense budget.  gitimaite cause for some ccmcern, yet it  was obscured by the necessity of scoring  points in the political debate.  It is clear today in my view  that some  real growth in the defense budget lS warranted. It is equally clear that the Pentagon, perceiving a  fertile political environment, is asking for the Moon and  the stars. The cost we will all have to pay  is a reduction in the overall security of  ~is Nation-a reductipn in ou! capaMr. President, as Senator HOLLINGS  city to protect ourselyes from the internal  observed,  the President's own strategy  threats of  stagnation,  unemployment,  assumes a $6 billion reduction in this bill.  and urban d~cay   .

Never has waste been so  House Appropriations Committee-blatantly  identified and never has  the  failure of Congress to eliminate it been  so well highlighted. The President, to use  Senator HOLLINGS' words, played a cyni cal and dangerous game with the defense  budget and Congress let him get a way  with it.  Mr. President, the $1 billion reduction  proposed in this amendment will still not  bring the overall reduction on this bill  close  to  the $6 billion cut anticipated.  But it will signal the displeasure of the  American taxpayer over  the totally ir responsible game that has been played  with  this budget. It will eliminate the  entire amount  inserted  in  this budget  for cut insurance. And, hopefully, .it will  eliminate the cynicism over congressional  procedures which accompanied such a  willful abuse of the budgetary process.  Sadly, that cynicism has now been car ried one step further. Two weeks ago the  administration announced  that  it was  submitting a  supplemental  request  to  Congress asking for a net increase in the  defense budget of still another $1 billion.  In the absence of any resistance to the  massive requests which have preceded it,  this new request comes forth in main part  because Congress has acquiesced to the  fear tactic. Is this fiscal responsibility?  Is this ""get-it-now"" policy the true re flection of fiscal conservatism?  Mr. President, the amendment offered  by  Senator HATFIELD  and myself,  adopted by the House-Senate conference,  will force the conferees to seek to accom modate differences by taking the lower  amounts on many, though not necessar ily all,  line items in disagreement. We  are not asking the Secretary of Defense  to make  the  requisite  reductions. The  total amount recommended can be easily  reached in conference and, consequently,  by Congress itself.  Can $1 billion in cuts be made without  endangering our national security? I be lieve that my previous discussion of the  way this budget was devised adequately  responds  to  that question. Nonetheless,  As it turned out, therefore, the overall  reduction Congress made again came  down to the 4 to 5 percent level, though  we thought we had cut more. The original  cushion  the Pentagon had anticipated  was restored.  This year, however, we saw the cushion  concept raised to new levels of executive  branch arrogance. An OMB memoran dum surfaced in.the New York Times on  February 4, 1976, stating that $3 billion  had been added to the defense budget  as ""padding"" or ""cut insurance"" against  anticipated  congressional  reductions.  This was  in addition to $4.4 billion to  cover inflation and $2.9 billion in ""real  growth."" The OMB memorandum read:  Last year and again this year,  the Presi dent requested an annual increase of 4 per cent in real defense purchases-or 2 percent  overall. This is, he wants an increase, over  and above  inflation,  that would allow de fense purchases to grow at 4 percent a year  over the next 5 years. Last year the Congress  exceeded this target by a  large margin. We  provided 10 percent real growth in invest ment  operations  and maintenance  pur chases, after cutting the budget request by  more than $7 billion. This year the Presi dent is seeking real growth in purchases of  about $8.5 billion, or about 16.3 percent- considerably above the 4 percent long-term  growth  rate which he has  repeatedly  re quested.  Cut insurance of $3 billion is provided as  a cushion for congressional action.  Mr. President, my distinguished col league  from South Carolina, Senator  HOLLINGS, who is the chairman of a spe cial Budget Committee  task  force on  defense spending, made  the following  observations about this unusual memo randum and  the President's defense budget request in a .floor speech on Feb ruary 4, 1976:  if  ",1976

254,House,94,-0.218,441,20,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support .of this  much needed bill. Small breweries today  are facing an uphill fight, and unless  some relief  is granted, and soon,  they  will have disappeared. The numbers tell  the story-in 1935 there were 750 brew ing companies. Today there are less than  100 br~wing companies. Another inter esting  statistic,  in  1935  the  average  brewer in this country sold 57,000 barrels  of beer a year. In 1975  this figure was  2,800,000 or almost 50 times as much in  an annual year. But closely related  t.o  this, is that the major brewers now have  an increasing share of the market. While  in 1950  the 15  largest brewers  in  the  United States represented 45 percent of  total beer sales, in 1974 this increased to  89 percent. It is apparent  that unless  some change is made the small brewers  will be forced out of business and the  industry will consist only of the giants.  For the small brewer, the business will  be flat.  This bill would simply reduce the tax  on beer from $9  to $7 a barrel for the  first 60,000 barrels removed each calen dar year  for consumption or sale. To  make sure that only the small brewers  b'enefit it is limited to a brewer who pro duces no more than 2 million barrels per  year. The cost to the Treasury is mini mal, estimated at less  than $5 million,  yet it means a great deal to these small  brewers in their competitive world.  bo  The small brewer today is beset from  within and from without. Besides  the  competition with the major brewers, they  face increasing competition from imports  from foreign countries. In 1965, imported  beer  represented about 662,000 barrels  and by 1974, this had jumped by 109 per cent to over 1,385,000 barrels. In 1975,  through  8 months,  the. figures  had  jumped again by-20 percent. The result  has been that many of the small brewers  have suffered m.aterial losses. There are  now only 39 brewing companies remain ing that would qualify for the help pro vided in this bill, that is,  that produce  no more than 2,000,000 barrels per year.  Yet these 39 small brewers are located in  20 States and employ over 12,600 workers.  In fact,  these 12,600  jobs have more  impact  than  their numbers. Many of  these 39 breweries are located in small  rural areas. The brewery's work force  oftentimes is the sustaining life blood of  the community. For example,  the beer  making town in my district is Shiner. If  the Spoetzl Brewing Co. went under, the  flow of life would be dried up in Shiner.  Many Members have told me that a  similar situation exists in their district- a  struggling brewery  in a  small  town  fighting to survive.  Economically, these small brewers af fect other industries. They purchased ag ricultural products, barley, malt, corn,  hops, to the tune of $75,000,000 in 1974.  They purchased packaging supplies  in  the amount of $220,000,000. They paid  over $93,000,000  in wages and salaries  not including fringe benefits to their em ployees. In addition, they paid approxi mately $59,000,000 in StaJte excise taxes.  Other industries are also affected upon  the small brewers including the money  spent on fuel, power, and water, trans portation, advertising, and banking.  Congress has been aware of the prob lems of the small breweries for some time.  It was included in the tax reform bill that  the Ways and Mean& Committee reported  last session, but when that did not be come law, the reduction in the beer tax  died along with it.  In concluding, I want to take note of  the competitive problems in the beer in dustry. What little opposition has been  expressed about this bill has focused on  helping the small brewers in antitrust ac tion, not in the Tax Code.  Certainly a great case can be made  that the Federal Trade Commission  is  asleep at the wheel in policing the anti trust laws. In fact, I made such a case in  hearings I conducted when I was on the  Commerce Committee. So to my friends  who  say  take  care  of  this  problem  through antitrust laws, I say amen.  But the Agency charged with this job  has been foot dragging for 6 years on this  issue. The people are tired of being tied  up  in bureaucratic  shuffles  and  legal  niceties.  Right here, with this bill, we can help  now. Let us at least take the route of  possibility, instead of waiting for the FTC  work to come to a head.  The bill is fair, and I urge your support.

255,House,94,0.146,480,20,Mr. WAMPLER.," Mr. Speaker, lumber  prices, already high, will again move up ward unless Congress quickly clarifies  the authority of the Forest Service  to  make timber harvesting decisions in na tional forests.  Legislation to accomplish this, in the  form of S. 3091  is currently resting on  the Senate  calendar  awaiting  action.  Markup sessions are underway  in the  House Committee on Agriculture involv ing study of seven different bills.  Authority to decide what trees should  be harvested was lost by the Forest Serv ice in four States involving nine national  forests, as a  result of the August 1975  Mononga.shela court decision.  Action by Congress is needed quickly  because other judges all across the coun try may use this decision as a precedent,  thereby increasingly paralyzing the ca pacity of the Forest Service to play its  normal role in helping to meet the timber  and wood product needs of America.  Already two judges, one in Texas and  one in Alaska, have issued decisions pat terned after the Monongahela decision.  Authorities have  recently  estimated  that if the Monongahela decision is ap plied to all national forests, timber cut ting from these areas would be reduced  a drastic 50 percent. Such a  cutback  would eventually result in a 15-percent  price hike for softwood lumber and would  cause plywood prices to escalate at least  75 percent.  Price increases of this magnitude for  softwood  products would  be  nothing  short of tragic. Housing is already so ex pensive  that many Americans  simply  cannot afford to own a home.  The judge in the Monongahela case  decided  that  the 1897  legislative  lan guage, which gives the Forest Service its  authority to harvest timber in national  forests,  restricts  the Forest Service  to  authorizing cutting of only ""dead, ma ture or large growth trees,""  thus pro hibiting use of scientific forest manage ment practices.  The judge also said that the legisla tion language probably needs to be modi fied, and that is what Congress is cur rently doing. But speed is needed. Cer tainly action is needed before Congress  adjourns for the election.  The Monongahela  decision,  as  ap pealed, affects,  in addition to the Mo nongahela National Forest in West Vir ginia, eight other national forests in the  jurisdication of the Fourth Circuit Court  of Appeals. This includes forests in the  States of Virginia, West Viriginia, and  North and South Carolina.  Some people object to granting Forest  Service professionals authority to man age harvesting operations  in national  forests-a power they have been using  for years. Other proposals call on Con gress itself to set rigid rules and regula tions as to what trees may be cut and  harvesting methods that may be used.  Such  restrictions,  I believe, would be  impractical. Instead, I believe, Congress  should delegate authority  to the silvi culturist while exercising more  inten sively its oversight responsibilities with  respect to all Forest Service operations.  Quick action by the Congress is needed,  not only to stave off lumber and other  wood product price  increases, but also  to prevent other harmful consequences  that occur to all multiple uses  if the  Monongahela decision were applied  to  all national forest areas.  For  instance,  such  wouldCut total U.S. production of softwood  timber about 12% percent at a time when  houS'ing starts are increasing;  Put an estimated total of 36,400 pri mary wood product workers out of a job;  ripple effects would put additional work ers off payrolls;  cause nonindustry private owners of  timber land to overcut mature woods and  cut prematurely young  timber stands,  eventuality  an  the cost of har thereby reducing our long-range Poten tial to meet national needs for lumber  and other wood products;  Reduce  the Forest Service's capacity  to manage  timber cutting and wildlife  habitat in national forests in ways that  would  stimulate production of desired  species; and  Increase materially  vesting  timber.  The penalties of a long delay in pas sage of this needed legislation becomes  even more sobering when one considers  that according to an assessment made at  the request of Congress,  it was deter mined that U.S. demand for lumber and  other wood  products will more  than  double in les,s than 50 years.  Wha.t is needed is Forest Service au thority to coI11tinue use of proven scien tific and professional  silviculture pat terns of  forest management  including  support for use of the time-tested mul tiple use-sustained yield  authority  as  carried out in conjunction with the Na tional Environmental Policy Act, the Re sources Planning Act, and other legis lation passed by Congress over the years.  The House and Senate committees have  worked hard to put acceptable legislative  language together. The goal has been to  create a working climate and a national  policy that will enable the Forest Serv ice to manage national forest resources  in such a manner as to best serve the  multiple  requirements of all people of  America.  Regardless of the efforts being made  by both bodies on this legislation, time is  growing short and  this  is an election  year. Moreover, the strong possibility also  exists  that  the  legislation now being  developed by the Subcommittee on For ests may be at odds with that ready for  floor action in the other body. If this  situation should come about, the results  could well mean a long, drawn out con ference that might not be decided in this  session of Congress.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker,  it becomes  most evident, that this Congress must be  prepared to enact emergency, temporary  legislation to authorize the Forest Serv ice  to continue  to decide whait  trees  should be harvested in the national for ests-leaving permanent  legislation  the next Congress.  A failure  to recognize this possibility  and to be prepared for this contingency  is  to invite chaos and high unemploy ment in the wood products industry in  the coming months.  to  LEA VE OF ABSENCE  By unanimous consent,  leave of ab sence was granted as follows  to:  Mr. PEPPER  (at  the  request Of Mr.  O'NEILL), for today, on account of ill ness in the family.

THE DILEMMA OF ENERGY POLICY  HON. PATRICIA SCHROEDER  OF COLORADO  IN THE HOUSE OF ~EPRESENTATIVES  Monday, August 2, 1976  ",1976
257,,94,-0.225,493,20,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, the  past several years have seen Congress  and the President tussle unsuccessfully  with developing a national energy strat egy. Not only are Congress and the Presi dent divided, but within the legislative  branch the committees display mutual  distrust and  jurisdictional chauvinism.  Likewise, within  the executive branch  similar disruptions occur.  The April 1976, Harvard Journal on  Legislation, contains an article, ""Prices  and Incomes: The Dilemma of Energy  Policy,"" which discusses the inability of  our Government to face up to its respon sibilities. The author, Gerard M. Bran non, is an economist wise in the ways of  political process. He uses the 1975 debate  over crude oil policy as a case study of  how  the  legislative  and  executive  branches deal, ineffectively, he concludes,  with price-income issues.  ""Prices and Incomes,"" is too lengthy  to reproduce here, so I recommend that  my colleagues obtain a copy from the  Library.  In brief, Professor Brannon asserts  that our country's consensus goals-to  reduce dependence on imported oil and  to develop alternative energy sources, can  be attained through a method that is  both economically efficient and equitable  to everyone. The method he proposes is  a free market program-decontrol-cou pled with windfall  taxes and  income  transfer to consumers.  Ptofessor Brannon argues further that  continued price control is ""a blatant en couragement to high energy consumption  and waste,"" as well as an economic im pediment to the development of alterna tive energy sources.  From the observations Professor Bran non makes, we can extrapolate the eco nomic wrongs that will be perpetua te<l  by the Nuclear Assurance Act and the  synthetic fuel subsidy bill.  Both bills are examples of Government  support and control of energy production  to the exclusion of free-market produc tion and energy conservation. Nuclear  energy, synthetic gas from coal, and syn thetic oil from shale will be subsidized in  the production stage and in the market place by gua.ranteed  loans, price sup ports, and the like.  We are duplicating our folly. As a re25111  sult of pressures for cheap and abundant  fuels and the aversion our entrepreneur ial class has for anything that smacked  of free enterprise, we will have another  artificial set-up like the present oil and  gas market.  As  a  result,  solar energy,  the one  energy source with a potential to be both  cheap and abundant, is overshadowed by  the false economies we construct for coal,  oil shale, and nuclear energy. These false  economies have already eliminated the  windmills and solar water heaters which  used to abound in the South. Meanwhile,  the rest of the energy-consuming world  looks on as the United States continues  to gulp up one-third of the annual world  energy production.  A TRIBUTE TO  JOHN McGUINESS  HON. GLENN M.

Today I am proud to take this oppor tunity  recognize  John McGuiness,  who for the past 22 years, has dedicated  both his  time and energy, displaying  outstanding service  in his capacity of  medical assistant to the Office of the At tending Physician. It is however, regret table at this time, we must commemorate  his retirement from that service, effective  .July 30, 1976.  John McGuiness, enlisted in the U.S.  Navy in August of 1942. His devotion and  skill  in  the field of medicine was  re warded by steady advancement, when in  1952, he achieved the prestigious rating  of chief hospital corpsman. While in the  Navy, John served with the 69th Naval  Construction Battalion-North Atlantic;  the U.S. Naval base  in New London,  Conn.; the Reserve Fleet in Charleston,  S.C.;  the U.S.S. Yellowstone; the Naval  Research Institute; and, in Naples, Italy.

259,,94,-0.514,519,20,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  pleased to bring to the attention of my  colleagues  the celebration today of the  14th anniversary of the independence of  our Caribbean neighbor,  the  island of  Jamaica. Long a  friend of  the United  States, known to Americans as one of  the most beautiful places on Earth, this  tiny nation has in recent months suf fered  from negative publicity  in  the  media resulting from the Government's  efforts to achieve rapid social and eco nomic change.  Jamaica's problems are not new. Beset  by  economic  and  social  difficulties  throughout the period of her independ ence, Jamaica is a poor nation with only  limited natural  resources. Unemploy ment has been a constant problem, and  presently it is estimated that the un employment rate in the society is over  30 percent.  The  Prime Minister  of  Jamajca,  Michael Manley, who has committed his  Government to a broad program of mod ernization, rectifying the sadly uneven  distribution of wealth and putting people  back to work. Since his election in 1972,  Mr. Manley has  taken  great  strides  toward achieving these goals. His man agement of the budget has reduced re markably the income disparities which  had  plagued  the  island,  primarily  through public works projects employ ing  thousands. For those  that remain  unemployed, education programs aim at  preparing young people for trades which  will be of use later in life. These latter  programs have also been responsible for  150,000 adult Jamaicans becoming liter ate. Finally, Mr. Manley's land reforms  have aided small farmers and resulted  in greater crop yields.  The Jamaican story is made more ex traordinary by the firm adherence by the  Prime Minister to democratic norms and  values. Unlike leaders of many developing nations, he has relied on popular  participation and local  involvement to  shape his policies. Mr. Manley is a leader  in the best tradition of liberal democracy  who understands the needs and concerns  of his people.  On the anniversary of independence,  Jamacia  looks  forward  to a  future of  prosperity much as we have recently done  during our Bicentennial celebration. The  Jamaican leadership deserves our praise  for the steps taken so far to assure this  for all her people, and it is in the best  interest of  the United States  to con tribute to her attempts at developing a  strong, democratic and equitable society.  That  is what -our Bicentennial  is  all  about. For my colleagues review, I would  like to insert a portion of a speech de livered by Prime Minister Manley on  May 12, 1976:  A WATERSHED  Jamaica is at one of those great difficult  taxing watershed moments that occur in his tory as a country evolves---a time of funda mental change.  In 1962 political  independence opened a  door, but those who led then forgot that we  had lived with two forms of difficulty-the  denial of political rights and an economic  system which cannot produce  justice  for  mankind.  IMPERIALISM  We are conscious of this and try to be the  agent  through which change  can be  ex pressed in Ja.maica.  We are the product of the process in his tory known as imperialism. That process es tablished a lopsided economy based on mono culture, made  us  dependent on  imports,  lacking in education, lacking in technology,  and  lacking  in  self-confidence.  It  also  planted a capitalist structure and psychology  in Jti.maica and divided  the people  into a  minority who were the beneficiaries of the  imperial process and a majority who were its  victims.  This system produced a situation whereby  in 1972 one-quarter of the adult population  could not find work; 300,000 could neUher  read nor write;  all our bauxite  lands had  been sold off to foreign ownership; such of  the best land as remained was concentrated  in a very few hand&.  Against  this  background Third World  leaders are working together to change the  world in which we live and trade.  MORAL RELATIONSHIP  Inside Jamaica,  the philosophy of demo cratic socialism seeks to achieve social jus tice, development and equality through the  political management of the econoinic proc ess. It seeks to define a moral relationship  between all the ci:tizens and to invoke polit ical management to secure  the most rapid  possible approach to that moral relationshlp.  It has to be democratic because only all of  the people, acting in concert, can ensure that  the political process secures a moral purpose  in the workings of the economy.  NATIONAL BROTHERHOOD  Attitudes will  have  to change  for  the  society to accept the idea of a morel out come to economic activity because the other  system has taught that the only purpose of  ecnonomic  activity  is personal ~in. The  changes will have to show that our economics  must be moral in its outcome, serving the  needs of the society 8iS a whole with proper  rewards to the individual and a wider sense  of national brotherhood.  Internally, one has to work towiards eon trol of the economy. This involves the power  of the state to create a framework of social  justice by developing the democratic insti tutions to ensure that people have the means  of making decisions that affect their lives.  It also means the development of our hu man resources so that they are capable in tellectually, emotionally and psychologically  of meeting the demands, opportunities, re sponsibllities and attitudinal  requirementts  of a society of justice.  1962-72  In exam.ining our present situation, we  have to take a look at the forces at work be tween 1962, when we ~ined political inde pendence, and 1972 when this Government  took office.  The period of  the 60s has come  to be  known as the booming 60s-a time of un precedented well-being  in  the world. Un employment, which was 13 percent in 1962,  had grown to 23.6 percent by 1972.    Taking  another  indicator, migration  in  1962, was 12,000 but in 1972 it had climbed to  31,000.  ,  25137  SINCE 1972  land  on  In contrast, 1972 we have:  revolutionised  the employment status of  women;  distributed  scale;  waged a major attack. on illiteracy;  returned bauxite lands to national owner ship.  I must deal with criticisms reg,arding help  to Jamaica from CUba in certain areas.  unprecedented  an  MICRO-DAMS  For example, microdams. We need water  for our poor farmers. CUba hes perfected the  technique of entrapping water  in micro dams.  It is planned to build 234 micro-dams in  four years with total capacity of 17.5 billion  gallons, which can  irrigate 50,000 acres of  new agricultural !rand. This has been made  possible by assistance frt>m CUba.  SPECIAL EMPLOYMENT  Only 4,000 of the 30,000 employed in the  Special Employment Programme are engaged  in street cleaning .and similar activities, and  only $7 million of the total of $53 mill1on is  spent on this aspect of the programme. The  remainder is employed in dynamic economic  activity providing essential  infrastructure,  mainly for farmers, such as watershed works,  roads, forest protection and terracing.  HOUSING  New  techniques have been introduced to  increase the amount of housing available to  the poor. The Cuba/Jamaica housing project  in Falmouth will  provide  426  3-bedroom  units and infrastructure. The prefabrication  plant was given by the Cuban Government.  The Sites and Services Programme will pro vide 6,000 units in 3 years.  EDUCATION  In  education,  basic  school  enrollment,  which stood at 58,000 in 1972, will pass the  100,000 mark this year. The budgetary pro vision of $250,000 in 1971 has been increased  to $4.2 m1llion this year.  Teachers in these schools who were earn ing as little as 50 cents per week are now  being paid between $20 and $25  through a  government subsidy.  Enrollment in the secondary and tertiary  school system has increased from 83,000 in  1971  to 151,000  in 1976. Overall, a  total of  101,900 additional places have been created  in the educational system.  The literacy programme is also moving for ward with a  total  registration of 175,000,  with some 55,000 actually having been made  literate. Targets for 1976 include an enroll ment of 200,000 and a teaching staff of 20,000  volunteers.  COST OF LIVING  On the cost of living, everyone knows how  we fought and our newest effort involves a  system of voluntary price investigators who  will begin work on a pilot basis in Manchester  and St. Elizabeth.  WAGES  It should be recognized, how~ver, that al though there was a 90 percent rise in the cost  of living between 1972 and 1975, remuner ation to employees rose from $660 m11lion  to $1,568 million, an increase of 137 percent.  National disposable income rose by 117 per cent.  In 1960,  the Jamaican economy provided  570,000 jobs, and, in 1972, 598,000-a growth  of 28,000 new jobs in twelve years.  In the four years 1972-76 this Government  has provided 87 ,000 new jobs.  A look at actual wages shows that a man's  pay went up from $1.50 per day to $2.10 be tween 1962 and 1972--40 percent. A woman's  wage  rose  from $1.35  to $1.60-18 percent.  After four years, the position ls that men's  wages have gone  from $2.10  to $5.SO  and  women's from $1.60  to $5.30-162 percent  and 231 percent respectively.  ",1976
260,Senate,94,-0.371,649,20,Mr. BURDICK.," Mr. President,  I  re quest that the Senator from Maine <Mr.  MusKIE) be added as a cosponsor of Sen-   ate Joint Resolution 101, to authorize the  President to issue annually a proclama tion designating that week in November  which  includes Thanksgiving Day as  ""National Family Week.""  Mr. President, I would like the record  to show  that Sena tor MUSKIE was  a  strong supporter of my National Family  Week proposal. It was an oversight that  his name was not added as a cosponsor  back in June when the measure was in troduced. Just so the record can be made  clear, I ask that his name be added as a  cosponsor now.  ",1976
261,House,94,-0.341,701,20,Mr. DUNCAN of Oregon.," Mr. Speaker,  the amendment offered by the gentleman  from California  to  this appropriation  bill does not have a great deal of emo tional appeal. Indeed, the reason for it  and  for  its  importance are  technical,  even.esoteric, and somewhat difficult to  understand.  But, I consider it to be one of the most  significant votes of this session. At stake  is not really a question of the number of  dollars  to be spent on highways. The  gentleman who just preceded me in the  well suggested in his argument that the  dollar ceiling was arbitrary. I say to the  Members that they are the farthest from  an arbitrary ceiling that we could pos sibly have, because the limitation on this  bill is the amount estimated at the time  as the maximum that could be reason ably utilized by the states. I would sug gest that the limitation was imposed by  this Congress on these expenditures last  year, and I have not heard a single sug gestion that a single highway program  was  impaired by the existence of that  ceiling.  Indeed,  the chairman of  the  subcommittee of the Committee on Pub lic Works admitted very  frankly and  honestly in the well a few minutes ago  that this was not so.  Mr. HOW ARD. Mr. Speaker, will the  gentleman yield?  ",1976
262,House,94,-0.431,701,20,Mr. HOWARD.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I misunderstood the gen tleman's question. The gentleman was  asking me whether the limit in this bill  had ever been exceeded in expenditures  in other years, and the answer to that  was ""Yes,'' it certainly has. The States  were able to use $7.8 to $7.9 billion in  fiscal year 1975. I had misunderstood the  question.  ",1976
263,House,94,0.27,701,20,Mr. CEDERBERG.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of the position of the gentle man from California <Mr. McFALL) and  the  ranking minority member of  the  committee, the gentleman from Massa chusetts <Mr. CONTE). I believe what we  are dealing with here is the integrity of  the budget process, as already has been  mentioned. I think the Members will re call that the President sent in a budget  of something around $395 billion for this  fiscal year, and then in the wisdom of  the House-or lack of wisdom, which ever one wants to call it-we are up now  to about $413 billion, and that included  the ceiling on the trust fund that we are  talking about here today.  Mr. Speaker, if we break this ceiling,  then I fail  to understand how we can  possibly do anything other than come up  with an increased ceiling in September. I  think it is going to be completely incon sistent for Membe.rs to vote to break this  ceiling and then, in September when it is  essential that the ceiling be increased,  vote against that ceiling.  I did not vote for the earlier ceiling,  and I will probably not vote for the new  ceiling, and I  think it would be a com pletely  inconsistent position  for Mem bers to vote to extend this by an addi tional $4.5 billion.  To be honest with the Members, we  may not spend all of that in the fiscal  year 1977. However, it would be substan tial, and it would require the breaking of  this ceiling by a substantial amount of  money.  Let me say also, Mr. Speaker, that I  believe there are a g.reat many Members  in this body who, when this vote was  taken before, did not really quite under stand what the process was going to be  or what the impact on the budget process  which we have developing here in the  House would be.  So I would urge all my colleagues, espe cially those on my side of the aisle, and  especially  those on  the Committee on  Appropriations-and I believe most of  them  understand what  happened-to  vote for this motion, because it will main tain some semblance of fiscal  integrity.  Breaking this ceiling would be,  in my  opinion, absolutely irresponsible fiscally,  and I think, as a matter of fact, it would  require  the President  of  the United  States to veto this bill if it comes in with out this spending ceiling, because I do not  see how he can possibly stand for another  expenditure of $3 billion  to $4 billion  more  than what we  have  already  committed.

264,,94,-0.462,792,20,Mr. BRADEMAS.," Mr. Speaker, one of  the most  thoughtful  scholars  in our  country is Rene Dubos, professor emer itus at the Rockefeller University in New  York.  I believe that 'Members of the House of  Representatives and Senate will  read  with  interest  the  following article by  Professor Dubos, ""Symbiosis Between the  Earth and Humankind,'' published 1n  the August 6,  1976,  issue of Science  magazine.  The article is adapted from the text  of the lecture he delivered at the first  International Tyler Ecology Symposium  on April 9, 1976 in response to his re ceiving the Tyler Ecology Award, which  is administered by Pepperdine University,  Malibu, Calif. The award was shared with  Charles S. Elton and Abel Wolman.  The article follows:  SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN EARTH AND HUMANKIND  shall  focus my  remarks on  the  creative  aspects of  the  interplay between human  beings and the earth.  I know, of course, that many human in terventions into nature have been destruc tive; history is replete with ecological dis asters. I know also that many industrial and  agricultural practices of our times have dis tressing ecological effects and are likely to  have frightening consequences in the future.  However, I do not find it useful to elaborate  on  these  dangers  because  they  are well  known. Instead of describing the manifesta tions of the ecological crises and of repeating  once more that further environmental degra dation can be minimized only by conserva tion measures.  I  take a more constructive  view of  the  interplay between humankind  and the earth. I shall consider how the prac tices of environmental conservation might be  complemented by prospective policies of en vironmental creation.  For thousands of years, human beings have  been engaged in creative transformations of  the wilderness and of humanized environ ments, but the process has been greatly ac celerated and intensified since the 19th cen tury. One of the psychological effects of the  Industrial Revolution was to encourage the  belief that any kind of change was justified  if it was economically profitable-even if it  caused a degradation of human life and of  environmental quality. During recent dec ades, however,  there have been signs of a  reversal  in this psychological attitude. For  the sake of convenience, I take the middle of  the 20th century as  the watershed in the  social view of the relationships between hu man beings and the earth.  In 1933, the city of Chicago held a World's  Fair to celebrate its hundredth anniversary.  The general theme of the fair was that the  increase  in wealth and in the standard of  living during the ""Century of Progresss"" has  been brought about by scientific technology.  The guidebook to the exhibits had a section  entitled ""Science discovers, Industry applies,  Man conforms,'' and the text proclaimed ""In dividuals, groups, entire races of men fall  into step with ... science and technology.""  There could not be a more explicit state ment of the then preva111ng belief that the  real measure of progress is industrial devel opment, regardless of consequences.  Scientific technology is even more creative  in 1976  than it was  in 1933. Yet, no one  would dare state today that humankind must  conform to, or fall in step with, scientific or  technological dictates. The present view  is  rather that industry must conform to human  nature and be managed within strict ecologi cal constraints. The desire for technological  innovation and for  industrial expansion  ts  now checked by an equally strong concern  for  the long-range consequences of human  interventions into nature.  The following examples illustrate that the  concern  for  social  and  ecological  conse  quences  ls not  incompatible with creative  human interventions into natural systems.  ARTIFICIAL ECOSYSTEMS IN THE TEMPERATE ZONE  Among people of Western civ111zation, the  English are commonly regarded as having a  highly developed  respect and appreciation  of nature; but the English landscape, admir able as it is, is far different from what it was  in the state of wilderness. It is not the native  landscape, only one which has become famil iar because it has been progressively shaped  from the primeval forest by centuries of hu  man intervention. Roadsides and riverbanks  are trimmed and grass-verged, trees no longer  obscure the views but appear to be within  the horizon,  foregrounds contrast properly  with middle  distances  and  backgrounds.  Much of the English landscape is indeed so  humanized that it might be regarded as a  park or a vast ornamental farm.  ",1976
265,House,94,0.188,805,20,Mr. HARSHA.," Mr. Chairman,  there  have been all sorts of rumors around as  one would expect about the Nuclear Fuel  Assurance Act and the intention of the  administration as  to what it shall do  insofar  as  the  ""add-on""  facility  at  Portsmouth, Ohio,  is  concerned.  To  clarify the administration's position, I  have received a letter from the President  of the United States and I herewith in clude it in my remarks:  THE WHITE HOUSE,  Washingt °"""", July 29, 1976.  Hon. WILLIAM H. HARSHA,  U.S. H<YUse of Representatives,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR BILL:  I undel'Stand that you have a  concern about our intentions to build the  enrichmen;t f<S.Cllity add-on a.t Portsmouth,  Ohio. I can assure you that in rtlhe context of  the Nuclear Fluel Assmance Act, it is ouir firm  intention, subject, of course, to the compleon the Bingham amendment July 30, it  appears that the major objection to H.R.  8401 as. reported is  the loan guarantee  provision. The House heard  the argu ment that H.R. 8401 ""represents an un healthy precedent of excessive Federal  subsidy."" I submit that H.R. 8401  rep resents no such precedent. There are  several areas of the private sector which  the Federal Government already pro vides subsidies. I do not believe that the  loan guarantees provided  for  in H.R.  8401 are really that much different than  the subsidies provided  to  the railroads  and PanAm Airlines  for  example. To  imply that this Congress is against set ing subsidy precedents is a misrepresen tation of the facts. Must I  remind the  Congress of the precedent set last Decem ber in giving Federal loans to New York  City? In fact, the Congress provided loan  guarantees  for new underground coal  mines in section 102 of the Energy Con servation and Oil Policy Act of 1975,  Public Law 94-163. The loan guarantee  provision, as set forth in H.R. 8401, is not  unique, nor does it establish a precedent.  If we are to accept the arguments ex pressed by the supporters of  the Bing ham amendment, it is not clear why an  amendment was not offered to simply de lete the loan guarantee provisions of the  bill as reported instead of gutting the  measure almost entirely. In fact,  it  is  not even clear why the loan guarantee  provision of  the bill has attracted so  much attention unless there is an under lying reason which the supporters of the  Bingham amendment do not wish to de bate openly. The loan guarantee merely  acts as a warranty on already proven  technology. I do not understand why so  many Members of Congress are upset  with Federal warranties when we de mand warranties from the private sector  for 'their products. The House was also  told on Friday that the Bingham amend ment was not an antinuclear amend ment.  In my opinion, the underlying reason  for  support of  the Bingham amend ment is that some Members of Congress  do not want to use nuclear power  to  meet our future energy needs. Our en ergy situation is, without a doubt,  the  single most important issue with which  thiS Congress must deal. It is perhaps  the most complex, most far reaching,  and most urgent  issue  to which  this  body_ can address  itself. With  this  in  mind,  I do not feel we can afford  to  limit the options the United States has  in determining how to meet our future  energy needs. This  is  the basic  issue  with which this Congress must come to  grips.  The United States  faces a  serious,  and continuing, energy problem caused  by increased and undue reliance on im ported oil and the lack of readily avail able energy alternatives.  I would  like  to  remind  the Congress of President  Ford's State of the Union message of   1975 in which he enunciated three na tional energy policy goals necessary for  the Nation to regain energy independ ence. These goals, which he reiterated  in his 1976 energy message are: First,  to halt our growing dependence on imtion of  the required environmental proce dures, 1to complete that plant.  Moreover, rthe PortiSmouth plant does noit  conflict with other additions l1io oua: enrich ment capacity and our progress on it will not  depend upon completion of any other facil1rtlies.  I hope that :these commentiS give you the  assUI'la.nces thMi you require.  Sincerely,  GERALD R. FORD.  Mr. Hll.LIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the Bingham amendment.  I !believe th:at there are really two issues  which the House is debating today. The  first issue is whether or not we should  allow private industry to build uranium  enrichment plants and the second issue,  and perhaps the most important, is the  underlying question of whether or not we  are willing to provide an adequate supply  of energy for the future growth and eco nomic well-being of the United States.  I do not believe that thos:e who oppose  the passage of H.R. 8401, as reported, do  so simply because they oppase the private  sector of our economy getting involved  in uranium enrichment plants or 'because  they object to the use of loan guarantees  by the Federal Government. 'It is obvious  to me that passage of 1this measure will  reduce the future !budget of the Federal  Government by billions of dollars .. There  are adequate safeguards in this bill  to  protect 1Jhe United States from the mis use, or careless use, of nuclear technol ogy. The bill is designed to give the Con gress an active role in determining which  corporations will be awarded contracts  to build the enrichment plants. I com mend the Joint Committee, and its chair man, Senator PASTORE, and its vice chair man, Congressman PRICE, for 1their fine  work in these areas.  Historioally, the United States has re lied upon private industry to develop and  provide needed energy  resources. Our  free ente:riprise system demands that this  practice be continued. Private industry  is prepared ito take reasonable risks, has  the flexilbility, the investment funds, and  the managerial capabilities to build and  operate  urianium  enrichment  plants  effectively.  In ""A National Plan for Energy Re search, Development,  and Demonstra tion-Creating Energy Choices for the  Future,"" recently published by ERDA ERDA states that-A basic premise in national energy policy  and planning for R.D. & D. is that the pri vate sector has the primary role in creating .  new energy alternatives;  the  federal gov ernment's role is to assist the .private sector  in the development and market penetration'  of new energy technologies.  It is  the rightful place for  the pri vate sector of our economy to get active ly  involved  in  uranium  enrichment  plants. The Federal Government should  play a  supplementary  role of sharing  risks, conducting R.D. & D. programs,  and developing general energy policies.  H.R. 8401 as reported appropriately de fines the roles of both the public 1and pri vate sectors in the area of uranium en richment plants.  I am fully aware that there are several  Members who would disagree with me  on this point. Studying the House debate  ",1976
266,House,94,0.342,818,20,Mr. DERWINSKI.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. TAYLOR).  ",1976
267,House,94,0.328,818,20,Mr. TAYLOR of Missouri.," Mr. Chair man, this legislation is unnecessary, and  should be rejected outright.  H.R. 4634 would statutorily set a 54hour weekly tour of duty for Federal fire fighters and would esta.blish their legal  entitlement to premium pay for standby  duty at the maximum percentage allowed  by law, 25 percent.  This would be  inconsistent with  the  existing practices of agencies adminis tratively determining the hours of work  of their employees and of the Civil Serv ice Commission establishing by regula tion the rates of premium pay for vary ing tours of duty.  This would establish the Federal fire fighters as a favored class of employees  separate from other Federal employees  who perform  standby duty. Reducing  their tour of duty from 72 hours to 54  hours without reducing their pay would  amount  to a 33%-percent  increase  in  the rate of pay for Federal firefighters.  There is no basis for maintaining the  higher rate of premium pay if the tours  of duty are reduced. Rather, the percent age rate of premium pay should also be  reduced to new percentage rates in which  firefighters would qualify under Commis sion regulations.  This would be no different than a night  shift employee being reassigned  to the  day shift and losing the night shift dif ferential or an employee returning from  a  foreign area where a  cost-of-living  allowance was authorized.  Federal firefighters presently receive  adequate compensation  for  the duties  they perform. Section 5303 of  title 5,  United States Code, provides for the pay ment of special rates higher than those  provided  under  the  general  schedule  when the Civil Service Commission finds  that pay rates for an occupation in a  particular area are so substantially above  the Federal pay rates as  to handicap  significantly the Government's recruit ment and retention of well-qualified per sonnel i;n this occupation.  The necessity to establish special rates  is thus a good indicator of whether or not  Federal  ,compensation  practices-pay  and  hours--compete  favorably  with  those of other employers at any given  time.  I believe that the fact that no area  withb1 the contiguous 48 States currently  warrants special rates for firefighters is  persuasive  evidence  that  the  current  combination of base pay and annual  premium pay for standby duty is ade quate compensation for their present 72hour weekly tour of duty.  A recent review of  the classification  and pay practices  in  the Federal and  non-Federal sectors conducted by  the  Civil Service Commission indicates that  firefighters' duties in Federal and non Federal activities are similar and that  Federal firefighters are paid at higher  rates  than their non-Federal counter parts.  A comparison of salaries paid to mu nicipal firefighters in cities of 10,000 or  more as reported in the Municipal Year book of 1975, salary data as of January  1, 1974, with the salary levels-including  the 25-percent differential for a 72-hour  tour of duty-for Federal firefighters in  effect in January 1974, reveals that ttie  average minimum and maximum pay  levels for Federal firefighters was some what higher than the national average of  minimum and maximum pay levels for  municipal firefighters. The rate for GS-4,  step 1-the entry level for experienced  firefighters-was 7 percent higher than  the average entrance salary for munic ipal firefighters and the average of step  10 rates for GS-4 and GS-5 was 15 per cent higher than the average maximum  municipal salary.  This comparison of salaries as of Jan uary 1974 does not, however, include the  effect of the additional overtime pay due  Federal firefighters as of January 1975  under the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Adding  this approximately 8-percent  increase in total salary to the salaries  of Federal firefighters and assuming the  same relative differences in salaries from  January 1974 to January 197,5 indicates  that experienced Federal firefighters now  are paid approximately 15 percent higher  minimum salaries and approximately 25  percent higher maximum salaries than  are paid to municipal firefighters.  Mr. Chairman, the facts strongly argue  against enactment of  this unjustified  legislation.  ",1976

At  present, the more than 12,500 firefighting  personnel who are employed by the Fed eral Government work on the average  72-hours each week, consisting of three  24-hour shifts. In reducing their work week to an average of 54 hours per week,  this legislation makes the schedules of  firefighters consistent with the nonover time tour of duty established for them  under the Fair Labor Standards Amend ments of 1974 and consistent with the  tours of duty established for most munic ipal firefighters throughout the country.  Under current law, most Federal fire fighters qualify for  the maximum per centage allowable by law-25 percent based on their present 72-hour per week  tour of duty. The annual premium pay  is paid in lieu of overtime, night dif ferential, Sunday, and holiday pay. For  irregular, unscheduled hours in excess of  72-hours per week, firefighters are paid  overtime  compensation  in  accordance  with  the provisions of  title 5, United  States Code.  According to the committee's findings,  Federal firefighters are subject  to  the  overtime provisions of  the Fair Labor  Standards Amendments of 1976. As such,  overtime payme;nt for all hours in excess  of 58 per week is required and most fire fighters did receive some overtime during  1976.  H.R. 4634  in prescribing an average  54-hours workweek continues to author ize the payment of 25 percent of annual  premium pay and also provides that for  irregular, unscheduled hours of duty in  excess of the average 54-hours per week,  firefighters will be entitled to overtime  pay.  Al though the pay of the Federal fire fighter is not being charlged by this leg islation, the requirement of a 54-hour  workweek, by itself, will have no infla tionary impact on the national economy.  As a member of the Post Office and  Civil Service Committee which favorably  reported this legislation to the floor of  the House of Representatives 'by a  re corded vote of 16 yeas-1 nay and 1 pres ent on April 29, 1976, I ask my distinguished colleagues to joirl in correcting  this inequity by reducing the workweek  of our invaluable Federal firefighters and  permitting them to continue their fine  service.

270,House,94,0.08,831,20,Mr. CARTER.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, during the years I have  served in the House I have cosponsored  and supported clean air  legislation.  I  want to see, as much as any man or  woman here, continuation of responsible  Federal efforts assisting in realizing our  goal of a clean environment. I supported  observance of the national primary and  secondary air quality standards estab lished by the Clean Air Act of 1970 as  determined by the Environmental Pro tection Agency.  Primary standards, of course, protect  the public health of the people of our  Nation. The secondary standards pro tect  the environment and certainly  I  want to have an adequate margin of pro tection there. My support of Federal and  State efforts to see that the standards  are  attained  and mainained  is  not  changed by my objections  to certain  amendments in this bill.  I do not believe that H.R. 10498 re flects adequate consideration of the pre dicament in which many Americans find  themselves 'today. Consumers are upset  over the rising cost of their utility bills.  My feeling  is  that I am not the only  Member here who has heard these calls  for help.  In fact,  the  senior Senator  from Pennsylvania  submitted a proposal not long ago for a  passthrough for  increases of power  to  be paid out of the Federal Treasury fo:r  those who were on fixed incomes. Many  Members remember that. Many constitu ents throughout the area of some of the  Members  have  complained  of  high  utility bills and I wonder if there is a  Member here who has not had that com plaint from his constituents. If there is,  I would like to see him.  The bills are going up and we know  that. Just a few days ago one of my black  friends  showed me a  bill  for $104  a  month. This happened to be a lady, with  her husband,  on  a  fixed  income  of  $251.80. How can she live and pay that  much?  This legislation, unless amended fur ther, Mr. Chairman, will mean a 33% percen  increase in the cost of power to  residents of my State. I _have evidence  here  from  the East Kentucky Power  stating just that.  Also Mr. Aubrey J. Wagner, chairman  of the board of TV A, has advised me on  two separate occasions  that  this pro posal will mean  an  expenditure  by  TV A-and I hope those who live in the  Tennessee Valley hear  this-and will  cause an  initial  expenditure of  $300  million and an expenditure of $200 mil lion for every year  in  the foreseeable  future.  The Environmental Protection Agency  in its report of February 25 has con cluded that the concept of ""significant  deterioration provision"" together with a  new set of standards  in  the bill will  result  in approximately $28 biilion  in  additional costs to the electrical utility  industry alone between now and 1990.  Now,  this is a far cry from what we  have been told of a 3-percent increase  in cost. This not in accordance with the  facts which I have received and which  I have here now at this time.  Mr. Chairman, this legislation would  divide our country into three different  areas: Class 1: a pristine area. I cer tainly support that. This is our parks  and wild river areas and such as that.  I am very supportive of the cleanest air  possible for such areas.  Class 2:  Areas such as where I  live  at the present time, which is one which  is relatively clean. The only pollution we  get there is pollution blown over from  the areas west of us to amount to any thing; but this committee, in its wisdom,  if we want to call it that, has reduced  or made more stringent the pollution  standards in class 2 areas by 10 percent;  that is, in C!ase of primary standards if  we are permitted 100 milligrams of pol lution per cubic meter, then in this area  it is  reduced  to 90 milligrams, which  would -be  90  percent,  an  increased  stringency  in  these  regulations  in an  area which is already relatively clear.  Now,  the purpose of this, Mr. Chair man, is to keep industry from coming  into that area, not just to clean up the  air. Cleaner air is not the first purpose  at all.  Now, we have a class 3 area and here  is where we deviate from  the normal.  We have made less stringent the regu lations than in class 2 areas.  Now, in the dirty areas, in the manu facturing areas, we  loosen  the stand ards 15 pe:cent;  that is,  if  they are  permitted 100 milligrams per cubic meter  of pollution in a class 3 area, and my  good friend, the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. MADDEN)  lives  in such an area,  Hammond and Gary, Ind., and that area,  the dirty air would be permitted to in crease to 115 milligrams for every cubic  meter. This  is not cutting  the scale  across the board and acting fairly, as it  should.  Mr. Chairman, this is not a good bill.  It is not fair to the people of our coun try. Not only that, a class 3 area starts  out here in Delaware and goes up the  eastern coast to New York and there  we have the nitrosamines that my good  friend has talked about. In that area  it would not diminish those nitrosa:qiines  one bit. This area, called ""Cancer Alley""  would still be able to exceed the levels  permitted by 15 percent and would still  retain the name of Cancer Alley and re tain its high incidence of cancer. The  only way to do this is for us to fix the  primary  and  secondary  standards  as  they should be;  first,  to protect  the  public health of this Nation, fix  them  as they should be fixed.  Second, to fix the secondary standards  as they should be and that is to protect  the environment. This, Mr. Chairman,  I want to say, we are not doing.  As we get down to the cost of  this  legislation, as it was brought in, I want  to read a letter from the State of Qhio.  We are told that the Governors of the  States opposed this, but I went to the  utility commissions, the people who know  the cost of the utility bills to our con stituents and  this  is what  they state  in this instance:  I  am of  .the belief  that some environ mental :protection controls are a necessity,  but the imposition of such rigid rules only  tend  to  threaten  the  utilities'  financial  sta.blllty a.nd  to  increase  the monthly blll  the consumer pays.  That  is  from C. Luther Heckman,  chairman of the State of Ohio Public  Utilities Commission.  All right, the State of South Carolina:  The  average South Carolina.  residential  electric blll  for .July, 1973, was $22.58, as  compared to $33.12 for July, 1975. This shows  an increase in two years of $12.00. The aver age kilowatt hour usage for July, 1973, was  $10.59, as .compared to $10.00 for July, 1975.  Of course, they expect a great increase  when  the new  technology  is  in place.  Now,  from  the State of  Indiana,  the  average residential electric bills for the  five investor-owned utilities in the State  of Indiana for July 1973 was $18. 76. In  July 1975, this rate had gone up to $23.85.  It is estimated that to obtain the best  available technology, the cost to the State  of Indiana will be $1 billion if scrubbers  are required, and will cost an additional  $350 million in operating costs. The fig ures available  for scrubber  technology  were 'as of June 13, and it is estimated  that there has been an increase of ap proximately $25 per kilowatt-hour for  capital expenditures.  The Members can see that every State  in the Union is going to be involved, and  every one of the Members' constituents is  going to be involved. We can maintain  our primary and secondary standards for  clean a.ir, and yet if we amend this legis lation to do away with these ridiculous  amendments that are presently before us,  we  can  save  the  consumers  of  our  country a great deal.  Now, we get down to the good State of  Florida and the Florida Public Service  Commission. I do not know how the Gov ernor feels about this, but the commis sioner states:  Enclosed is a.n attachment containing the  information you have requested, and if we  can be of further assistance, don't hesitate  to contact us.  All  right,  the Florida Power Co.  in  July 1973, the average bill for the month  was $26.92. In 1975, it had gone up to  $40.57-$15, over 50 percent in those 2  years. And, we are going to tack onto that  25 to 30 percent more at least per year.  The distinguished commissioner says:  Tampa. Electric Company has projected  that the cost of scrubber technology in terms  of 1975 dollars would be 92 cents per kilo watt hour. This would  translate  into an  increase of $9.20 per month for the average  residential consumer.  to  Nine dollars more a month for every  resident in the Tampa area of Florida.  Now, are we willing  increase those  prices for all those constituents? This is  going to go on through the United States.  in every State, in every congressional dis trict.  I would hope  that we would so  amend this legislation as to not increase  the price to each homeowner, each per",1976

And you can tell a lot about the  Ford  administration by  this and  the  strip-mine veto.  One of the great things about the con servation movement, one of  the great  things about our policy toward treatment  of the land in the country and our re sources has been that it has been a bi partisan movement.

275,House,94,-0.225,857,20,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Chairman, a  situation now exists in Denver and other  high-a~titude areas of the country where  the letter of the Clean Air Act is being  obeyed, but its spirit is being violated.  As  incongruous as it may seem, cars  in  high-altitude  areas  which  are  equipped with emission control devices  are polluting more  than  they would  without the devices. Emission control de vices are geared to sea  level operation  and, when used at sea  level,  function  efficiently. At high altitudes, however,  they run extremely  fuel-rich and ac tually emit up to twice the amount o1  pollutants as a well  tuned car at sea  level. For cities such as Denver, which  Mr. WIRTH and I  represent, Salt Lake  City, and Albuquerque, this results in the  waste of millions of gallons of gasoline,  with cars emitting more pollutants than  they would without the emission control  devices.  I find it ironic that several States, in cluding Colorado, are forced by the Fed eral Government to accept more pollut ants jn the air than they would other wise have. It is obviously impossible for  high-altitude States  to meet Federal  ambient air standards if the devices re quired to help meet those standards ac tually cause twice the pollution, simply  because they cannot be adjusted to the  proper setting for the higher altitudes.  Unsatisfactory emission control per formance can be corrected, but auto  dealers are prohibited from making such  adjustments by the antitampering pro vision of the Clean Air Act, which carries  a $10,000 penalty for its violation. Deal ers are only permitted to make adjust ments within manufacturer's specifica tions, which do not compensate for high  altitude-. The dealer's hands are  tied.  The only way dealers could make such  adjustments would be to run long mile age tests and submit the results to the  Environmental  Protection  Agency EPA-for possible approval-an impos sible task for small businessmen. More over, auto dealers, who are probably best  able  to  satisfactorily  adjust  emission  control devices, are the only ones that  are singled out and prevented from doing  so. The service station on the corner,  Joe's garage down the street, as well as  the  individual car owner, are all per mitted to adjust emission control devcies.  In many cases,  these adjustments are  done in a less than satisfactory manner.  The individual car owner, in particular,  often relies on one of the many do-it yourself kits on the market, for which  there  is absolutely no standardization.  The, auto dealer's situation could be  solved, however, by  the manufacturer.  Manufacturers  can develop  high-alti tude modifications for certified vehicles  of earlier model-year designations and  get approval from EPA for such modi fications relatively easily. The only re quirement is that the manufacturer in stall the modifications on a vehicle with  stabilized missions-that  is,  a  vehicle  that has been operated  for  the basic  4,000-mile stabilization period-and that  he then demonstrate that, when modi fied,  the  vehicle  can meet  emission  standards at high altitudes. In the vast  majority of cases, the only change that  is needed to allow a vehicle to meet emis sion  standards at high altitudes  is  a  change in carburetor and ignition cali brations.  The fact that there is a procedure by  which the manufacturer can readily ob tain approval for high-altitude modifica tions for earlier model-year cars, how ever, does not mean  the manufacturer  will elect  to make such modifications.  Auto dealers in the Denver area have re quested  this assistance, citing the tre mendous good will and public welfare of  ",1976

FOURTH OF  JULY BICENTENNIAL  MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT  HON. JOHN J. RHODES  OF ARIZONA  to  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, August 4, 1976  ",1976
278,,94,0.225,1091,20,Mr. RHODES.," Mr. Speaker, our Nation  celebrated a gala Fourth of July weekend  which gave appropriate recognition  the momentous milestone of 200 years as  a free Republic.  President Ford presented a thoughtful  Bicentennial message on July 3 in the  Oabinet room, in which he summed up  the essence of our greatness as a nation  as being  the dedication  to  individual  rights. As many of my colleaghes were  out of town, I herewith ask permission  insert  the President's inspiring re marks in the RECORD. Text of the message  is as follows:  (Office of the White House Press Secretary]  to  FOURTH OF JULY BICENTENNIAL MESSAGE OJ'  THE PRESIDENT  Two hundred years ago we, the people of  the United States of America, began a great  adventure which stirred the imagination and  quickened  the hopes of men and women  throughout the world. The date was July 4,  1776. The occasion, the signing of our Dec laration of Independence.  No other nation in h~story has ever dedi cated itself more specifically nor devoted it self more completely to the proposition that  all men are created equal, that they are en dowed by their creator with such unalien able rights of life,  liberty and the pursuit  of happiness.  Two centuries later, as we celebrate our  Bicentennial year of Independence, the great  American adventure continues. The hallmark  .of that adventure has always been an eager ness to explore the unknown, whether it lay  across an ocean or a continent, a.cross the  vastness of space or the frontiers of human  knowledge. Because we have always been  ready to try new and untested enterprises in  government, in commerce, in the arts and sci ences and in human relations, we have made  unprecedented progress in all of these fields ..  Whtie reaching for the unknown, Ameri cans have also kept their faith in this wis dom and experience of the past. Colonists  and  immigrants brought with  them cher ished values and ideals  in religion and in  culture, in law and learning which, mixed  with the native American ways, gave us our  rich American heritage.  The unique American union of the known  and the unknown, the tried and the untried  has been the foundation for our liberty and  the secret of our great success. In this coun try  individuals can be  the masters rather  than the helpless victims of their destiny. We  can make our own opportunities and make  the most of them.    In the 1!5pace of two centuries we have not  been able to right every wrong,  to correct  every injustice, to reach every worthy goal,  but for 200 years we have tried and we will  continue to strive to make the lives of in dividual men and women in this country and  on this earth better lives-more hopeful and  August 4, 1976  happy, more prosperous and peaceful, more  fulfilling and more free. This is our common  dedtcation and it will be our common glory  as we enter the third century of the Ameri can adventure.  UNITED STATES MUST SUPPORT  -SOUTH KOREA  HON. WILLIAM L. DICKINSON  OF ALABAMA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, August 4, 1976  ",1976
279,,94,0.398,1091,20,Mr. DICKINSON.," Mr. Speaker, in the  Monday, July 26, edition of the Birming ham News there appeared an editorial  entitled ""The Repression Gambit."" In  detail this editorial outlines the reasons  why we must not let South Korea down,  and examines  the repression ploy  the  liberals are using against South Korea.  Because I feel this is one of the most in telligent,  convincing, well-written and  relevant discussions of United States South Korea relations, I am happy to in sert that editorial at this point in the  RECORD:  THE REPRESSION GAMBIT  One way or another the charge of ""repres sion"" or ""authoritarianism"" or ""corruption""  has been used against every government op posed by Communists in the history of the  Red movement.  The charge was used against Chiang Kai shek's Chinese government;  it was  used  against successive Vietnamese leaders; it was  used against Cambodia's Lon Nol;  it was  used against Franco; and it is being used  against Chile,  the Phllippines and South  Korea.  It may be that a measure of truth adds  credibility to each charge. But there are de grees of  repression, authoritarianism, etc.,  and the ultimate loss of freedom is under  the alternative of Communism.  South Korea, specifically, is under attack  now. Some members of Congress want  to  cut off military assistance to the government  of President Park Chung Hee. The House on  June 2 reversed an earlier vote by the Inter national Relations Committee which . had  favored cutting aid  to South Korea. Un doubtedly the issue will arise again .  Eventually the South Koreans will be self suffi.cient mllitarily. Until  then, assistance  by the U.S. helps deter Communist aggres sion.  If this country doesn't prematurely  sink that country,, eventually it will be able  to swim by itself.  It is easy for people in this country to  be critical of the government of South Korea.  But if we were separated only by a demili tarized border  from a hostile enemy--say  the Soviet Union-which continually made  threats,  constantly  sent  agents  into our  country to spy and subvert our citizei;is, and  which vowed the ultimate destruction of our  way of life, we might not 'be as open as we  are or as tolerant of dissent of our govern ment.  To a nation, the first order of priority is  survival. It is not difficult to understand wh'9  in South Korea all the trappings of democ racy might be an unaffordable luxury.  And 1f we  establish  rules of  the game  which rule out tough internal security meas-  ures, we  force South Korea  to open  itself  to the enemy.  It should be kept in mind also  that it  is pressure  from  the Communists which  makes the security measures necessary-and  that the Communists are the first to charge  their targets of aggression with ""repression""  if their subversion is checked.  ",1976
280,,94,0.133,1104,20,Mr. SARASIN.," Mr. Speaker, in spite  of the growing chorus of voices speak ing out on  the undesirable economic  and practical consequences of breaking  up the oil industry, there are still those  who seek to obtain political mileage from  the public suspicion of ""big oil.""  These calls for divestiture are not based  on reasoned analysis of the nature or the  operation of the petroleum industry, but  on demagogic appeals to emotions. They  represent an unworthy effort by some to  find a scapegoat for a situation that is in  part the fault of this very Congress. The  heart of the problem is not the size of  the oil companies, but the failure of Con gress to adopt a strong and effective en ergy Policy.  Fortunately,  there  is  increasing evi dence that the media and the general  public realize  this fact. I know  in my  Connecticut district this is true and more  and more voices of  reason are being  heard throughout the country.  I would like to share with you a partic ularly cogent and articulate statement of.  the issue as stated in the Hartford Cou rant of August 1, which I hope each of my  colleagues will take the time to read:  No MODE FOR OIL CLAMPS  Breaking up the nation's 18 largest oil com panies  into separate units for production,  marketing, refining and transportation is a  topic that has been vigorously mulled and de bated  for months. Literally hundreds  of  thousands of words and arresting claims have  been marshalled in' support of and in op position to the proposal, and the ena is no where in sight. Basically, it is a matter of  'attitudes toward bigness-is bigness in and  of itself benign or baneful?  As is often the case with efforts to reduce  complexities to basics, oversimplification re sults. Expert proponents and opponents obvi ously are not concerned only with the enorm ity of certain oil companies. Their arguments  are  fraught with  economic  pluses  and  minuses which ma.y or may not relate to size.  Still, we repeat,  it all comes down  to the  question whether its size makes Big Oil good  or bad. We see its positive side.  Admittedly it is difficult to view the ques tion dispassionately, wrapped up as it is with  economic interpretations and human appli cations. In the insecurity of our relatively  small individualism, we have built-in urges to  cut  large  forces  and  shapes outside our  sphere down  to size. Big Government, Big  Labor, Big Oil;  they all cast fearsome shad ows. So also do many other shapes whose sub stance often proves less terrifying than the  image projected. It's a matter of light, angle  and perspective.  Ag&t.n basically and simpl1st1cally, Senate  ",1976
281,,94,0.342,1117,20,Mr. DERWINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, as a  longtime, impartial observer of the na tional political scene, I am somewhat dis mayed by the lack of attention being ac corded to a slowly but steadily escalating  saga which would add a fascinating chap ter to our political history.  In the past, I have had little difficulty  in recognizing the value of priorities in volved in gathering and disseminating the  news. Now, however, I am somewhat puz zled by the news media's dilemma in try i]1.g, on an almost around-the-clock basis,  to unravel and interpret the pre-conven tion vote strengijl of  the  two  reputed  principal contenders for the Republican  Presidential nomination.  Evidently, the news media knows there  is nationwide  interest  in whether  the  convention delegate from West Worth ington Falls is tilting to President Ford  or Ronald Reagan. For me, it conjures  up memories of the old Abbott and Cos tello routine of ""Who's on First.""  In moving delegates iilto and out of  the Ford and Reagan columns, the news  media still must tell us what effect Sen ator RICHARD  SCHWEIKER will have on  Reagan's chances for  the nomination.  Who will Ford tap  to be his running  mate? In alphabetical order it could be  Ambassador Anne Armstrong, Senator  . HAROLD E. STASSEN,  Philadelphia, Pa., July 19, 1976.  Congressman EDWARD J. DERWINSKI,  Longworth House Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN DERWINSKI: Now that  all of  the Republican delegates have been  elected, and it appears that neither of the  two campaigners have a majority of the dele gates, may I  respectfully write to you per sonally to invite your consideration; if you  are uncommitteed, of a vote for me on the  first ballot; and if you are commi tteed, of a  vote for me on later ballots if your first bal lot candidate does not succeed.  I am confident that if the admitted near miracle occurs and I am nominated, I can  unite our Republican party and unite the  majority of the American people in Novem ber for an election victory.  But more important, I am confident that  I could lift and lead our country to full em ployment without inflation, and to reestab lish American leadership in the United Na tions and in the world for peace, with devel oping justice and expanding freedom.  Informal samples of opinion taken with  the enclosed ballot  indicate  that fourteen  percent of the voters, who are independents  and democrats, would  swing  from Carter  to me, and this makes the crucial difference  for victory.  It appears that notwithstanding the lack  of a campaign, and notwithstanding the hu mor and ridicule from some of the media,  the people do recognize:  My extensive successful experience in both  domestic and foreign policy;  The fact that I am and have been right  on the great issues of our nation;  The unblemished  record not only per sonally but also for the major administra tions which I have conducted and have been  responsible for, in peace and in war; and  The continuing commitment of fairness to  all and favoritism to none.  The policies and programs which I would  follow would be new and up-to-date and for ward-looking; but they would all be based  on sound,  tried, and tested principles and  broad experience. Some of my Minnesota  friends will be sending you a  copy of my  address to the Minnesota Republican Con vention in June 1976, which gives some con crete details.  May  add that I  have not at any time  personally attacked either President Ford  or Governor Reagan, and I will not do so.  You may easily check on the sentiments  of the independents and democrats in your  community by making copies of the enclosed  ballot and by having someone take an informal ballot box sample.    I will look forward to seeing you at Kan sas City.  With personal best Jishes, as ever,  Sincerely,  I  HAROLD E. STASSEN.  CUBA AND THE PANAMA CANAL  HON. LARRY McDONALD  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, August 4, 1976  Mr. McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, the U.S.  Government faces many problems with  some of the major ones in the field of  foreign policy. Because of the cloak of  secrecy surrounding the operations of our  foreign policymakers, it is often a dif ficult task for Members of Congress to  inform the people of the United States  as to what is actually transpiring .  A highly illuminating story about this  aspect of American politics is a recent  book by Gary Allen entitled ""Kissinger:  The Secret Side of  the Secretary of  State."" Replete with facts, it is an expose  of the House of Rockefeller and the drive  to bring about the merging of the United  States  into  the  so-called New World  Order. As such, the book, published by  the '76 Press, Post Office Box 2686, Seal  Beach, calif., 90740, should be read by  every American, especially Members of  the Congress.  Chapter 7 of the book entitled, ""Be traying Freedom  in Latin America""  is  most timely in presenting the two key  problems of the Western Hemisphere:  CUba and the Panama Canal.  The indicated chapter follows as part  of my remarks:  BETRAYING FREEDOM  IN LATIN AMERICA  The Nixon campaign rhetoric in 1968 prom ised a hard line against Communist excur sions in the Western Hemisphere. But as 1n  so many cases in the Nixon Era, while the  conservatives got the rhetoric, the Liberals  got all of the action. When Rockefeller agent  Henry Kissinger was installed as adviser on  national security affairs, it became apparent  that ""holding firm"" meant giving the Com  munists almost everything they wanted, just  as quickly as public opinion would allow.

283,House,94,0.209,1143,20,Mrs. PETTIS.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 9719, legislation  which would authorize payments to State  or local governments for the loss of taxes  they have  experienced due  to public  lands located within their boundaries.  Mr. Chairman,  the House  Interior  Committee, Subcommittee on Energy and  the Environment held 4 days of public  hearings on  this proposal  in order  to  establish a solid record for the need of  such payments. These hearings confirmed  the findings of the Public Land Law Re view Commission-which in 1970, after  completion of over 6 years of study on  the problem, issued its historic report en titled ""One-Third of the Nation's Land.""  This report included the recommenda tions of the Commission, one of which  was that a Federal payment system be  established and that ""the United States  make payments in lieu of taxes for the  burdens  imposed upon State and local  governments by reason of  the Federal  ownership of public lands.""  Mr. Chairman, there is no doubt in my  mind  that such payments are  indeed  necessary, however,  there are  those in  this Chamber who have stated that this  is another Government ""rip-off"" and a  waste of the taxpayers' money. I  think  those Members should take the time to  review the subcommittee's hearings and  take into account certain facts.    Facts such as these:  (1) Approximately one-third of the Nation  is federally owned and that as a  result of  the  landmark Supreme Court decision of  McCulloch vs. Maryland,  taxation by  the  States, or a subdivision thereof, is an inter ference with the Federal sovereignty.  (2)  In the past, the Congress has estab lished programs in order to compensate local  governments somewhat for Federal impact,  but, in general, the revenues that result do  not amount to what would be received from  property taxes.  (3)  In some cases,  the counties are re stricted to the use of payments to specific  purposes, which  from  the  standpoint  of  effective county management is restrictive.  (4)  In many cases the payments are re ceived by the state and is not passed down  to the county or local government where the  real burden of Federal land exists.  (5) The  total revenue which either the  state or county government may receive  is  not necessarily influenced by the total num ber of acres of Federal land that may exist  within its boundaries.  (6) Exis,ting revenue sharing programs that  have been enacted in piecemeal fashion over  the years are inadequate in most instances  and have not kept pace with  increasing  financial needs in these jurisdictions.  (7) The revenues produced from Federal  lands do not always bear any relationship to  the actual market value of the land from  which revenue is derived.  (8) The present statutes have many ""illog ical"" restrictions:  (a) counties restricted to the use of pay ments  for  specific  purposes;  i.e.  roads,  schools.  (b)  payments  are  either made  to  the  county or the state and are sometimes man dated that they be passed to the county.  (c)  the formula for the payments varies  from statute to statute, oftien being favorable  to some counties and not to others.  Mr. Chairman, these are but a few of  the facts that the subcommittee brought  to light. However, these facts represent a  real problem that must be dealt with by  the local governments where the Federal  property exists. The two counties I repre sent have some 10,179,531 acres of Fed eral land under the Interior and Agricul ture Departments'  jurisdiction  alone  and have experienced many of  these  problems.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 9719 has as  its  building block experiences of two exten sive studies, countless numbers of con gressional hearings-both this Congress  and the 93d Congress-and hundreds of  hours of research and investigation by  the various Federal agencies and Depart ments. H.R. 9719 represents the best pos sible compromise and  I urge my col leagues to support its passage and put an  end to this inexcusable burden.  Thank you.  The CHAIRMAN. All time has expired.

Mr. Chairman, I take this time to en gage  in a  colloquy with  the majority  and minority.

Mr. Chairman, I  rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amend ment  on  the  following  basis:  This  amendment clearly, as I read it, does not  cover State-owned land in cases where  there is a severance tax on the removal  of  timber or minerals. If it is State owned land on which there is no property  tax paid but the State sells timber on a  stumpage basis or sells minerals on a  severance-tax basis, that revenue would  be lost to the State under this amend ment.  The bill allowed for compensation, but  the amendment takes it away. That is a  very significant source of revenue. I am  not totally certain of the legal status  that this amendment creates, but I am  certain it creates enough of a doubt that  I must oppose the amendment.  ",1976

287,House,94,0.325,1169,20,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Chairman,  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, many steps have been  taken toward a better electoral system.  The bill we consider today, the Pos't Card  Voter Registration Act, is not one of them  however. The 19th amendment guaran teeing women the right to vote, the 24th  amendment abolishing the poll tax, the  civil  rights  laws  and  court decisions  eliminating race as a criterion, the one  man-one vote decision  and  the 26th  b111.  we should listen to the people whose  job it is to administer elections, and re ject this bill. I urge a no vote.  ",1976
288,House,94,0.353,1169,20,Mr. FRENZEL.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  1 minute to the gentleman from Florida  amendment lowering the voting age have  all been positive actions toward a better  and more representative electoral sys tem. Compare these past changes in our  electoral system with the proposal before  us today and we can get a better per spective on  the post card  registration  proposal and see the proposal for what  it really is: a gimmick. I would refer to  it as a cheap gimmick but the fact is  that it will cost at least $50 milliQn and  maybe much, much more.  The real danger in this act is the great  opportunities it presents for widespread  voter fraud. Even with the strong checks  and safeguards we have now there have  been far too many cases of vote fraud in  our recent history. H.R. 11552 provides  for  the general availability of  literally  millions  of  voter  registration  forms.  Hundreds or thousands could easily and  legally be picked up from a post office  by a political faction or special interest  group, used for  large scale frauC:ulent  registration which could then be voted  by absentee ballot on election day.  With post card registration, an indi vidual, real or fictitious, eligible or not,  could register by mail and vote by ab sentee ballot never once being seen by any  election official. Post card registration in  combination  with  absentee  balloting  presents unparalleled opportunities for  fraud.  The effects of such voting fraud could  go far beyond the distortion of election  results. More  fundamentally, .for each  fraudulent vote  that might be cast, a  genuine vote  is cancelled out and an  honest citizen  is effectively disenfran chised. The bill's antifraud provisions  demonstrate that even its sponsors un derstand its open invitation to foul play.  This bill could bring back  the days  when  well-oiled  political  machines  brought the art of vote fraud to perfec tion. During those times, dead men voted  and many vacant lots were claimed as  residences of nonexistent voters. These  practices, of course, were against the law  and a not-so-attractive part of our polit ical history. The bill runs counter to those  reforms which appear to be bringing po litical accountability to our system.  The Congress in recent years has spent  more and more and has created dollars  out of nothing but paper and ink. The  result--inflation. Dollars meant less as  more were introduced without anything  to back them up. I am afraid that the  Congress is now about to do to the vote  what  has  been  done  to  the  dollar.  Through fraud, more votes can be in troduced to the system with no people to  back  them up. This, of course, makes  each real person's vote worth less. This  is nothing more than vote inflation. More  votes with less meaning.  This proposal is an expensive one, not  so much for the actual cost of putting  the concept into operation but for cheap ening one of the most precious  things  Americans have going for them. Is this  the first step toward creation of a sys tem of voting by mail? If so, in view of  present postal difficulties, how long would  it take to conduct an election? Congress  should send this measure back to the po litical dead letter office where it belongs.  Changing election laws in the middle  of ongoing elections is irresponsible and  inexcusable.  ",1976
289,House,94,0.332,1169,20,Mr. BUTLER.," Mr. Chairman,  the  Voter Registration Act significantly in creases the potential for crime through  fraudulent postcard registration.  Traditionally, State and local officials  charged with the responsibility for elec tion registration have required the ap pearance of  the person  registering so  that pertinent questions regarding quali fication can be asked. At the very least,  this requirement assures that an actual  person  is registering. H.R.  11552 elim inates this customary and useful proce dure by providing for the mass-mailing  of post cards soliciting qualified persons  to register to vote in Federal elections.  This ill-conceived concept contains num erous flaws which enhance the potential  for fraud.  First,  the availability of registration  post cards would make it easy for an  unscrupulous  individual  to register  in numerable  times  by  using  fictitious  names. If undetected, this person could  present  himself  to  various  election  boards and vote more than once. Not  only could  registration post cards be  subject to theft and sale for fraudulent  purposes, but the undoubtedly complex  nature of mass-mailings would present  the problem of an overabundance of  post cards traveling through the postal  system. The fear  is made real by  the  disclosure  that election officials of  the  District of Columbia, which has a modi .tied postcard  registration . system,  re cently mailed 64,000 post cards more  than the total number of qualified voters  in the District.  Second,  the administrative problems  associated with  the need  for election  officials to check the veracity of signa tures prior to election day is unthink able. States which have po signature  law, such as Virginia, it will be virtually  impossible to ascertain the accuracy of  the signature of the applicant. The. nec essity to check the veracity of the appli cant will increase the time and cost fac tors-factors which  are  not  readily  abundant in the important business of  voter registration.    Finally, it is conceivable that postcard  registration will result in the fraudulent  disenfranchisement of many honest citi zens. Corrupt party officials could obtain  simply hundreds of blank  registration  post cards and simply by changing the  address could invalidate the registration  of voters of the opposite party without  their knowledge. This was the experience  in Philadelphia between 1937 and 1943.  There should be no desire  to extend  nationwide the potential of this unf or tunate and illegal practice.  Past experience with absentee ballots  should provide warnihg for the increased  potential for fraud by the implimentation  of this bill. The American Civil Liberties  Union and many State and local election  officials have expressed the fear of fraud ulent postcard  registration made pos sible by H.R. 11552. It is a fear that can  be avoided by .the defeat of this bill.  ",1976
290,House,94,-0.396,1182,20,Mr. MORGAN.," Mr. Speaker, on August  4, 1976, the Committee on International  Relations met in open session to consider  House Resolution 1427, a  resolution of  inquiry directing the President to provide  to the House of Representatives certain  information with respect to any payment  made by the United States to influence  Italian politics and with respect to acer tain  agreement made by  the United  States regarding loans to Italy.  By a voice vote, the committee adopted  a motion to lay  the resolution on the  table.  Prior to the motion to lay the resolu tion on the table, a motion was made by  the principal sponsor of the resolution,  the Honorable MICHAEL HARRINGTON, who  is a member of the committee, that, due  to the sensitive nature of the resolution,  the committee go into executive session.  The motion was adopted by a recorded  vote of 20 to 0.  House Resolution 1427 was introduced  on July 27, 1976, by Mr. HARRINGTON and  six cosponsors, and referred to the Com mittee on International Relations.  On July 28, I wrote the President re questing his comments on the resolution.  The executive branch reply was received  on August 3.  the committee met to  On August 4,  consider the resolution.  The executive branch reply was read  to the committee in open session. Sub sequently, in executive session, the com mittee  reviewed  the executive branch  reply and discussed the issues raised in  the resolution.

291,Senate,94,-0.296,1286,20,Mr. JACKSON.," Mr. President, Senator  RrnrcoFF, the chairman of the Govern ment Operations Committee and chair man of  the senate conferees on H.R.  12169, deserves the thanks of the Senate  and a tremendous amount of credit for  his work on this measure under an ex tremely difficult  set of  circumstances.  The Federal Energy Administration and  a bewildering and often contradictory  collection of other political  influences  made this conference almost impossible  to manage. In spite of this situation, and  in spite of the burden of several unwise  and unworkable amendments added on  the floor in both Houses, Senator Rrar COFF was able to extract from the con ference a bill which is far less onerous  and damaging  to  the consumer  than  might have otherwise resulted.  Unfortunately, the final bill is still un acceptable from my point of view, and  I  am,  therefore, not among  the signers  of the conference report.  Mr. President, I oppose adoption of the  conference report on H.R. 12169 because  its positive  features are few,  and  the  damage it does is great-damage to the  consumer and to the oil pricing policy  principles forged over 2 years of intense  effort by the Cong.ress.   Mr. President, this conference report  falls short because in return for the ex tension of a bureaucracy it imposes un justifiable  increased costs on the con sumer. This conference rep0rt raises oil  prices-and pretends  that  these price  increases are justified as an ""incentive""  to production.  The price of domestic oil  is already  far higher than it was in 1973. In the  case of so-called upper-tier oil current  prices under the Energy Policy and Con servation Act, EPCA, are already three  times what they were before the embargo  of 1973. Yet, domestic production con tinues to decline.  The price increases embodied in this  bill only throw more money at an oil in dustry which is already highly profitable.  The profit.s of the top 21 oil companies  rose by 24 percent in the first half of  1976 over the already generous levels of  1975.  There have been many, many state ments in this Senate about the foolish ness of throwing money at social prob lems. Apparently this principle does not  apply in the case of the oil companies.  Without some assurance of production  increases, raising oil prices is simply an other direct contribution to inflation and  higher profit.s. Some people seem to think  that our problems with inflation are over.  I for one do not. I have no intention of  supporting a  proposal  to  raise prices  which has been given no  justification  whatever.  Congress  is  taking  the  initiative  in  raising prices in this bill. Congress will  get-and,  in my  view,  deserve-the  blame.  What do we get from this bill.  An extension of the FEA, an agency  which  is  among  the most political of  the  bureaucracies  in  the  executive  branch;  An  energy  information  amendment  which has been compromised by deletion  of any requirement that the FEA gather  data on the economics of energy-cost.s,  profits,  investments-these  data,  of  course, are at the heart of the real en ergy issues facing the country; and  An  energy  conservation  provision  which has been repeatedly compromised  in the face of administration attacks and  threats and which cannot begin to re coup for consumers the impact of ris ing energy costs.  What have we given up?  By its acceptance of the crude oil pric ing  policy  of  this  bill  the Congress  ignores and repudiates  the procedures  agreed to in the Energy Policy and Con servation Act.  A 10-percent increase in the price of  domestic oil  is guaranteed under H.R.  12169, rather than tying price increases  to the rate of inflation.  Stripper  well  prices-already  the  highest  in the domestic average com posite price-are further increased. Yet  stripper well production  is nearly  in sensitive  to price at  these  levels. The  consumer will pay hundreds of dollars  for each additional barrel of stripper oil  produced as a result of this exemption;  and  The oil  industry, an  industry which  can never get enough, will continue tak ing the consumer on a bit-by-bit basis:  crude oil prices one day, natural gas  prices the next.  Mr. President. I submit that a cost benefit study of this bill would turn up  a negative result for anyone except an  oil company. It is clear where the Ford  administration would stand in a situa tion like this. I know where I stand, too.  ",1976

294,Senate,94,-0.224,1390,20,Mr. CHILES.," Mr. President, I am to day introducing S. 3736, for myself and  Senator STONE to clarify that the intent  of the 1972 amendment.s to the Service  Contract Act is to provide coverage for  all blue and white collar service contract  workers.  This bill is identical to H.R. 14987, in troduced  by  Representative  FRANK  THOMPSON, chairman of the House Labor-Management Subcommittee.  _  Mr. THOMPSON'S reputation  in labor  matters and in upholding the rights of  the American worker needs no elabora tion. He was instrumental in the passage  of the 1972 amendments to the Service  Contract Act and has held four sets of  oversight hearings since that time. Mr.  THOMPSON heid hearings July 20, on the  affect of a recent adverse decision by the  District Court of the United States of the  Middle District of Florida. That decision  ignored the clear-and well-documented  intent of the 1972 Service Contract Act  amendments  and  effectively  removed  coverage for 70,000 to 100,000 service con tract employees nationwide.  This bill would  restore coverage  to  these affected employees and reaffirm the  intent of Congress as it was expressed in  the 1972 amendments.  During the July 20 hearing and during  my own on May 17, questions were raised  about  the plight of professional em ployees and whether coverage should be  extended to include them as well. Mr.  THOMPSON has concluded that such an  extension would not be possible this year.  I personally would support such legisla tion, however, there is unanimity about  restoring coverage to the thousands of  workers adversely affected by the Middle  Court decision, and we have a  respon sibility to act immediately to state again  that it was our intent to cover blue-collar  workers with the 1972 amendments.  There is no doubt that many profes sional employees have had  the  same  wage busting experiences of their blue and white-collar colleagues. Mr. THOMP SON has given me his assurance, in a let ter to me, that he will take up the issue  of coverage for professional employees  promptly during the next session. I am  hopeful that the Senate will see fit  to  follow his lead.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent to have the bill and the letter from  Mr. THOMPSON printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill and  letter were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  s. 3736  Be  it enacted by  the Senate and House  of Representatives of the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That  (a)  section 2(a) of the Service Contract Act of  1965 (41 U.S.C. 351(a)) is amended by strik ing out "", as defined herein,"";  (b)  section 2 (b) of the Service Contract  Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 35l(b)) is amended by  striking out ""as defined herein"".

SUBCOMMITTEE ON  LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS,  Washington, D.C., July 26, 1976.  Hon. LAWTON CHILES,  U.S. Senate  Dirksen Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  MY DEAR SENATOR CHILES: It is with some  regret that I have decided to postpone legis lative action to remedy the defects in the  Service Contracts Act regarding ""professional  employees"".  You and I agreed during your testimony  before my subcommittee  that  this was  a  serious problem, which deserved  remedial  action. But  the hard  legislative  truth  is  that we need a  ""veto proof"" bill, and we  have absolutely no assurances that should  the House and Senate enact the type of Bill  we both desire that it would not be vetoed  at the White House.  I have made this decision after full consul tation with members on both sides of the  aisle here in the House, and after consulta tion with my counterpart in the Senate.  Our plan is to go ahead with a clean, simple  bill correcting the injustice created by the  decision in the Federal Electric Corporation  case. Even President Nixon agreed that the  1972 amendments were  intended  to apply  the Service Contract Act  to ""maintenance,  computer  service and support services at  military installations"". (emphasis supplied).  With  this  legislative history,  I  am very  hopeful that we can move a  limited bill in  the House  in the remaining weeks of this  Congress. I do not think it would be possible  to move a bill with additional substance.  A number of worthwhile amendments were  proposed at our hearings this past week, and  I am hopeful that we will be 'able to turn to  them early in the next Congress.

295,,94,-0.331,1429,20,Mr. EVANS of Colorado.," Mr. Speak er, the National Association of Counties  has worked long and hard in support of  H.R. 9719, the payments in lieu of taxes  bill, which passed overwhelmingly today  by a vote of 269 to 125.  In view of this, I wish their letter to  me to be placed in the record:  NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES,  Washington, D.C., August 5, 1976.  Subj: Payments-in-lieu of taxes (H.R. 9719)  Hon. FRANKE. EVANS,  House of Representatives,  Rayburn House Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR CONGRESSMAN EVANS: The National  Association of Counties (NACo) actively sup ports the payments-in-lieu of taxes bill-(H.R.  9719) that you have sponsored. NACo believes  this legislation is long overdue to recognize  the inequities and burdens of large holdings  of federally-owned tax exempt lands.  More than a third of the U.S. land area is  federally  owned  and  escapes  local  taxes.  Counties are Jilt hard by this immunity, es pecially in the west where in many counties  80  to 90 per cent of the land  is federally  owned.  NACo has long advocated ""payments-in lieu""  legislation  recognizing  the  inequities  and burdens of these lands.  Despite a  limited tax base these counties  must provide law enforcement, road main :tenance, health  and other  local  govern ment services countywide.  This  legislation would  provide nowhere  near  the  revenue  that counties would re ceive if the lands were taxed as if privately  owned; but  the ""minimum payment"" ap proach has  the full backing of  the NACo  Public Lands Steering Committee, the NACo  Western Region District,  and  the  entire  NACo membership.  This legislation has the advantages of be ing easy to administer and a reasonable price  tag-only $115 million compared to the more  than $750 million  in receipts going to the  federal treasury from leases on these natu ral resource lands.  NACo  believes  payments-in-lieu's  time  has come. This is not just a western issue.  More than 1,000 counties are affected in 48  states. Payments would be limited by a per capita  limit so  that  no county would  re ceive a ""windfall"". Payments to counties un der H.R. 9719 would average only about 11  cents per acre overall. This is not asking too  much.  Study after study by federal committees  and  commissions have  demonstrated  the  need for this type of legislation. The Public  Land Law Review Commission recommended  that Congress enact payments-in-lieu legis lation.  The issue  is clear. Payments in lieu has  been studied enough. Now is the time for a.  vote!  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  August 5, 19'76  Your support is greatly appreciated.  Sincerely,  JIM EVANS,  Legislative Representative.  MATCHING FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR  STATE'S SOCIAL SERVICES PRO GRAM  HON. LARRY McDONALD  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, August 5, 1976  The effect of the law as it presently  stands is to add to the cost of social serv ice programs and thus reduce the serv ices available for a given amount of pub lic funding.  Rural  and non-urban  areas, where  public institutions often are not avail able, are particularly hard hit. The citi zens of these areas are taxed to pay for  social service programs, but are unable  to use the facilities of their private in stitutions to compete fairly for the estab lishment of social service programs in  their area. And to add insult to injury,  they also pay stat_e taxes to support state  institutions in urban areas, the facilities  of which are used as in kind services to  attract  social  service  programs  away  from the rural areas.  Mr. Speaker, whatever the reason for  including the prohibition of in kind serv ices from private institutions in title XX,  I am sure it was not intended to add to  the cost and discourage  the establish ment of social service programs. Remov ing this prohibition and allowing States  to use all  in kind services and goods  available  to  them will  require only a  minor change in title XX, but will allow  much more efficient and fair operation  of the social services programs.  I urge my colleagues to give their sup port to this legislation.  Thursday, August 5, 1976  HON. MARIO BIAGGI  PUERTO RICAN CONSTITUTION DAY  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Mr. McDONALD. Mr. Speaker, today  I am introducing legislation t.o allow the  States to use ""in kind"" goods and services  provided by private sources as part of a  State's share in matching Federal funds  for the State's social services program.  Presently, under title XX of the Social  Security Act,  the States are unable to  claim  in kind  services-the value  of  space, supplies, staff-provided by pri vate  institutions  to meet  the required  State share of the cost of its social serv ices programs. This prohibition does not  apply, however, to in kind contributions  of public  institutions, which may be  claimed as part of the State's share in  matching Federal funds.  Not only is this unwarranted discrimi nation against private institutions, but it  places an unnecessary burden on  the  St~tes and the taxpayers. The function  and value of an in kind service is the  same whether provided by a private or  public institution: it allows for more effi cient social service programs by making  use of existing facilities and personnel.  The only difference is that in kind serv",1976
296,,94,-0.469,1442,20,Mr. FRASER.," Mr. Speak~r. U.S.  in volvement in South Korea continues to  capture the attention of American jour nalists and commentators.  One of the most knowledgeable of the  commentators is Edwin 0. Reischauer,  University Professor at Harvard, a spe cialist in East Asian studies and former  U.S. Ambassador  to Japan. His essay,  ""Time for a New American Policy on  Korea,"" was published by the Christian  Science Monitor on July 26, 1976.  Ambassador Reischauer has  testified  before Congress on U.S. policy in South  Korea, and I  respect his opinions. He  advocates withdrawal of U.S. troops and  nuclear weapons from South Korea, but  in a manner that will not increase the  chances of war  iI1 Korea. ThiS with drawal, he believes, will:  Permit the United States to be more selec tive in its cooperation with, and aid to, South  Korea, so that American influence would be  more likely to favor the development of the  sort of free and democratic society that most  South Koreans hope for and that Americans  believe would best contribute to a healthy  and stable Korea.  Professor Reischauer's complete state ment fallows these remarks as does an  analysis ofthe United States and Korean  compliance with the 1953 Korean armis tice  agreement by another  academic,  Gregory Henderson, Adjunct Associate  Professor of Diplomacy at the Fletcher  School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts Uni versity. Henderson served as a State De partment expert on Korea for more than  16 yea.rs.  Finally I  include in the RECORD  two  editorials, one  from  the Los Angeles  Times,  the other  from  the Christian  Science Monitor, commnting on U.S. in volvement in the Korean peninsula 23  years after the armistice. Both note the  repressive nature of both Korean gov ernments  and  express  concern  about  U.S.  support for  the Park  regime  in  South Korea.  Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by the  continuing debate over U.S. policies  in  Korea. This is the sort of issue that ought  to be widely debated during the 1976  national elections.  [From the Christian Sclence Monitor,  July 26, 1976]  TIME FOR A NEW AMERICAN POLICY ON KOREA  (By Edwin' 0. Reisch-auer)  Today marks the 23rd anniversary of the  end of the Korean war, but the Korean pe ninsula is still one of the powder keg areas  of the world, with the United States sitting  on top of the keg.  North and South Korea, each big enough  to rank as a middle-sized country of  the  world, are squared off against each other in  bitter hostility. They a.re armed to the teeth,  with about a. mlllion men  together under  arms and another 2 mlllion as trained re serves. Shooting incidents occur from time  to time along the border and not far a.way  is stationed an American division, so placed  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  as inevitably to involve the United States,  should war break out. again.  Around Korea are grouped in close prox imity three other of the largest nations in  the world---China,  the Soviet Union, and  Japan-all of which have fought over Korea  in the past and distrust one another today.  The situation is not reassuring. It is high  time to take stock of what has happened in  Korea and what its future may hold in store  for the U.S. and for the world.  First, however, America should get rid of  some Inistaken notions. South Korea  is no  South Vietnam. Its people are solidly unified  against the Communist North, still remem bering its ruthlessness and cruelty when it  overran most of the South during the Korean  war. They have a  larger military establish ment than the North and are in the process  of gaining equality in the air, their one area  of relative weakness. They have  twice  the  population of the North and a more vigorous  economy. South Korea most certainly will  not crumple, no matter how hard the North  Korean dictator, Kim Il Sung, may huff and  pujf.  Also, neither of the two Koreas is much  like most other developing countries. They  share many of the characteristics that ac count  for  the extraordinary,  though con trasting, successes of Japan and China in re cent years. Their people are hard-working,  disciplined, and skilled organizers. They have  a passion  for education and have all but  wiped out illiteracy.  With  these  traits  the North has made  itself into the most tightly and repressively  organized of all the communist states. The  South has followed the trail blazed by Japan  as an industrial fast-grower, although, start ing later than Japan and from lower levels  of  technological modernization,  its success  is less assured, particularly in the face of the  recent vast rise in prices for the energy re sources and raw materials that both must  import.  '  The South's attempt to follow  the open  pattern of democratic politics and freedom  of expression  that has worked so well  in  Japan. has met with even less success. The  movement  in recent years has been away  from these freedoms toward growing repres sion and authoritarian controls.  South Korea nonetheless has sufficdently  high  educational and  economic  levels  to  make a free society and democratic~ political  institutions workable or, 1f  these are not  achieved,  to operate a  reasonably efficient  even if cruel dictatorship of the right.  The immediate problem in Korea is not its  backwardness or the danger that the South  might disintegrate. The problem  for  the  United States is the embarrassment of hav ing served as godfather to a rightist dicta torship and being committed to its defense,  even though the American people obviously  would  repudiate  this commitment  if war  actually broke out. This 1s a very danger ous situation to be in.  To South Koreans the past 31 years since  World War II have been their American pe riod, now comparable in length to the pre ceding Japanese period of 35 years of colonial  rule, when Japan blighted Korea national as pirations and bred a lasting hatred for Japan,  but at the same time did lay the founda tion and give  specific  shape  to much of  Korea's modern development. The Japanese  also molded Korea to the pattern they willed  for it.  In contra.st, the United States has advo cated one  thing  for Korea and produced  another. Much in modern Korean society has  been influenced by the U.S., and some of this  the American people can take pride in. It  was Christians, largely the converts of Amer ican missionaries, who once stood out as  champions of independence against the Jap anese, just as they are today the most fear less advocates of democracy and  freedom  of speech against native military rule.  26061  Ot;h.er borrowings from the United States,  however, have been less desirable. The arm  of government most repressive of the ,free doms of Koreans both at home and abroad is  the Korean Central  Intelligence Agency,  named for  its American counterpart. Gen erous American aid ha.s bred widespread cor ruption. And in any case the present dicta torial Korean Government is not at all what  any American would wish to see in Korea.  The spotty American record is the product  of both inattention and a desirable modesty  in American aims. The U.S. does not feel  that it should try to mastermind the future  for any other people. It is ready to a.id but  not to dictate. Unfortunately this half-way  position breeds  confusion. U.S.  aid often  seems to others like control. Korean liberals  are dispirited to see the United States in creasing its military support of a regime that  has destroyed their freedoms and the begin nings of Korean democracy.  What should the U.S. do now to correct  this situation and reduce the dangers to it self and the world? Clearly the first step is to  withdraw its troops and its nuclear weapons  from South Korea. If it does not do this it  will  be continuing  to  give unconditional  support to a regime that it does not believe in  and will remain in danger of becoming em broiled in a war there against the wishes 01'.  the American people and the best judgment  of their government.  The U.S. withdrawal, however, must be ac complished in such a. way as not to increase  the chances of war in Korea. It does not want  a repetition of 1950, when an American pull out helped  spark  the  invasion  from  the  North. The withdrawal should be gradual  and clearly announced  in advance, so no  shocks occur. The present commitment to  South Korea's defense should be  replaced  by a more general commitment to the peace  of the area.  The swme sort of commitment should apply  to Taiwan when the United States eventually  does recognize Peking and consequently must  give up its specific defense treaty with the  Nationalist regime. China. has clearly indi cated  that  it  is not considering military  action to regain Taiwan at this  time, and  neither it nor the Soviet Union has the least  desire to go to war over Korea.  The possibility, however vague, of Ameri can m111tary reprisal would be a further de terrent to Chinese or Soviet military action,  and North Korea. would not on its own em bark on a. military adventure against a larger  and probably stronger South, especially 1f  there is even a, small possibility of an Ameri can military response.  The U.S. withdrawal  from Korea  also  sllould be accompanied by other more posi tive moves. It is  the close  involvement of  China,  the Soviet Union,  Japan, and  the  United States in Korea that makes it a much  greater danger to world peace than are even  less stable areas  in Southeast Asia or the  other developing regions of the world. The  U.S. should take advantage of its withdrawal  to work for a four-power agreement on the  neutralization of Korea  from other world  tensions,  leaving  the  two Korean  regimes  to work on their problem of unification with out fear of external pressures.  Since  the American defense position  in  Korea often has been described as being basi cally  in behalf of its Japanese ally, with drawal  from Korea also should be accom panied by clear reaffirmations of its commit ment  to Japan's defense and cooperation  with  Japan  in all  fields-a position  that  spokesmen of both the political parties in  the U.S. have 'recently made clear is an ac cepted, supra-partisan American stand.  Fina.Uy, the withdrawal would permit the  U.S. to be more selective in its cooperation  with, and aid to, South Korea, so that Amer ican influence would be more likely to favor  the development of  the sort of  free and  democratic society that most South Koreans  ",1976
297,,94,-0.504,1455,20,Mr. BOLLING.," Mr. Speaker, I would  call to the attention of our colleagues the  exceptionally appropriate  tribute paid  the Vietnam veteran by James H. Webb.  Excerpts from Mr. Webb's recent address  were published in the Washington Post  on Wednesday, August 4, 1976.  The article follows:  THE INVISmLE VIETNAM VETERAN  (By James H. Webb)  The most important part of an award such  as this ls its symbolic value as notice to the  community.  I  don't need  to elaborate  in  front of this assemblage about how incredi bly difficult it has been for the Vietnam vet eran. His anonymity and  lack of positive  feedback about himself and his fellow vet erans have intensified all the other difficul ties he has faced, including those shared by  non-veterans. With the exception of a  few  well-publicized disaster  stories, he  is  in visible.  To my mind, the roots of this problem go  back 10 or 11 years, when the veteran suffered  the irony of having people, who directly op posed both his views and his acts, become  accepted as his spokesmen, in the name of  the ""generation gap,'' since he and they were  from  the same age group. But it's obvious  that it wasn't age that separated views on  Vietnam, and especially on what to do about  it:  It was culture. And  the cultures  that  fought Vietnam have traditionally lacked ac cess to the media and power centers of this  country. As a result, their views have gone  unheard and it has been presumed that, on  the whole, ""youth"" embraced the views of  the anti-war faction.  The lack of positive feedback persists. A  Vietnam veteran  looks  for  success stories  within his own age group and finds  that,  by and large, they belong to people from one  or two sub groups. Either the person man aged to avoid the war altogether, with no  stigma for doing so, and was able to devote  full time to his field without the interrup tion of being in the service, or he actively  opposed the war and has now converted his  anti-war activities into credentials-much as  the veteran of World War n did with his  campaign ribbons.  August 5, 19'76  The anonymity persists. I recall my most  frustrating moment as a Vietnam veteran.  The day after Saigon fell and it was finally  over, a local newspaper ran what was tanta mount to a special edition on ""What Vietnam  Did To America."" On the front pag.e were two  human-interest  stories. One  detailed  the  frustrations of a draft resistor. The other  was about a person who had quit his civil  service  job because he had ""lost faith""  in  the American system of government, and  then, sadly, had to become a iawyer. The cen ter of the front section had two full pages  of interviews-at least 50 of them-with peo ple from across the entire spectrum of Amer ican cultures.  With one exception. There was not one  interview with a Vietnam veteran. It was as  if he had ceased to exist along with the gov ernment of South Vietnam-or perhaps was  merely considered irrelevant in determining  the effect on the rest of society of the very  issue that had touched him the most directly  and intensely.  And the whole notion of invisibility per sists in other forms as well. We read repeated  editorials and articles urging amnesty for the  ones who fled. I  realize that there is mucl:l  room for differences of opinion on this issue,  even among veterans. But no matter what a  Vietnam veteran's position on the amnesty  issue, he cannot help but feel the knife twist  every time he reads articles that elevate the  ones who  fled,  collectively,  to  the  level of  prophets and moral purists. The phrase that  sticks in my mind, used quite often, is that  they ""obeyed a higher law, that of their own  consciences, and fied.""  The  unwritten  implication,  again  and  again,  is  that  the Vietnam veteran, who  merely obeyed the ""lower law,"" that of his  country, did so out of immorality or lack of  conscience. Or, to be blunt: We seem to have  reached the anomaly where the very institu tion, and the same newspapers, who only a  few years ago called for us to bleed, have now  decided that we should be ashamed of our  scars.  Well, I'm not ashamed of mine. And I will  always believe that the individual who ago nized over the incredibly complex moral and  political  issues of Vietnam, and then went  there, displayed an equal level of conscience,  and a hell of a lot more maturity, than his  counterpart who fled. To go required an ac ceptance,  sometimes  conscious  and  some times visceral, of  the premise that he was  living in a nation of laws and not specially  privileged people. It also required a sublima tion of self to what, at least then, was per ceived to be in the public good. The person  who fled, no matter how great his agonizings,  finally decided  the  issue  in his own self interest. If he had been a true ""moral purist,""  he would have gone to jail for his beliefs .  The Vietnam veteran has a lot to be proud  of. If the anti-war elements in this country  had opposed the war with the same maturity  and patience that he displayed in fighting it,  perhaps 10,000 more of his contemporaries  might be alive today. People being what they  are, and emotions what  they are, Vietnam  would have been a less volatile issue, and the  war would have ended sooner.  I earnestly hope that awards such as this  will encourage the community to accord the  Vietnam veteran with dignity and respect.  He has always deserved it.

I  feel that the conferees have given in to  a Senate amendment which is going to  prove  to be an embarrassment and a  mistake. An amendment was added by  the other body which would delete the  Treasury and Department of Transpor tation representatives from  this Board.  According  to articles  that  I have read  in the press recently, this is directed at  individuals who have had the courage to  stand up and to show some of the ex cesses that have been committed by the  USRA Board  adoption of  conference  this  For example, an audit by Treasury  auditing  teams have exposed  the fact  that $5,000 initiation fees have been paid  to country clubs,  that fat expense ac counts for entertainment expenses have  been  expended  for  the  last  several  months.  Mr. Speaker, it seems to me we should  be supporting Government officials who  will be looking for excesses like these and  not adopting amendments which will in  effect delete certain individuals from the  Board so that they will not be able in  the future to review the actions of this  agency, and to insure that the moneys  of the taxpayers are being spent wisely.  However, Mr. Speaker,  the conferees  have adopted an amendment which will,  in effect, delete the Under Secretary of  the Treasury and the representative of  the Department of Transportation, the  Under Secretary,  from  the Board,  so  that they will no longer be able to have  this oversight responsibility or ability to  review what this Agency is doing.  For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I would  urge that the Members vote no on this  conference report so that the present law  would continue to be in effect, that these  administrative officials would continue  to serve on the Board to assure that the  taxpayers' moneys are spent wisely. I in clude an article from yesterday's Wash ington Star that describes these events  in greater detail.

ToM DowNING  has played an important role in Congress  since  the beginning of  the 86th Con gress in 1959, his freshman year in this  body, We will miss him.  As a fellow member of the Merchant  Marine and Fisheries Committee and as  chairman of the Merchant Marine Sub committee, I have always found ToM to  be courteous, helpful, and willing to lis ten, regardless of the problem or request.  During his  tenure as chairman of  the  subcommittee, he has taken an active role  in shaping the country's maritime policy  and has  tried  to be responsive  the  needs of all elements of the maritime  community. As a  representative of an  area with a  long and continuing mari time  tradition, he has been peculiarly  fitted for that role.  ToM DoWNING is a gentleman and that  quality has been evident in his conduct  here in the House. At a  time when it  seems increasingly difficult to get a con sensus on any major issue, when indi viduals often seem  intent on pushing  their own position at the expense of any  position, the House wm miss ToM DoWN ING. His ability  to work constructively  with a wide range of people and yet be  fair to all, his ability to accommodate  yet provide strong, leadership, above all,  his ability to totally dedicate himself to  furthering maritime  interests  of  the  United States,  these are qualities  that  will be missed.  Mr. Speaker, ToM DOWNING has served  for many years  the people of his con gressional district, and of his State, of  the Nation. It is with deep sadness and  appreciation that I join my colleagues in  bidding him farewell.  ",1976

Throughout his 16 years in the House,  ToM has distinguished himself on both  the Science and Technology and Mer chant Marine Committees, particularly in  the development of our last great fron tiers, outer space and the oceans. Yet he  is a man whose interests range beyond  these challenges.  He has felt so strongly the need  serve the ends of justice that, as chair man of  the Select Committee, he will  spend the remaining months of this year  overseeing its work. ToM  is to be com mended for his willingness to take on  such a difiicult job at this time. He has  already earned his impending retirement  through his many legislative contribu tions over the years. The House will in deed be indebted to TOM DOWNING  for  this last vital contribution to its work.  ",1976

It is anticipated that some 1 million per sons will line State Street to help cele brate this national holiday, and as many  as 3 million are expected to watch this  grand event on television, which will be  televised by WGN-TV.  The voyage of Christopher Columbus  marked one of history's most challenging  and  rewarding  explorations,  and  the  theme  for  this year's parade,  ""From  Columbus to the Moon,"" is a  tribute to  the courageous settlers who came after  him and honors the Nation, as well as  the Italian contribution to  the Nation.  which carries forth Columbus' spirit of  exploration as part of its national heri tage.  Mr. Speaker,  the mayor of Chicago,  Honorable Richard J. Daley, and  the  Governor  of  Illinois, Honorable Dan  Walker, have  issued proclamations  in  celebration of Columbus Day 1976, and  those proclamations follow:  PROCLAMATION  WHEREAS,  the Joint Civic Committee of  Italian Americans will a~ain this year spon :-;or our city's Columbus Day celebration and  parade; and  WHEREAS. Columbus Day  is observed by  resolution of  the Congress of  the United  States in tribute to Christopher Columbus.  Genoa-born navigator and explorer. who in  the year 14!)2  forever broadened mankind's  hopes and hori?.ons; and  WHEREAS.  in  the current time of space  exploration,  the exploits and intrepidity of  Christopher Columbus can be even ~nore ap preciated in view of his primitive sailing vessels and the limited knowledge of navigators;  and  WHEREAS,  the courage and humanity of  Christopher Columbus exemplified the great  spirit of the Italian people--the same spirit  which permeates  the Italian Americans of  Chicago who  contribute  so much  to  the  vitality, culture and betterq1ent of our city:  NOW, THEREFORE,  I, Richard J. Daley,  Mayor of the City of Chicago, do hereby pro claim Monday, October 11, 1976  to be CO LUMBUS DAY  IN OHICAGO and urge all  citizens, organizations, churches and schools  to participate in celebration, and by proper  display of the flag of the United States, in  fitting tribute and appreciation to the place  held in our history by Christopher Columbus.  Dated this 8th day of September, 1976.  RICHARD J. DALEY,  Mayor.  PROCLAMATION  Our nation and our state are great because  of the men and women who build and main tain our communities, who daily strive to be  good citizens and help their fellowmen.  We honor great men and women not only  for  their individual achievements but also  because  they personify the people of  their  race or time or creed and because a study  of their lives may be an inspiration to those  who come after them.  We in Illinois have long observed Colum bus Day in memory of Christopher Columbus  and those who followed him to our unknown  shores. In the intervening years Italians have  contributed much to the development of our  nation, founding families and industries and  business enterprises.  They have distinguished themselves in the  arts and sciences, in philosophy and religion,  in government and education, and are widely  recognized  for  their understanding hearts  and generosity.  There will be many celebrations of this day  throughout the state.  Therefore I, Dan Walker, Governor of the  State of Illinois, proclaim October 11, 1976,  Columbus Day throughout Illinois and hope  that every community will have  a  joyous  celebration.  DAN WALKER,  Governor.

Dr. Mary  Ellen Batinich and Mrs. Theresa Petrone  are  the  chairmen of  the  committees  which are contributing to the success of  the parade by preparing authentic Ital ian folk costumes and American Bicen tennial-era costumes. Christopher Co lumbus,  the father of all  immigrants,  will be portrayed this year by Joe Rio,  1301 South Cuyler Street, Berwyn, Ill.  Gov.

Even  though  the Senate has blocked  further consideration of the bill referred  to in this telegram, Reynolds Industries  wanted the message that follows to be a  part of  the RECORD  for  the benefit of  those who will be considering similar leg islation  in  the  future. The  telegram  follows:  ",1976
321,House,94,-0.102,903,27,Mr. TEAGUE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise now  in support of  the gentleman's unani mous-consent request, but first I want  to express my sincere appreciation  our distinguished chairman for his yield ing to me and for having provided for  us during this session of the Congress  the leadership and the complete coopera tion which has permitted us to arrive at  this point. During  this session of  the  Congress comprehensive hearings were  conducted in special investigative hear ings of the Subcommittee on Education  and Training chaired by our able col league, Mr. MoTTL  of Ohio.  In  these  hearings we looked into the serious prob lem of overpayments and of laxities in  enforcement of standards of progress in  the veterans' education programs. As  amended, this bill would go further than  the version that was originally passed  by the House October 6, 1975. The bill  now incorporates not only a needed cost of-living rate increase in the area of 8  percent but it provides for substantive  program changes which are dictated by  the fact that the Vietnam era conflict  has ended, that we are now dealing with  an all-volunteer Army,  and  that  the  needs of the individuals currently enter ing active duty are far different from  those for whom the post-Korean educa tional assistance program was designed.  The bill as amended continue.s the pro vision terminating the accrual of entitle ment under the post-Korean educational  assistance program and it provides for a  new program with participation of the  individual. While  the bill now discon tinues accumulation of eligibility for GI  bill benefits after December 31, 1976, and  sets up as a  test a new program under  which the veteran would contribute $1  and the Federal Government would con tribute $2  to create an educational as sistance fund available to the veteran for  education and training purposes on his  discharge. ShoUld this test warrant con tinuation by the Congress and the Presi dent at the end of 5 years,  then it is  contemplated that the program would be  continued and the expense of the pro gram would then be assumed by the De fense Department. We have concurred in  these Senate amendments. We have not  concurred in a Senate provision which  would have automatically triggered re sumption of  the GI bill  in event of a  resumption of the draft. This should not  be  interpreted as any departure from  previously well established policy. The  principle of education and readjustment  assistance for individuals who enter the  Armed Forces on an involuntary basis  during a  time of emergency has been  well established by the actions of  the  Congress in the past. We would contem plate that should it again become neces sary to reinstitute a draft that the Con gress would respond immediately to ex tend education and readjustment bene fits  to such drafted individuals and to  design the program in the light of the  needs then apparent.  I believe you should understand that  our attempts to address ourselves to the  problems which we found during the spe cial hearings into educational abuses and  about which you cannot but be aware be cause of a continuing publicity accorded  these matters represent a melding of sug gestions we have received from the ad ministration, attempts at correction in corporated in the Senate version of the  bill and our efforts. I can only hope that  with  these amendments and  the steps  already taken by the Veterans' Admin istration those who are enrolling in edu cational programs supported with your  tax-provided dollars will be exposed to  some educational experience rather than  as so often today is the case permitted  to enroll, draw their benefits and never go  close to a classroom. The amendments  added by the Senate are consistent with  our objective to minimize abuses in ad ministration  of  the program  and  to  strengthen the hand of the administrator  to the extent possible in order that he can  assure that individuals participating in  the program will acquire the added edu cation and training needed to take their  rightful place in our economy.  Provisions  of  the bill  as  originally  passed by  the House and as still con tained would extend the maximum edu cational benefits to 45 months for all eli gible veterans and would provide as well  for the same number of months of en titlement for those survivors and depend ents of veterans who are permanently  and totally disabled or who died of serv ice-connected disabilities.  The predischarge education program  which was established by Public Law 91219 back in 1970 was originally designed  to provide assistance to servicemen and  women which would permit them on dis charge to pursue education and training  or some vocation. The assistance intended  by that provision was to make available  a limited program of education or train ing prior to discharge from active duty  which would provide an entry level of  competency for the intended additional  education or vocational pursuit. We were  at that time engaged in hostilities. Indi viduals were being drafted. There were  those going into service who needed high  school completion work or a course or two  to make it possible for them to immedi ately and adequately utilize the educa tional assistance provided by the Veter ans' Administration programs upon their  release. It just now appears that there  is no continued need for the prep pro gram as it is now being presently utilized,  which is at the beginning of an individ ual's enlistment rather than just imme diately before his separation. We have  terminated  the prep program for new  enrollments for all those whose entitle ment exists under current programs but  have made available during the last 6  months of an enlistment the same type  of entry level training for those service men and women who participate in the  new cooperative program.

I had the distinct pleasure and honor  to serve on the Interior Committee when  RoY was elected  to Congress some 16  years ago. Since that time, I have worked  with RoY on numerous legislative pro posals, always enjoying the benefit of his  wisdom and skill.  Few men have made such lasting con RoY. He has fought to add over 1.5 mil tributions to posterity in recent times as  lion acres  to our Nation's parks-long  before it became politically popular to do  so. Conservation has once again come  under  attack  in  these  economically  troubled  times, but this has only stif fened RoY's resolve to insure the wise use  of our natural resources. We will miss  his dedicated efforts on behalf of  the  preservation of our natural heritage, but  posterity will be the beneficiary of his  tireless efforts.  I will always be indebted to RoY for his  untiring assistance  in  the struggle  to  preserve the middle Snake River in its  wild, free-flowing state and create the  Hells Canyon National Recreation Area.  But there would be no finer tribute to his  long, distinguished career than the suc cessful conclusion of another long battle.  This, of course, is the addition of another  beautiful river to the Wild and Scenic  Rivers System-the New River.  It is very difficult  to bid farewell  to  such a good friend and able legislator as  ROY TAYLOR, but I otTer my very best  wishes  for  the future. After all, RoY,  there is a  lot of good fishing in those  streams you have been protecting.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  NOVEMBER ELECTION  HON. THOMAS N. DOWNING  OF VIRGINIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 29, 1976  ",1976
326,,94,-0.065,1059,27,Mr. DOWNING of Virginia.," Mr.  Speaker, as the November elections ap proach, each of us must take time to re flect upon what  it means  to have  the  freedom to make monumental decisions  affecting the course of our Nation. Every one who has the right to vote has a voice  and a stake in this country's future.  Hopefully, each voting citizen will use  his or her best judgment and conscience  at the polling place in selecting the best  men and women to lead the Nation. In  some instances, a small prayer for guid ance might be in order.  In that regard, Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to  take  this opportunity  to share  with my colleagues the thoughts of my  friend, Mrs. Preston T. Hayes of Hamp ton, Va., who believes that prayer may  help enlighten us as we prepare to exer cise our franchise.  I  feel certain my colleagues will find  Mrs. Hayes' thoughts as inspiring as I  have:  A PLEA FOR CONCERTED PRAYER FOR A SUCCESS   FUL ELECTION  IN NOVEMBER  (By Mrs. Preston T. Hayes)  The approaching election of leaders for the  top offices  in this great nation  (November  1976), this year in which we so proudly cele brate our 200th birthday, may very well be  the most critical one in the history of this  modern world.  The signing of that great historical docu ment,  the Declaration of Independence, on  July 4,  1776, became  the very  foundation  upon whi-ch this nation has grown, prospered,  and extended its infiuence to all the nations  of the world. Today, when this and all other  world powers are being torn apart by reli gious strife; political unrest and upheaval;  many  scientific  theories;  theological  ap proaches; and general world dilemma, stress  and frustration; we must seek answers and  divine guidance as we strive to become ef fective instruments in restoring some order  to the growing problems of the world.  The Declaration of Independence not only  made us a free and independent nation, but  it placed a great emphasis upon the worth  and dignity of all men. It has become the  foundation upon which this nation has built  and extended its influence to all the corners  of the world. According to the terms of that  great declaration, ""All men are created equal  and endowed by their Creator with certain  inalienable rights, among these, life, liberty  and the pursuit of happiness.""  This nation has become the ""land of op portunity""  for men of every nation,  race,  creed and religion. It has become  this be cause we dared to believe and pursue those  dreams which we had. Many have found the  end of the rainbow and that elusive ""pot of  gold.""  Today, we must again become dreamers.  We must dream of a  free, democratic, con cerned government that believes in the worth  of all men and one that has its feet planted  firmly on a solid foundation of ethics, obedi ence to the will of God, and an overwhelm ing desire to see peace, decency, justice and  honesty in government;  thereby, extending  the same influence into every phase of gov ernment. Only we, the people of these United  States, can put ideal leaders into positions of  trust. It has been our failure or victory when  35429  we have become blind and dazzled by glib  and smooth politicians who know all of the  techniques of winning a victory which  is  based upon only promises and words. We are  only weak and frail human beings who are  searching  for  that  ""eternal  fountain  of  youth."" How easily we can be deceived. The  times are the same today as they have al ways been, therefore, we must utilize every  God-given ability to help us meet the chal lenge of a world which is filled with tempta tions, which are deliberately dangled before  our eyes. Our only hope is to think prayer fully about everything we hear and see.  If we are going to become victorious in this  election and in our personal  lives, we are  goiing to have to reflect back to the life of  that lowly Galilean who walked this earth  as God's only Son, humbly  teaching men  how to live with one another in peace and  harmony, a young man who had riches un told but chose nothing more  for Himself  than  the opportunity  to bring hope and  eternal life to mankind. His final victory was  a cruel death on the cross, but by giving His  life He gave all of us redemption from our  sins. What greater gift could any man give  for others. Because of His death and resur rection, we realize that we must turn to Him  for this and all other critical decisions in our  lives. We must  look  to our Savior  Jesus  Christ  for help  in  these situations which  we are simply not wise enough to under stand.  My husband, Dr. Preston T. Hayes, Pastor  of the Second Baptist Church, E. E. Newport  News,  joins me  in making this request for  concerted prayer for divine help in electing  leaders who are capable of leading us vic  toriously these next four years.  We sincerely believe that if we establish a  special period of time when most of us can  pause and bow our heads in concerted pray ers faithfully until election time, God wlll  surely direct us in the election of the ma:a  who  is capable of  leading  this  influential  nation.  We have considered several day and night  hours and most of them have held some rea son why another  time might be more ac ceptable to the majority of people. Therefore,  we believe that ten o'clock each night to be a  wonderful  time  for many of us  to  stop  whatever we are doing, wherever we are, and  pray sincerely and faithfully for God's guid ance  and wisdom  in helping  to elect  the man to lead our country. We must also  pray for our country and each candidate, as  well as for deliverance from the many seen  and unseen dangers which are ever present.  Somehow, I  feel confident that with this  kind  of  dedication  and  prayer  reaching  heaven at the same time by many, many con cerned believers, God will grant us another  opportunity to return to the democratic so ciety which has been the hope and inspira tion of nations and peoples all over  the  world. I also believe that if there is a threat  from other sources  these  too may be dis solved.  Please join us at ten o'clock eaching even ing  for a  few moments of prayer for our  country and its future, and for wisdom in  our selection of the officers of the highest  position in our nation.  \lSI  CONGRESSIONAL CEMETERY  HON. LINDY BOGGS  OF LOUIS IAN A  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 29, 1976  ",1976
327,,94,-0.359,1059,27,Mrs. BOGGS.," Mr. Speaker, I submit for  the RECORD a tribute to this 94th and Bi centennial Congress. As a  sensitive and responsible  result of the  leadership of  ",1976
328,,94,-0.599,1098,27,Mr. BADILLO.," Mr. Speaker, there are  435 Members of Congress from all over  the country working here in Washing ton, and I feel it is most exceptional and  especially noteworthy when a local paper  singles out one of us  to applaud and  commend. The Washington Star  re cently saluted my colleague from New  York,  Congressman  FRED  RICHMOND,  whose outstanding work, leadership, and  tenacity have resulted in his selection  to chair the Forests Subcommittee as a  freshman Member of Congress. From my  own personal experience in working with  Mr. RICHMOND, I know that every word  of this article is true. Indeed, he has sur passed  the normal expectations of a  freshman Congressperson, and his com mitment, interest and active role in the  House Agriculture Committee have made  this a wise and welcome decision by  members of that Committee. I know you  will join me in congratulating Mr. RicH MOND in this great honor, and hope that  you will enjoy reading the following arti cle as much as I did.  I am inserting, for my colleagues, this  article in its entirety, as it appeared in  the Washington Star on September 28,  1976:  TREES GROW IN BROOKLYN, Too  It's unusual for a  freshman congressman  to head a  subcommltttee but what's even  more unusual in the case of Rep. Fred Rich mond  is that a  city boy has been put in  charge of U.S. forest oversight.  Mr. Richmond, who halls from Brooklyn,  is from all accounts one of tl::.e hardest work ing members of the House Agriculture Com mittee, of which the Forests Subcommittee  is a. part. In looking  through our files we  came upon an editorial written last year in  which we gave Mr. Richmond high marks  for beefing about a  proposal  to create a  beef research and marketing board. We and  Representative Richmond didn't think  it  necessary for the federal government to get  into the business of promoting beef eating,  considering how much cholesterol most over fed and overweight Americans already are  packing around; but Congress went ahead  and passed the le{Zislation anyway.  At any rate, Mr. Richmond's colleagues on  the  Agriculture  Committee must  have  thought he was doing something right. They  selected him  the other day  to chair  the  Forests Subcommittee which has  jurisdic tion over legislation affecting 155 national  forests encompassing 187 mllllon acres, and  the Forest Service which has 20,000 em ployees and an annual budget of $1.2 b11lion.  He takes over the post made vacant by the  death of Rep. Jerry Litton of Missouri. who  had an impressive background in agriculture  Mr. Richmond is going to have his hands  full. Preservation of national forests has be come an emotional issue at a time when high  demand for  lumber is depleting privately owned stands of timber. Industry and ecolo gists are locked in a. raging battle over when  and how timber should be cut from the na tional forests.  Mr. Richmond said he hopes ""to bring a  fresh, unbiased outlook to the complex issues  of balancing supply and demand  for our  nation's timber with ecological concerns.""  While he's providing congressional over sight of the vast hinter1a.nd forests Mr. Richmond apparently isn't going to forget where  he comes from. He said a priority item wlll  be  the Urban Forestry Act, which he has  sponsored along with two New York Republi cans, Sen. Jacob Javits and Rep. Ha.mllton  Fish Jr., to provide greenery and some shady  spots for the city folks.  The Urban Forest Act would authorize  federal dollar-for-dollar matching funds for  private contributions for tree planting and  maintenance in urban areas and 50 cents on  the dollar for contributions  from munici palities. That's no  small  thing;  the city  fathers of Dayton, Ohio found, for example,  that it cost $33,600 to plant 47 medium-sized  trees  around  the  city's new Courthouse  Square--more than $700 a  tree.  We  see no  reason why Mr. Richmond  shouldn't do well  in his new assignment.  After all, farm and forest legislation affects  consumers as much as it does farmers and  foresters.  Besides,  they?  in Brooklyn, don't  trees grow  FEDERAL AGENCY  INTERFERENCE  IN STATE ELECTIONS  HON. MARK W.HANNAFORD  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 30, 1976  ",1976
329,,94,-0.295,1098,27,Mr. HANNAFORD.," Mr. Speaker, the  General Accounting omce has substan tiated reports that the Energy Research  and Development Administration dis tributed certain documents immediately  before the June California referendum  in order to defeat a proposition limiting  the expansion of nuclear powerplants in  the State. Even though the GAO report  concludes  that  these documents were  propaganda and indicates that their dis tribution was far wider than could rea sonably have been proper, no law was  broken.  This reprehensible intervention by a  Federal agency in a State election is an  obvious misappropriation of public funds.  Even though Federal agencies have been  prohibited from  lobbying Congress, no  similar prohibition exists on their lobby ing State legislatu::.-es or State voters con sidering State referendums. Thus there  is no guarantee that such activities will  not continue, or that Federal agencies  will not become more blantant and ag gressive in their intrusion into local elec tion processes.  Mr. WIRTH of Colorado, Mr. UDALL of  Arizona, and I will push during the next  Congress for legislation to close this loop hole. However, among the legislative is sues on State ballots this fall are nuclear  initiatives, similar to the California prop osition, in seven States-Arizona, Colo rado, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon,  and Washington. While we do not neces sarily support  these  initiatives, we be lieve that the voters should be able to  make their decisions free f:::om unwar ranted interference by ERDA or other  agencies. Consequently, we  introduced  H.R. 15738 on Tuesday to expand the ex isting lobbying law so as to prohibit Fed eral agency intervention in State law making processes and to demonstrate to  Federal agencies the strong congressional  antipathy to such behavior.  We will reintroduce our bill with addi tional cosponsors on Friday and hope  that you will join us. Members who wish  to cosponsor. this bill, or who have any  questions, should call Stephen Saunders  at X52161.  MEDICAL CARE-DOUBLE DIGIT IN FLATION STILL EXISTS  HON. ROBERT L. LEGGETT  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 30, 1976  ",1976
330,,94,-0.468,1098,27,Mr. LEGGETT.," Mr. Speaker, much of  our discussion of economic  issues con tinues to center on the perils of inflation.  What are the prospects for another in flationary upsurge as the recovery pro gresses? What are the steps we should  be taking now  to prepare for such an  eventuality? Can we safely pursue the  kind of stimulative, jobs oriented policy  that I and many of my colleagues feel  is essential without some form of effec tive wage-price restraint?  The  current  administration  clearly  looks on high employment as an accept able price to pay for cutting the infla tion rate. They regarded the drop from  1974's double digit rate of inflation as  one of the major accomplishments of the  Ford administration. And  if you  look  just at  the overall price  level, which  shows the annual rate of increase in the  consumer price index falling from over  12 percent in 1974 to 7 percent in 1975  and less than 5 percent in the first 7  months of 1976, it is clear that the in flation rate has abated considerably at  least so far.  All of the laudatory talk should not,  however, lull us into believing that dou ble digit inflation is entirely a  thing of  the past. If we look at medical care, we  see  that in  this key area prices have  failed for the most part to follow  the  moderating trend that is evident for the  economy as a whole. In the 11 months  ending in March 1976, the most recent  period for which data is available, medi cal care prices as a whole rose at an  annualized rate of Just less than 10 per cent, 70 percent faster than the economy  as a whole, and more than double the  inflation rate for medical care during the  economic stabilization program.  Indeed, as we examine  the medical  care industry, it is hard to see any con firmation of the dire prophecies of those  such as George Schultze, who were warn ing of the terrible effects which the price  control program would have on our econ omy. It was Mr. Schultze, you will recall,  who was the leading light in the deci sion of the Nixon fldministration to move  from  the reasonably effective phase II  of ESP to the ill-fated phase III.  It is interesting to note that medical  care is on~ of the few sectors which fared  quite well price-wise during phase III,  with the inflation rate going up only to  an annualized  rate of 3.8 percent, as  compared with phase  II's 3.4 percent  rate. The reason for this notable depar ture from overall form-the CPI  less  medical care went from 3.6 percent in  phase II to 9.5 percent in phase III of course, is that the mandatory phase I  rules promulgated for  the health care  industry were continued when phase II,  ",1976

His opening statement, which was de livered spontaneously, evoked many of  the frustrations the Hollywood produc tion community has confronted regard ing televised violence. He spoke not only  about how the family viewing policy is  implemented, but to the deeper questions  of: What is violence? What is the rela tionship between violence on television  and violence in society? Who should ex ercise ultimate responsibility over these  things?  His is a moving and forceful statement  which I trust will receive the careful con sideration of my colleagues:  PRESENTATION BY MR. DAVID GERBER  ",1976
332,,94,-0.576,1124,27,Ms. BURKE of California.," Mr. Speak er, I would like to take this opportunity  to commend Cue 0. White, of Los An geles, for his imaginative solution to a  problem which has plagued cities  for  years. I am referring to the robberies and  physical attacks which this Nation's bus  drivers endured  for years before Cue  White, the first black man ever elected  to a. United Transportation Union post  in Los Angeles, offered his exact-fare  plan in 1967.  As chairman of a United Transporta tion Union local, Cue was in a perfect  position to understand the dimensions of  the problem. Prior to the 1969  imple mentation of his plan in Los Angeles,  uncertainties about fares created ten sions and fears on the part of employees  and passengers. Drivers wasted valuable  time making  change,  and  confusion  reigned over the complicated fare system.  Then, in December 1967, Cue White  wrote a colwnn outlining the ""Cue Plan,""  in which he called for an exact-fare plan  for the transit system. At first,  it was  opposed by other union officials. But Cue  persisted and succeeded in drawing the  interest of the Federal Government and  a.  number of  eastern cities.  In 1968,  Washington, D.C.,  adopted  his  plan,  closely followed by Baltimore, Philadel phia, Pittsburgh, Oakland,  and other  cities. Crime decreased astronomically.  October 1, 1976  Finally, Los Angeles adopted  the plan  and robbery attempts declined from one  per day in 1969 to two in all of 1970.  Cue White is a dedicated man whose  imagination and persistence have  re duced  crimes  committed  against  bus  drivers,  thus saving  taxpayers' money  and  reducing  tensions  in  the  transit  system, as well as improving the efficien cy of public transportation. His humani tarian spirit stands as an inspiration to  us all.  NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION  POLICY  HON. ELLIOTT H.

I wish to commend Mr. Welch on his  comprehensive statement dealing with  the transportation industry and its serv ice  to  the American people. There  is  much in the statement with which I am  in  agreement, most  particularly Mr.  Welch's advocacy of the direct AtlantA to London and Paris air fiigh ts, consider ing  that Atlanta now has  the second  busiest airport in the world and shoulfl  be able to offer international service, an('  his suggestion that the Atlanta commer  cial zone be expanded.

PASSMAN, Member of  Congress from Louisiana on his retire ment from the U.S. House of Represen tatives.  During the period of the great increase  in our responsibilities as a nation for the  leadership of the free world, the gentle man from Louisiana protected the pub lic purse as if every dollar spent was one  of his own. It was and is his deep con viction  that  the American people ex pected total vigilance in the spending of  tax dollars.  Congressman PASSMAN  fulfilled  that  trust whether or not he was in the ma jority or alone in his conviction. He was  a man who deserved respect. He received  respect because of his diligence, his ca pacity to build a case on facts, and his  sincerity.  Because the American people have had  to bear great burdens because of our  international responsibilities,  they had  every right to expect a maximum amount  of scrutiny of spending to support the  international  position  of  the United  States.  Congress PASSMAN's career from 1955  until now gave the American people the  assurance they needed that the Congress  was as concerned as thev in restricting  the vast expenditures called for, to that  which was necessary. As a member of the  International Relations Committee of  the House for most of this period, I sup port the view that the activities of Con gressman PASSMAN were a necessary and  vital part of carrying to the American  people the message of great international  responsibilities, balanced by a concern  for the need for restraint in carrying out  that role.  I wish our friend well. He has earned  a retirement based on the serenity that  comes from a job well done. I know that  he will keep us informed of his concerns  during his retirement.  W. S.

As a member of the  powerful Ways and Means Committee,  Mr. MILLS  represented the area which  includes Oklahoma on the committee on  committees. Thus, he was one of the first  Members with whom I became acquaint ed since all my committee assignments  were managed by him.  This  relationship  developed  into  a  warm and close friendship, one which  our wives and families came to have and  enjoy. A great deal of the life I have had  as a Member was involved in those mat ters in which our families participated  with us.  More than all this, I became impressed  early in the game with the many talents  Mr. MILLS brought to his office. He al ways has been one of the ablest and most  effective  presiding  officers when  the  House has been chaired by him. He is one  October 1, 1976  of the most articulate Members and was  gifted with a delivery that made him as  effective  in his  presentations  as  his  thoughts and ideas were important.  As time went by, he became more and  more recognized as the most authorita tive Member on all tax legislation. He  also pioneered the health insurance laws  and probably has written more social se curity acts than all the other Members  combined.  He is now retiring from his labors here  after an unusuaHy long tenure. He has  well earned retirement. He has left his  good mark on the laws of America and  his accomplishments have been of such  high quality  that it will not soon be  possible for his expertise to be replaced.  My wife  joins me  in extending  to  WILBUR and his lovely wife our very best  wishes for a happy and fruitful life as  they leave here.  CONGRESSMAN F. EDWARD HEBERT  HON. WILBUR D. MILLS  OF ARKANSAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 27, 1976  Mr. Mll..LS. Mr. Speaker, at the con clusion of the 94th Congress,  the long  and  distinguished  career  of  a  great  chairman and good friend, F. EDWARD  HEBERT, will come to an end as he re tires from the House of Representatives  after 35 years of service.  The career of the distinguished gen tleman from Louisiana spans a  longer  period than that of any other individual  in the history of that State in the Con gress of the United States, and it has  been a career marked by great accom plishments for his constituents and for  the Nation. He succeeded to the chair manship of  the Committee on Armed  Services during the bitter and divisive  war in Southeast Asia, meeting the chal lenge of providing adequately  trained  and equipped fighting men for that con flict in the courageous manner for which  that great committee has always been  noted. During the trying years of that  war,, we worked together as chairmen in  the Congress attempting to reconcile the  competing interests of national security  with the need to maintain economic se curity at home, and EDDIE's willingness  to resolve the broader issues facing the  Nation at that time while moderating  the military demands enabled the Con gress  to minimize  the economic stress  which otherwise would have occurred.  As for each of us who have served in  excess of 30 years in the House, this is  virtu<~lly the only life that EDDIE knows.  And I know that he will continue to take  an active part in public affairs though  he may have retired from public life.  HON. JOE L. EVINS  HON. JOHN J.

I have  served with RAY on the Rules Committee  since my election to that committee in  1961 and have watched with interest his  steady, conscientious dedication  to the  job, and his eventual elevation  to the  _chairmanship. This was a well deserved  honor after so long a period of service.  He also has set a record for length of  service as Congressman  from  Indiana  and used that time in a never ending  fight for legislation that would benefit  his people.

As a representative of the people,  ""Doc"" MoRGAN must be numbered among  the best. With his retirement from this  great body upon the adjournment of the  94th Congress,  the Republic will have  lost one of its most valuable servants.  His dynamic  leadership as chairman  of the Committee on International Rela tions placed him at  the congressional  forefront of  foreign policy during  the  tenure of five Presidents and five Secre taries of State. The Nation was indeed  well served in having a man of Congress man MoRGAN's caliber to guide us through  the many controversial and critical areas  during  this momentous period  in our  country's history.

340,,94,-0.318,1176,27,Mr. GIAIMO.," Mr. Speaker, a decade  ago, this Congress approved an innova tive approach  to the organization and  delivery of health care through legisla tion providing for regional medical pro grams which focused on the regionaliza tion of health services in the interest of  making quality care available to all at  reasonable cost. The Nation's 56 regional  medical programs were phased out in  1975 and 1976, upon expiration of the  authorizing legislation <Public Law 89239>.  In that 10-year period,  the regional  medical  programs helped  to  improve  America's health care delivery system to  the point that we have today a founda tion on which to build a rational system  for the future. One of the most innova tive and productive regional medical pro grams was that operated in Connecticut  by Dr. Henry T. Clark and Edward F.  Morrissey. Its record of accomplishment,  particularly  in the area of developing  working relationships between university  medical  centers and community hos pitals, is one in which we can all take  pride. Mr. Speaker, I conclude my re marks with a summary statement on the  Connecticut Regional Medical Program  by its last director, Mr. Edward Morris sey:  A TRIBUTE ON THE RETIREMENT  OF HON. PHIL M.

342,,94,-0.599,1254,27,Mr. EDWARDS of California.," Mr.  Speaker, on Sunday, September 26, thou sands of people marched in a tribute to  Orlando Letelier, former Chilean Ambas sador to the United States and a political  exile from his beloved Chile for the past  2 years. The memorial was not only an  occasion to pay our respects to a good  and decent man but also to renew our  commitment to support the restoration  of democratic government in Chile.  The senseless act of terror which took  the lives of Orlando Letelier and his as sociate, Ronni Momtt, is known to us all  and I will not recount it here. However, I  thought it appropriate to share with my  colleagues the moving tribute made by  Peter Weiss of the Institute for Policy  Studies at the memorial services.  The remarks are as follows:  TRmUTE To ORLANDO LETELIEB.  (By Paul Weiss)  He was a freckled redhead. He was a first  rate economist. He was a lusty singer of folk  songs. He was a born diplomat.  He  loved his family. He  loved Chile. He  loved life.  Trust and friendship fiowed to him as nat urally as a fiower unfolds in the spring. Pos turing and didacticism were a.s allen to him  as the Ideology of the  junta. to his native  land.  When he, the former ambassa(jor and cabi net member,  came  into our  freewheeling,  anti-authoritarian Institute for Polley Stud ies-Transnational Institute community some  two years ago, after his ordeal on Dawson  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Island, he was met with mistrust which the  untitled harbor for  the aristocracy. In no  time at all, he emerged a.nd was accepted as  a  leader, because he was  the most equal  among equals.  One of those who had easily come to accept  him was Ronni Karpen Moffitt. She shared  his ideas, his comradeship and his total dedi cation, but she did not know that this made  her a soldier and that Washington had be come e. battlefield.  For all his worldliness and erudition, Or lando was an uncompliacted man. Like most  £ensible people, he was a socialist. But he was  also generous in embracing all those, regard less of class and party, who shared his love  of  justice  and  his  hatred  of meanness  and oppression. There was room in his heart  for decent human beings trapped in inhuman  systems.  To say that we shall miss him is to say that  the grass will miss the sun. But when we are  done with our grief, we shall do what he  would have done had he been the survivor  and we  the victims. We shall in redoubled  measure, dedicate both our love and our fury  to the completion of the many-sided tasks  he had set for himself:  to make the DINA  assassins, and their protectors and counter parts around the world wither under the rays  of merciless exposure;  to free his beloved  Chile  from  fascist  tyranny;  to  sketch,  through the work o! IPS and the Transna tional Institute, the outlines of a  just and  humane internation&l society of the future.  We shall take their filthy bombs, transform  them  into  ideas, organization and united  struggle and  throw  them back  into  their  faces.  We shall do it for our beloved Ronni and  for our brother Michael, who bears the deep est scars of all. We shall do it for Orlando  who was their compa.nero and ours. And for  Isabel, who was his companera and shall be  ours.  October 1, 1976  trust and confidence in the FBI and its  Director, Mr. Kelley.  In order that our colleagues can have  an opportunity to read  the resolution  in its entirety, I insert the following re marks in the RECORD:  RESOLUTION  Whereas,  in recent months  the Federal  Bureau of  Investigation and  its director,  Mr. Clarence M. Kelley, have been subjected  to numerous charges attributed to faceless  sources or to miniscule errors by a few em ployees, and,  Whereas, the allegations have in effect cast  a  cloud over  the  thousands of dedicated  agents and employees of the Federal Bureau  of Investigation, and,  Whereas, these attempts to besmirch the  record of this agency must of a certainty  furnish  the enemies of our society, both  within and outside of the United States, with  a constant source of amusement, and,  Whereas, this harassment 1f continued will  render impotent this the finest intell1gence  gathering and enforcement agency  in  the  free world, now,  Therefore, be  it resolved.  that members  of  the  executive board of  the Louisiana  Peace Officers Association, on this the 11th  day of September, 1976, unanimously  re affirm our support of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation and its Director, Mr. Clarence  M. Kelley, and urge  the President of  the  United States, the Attorney General, and the  Congress,  to give serious consideration  to  the damage done by excessive and unjusti fied criticisms, which together with excessive  restrictions, will  impair,  if not completely  destroy,  the investigative and enforcement  capab111ties of  the Federal Bureau of In vestigation, and urge that this resolution be  printed  in  the Congressional Record and  released to the media.

OF LOUISIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE~  Friday, October 1, 1976  ",1976
343,,94,0.015,1254,27,Mr. WAGGONNER.," Mr. Speaker, the  sudden and continuing rash of charges  against the Federal Bureau of Investi gation and many of  its high-ranking  officials has,  in my opinion,  seriously  weakened the effectiveness of the FBI.  Whether they are proven to be true or  not,  they have damaged  the  internal  morale of the Bureau-the finest crime  investigative agency  anywhere  in the  world.  Recently the Louisiana Peace omcers  Association adopted a resolution urging  the President, the Attorney General and  the Congress ""to give serious considera tion to the damage done by excessive and  unjustified criticism-of the FBI.""  The association quite correctly points  out that charges attributed to unnamed  sources ""cast a cloud"" over the otherwise  good name of the Bureau and its many  hardworking and dedicated employees.  I  completely agree with  the senti ments of  the Louisiana Peace omcers  Association, as expressed in its resolu tion. I hope that this show of support  will go a long way in maintaining public  TRIBUTE TO HERMAN T.  SCHNEEBELI  HON. JOHN B.

Mr.  Speaker, I welcome this opport~mty to  join in the tributes to our departmg col league, my good friend, HERM SCHNEE DELI. HERM  came  the House a  few  short months before I did as a result of  a special election in 1960. We have both  witnessed great changes in the Congress  and the country over those 16 years and  I am grateful for the experience of know ing and working with HERM over that  period. HERM has demonstrated to. his  colleagues over the years that he IS a  man of quiet dedication, infinite wisdom,  and calm and compassionate tempera ment. This institution has received con siderable criticism over  the years and  perhaps even more than ever in recent  times. We have all had occasion to con cede that some of that criticism is jus tified while at the same time speaking  out about what is right with Congress.  When I ten my constituents about all the  hard-working men and women serving  here who are persons of integrity and  courage, HERM  SCHNEEBELI  is perhaps  one of the best examples that comes to  mind as one who gives Congress a good  name.

In her three terms as a Representative,  BELLA has been a  tireless and  impas sioned fighter for causes of great impor tance to the Nation. In working to end  the Vietnam war, control  the bloated  defense budget, save New York City from  bankruptcy, question  the Ford pardon,  eliminate racial, religious, and sex dis crimination,  and direct  national  re sources  toward meeting human needs,  BELLA has served her constituents and  her country well.  To those who agreed with her, she be came a  leader-always knowledgeable,  always  articulate,  and  always out  in  front. Her hard work and unbending  dedication  to principle won her  the  respect of even those who opposed her.  For women in politics, BELLA has been  a trailblazer. She opened doors for those  of us who followed her into the Congress,  and for millions of other women around  the country who are taking an increas ingly active role in government. No more  the  stereotype of  the woman  sitting  quietly by  in  the committee rooms or  caucuses while the men make the laws.  BELLA S. ABzuG has been a unique and  forceful presence in this House. Her in telligence, her courage, her spirit, and  her  lively humor have enlivened  this  Chamber.

Such a  report from the Los Angeles  Times of Tuesday, September 28, 1976,  has been called to my attention by one  of my good friends, Mrs. DeDe McNichol as.

347,,94,-0.218,1397,27,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker, one of my  staff members  recently said that  they  kind Of hoped DAVE HENDERSON WOUld  not be back with us next session because,  she said, ""We might get his office space.""  I reminded her that while we might or  might not  receive HENDERSON's choice  rooms in the Cannon House Office Build ing, no one could take DAVE HENDERSON'S  place, whether it be his office or his place  in the Congress. That is because DAVE  HENDERSON occupies an enviable position  of respect in this body.  DAVE HENDERSON  is a southerner, but  he really has been the forerunner of the  new southerners. Though he has voted  for his district and his  region of  the  country, at the same time, DAVE HENDER soN has been most progressive in his leg islative approach. His leadership on the  House Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee has been most commendable these  past several years. Many of us always  look to see how DAVE voted on civil serv ice or post office matters before we cast  our vote. We knew DAVE would be loyal  to his committee and to the objectivity  of accomplishing a forward-moving leg islation in behalf of civil servants, but at  the same time, we knew DAVE HENDER soN was going to keep a good balance  and not lead us off the deep end on some  kind of high sounding or unworkable  liberalized annuity program. DAVE has a  lot of commonsense and because of that  fact we have been able to follow his lead ership on most legislation coming out of  his committee. You know, Mr. Speaker,  that is not always the case with every  committee in this Congress. Many of us  are rather leary of following some legis lation because of the leadership and as  much as we come from different parts of  the country and some of our folks have  different values from other sections of  the country. DAVE HENDERSON, however,  always maintains a good balance and  that is why we trust him and often fol low him.  A good case in point is the legislation  which affected some Federal judges who  were former colleagues in this House. In  one or two instances, a severe hardship  would have resulted to some of our Mem bers who retired with the promise and  with the agreement years ago that they  would be entitled to a certain annuity  when  they .retired from  the Congress.  Because of rule changes, costs, and other  factors,  there was  the possibility  that  this might have been taken from some  of the Members during this session of  Congress. It was DAVE HENDERSON who  worked out the compromise and made it  possible  that this body keep  its word  with those former Members. Without his  help, that legislation might have moved  forward and caused great hardship and  ",1976
348,,94,-0.355,1423,27,Mr. ZABLOCKI.," Mr. Spea.ker, one of  the most worthy programs authorized  by the Congress is that under title II of  Public Law 480, the food-for-peace law.  Under title II, food is donated to needy  people  abroad,  particularly  children,  through U.S. voluntary agencies and the  world food program, and bilaterally to  other governments. It is devoted to hu manita.rian purposes. Its uses range from  child feeding and food-for-work projects  to assistance in times of disaster.  Because of difficulties for  these pro grams in past years caused by variations  in and uncertainties about the quanti ties of the food supplies to be provided  under title II, the Congress in 1975 put  a. new provision in the food-for-peace  statute. It mandated that a. minimum of  1.3 million tons of agricultural commodi ties be distributed under Public Law 480,  title II, each fiscal year, with a minimum  of 1 million tons of this to be distributed  through  nonprofit  voluntary  agencies  and the world food program.  This new provision was enacted as part  of  the International Development and  Food Assistance Act of 1975. In its report  on the bill, in reference to the difficulties  which have been encountered by volun tary agencies and the world food pro gram,  the Committee on International  Relations noted thatThe minimum is designed to assure avail ability of at least one million tons of food  a year for these programs. thereby promoting  their effectiveness and permitting better for ward planning.  I was,  therefore,  deeply  concerned  upon being advised, in the first instance  by interested citizens outside of the Gov ernment, that compared with 1.3 million  tons programed for title II, actual ship ments in fiscal 1976 were less than 1 mil lion tons. I asked the Secretary of State  for a prompt report on implementation  of the title II minimum provision. The  executive branch response included fig ures indicating thatCompared with 1.315 million tons aP proved in fiscal 1976, actual shipments  under title II totaled only 987,000 tons.  Of the 1.198 million tons approved for  voluntary agencies and the world food  program in fiscal 1976, only 873,000 tons  were actually shipped.  The executive branch apoarently re gards the commodities as ""distributed""  when the programs for their disposition  are ""authorized"" or ""approved"" and the  program  sponsors  are notified. This,  however, does not assure that the pro gram sponsors will draw the full amount  approved for them or that they will ship  the entire allotment within  the fiscal  year. In f:act, I am told that the volume  of actual shipments each year always  runs  somewhat lower  than  the  total  which has been approved.  In fiscal l976, according to the execu tive branch, some of the shortfall below  1.3 million tons was due to a holdup on  ",1976
349,,94,-0.281,1449,27,Mr. SLACK.," Mr. Spe_aker, those of us  who have served in Congress before and  since passage of the Postal Reorganiza tion Act of 1970 have a powerful appre ciation of the problems and controversies  faced by DAVID HENDERSON as chairman  of the Post Office and Civil Service Com mittee.  We recall the assurances that the re organization plan would eliminate all of  the causes of citizen discontent with the  postal system.  We were assured service would be im proved to the efficiency standards of our  Nation's largest public utility system.  We were also assured no necessary fa cilities would be closed.  We were told there would be no need  ever again for a postal rate increase.  Efficiency would be the order of the  day.  We voted for the Postal Reorganiza tion Act with a sigh of relief and we all  know what has happened. Constituent  protest about postal operations probably  rank No. 1 in volume among the com plaints received in congressional offices.  All of this rebounded into the jurisdlc CXXII--2257-Part 27  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  35819  tion of the Post Office and Civil Service  Committee. Under these circumstances I  must join the many Members who ac knowledge admiration and respect for the  manner in which DAVE HENDERSON has  conducted committee consideration of  postal affairs. We will miss his abilities in  this controversial field. He has given a  serious problem his very best efforts, and  I wish him all the joys and rewards of re tirement so richly earned.

JOE EviNs has been  throughout his  career deeply concerned with the average  American-that  everyday  man  and  woman who goes to work or tries to run  a  small business, despite  taxes, crime,  and the vagaries of commerce.

The public works of the U.S. Govern ment and  the activities and economic  well-being of our small businesses affect  the  lives of each and every American  daily.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES BY THE  SUBCOMMITTEE  ON  ENVIRON MENT AND  THE ATMOSPHERE,  COMMITTEE  ON  SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY, 94TH CONGRESS  HON. GEORGE E. BROWN, JR.  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 1, 1976  ",1976
352,,94,-0.288,1462,27,Mr. BLOUIN.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to submit for the review of my colleagues,  the results of a questionnaire mailed this  pas't August to  the constituents of the  Second District of Iowa.  Some of the more interesting aspects  of the results are as follows:  In regard to how the Federal Govern ment should allocate expenditures, 57  percent believe  that more  tax dollars  should be spent  in aiding our senior  citizens and  in energy  research; while  only 13 percent think that more should  be spent in weapons development, and  only 4 percent believe more should be  spent on foreign aid. A very substantial  75 percent and 47 percent think that less  should be spent on foreign aid and weap ons development, respectively.  Regarding  the situation of lock and  dam No. 26 at Alton, Til., a very im portant issue in my district, I recognize  that since the questionnaire was printed  and mailed,  the GAO has revised and  substantially raised the estimated costs of  the railroad and Illinois DOT proposals.  I must acknowledge that the results of  this question might have been different  if  the  information had been available  earlier. Even so, there appears to be a  significant opinion expressed in favor of  holding down the costs as much as possi ble while carrying out any necessary  improvements.  This past year, I  introduced a ""sun set"" bill that would call for the eliminaEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tion of Federal bureaus and agencies  every  ten years unless, under  review,  their continued existence could be justi fied. An overwhelming 88 percent of the  respondents supported  this  idea while  only 6 percent were opposed.  For  the  information of  those who  would have us believe  that immediate  decontrol of oil and natural gas prices  is the answer to our energy crisis, I sub mit that 71 percent of my respondents do  not swallow  that line of reasoning at  all.  Mr. Speaker, without objections, I in clude the results of my questionnaire to  be inserted in the RECORD and I recom mend that my colleagues  take note of  these results. Certainly, my constituents  are demanding that we take a fresh look  at our spending priorities of their tax  moneys, and that we need to carefully  monitor and  restrict  the growth and  power of the Federal bureaucracy:  (Answers in percent)  a.
