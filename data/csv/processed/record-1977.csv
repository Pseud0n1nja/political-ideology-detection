5,House,95,-0.451,97,1,Mr. FARY.," Mr. Speaker, in the few  short weeks that have passed since his  death,  thousands, perhaps millions of  words have been committed to print and  spoken  over  the  airwaves  eulogizing  Mayor Richard J. Daley.  The list of men and women who have  paid him tribute is impressive: a Presi dent,  a President-to-be, Congressmen,  Senators, public figures from every State  in the Union, editors, columnists, and  television news personalities;  all have  contributed in praising this remarkable  man.  Permit me now to add my own humble  but intensely heartfelt words.  I speak of Richard Daley as mayor of  Chicago, and preeminent urban states man of our time, but still more, I cherish  his memory as a constituent of mine and  a personal friend.  The strengths of Richard Daley,  the  public figure, have been amply described  by others, and much of what has been  said is true:  He was a man of immense, irrepressi ble energy, matched only by his ability  to  translate  it into solid achievements  which benefit more than 3 million Chi cagoans every day.  He stood as one of the greatest figures  in the Democratic Party he loved so well,  towering over his occasional detractors.  He was a man whose pride in his home  city know no bounds, and even the casual  observer can see  that it was a  pride  amply and demonstrably  justified. His  love of our country was equally fierce and  unswerving.  Richard Daley was mayor of the city  of Chicago for two decades; the metrop olis itself, in all its vibrance and great ness,  stands as his monument. While  other great cities from coast  to coast  sank into decay, Chicago grew and pros pered under his dynamic leadership. The  Windy City is today universally regarded  as the one great urban concentration in  the United States that really works.  I also knew Richard Daley, the private  man, equally well. He was a humble per son, who walked modestly among his  fellow citizens. He was a loving and de voted husband and father, and a  loyal  son of the church. He came up through  the ranks  the hard way, by his own  strenuous efforts, but he never forgot or  peglected men, women, and children less  fortunate than he. In his characteristic  way, he translated this compassion into  CXX:ITI--7-Part 1  concrete and successful measures which  ease their plight.  Mr. Speaker,  six decades  ago, Carl  Sandburg undertook the formidable task  of defining the essence of Chicago. His  robust words described our beautiful city  well; I think they also describe the man  who served as its mayor with such dis tinction for so many years:  ... here 1s  a  tall bold slugger, set vivid  against the little soft cities; ...  Bareheaded,  Shoveling,  Wrecking,  Planning,  Building, breaking, rebuilding.  ProL<d  to  be Hog Butcher, Tool Maker,  Stacker of Wheat, Player with. Rail roads  and Freight Handler  to  the  Nation.  Now Richard J. Daley is gone. I mourn  his passing, but I  rejoice  in the good  works he has  left behind, and I  take  comfort in the knowledge that he is reap ing his eternal reward.  to  SURFACE MINING CONTROL AND  RECLAMATION ACT OF 1977  ",1977
6,House,95,-0.387,97,1,Mr. UDALL.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  introducing the Surface Mining Control  and Reclamation Act of 1977 on behalf  of myself and 17 of my colleagues on the  Interior Committee.  With the exception of minor modifica tions  assure  compliance with  the  Budget Act and other technical changes,  this bill  is identical to H.R. 13950  re ported by the Committee on Interior and  Insular Affairs during the 94th Congress.  That bill contained a number of changes  and was designed to make the bill more  palatable to the Ford administration and  coal surface mine operators. Unfortu nately, the bill was tabled by the Com mittee on Rules.  But this is water under the bridge. We  are in a new Congress and the new oc cupant of the White House has repeat edly expressed his support for Federal  coal surface mining legislation. During  the last televised debate with Mr. Ford,  Governor Carter indicated that he would  have signed  the strip mining bill Mr.  Ford vetoed. I believe that the President elect understands  the problems of at tempting to increase this Nation's reli ance on its vast coal resources without  imposing  sound  reclamation  require ments. It is appropriate, therefore, to give  the coal surface mining controversy top  priority in the 95th Congress.  Critics  of Federal  legislation  have  argued that a national bill is no longer  needed because mining concerns have  improved  their  reclamation  practices  under strengthened State laws. Frankly,  I have serious doubts that this  is  the  case, but the question of the status of  current mining procedures  is a  good  starting point for consideration of coal  issues in the current Congress.  I have, therefore, arranged for a series  of briefings on the question of reclama tion practices and environmental prob lems of modern day surface mining. On  January 10  and 12-room  to be announced-at 9:45 a.m., members of the  Interior Committee of the 94th Congress  will receive comments from a variety of  citizens and coal operators on these is sues. Formal hearings on the legislation  itself will be held at a later date and we  plan to receive testimony from the broad  spectrum of  interested parties,  includ ing Federal, State, and  local ofiicials,  electric  utilities  as well  as  industry  spokesmen, environmental organizations,  and citizens.  The  initial briefings on January 10  and 12 will not interfere with the ability  of interested parties to contribute to the  legislative hearing record. But we need to  get started and we can make good use of  our spare time during this period of or ganization by taking a look at the prac tices and problems of current coal sur face mining procedures.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to invite my  colleagues who are interested in the is sue of coal surface mining to participate  in this briefing session. If any of my col leagues desire  to attend the meeting I  would ask them to direct their staff to  contact the Interior Committee at exten sion 58331 so that appropriate arrange  ments can be made.  Mr. Speaker, I would also add that I  am aware that the legislation I am intro ducing  today  is not viewed as beyond  improvement by those interested in this  issue. The  environmentalists want  a  tougher bill and the coal industry be lieve many of its provisions are onerous.  In general, I believe that the legislation's  reclamation  requirements  and  proce dures are sound but this is a new Con gress and a  fresh  look at a proposed  statute never hurt any legislation. This  bill does represent, however, the most re cent best efforts of the Interior Commit tee and  is,  therefore,  the most logical  starting point for our deliberations. Our  briefing sessions and later hearings will  help evaluating the merits of this bill and  carry out our responsibility to address  this issue that has affected coal develop ment for too many years.  INTRODUCTION OF TENANTS' TAX  JUSTICE BILL  ",1977
7,House,95,-0.324,97,1,Mr. HARRIS.," Mr. Speaker, along with  42 of my colleagues, I am today intro ducing the tenants' tax justice bill which  allows  tenants to claim their share of  local and State property tax payments  for Federal income tax purposes.  Tenants pay property taxes on their  dwelling units through their rent pay ments, but unlike homeowners, they are  not allowed to claim their property tax  payments for Federal income tax pur poses under current law. Because of this  inequity, the Federal income tax liabil ity is greater for tenants.  I believe that since the tenant actu ally pays State and local property taxes,  the tenant should have the same right  as the homeowner to claim the property  tax payment. The tenants' tax justice bill  provides a credit for tenants of 25 per cent of the property tax payment. For  ",1977
8,House,95,-0.506,110,1,Mr. BROWN of California.,"  Speaker, I rise to note the reintroduction  of the Automotive Transport Research  and Development Act which was passed  by the 94th Congress last September, and  subsequently vetoed by President Ford.  As you know, the veto of that bill, H.R.  13655, was overridden by the House on  September 29 by a vote of 293 to 102, but  sustained by the Senate. Since the Senate  had voted in favor of this, or similar leg islation on four previous occasions by  more  than  two-thirds majority,  it 1s  fairly clear that the vote to sustain the  President's veto had little to do with the  merits of the bill. In addition, the Senate  did vote to override the veto of the com panion bill to H.R. 13655, H.R. 8800, the  electric car bill, only 1 week earlier.  Since the House did vote to override both  vetoes, it is logical to expect continued  support in the 95th Congress for this  legislation.  I  basically consider  the Automotive  Transport Research and Development  Act of 1977 to be an item of unfinished  business from the 94th Congress. Similar  legislation has been introduced, and ac tively considered since early 1973 in both  Houses of the Congress. If we had en acted such legislation in 1973, we would  be nearing the completion of the R. & D.  ",1977
9,,95,-0.453,201,1,Mr. MEEDS.," Mr. Speaker, on several  occasions, I have stood before the House  of Representatives and stressed the ex tremely serious ir.lpact of the 1974 Boldt  fishing-rights decision on the people and  the economy of the Pacific Northwest.  That ruling, handed down by Federal  District Court Judge George H. Boldt on  February 12, 1974, was based on Indian  treaties signed by the Federal Govern ment during the mid-1800's in the Pa cific Northwest. The treaties allowed the  tribes the right to take fish at all their  usual and accustomed grounds and sta tions, in common with all citizens of the  territory.  Judge Boldt  interpreted the treaties  to mean that certain tribes in the Pacific  Northwest have the right to take up to  50 percent of the  harvestable runs of  steelhead and salmon in State waters.  That ruling was upheld by the U.S. Ninth  Circuit Court of Appeals on June 4, 1975,  and by the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan uary 26, 1976, when it refused to hear  the case.  To say the least, the Boldt ruling has  placed tremendous new demands upon  an ever-diminishing  resource and has  thrown considerable confusion into our  fishing industry.  Previously, I have explained the im pact of  the  ruling on  the  industry which is one of our most important in  our State. I have told of its serious im pact on the size of the fish runs, and  the growing threat of depletion.  Perhaps most importantly, however, I  have stressed how  this ruling has af fected our people and our human rela tions in the Northwest. I have pointed  out how this decision has, in many in stances, resulted in confusion, confron tation, and even violence; how lawbreak201  the  the  rule,  than  rather  ing seems  exception.  Let me assure the Members of Con gress  that since  I  last spoke of  these  problems, they have not subsided. In fact,  they have worsened.  Lack of management, poor regulation,  as well as bitterness, anger, and frustra tion continue to threaten fish runs and  endanger lives. Lawbreaking and violence  are common. Relations among Indians  and non-Indians are strained.  ACTION DUE  is  to  In  Mr. Speaker, this situation in Wash ington State cannot and must not con tinue.  A  precious  resource  is  threatened;  hundreds of  livelihoods are at stake;  violence  and  confrontation  are  con stantly around the corner. We must come  up with answers soon.  If not, we might well witness the dis appearance of one of the most valuable  resources in the Northwest.  Therefore,  I believe  it  imperative  that the Congress of the United States  become more directly involved in efforts  to help find solutions  to  the fisheries  controversy in my region.  Although such action might have been  disruptive  or  potentially misdirected  prior to final action by the courts, I do  believe it is now necessary. The courts  have acted; it is now up to Congress. I  have taken this position before; I reit erate its importance now.  fact,  solutions  our  fishing  troubles must be one of the highest pri orities of the 95th Congress.  Toward that end, Mr. Speaker, I am  today introducing in the House of Rep resentatives, a bill designed as a vehicle  to provide some of those answers.  The bill would set up a commission to  explore the impact of the Boldt ruling on  the Northwest and would make specific  recommendations  to Congress on  the  steps necessary to solve those problems.  It would recommend the very best sys tems for management, for enforcement,  for planting fish, and so on.  The commission would be comprised  largely of local people-people from the  Northwest. Commercial and sports fish ermen, who are feeling the brunt of the  ruling most directly, would be included  on the commission as active members.  It would also include representatives of  the Indian tribes, the State and Federal  Governments, and experts in the fisher ies field.  All would have a chance to speak-to  have their voices heard. All would be ac tively involved in jointly working out so lutions to these fisheries hassles.  DUTms  The commission would explore the en tire fisheries controversy. It would look  at the problems. their causes, and how  best to solve them. It would explore the  impact of the Federal court decision by  Judge Boldt and what it means to the  people of our area. Finally, and most im portantly, it would suggest specific ac tions to Congress on how to solve these  problems.  ",1977
10,,95,-0.225,214,1,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker, I am  today reintroducing four bills from the  94th Congress which fall under the juris diction of  the House Post Office and  Civil Service Committee, of which I am  a member.  The first of these bills would require  that once again the Postmaster General  and the Assistant Postmaster General be  confirmed with the advice and consent  of the Senate. Since the Postal Reorgani zation Act of 1971, the.Se offices have been  filled by persons solely appointed by the  Postal Service Board of Governors. Thus,  while Congress has been  struck with  Postal Service mismanagement and defi cits, it has had no say in the appoint ment of those who have managed to cre ate the deficits. I think my bill represents  one of the steps which must be taken to  correct this situation.  The second bill I am putting in the  hopper today abolishes the congressional  franking  privilege  and  puts  postage  meters in each congressional office. The  bill would  serve  two useful purposes:  First, it would create a system of total  accountability  for mail  sent by  each  Member of Congress. Second,  it would  eliminate the abuses of the congressional  frank like those which have previously  occurred and make it clear to the aver age citizen that congressional mail is not  free and unaccountable.  The third measure I am introducing  is the Federal Statistical Activity ConEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  trol Act of 1977. This measure will pro vide  the Federal Government with a  mechanism  to bring under control our  Nation's paperwork burden. This bill  contains the following provisions:  First, it imposes a ""sunset principle""  on all Federal authority  to collect or  process information for statistical pur poses. Under the bill's provision, every  statistical authority shall terminate at  the end of a 5-year period beginning with  the effective date of the legislation, or in  the case of new authority, 5 years after  its effective date.  In other words,  the  forms or questionnaires are going to have  to prove ,their necessity every 5 years or  go out of existence.  Second, my legislation recognizes that  Congress must bear much of the blame  for the glut of data demands, because it  all too frequently gives little or no at tention to the data implications of legis lated requirements for program report ing, for application for participation in  programs, or in mandated studies and  reports.  Therefore, my legislation requires that  each committee of Congress shall pro vide a detailed data impact statement to  accompany any piece of reported legis lation which provides for Federal infor mation  authority.  Such  a  statement  would include: First, the nature of the  information a respondent would have to  collect, process, or provide; second, the  method by which such information would  be collected;  third, the estimated costs  both to respondents and the Government  to provide and collect the information;  and fourth, alternative methods for col lecting such information.  These provisions would, at least, get  the Congress thinking about the poten tial imoact of its legislation before it be comes too late.  Some may believe that this issue is too  small to cause great concern. Such a no tion is clearly inappropriate when one  considers that in recent years the ""data  and statistics business"" has grown so  much that the total cost of providing the  information that Government agencies  ask for has been estimated to run as high  as $40 billion annually.  Mr. Speaker, the fourth measure which  I am reintroducing  is  the Agricultural  Census bill. I am happy to say that Rep resentatives CHARLES ROSE, GILLIS LONG,  and PAUL SIMON are cosponsoring this   bill. These Members assisted me greatly  when this bill was before my Subcom mittee on Census and Ponulation  last  year. In the 94th Congress, this measure,  H.R. 14830, was reported to the House  floor by the House Post Office and Civil  Service Committee late in the second ses sion. Unfortunately, although there was  widespread support for the bill's passage,  time was too short for its enactment.  The most recent Census of Agriculture  met with great  resistance  throughout  rural America because of the unreason able burden it placed on farmers. Farm ers were required to fill out forms which  were too long, too complex, and toQ ir relevant. While it is important that reli able agricultural information be collect ed and published regularly, it is neither  necessary nor desirable for farmers to be  forced to fill out incredibly detailed forms  January 4, 1977  which ask questions for which farmers  just do not have answers. It simply ap pears as if much too little thought and  effort went into considering the average  farmer's time and frustration in filling  out these forms.  The result was an agricultural census  which is a marketer's dream, but a farm er's nightmare. I believe that now is the  time to deal with this issue before plans  are made for the next Census of Agricul ture which will be taken in 1979.  My bill would r~duce by at least 40  percent the paperwork burden placed on  respondents  to the agricultural census.  The net result of the bill will be to re duce by at least 1.5 million hours  the  time needed by American farmers and  ranchers to fill out Government forms.  To meet this requirement, the Bureau of  the Census would be forced to cut the  size of  its questionnaires and to make  much greater use  of  sampling  tech niques--something it should have been  doing all along.  The bill would also do two other things.  First it would require the Bureau of the  Census  to continue  to collect certain  limited information on very small farms,  and  to  continue  to consider  them as  farms. Last Congress, the Bureau of the  Census and the Department of Agricul ture wanted to increase by 400 percent  the minimum sales required for an es tablishment to be considered as a ""farm.""  This would have resulted in hundreds of  thousands of farms being technically re defined out of existence.  Because of an adverse congressional  response to this redefinition, the action  was later rescinded. But I think that the  Congress ought to preclude any further  attempts  to  redefine  large number of  farms out of existence. Therefore,  the  bill provides that any future changes in  definition which would increase the sales  to qualify as a farm cannot exceed in flationary trends.  Third, the bill recognizes the fact that  there have been great changes  in the  ownership structure of farms in recent  years which are not fully understood or  documented. Therefore,  the  bill  calls  upon the Bureau of the ~ensus to im prove upon its collection of data on the  farm ownership of the United States.  I believe that this bill presents a great  opportunity to reduce substantially the  paperwork burden on a major section of  the economy without damaging in any  way the information needs of our society.

12,,95,-0.254,227,1,Mr. CARR.," Mr. Speaker, today I intro duce a bill that would add the Secretary  of the Treasury t.o the National Security  Council,  reflecting the growing signifi cance of  international economics and  domestic fiscal a:ffairs in the development  of national security policies.  The National Security Council, under  the National Security Act of 1947, has  the function ""to advise  the President  with respect to the integration of domes tic, foreign, and military policies relating  to the national security, so as to enable  the military services and the other de partments of the Government to coop erate more e:ffectively in matters involv ing national security."" Inasmuch as a  sound economy, with a sound dollar, is  vital to national security, should there  not be concern that our Nation's chief  economic officer-the Secretary of the  Treasury-has no  statutory  right  participate in these high level discussions  of national security issues, issues which  today obviously relate to his area of spe cial knowledge and  responsibility and  issues about which all responsible citi zens  are  becoming  increasingly  con to  cerned.

13,,95,0.246,240,1,Mr. FINDLEY.," Mr. Speaker, we all  welcome those occasions w.hen both prin ciple and practicality come together. A  law  to prevent Americans from being  forced  to  retire merely because  they  reach a particular age, usually 65, would  be just such an occasion. It would end  an ugly form of age discrimination, one  of the remaining types of discrimination  in our society yet to be eliminated.  Each year hundreds of thousands of  Americans who want to continue work ing are forced to give up lifelong occupa tions simply because they reach the ar bitrary age of 65.  Many people are well able to contrib ute after age 65 and many do their best  work in later years. Benjamin Franklin  helped draft  the Declaration of Inde pendence at age 70 and was chosen a  member of the Constitutional Conven tion at age 81. Dr. Albert Schweitzer won  the Nobel Peace Prize at 68, Frank Lloyd  Wright designed New York's Guggenheim Museum  at  76,  and Winston  Churchill was  reelected British Prime  Minister at 77. Carl Sandburg wrote  some of his most beautiful poetry in his  eighties, and Grandma Moses was still  painting when she was over 100.  At a  time when our Nation is learn ing to conserve its limited resources and  striving  to  achieve  full  employment  without inflation, we must stop squan dering  this most precious  resource of  all-the skill and experience of senior  citizens. Eliminating  the  injustice  of  mandatory retirement would strength en the  social security and private pen sion systems by letting workers pay in  beyond age 65 instead of drawing bene fits, stimulate economic activity as those  working past age 65  continue  to use  their full purchasing power, and add an  estimated $10 billion  to  the gross na tional product from skilled workers who  will stay  in  the economy.  Stopping forced retirement because of  age has the support of 86 percent of the  American people, according to a Harris  survey. Both justice and common sense  demand  that we  take  this  important  step. That is why, on the first day of the  new Congress,  I have  introduced H.R.  65, a bill to end mandatory retirement.  In the last session of Congress an iden tical measure won the support of 99 co sponsors and received a hearing before  the Committee on Education and Labor's  Subcommittee on Equal Opportunities  chaired by cosponsor AUGUSTUS F. HAW~  KINs, whose foresighted leadership to end  mandatory  retirement  makes  quick  achievement of the goal more likely. This  year, in addition to Chairman HAWKINS,  other members of the Committee on Edu cation and Labor have also agreed  to  cosponsor the bill, including the ranking  Republican, ALBERT H. QUIE, of Minne sota; RONALD A. SARASIN, of Connecticut;  SHIRLEY CHISHOLM, Of New York; JAMES  M. JEFFORDS, of Vermont; MARio BIAGGI,  Of New York; WILLIAM F. GOODLING, of  Pennsylvania; MICHAEL T. BLOUIN,  of  Iowa; and LEO C. ZEFERETTI, of New York.  Much credit should also go to BENJAMIN  S.

ANDERSON  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 4, 1977  ",1977
14,,95,-0.269,240,1,Mr. ANDERSON of California.," Mr.  Speaker, today, I am introducing legis lation designed to increase the availabil ity of air service  for  the elderly and  handicapped, and to improve air service  for passengers using intrastate air car riers in California.  The bill would permit CAB to approve  reduced air fares on a standby basis for  persons 60 years of age or older and for  the handicapped, and would require CAB  to study the economic feasibility of re duced fares for youth.  These provisions would make air tran.c:: portation more widely available to the  public. Every citizen needs the mobility  which air  transportation affords. Un fortunately, however, inflation has placed  air transportation well beyond the reach  of many consumers. The problem is par ticularly severe for the elderly and the  handicapped. Members of these groups  tend to have below-average incomes and,  in many cases they are particularly de pendent upon public transportation be cause they are unable to drive private  automobiles.  The fares now charged for air trans portation  tend  to  exclude  the elderly  and  the handicapped. For example, a  survey by United Airlines showed  that  only 5 percent of  its passengers were  65 years of age or over, while persons  in this age bracket make up 10 percent  of the general population. This disparity  is largely attributable to the low-income  levels of many of the elderly. For exam ple, in 1973 the median income for elder ly households in 1973 was under $4,600,  compared  to  the national average of  $10,500. Similar problems are faced by  the handicapped.  An excellent report on the transpor tation needs of our senior citizens has  been issued by the Subcommittee on Fed eral, State, and Community Services of  the Select Committee on Aging, under  the chairmanship of Congressman SPARK  M. MATSUNAGA. The report points out that  a number of Federal programs, such as  the urban mass transportation program,  include  special provisions designed  to  make transportation more widely avail able to the elderly. In air transportation  there are no programs of this nature,  and under existing law the Civil Aero nautics Board is limited in its ability to  authorize reduced fare transportation for  deserving groups. As a consequence, there  are no reduced fare programs currently  in effect for the elderly.  Chairman MATSUNAGA's  report  also  suggests that well designed reduced fare  programs for the elderly have been high ly successful. For example:  Inter-island carriers in Hawaii ... insti tuted a half-fare for persons aged 65 and  over in 1967, which remained in effect until  1974. During that time one of the can-ters,  Hawaiian Airlines,  reported  a.  340-percent  increase  in  the number of senior citizens  taking  advantage  of  the  fare  reduction.  ",1977
15,House,95,-0.168,331,1,Mr. MAHON.," Mr. Speaker, we were  saddened to learn yesterday of the pass ing of Bob Williams, a former member  of the staff of the Committee on Appro priations. Bob served on the staff from  1933 until his retirement in 1965. A grad uate of the University of Notre Dame, the  National Law School, and a captain in  the Navy during World War II, Bob was  the editor for the committee at the time  of his retirement.  During his 30 years of faithful service,  Bob became-one of  the most accom plished students of this institution that  it has been my honor to encounter. He  was proud of this House and our country  which he loved and we are proud of his  lasting contribution to the work of the  Committee on Appropriations. He spent  many long hours on the job, and it was  not uncommon to see him carrying home  his briefcase full of transcript to work on  late in the evening. Bob continued his  work after  retirement, publishing  two  books, one a historical volume entitled  ""The First Congress'' and  the second  ""The Bulls that Redeemed Me,"" a histor ical novel centered in his native Tennes see. He was indeed a scholar.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the members  and staff of the Committee on Appropri ations,  extend heartfelt. sympathy to  Bob's lovely wife Helen, his son Bob, Jr.,  and his daughter Kate. We on the com mittee will always cherish the memory of  his sparkling wit and intellect.  I  TRmUTE TO LATE HON. LINDSAY  C. WARREN  ",1977
16,House,95,-0.259,331,1,Mr. JONES of North Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, on December 28, 1976, the Hon orable Lindsay C. Warren departed this  Earth. Born in December 1889, he be came a political leader and power in the  State of North Carolina and later as sumed the same position at the national  level.  Not too many Members of this House  assembled here today remember Lindsay  Warren, but the few that might will never  forget his dedication to principle and a  man of uncompromising convictions. He  was elected to the U.S. House of Repre sentatives in 1924 where he served with  distinction for 16 years, and was soon  recognized as a prominent Member of the  House leadership. In 1940, and for 14 ad ditional years he served as Comptroller  General of the United States, and became  known as the ""Watchdog of the Treas ury,"" and according to one newspaper ac count, forced nearly $1 billion of illegal  or erroneous Federal payments back into  the public till.  By any criteria he was a giant among  those in the political arena of this Na tion. Those of us who were fortunate  enough to know him personally could not  help being influenced by this association.  It has been said that few men in public  life have been as colorful and as exem plary in their devotion to the public's in terest as was Lindsay Warren.  It would be to the lasting benefit of this  Nation if each generation could produce  a man with the qualities of the late Lind say Warren.

18,House,95,-0.305,331,1,Mr. ZEFERETTI.,"  The Health Security Act is the prod uct of 8 years of  intensive study and  development by the Committee for Na tional Health Insurance. The committee  is composed of more than 100  leaders  from many fields, including representa tives of labor, senior citizens, church and  consumer organizations, health profes sionals, and public officials.  The bill is based on the principle that  health care should be available accord ing to an individual's needs, not rationed  according  to personal finances or de livered differently according to source of  payment.  To secure health care as a right, the  health security program has two basic  principles. One is to establish universal  and comprehensive  insurance coverage  which provides barrier-free access  needed health services. The second is to  go beyond this traditional insurance ap proach and make serious improvements  in the availability, quality, and cost of  care.  The Health Security Act was first in troduced in the 91st Congress asS. 4297.  The act has been introduced with re finements in both the House and Sen ate  during  each  of  the  succeeding  Congresses.  The Health Security Act of 1977  is  virtually unaltered from H.R. 21 of the  94th  Congress. Only  one  perfecting  change has been made in regard to the  reimbursement  determination  process  for hospitals.  Since  the Committee  for National  Health Insurance began in 1969, the pub lic and congressional support for  landmark  legislation  has  increased  steadily.  This expanding support has occurred  despite -the lack of leadership and re gressive policies of the last two admin istrations. When the Health Security Act  was first introduced, it was foreseen that  enactment might be delayed until there  was a cooperative administration.  This opposition has continued almost  to the present moment with the patently  absurd  reasoning by President Ford's  Council on Wage and Price Stability that  national health insurance would neces sarily worsen  the  inflation of health  costs. The Council's blanket categoriza tion disregards the cost controls and sys tem  improvements which must be  in cluded in a program if it is to succeed.  President-elect carter's position on na tional health insurance is very encour aging. The House sponsors look forward  to working closely with the new admin istration on this issue during the 95th  Congress.  It is becoming increasingly clear that  bold and forceful actions must be taken  to bring about a  reform of our health  care system. This is especially true in re gard to the way we, as families or a na tion, pay for health care.  Support  for  comprehensive national  health insurance arises out of the in creasing  need  to  spend health  care  dollars more effectively and efficiently.  this  ",1977
19,,95,0.679,409,1,Mr. COLLINS of Texas.," Mr. Speaker,  recently I read in the New York Times  of an interesting speech by Prime Min ister Gallaghan. As the head of the Labor  Party he spoke to a labor conference in  Blackpool, England on September 28.  His sincerity and frankness merit at tention of our Congress. We are all aware  of the crisis created by the overspending  of the liberal socialists in England.  I was keenly interested in some hard  factual statements by Callaghan. It is  time that the U.S. Congress started work ing towards a balanced budget and we  need practical legislation in January.  Note his specific comments. Here are  some sections from Prime Minister Cal laghan's speech.  REMARKS BY PRIME MINISTER CALLAGHAN  stlll  For too long this country has trodden the  primrose path and borrowed money  from  abroad to maintain standa-rds of living, in stead of grappling with  the  fundamental  problems of British industry.  We  are,  as  you  know,  borrowing  money. But this time we are not borrowing  to pay for yet another short-lived consumer  boom of the kind which was once supposed  to buy success a.t  the polls-or so we are  told-but which never bought success in the  world's marketplace or in the work place.  When we reject unemployment as an eco nomic instrument, as we do, and when we  reject also superficial remedies, as all social ists must, then we ask ourselves unflinching ly; what  is  the cause of unemployment?  Quite simply and unequivocally, it is caused  by paying ourselves more than the value of  what we produce.  There are no scapegoats. This is as true in  a mixed economy under Democratic Social ism as it is under capitalism or Communism.  It is an absolute fact of life which no gov ernment, be it left or right, can alter.  We used to think that you could just spend  your way out of a recession and increase em ployment by cutting taxes and raising gov ernment spending.  I tell you, in all candor, that that option  no longer exists and that it only worked on  each occasion since  the war by  injecting  bigger doses of inflation into the economy,  followed by higher levels of unemployment  as the next step.  Each time we did this, the twin devils of  unemployment and inflation have hit hardest  those least able to stand them-the poor, the  old and the sick-not those with the strong est bargaining power.  We have  to get back  to  fundamentals.  First, overcoming unemployment now un ambiguously depends on our  labor  costs  being at least comparable with those of our  major competitors. Second, we can only be come competitive by having the right kind  of b:ivestment at the right kind of level and  by signifl.cantly improving the productivity  of both labor and capital. Third, we will fail  if we think we can buy our way out by print ing what the Chancellor has called confetti  money to pay ourselves more than we pro duce.  Let me add one more thing that we are  a  little shy of saying in conference about  industrial regeneration. The wolllingness of  industry tb invest in new plant and machin ery requires not only that we overcome in flation but that industry is left with suf ficient  funds and sufficient confidence  to  make the new investment. When I say they  must have sufficient funds I mean that they  must be able to earn a surplus, which is a  euphemism for saying that they must make  a profit.  And whether you call it surplus or profit,  it is necessary whether we live in a Socialist  economy, a. mixed economy or a  capitalist  economy. If industry cannot generate suf ficient funds to buy its new plant and machinery, then you will not get the investment  and we shall continue to go downhill. These  are elementary facts of life, well-known to  every trade unionist.  You know that we have not been creating  sufficient new wealth as fast as we have  been distributing  it. Over  the  last  three  years, whilst our domestic product has risen  by 2 percent, the increase in our public ex penditures, including central and local gov ernment, has been  18 percent. We have  bridged  the gap  by higher  taxation,  by  borrowing from abroad and, worst of all, by  printing money.  Like everyone in the Lalbor movement,  I  myself believe in a high level of public ex penditure, but we cannot  indefinitely rely  on foreign borrowing to provide for greater  social expenditure, a better welfare service,  better hospitals, better education,  the re newal of our inner cities. In the end these  things will only be provided by our own  efforts.  OSHA COURT CASES  HON. GEORGE HANSEN  OF IDAHO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 6, 1977  ",1977
20,House,95,-0.481,422,1,Mr. REUSS.," Mr. Speaker, Representa tive Gn.LIS LONG, chairman of the Joint  Economic Committee's Subcommittee on  Inter-American Economic Relationships,  has been called by the press ""an emerg ing voice on La tin American policy in  the Congress."" From my association with  him on the Joint Economic Committee, I  know his  long  interest  in promoting  greater  understanding  between  the  United States and our South American  neighbors.  In a speech to the International Trade  Mart in New Orleans, Louisiana on No vember 5, 1976, and printed in the De cember 15 issue of ""Vital Speeches,"" Mr.  LONG has produced a thoughtful analysis  of concerns about development assist ance and United States-Latin American  Relations. The text of the article follows:  UNITED STATES/LATIN AMERICAN, RELATIONS  TOWARD A POLICY OF MUTUAL RESPECT AND  MUTUAL ADVANTAGE  (By GILLIS W. LoNG, U.S. Representative from  Louisiana.)  It seems to me there couldn't be a. better  time  to discuss  the  road ahead  in  inter American relations than right after a Presi dential election.  I  hope you111  excuse my  partisanship, but Governor Ca.rter's Victory  will provide, I  feel, a much-needed change  in many of our policies both domestic and  foreign. Certainly in no area is there a more  urgent need for reassessment than in our  policies toward the Third World, and partic ularly those that affect Latin America. That  need is recognized in the title of this Seminar.  When  I  took  over  the  Inter-American  Economic Relationships Subcommittee of the  Joint Economic Committee last spring, the  first thing I discovered was that many peo ple  perceived  the United States  lacking  clearly-enunciated pollcy--economic or oth erwise-toward Latin America and the Carib bean. Over the past decade, I was told, rela tions between the United States and Latin  America. had suffered because of the more  pressing problems we had in other parts of  the world. We had resorted to using slogans  to describe our Latin American policy. The  Democratic ""Alllance for Progress,"" the Re publican  ""Mature Partnership,""  and  the  ""New Dialog"" all came and went. But, an ef fective policy cannot be based upon catchy  words and a passing pat on the head. More  recently, a policy appears to be formulating  that, I believe, offers real promise. I  give a  great deal of this credit to our friend Assist ant Secretary Shlaudeman. Also, with  the  cessation of hostilities in Vietnam and les sening of tensions in the Middle East Secre tary Kissinger has had more time to give his  attention to a number of complaints of Latin  American and other Third World countries.  The long list of initiatives that the Admin istration has offered  in response  to  these  complaints does not yet add up to a pollcy.  However, they can serve as a .starting place  from which the United States can move in  a. decisive and positive manner.  Congress has often been accused of being  the stumbling block for enhanced relations  with those countries by not coming forward  with appropriations or approving various Ad ministration proposals. I am not trying to  absolve Congress--certainly  there  is much  my colleagues and I can do-and some things  done were wrong~but to blame Congress  alone is a cop-out. It seems to me tha.t for  a  long time we have been lacking clearly defined goals.  I am very hopeful that the Carter Admin istration will develop  these clearly-defined  goals. I have been impressed by the quality  of people who have counseled President-Elect  Carter on foreign pollcy. Within  the next  few days, I will recommend to him that he  look for in his appointee a.s Secretary of State  a person with a broad general knowledge of  economics and that the other people that  he places in key foreign policy-making posi in  background  international  tions have a  economics.  I am dong this because I am convinced  that the entire spectrum of our foreign pol icy has at its roots fundamental questions  of economics. These questions permeate all  other facets of international affairs.  Last summer, my Subcommittee reviewed  a  number of  issues  relating  to U.S.-Latin  American economic  relationships.  In  fact,  ",1977
21,House,95,-0.406,435,1,Mr. MURPHY of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, today I am introducing legis lation  to prqvide comprehensive, equi table and rapid compensation for  the  victims  of  automobile  accidents. The  bill, which  is essentially  the same as  the bill which was reported by the Con sumer Protection and Finance Subcom mittee  in  the  94th Congress, would  achieve these goals by providing uniform  standards  for State  no-fault  benefit  plans.  .  Rarely has a subject been as thoroughly  studied and tested as the rna tter of how  best to compensate automobile accident  victims. Pursuant to a joint resolution of  the Congress, the Department of Trans portation studied the fault and liabil ity--or tort--insurance system of com pensation which existed in all 50 States  in the late 1960's. The result was a dev astating 26-volume  indictment of that  system, which concluded as follows:  In summary, the existing system m serves  the accident victim, the insuring public and  society. It  is  inefficient, overly costly,  in complete  and  slow.  It  allocates  benefits  poorly, discourages rehab111ta.tion and over burdens the courts and the legal system.  The DOT study, which was published  in 1971, recommended that the fault and  liability  insurance system be  replaced  with a nonfault system.  It described  what the ultimate configuration of such  a  system might  look  like  following a  suitable period of experimentatioD and  testing:  This system .  . . should be based on uni versal, compulsory first-p1:!.rty  insurance for  all motor vehicle owners covering all eco nomic losses above voluntarily accepted de ductibles.  .  .  . Victims  should  retain  their  present right to sue in tort' for specific in tangible losses, but the right should be re stricted to the truly serious C'a.SeS.  In recommending State experimenta tion, the study suggested that-state experience with diverse plans will  provide us with that opportunity for pilot  project testing which must precede massive  reform.  In 1970, Massachusetts adopted  the  first State no-fault law and in 1972, the  National Conference of Commissioners  on Uniform State Laws :fleshed out the  DOT  recommendation  by  drafting  a  comprehensive model State law. Today,  24 States have revised their motor vehi cle reparations laws in one form or an other-usually in  the other. American  trial lawyers-who earn more than $1.5  billion a year from automobile personal  injury litigation-have been so successful  in resisting State efforts to adopt good  no-fault laws that only one law-that of  the State of Michigan-even remotely  resembles the model law drafted by the  commissioners on uniform State  laws.  That law is working extremely well to  achieve the humanitarian objectives of  no-fault and to retain fiscal  integrity,  while all the other compromised laws are  failing--or on the brink of failing-to  achieve one or the other of those basic  objectives. There is little or no prospect  that these laws will be improved in the  foreseeable future.  The matter of fiscal integrity was ad dressed in a cost study sponsored by the  National Association of Insurance Com miSsiOners  and  the Department  of  Transportation in 1973. The study con cluded that legislation similar to that  which I am introducing today would be  fiscally sound and would save the aver age insured driver about 10 percent on  his or her premium.  In the meantime, beginning in 1971,  House and Senate committees have held  hearings that run to some 7,703 printed  pages. These hearings-combined with  the State experience-clearly reveal that  the only way that the people will become  the beneficiarfes of the good no-fault law  recommended by the commissioners on  uniform State laws is for the Congress  to pass  legislation which provides  for  uniform standards  for State no-fault  benefit plans.  introducing  this  legislation.  as  chairman of  the Consumer Protection  and Finance Subcommittee which has  jurisdiction over this subject matter, I  think it is important to share with my  colleagues a more detailed examination  In  of the failures of the fault and liability  insurance system, of the predictable fail ure of the bad State laws, and of the  benefits that can be gained through en actment of this legislation, which very  closely parallels the model State law and  the highly sucessful Michigan. no-fault  law.  DEFICIENCIES IN THE AUTOMOBU.E TORT  LIABU.ITY INSURANCE SYSTEM  When a person buys automobile liabil ity insurance, he is not buying protection  against losses he might sustain in an ac cident. Rather, he is buying protection of  his assets against the claims that some one else  injured in an accident might  bring against him on the grounds that  the accident was his ""fault"" under the  law of torts.  The process of recovering for an injury  through this system is time consuming  and costly, involving four basic prerequi sites.  First,  the victim must  identify and  show that the other driver was at fault.  Identification  is  important because a  victim cannot recover if the other driver  should leave the scene of the accident  without being  identified. In single car  crashes,  obviously,  there  is  no other  driver and, therefore, no recovery.  second, the victim must show that he  was without fault or less at fault than  the other driver. Twenty-one States and  the District of Columbia still maintain  the doctrine of contributory negligence,  which denies a victim any recovery  if  he was the least bit at fault. The other  29 States have comparative negligence  doctrines which permit recovery on the  basis of a weighing of the relative neg ligence of the parties involved.  Third,  the  victim  frequently must  bring and win a lawsuit. In 1967, accord ing to the Department of Transportation  study, seriously injured victims or their  survivors had to wait an average of 19  months for final payment. In the interim,  of course, they had to pay for all of their  losses unless they had other insurance  coverage; for example, automobile med ical payments or health insurance, which  pay without regard to fault.  Fourth, the party at fault must have  sufficient insurance or other financial re sources to pay for the victim's loss. The  underinsured person who lacks other fi nancial resources may not have enough  money to cover the victim's losses. The  uninsured driver who lacks other finan cial resources can provide no relief, so the  victim can recover only through his un insured motorist  coverage, which  in  many cases is inadequate to pay for seri ous economic losses.  In addition to being slow and costly approximately $1.5 billion out of some  $8.6 billion of annual premiums for pri vate passenger bodily injury liability in surance goes to attorneys, representing  either the plaintiff or the defendant- the  tort/insurance  system has major  compensation gaps where innocent peo ple do not recover a penny. An innocent  victim cannot recover if the other driver  is also innocent. Such would be the case  where two cars, properly driven, collide  on a slippery road, r.esulting in the loss  of eyesight by one driver and the loss of  a leg by the other. Since both parties op",1977

24,Senate,95,-0.483,513,1,Mr. METCALF.," Mr. President, I was  greatly  heartened  by  President-elect  Jimmy Carter when, during the course  of his final television debate with Presi dent Ford, he stated unequivocally that  he would have signed the strip mine bill  which Congress twice sent to the White  House, only to see it twice vetoed. As far  as I am concerned, this statement by our  new President was one of the high points  .of  the whole  election  campaign.  It  showed clearly that Jimmy carter is a  man who will not kow-tow to the econ omic moguls when it comes to preserving  our  environment  and  protecting  the  rights of the ordinary people of this Na tion.  It would serve no useful purpose for  me  to  recapitulate  the sorry story of  how  the Ford  administration  joined  forces with powerful and  reactionary  corporate  interests in the mining and  utility industries to defeat the strip mine  bill. I will spare you a review of the long,  CXXIII--33-Part 1  painful process by which  this bill was  fine-tuned. It is in fact designed to meet  the need for preservation of our land  and water resources, for stabilization of  our long-neglected coal industry, and for  satisfaction of a national determination  that our enormous coal deposits be ex ploited expeditiously so as to fill the en ergy gap caused by our declining domes tic oil and natural gas reserves.  With a new President, who fully ap preciates  the validity of the approach  adopted by Congress, it is now time to  get a  law on the books so that we can  establish a rational and uniform system  of reclamation out on the mountains and  plains where every week  thousands of  acres of land are being strip mined, often  with disastrous results.  Mr. President, upon completion of the  reorganization of the Senate, hearings  will be held at an early date on  this  vital bill. Our new President should have  the opportunity to sign this legislation  during his first year in o:m.ce.  I am, therefore, introducing today the  Surface Mining Control and Reclama tion Act of 1977. This bill is substantially  the same as the measure vetoed by Presi dent Ford  in 1975. The principal dif ferences are as follows:  First. State mining and mineral re sources institutes. Old title III has been  deleted and in section 102(1)  reference  to research and  training purposes has  been eliminated accordingly. The broad  scope of  the proposed institutes would  be better encompassed within a separate  bill. I plan to introduce such a bill soon.  Second. Designation of lands unsuit able for noncoal mining. Old title VI has  also been deleted. The problems it ad dressed are outside the scope of a sur face coal mining bill.  Third. Reclamation fee. The reclama tion fee in section 301(d) has been made  to apply only to Federal coal in order to  avoid any question as  to whether the  constitutional constraint on origination  by the Senate of bills providing for the  raising of revenues would be applicable.  Fourth. Orphan lands program. Vari ous changes in the orphan lands program  in title m have been  incorporated to  enable State  regulatory authorities  to  participate more fully in the reclamation  of orphaned lands. Also, reference to the  Interior Secretary's  land development  authorization  in section 305 has been  deleted as being unnecessary. Many of  these changes were adopted by the House  Interior Committee during the last Con gress.  Fifth. Special treatment. The special  provisions for anthracite coal mines in  old section 529 and for Alaska coal mines  in old section 708 have been deleted as  unnecessary.  Sixth. Surface owner consent. The pro visions granting  the owner of private  land overlying Federal coal a veto power  over surface mining  (old section 714)  have been deleted. They have been re placed by the provisions of the original  Senate bill  (S. 425, 93d Congress), the  so-called Mansfield amendment, which  impose a ban on the surface mining of  Federal coal underlying privately owned  surface. This will protect ranchers and  farmers without giving them control over  public resources.  Seventh. state regulation of surface  mining of Federal coal. States with fed erally approved surface mining programs  would be permitted to regulate all coal  mining in the State, including operations  on Federal lands. <Section 423 (c).) If a  State decides to regulate mining of Fed eral coal,  it would  receive additional  funds in an amount equal to the savings  to the Federal Government. I believe this  new approach will simplify development  of Western coal. At the same time, it will  protect the Federal Government's inter est by requiring reclamation standards  in a Federal law and providing continu ing Federal oversight of each State's en forcement of these standards.  Eighth. Federal coal exploration. The  provisions for coal exploration permits  on Federal lands have been deleted, be cause  similar provisions were enacted  into law last year as part of the Federal  Coal Leasing Amendments Act.

25,Senate,95,-0.465,513,1,Mr. HASKELL.," Mr. President, I  join  Senator METCALF in sponsoring the Sur face Mining Control and Reclamation  Act which he has introduced today.  The Congress has been working on this  much-needed legislation for over 4 years.  During  that  time,  it has passed both  Houses twice by overwhelming margins  only to be vetoed by the President. On the  second such occasion,  the House came  within three votes of overriding the veto.  Federal surface mining legislation is  long overdue. It has been supported by  almost  two-thirds  of  the  legislature  almost since its inception. Now that we  have a firm commitment from President elect Carter to sign this bill into law, we  should waste no  time giving him that  opportunity.  Federal  standards will not only help to protect  the environment from undue damage as  a result of coal surface mining, it will  assist  in creating  the atmosphere of  regulatory stability which the energy in dustry insists is essential before it can  proceed with large scale energy projects.  I commend Senator METCALF  for his  continued leadership on this legislation.  He has redrafted the vetoed bill in many  respects, however, he has not altered the  all important reclamation standards. I  am in general agreement with most of  the changes which he has made in this  current edition of the bill. However  I  believe that the resolution of the criti~al  issue of  surface owners  rights would  better be resolved by the formula which  was worked out over a  several week  period by the House-Senate Conference  Committee in 1974.  While the so-called Mansfield amend ment language which Senator METCALF  has chosen to replace the surface owners'  consent provision has merit,  I believe  that, based on the considerable diffi.culty  we faced in coming to an agreement on  this issue, we would be wiser to retain the  agreed upon provision.  Therefore, when the bill is considered  by the Interior Committee, I  intend to  offer an amendment which will replace  the ""Mansfield"" language with a pro vision identical to that contained in the  vetoed bill.  look forward with great anticipation  to the day that this bill will become the  law of the land.  surfa~e mining  I  ",1977
26,Senate,95,-0.598,539,1,Mr. PROXMIRE.," Mr. President, today  I am iDJtroducing the First Amendment  Clarification Act of 1977. This bill is al m'OSt identical to a measure I first intro duced in January 1975. Its purpose is to  give the people of the Unit-ed States the  full benefit of a free press, electronic as  well as printed.  MAKE BROADCASTERs EQUAL  We need diversity of ideas, especially  in 'these times when newspapers alre find ing it difiicult to stay in business against  tough economic competition.  Now is the time to make broadcasters  fully equal to publishers so :that the peo ple of this country can have diversity in  the news media.  Freedom of the press was designed for  the benefit of all American citizens, not  just for the benefit of the diisseminators  of news and opinion.  And if the moslt popular of the dissemi nators, television and radio, continue to  be tied down by governmental controls,  the people of this Nation v..-m continue to  be the losers.  Mr. President, my bill is designed to  change this situation.  PURPOSE DEFINED  The first section of my bill defines its  purpose:  to recognize and confirm  the  applicability of the first amendment to  broadcasting and to strengthen and fur ther the objectives of the first amend ment. That can be accomplished by re movtng the statutory and regulatory re strictions placed on broadcasters who  operate under the Communications Act  of 1934.  Section 2 of my bill deals with  the  definition of ""public  interest, conven ience, and necessity"" under which broad casters operate. Right now, that phrase  in the Communications Act  is used  to  make broadcasters accountable  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  after the fact for everything they put on  the air.  t-o  STOP ""RAISED EYEBROWS""  My bill makes it clear that the term  ""public interest, convenience, and neces sity"" cannot be construed  to give  the  FCC j1,1risdiction to require that any per son be provided broadcast time, or to require that any viewPOint be given broad cast time. It further makes clear that the  FCC cannot exercise any power, super vision, or control over  the content or  scheduling of any program or other ma terial broadcast, and  the FCC cannot  comment on or review any of those items.  This latter provision is designed to stop  what has been called  the  raised-eye brow effect used by the FCC to control  and regulate broadcasters indirectly.  SECTION 315 REPEALED  Section 3 of my bill repeals that part  of the Communications Act that permits  the FCC to revoke the license of any sta tion that willfully refuses or fails to allow  a  candidate for Federal office  to buy  reasonable amounts of broadcast time.  Section 4  repeals section 315 of  the  Communications Act of 1934. Section 315  contains both the equal time rule and the  authorization  for  the FCC's Fairness  Doctrine.  The equal time rule requires that when  a candidate for a public office is given  or sold time, any IQther candidate for that  same office must be given an equal oppor tunity. That sounds great. But the equal  time rule is an abridgment of the first  amendment. It is governmental control  over a part of the free press.  The Fairness Doctrine of the FCC re quires that broadcasters afford reason able opportunities fror the presentation of  contrasting viewpoints on controversial  issues of public importance. And that is  incorporated  into  law  through section  315.  Unlike the equal time requirement, the  fairness doctrine does not call for each  viewpoint to receive the same amount of  air time; neither does it require that the  other viewPOints be given in the same  program. That  sounds  fine. But  the  trouble is, even if it were constitutional,  the fairness doctrine is applied case by  case with only the particulars of past  cases to use in judging its application.  SECTION  326  AMENDED  Section 5 of my bill amends section 326  of  the Communications Act of  1934,  which states that there shall be no cen sorship by the FCC and that the FCC  shall not interfere with the right of free  speech. That is fine as far as it goes. I add  the right of free press. That is the key to  putting broadcasters and publishers on  an equal footing regarding first amend ment rights.  Further new language in section 326  will make it clear that broadcasters will  have the right to determine the sched uling and the ,content of their programs  and who shall appear on them so that  the chilling effect of the existence of the  FCC will not be a factor.  PUBLIC  BROADCASTING  Section 6 deals with a first amendment  problem contained in section 396(g) (1)  (A) of the Communications Act of 1934,  which  authorizes  the Corporation  for  Public Broadcasting to facilitate the full  development of educational broadcasting  in which programs of high quality, obtained from diverse sources, are to be  made available to noncommercial edu cational television or radio stations. But  this must be done with ""strict adherence  to objectivity and balance in all pro grams or series of programs of a contro versial nature.""  ",1977
27,Senate,95,-0.384,552,1,Mr. CHURCH.," Mr. President,  today  I introduce legislation to repeal restric tions on the sale of .22-caliber ammuni tion which are part of the 1968 Gun Con trol Act.  In 1969, I supported an amendment to  eliminate registration provisions of the  1968 Gun Control Act affecting sporting  rifles and shotguns. The Congress en acted this amendment into law, thus re pealing the recordkeeping requirements  on  shotgun  ammunition,  ammunition  suitable for use only in sporting rifles  generally available  in commerce, and  component parts for such ammunition.  In adopting this amendment, Congress  supported my belief that the reporting  requirements for sporting firearms cre ated a useless and unnecessary burden on  the Treasury Department, on ammuni tion dealers, and on the Nation's sports men.  Unfortunately these requirements re main for  .22-caliber ammunition as it  may be used for sporting rifles. The leg islation I  introduce today adds .22-cali ber rimfl.re ammunition to the existing  repeal provision exempting other types  of sporting ammunition.  I believe that it is important to elimi nate useless provisions of the law', partic ularly when they are regarded as nig gling Government harassment and petty  paperwork, and significantly in this case  when their enforcement actually hinders  a legitimate Government purpose-crime  fighting. Just as the ammunition restric tions repealed in 1969 were ill-conceived  hindrances to the crime fighting effort,  so are the restrictions on .22 ammunition  which have remained in the law.  What exactly does this recordkeeping  involve? Under the provisions of the 1968  Gun Control Act,  it is unlawful for a  federally licensed dealer to sell or delive.r  ammunition without making a  record  showing the name, age, and residence of  the P.Urchaser. In addition, all dealers are  required to maintain such records of im portation, production, shipment, receipt,  sale, or other disposition of ammunition  as may be provided hy regulations. The  resultant Treasury Department regula tions  require a  license to record: The  date of  transaction;  the name of the  manufacturer; the caliber, gage, or type  of component;  the quality of ammuni tion transferred; the name, address, and  date of birth of  the purchaser;  and  finally, the method used by the licensee  to establish the identity of the purchaser.  Concerning its own .22  requirements,  the Treasury Department has stated:  The record keeping requirements have be come so burdensome that they tend to detract  from the enforcement of the firearms laws.  It is clear that the time and bother to  comply with these requirements cannot  be justified.  This  recordkeeping  has  also  been  found to be totally without value in ef forts  to fight crime. Treasury Depart ment officials have  testified  that they  know of no instance ""where any of the  recordkeeping  provisions  relating  to  sporting-type ammunition including  .22-caliber  rimfire ammunition has  been helpful in law enforcement."" And  the Justice Department confl.nned thatThere is not a. single known instance, as  we have learned from our discussions with  IRS, with the firearms people there, not a.  single known  instance where any of  this  record keeping has led to a.  successful in vestigation and prosecution of a crime.  It is apparent that present restrictions  on .22 ammunition are uSeless, and worse,  a deterrent to the fight against crime by  the waste of effort  their enforcement  entails.  Furthermore, when  there  already so much Government-inspired  complication of our daily lives, repeal of  these restrictions is a fine place to end  a  senseless harassment,  involving  the  most popular type of sporting ammuni tion in the United States.  I hope that the Senate will act favor ablv on my proposal, and I ask my col leagues to join in its support.  is  By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself,  Mr. CURTIS, Mr. STEVENS,  and  Mr. THURMOND) :  S. 31. A bill to amend the Gun Con trol Act of 1968 to provide for separate  offense and consecutive  sentencing  in  felonies involving the use of a firearm;  to the Committee on the Judiciary.  ",1977
28,Senate,95,0.257,552,1,Mr. DOMENICI.," Mr. President, in the  first session of the 94th Congress, I in troduced the same bill I am reintroduc ing today. When I  introduced the bill  then, I reported that a crime of violence  occurred every 36 seconds. Now,  just 2  years later, a crime of violence occurs  every 31 seconds. While at first glance  this may not appear to be a  large in crease, in fact it represents greater than  a  16-percent  increase  in  just 2 short  years.  In 1975, we find that the number of  violent crimes has reached the unprece dented level of over 1,026,000. This rep resents  a  38.9-percent  increase  over  the number in 1970 and a 16.6-percent  increase in the number in 1973. These  are shocking statistics. They  translate  into the fact that in 1975 there was al most a  40-percent greater probability  than in 1970 that any of us would have  been victimized by violent crime.  Nationally, in 1975, firearms were in volved in 66 percent of all murders. In  the Western States this figure was 59  percent, but in New Mexico it was over  63 percent. Nationally, firearms were in volved in almost 25 percent of the ag gravated assaults. In the Western States  this was slighlty over 22 percent, but in  New Mexico it was over 25 percent. Na tionally, firearms were  involved  in al most 45 percent of the robberies. In the  Western States it was 44 percent, but in  New Mexico it was almost 49 percent.  Thus, in two out of the three categories  for which gun related crime statistics  are kept, New Mexico exceeds  the na tional average and  in all  three cases,  New Mexico exceeds the other Western  States. Over half of  the murders and  almost half of the robberies in my State  involve the use of guns.  Yet I do not believe that the answer to  this problem can be found in attempting  to deprive our citizenry of their right to  own guns. Legitimate, responsible home owners and sportsmen should not be  penalized for the misdeeds of others.  The penalties should be placed on the  wrongdoers. They should be swift and  they must be stern. Only by putting the  criminal on notice that his misdeeds will  cost him dearly can we hope to correct  this critical problem.  Therefore,  I,  together with my col leagues, Senators CURTIS, STEVENS, and  THURMOND  introduce today an amend ment to title 18, section 924(c) of the  United States Code that would provide  significantly stiffer sanctions for the il legal use of firearms.  ask unanimous  consent  that  this amendment be  in serted at this point in my remarks.  Mr. President, the bill clarifies the in tent of Congress that carrying a gun be  treated as a  separate and distinct of fense from the felony committed.  In addition, it provides that the pres ent requirements of ""unlawfulness""  in  the carrying of  the gun  be deleted.  Therefore, the act of carrying a gun despite  the  lawfulness of possession will be treated as a criminal act if done  in conjunction with the commission of a  crime.  Finally, the bill dispels all doubt that  carrying a firearm during the commis sion of a felony creates a separate and  distinct  felony  sentencing  for which  must be imposed consecutively with that  of the underlying charge. Sentencing for  the gun charge would be subject to the  sterner penalties this bill contains.  I  ",1977

30,Senate,95,-0.319,656,1,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. Presiqent, I am re introducing a bill which I  introduced in  the 94th Congress-to amend the Social  Security Act to provide for inclusion of  the  services  of  licensed-registered nurses under medicare and medicaid.  Mr. President, the cost of health care  in this country is continuing to escalate  at an alarming rate, and yet many people  still are not receiving the health care  they need. In some areas, health services  are scarce or simply unavailable. We are  moving toward some form of national  health insurance, but we must be careful  that in enacting a health insurance law  we do not perpetuate the deficiencies of  the present system. One step we can  take now to improve the present system  is to provide for better utilization of all  of our health care personnel. In many  areas of the country where there  is a  physician shortage-or where there are  no physicians at all-registered nurses  increasingly are providing health care  services to mothers, children, and fam ilies. The prob_lem is that many services  these nurses are well-qualified  to per form are not reimbursable except under  the direct supervision of a physician.  Home health services to the elderly by  nurses can frequently prevent the need  for costly hospitalization or placement  in a nursing home. But again, medicare  and medicaid, and in fact most health in surance plans, encourage not cost con tainment but the most expensive kind  of care, in institutions.  The nursing profession has been rap idly broadening its  traditional role. In  some rural clinics, nurses have proved  that they can handle up to 80 percent or  more of health problems of patients.  While the scope of nursing knowledge,  skill,  and  experience  has  expanded  greatly, the public perception of the nurse  as  the handmaiden  the physician  tends to persist. The reality is that nurses  are health professionals  in  their own  right-ready and able to function in a  vastly expanded role. It is ironic that our  present health care system and methods  of reimbursement militate against utili zation of nurses  in a way that would  make health services more widely avail able and at the same time contribute to  the containment of health care costs.  The Public Health Service in its most  recent forward plan for health notes the  need for a  reappraisal of medicare and  medicaid  reimbursement policies. PHS  says it plans to study the potential bene fl:ts of greater utilization of nonphysician  professionals including the possibility of  direct payment for their services.  I am glad to see the PHS moving in  this direction, but I do not believe that  to  we need more study of the value of ex tending the use of nurses services and  providing for inclusion of such services  under medicare and medicaid.  In this connection, I would like to point  out that in many cases services now per formed by a nurse practitioner, for exam ple, are reimbursa,ble once they are rec ommended by and/or provided under the  supervision of  a  physician.  In other  words, reimbursement does exist. If the  law recognizes the consumer's right to  have direct access  to nursing services,  then in all likelihood there would be a  reduction in present costs, because of the  elimination of the physician's fees which,  in moot cases, are paid to him only for  supporting the ""claim"" forms.  Two editorials in the Washington Post  last year discussed  the difficulties that  rural communities are having in securing  essential health services. The absence of  such services  is behind  the 22-percent  higher death rate for rural citizens ac cording  to the Southern Rural He.alth  Conference and an infant mortality rate  that is 65 percent higher for rural blacks  than rural whites. Communities seeking  to see that adequate services are pro vided are severely handicapped by  the  fact that medicare does not reimburse  nurses so that unless a doctor is on hand  at a  clinic,  the clinic cannot be reim bursed  for  services  provided  by  the  nurses or others. It loses money and can not pay  its way and many eventually  have to be closed. It is estimated that  some 700  to 800 clinics are needed in  Appalachia to provide adequate care in  that area.  I  believe  that the need for and the  benefits of inclusion of services of regis-,  tered nurses  in all settings  including  nursing homes, hopsitals, rural clinics.  and ambulatory care centers under medi care and medicaid are already more than  apparent. I hope that my collegues will  join me  in moving for action on this  legislation.  Mr. President,  I  request unanimous  consent that the two editorials from the  Washington Post, the editorial from the  American Journal of Nursing, and the  text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill !md  material were ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S.104  Be it enacted by the Senate and HCYUSe of  Representatives of  the United States of  in Congress assembled, That sec America  is  tion 1861 (s)  of the Social Security Act  amended by  inserting  immediately before  the matter  following paragraph  (13)  the  following:  ""The  term  'medical and other  health services   also means all those health  care services performed by a. registered pro fesisonal nurse Within the scope of profes sional nursing practice as defined by State  law."".

DEAR MR. CARTER        We know you're busy packing and studying  and getting ready  to move  to Washington.  You must be  inundated with  letters and  maybe you don't need one more right now.  But frankly, to paraphrase one of your great  predecessors, we're writing not to ask what  this country can do for nurses but rather to  say what nurses stand ready to do to improve  health care and make it accessible to every one in this nation.  We urge you, sir, as you begin shaping your  administration's health policies,  to  include  nurses in the earliest planning sessions. Too  often in the past, only physicians have been  appointed  to represent  the health profes sionals in health policy councils.  Physicians obviously are  the appropriate  choice as spokespersons on the provision of  medical care. But health care encompasses  much more  than medical care. You have  stated repeatedly that you  intend to reor ganize the health care delivery system, that  you will stress preventive services, that you  will remove the barriers that have kept the  poor,  the elderly,  the minorities from  the  services  they require. You have called for  universal, mandatory national health  in surance to cover the costs of these services.  We applaud your alms and Will support your  efforts.  But all of this can only work if our na tional health system is comprehensive, en compassing health maintenance and rehabil itation programs  that stress home health  services and decrease the misuse of expen sive  therapeutic facilities. All of  this can  only work if costs can be contained within  reasonable limits. All of this can only work  if some traditional patterns are modified patterns of health care financing and the  medical monopoly on deciding who shall get  what kind of care.  Let me cite a few examples.  The Smiths are an elderly couple,  living  frugally, but managing, on their Social Se curity income. Ms. Smith awakens one day  with severe pain in her left leg; they take a.  taxi  to  their physician who diagnoses her  condition as sciatica and tells her to take  aspirin and stay in bed for 2-3 weeks. On the  fifth day and again on the sixth and seventh  days, she calls him about her constipation  and he  suggests various over-the-counter  cathartics. On the eighth day she calls again  and he says, ""Well, by now you probably need  a colonic. I guess you'd better come in to the  hospital.""  There is a nurse practitioner in the Smiths'  town who could have come in early and per haps prevented the complication-and cer tainly the hospitalization-but this physi cian,  like most, doesn't think about his  patient's need for skillful nursing care. He  prescribes rest and assumes she can take it  from there. In addition, under present reg ulations, the nurse's services are not reim bursable under Medicare. What Medicare will  ",1977
31,Senate,95,-0.1,695,1,Mr. BROOKE.," Mr. President, in recent  years it has become increasingly appar ent that a large segment of the Ameri can people has lost confidence in Con gress as an institution. Indeed, according  to one national survey taken last year, an  appallingly low 9 percent of those polled  gave Congress a favorable rating.  The causes for public disenchantment  are many. But, in my judgment, a prin cipal cause is the widespread belief that  Congress has been unable or unwilling  to investigate and, if necessary, disci pline,  those Members of Congress who  have been accused of illegal or unethical  conduct. For the truth is that while Con gress is always more than eager to in vestigate members  of  the  executive  branch or the activities of the business  community, it has been remiss in its con stitutional responsibility to  tidy up its  own Houses.  In the wake of a number of congres sional scandals  in the mid-1960's, the  Senate and the House of Representatives  set up their respective Ethics Commit tees. It was a good idea then. And it still  is. But the establishment of the Ethics  Committees was meant to be only a start.  Unfortunately, neither the Senate nor  the House has learned the lessons of the  past decade and consequently, little has  been done to strengthen those commit tees.  The  times demand  that we  respond  now to the legitimate criticisms that have  been leveled at our congressional disci plinary procedures. But a perfunctory  response will not suffice. We must dem onstrate to the American people our re solve, not just our rhetoric, to accomplish  comprehensive reform. Just as the enact ment of the Budget Reform Act in the  last Congress demonstrated our commit ment to fiscal discipline, we must now  demonstrate our commitment to ethical  discipline.  To help accomplish this end, I am in troducing today a package of reform pro posals. This legislation will have three  principal purposes.  First, and perhaps most important, it  would substantially amend the present  procedural rules of  the Senate Ethics  Committee. Among other things the bill  would limit membership on the commit tee to one term and provide a balance  between veterans and younger members;  broaden  the  jurisdiction of  the com mittee;  improve  the complaint proce dures; mandate thorough investigations  and reports on the results of these in vestigations; and provide for additional  staff,  including, when  necessary,  the  appointment  of  independent  outside  counsel.  This bill will give the Justice Depart ment more time to investigate and prose cute violations of the election campaign  law.  In light of the most recent revelations  regarding possible congressional miscon duct and  the need  to prevent future  problems, I hope that the 95th Congress  will address these issues promptly and  thoroughly. Indeed, I hope that the Con gress accords this type of legislation the  highest priority. For, by demonstrating  that it is willing and able to undertake  such genuine fundamental reform, Con gress will be well on the way to regain ing the trust and confidence of the Amer ican people.

37,Senate,95,-0.443,799,1,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I am  sending to the desk a bill to amend the  Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972  in an effort to minimize the risks of fu ture oil tanker disasters.  We have had a virtual epidemic of  tanker accidents over the past month  which has made it evident we cannot  afford a single additional delay without  remedial legislation.  We ended last year with the Nation's  worst oil spill in our waters off Nantucket  and we began the new year with tankers  breaking up, exploding, or disappearing  in the North Atantic.  After the Argo Merchant disaster, my  Subcommittee on Administrative Prac tice and Procedure held hearings  into  that disaster. I stated then my intention  to introduce new legislation.  This bill will do the following:  It will establish an FAA-style traffic  control system for oil  tankers off our  shores.  It will mandate  tanker ownership.  It will establish mandatory naviga tional  equipment  requirements,  con struction  standards  including double bottoms, personnel and operating stand ards. Retrofitting of existing tankers for  the most essential of these requirements  will be phased over a 5-year period.  These standards will apply both  to  U.S. tankers and foreign tankers which  desire to enter our ports.  It will establish mandatory shipping  lanes covering the approaches--out into  international waters wherever a hazard  may exist to require such action-to our  major harbors. The shipping lanes will  be within the 200-mile fishing conserva tion zone established last year.  There will be annual  inspections as  well as surprise inspections.  The time has passed when we could  await final international action on ade quate standards, self-policing by tanker  owners, or vigorous enforcement by for eign flag countries.  Last year, I was pleased to work with  the chairman of the Senate Commerce  Committee and other distinguished col leagues in enacting the 200-mile fishery  conservation zone. That historic effort is  in danger of being covered over with  black muck as a  result of the epidemic  of oil tanker accidents and spills.  In my own New England region, the  livelihood of some 32,000 fishermen and  an annual catch of some $142 million  from the Georges Bank have been placed  in jeopardy by  the recent spill of  the  Argo Merchant.  We enacted the 200-mile'limit in part  to preserve the Georges Bank from over fishing. Now we see a new threat from  pollution  and  the  inadequate  tanker  safety and control systems that exist.  The  Environmental  Protection  Agency, the Office of Technology Assess ment and public  interest observers all  have criticized the past 5 years of failure  to adequately implement the Port and  Waterways Safety Act of  1972. That  landmark  legislation, which Senators  MAGNUSON  and HOLLINGS  championed,  established  a  discretionary  authority  with  the Secretary of Transportation  and  the Coast Guard  to  issue much needed regulations affecting the design,  operations, equipment, speed and prac tices of the tankers that move continu ally toward the United States.  That authority was given after  the  hearings demonstrated that tankers had  been designed and built almost exclu sively for the economic benefit of vessel  owners. No one spoke for the marine and  coastal environment, for the fishermen  or for the public.  The Ports and Waterway Safety Act  provided that authority. Unfortunately,  as  the Senate Commerce Committee  hearings in 1975 and 1976 demonstrated,  and as the recent weeks' tragedies under scored, that discretion has been abused.  Safe tanker operations-as a  result of  improved standards-remains a distant  hope. Not only have accidents and oil  pollution continued, they have increased,  as the recent report by the Tanker Advi sory Center, which I ask to be printed  in the RECORD, underscores.  To date, acting under the 1972 author ity, only  two sets of  regulations have  gone  into effect. One effective on De cember 13, 1976 requires segregated bal last systems but only for new tankers  over 70,00 dwt; the other effective Jan uary 26, 1976 requires that new tankers  over 10,000 dwt be equipped with inert  gas systems. Both rules have followed in ternationally agreed standards on these  matters which were negotiated more than  3 years ago by the world maritime na tions. No other nation, least of all Li beria, whose tankers carry half of our  imported oil, has adopted even  these  minimum standards. US regulations have  not been made final on maintenance,  navigational equipment, propulsion, per sonnel, or any of the other safety fea tures for which regulations are author ized under the Act.  The hearing which I conducted in Bos ton into the causes of the Argo Merchant  disaster and the role of the Federal Gov ernment in this area of concern demon strated again the need for new legisla tion in this area.  For that reason, I am introducing the  Federal Tanker Safety and Marine Anti Pollution Act of 1977.  This bill  requires t he Secretary of  Transportation to issue the safety and  pollution-minimizing  standards which  were discretionary under  the previous  law.  .  By amending  the 1972 act  to make  mandatory  its  thrust, we will  avoid  another 5 years of delay.  First, the bill will mandate the estab lishment of  a  traffic  control  system  modeled on the air traffic control system  we have in effect today both here and  abroad. Either  through satellite radar  or other monitoring, we can follow every  tanker on  its course  in  the 200-mile  zone. The Argo Merchant was not being  monitored when it turned off its planned  course-because there are no mandatory  shipping lanes and no system in place to  monitor tanker movements at the pres ent time. This bill requires the system to  be established.  The Coast Guard not only will know  when a ship is out of those lanes, but it  will be able to inform the ship's captain.  We know that human error is a factor  in some 85 percent of the vessel accidents  occurring in the world. This system will  be a doublecheck on the human being.  And it will make no distinction between  foreign and domestic tankers. It was a  Liberian tanker which broke up on the  Nantucket shores. But could just as well  have been a Panamanian or Honduran  tanker as well.  Once a ship enters our 200-mile limit,  the need to begin the monitoring process  is clear. We want to be able to insure  that shipping lanes will be established as  far out to sea as necessary to insure that  a tanker--once it has been advised it is  outside the lane-will have time to stop  before hitting something. Many of the  larger tankers have a stopping distance  of 15 times their own length.  Second, in addition to monitoring the  ships when they are making their ap proaches, my bill will require that a full  traffic control system,  to minimize the  danger of collisions, be in place in every  major U.S. port. We now have  inport  systems in place in Puget Sound, Hous ton, and San Francisco. Two others are  to be opened this year.  This bill would mandate extension to  the other major ports including Boston.  It includes monitoring entry, movement,  departure, routing, and other maneuver ing and anchoring and mooring require ments.  Third, shipboard navigational equip ment of the most modern category would  be required, including loran C and radio  communications, as well as  the  trans ponder system needed to permit the iden tification of each ship by the traffic con trol system.  Fourth, new tankers over 20,000 dead-.  weight tons, rather than the 70,000 now  in effect, would have  to be equipped  with  segregated ballast  capacity and  double bottoms. Existing tankers would  have to be retrofitted over a 5-year period  with similar requirements, although the  Secretary could waive that requirement  where it would not void the safety pur poses of the legislation. Other construc tion standards would include inert gas  systems.  Fifth,  propulsion  and maneuvering  systems would be assessed as well and  tug assistance required when those sys tems are found not to be adquate.  Sixth, annual inspections as well as  spot inspections would be carried out by  the Coast Guard to cover all aspects of  the new standards.  Seventh, additional personnel licensing  and training requirements would be re quired for U.S. tankers based on National  Academy of Sciences reports. Equivalent  standards would be required of foreign  flag tanker crews.  Eighth, the Secretary of Transporta tion,  through the Coast Guard, would  undertake a new and intensive oil spill  research and prevention program to de velop the technology of how to deal with  potential spills.  This would include experimenting with  the most effective combustion agents and  congealing agents to reduce spill when a  ship has grounded as well as when the  spill already has begun.  ",1977
38,Senate,95,0.631,825,1,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, the highest  level of moral culture is that at which the  people of a nation recognize and protect  the sanctity of innocent human life. All  nations  in which  freedom and  justice  have governed the affairs of the people  have upheld this principle, giving it the  highest priority in their laws and cus toms. Indeed, this principle is the bed rock of Western civilrnation-the one  principle, above all others, which has dis tinguished free and democratic systems  from  the barbaric regimes of the past  and the totalitarian systems of today.  It is for this reason that abortion the taking of innocent human life-has,  until very recent times, been viewed as  violative of this basic principle of  the  Western  tradition. And  it is no mere  coincidence that the modern practice of  abortion first appeared as a  policy of  government  in Nazi  and Communist  dictatorships, where contempt  for  the  dignity of human life is widely demon strated.  Two hundred years ago, a great na tion was founded on principles of human  rights-the right of life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happines. These are the lofty  principles which appear  in one of the  most  important documents  in history,  the Declaration of Independence of the  United States of America. Three years  ago, a dark shadow was cast over this  document when the highest tribunal in  the land, the Supreme Court, ruled that  an unborn child in the womb is not a  person entitled to the right to life, and  may be deprived of life by the mother  and her attending physican. The deci sion has thrown America into a moral  crisis.  Between 1967 and 1970, a number of  States adopted liberalized abortion laws.  During 1971, 30 State legislatures con sidered repealing their respective stat utes, and every State rejected such pro posals. In 1972, Connecticut adopted a  more restrictive law, and the New York  Legislature repealed its liberal statute an act which was subsequently vetoed by  Governor Rockefeller. Also in 1972, Mich igan and North Dakota rejected liberal ized abortion by wide margins in popular  referendums. Clearly, the American pub lic had refused  to continue  to accept  liberalized  abortion  and perhaps had  even decided that the earlier acceptance  of such laws had been premature. How ever,  the Supreme Court re moved consideration of  the  issues  in volved in this national abortion debate  from the States and the public by its rul ings  in Roe  against Wade and Doe  against Bolton. Because of the absolute  position taken by the Court in the abor tion cases and its rigid adherence to, and  indeed expansion of, that position in its  subsequent opinions, it has become ob vious that only a constitutional amend ment will restore le.gal protection to un born children in the United States. Fur thermore, only the amendment process  will return the issue of abortion to the  people for resolution through the rati fication procedure.  in 1973,  II. THE SUPREME COURT ABORTION CASES  In Roe against Wade,  the Supreme  Court invalidated a Texas statute which  prohibited abortions except those neces sary to save the life of the mother. In  its companion decision, Doe against Bol ton,  the Court similarly invalidated as  too restrictive a  liberal Georgia statute  based upon the Model Penal Code of the  American Law  Institute. The Georgia  statute permitted abortion  in circum stances where:  (1) A continuation of the pregnancy would  endanger the life of the pregnant woman  or would seriously and permanently in jure her health; or  (2) The  fetus would very  likely be born  with a grave, permanent, and irremedi able mental or physical defect; or  (3) The pregnancy  resulted  from  forcible  or statutory rape.  The Court ruled that the ability of the  State to regulate abortion depends upon  the stage of pregnancy at Which such ac tion is taken. During the first 3 months  of pregnancy, a State may not inter fere with the abortion decision of the  woman and her physician. During the  next 3 months  the State may adopt  regulations regarding the abortion pro cedure, but only in ways related to ma ternal health. Only during the final 3  months of pregnancy may the State reg ulate abortion except when such action  would interfere with the health of the  mother.  The Court then made such distinctions  meaningless, as a practical matter, by  defining the health of the mother to in clude her ""psychological as well as physi cal well-being."" And by further instruct ing that the medical  judgment of  the  woman and her physician be made in  light of the physical, emotional, psycho logical,  familial, and age  factors  rele vant to the well-being of the mother. In  short,  the Court's definition of health  resulted  in abortion on demand being  elevated  to a constitutional right.  The Court based  its decision on  the  recently articulated constitutional right  of privacy. In the majority opinion, Jus tice Blackmun wrote:  This  right . of  privacy, whether  it  be  founded  in  the Fourteenth Amendment's  concept of personal liberty and restrictions  upon state action, as we feel it is, or .. . in  the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights  to the people~ is broad enough to encompass  a woman's decision whether or not to ter minate her pregnancy.  However, aside from the issue of the  woman's right to privacy, the other con stitutional issue raised in the abortion  cases related to the life of the unborn  child and its constitutional protection.  In determining the constitutional stand ing of the unborn child, the Court laid  great emphasis upon the fact that ""no  case could be cited that holds  that a  fetus is a person within the meaning of  the 14th amendment."" It was further im pressed by the use of the word person in  the Constitution,  finding  that ""it has  application only postnatally"" and by its  view of prevailing abortion practiG:es dur ing the 19th century. One analysis of the  Court's reasoning outlined  its holding  and commented as follows:  Since the text of  the Constitution itself  does not define unborn as persons; and since  American am.tl-abortion laws were once less  (67  By Mr. HELMS:  Senate Joint Resolution 6.

39,Senate,95,0.49,838,1,Mr. LAXALT.," Mr. President, I support  many of the suggestions for reform rec ommended  by  the  temporary  Select  Committee on Committees. It would be  wrong to assume that the following re marks  reflect a blanket  indictment of  this effort. Nevertheless, I am very con cerned about the proposed disposition of  the Senate Select Committee on Small  Business.  Under  the  suggested guidelines  for  committee  restructuring,  the  Senate  Select Committee on Small Business will  be merged, or to put it more accurately  in my opinion, submerged into a larger  committee. Meaningful solutions to the  problems faced by small businesses can not be dealt with adequately in a small  subcommittee that must compete with  other subcommittees for  the attention  of a  full committee  that already has  broad jurisdiction and many other press ing problems to deal with. Considering  the condition of the small business sec tor in our economy today, I believe this  would be extremely unwise.  Those who support such consolidation  do so principally on the grounds that it is  the road to efficiency. We may succeed  superficially  in molding and squeezing  to the pecularities of this body, but is it  :not more  important  to accommodate  the Senate to the requirements of small  business?  Mr. President, this country was built  on a  foundation of small businessmen  and yeoman farmers. Throughout our  history small firms have remained the  basic economic unit ..

40,House,95,-0.128,890,1,Mr. SIKES.," Mr. Speaker, I am very  pleased that the first bill of our colleague  from Florida, the Honorable ANDY IRE LAND, has chosen as his first legislative  effort to introduce legislation honoring  our former colleague, his predecessor, a  great Congressman, Jim Haley. The bill  would designate  the Veterans' Admin istration Hospital in Tampa, Fla., as the  James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital.  I  sponsored  this proposal last year and,  although it was approved in the House,  the Senate failed to complete action on  the measure before  the 94th Congress  adjourned. The  entire Florida House  delegation cosponsored this bill last year  and again this year.  Now, let me take a moment to express  my great pleasure at  the  responsible  manner in which ANDY  IRELAND has as sumed the important work of a Member  of Congress. He has  clearly  demon strated leadership capability and a fac ulty for working cooperatively with other  members of our delegation and of the  Congress. I am convinced that he will  quickly establish himself as one of the  new and progressive young  leaders  in  the House.  The honor which is proposed for our  former colleague, Jim Haley, will be a  proper and fitting tribute for a man who  championed the rights of veterans all  the  years he was  in  the Congress.  Through his tireless efforts and years of  dedicated service on the Veterans' Affairs  Committee,  the  veteran  population  throughout the Nation now has access  to greatly  improved medical programs  hospital  expanded  and  significantly  facilities.  Prior to Mr. Haley's service in Wash ington, he was an outstanding member  of the Florida Legislature and his leader ship talents there also were directed in  considerable measure to legislation bene fiting veterans and their families.  When Mr. Haley came to Congress in  1953, he was assigned to the House Com mittee on Interior and Insular Affairs  and the Committee on House Adminis tration. In 1955, he accepted an assign ment to the House Committee on Vet erans' Affairs. As a veteran, he had a  deep and sincere interest in all veterans  and their dependents. As a Floridian, he  felt that Florida's rapidly growing vet eran population should have representa tion on a committee which  is so very  important to his State. He served on the  Hospitals Subcommittee for 18 years and  was chairman of the subcommittee the  last 8 years. This subcommittee has over sight over the 166 VA hospitals and the  entire VA medical program throughout  the United States.  After becoming chairman of the In terior and Insular Affairs Committee in  1973, Mr. Ha\eY relinquished his seat on  the Veterans' A1Iairs Committee. His new  responsibilities would leave him but lit tle  time  for any other committee as signment and, in his characteristic un selfish way, he wanted to provide an op portunity  for  another Member with  fewer responsibilities to devote more time  to the needs of the Nation's veterans.  During his service on  the Hospitals  Subcommittee, Mr. Haley helped bring  about  the  construction of  three new  Florida Veterans' Administration hospi tals-Gainesville, Miami, and TampSr and the modernization of the VA hospital  facilities at Lake City and Bay Pines.  During  this same period, Florida's VA  hospital beds were increased from 1,353  to 3,501. Congressman Haley's work na tionwide was  equally  important. He  helped to build needed hospitals and to  improve veteran facilities in other areas,  and he was instrumental in preventing  the closing of VA hospitals and regional  offices in areas where he considered their  contributions essential.  In short, Mr. Speaker, Jim Haley fully  deserves this recognition. His many years  of hard work and concentrated efforts  on behalf of all veterans has earned  their respect and admiration. I am very  hopeful that the Veterans' Affairs Com mittee will quickly favorably report this  proposal to bestow the name of a very  distinguished Floridian on a needed vet erans' hospital as proper recognition for  his  long years of service  to America's  veterans and their families. I am con fident  the bill will  again  receive  the  approval of the House and hopefully the  Senate will concur. I know that all of you  join me in wanting Jim Haley to be able  to smell the flowers he so richly deserves.  ",1977

Congressman  ANDY  IRELAND who now represents Jim  Haley's district,  is  today  introducing  to  this measure to honor a gentleman who  was  instrumental  in modernizing  two  veteran facilities in Florida and helped  to bring about the construction of three  VA hospitals in Florida.  A hard worker for all veterans,  this  measure is a most fitting tribute to for mer Congressman  James A. Haley.  I  hope all my colleagues will join me in  supporting its passage.

42,House,95,0.277,890,1,Mr. SEBELIUS.," Mr. Speaker, I am to day introducing 27 individual bills, each  of which proposes  the designation of  wilderness at a particular unit of  the  national park system. These bills repre sent the recommendations which have  come from the studieG conducted by the  National Park Service as required by the  Wilderness Act of 1964. All of these bills  and 13 others were introduced by me in  the 94th Congress. The 13 others were  enacted into law in modified form by the  94th Congress. Hence, I am reintroduc ing  these  remaining 27 bills with  the  hope and expectation that many, if not  most, of these can be acted on by the  95th Congress.  I  recognize  that each of  these bills  involves matters  of  consideration  of  other Members  in whose congressional  district these wilderness proposals are  located. I  introduce these bills without  knowledge of the position of the affected  Members, and I take no advocacy posi tion on any of these bills by virtue of my  introduction of  them. However, as the  ranking minority member of  the Inte rior Committee's Subcommittee on Na tional Parks and Recreation during the  last Congress, I was quite interested and  involved in the consideration of wilder ness  legislation. I  introduce these bills  again today for the principal purpose of  bringing this backlog of wilderness leg islrution back before the committee for  its consideration. I would hope and urge  that prompt action might be taken on  these bills as a priority item this year.

49,House,95,0.378,929,1,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, the  President-elect has stated that he plans  to grant an unconditional pardon to all  Vietnam-era draft evaders. If this pro posed blanket pardon is  invoked, I be lieve the people of our great Nation will  suffer a grave injustice.  The history of our Nation is written  in the blood of those who have died in  defense of our freedom. When that free dom was challenged, our generation and  the generations before us have taken up  the call  to arms;  living, fighting, and  dying so that our children and their chil dren might share that precious freedom.  It has been said that the Vietnam con filet was different from other wars. What  was not different, however, was the in evitable sacrifice by those thousands of  men who fought in it. It is to these men,  both  living and dead,  that  this pro posed pardon would do the greatest in justice. The Government of our Nation  would be saying to those who died, to  those who were wounded, and those who  bore the heat of battle, that they should  not have fought: That evasion or even  cowardice is to be rewarded in the same  manner as heroism. Mr. Speaker, I be lieve  such  an  unconditional  pardon  would set a precedent, which could un dermine our ability to defend ourselves.  Those called to future combat, even in a  national  emergency, would  remember  that this Nation paid no deference to  heroism; that there was no penalty for  evasion. Our armies might not have won  World war II believing that. We could  not hope to win a future war with that  belief.  I do agree, however, that there is a  need to heal our Nation's wounds at this  time. I do not agree that an uncondi tional pardon is the way to do that.  President Ford's clemency proclama tion of September 16, 1974, allowed case  by case consideration for deserters and  evaders, with appropriate conditions and  sanctions. This conditional amnesty re tained the rightfully due honor for those  men who died and suffered. It also al lowed compassion and mercy for those  men who had fled or deserted.  C:X:XIII--59-Part 1  I believe that the President-elect could  grant pardon on a case-by-case basis  which would eliminate those shortcom ings.  I could support the President-elect in  his adoption of conditional pardons, with  specific provisions  for clemency on a  case-by-case basis drawn up by the De partment of Justice. Such pardons, with  clearly delineated provisions and condi tions would eliminate the shortcomings  of the previous program while preserv ing the sanctity of our national honor.  It is that national honor which has  preserved  this country  through many  confiicts. It is only with that honor that  we shall survive the future.  ",1977
50,House,95,0.297,929,1,Mr. BEARD of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  may I  first express my appreciation to  you for giving me  the opportunity  to  present my views on this most impor tant issue. Amnesty raises complex and  emotional  questions  that  necessitate  serious consideration for they will have  far-reaching effects on the very fiber of  our society.  I only hope that President-elect Car ter will reconsider his ill-advised cam paign promise to grant an unconstitu tional pardon to the draft dodgers of the  Vietnam war. I say ill-advised, because  I  think that such an act would, in the  words of one of our former senior mili tary officers, ""be a degradation of our  national moral fiber and military pos ture.""  Throughout  the history of our Na tion,  there have been  those who dis agreed with the policies of our Govern ment and chose not to participate in the  wars in which our country has been in volved. Certainly I  respect  their right  to differ, but they must be willing to take  the penalty that accompanies the break ing of a law of the land; for, make no  mistake--no matter how unpopular the  Vietnam war was; no matter what one's  feelings about it had been-the fact still  remains that draft dodgers are lawbreak ers  and  therefore must  stand  trial,  whether it be in a court of law or before  a special commission such as the one set  up by President Ford in 1974.  We have always prided ourselves on the  fact that our system of justice is one of  ""all equal under the law."" To uncondi tionally accept the draft evaders back  into our society would be to accept a  double standard of justice. It makes no  difference whether one calls it uncondi tional amnesty or unconditional par don-! personally do not see the differen tiation in the term-Mr. Carter's plan to  give these offenders a completely clean  slate is an outrage to our sense of justice.  All of us share the President-elect's  wish to put the war behind us, to heal  the divisiveness and bring unity back to  the country. A blanket pardon for the  remaining 4,000 or so draft evaders, how ever, will neither lessen the bittemess  nor bind the wounds. To placate a hand ful of lawbreakers, Mr. Carter will end  up alienating the millions of men and  women who served honorably and well  and who suffered incredible mental stress  and  physical  disabilities  fulfilling  their duty to the Nation.  Never in the history of our country has  an unconditional amnesty been granted  in  to  those who  evaded  the draft. Mr.  Carter's will be the first of its kind. I  need not spell out the danger that such  an action would create. It is not unlikely  that at some future time, we will have  to once again call upon the young people  of America for their services. Will they  then be willing to risk life and limb in  the interest of their country or will the  majority of them back out and let others  do the fighting, knowing that once it is  all over someone will once again wel come them back ""for the sake of national  unity""?  I agreed with President Ford when he  called upon the American people to join  him in ""rehabilitating all the casualties  of the tragic confiict of the past,"" and I  supported his eamed reentry clemency  program for draft evaders and military  deserters. It was a compassionate gesture  that enable those who had erred and who  wished to retum to do so. Over 21,000  came back under this program. If the  others who were eligible did not do so,  it was of their own choosing.  In my opinion, the opponents of the  Vietnam war had their chance 2 years  ago to once again be a part of the Amer ican scene. Those who refused to accept  President Ford's clemency program will  now have to face up to whatever penalty  the courts may decide. In consideration  of our respected veterans, in the inter ests of justice and national security, and  in fairness  to all  those who had been  willing to pay the price for their beliefs,  I am going on record as being adamantly  opposed to an unconditional pardon for  draft evaders.  ",1977
51,House,95,0.416,929,1,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker,  in the  months ahead the topic of amnesty for  Vietnam-era draft evaders and military  deserters will be heavily debated. It is  imperative that those of us involved at  the decisionmaking  level be aware of  every component of the issue. All too of ten we have heard through the media  a positive analysis while hearing little  of the numerous detrimental effects such  an action would have on our society.  Therefore, I would like to take this op portunity to bring to your attention both  the overt and subtle implications of a  blanket pardon.  Discipline is, and will continue to be,  !fundamental  to  the effectiveness and  morale of our Armed Forces. To issue  amnesty to draft evaders and deserters  would be to invite new violations of mili tary and civil law. If draft age men come  to feel they can flout the law and simply  wait for a future amnesty to exonerate  them conscription in time of need could  prove impossible. Discipline is a prere quisite for a viable military, and any am nesty program would jeopardize it.  Those who calculated to deliberately  evade the law must accept the conse quences. The legal choice of conscientious  objection was open to them and reflected.  Intensive research has revealed that only  ten to twelve percent violated the laws  on moral or religious grounds. To group  together those who left for self-centered  reasons and  those  few who genuinely  faced a moral dilemma is both shallow  and unfair.  Historically, amnesties have only been  ",1977

Craig Smith of Birming ham, Ala., recently received the Free En terprise Award sponsored by the Farm City Committee of Alabama and Ala bama District, Kiwanis International.  His acceptance remarks vividly con trast the advantages of democracy and  free enterprise as observed in West Ber lin and East Berlin.  Because his observations point out so  clearly the value of an open system of  government  in West Berlin,  I  include  Mr. Smith's comments as part of my  remarks at this point:  REMARKS OF J. CRAIG SMrrH  A few days ago,  I  returned from a visit  to West Berlin. While there, I made a one day visit to East Berlin.  'Ilb.e contrast be tween  the  two cities must be seen  to be  believed.  West Berlin, dedicated  to  the principles  of democracy and free enterprise, is bustling  with activity. Its citizens have a standard  of living equal to ours. There  is complete  freedom of speech and of  the press. The  night  life  is glamorous. Their money has  appreciated in value compared to all other  money  in  ,the world,  including ours. The  city is surrounded by one hundred miles of  wall built by  the Communists. No one  in  West Berlin wants to be on the other side  of  the wall. Nearly every day,  some East  German risks fhis or her life in an effort to  escape communism. A  few are successful.  Visitors to East Berlin must pass through  ""Check-Point Charlie.'' No visitor can qring  in a.ny newspaper or other printed matter.  All money must be declared and accounted  for at time of exit. The inhabitants of East  Berlin  seem  listless  and  hopeless. Their  standard of living is low, although the gov ernment heavily  subsidizes both housing  and public transportation.  Luxuries such as tea, coffee, and alcoholic  beverages are priced far beyond the reach of  the average citizen. There are queues of peo ple at most stores and restaurants waiting to  buy scarce goods. No one wants  the East  German money. It is easy to understand why  foreign money has to be accounted for at the  time of leaving. I have never seen automo biles more thoroughly searched than the ones  going back to West Berlin. Mirrors are placed  under the cars to detect any East German  who might be trying to escape. The guards  even probe the gasoline tanks.  I mention  the differences between West  Berlin and East Berlin in some detail because  the contrast is accounted for entirely by their  two systems of government. When the Rus sians  took charge of East Berlin and  the  Americans, British, and French took charge  of west Berlin, there was only one city, with  the same people. Thirty years later, we have  the two situations I have brlefiy described.  Early  in his administration,  I hope that  President-elect Carter and his Secretary of  State w111 find time to visit the two Berlins.  I believe they will conclude, as I did, that  until the wall around West Berlin is removed,  and until the fortified barbed-wire fences  which stretch across the continent of Europe  and which we call the Iron Curtain are torn  down, talk of detente is somewhat ridiculous.  It is impossible for any of us to have any  true appreciation of what we have in this  country resulting from competitive free en terprise and  the  form of government be queathed to us by our forebearers unless a.nd  until we see what other people have around  the world.  I commend each of you for the tremendous  effort you have made and are making to edu cate the American people in respect to the  priceless value of what we have. I have been  trying to think of an award I would rather  receive  than the one you have given me.  Nothing has come to my mind. I am deeply  grateful.  UKRAINIAN  INDEPENDENCE DAY  HON. WILLIAM M. BRODHEAD  OF MZCHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 11, 1977  ",1977
54,,95,-0.463,968,1,Mr. BRODHEAD.," Mr. Speaker,  the  people of the United States feel a close  moral kinship  the people of  the  Ukraine, who continue to maintain their  tO  unique cultural heritage in spite of the  Soviet Union's efforts to suppress their  national character and freedoms. Janu ary 22 marks  the 59th anniversary of  Ukrainian independence, and I wish to  salue  the  indominable  spirit  of  the  Ukrainian people.  The fall of the Russian Czar was the  signal for bursting enthusiasm through out the Ukraine. Despite the systematic  attempts of the Russian Government to  suppress Ukrainian  ideals and aspira tions, the goal of freedom has survived.  Since its formation in March 1917, the  Ukrainian Central Rada, through a series  of important acts, led Ukraine through a  turbulent period, establishing  first an  autonomous state an,d then proclaimed a  full-fledged  independent and sovereign  state of the Ukrainian people.  However, the Ukrainians enjoyed their  long-awaited fredom only briefly. The  invading Russian troops forced the gov ernment into exile and established the  Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic  in  1923  which  immediately  surrendered  Ukrainian independence in favor of the  Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics.  The Ukrainian people in the free world  have since commemorated January 22  as a Ukrainian Independence Day and  used this opportunity to keep the flame  of hope burning  in  the hearts of  the  enslaved Ukrainians who long for their  denied but God-given rights of national,  individual, cultural and religious free dom.  TAX PENALTIES RESULTING FROM  ELIMINATION OF SICK PAY EX CLUSION  HON. MARTHA KEYS  OF KANSAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 11, 1977  ",1977
55,,95,-0.231,968,1,Mrs. KEYS.," Mr. Speaker, the imple mentation of  the Tax Reform Act of  1976 has placed an unexpected burden  upon many Federal retirees and other  taxpayers. Changes made by the Con gress in the treatment of sick and dis ability pay,  foreign  income, and child  care expenses among others has retro actively increased the 1976 tax liability  of many individuals.  The largest group of taxpayers affected  are Federal retirees who previously took  advantage of the $100-a-week sick pay  exclusion. The exclusion of up to $5,200 a  year has now been limited to those under  65 who have retired on a permanent and  total disability. Thus, retirees who ex pected to utilize the sick pay exclusion in  1976 may find they have failed to with hold sufficient funds to cover their new  tax liability. Without remedial legisla tion, those who have failed to withhold  adequate taxes may be subject to the im position of a penalty by the IRS.  The legislation which I am introducing  would assure that no taxpayer is assessed  a penalty as a result of changes in the  tax law.  Section 1 of the bill would allow indi vidual taxpayers until April 15, 1977corporations until March 15, 1977-to  pay their full 1976 income tax liabilities  ",1977
56,,95,0.1,981,1,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, I am rein troducing a bill today that, while costing  little, would remedy a serious defect in  the medicare program. The proposed leg islation would amend title xvn of the  Social Security Act so the medicare bene ficiaries  living or traveling outside the  United States could receive benefits for  hospital care and related physician and  ambulance services received abroad.  Under the existing medicare statute,  hospital care and related physician and  ambulance services furnished abroad are  covered only when provided in Canada  or Mexico, and even then only under very  limited circumstances. First, benefits can  be paid when the beneficiary is hospital ized in those two countries as the result  of an emergency that arose in the United  States. This coverage applies only where  the foreign hospital is either nearer to,  or more accessible than, the nearest suit able U.S. hospital. Social security legis lation enacted in 1972 added two more  exceptions  to the general exclusion of  services rendered abroad. One permits  payment to be made for a U.S. resident  in a border State who lives nearer to a  suitable  foreign hospital  than  to  the  nearest U.S. hospital that is adequately  equipped  to meet his needs. For these  beneficiaries, benefits can be paid with out regard to whether an emergency ex isted or where the illness or injury took  place. The 1972 amendments also provided benefits for U.S. residents who are  forced by a medical emergency  to be  hospitalized in Canada while  traveling  from Alaska to another State.  The  various  provisions  for  paying  medicare benefits abroad are very im portant to the relatively few aged and  disabled U.S. citizens who are involved.  However, they meet only a part of the  problem. For those who lose their medi care eligibility because they do not meet  the narrow limitations of the law, hos pitalization abroad could lead to finan cial ruin.  Of the 30 million people eligible for  medicare benefits in the United States,  authorities estimate that nearly 150,000  would be reenfranchised by my bill-a  relatively small, but important group of  American citizens.  There is ample precedent for contin uing the health insurance protection of  insured persons while  they are absent  from the United States. This is general ly provided for in private health insur ance plans. The Veterans' Administra tion has also demonstrated that health  benefits can be made available abroad.  It provides health services  to veterans  with  service-connected  disabilities  in  countries where there are no U.S. mili tary facilities--as in France.  In light of the seemingly uncontrolla ble budget of Federal health care pro grams, we are all concerned with costs.  Yet, bear in mind that these people have  previously  established  their  right  these services  through  their contribu tions into the medicare system. Further. more, costs of health care in the United  States are higher than in almost every  other country. In any event, limitations  in my bill assure that costs 'fill not exto  ceed what is paid in the United States.  As a result, extension of medicare abroad  will be less costly than if those eligible  were taken care of at home, as they are  entitled to be.  The problems faced by the elderly and  disabled in need of health services while  abroad is probably more a concern to me  and the other Members whose congres sional districts border on Canada and  Mexico. Nevertheless, all my colleagues  are potentially faced with the risk of this  problem  if their elderly and disabled  constituents travel or live abroad. In this  regard, I was pleased to see that Con gressman RosTENKowsxr, Chairman of  the Health Subcommittee of the House  Ways and Means Committee, introduced  comparable legislation late last session  on this subject. His recognition of the  need in this area represents a victory on  the part of those affected.  In summary,  the bill  I am offering  would affect relatively few individuals. It  would, however, protect those individuals  from medical bills that could wipe out a  lifetime of savings and lead to the very  dependency that social security and its  medicare program are intended to pre vent. I urge that the Congress act soon  to close this gap in medicare protection.  A TRIBUTE TO JOE McCAFFREY  HON. LIONEL VAN DEERLIN  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 11, 1977  Mr. VAN DEERLIN. Mr. Speaker, one  of the benefits of my years in Congress  has been my close association with Joe  ",1977
57,,95,-0.464,994,1,Mr. KOCH.," Mr. Speaker, a major is sue of consideration for the 95th Con gress should be that of welfare reform.  The President-elect, Members of Con gress, and the citizenry as a whole, recog nize the grave consequences for our Na tion  of  an  expensive  and  unwieldy  welfare program. For the past 6 months  I have been working on a comprehensive  welfare reform proposal, the Minimum  Income Maintenance Act. I would like  to share a summary of that bill with my  colleagues.  My proposed legislation would reform  current welfare programs and consoli date AFDC, SSI, and food stamp pro grams into a single Federal welfare pro gram which is both equitable and effi cient. It includes work incentives and a  -uniform Federal welfare payment ad justed  for  cost-of-living  differences  across the country.  Obviously, there will be a great many  proposed solutions to our national wel fare dilemma, and my legislation cer tainly does not address all the problem  areas. I do hope, however, that it can  serve as a vehicle for much needed dis cussion and I welcome comments on its  contents.  A summary of the bill follows:  SUMMARY OF TH'E MINIMUM INCOME MAINTE NANCE AcT (MIMA) H.R. 952  The Minlmum  Income Maintenance Act  would replace the AFDC, SSI and Food Stamp  programs with a single national welfare sys tem of benefits which would be adm1n1stered  by the federal government and for which all  qualified residents of the U.S. would be ell gible. The legislation would regionalize wel fare benefits by utilizing the Bureau of Labor  Statistics' (BLS)  ""lower budget"" figure  for  both SMSA (Standard Metropolitan Statisti cal Area) and non-SMSA areas. In determin ing maintenance payments,  the bill would  establish the applicable BLS figure as the el1gibil1ty standards and 50% of the applicable  BLS figure as the maximum Koch payment.  The Koch benefit would be that maximUlll  figure reduced by one-half of all income and  work enabling expenses, as defined by the  Act.  A sample of current BLS lower budget fig ures for a family of four is set forth below  to convey an idea of what the level of bene fits would be in the different regions across  the country.  New York City, $10,266.  Pittsburgh, Pa., $9,205.  Cleveland, Ohio, $9,489.  Detroit, Mich., $9,501  (Maximum payment  would be 50% of this figure).  Atlanta, Ga. $8,924.  Baton Rouge, La., $8,588.  Denver, Co., $9,319.  San Francisco, Ca., $10,509--.  Note: Currently, BLS provides lower budget  figures for a hypothetical family of four and  for a retired couple in 40 of the 276 SMSAs.  The BLS hypothetical family of four con sists of a 38 year old husband employed full  time, his non-working wife, a boy of 13 and  a girl of 8. The Koch program would have  BLS develop comparable figures for varying  famlly sizes and compositions in SMSA and  non-SMSA areas.  For purposes of the b111, income is defined  as including both earned and unearned in come and all public payments, suQh as vet erans' benefits and social security, in order to  reduce the inequities created by some state  welfare programs which reduce benefits by  some government payments but not by oth ers. The Secretary of HEW would determine  which inkind and vendor payments would be  exempted in computing income. Medicaid is  to be the only public payment explicitly ex empted for that purpose. Work enabling ex penses, as defined by regulations promul gated by the Secretary (including day-care  expenses) would be deductible in establish ing ""income.""  The definitions and formulas which fol low indicate how the Koch benefit would be  computed.  Eligib1l1 ty  Standard-The  BLS  budget  figure for respective family size and SMSA,  or comparable non-SMSA figure.  Maximum  Payment--50%  of  plicable BLS lower budget.  Koch Benefit equals maximum payment  minus:  earned and unearned  income plus  public  payments minus  work  enabling  expenses divided by 2.  Total Family Income equals earned and  unearned income plus public payments plus  Koch benefit.  A slgnifl.cant aspect of the Koch formula  1s the way in which it deals with the prob lem of work disincentive-a well-known fall ing of our current welfare systems. Under  the Koch blil, benefits decrease as the recip ient's income increases by a benefit loss rate  of 50% until the ceiling  is reached. Thus  program benefits are  tapered off gradually  until the benefit levels have been diminished  to an insignifl.cant amount before applying  the cutoff. By doing so,  the system avoids  work disincentives created by an abrupt,  though perhaps lower, cutoff point. Similarly,  work  enabling  expenses  such  as day-care  costs are deducted from the income level in  calculating benefits so as to avoid penal1z1ng  the recipient for having  incurred  the un avoidable costs of pursuing gainful  em ployment.  Mandatory  registration at  local employ ment offices and active  job seeking are a  prerequisite to receiving benefits under the  Koch b111. The elderly, the hand1capped and  mothers with pre-school children would be  exempt !rom that requirement.  Below are computations which show how  the Koch benefit formula would create a ra tional work incentive scale.

Chlldless couples,  intact  familles,  individ uals, retired couples, dependent children and  step-parents (as they contribute to the sup port of dependents) are defined and included  in the program.  Quarterly  retrospective  accounting  and  monthly reporting would be employed in ad ministering the program. Though states that  wish to participate in the program will be  specifl.cally prohibited  from supplementing  the Koch benefit, emergency needs will be  covered by regulations promulgated by the  Secretary. Assets shall be imputed to income  by disregarding the first $10,000 of assets and  counting each additional $10,000 of assets as  $100 in income.  The Minimum  Income Maintenance Act  contains a  ""grandfather clause""  to  insure  that those families currently receiving AFDC,  SSI and Food Stamps do not suffer immedi ate losses because of the transfer to a na tional welfare program. Those families  for  whom benefits under the Koch blll would be  less than those which they currently receive  from the programs listed above, would con tinue receiving  their current  level of pay ment for two years. Anyone who files an ap plication for public assistance after the bill  is enacted would not be entitled to the level  of payment  insured by  the bill's ""grand father clause.""  The Inspector General of HEW would be  specifically empowered  to  investigate and,  where necessary, prosecute cases of both ad ministrative and recipient fraud.  In addi tion, the Inspector General will be empow ered to audit the program for over and under  payments.  The total cost of this program would be  $35-40 billion according  to estimates pro vided by the House of Representatives In formation System. This contrasts to the cur rent total cost of $23 billion which includes  the  federal,  state  and  local  government  shares of AFDC, SSI, Food Stamp and gen eral aid. Currently cities, counties and states  are carrying over 40% of our total welfare  costs.  TO PROTECT THE OCEANS  HON. G.

59,Senate,95,-0.124,1020,1,Mr. JAVITS.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased to join today with Senator HART  introducing the Federal Sentencing  Standards Act of 1977. In my judgment  it represents a very important challenge  to an unworkable and essentially unjust  sentencing system which has contributed  significantly to the extraordinary diffi culties which have plagued our criminal  Jqstice system in recent decades in the  United States.  That  larger  system-beset with  so  many ills and bombarded with so much  criticism is in little better shape today  after  the  investment of $5  billion  in  Federal funds  through the LEAA pro gram than before the Safe Streets Act  was passed in 1968.  Serious crime statistics are still rising.  The number of offenders incarcerated in  U.S. prisons  is also  rising-250,000 at  the end of 1975, with a million or more  on probation or parole,  and another  quarter million  in  jails and detention  facilities.  Despite the fact that many of its prob lems are acute-problems of funding, of  resource allocation, of administration,  of the overwhelming numbers jamming  the system, the public has most frequent ly judged the competency and fairness  of the system by the way that it sen tences offenders. With good reason it has  frequently  reacted  with  frustration  confusion, and outrage at the wide dis~  parity in the sentences imposed for simi lar crimes and the total absence of any  prescribed guidelines to govern the sen tencing practices of judges.  In 1972, for example, a study prepared  by the distinguished former U.S. attorney  for the southern district of New York  Whitney North Seymour, found wide dis~  parity  in  that court's sentencing  for  specific crimes as compared to likelihood  and  length of prison sentence  in all  all other Federal courts. The study which  is  summarized  in  the  table  following  shows the disparity that exists both in  white collar and violent offenses:  Likelihood of  imprisonment  (percent)  Average length  of prison sentences (months)  Southern  All  Southern  District of Federal District of  New York  courts New York  All  Federal  courts  66.7  23.2  82.8  25.0  51.7  41.6  37.2  50.0  50.0  35.4  54.8  77.0  50.0  44.3  43.7  46.3  55.5  70.4  66.7  100.0  63.3  66.2  19.5  91.8  42.5  53.7  42.8  29.9  45.3  42.8  36.5  43.7  70.6  53.0  40.7  19.0  47.3  47.1  55.4  21.5  57.4  27.8  10.0  25.6  18.0  21.3  69.6  124.1  11.0  15.1  14.8  40.3  16.8  32.0  3.3  14.5  28.2  32.1  2. 5  6.4  5. 9  10.4  18.1  33.8  62.4  46.4  5.2  28.0  18.8  32.5  5.0  11.6  20.1  50.5  46.2  31.2  31.8  38.7  20.5 -------36.5  38.7  12.4  22.2  54.1  43.8  35.2  38.1  Offenses  Bail jumping _________  lilank embezzlement___  Bank robbery ________  Bribery ______________  Counterfeiting ________  Forgery ______________  Gambling ____________  Guns ________________  Immigration __________  IRS ____ ------------Interstate ____________  Narcotics ___ --------Perjury ______________  PostaL _____________  Embezzlement__ __  Other_ __________  Rackets and extortion_  Securities ____________  Fraud_-------___  Theft ____________  Selective Service ______  TotaL ________  Note: The figures for the Southern District of New York are  bas.ed on sentences  imposed  in a 6-mo period  in 1972. The  natrona! figures cover the fiscal year ending June 30, 1972.  I would not suggest that the fault is  that of the many dedicated and hard  ~orking members of the Federal judi ciary; for the Congress, the courts, and  the legal profession have never developed  a comprehensive approach to the prob lem of sentencing reform.  The bill Senator HART and I are in troducing today attempts to achieve that  very objective and is  the outgrowth of  the work of a distinguished panel of ex perts-the Committee for the Study of  Incarceration-headed  by my  distin guished  former  colleague  from New  York, Charles E. Goodell. The executive  director of the committee and principal  author of  its  report:  ""Doing Justice:  The Choice of Punishment,"" was Rutgers  University Prof. Andrew von Hirsch who  consulted with our staffs in the drafting  of the bill.  The four major parts of the bill do  in  our judgment, constitute the begin.n'ing  of a Federal sentencing system which  could help with respect to public con fidence in our criminal justice process :  First, it would narrow the discretion  ~hich can be exercised by sentencing  Judges by employing  the ""presumptive  sentence"" device. For each gradation of  seriousness of criminal behavior a defi nite  penalty-the  ""presumpti;e  sen tence""-would be set. Individuals con victed of crimes of that degree of serious ness  would  ordinarily  receive  the  presumptive sentence, unless they were  special, carefully defined circumstances  of aggravation or mitigation.  Second, the presumptive sentence and  the permitted. aggravating and mitigat ing circumstances would be prescribed by  a Federal Sentencing Commission. The  Commission's guidelines would take ef feet within  30  legislative  days  after  promulgation,  unless both Houses  of  Congress adopted a resolution of disap proval. The Federal Sentencing Com mission would have an initial life of 5  years.  Third, the bill sets forth the rationale  which the Commission must follow  in  prescribing its sentences; namely, a ""just  deserts"" rationale. The severity of sen tences would have to be based on the  seriousness of  the  individual's offense,  rather than on his likelihood of recidi vism or need for treatment. Imprison ment, as a severe penalty, would be re stricted to serious crimes. For lesser of fenses, penalties other than  imprison ment will be prescribed, such as fines,  community  service,  and  intermittent  confinement.  Finally, since the sentence will be based  on the seriousness of the offense  inde terminancy of sentence will be phased  out. By insuring that the offender serves  the sentence determined by the sentenc ing judge, the public and the prisoner are  both assured of both the certainty of  punishment and the date of its comple tion.  Mr. President,  I wish also  to com mend the work done on this subject by  two of our distinguished colleagues Sen ator KENNEDY and Senator BENTSEN.  I  look forward  to working with them to  develop the most effective legislation pos sible. I wish also to call the Senate's at tention to the views of an able lawyer  and my longtime friend Robert B. Mc Kay,  formerly dean of  the New Xork  University School of Law and now the  director of  the Aspen  Institute's Pro gram on Justice, Society, and the Indi vidual.  I ask unanimousconsent that his arti cle, entitled, ""It's Time To Rehabilitate  the Sentencing Process,"" Judicature, De cember 1976, be printed in the RECORD  at the end of my remarks. In this article  Dean McKay discusses many of the ques tions relevant to any presumptive sen tencing system.  Mr. President, the sentencing system  demonstrated every day in U.S. courts  is characterized by gross disparities and  often is totally lacking in overall ration ale  and  fundamental  fairness. Equal  treatment should be the rule and it is  not. These disparities have  threatened  the credibility of our judicial system. The  entire criminal justice process is under mined when significant numbers of of fenders  randomly  escape punishment  while others convicted of similar ac~  are handled discriminatorily. Congress  must act to right this imbalance by en acting our legislation promptly.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  IT'S TIME To REHABILITATE THE SENTENCING  PROCESS  (By Robert McKay)  The criminal justice system in the United  States is a. failure. It is in disarray a.t every  level. It neither controls crime nor punishes  criminals.

60,House,95,-0.139,1046,1,Mr. WHALEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I wish  to congratulate the National Bureau of  Standards on the excellent report they  released  this morning, entitled, ""Com puters, Health Records,  and Citizen  Rights.""  This report was authored by Colum bia University Prof. Alan F. Westin, one  of the Nation's foremost experts on the  subject of rights of privacy. The NBS  report provides what appears to be the  most  indepth analysis  to. date of  the  problem of managing data systems  in  the health field so that citizens' privacy  rights are adequately protected.  We all know that medical records con~  tain absolutely the most sensitive, per sonal information about us. Now, there  is increasing concern over the confiden tiality of those records.  Traditionally, personal medical records  could be obtained only by going to the  individual's personal physician or  by  checking  hospital  records,  and most  people felt secure in relying upon tradi tional concepts of doctor-patient priv~  ileged communications  to protect  the  confidentiality of those records.  But now medical practice is becoming  more  institutionalized. Primary health  care  is coming more and more  from  clinics or via health care plans. And  hospitals are increasingly called upon to  deliver certain kinds of primary health  care that previously have been delivered  by private practitioners. So,  there  is  perhaps a  less secure feeling on the pa tient's part, because he or she does not  have a  personal  relationship with  the  physician.  More ominous,  though,  the vast  growth  in  the amount and variety of  medical data that flow to third parties insurance companies, employers, investi gators, researchers, etcetera. The use of  computerized data storage and retrieval  makes medical records far easier to ac cumulate, store, and use. This, I believe,  is what really troubles most N:nericans  is  when they contemplate the security of  their medical records.  Professor Westin's report probes this  problem and many other important is.:.  sues in the medical record privacy area.  Related to the third-party access prob lem is the common practice of insurance  companies and others routinely requir ing  individuals  to  sign  forms  giving  open-ended consent for an examination  of all available personal medical infor mation. Westin analogizes this kind of  blanket release form, which is generally  obtained under implied coersion, to the  sort of general search warrant that the  British Government used  during our  colonial period. The fourth amendment  now prohibits the use of such warrants  by Government authorities.  I believe that the issue of confidential ity of medical records is one that touches  every American and should be of inter est and concern to all Members of Con gress. Consequently, Mr. Speaker, I have  arranged  for  Professor Westin  and  others associated with the National Bu reau of Standards study to come to the  Hill sometime early in the week of Janu ary 24 to conduct a briefing for Members  and staff. The details now are being  worked out and I will announce them as  soon as possible.  In the meantime, I want to insert at  this point in the RECORD  the ""Code of  Citizen-Rights Practices for Health Data  Systems"" and the ""Twelve Basic Princi ples for Safeguarding Privacy of Health  Data Systems."" Both are extracted from  the NBS  report,  ""Computers, Health  Records, and Citizen Rights,"" which was  released today:  CODE OF CITIZEN-RIGHTS PRACTICES  HEALTH DATA SYSTEMS*  FOR  1. Health data systems should be created,  significantly altered, and periodically audited  through public  rather  than closed proce dures.  Health data systems should be created by  public notice and privacy-impact procedures,  communicated to any population of known  individuals about whom records are to be  kept, and reviewed by an independent au thority. Major expansions, and tests of the  system's adherence to rules, should also be  reviewed periodically by outside authority.  2. Every health data system should observe  lilnits of relevance and social propriety in  what personal and medical  information it  collects or records.  Such limits will depend not only on what  each data system really needs to carry out a  mission approved by society but also on how  effectively, by law and practice, an organi zation  handles  the  particularly  sensitive  health information it seeks to record.  3. Every health data system should pro mulgate clear rules and procedures that in sure citizen rights.  These include advance notice to individu als of the uses that will be made of their  personal information; a right to obtain full  information  about  the  contents of  their  health records and to inspect such records if  they desire;  information-release forms that  specify what is to be released, to whom, and  for what period of time; and patient's rights  handbooks and representatives for all health care facilities.  4. Health data system managers should  *This code incorporates the twelve prin ciples contained in the final chapter of Com puters, Health Records, and Citizen Rights,  published by the National Bureau of ,Stand ards,  take special measures to protect the accuracy  and security of the data they keep.  Personal data  should be kept accurate,  timely, and complete, measured by the kinds  of uses  that are being made of  it. Staffs  should be trained in citizen rights principles  and procedures, and data security measures  should be taken in accordance with the his tory of data threats 1n that organization's  experience.  5. Managers should follow special proce dures to allow medical research, health-care  evaluation, and public oversight without im pairing citizen rights.  Such procedures include using records in  statistical or coded forms for most review or  research purposes, having protective commit tees screen requests for access to data when  informed consent of the individual cannot  be obtained, and using random audit rather  than  individualized  review  procedures  in  order to avoid invading privacy rights.  [From  Computers, Health  Citizen  Rights-National  Standards]  Records,  Bureau  and  of  TWELVE BASIC PRINCIPLES  FOR  PRIVACY OF HEALTH DATA  SAFEGUARDING  SYSTEMS  3.  (Directed by Alan F. Westin)  The report recommends 12 major principles  for the management of data systems in the  hea.lth field, and discusses alternative ways  that these principles might be carried out.  The 12 principles are:  1. There should be a procedure for issuing  a  public notice and privacy-impact state ment whenever an automated data system is  created in the health field, filed with an ap propriate outside authority and communi cated  to any continuing population of  in dividuals whose records will be affected.  2. Socially-acceptable  standards of  rele vance and propriety in the collection of per sonal data should be worked out for data  systems in each of the three zones of health data use, through public discussion and ap propriate policy-setting mechanisms.  Individuals should be given a clearly written account of how their personal infor ms. tion will be used whenever they are asked  to supply personal information to a health  data system, along with the procedures to  be followed before any uses are made of their  data other than those originally specified.  4. Forms used  to release personal  infor mation from a health data system should be  for a specific purpose, describe the informa tion to be released, and should be lilnlted  in time, and the Individual's consent to such  releases should be informed as well as volun tary.  5. As  a  general matter, patients should  have a right to full information about their  health conditions. Where health data is  to  be used  to make  judgments about service  payment and claims, or in any non-medical  social and governmental programs,  the  in dividual should have an absolute right  inspect what is to be released from hlsjher  record. In chronic and acute care, patients  should also have a right to see any part of  the medical  record,  Including  the medical  professional's working notes, if the patient  insists upon this after the medical profes sional has had a chance to explain directly  to the patient why he or she feels that such  disclosure would not be in the patient's best  medical interest. A special procedure is sug gested  for patient-access problems  in psy chiatric care.  6. Managers of health data systems must  take steps to see  that the personal records  they store are as accurate, timely, and com plete as the uses to be made of them require,  not only  to assure  the  individual's proper  health care but also to protect the individ ual's rights.  7. Data security measures must be taken  to control access according  the policies  set by law ""or by management policies, and  the adequacy of those measures will be measto  to  ",1977
61,,95,-0.299,1059,1,Mr. MINISH.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise to  bring to the attention of my colleagues  legislation (H.R. 1683) I introduced yes terday to provide an ongoing loan pro gram for priority areas such as housing,  public works construction, small and me dium size businesses, and other job cre ating projects.  My bill would create a National De velopment Bank, patterned after  the  New Deal Reconstruction Finance Cor poration. The bank, financed initially by  a $2 billion Federal government pur chase of its stock, would provide a :tlex ible  tool  to stimulate the economy. It  would be authorized to make direct and  guaranteed loans to State and local gov ernments for public works and facilities.  Individuals and corporations unable to  secure credit in the marketplace could  also apply to the bank for ""job .creating""  loans.  The bank would be similar to the Re construction Finance Corporation, which  helped the country out of the Depression  of the 1930's. It should be noted that the  RFC was one of the few Government  agencies of this type to close its books  in the black.  The  National  Development  Bank  would provide a  :tlexible tool to assure  that credit be allocated to areas of great est need. It would also be charged with  ",1977
62,House,95,0.021,1085,1,Mr. MOTTL.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to  join with the gentleman from New York  <Mr. CoNABLE)  in expressing my distress  over the grant announcements made by  the Economic Development Administra tion under the Public Works Employment  Act of 1976.  Title I of the Public Works Employ ment Act was clearly intended to pro vide assistance to State and local gov ernments in alleviating high unemploy ment. Yet, the areas of highest unem ployment in the State of Ohio, and the  most populous  areas,  received only a  small fraction of the grants announced  by the EDA. The Northeast Ohio Area wide Coordinating Agency and numerous  public officials have publicly protested  the pattern of distribution of these funds.  Forty-eight Members of Congress, in cluding myself, have requested an im mediate investigation of the entire proc ess of allocating  these  funds by  the  Comptroller General. I feel it would ap propriate to fully review the present pro gram before plunging ahead with an ex tension of the Public Works Employment  Act.  ",1977
63,House,95,0.097,1085,1,Mr. MITCHELL of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, I welcome  the opportunity to  participate in this special order because  I share your interest in the important  subject under discussion. I have devoted  a considerable amount of time to a study  of this matter and have put together a  special report which I am making avail able  to local government officials  the  media and other interested parties in an  effort to bring the people I represent up  to date on developments.  PUBLIC WORKS  EMPLOYMENT  FUNDING UNDER TITLE  I, A  BY REPRESENTATIVE DONALD  ACT  OF  1976;  SPECIAL REPORT  J. MITCHELL  The widespread dissatisfaction with  the designation of projects for funding  under title I of the Public Works Em ployment Act of 1976 prompts this special  report. I thought you might want a status  report on where we are and where we  are likely to be going with this program  as it relates to our area.  Here is the situation as I see it.  A majority of Congressmen are un happy. As soon as  the December 23d  Federal Register containing  the Eco nomic  Development  Administration's  list of ""proposed projects selected for  funding"" was published there was what  could best be described as a national  uproar.  Colleagues from across the countrY senior members and freshmen, Repub lican and Democrat alike-joined me  in complaining about  the unfair and  inequitable distribution of  funds. The  National League of Cities put out a  strong statement of disapproval. Mayors  from cities of high unemployment,  in cluding  Jersey  City,  11.04  percent;  Miami, 12.1 percent; San Juan, 13.9 per cent;  Sacramento,  10.3  percent  and  Pittsburgh, 9.1 percent, protested and  with good reason. They got nothing.  Closer to home, our fate was similar.  Not a penny of the millions reserved for  areas with an unemployment rate above  .the national average was approved for  the depressed Mohawk Valley area.1 Our  neighbors to the east and west, Albany  and Syracuse, also drew a blank. They  got nothing.  Under provisions of the act reserving  funds for areas with an unemployment  rate between 6.5 percent and the national  average, we came out in better shape.  F<?u~ separate projects totaling nearly $2  nnlllon were approved for a new Her kimer County Jail, an addition to the  Otsego County Jail, a new fire hall for  the town of Dukanesburg in Schenectady  County and an addition to the Worcester  Central School in Otsego County.  But of the 70 percent of the act's allo cation .for areas with an unemployment  rate .higher than the national average,  we did not get one project.1  A lot of questions are being asked in an  effort to determine ~he ""why?"" After all  the legislation was designed to pump dol~  lars for worthy public works projects into  areas of high unemployment-like ours to create  jobs  immediately. How could  there be so many voids all across  the  country?  In Rome, Utica and Johns t~wn-Gloversville? In Jersey City and  Pittsburgh? Even in the President's home  town, Grand Rapids, Mich.? All with un employment  rates above  the national  average.  My  immediate  reaction on Decem ber 23d was to call for a halt to the fur ther processing of all applications until  we ~ould get some answers. I took several  actiOns on that date. A telegram was dis patched-after repeated telephone calls  got a busy signal-to Assistant Secretary  of Coffi!Derce John Eden requesting the  processmg halt pending the completion  of an  immediate  investigation by  the  ~ol!-Se. a:nd Senate committees having  ~u~dictiOn over the program's author IZatiOn. I asked for that investigation in  telegrams sent to the chairmen of the  committees.  .  I then contacted the General Account Ing Office, the investigative arm of Con gress, to request an independent audit of  the. procedures used by EDA  to select  proJects for funding.  The next day I sent a letter to every  ~e?tber of ~he House and Senate out lmmg my diSSatisfaction with the pro gram, reporting on the steps I had taken  and enlisting additional support for the  cause. I received a number of favorable  responses and quickly learned the dis satisfaction was widespread, prompting  many ?f my c~lleagues to respond exactly  as I did-callmg for a halt in the pro gram pending an investigation.  Additionally I called the White House  to register my complaints. I talked with  1 Little Falls project not in original an nouncement. Our  investigation uncovered  error in EDA computation. EDA has acknowl edged error and is taking corrective action.  ",1977
64,,95,-0.123,1111,1,Mr. BREAUX.," Mr. Speaker, the long  and outstanding career of one of the  leading members of the Louisiana ju diciary has come to a close with the re tirement of Third Circuit Court of Ap peals Judge Minos D. Miller, Jr.  The honorable judge began his service  in 1953 as the sole 31st judicial district  judge, a post he held for 15 years and  held well, having been cited by the Ju dicial Administrator of Louisiana  for  maintaining a current docket with no  backlog of cases.  In 1968 he was elected to the appelate  court and has served many times on the  State supreme court by special appoint ment. Judge Miller has also chaired or  served on numerous special committees  appointed by the supreme court dealing  with the administration of justice, a vital  concern to us all.  It is a record you would expect from a  man so willing to serve his country. Mil ler served in the U.S. Navy for 4'!2 years  and was awarded the Purple Heart when  his plane was shot down over the island  1111  of Formosa. A combat pilot on the USS  Wasp, he was captured by the Japanese  and held until the end of World War II  as an unregistered prisoner in various  Japanese prison camps. At the end of  hostilities he was found in a prison camp  in Omori, Japan and returned  to the  United States for rehabilitation, where  he was personally greeted by President  Harry Truman.  His life back in the States since that  time has been equally impressive. Judge  Millers' untiring  activities  in church,  charitable, and civic organizations over  the last 30 years are too numerous to de tail here, but those of us who have been  privileged to work with him-or merit  his friendship-have reaped professional  and personal rewards from his counsel,  his wisdom, his work and his goodness.  I am glad to have had that opportunity and know that the man will be sorely  missed.  JAMES A. PAVLICEK, SYMBOLIC  OF SCOUTING  HON. JOSEPH M. GAYDOS  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 13, 1977  Mr.  ",1977
65,,95,-0.278,1111,1,Mr. GAYDOS.,"  Speaker,  the  achievement of Eagle Scout in the Boy  Scouts of America is an honor shared by  relatively few Americans. It is an award  which requires considerable time, effort  and talent on the part of the Scout and a  great deal of sacrifice and dedication on  the part of those who advise him.  Consequently, when a young American  attains this honor, I feel privileged to call  it to the attention of my colleagues in  the Congress of  the United States. In  this particular instance, I am speaking  about a young man from North Braddock,  Pa., James A. Pavlicek.  Jim is an active member of Troop 344  at St. Helen's Roman Catholic Church  in east Pittsburgh, and his attainment  of the Eagle Scout rank tops a long list  of accomplishments: Holder of various  offices in the troop, 26 merit badges, 11  skill awards, 2 historical  trail awards,  and the Ad Altari Dei Medal. He also  holds membership in the Braddock Gen eral Hospital Explorer Post  and  the  Brotherhood of the Order of Arrow.  Jim now is working to attain certifica tion as a  junior scoutmaster as well as  striving for the Pope Pius religious em blem and an Eagle palm.  Quite frankly, I believe Jim Pavlicek  could serve as an example of what the  Boy Scouts of America represents. One  of  six children, he  is a hard working  youth who contributes  the family's  financial responsibilities by holding down  three paper routes and a part-time job  at a local restaurant.  According to his scoutmaster, Mr. Jo seph F. Venturella, Jim is an excellent  student at St. Thomas' IDgh School in  Braddock. His interest in photography  has led to his serving as the official pho tographer for Troop 344. And, following  graduation, Jim has his eyes set for a  career in medicine.  to  ",1977
66,,95,-0.564,1124,1,Mr. RICHMOND.," Mr. Speaker, on Jan uary  4,  1977,  I  introduced  the Mid dle-Aged and Older Worker Employment  Act of 1977 as a means of easing the  unemployment  crisis  and  stimulating  greater opportunities for the worker over  the age of 40.  The  legislation which  I  have  intro duced would establish a midcareer de velopment  service within  the Depart ment of Labor through which the Secre tary would be authorized to make train ing loans and grants for programs to im prove the skills and abilities of older and  middle-aged workers, and would provide  recruitment, placement, and counseling  services in the case of a mass layoff in a  given area. The bill provides for research  to improve and stimulate opportunities  for middle-aged people, and enables the  President to appoint a Commission on  Lifelong Adult Education.  All  the elements of  the bill are  in tended to alleviate  the stages of crisis  that  the  employed person  encounters  once he reaches the age of 40, and to  keep the person over 40 as a productive  member of society.  According to several key studies con ducted over the past several years, when  an employed individual reaches his 40's  or 50's he begins to face some very seri ous  di:fficulties-""joblessness  begins  to  rise, duration of unemployment inc.reases  sharply, occupational mobility  is seri ously limited, and the incidence of pov erty increases.""  From August 1969 to November 1976,  the number of  unemployed  increased  from 2,856,000 to 7,769,000, representing  a  percentage  increase of 272 percent.  While the increased unemployment was  difficult for  the entire Nation,  the in crease had very serious consequences for  that group of workers over the age of 40.  In August of 1969, there were 596,000  unemployed Americans over the age of  40. Today there are 1.4 million Americans  over that age out of work. According to  Department of Labor statistics, this rep resents 26.7 percent of the total unem ployed. While  the national unemploy ment rate as of November was 7.8 per cent, it is fast approaching 9 percent for  individuals  between  the  ages  of  55  and 64.  According to a report by the National  Council on Senior Citizens,  the above  figures only represent the ""tip of the ice berg."" Because of the limited possibilities  for employment, it was estimated in 1972  that more than 2.5 million older men had  ""withdrawn"" from the labor force. As suming that just 25 percent of these in dividuals wanted and needed employ ment, then 600,000 people would have to  be added to the number of unemployed.  The figures are even worse for women.  The NCSC study noted that in 1972, 11.6  million older women were out of  the  labor force. If just 5 percent of these  women wanted and needed employment,  then another 600,000 people would have  to be added to the unemployment figures.  The conclusion by the NCSC was that if  the present trend continues,  in a  few  years 1 out of 6 men between the ages of  55 and 59 will no longer be in the labor  force.  One of  the major problems  facing  older workers who have been laid off and  seeking employment is the duration of  unemployment.  The Senate Special Committee on Ag ing reported that older workers can ex pect to be unemployed 30 to 70 percent  longer than other groups. Currently, 1  out of 3 has been unemployed  longer  than 15 weeks, 39 percent are in the cate gory  long-term unemployment or un employed longer than 27 weeks, and 40  percent are in the category of very long term unemployment or unemployed for  longer than 6 months.  These figures become more significant  when one takes into consideration that,  though,  in some States, such as New  York, it is possible to collect unemploy ment benefits for as long as 65 weeks,  the average duration of unemployment  benefits is 20 to 25 weeks.  The options once unemployment com pensation is exhausted are limited. For  many the only recourse is welfare. For  others, if they are at the Social Security  ages, 62 or 65, it is possible to begin col lecting social security benefits. However,  many of those who begin receiving social  security benefits hope to find some in come to supplement the benefits, but not  so much income that it would decrease  the benefits.  For  those below  social security age  there is a possibility of taking part-time  employment but very often  it  is with  drastic reductions in pay and require ments  in  skill. For  these  individuals,  aside from the di1Iiculty in paying mort gages and supporting families, long-term  unemployment may possibly have  the  damaging effect of reducing future re tirement  income.  The saddest element of all the figures  concerning older people is the increas ing  level of poverty. According  to the  Bureau of Census, there are 25,877,000  people now  living  in poverty. Of that  figure 5,450,000 represent heads of houSe holds. Of these 5 million family heads,  well over 1 million are between the ages  of 45 and 64, 'and 728,000 are over tbe  age of 65.  One of the problems of older employ ment legislation is convincing people tha~  older people want and need to work. The  1 million heads of household are obvious  evidence of the need. It can certainly be  assumed that a good percentage of them  are able and willing to work. Though, the  Age Discrimination Act was a positive  step, it is not positive enough. Though,  title IX, community service jobs are an  ",1977
67,Senate,95,0.322,1150,1,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President, I want to  take  this opportunity  today to restate  my continued strong objections to issu ance of a blanket Presidential pardon  for draft evaders, military deserters, or  those with  less  than honorable  dis charges. It would be a serious mistake  for any of us to underestimate the nega tive impact which such a pardon would  have on our country's future defense ca pabilities, as well as on the concept of  equal justice for all in this Nation.  The President-elect has already indi cated that he intends to issue a blanket  pardon for all Vietnam-era draft resis ters within 1 week  following his  in auguration. There have been indications  that the pardon will be extended to mili tary deserters and violaters of military  law as well. My colleague from the State  of Alabama has  introduced a Senate  resolution urging that no such general  amnesty be issued by the new President,  and I fully support the purpose of this  measure.  A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT  It seems entirely clear that a sweeping  pardon for those who willingly violated  our selective service laws undermines the  very sense of an individual's legal and  moral responsibility, which bolsters our  national defense system. We are not en gaging in an academic debate about the  morality of the Vietnam war. We are dis cussing the executive-level sanctioning of  willful violations of conscription  laws.  Hundreds of  thosuands obeyed  those  laws,  providing  the military  resource  upon which our Nation has traditionally  relied. A serious crisis  to our national  security in the future would require the  same sort of reliance. I shudder to think  of a situation where each man of mili tary age would decide,  in a  cavalier  manner, whether to obey or disregard the  draft law. But a blanket pardon at this  time would encourage that behavior, I  believe.  Each of those who consciously evaded  this responsibllity 1n the last war did so  for his own very personal reasons. I do  not doubt for a moment that some of  those  reasons were well-founded and  justified. Those who felt motivated by a  legitimate cause should not hesitate to  ask that it be considered on its own mer its. I am not opposed to a compassionate  review of such circumstances on a case by-case basis. But a democracy such as  ours is based on obedience to the law,  and disobedience  should not be con doned on a blanket basis. If it is, then  the strength of our Nation's security will  be reduced by chaos and confusion.  AN OFFENSE TO THOSE WHO SERVED  Advocates of blanket amnesty or par don talk of national reconciliation, com passion, and justice. What about equal  justice under the law? What about jus tice and compassion for those who an swered their Nation's call; for those who  returned disabled by war; and for the  families of  those killed  in action and  those still missing? I personally find it  very  difficult  to  characterize  draft  evaders or military deserters as ""moral  heroes"" who were ""victimized"" by cir cumstances, when they have shown no  inclination to make an alternative con tribution to their country. Certainly, the  men and women who performed their  legal and political duties when called  upon contributed an  integral part of  themselves to the welfare of this Nation.  The attitude which I and many of my  colleagues in Congress share on this is sue is not one of vindictiveness, but rep resents a commitment to equal treatment  for all. This attitude, I believe, is shared  by many Americans today.  I was deeply impressed by news reports  last week of the former Vietnam prisoner  of war, Lt. Comdr. Michael D. Christian,  who announced his retirement from the  Navy  to protest blanket amnesty  for  draft evaders. He was quoted as saying  that:  Over the years, we have brainwashed our selves  into being bad guys. Now we make  heroes out of deserters and condemn our selves. The price of honor seems pretty cheap  this year.  Commander Christian, who has been  awarded more than 10 medals of com mendation, announced  that he would  leave his medals on the graves of Viet nam veterans to furt]ler dramatize his  concern. I, for one, respect his decision  and know that his concerns are the con cerns of many Americans.  BLANKET PARDON D..L-ADVISED  It is appalling to think that a blanket  pardon will be one of the first official aots  of the new administration. I am particu larly concerned that priority attention is  being given to that matter when we still  do not possess all available information  about the fates of our MIA's in Indo china. The final  report  issued by  the  House Select Committee  on Missing  Servicemen last month concluded, on the  basis of their studies, that the Vietnam ese do possess additional  information  about MIA's that has never been turned  over to our Government. I believe that  tliis is the matter which deserves priority  attention, and I have introduced legisla tion calling for early creation of a Presi dential task force to obtain such addi tional information.  Although the wisdom and morality of  the Vietnam war is still disputed in some  circles, its legality-and that of the Se lective Service System-was well established. Those who answered their coun try's call and served,  those who were  wounded or killed  in  that effort, and  those who were  imprisoned  in enemy  territory were the real ""heroes"" of that  era. Others who evaded their responsi bility have already been given a fair op portunity for clemency, which thousands  accepted. Our clemency program was by  far the most lenient amnesty program  administered in this country during the  20th century, and more than 5,000 full  pardons were individually granted under  the program. Thousands accepted alter native civilian service to compensate for  their evasion of duty. There is no need  for a sweeping Presidential pardon for  any military violators at this time.  There  is no virtue  in  assigning  a  ""moral heroism"" to draft evasion. It es tablishes a dangerous precedent and cer tainly must offend the conscience of any one who believes  in equal  justice and  fairness for all.  ORDER GRANTING PERMISSION TO  FILE UNTIL 5 P.M. TODAY  ",1977
68,Senate,95,0.307,1176,1,Mr. BELLMON.," Mr. President, on be half of the distinguished Senator from  Oklahoma  (Mr. BARTLETT),  I  introduce  a bill and I ask unanimous consent that  a  statement by Senator BARTLETT  be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the state ment was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follOWS:  STATEMENT BY  SENATOR BARTLETI'  Today I am introducing a blll to amend the  Meat Import Law in order to alleviate  the  serious financial condition of the livestock  producers of the United States. Total cattle  numbers are up,  and  the  supply-demand  situation is out of balance. Low beef prices  and high grain costs have distorted the mar ket as more and more cattle are going directly  from  the range  to slaughter. In 1974  the  ratio was approximately 45% non-fed to 55%  fed slaughtered. For 1975, the ratio changed  to approximately 35% non-fed to 65% fed.  The 1964 Meat Import Act was drafted in  such a manner as to allow imports from other  countries, primarlly grass-fed beef straight  from the range, to be increased in propor tion to total domestic production, including  non-fed and  fed cattle. This approach  to  beef imports has been counterproductive and  has further complicated an already difficult  situation. It makes little sense to allow more  imported beef into the country when there  is greater domestic beef production and to al low less imported beef when there is lesser  domestic production. The reverse, which does  make sense,  is the central provision of my  bill.  While I understand that many cattle pro ducers believe a  total beef import en1bargo  is justified. because of consumer and free in ternational trade convictions of many mem bers of Congress,  it appears unlikely  that  such action would be taken by the Congress.  In my opinion, the bill I am introducing is  a  reasonable compromise for all concerned.  Basically, it amends the Meat Import Law  in two Important ways: First, It would estab lish a new meat import base level for any  one-year period of 750 mllllon pounds, sub ject toadjustment either up or down based  on a new domestic production  ratio. This  compares to a llmit of 725.4 milllon pounds  under the current Meat Import Law which  was adjusted during the domestic overpro duction of 1975 to 1.3 billion pounds. Second,  future  Import adjustments will be based  upon a responsive relationship to a 1969-72  base period. If the ratio of domestic grain-fed  beef slaughter decreases  in comparison  to  total slaughter. foreign beef Imports would  be reduced on an equivalent basis.  However, 1f this ratio increased above the  73 percent established under the base period,  Imports would Increase accordingly. In such  a  case, we would  exceed  the 750 milllon  pound level.  A brief example will  illustrate how  this  would work: From 1969-72 the percentage of  total slaughter which was grain-fed was 73  percent. This 1969-72 period reflects opera tion of a relatively stable market and is used  for the base percentage. Since late 1973 there  has been economic adjustment in the beef  industry. This has  talmn  the form of  in creased domestic production of non-fed beef,  which must compete with foreign non-fed  beef Imports. The extent of this adjustment  is evident in the fact that fed-cattle market ings in the last quarter of 1974 fell to 60 per cent of the total beef slaughter, a decrease of  13 percent of  fed cattle during  the base  period. The 13 percent decrease represents a  17.8 percent change from the base period of  73 percent. This 17.8 percent decline in fed beef production would  then be ut111zed  to  further reduce the level of foreign beef im ports. Thus, the base of 750 milllon pounds  would be reduced on a quarterly basis by 17.8  percent so that total beef imports for  the  quarter  could  not  exceed  154.1 million  pounds-616.5 million pounds at an annual  rate.  The quarterly Import llmit of 154.1 milllon  pounds  is obtained by multiplying the 750  million-pound base limit by 17.8 percent, the  percentage decrease in the ratio of fed  to  total domestic slaughter in the last quarter  of 1974 compared to the fed to total domestic  slaughter of  the base period. This gives a  figure of 133.5 million pounds which, when  subtracted from the base level of 750 million  pounds, gives the annual rate o! 616.5 mil llon pounds. Dividing by 4  gives us  the  fourth quarter of 1974 limit of 154.1 million  pounds.  The 154.1 mlllion pounds under the for mula of this proposed amendment compares  to 300 million pounds per quarter which  could be Imported under the present act and  represents a  reduction of foreign beef im ports of nearly 50 percent when domestic  cattle conditions are critical.  Many American  llvestock producers  find  themselves near bankruptcy today because  of actions taken by this Government under  the economic stabilization program. Conse quently, I do not belleve it to be unrealistic  for  the Federal Government  to  take some  steps to alleviate the damage. Passage of this  bill is one action we can take which would  be beneficial  to both producers and con sumers in the long run.  Producers would know that large domestic  beef production wlll not result in their be ing penalized by ever-increasing foreign 1m ports.  Consumers would  benefit  from  a  stabilized meat  supply  situation because,  under our present meat import law, imports  go down as domestic production decreases.  while under my bill, periods of domestic pro duction decreases would bring about  In creased Imports.  This legislation is needed for the stab111ty  ",1977

70,Senate,95,-0.033,1228,1,Mr. MATHIAS.," Mr. President, I am  pleased again  to  join  today with  the  Senator from Massachusetts <Mr. KEN in introducing legislation which  would authorize the payment of fees for  attorneys and expert witnesses for citi zens participating in Federal agency pro ceedings and seeking judicial review of  agency actions.  If enacted, this proposal will provide  two significant improvements in the way  our agencies of Government function.  First, it would allow for greater partic ipation in the administrative process by  the general public. It would also move us  closer toward the goal of reform of our  regulatory agencies by helping to insure  that all sides are heard at agency pro ceedings, thus increasing the responsive ness of Federal decisionmakers  to  the  will of all our people.  In the past decade, our society has  greatly benefited  from  a  tremendous  growth in the number and effectiveness  of nonprofit public interest groups. This  legislation will give  these groups-and  all  other  public-spirited  citizens-far  broader input regarding the rulemaking  and other procedures of the regulatory  agencies which increasingly govern our  lives.  Our bill would allow participants in  rulemaking,  licensing, and other pro ceedings of Federal agencies  to recover  their attorneys' fees, expert witness fees,  and other costs of participation, up to a  reasonable amount. They would be reim bursed when and if the agency itself de.:.  termines that they represent an interest  which makes a substantial contribution  to the proceeding.  This legislation is clearly necessary at  a time when regulatory agencies exercise  more intricate control over our economic  lffe than ever before. In spite of many  recent efforts to open up the administra tive process to allow citizens to have some  infiuence on Federal agency decisions,  most proceedings have little or no pub lic involvement today. The high cost of  hiring attorneys and expert witnesses to  penetrate the complex  layers of  issues  under agency consideration and of pre paring and duplicating materials  for  presentation  the agencies makes  it  virtually impossible for most individuals  or organizations to participate. Ordinary  citizens obviously cannot be expected to  to  ",1977
71,Senate,95,0.489,1254,1,Mr. HANSEN.," Mr. President, the sen ior Members of the Senate will remem ber one of  their colleagues  from  the  early sixties, Milward L. Simpson.  Milward Simpson was elected to this  body  in 1962  from my home State of  Wyoming to continue his public service,  which included serving in the Wyoming  State Legislature, and la.ter as Governor  of that great State.  Milward Simpson brought with him to  Washington the integrity, honesty, and  public-mindedness  he  propounded  throughout his service in and to Wyo ming.  In 1966, Senator Simpson retired from  this distinguished body because he had  learned he had Parkinson's disease. Doc tors told him then that he had maybe  left, and so he returned to  1,000 steps  Wyoming.  Today, Governor Simpson,  now  79  years of age,  is still lending his spirit  and character to the people of Wyoming,  as was recently pointed out in an article  from the Denver Post of October 31, 1976.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that this article be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  [From the Denver Post, Oct. 31, 1976]  Mn.WARD L. SIMPSON  When Milward L. Simpson of Cody served  Wyoming as  legislator, governor and U.S.  Senator, he stood 6  feet  tall and weighed  185 pounds. Age--he will be 79 in 2 weeks and lllness has shrunk him to 5 feet 9 and  165, and he needs an arm crutch to walk.  But neither crippllng arthritis nor Park.in son's disease have shriveled his gift for pun gent phrases or his fierce dedication to what  he believes  is  right for Wyoming, and for  America.  ""I got the name 'Fiery Petrel' when I first  went to the state legislature because I was  always pointing out  the  right and wrong  of things,"" he says. ""The name was a takeoff  on the stormy petrel, the bird that is sup posed to bring storm warnings.""  These days, when Simpson makes a public  appearance, he is usually addressed as ""Mr.  Wyoming"" or ""Mr. Republican.""  But old-timers stlll call him ""Simp"" or  ""Simpy,"" though most folks address him as  ""Senator.""  Simpson prefers to be called ""Governor.""  ""The 100 senators ride off on their horses  in 100 directions,"" he explains. ""But a gov ernor is top gun in his state.  ""I think my best work for Wyoming was  done as governor. Nowadays, people seem to  feel the same.  ""I didn't do anything spectacular in the  Senate. I was elected in 1962, and early in  1966, while walking through a. Senate cor ridor, I fell fiat on my ding-dong and couldn't  get up. I had to crawl.  ""That's when the doctors told me I was  doomed by Parkinson's disease, that I had  maybe 1,000 steps left. New drugs since gave  me a lot more steps, but I didn't know that  then. So I retired. I was damned if I would  ask the people of Wyoming to send a handi capped man to Washington!""  Simpson was a few months short of qualify ing for a $22,000 annual senator's pension.  He  notes  with  indignation  that  some  ""phonies""  thought he  should conceal his  illness, run again and then quit when he had  the pension cinched. (Gov. Simpson does not  draw a pension from any of his elected posts.)  ""I could never consider something so dis honest,"" he declares. ""I knew senators so  senile or paralyzed they could not work or  find their way home.  ""I have always refused to compromise my  principles for possible personal benefit. Such  compromises are dangerous-they just take  you to a  lesser value. And the only values  worth having are the ones God gave us.""  That sentiment  is more  than  rhetoric:  Gov. Simpson  is a  former  lay preacher  in  the Episcopal Church.  He prays every morning in his Cody home  at the big livin,s  room window which frames  a view of the high cross atop Christ Episcopal  Church against Cedar and Rattlesnake Moun tains.  He also says grace at every meal, even in  restaurants, and after asking  the blessing  for the food, adds: ""God bless America and  keep her free from discord and confusion.""  Yet he can cuss a streak; he notes cheer fully that piety and earthliness come natu rally to a man ""whose father was a  cow puncher and whose mother attended church  for a century.""  1924 his  The governor was born Nov. 12, 1897, at  Jackson, Wyo., the youngest of the three chll dren of Margaret Burnett and Wllliam Lee  Simpson. His father, a native of Fort Lyon,  Colo.,  trailed cattle  into the Jackson Hole  area in 1884 and stayed to become a promi nent attorney before his death in 1940. His  mother, whose family settled in the South  Pass area in 1865, was 100 years old when she  died in 1974.  Young Milward spent his  first years  in  Lander, where  his  father was  Fremont  county prosecutor. (He was the only prose cutor, the governor proudly notes, who ever  managed  to convict  famed outlaw Butch  cassidy.)  Later, the family moved to Meeteetse, then  Cody.  Simpson graduated from Cody High School  in 1916 and enrolled at  the University of  Wyoming at Laramie. When America en tered World War I, he quit school to become  an infantry omcer. After the war, Simpson  returned to Laramie, earning his B.S. in 1921.  He went  to  law school at Harvard Uni versity but dropped out in his  third year.  ""People take it for granted that because  I am a lawyer, I have a law degree,"" he says.  ""But I received special dispensation from the  state district court to start practicing with out a degree and before taking the bar exam.""  The  reason was  dramatic.  In  father stood trial for murder.  ""We were living in Thermopolis then,"" the  governor says, ""but this happened in Cody.  Some guy my father had beaten in a lawsuit  attacked him on the street, hitting him on  the head with a  rock. My father shot the  man. It was self-defense and my father was  acquitted, but he had to drop his practice  because of his  injuries. The court allowed  me to take over.""  Simpson passed  the bar exam with high  marks in 1926, and that same year, at age 29,  was elected to the Wyoming Legislature.  ""I was the only Republican elected in Hot  Springs County,"" he says. ""Folks knew me  pretty well, not only because of my father,  but because  I was a hot semipro baseball  player.  ""I played  for Keene, N.H., while  I was  studying in the East, and I played center field  for Red Lodge, Mont., when  I was  home. Even had an offer to go to the big  leagues but my father made an impassioned  speech to me about ball players' legs only  lasting five years, so I never tried out.  ""My father, one of the most convincing  orators I ever heard, talked me into becom ing a Republlcan.  ""My parents were  terrific Democrats and  I blatted the Democratic cause all through  high school. But when I was 21 and about  to cast my first vote, ~ dad made one of  his speeches. He convinced me that Demo crats are fine, but Republicans always win,  so I registered as a Republlcan.  ""I have stayed on that side of the fence  ever since because I Uke  the GOP phllos ophy.""  When a  leader of the Women's Christian  Temperance Union  (WCTU)  demanded  to  know if the freshman  legislator was ""wet""  or ""dry,' Simpson replied:  ""Ma'am, I'm so wet if you blew on me,  I'd ripple.""  The WCTU lady stalked off before he could  explain:  ""You can't legislate morals  into  people. I  think Prohibition W!aS one of the  blackest periods in Americs.n history.""  Besides, Simpson admits with a laugh: ""In  those days I ctrank. They made a fine apricot  brandy around Cody for $5 a pint.""  One of Simpson's more-publicized legisla tive efforts was a bill reducing the residency  required for divorce in Wyoming from a year  to four months.  ""People pilloried me for attacking mar riage.  ""Heck, I wasn't even married then. I  to bring some divorce business  Wyoming. But the only thing I aooompllshed  was scaring Nevada into lowering its divorce  residency requirement to three months.""  wanted  just  to  ",1977
72,Senate,95,0.327,1306,1,Mr. GRIFFIN.," Mr. President, earlier  this week French authorities released a  man who claims to have masterminded  the Munich Olympic massacre in 1972.  Like many  of my  colleagues,  I  am  shocked by this turn of events.  Twice in the last half-century Munich  has been associated with opportunities  for the world to learn iniportant lessons.  Ironically and tragically on both occa sions the opportunity has been lost.  It was  in Munich on September 30,  1938, that leaders of Great Britain and  France caved  in  to Adolf Hitler and  allowed him to claim the Sudetenland.  As we know,  the hopes  they harbored  then that appeasement would somehow  buy peace quickly soured, and that action  led to a holocaust.  It was  in Munich almost exactly 34  years later that eight Black September  terrorists-reportedly under the leader ship of Abu Daoud-invaded the Israeli  dormitory at the 20th summer Olympic  games. When the shooting was over, 10  Israeli athletes, 1 German policeman,  and 5 Arab terrorists lay dead.  The Munich massacre was not simply a crime against Israel-it was a heinous  crime against all humanity. Allowing the  man who claims responsibility for this  senseless and brutal act to go free is a  new act of appeasement that can only  lead to further tragedy.  No wonder  the widow of Yosef Ro mano, one of the Israeli athletes mur dered at Munich, has said:  We have nothing but disgust for people  who sell blood for oil.  I  recognize  that France--like most  Western nations-is dependent on Arab  ",1977
73,,95,0.348,1345,1,Mr. KETCHUM.," Mr. Speaker, today I  ask that my colleagues join with me in  paying homage to the memory of a truly  great man, my good friend, Mr. Harry  Blair.  Harry's recent passing will  leave a  great void  in  the educational field of  Bakersfield, Calif., and I would like to  take a  few moments  to recognize his  many  contributions  during his  dedi cated lifetime.  Harry Blair served with distinction as  superintendent of schools in Kern Coun ty, Calif.,  for 13  years.  In  total, his  career with  the  county's educational  system spanned 28 years, and it may  truly be said that he gained the respect  and admiration of all who were priv ileged  to know him and to work with  him. His  contributions  to  education  began  in 1941, when he  taught  fifth  grade  in  the  Reedley  Elementary  Schools. Harry  interrupted his career  during World Warn, serving his coun try in the U.S. Army Air Force.  Harry will be remembered not only as  a man who gave much to education, but  also as an outstanding contributor  to  his community. In addition to his par ticipation in various professional organi zations, Harry served in numerous ca pacities with  the American  Cancer  Society; the United Fund; the Crippled  Children's Society; the Bakersfield Jun ior Chamber of Commerce; the American  Legion;  the Bakersfield Chamber  of  Commerce, and the Rotary Club. He was  a man who was never too busy to offer  his best whenever and wherever he was  needed.  I offer my sincere condolences to his  widow, Rosemary, and to his two sons,  Paul and Harry, Jr. I know that my col leagues will join me in paying tribute to  this fine man, whose shoes will be very  hard to fill.  I, for one, will miss him  greatly.  ",1977

77,Senate,95,0.078,54,5,Mr. HEINZ.," Mr. President, today I am  introducing  two bills designed  to help  communities in the United States deal  with the problem of abandoned school  buildings. Throughout the United States.  many elementary and secondary school  buildings have been forced to close due to  decreasing enrollment, shifts in popula tion,  consolidation, and various other  reasons not associated with structural  deficiency. In my State of Pennsylvania,  144 school buildings were closed between  Seotember 1975, and September 1976. A'l""\  additional 135 are slated for closure at  the end of the current academic year.  Mr. John Greenley, educational statistics  associate of  the Pennsylvania Depart ment of Education, has calculated that  at least 88 percent of the school build ings closed each year remain idle and  empty.  This situation, however, is by no means  limited to Pennsylvania; the same prob lem exists nationwide. Since 1972 in the  State of New York. 302  schools were  closed. In Salt Lake City alone, 23 schools  have been closed over the last 10 years  because of a gradual, 35 percent decrease  in enrollment.  In Wichita, Kans.,  six  school buildings have closed over the last  5 years, and by the end of this year in  Montgomery County, Md.,  14  school  buildings will have been closed  since  1975.  One of  the most complex problems  resulting from the declining enrollment  is what to do with school buildings that  are no longer needed. Many of these un used school buildings are structurally  sound and centrally located. They could  continue  to be valuable  resources  for  their  communitiec;  through  alternate  uses. The principal problem facing most  communities  in which  these buildings  are located is a lack of planning assistance and funds to convert these build ings for other productive uses.  The two bills I am introducing today  are designed  to provide some of  the  assistance  necessary  to  recycle  these  buildings. The Surplus School Conserva tion Act of 1977  is designed to provide  grants, on  a  limited and competitive  basis, to those communities that wish to  retain unused school buildings for other  productive purposes. The Surplus School  Conversion Act of 1977  is designed  to  encourage private industry to purchase  these buildings  for  transformation  to  alternate revenue producing enterprises  in situations in which the communities  no longer have a use for these buildings.  The reasons for the closing of these  schools, Mr. President, are  largely be yond our control. Recent projections of  public  school  enrollment by  the U.S.  Office of Education indicate a decline of  over 4 million youngsters in grades kin dergarten  through 12  in  the next 10  years. In addition  to declining enroll ment, many schools have been closed  due  to out-mobility of  the population.  We are a country of movers, with those  who move being apt to move again. So  we have the problem of overall popula tion decline made ~harper by out-migra tion.  What is in our control, Mr. President,  is  the ability  to provide assistance  to  communities in creating a plan for using  these  abandoned  buildings.  Once  a  school is closed, it does not mean that  the productive  life of  that building  is  over.  There  is  considerable  evidence  that unused school buildings can be put  to good alternative uses. Look at  the  following examples:  Dayton, Ohio, where a 2,200-student  high school has been converted  to a  center  for manpower  training,  adult  basic education, and community recrea tion center.  Kalamazoo, Mich., where a large high  school was relinquished to the city for  adult education, a private school, and a  senior citizens' center.  Westmoreland County, Pa., where one  elementary school is now a  junior col lege, and another has been  leased  to  the Navy Reserve which pays mainte nance costs  in return  for use of  the  building.  Ithaca, N.Y., where a building was  sold to an entrepreneur who recycled it  as a  shopping center, housing for the  elderly, and private offices; and  Claremont, Calif., where an old school  is now a shopping center.  To this list might be added walk-in  centers for counseling, drug abuse and  other rehabilitative programs, neighbor hood medical and dental clinics,  light  industry, warehouses, and many more.  Unfortunately, for every potential satis factory solution, there are scores of in stances of abandoned school buildings  serving no useful purpose.  Mr. President,  the purpose of  these  two bills is to provide Federal assistance  to enable communities to maintain and  operate, in the most efficient, creative,  and economical manner possible, closed  school buildings  for other productive  purposes determined by the communi ties themselves. These proposals are specific and pragmatic. They do not pre tend to solve serious problems overnight.  They are realistic steps needed to meet  a  growing problem and at  the  same  time will help increase the tax base for  many communities.  Mr. President, I have been receiving  tremendously encouraging support  for  these bills from school and municipal  officials  from  throughout  the country.  I commend to my colleagues the surplus  school conservation and surplus school  conversion acts in the firm belief that  through enactment, we can help com munities solve a very serious and grow ing problem. I believe that the bills I have  introduced are proper vehicles for our  efforts.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of these two bills as  well as the accompanying news article  focusing on this issue be printed as part  of the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bills and  article were ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  s. 792  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives  of  the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That this  Act may be cited as  the ""Surplus School  Conservation Act of 1977"".  FINDINGS AND PURPOSES  (3)  (2)  SEc. 2. (a) The Congress finds that-(1) declining enrollments and population  migration have caused many school closings  throughout the country;  the school buildings that have closed  represent valuable resources and should be  maintained and operated for other produc tive uses;  local governments lack the necessary  funds  to adequately maintain and operate  closed school buildings; and  (4) the Federal Government has a respon siblUty to assist local governments in main taining and operating closed school build ings with Federal funds.  (b) The purpose of this Act is to provide  grants to local governments for the mainte nance and operation, in the most efficient,  creative, and economical manner possible, of  dosed school buildings for productive pur poses, as determined by the respective com munities, including but not limited to edu cation and social service.

78,Senate,95,-0.108,80,5,Mr. CASE.," Mr. President, I am today  introducing a bill to help meet the en ergy problems of developing countries,  to develop markets for American indus try, and to promote the development in  this country of nonconventional, decen tralized energy technologies.  Joining with me  in sponsoring  this  legislation are Senators HuMPHREY, KEN NEDY, MciNTYRE, LEAHY, and HEINZ. Our  bill is part of a package of seven bills  being introduced in the Senate today by  myself and other Senators, including the  cosponsors of this particular bill.  All of the bills are designed to promote  the development and use of energy con servation, solar, wind, and other non conventional, decentralized energy tech nologies.  The bill I am introducing amends the  Foreign Assistance Act  to establish a  cooperative  program with  developing  countries  to  stimulate  commercializa tion of small-scale power systems that  can be used appropriately in developing  countries.  This  program will  help  developing  countries  reduce  their dependence on  high-priced imported oil and centralized  nuclear energy projects that can be dis torted into nuclear weapons projects.  In the process, it will develop a broader  market for American industry, thereby  encouraging further investment in these  technologies and permitting cost reduc tions  through  automated  production  lines.  Our bill authorizes an appropriation  of $10 million to the Agency for Inter national Development for a series of re gional studies, to be carried out in close  cooperation with private industry, to de termine what  technologies are appro priate  to  the climatic conditions and  energy needs of various developing coun tries. AID also  is directed to establish  a  comprehensive  information network  which American  industry can use  determine the energy needs of developing  countries and developing countries can  use to determine technologies available  to meet their needs.  Finally, our bill directs AID to begin  pilot projects as quickly as possible.  The types of projects and the tech nologies that can be used are not limited  by the bill.  The program could encompass the use  of wind machines now being developed by  American industry to pump water from  the shallow water tables of the Sahel to  irrigate the desert. Or it could promote  the use of mass-produced photovoltaic  cells to power television sets in schools  at  relatively  low  cost, permitting  the  to  viewing of educational programs carried  by communications satellites.  I believe this is an important bUl and  I hope that it will be given careful con sideration.  December 18, 1977,  By Mr. THURMOND:  S. 810.

81,House,95,-0.439,145,5,Mr. JOHNSON of California.," Madam  Chairman, the bill we bring before you  today, H.R. 11, would authorize an addi tional $4 billion in Federal grants for the  construction of local public works proj ects and correct the inequities in the first  round of funding.  President Carter has given his  full  support for  the $4 billion in increased  authorization of $4 billion and has re quested a  supplemental appropriation.  The President has made it very clear  that the Local Public Works Act is a vital  component of our overall strategy for  economic recovery.  Madam Chairman, there is little need  for a long explanation of this bill.  It was considered at length by  House last session.  With an unemployment rate nation ally close  to 8 percent  today, with 30  percent or more of our construction  workers still unemployed, and with our  State and local governments still caught  in the fiscal squeeze of our most recent  recession, it is vitally important that we  move  this  legislation  as  quickly  as  possible.  This legislation is directly targeted at  a segment of our economy that has, per haps, suffered the most from our recent  economic problems.  The construction and building trades  industry has been in the worst economic  decline this country has ever experienced  since the great depression of the 1930's.  The President of the ~CIO Build ing and Construction Trades Depart ment recently testified that unemploy ment levels were still at the unaccepta bly high rates of 20 to 30 percent in some  of our major cities.  Madam Chairman,  the construction  industry is a bellwether of our national  economy.  We must put our unemployed construc tion workers back to work, and that is  what this bill is designed to do.  In addition, a second and most impor tant goal of the local public works pro gram  is  to provide badly needed help  to local governments.  We know there are thousands of badly  needed public facilities that have been  deferred by our local governments.  This legislation provides for  lOO-per cent grants by  the Secretary of Com merce to assist State and local govern ments in the construction, renovation,  repair or other  improvement of  local  public works projects.  Mr. Chairman, our experience with the  first round of funds clearly shows that  we have developed an effective delivery  system.  This bill was very carefully designed  by the Committee on Public Works and  Transportation  to avoid  the  long  lag  times sometimes associated with public  works construction.  We were able to cut out the redtape  in this bill and require that project ap plications must provide assurances that  onsite labor could begin within 90 days.  Despite this requirement, which would  insure  that  only projects  that were  ""ready to go"" would be funded, the Eco nomic Development Administration re ceived more than 25,000 applications for  $24 billion in little more than 1 month.  The size of this response clearly con firmed the fact that there is a huge back log of local public facility projects that  are badly needed by communities in this  country and are ready to go into con struction.  I want to emphasize Madam Chairman,  that  these  applications were not  for  make-work projects. All of these projects  met some important need in our com munities-for the repair of roads, for re pair of a hospital, or the construction of  vitally needed water and sewer systems.  There were some ineQuities in the dis tribution of funds throughout the coun try.  Many of the problems that occurred in  the distribution of projects had  to do  with the legislation and we have tried  to correct these faults in H.R. 11.  Other inequities resulted from the reg ulations which developed formulas  for  IJroject ranking and selection.  The Committee on Public Works and  Transportation held 6 days of extensive  hearings  to uncover  the problems that  occurred in the program  We heard from more  than 100 wit nesses,  inluding  40 Members  of  the  House.  We liste:1ed to each witness very care fully, Madam Chairman, and we devel oped a serie~~ of amendments to the bill  based on then recommendations.  Madam Chairman, the Committee on  Public  Works  and  Transportation  through 1ts subcommittees on Economic  Development. and Investigations and Re view will hold oversight hearings on the  rules and regulations developed by the  Economic Development Administration  for  the administration of  this next $4  billion.  We inte!ld to make sure that EDA sim plifies the adll""!nistration of this program  ~o that the rul~s and regulations are more  easily underst< oOd.  The amendments we have made will  insure a more equitable distribution of  the projects throughout the country.  We have in::.ured that whenever pos sible, local officials will be given an op portunity to identify which projects re flect their priorities and needs.  And, we have eliminated any possi bility for a community to gerrymander  another community's unemployed labor  force  in defining their project area by  providing that only unemployment data  within the jurisdiction of the applicant  CXXIII--334-Part 5  I  will apply-sc that we target this $4 bil lion to our areas of greatest distress.  Madam Chairman, I want to thank BoB  RoE, the chairman of our Subcommittee  on Economic Development, for his tire less efforts in seeing this bill through both BoB RoE and JoHN PAUL HAMMElt SCHMIDT, the ranking minority member of  th~ subcommittee labored many long and  h~rd hours to make this bill possible to clay.  They not cnly have participated fully  in the hearings we held before the com mittee, but have worked diligently to iron  out the problem areas of this bill.  Finally, I want to particularly thank  all of the n~w members of our committee  tor their active participation in our hear ings and their work during our commit tee's markup on this bill.  ",1977
82,House,95,-0.056,145,5,Mr. LEVITAS.," Madam Chairman,  rise in support of H.R. 11. The local pub lic works program authorized by  this  legislation  is a vital component of our  national economic  recovery package. I  want  to  remind my  fellow  colleagues  that while we have heard that the econ omy is picking up, the aftermath of the  recession this country has experienced  during the last 2% years is by no means  over. Unemployment levels are going to  remain high for some time, and prob ably throughout the rest of the decade.  Today  there are still  some 8 million  Americans unemployed. The construc tion industry is still in a state of shock.  Unemployment levels are still up around  20 and 30 percent in major cities of the  Nation. And, there does not appear to be  any relief in sight. State and local con struction activity has been particularly  hard hit and this legislation is specifi cally directed to assist this segment of  the construction industry.  Although the Bureau of Labor Statis tics has proudly announced  that con struction unemployment is now at a 2year low hovering around 14 percent, the  seasonally unadjusted figures are more  realistic-20.1 percent or 961,000 men  out of work. If one looks further at these  statistics, the main reason for the de cline is that the number of persons that  have left the construction labor market  altogether, are not even counted. The  AFL-CIO's Building and Construction  Trades Department  just completed an  employment survey in January of 54 se lected communities in the country. The  figures in this survey confirm the fact  that the construction industry has suf fered  double-digit  unemployment  for  over 34 months now. I am including a  copy of the survey for the RECORD.  Madam Chairman, there is no ques tion  that  the 1976  local public works  program was a  success. The Economic  Development Administration  received  over 25,000 applications  totaling about  $24 billion when there was only $2 bil lion to distribute. Of the 22,000 appli cations that were finally considered 1,988  were selected  for  final processing and  a.pproval;  tr~eir total value was $1.95  billion. Out of these 1,988 projects more  than 300,000 jobs will be produced. Wltll  ",1977
83,House,95,-0.419,158,5,Mr. AKAKA.," Madam Chairman, I rise  in support of H.R. 11 as amended and I  ask for unanimous consent to revise and  extend my remarks.  I would like to thank Chairman RoE  and the Committee on Public Works, who  deserve high praise for such timely and  far-reaching legislation.  I would also like to commend Mr. FAR REN MITCHELL of Maryland and his COl leagues on their efforts to insure positive  action on minority interests.  In doing so this bill not only strives to  mobilize unemployed America, but also  insures that minority groups will have  the  right  to share  in  the building of  America.  Mahala.  ",1977
84,House,95,-0.578,158,5,Mr. STOKES.," Madam Chairman, I rise  in support of H.R. 11,  the Local Public  Works Capital Development and Invest ment Act amendments.  Madam Chairman, the rate of unem ployment recently rose in 33 States, with  at least 16 States either equaling or sur passing  the conservative national esti mate of 7.9 percent. Not insignificantly  the  rate of unemployment  for blacks  continues at twice the national average,  while the unemployment rate for black  youths  is a startling six  times the na tional average. All of  these facts and  figures point most strikingly to the need  for  the Congress and the President to  make job creation a chief component of  any economic stimulus package. This is  not  to  suggest  that public works  jobs  creation is a new concept. Twice during  the 94th Congress, President Ford vetoed  emergency  public  works  legislation,  which he characterized as ""an election  year pork barrel."" Yet, Congress matched  President's Ford's ""pork barrel"" rhetoric  with a $2 billion emergency public works  program which coincided with the real ism of an American people who wanted  jobs.  Madam Chairman, though we in Con gress were pleased  to secure $2 billion  for  the creation of  emergency public  works jobs, it would be an overstatement  to  conclude  that we were  satisfied.  Clearly, we were not for we knew that  the jobless deserved more.  Madam Chairman,  the Local Public  Works Capital Development and Invest ment Act amendments are more. They  would increase from $2 billion to $6 bil lion the authorization for title I of the  Public Works Employment Act of 1976.  These funds would be focused as direct  Federal grants  for  local public works  projects. The result would be the crea tion of more than 600,000 new jobs pri marily  in  the construction and related  industries.  Not insignificantly, the funds for this  legislation would be earmarked for  the  areas hardest hit by unemployment. Spe cifically, H.R. 11 would require that 70  percent of the funds appropriated would  go for projects of State and local gov ernments evidencing an unemployment  rate in excess of the na tiona! average.  Moreover, H.R. 11 would delete  the  requirement of the 1976 act which man dated that 30 percent of total funding  go to applicants whose jurisdiction lias  an employment rate above 6.5 percent  but below the national average. Madam  Chairman, in this manner the poor and  those most in need would truly benefit.  H.R. 11  also helps  to preserve  jobs.  Under  the  terms of  its authorization  there is a provision requiring the use of  materials made and manufactured with in the United States. This section would  dissuade the use of cheaply manufac tured foreign construction materials and  thus maintain jobs.  Madam Chairman, as enlightened as  the Local Public Works Capital Develop ment and Investment Act amendment.'  are, they are not perfect. Their job cre ation capacity not only falls short of the  need, but the amendments do not ad dress the problem of unemployment in  the minority construction sector. In this  sector there  is currently an unemploy ment rate of 35 percent. In addition 20  percent of the complementary construc tion  industries, which  are  owned by  blacks, have failed for want of work.  To rectify the shortcomings of H.R. 11,  I plan to work for an increased author ization and support the Mitchell amend ment which requires that 10 percent of  the  articles, materials,  and  supplies  which will be used in public works proj ects must be procured  from minority  business enterprises.  Madam Chairman  and my  distin guished colleagues,  I urge you  to  join  with me in support of the Local Public  Works Capital Development and Invest ment Act amendments. The passage of  this vital legislation not only represents  a  ray of hope for the poor and down trodden but serves as a notice  the  American people  that Congress  is sin cere in its commitment  to eradicating  unemployment.  ",1977
85,House,95,-0.377,158,5,Mr. MOFFETT.," Madam Chairman,  this is a significant piece of legislation, a  bill designed specifically  to put people  back to work quickly, at a time when our  economy is in a dangerously weak condi tion and unemployment is raging at rec ord levels.  The country needs it desperately-par ticularly my own part of the Nation, the  hard-hit Northeast. I hope my colleagues  will not permit its effect to be blunted  by this amendment.  Public works projects, with good rea son, are targeted to help areas hardest  hit by unemployment. Therefore, to pro pose a uniform per-capita distribution  of funds--which is what allocation based  on the actual number of people unem ployed in a State rather than on the per centage unemployed would do-is to un dermine the purpose of a public works  program.  I  understand Members  from States  with relatively low unemployment rates  have argued  that  this  formula would  provide a more equitable distribution of  funds. However, the money is most ur gently needed by  the areas struggling  with unemployment rates far above the  national average, and will have its great est impact if it is spent there.  to  to  is  to 16  If we are striving to ease unemploy ment, then it makes the most sense to  spend the money  in communities,  like  many of those in my State, struggling  with unemployment rates of up  percent.  The passage of  the Shuster amend ment would create a  terrible precedent.  The premise underlying  this bill  is  direct help to areas with severe unem ployment. That implies that the hard hit States like Connecticut, New Jersey,  and Michigan will not have funds di verted to States with less severe unem ployment.  Mr. LE F ANTE. Madame Chairman, I  rise in support of H.R. 11, the Local Pub lic Works Capital Development and In vestment Act  amendments, which  aimed at creating jobs quickly in areas  hardest hit by unemployment.  The public works job effort is a signifi cant part of the Carter administration's  economic recovery program. It is also of  vital importance to the more than 7 mil lion people in this country who are cur rently out of work. While  this public  works program obviously will not solve  all our unemployment problems, it will  give a much needed boost to our sagging  economy and provide immediate relief to  the construction industry, whose unem ployment rate is two to three times that  of the general population.  The  legislation will also benefit  this  country's financially-pressed communi ties by offering Federal assistance  to  State and  local governmental  jurisdic tions for construction, repair, rehabilita tion or  improvement of  local facilities  such as schools and hospitals, water and  sewer systems, and -police and fire pro tection facilities.  The committee has made some  im portant changes  in  the existing public  works program which I believe will pro vide for more equitable distribution of  funds. Improvements made in the pro gram as a result of recent experiences in  allocating the $2 billion of Federal funds  last year should insure that priority will  be given  to  those States and localities  with the greatest need.  We must not lose sight of the fact that  the purpose of this legislation is to pro vide jobs immediately in those areas that  have been hardest hit by unemployment.  As a representative from New Jersey, a  State which consistently has an unem ployment rate higher than the national  average, I have seen the effects of job lessness firsthand. I  firmly believe that  the bulk of the aid contained in this bill  should be concentrated  in  those areas  with the highest percentage and num bers of unemployed. For that reason, 1  strongly support the bill as reported out  by the Public Works and Transportation  Committee of the House.  I was very pleased to note the com mittee's intention  to continue holding  oversight hearings as the new program  regulatio~s are developed to help achieve  the objectives set by this legislation.  Madam Chairman,  the  local  public  works jobs program is a very important  part of the battle against unemployment  in this country. In addition, public works  ",1977

91,House,95,-0.258,184,5,Mr. PANETTA.," Madam Chairman, I  move to strike the requisite number of  words.  Madam Chairman,  I would  like  to  add my voice to those today who have  expressed  their  support  and  admira tion for  the work done by the Public  Works Committee,  under  the  chair man  of  the  committee,  the  distin guished gentleman from California (Mr.  JOHNSON) , and under the chairman of  the Economic Development Subcommit tee,  the distinguished gentleman from  New Jersey <Mr. RoE). The subcommit tee heard more than 100 witnesses and  developed what I believe to be a much  improved local public works program.  In addition, I would like to say that I  am greatly pleased with the changes the  committee has made  in  the allocation  guidelines for additional authorization.  Specifically, I would cite the following  changes:  First. Only those who have previously  applied will be eligible for the increased  authorization.  Second. The unemployment statistics  used in the formula will be based on a  12-month, rather than a 3-month pe riod, which will allow fluctuations in un employment to be taken into considera tion. This is particularly significant for  rural areas, where employment  is sea sonal.  Third. The  new  guidelines  require  that all funds now go only to areas above  the national average in unemployment.  The previous guideline allowed 30 per cent of the funds to go to areas below the  national level of unemployment.  Fourth. Applicants are now allowed to  indicate their own priorities for funding  when they submit more than one appli cation.  Fifth. Areas must now use only the un employment statistics  from  their own  immediate jurisdiction, which will elim inate manipulation of such statistics.  Madam Chairman, I would like to ask  the distinguished gentleman from New  Jersey <Mr. RoE)  if there is in the bill  any special consideration for the many  areas of the Nation that have suffered  greatly from drought, cold, snow, and  flood. It would seem reasonable that this  bill, which is designed to provide immed iate assistance to specially targeted areas  of economic suffering, should take into  account  applications  from  designated  emergency or disaster areas.  In California alone, estimates of agri cultural unemployment  resulting  from  the drought run to 48,000  jobs, with a  minimum $3 billion loss in the agricul tural industry. When the secondary im pact on related industries is computed,  the figures run to 144,000 jobs lost and  a $9 billion loss to the State's economy.  Economists consider these figures con servative.  Department of Agriculture studies of  soil moisture indicate a similar loss in  Washington, Oregon,  Idaho,  and  the  great Red River Valley areas of the Mid west. My colleagues from Kansas, Iowa,  and Wisconsin, among others have been  deeply concerned about  the  impact of  the drought on their States' farms.  Needless  to say,  the suffering of the  Northeast during  this winter has been  immense. Unemployment due to natural  gas shortage and snowfall has effected  the diverse States of Florida, New York,  Michigan,  and many others. Between  October 1976 and the present 417 emer gency areas in 13 States and 132 disaster  areas in seven States have been desig nated by the Federal Government.  Madam Chairman, I would respectfully  say that it is my hope that some special  consideration will be given  to assisting  these areas under the Local Public Wor ;;:s  Act. I feel strongly that this bill is ideally  suited  to helping  to alleviate  the ag gravated primary and secondary unem ployment in these areas.  ",1977

93,House,95,0.416,197,5,Mr. MILLER of Ohio.," Madam Chair man, today we consider a bill that seeks  to sustain an accelerated public works  program and repair its deficiencies which  were either ignored or unanticipated last  fall when Congress rushed  through its  enactment and funding.  Continuation  of  the  Local  Public  Works and Capital Development and In vestment Act of 1976 at a higher funding  level is now an integral part of the ad ministration's economic stimulus pack age, not because it has proven to be so  successful in putting people to work, but  because it is so politically popular.  Last December when EDA announced  its title I approvals, the basic allocation  flaws of the program became apparent.  The 70/30 percent funding provision  favored those applicants in the 30 percent  category. Gerrymandering of unemploy ment rates led to duplication of applica tions and diversion of funds away from  critically high unemployment areas. The  unemployment data was too imprecise to  afford  accurate  calculations. Qualified  applications were denied because of local  processing  errors.  Some  applicants  loaded up on applications and thus had  a more favorable approval rate.  The  act's deficiencies which  led  to  these and other inequities were not un recognized last year when we considered  this act. Last August,  in my minority  views to the Appropriations Committee's  report to fund Public Law 94-364, I made  tho following obseravtions:  MINORITY VIEWS OF HONORABLE CLARENCE E.  MILLER  The three days of Committee hearings on  this bill only  served  to validate and  re enforce  the President's July 6 veto of the  Public Works Employment Act of 1976.  PL 94-369  is the classic example of Con gress promising that which cannot be rea sonably delivered.  If  the nation's unem ployed  rest  their hopes on working again  with this kind of Congressional hocus pocus,  then they are in store for bitter disappoint ment. The wage earner desperately trying to  make ends meet is in for another inflation ary shock when the $4 . billion cost of this  bill starts rippling through the economy.  At best  the Act  supposedly will  create  160,000  jobs, not the 325,000  jobs its spon sors projected, at a per job cost of $25,000.  Its impact will be felt neither now nor in  the immediate future, but primarily in late  1977 and 1978 when  the economy will be  well advanced in its recovery stage. Finally,  the money that will be borrowed to fund its  provisions will stimulate inflation at a  time  when fiscal restraint is dictated.  More questions about the Act's implemen tation, cost, and effect were  raised during  the course of the Committee's hearings than  were answered. The  legislative  intent may  be clear to those who are going to adminis ter the various  titles but the Act's infra structure is so handicapped and poorly con ceived as to make implementation difficult  if not impossible. For example, under title  II it is unclear what unemployment data is  to be used in the allocation formula, how  the states are to accomplish intrastate allo cations, which governmental units are eligi ble for funds, and how economization assur ances are to be achieved. Even more funda mental to title II is what jobs are basic to  the maintenance of local governmental serv ices. Paradoxically,  local school boards are  not  eligible  for  title  II personal  services  funds but are eligible for title I construction  funds.  The Act is replete with totally unrealistic  time deadlines that will create an adminis trative nightmare. For example under title I  within the initial sixty day review/approval  period, among other requirements, a  favor able Environmental Impact Statement must  be obtained. Anyone who has had experience  with an EIS knows that it can be a lengthy,  complex undertaking certainly one that in  many cases cannot be accomplished over night or within  two months.  In addition,  the requirement that ninety days after proj ect approval construction must start does  not take into account the inevitable chal lenges many bids are subjected  to  locally.  The rub  is  that when a  project does not  start within ninety days,  the Act requires  the funds to be deobligated.  Because  title  I  further  l'equires that an  application not processed and  reviewed by  EDA within sixty days 1s automatically ap proved, enormous pressure will be placed on  the agency to push paper. With only cursory  review the result may well be approval of  constructions of questionable quality and  solvency.  I  am also concerned  that smaller com munities without the capab11ity to gear up  quickly and submit an application package  title I w111 be denied program participation  'regardless of the severity of its unemploy ment.  Those  political  subdivisions well advanced in the area of grantsmanship will  fare much better in getting more than their  share of the pot.  In addition, I  think we will see the sub stitution of  the easy 100%  federal money  under title I for local money that is readily  available to do the same construction work  as wen as some double dipping into each of  the title pots.  Too many unanswered questions about the  Act  remain  justify  this appropriation.  to  The Committee simply does not know how  much it will cost to administer the program,  how many new bureaucrats will be needed,  what the paperwork burden will be, where  the benefits will go, who will receive them  and what their extent will be, and finally  what the real inflationary impact will be.  What the Congress has created here are not  new job opportunities but an election year  illusion for the folks back home. No matter  how politically expedient it may be, pump ing $4 billion the Federal Government does  not have into the economy to produce a few  $25,000  sible.  jobs  is still economically  irrespon to  Madam  Chairman, when  Congress  draits a pretty shoddy piece of legisla tion and then pumps money into it, we  can expect the end results to be flawed.  In this bill the committee takes a stab  at cleaning up some of the act's more ob vious deficiencies. Through the amenda tory process, I hope we can make even  more improvements. However, there still  remains the question of how valid is the  basic concept of accelerated public works  in permanently reducing unemployment.  The act's employment impact is short  term. Permanent positions  to meet a  growing labor force still must be created  after approved projects are completed.  The cost/benefit ratio per job under the  act is still difficult to justify. The time  lag between planning and actual con struction of projects gives stimulus at a  future date when stimulus may not be  needed.  It should be clear that the $4 billion  H.R. 11 authorizes to be spent is money  we do not have in current revenues. Be cause the Treasury will have to borrow  more funds, added inflationary pressures  will be created  in  the credit markets.  Those moneys soaked up in those credit  markets  fund  this act will not be  available to expand private employment.  The  labor market becomes more dis torted and unstable.  Finally, the allocation procedure will  always be imperfect because the Govern ment can never adequately distinguish  among  the variances  in  local employ ment conditions and community needs  and target Federal money effectively.  This public work's program has de veloped its own momentum. I hope the  Congress  is not deceiving  itself as  to  what this program will actually do and  how much it will cost.  ",1977

95,,95,0.213,236,5,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. Speaker, some one once said, ""there is nothing common  about  commonsense,""  and with  that  quote in mind, I would like to place in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  today a copy  of an editorial recently run in the Sioux  Falls Argus-Leader that was sent to me  by Mr. George Robertson of Sioux Falls,  S. Dak. 'Ihe editorial is worthy of our  review as it cites  the reasons why the  State of South Dakota has successfully  avoided any bonded indebtedness. I can not help but to wonder aloud if we in  Congress might not learn something from  the fiscal sanity now being practiced in  South Dakota.  PIERRE FiscAL SANITY AND WASHINGTON  FOOLISHNESS  South Dakota ls one of the few states in  the nation that do-esn't have a bonded debt.  It 1s one of the few states that lives within  its means.  The reasons for fiscal sanity in Pierre are  found in the South Dakota Constitution. The  constitution requires the legislature, if ordi nary  expenses  exceed  income,  to  levy  a  property tax of not to exceed two mills to  make up the deficit. A state mill levy hasn't  been used for  this purpose  for years. The  state has been in the black consistently. An other provision in the South Dakota Consti tution  limits  the  state's  indebtedness  to  $100,000.  South Dakota voters  in 1978 may get to  vote  on  another  constitutional  brake on  state  spending. The South Dakota House  passed a  resolution calling for a constitu tional amendment which would prohibit tax  increases without a  two-thirds vote of the  legislature or a vote of the people. The reso lution  also has  a  provision  limiting  the  property tax assessment at 60 per cent un less changed as required by th-e  resolution.  The Senate should enable the South Dako ta electorate to vote on this resolution. If it  becomes a part of the constitution, it could  do much  to  inhibit increased spending. It  might  also discourage  requests  from  the  public for government at Pierre to do things  for them that they can do themselves.

ANDERSON  ing  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 24, 1977  ",1977
96,,95,0.3,249,5,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, yesterday  the House voted  to approve  the  third  concurrent resolution on the budget for  fiscal year 1977. This resolution accom modates President Carter's  economic  stimulus program and provides for in creased Government spending of $19 bil lion. Mr. Speaker, you cannot spend your  way to prosperity. If we could, New York,  N.Y., and Britain would be prosperous,  indeed.  There was an alternative to this pro gram offered by  the minority, which  would have cut all tax rates by an equal  amount, roughly 22 percent across the  board. I think that it is a tragedy to the  working people of America and those who  want to work that this amendment was  not  adopted,  because  it would have  brought us a  lot closer to the goals we  are all interested in, that is full employ ment and real economic growth without  inflation.  The  fact  is  that President Carter's  program and those who voted for spend ing $19 billion more, does nothing about  the fundamental  reasons for  the eco nomic slump we are now in. The princi pal reason is, the high taxes and the in flation that has increased the real tax  burden in this country tremendously by  pushing individual incomes into higher  tax brackets without increasing real pur chasing power. The result is a net loss  in real aftertax income. This, in turn, has  built in great disincentives, to produce,  to hire, to work, and to invest.  The  situation  today  is  exactly  the  same situation which we encountered in  the early 1960's. At that time, President  Kennedy proposed massive across-the board cuts  in  individual and business  taxes. The result was that the economy  was stimulated so strongly  that  there  was a net increase in Government reve nues caused by expansion of the tax base,  rather than a revenue loss. As Professor  AN OPEN  FRANK  LETTER  TO  SENATOR  CHURCH  REGARDING  CONFIRMATIONOFPAULWARNKE  HON. STEVEN D. SYMMS  OF  IDAHO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 24, 1977  ",1977
97,,95,0.687,249,5,Mr. SYMMS.," Mr. Speaker, President  Carter's nomination of Paul Warnke to  head  the U.S. Arms Control and Dis armament Agency and to be Chief U.S.  Negotiator at the SALT talks with the  Soviet Union has aroused considerable  controversy throughout America.  I have written the following open let ter to Senator FRANK CHURCH, the senior  Senator from my State of Idaho, urging  him to vote against confirmation of Mr.  Warnke.  I would like to share this letter with  my colleagues in the Congress:  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, D.C., February 23, 1977.  Hon. FRANK CHURCH,  Russell Senate Office Building,  Washington, D.C.  DEAR SENATOR CHURCH: During  the four  years that we have worked  together in the  Congress of the United States, we have fre quently disagreed as to our conclusions of  how best to address the problems facing our  country, but  I  have always  respected  the  sincerity of your convictions. Consequently,  I  have never attempted  to  influence your  vote in the U.S. Senate.  However, the nomination of Paul Warnke  as Director of  the Arms Control and Dis armament Agency and as Chief Negotiator  for the Strategic Arms Limitation talks re quires me to break with this tradition. I am  asking you to ple1se consider the following  points which argue for a vote against con firmation of Paul Warnke:  (1) Paul Warnke is on record as being op posed to development and production of the  B-1 Bomber, the Trident Submarine and the  Cruise Mis~iles-all of which will come under  discussion  in  the SALT negotiations. The  fact that Mr. Warnke  is already on record  as opoosed to these systems will make it very  difficult for him to negotiate effectively for  a balanced SALT II treaty. The Soviets will  be in a position to simply utilize his own  arguments  against  these  systems and  initiatives by  for  the  unilateral disarmament  United States.  (2) During the confirmation hearings  in  5403  ts  the Senate, Mr. Warnke's own testimony has,  at times, been self-contradictory as to where  he really stands on arms control issues. Fo1  example, when questioned about his opposi tion  to  the B-1 Bomber, he responded by  stating  that he  favored  the concept of a  stand-off bomber utilizing cruise missiles as  an alternative to the B-1; yet, he is on record  as being opposed to the cruise missile pro gram.  (3) Mr. Warnke has demonstrated amaz ing misjudgements about  technology. For  example, he has been surprised by short term  developments  in the area of multiple  warheads  (MffiVs)  by  the Soviet Union something  that an adequate arms adviSer  should have foreseen  (others did)-and by  our own cruise missile  technology. This  disturbing since as an arms adviser he would  have  to  judge  technological  trends  in the  closed Soviet society.  (4) Mr. Warnke apparently does not recog nize that the Soviet Union considers nuclear  superiority over the United States to be a  worthwhile goal and that such superiority is  polttically useful.  (5) Since Mr. Warnke has been nominated  to head both the Arms Control Agency and  the SALT negotiating team, he would have  more  in:fiuence  than any other adviser  in  evaluating SALT proposals and negotiating  points. To concentrate so much power in one  man with one point of view is a eon:filct of  interest and could well be contrary to our  national security.  In conclusion, Mr. Warnke's opposition to  nearly every major U.S. weapon system that  could be at issue in the SALT talks is cer  tain to undermine his effectiveness in ""hard ball"" negotiations with  the Soviet Union.  Thus,  the  confirmation  of PaUl Warnke  would send out the wrong signal and could  well set our progress towards a stable nuclear  balance back several years.  Consequently,  I  again urge you  against his confirmation.  Sincerely,  to vote  STEVE SYMMS,  Member of Congress.  HAS TORRIJOS ADDED  IDS LAST  FOREIGN MINISTER TO PANAMA'S  EXILE LIST?  HON. GENE SNYDER  OF KENTUCKY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, February 24, 1977  ",1977
98,,95,0.26,249,5,Mr. SNYDER.," Mr. Soeaker, the state  Department blindly insists Panama has  a stable government on which the United  States can rely. The truth is, a tragicomic  opera  script writer  could  not  have  dreamed up a better plot as Panama's list  of exiles gets longer.  Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker is now  negotiating a new treaty with Panama's  third  Foreign Minister  in  some  10  months.  First,  Juan Tack  resigned--or was  fired-ostensibly because of his alleged  connections with Panama's drug traffic.  Tack was succeeded on April 2, 1976, by  Ambassador  to  the United Nations,  Aquilino Boyd.  Boyd  suddenly  resigned--or  was  fired--on February 9, being repla-:ed by  Ambassador to the United States, Nicolas  Gonzalez Revilla.  Only 8 days later, Boyd, who long con demned the Canal Zone as an imperialist  enclave, drove into the Zone, and with  ",1977
99,,95,-0.444,262,5,Mr. STUDDS.," Mr. Speaker, the prob lem of oil tanker safety is one which has  gained  great  prominence  .in  ~ece~t  months due to a series of maJor 011 SPill  incidents on both coasts and on several  of our inland waterways. It is mo~e th.an  coincidence that most of these oi;l spills  have resulted from oil tankers fiymg the  flags  of  foreign  nations,  particularly  that of Liberia. Mr. John Kifner, a re porter for the New York Times, recently  did a story on this subject which I be lieve would be of  interest  to my col leagues:  LIBERIA: A PHANTOM MARITIME POWER WHOSE  FLEET IS STEERED BY BIG BUSINESS  (By John Kifner)  ""The day of the gunboat 1s over,"" William  T. Coleman,  then Secretary of Transporta tion, told the members of the Senate Com merce Committee last month as the Senators,  aroused by a series of oil spills and wrecks  involving  Liberian-fiag  tankers,  began  a  series of hearings.  Explaining why there was little regulation  or control over foreign-flag ships bringing on  to  this country, he  said  that  the United  states could no longer ""take a gunboat and  put it beside Liberia and say,  'If you don't  do so and so, we will not let your ships out.' ""  But,  in  fact, Liberian-fiag shipping,  the  largest merchant fleet in the world. has lit tle to do with Liberia or Liberians.  Rather, it is a phantom maritime power  that was created by American businessmen  under a former American Secretary of State,  the late Edward R. Stettinius Jr. It is crucial  to the movement of oil around the world, and  it serves the interests o! the major oil com panies and shippers.  To them, the flag o! Liberia is an economic  boon, a device  that frees  them of national  restrictions and therefore lets them operate  more cheaply and profitably. Liberia,  too,  benefits; it derives 8 percent of its gross na tional product from that system.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  To critics, it is a system that allows danger ously unsafe ships and crews to ply the seas  and pollute the shores.  HEADQUARTERS IN MANHATTAN  The ships  flying  the star and stripes of  Liberia are controlled not from Monrovia, the  man-made port built with American aid in  the small West African nation, but  from  suites of  offices  at  103 Park Avenue  in  Manhattan.  Calls there are answered ""683-2030.""  That New York switchboard can connect  a caller to Captain Alister Crombie, Deputy  Commissioner for Maritime Affairs,  the Li berian government official in charge of issu ing licenses and overseeing shipping.  At the same number, the caller can also  reach:  Guy E. c. Maitland, the executive direc tor of a 62-member association of the own ers of ship:; registered in Liberia.  Frank Wiswall, an admiralty lawyer with  the New York  firm  of BurUngham, Under wood & Lord, who is the chief adviser to the  Maritime Bureau,  the director of the rel~­ tively new  inspection system and Liberia s  most  important  representative at  interna tional shipping conferences.  Fred T. Lininger, who 1s a senior deputy  commissioner for maritime affairs, as well as  a senior vice president of the International  Bank of Washington, which owns the Inter national Trust of Liberia., which in turn op erates the maritime system.  None are Liberian.  INTERLOCKING DIRECTORATES  Mr. Lininger, who was for many years 1\ir.  Stettinius's personal assistant, has run the  Liberian shipping operation 1n New York  since 1948. He is a senior vice president of  the International Bank and chairman o! the  board of Liberian Services  Inc., which  is  owned by  International Trust and which  provides services  to  the Liberian Maritime  Administration and helps companies incor porate thexnselves in Liberia. The president  of Liberian Services is Mr. Wiswall, the ad miralty lawyer.  Mr. Lininger, Mr. Wiswa.ll and Mr. Malt land of the owners' group also serve on Li berian delegations  to  the United Nations sponsored  international meetings  to  set  maritime safety rules.  In a telephone interview, Mr. Lininger said  that he saw ""no conflicts"" between what he  described as ""my corporate role and my gov  ernment role.''  But those who run the Liberian shipping  operation are concerned that the publicity  over the oil spills and the wrecks will hurt  the system they have set up. They see it as  the worst situation since 1971, when  two  Liberian-fiag ships ran into each other in the  English Channel, causing the authorities to  announce that they had set up an inspection  system.  The  shipowners' associa tlon  hired Carl  Byoir & Associates, a prominent New York  publlc relations firm, on Jan. 15. In addition,  they are undertaking an  investigation  of  the wreck of  the Argo Merchant, which  caused  the  largest oil spill off  the United  States coast. The investigation is being co ordinated by Mr. Lininger.  Some ships  flying  the Liberian  fiag are  owned by well-known companies and persons  such as D. K. Ludwig of National Bulk Car riers Inc. and its subsidiary, Universe Ship ping, America's largest shipowner, Y. K. Pao  and c. Y. Tung, both of Hong Kong, believed  to be No. 1 and No. 2 in worldwide shipping;  Aristotle Onassis and Stavros Nlarchos; and  seven  international oil  companies, Exxon,  Mobil, SoCal, Texaco, Gulf, B. P. and Shell.  TWO DIFFERENT FLEETS  Many of these ships are, as Mr. Maitland  and other spokesmen for the Liberian ship ping  interests contend, among  the newest,  best equipped and most expensive  in  the  world.  February 24, 1977  But, Robert J. Blackwell, the assistant sec retary of maritime  affairs  in  the United  States Maritime Administration,  told  the  Senate Commerce Committee recently, ""You  have two different types of fleets in that fiag  of convenience registry.  ""Many are out to make the cheapest buck,  to put on the cheapest crew,"" he said. ""They  avoid maintaining their vessels.''  Thus, among Liberian-flag ships are those  run by  less well-known operators  ,such as  Amerships Inc., operator of  the Argo Mer chant, the ill-starred tanker that broke up  off Nantucket Isla.nd.in December, releasing  7.5 m1llion gallons of oil. Amerships oper ated  seven other second-hand ships, each  owned by a separate Liberian corporation, a  device which served to hide the identity of  investors and  to  limit  liabllity 1n case of  suits.  ""The fact is, you can't expect small coun tries who gather a great deal of their revenue  from registering foreign ships or registering  ships owned by other economic interests in  their countries to exercise stringent control  of  those ships,"" Mr. Blackwell said. ""They  want that revenue. They want those fees. If  Panama        to Liberian. I! the Liberians  do it, they go to Malaysia.''  LIBERIA BENEFITS  Ship  registration  fees make up about 8  percent of Liberia's gross national product,  according to Mr. Maitland of the shipowners'  association. It costs $1.20 a ton to register a  ship in Liberia !or the first time and 10 cents  a ton annually thereafter.  One of the most important factors in ship owners' desire for Liberian registry, accord ing  to Ph111p J. Loree,  the director of the  Federation of American Controlled Shipping,  which represents 20 American shippers using  the Liberian and Panamanian flags,  is  the  high cost of American maritime union labor.  He contended the foreign-flag system is the  only way to keep American shippers in the  competitive market without the heavy gov ernment  subsidies  pa1d  to American-flag  ships.  For a 50,000-ton tanker, relatively typical  of those bringing oil into American ports, a  32-man crew would cost $1.7 m1111on a year  at American wages, Mr. Loree said.  In contrast, he said, by using the Liberian  flag, a shipowner can hire crews of other na tionalities at the following rates: all-Itallan,  $600,000 a year; British, $500,000; Spanish,  $450,000; Greek, $325,000; Chinese, $250,000,  and F111pino, $250,000.  What he described as a ""motley crew,"" one  made up of various nationalities, would cost  about $200,000 a year. Such a crew, of Greek  ofiicers and Pakistanis, Filipino, Honduran  and other crewmen, manned the Argo Mer chant.  Further, Mr. Loree said, the cost of using  American shipyards, as required under Amer ican registration, would be about twice as  much, again because of wages. He said a  typical  200,000-ton  supertanker  costing  about $90 million in the United States could  be built for about $40 million in Japan.  The ""flag of convenience"" system goes back  to  the early days of World War II when,  along with Lend-Lease, it was used to send  aid to beleaguered Britain while preserving  technical neutrality. For many years, Pan ama was the leading flag of convenience, al lowing American shipowners, for example, to  avoid such requirements o! American reg istry as the use of American crews and ship yards.  The public rationale for this system was  strategic: to keep American oil ships, which  were being registered under other flags be cause of high labor costs, within ""effective  control"" under the flag of a friendly nation in  the event of war. Those involved made mil lions.  Stressing the slogan that the shipping was  ""American-controlled"" and would be readily  available to return to United States direction  ",1977
100,Senate,95,-0.344,288,5,Mr. WILLIAMS.," Mr. President, I am  today  introducing  legislation  which  would amend the Tariff Schedules of the  United States to provide duty-free treat ment of any aircraft engine used as a  Ena~tment of t~?-e b11l  a s~udy _by  U.S. TARIFF SCHEDULES  is  .  to  is,  to  ently, our aircraft overhaul and repair  centers must compete with centers  in  Great Britain, Sweden, France, Brazil,  Taiwan, and Australia for much of theit  business. Even on this continent, our air craft engine service shops  face heavy  competition  from  companies  such  as  Rolls Royce of Canada and United Air craft of Canada. These Canadian enter prises are not operating under the same  disadvantage as American enterprises.  Once a foreign manufactured good is im ported into Canada and duty is paid, the  goods become nationalized and are re garded from that time-forward as Cana dian manufactured goods for Customs  purposes.  At a  time when unemployment is un acceptably high, when we are losing too  much business and  too many  jobs  foreign competition, we can by enacting  this measure help to insure that Ameri ca's aircraft engine overhaul and repair  industry remains vital and competitive  and continues  to provide employment  oppOrtunities  for our people. Airwork  service division of Purex Corp., which  is engaged in the aircraft engine over haul and repair business, alone employs  over 600 people in my State, New Jersey.  The enactment of this bill will allow the  aircraft engine overhaul and repair in dustry, now adversely affected by our  tariff regulations,  to adjust  to  foreign  competition.  Based on current operation of the air craft engine overhaul and repair busi ness,  the annual customs revenue  loss  resulting  from enactment of  this bill  would be approximately $2.5 million, a  modest amount.  When the present customs regulations  were originally drafted,  the now com mon-place type of transactions il'lvolv loaner engines were not contem plated. Had they been, I  am confident  the exemption sought today would have  been included in those regulations.  A viable U.S. aircraft engine overhaul  and repair industry able to compete in  the world market would obviously help  improve the balance of payments situa tion of our country. Enactment of this  measure will promote competitive oppor tunities  for U.S.  business  in  foreign  markets and promote economic growth  and employment in the United States.  At a time when we urgently need to ex pand  investment and employment op portunities for our people and promote  export development, we should enact this  measure which will assist us greatly in  achieving these goals.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered  to be printed  in  the REcoRD,  as follows:  ing  s. 814  it enacted. by  the Senate and. House  Be  of Representatives of the United States of  America  in Congress assembled, That sub part A of part I of schedule 8 of the Tariff  Schedules of  the United States  (19 U.S.C.  1202)  is amended by inserting immediately  after item 801.10 the following new item:  ",1977
101,Senate,95,0.495,301,5,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, on behalf  of myself and my colleague from Utah,  Mr. HATCH, I offer an amendment to S.  11, a bill to provide for the appointment  of additional district court judges. This  amendment will provide that the Presi dent shall appoint, by and with the ad vice and consent of the Senate, one addi tional district  judge for  the district of  Utah. There are currently two Federal  district court judges serving that district.  Most of us are aware of the growing  burden being placed upon the Federal  judiciary. This burden is attributable to  many causes, but certainly the number  and nature of the legislation passed by  Congress is one of the most important  factors  in  increasing  litigation.  The  Speedy Trial Act  is perhaps  the best  example of  legislation which places a  severe burden on the Federal courts, and  it is a piece of legislation which has re cently been referred to by Chief Justice  Burger as he has pled for additional dis trict judgeships and new judgeships in  the courts of appeals. Some of the Chief  Justice's remarks were  inserted in the  RECORD on January 10, 1977, by Senator  McCLELLAN when he  introduced S. 11,  and I will not again refer to those re marks from Mr. Burger's year-end re port. Instead, I will cite one paragraph  from the Chief Justice's 1977 report to  the American Bar Association, delivered  in Seattle, Wash., February 13, 1977. The  Chief Justice said:  ... The Congress has taken no action on  the obvious need  for  sixty-five additional  judgeships badly needed for  five years. All  this time the growth of new filings has con tinued, and  it  is now  imperative  that we  have, not sixty-five new judgeships, but ap proximately  one hundred  thirty-two--one  hundred  seven  district  judgeships  and  twenty-five circuit judgeships. I am hopeful  now, with the election behind us, there will  be no further delay in the creation of these  desperately needed judgeships.  Let me also remind this body that the  Chief Justice urges us to consider ""judi cial impact statements."" We must do a  better job of predicting the consequences  of legislation on the workload of the ju diciary. I believe, in some instances, this  Congress and American society place too  great a reliance on the judicial machin ery, and I hope that that trend can be  reversed in some areas. At the same time,  we must see the facts as they are and  realize that the legislation which passes  this Congress each year depends in large  measure on the courts for  its enforce ment.  On April 1, 1976, the Senate passed S.  287, which would have created 45 new  district court  judgeships. The bill was  referred  to  the House Judiciary Com mittee, which reported the bill, with an  amendment, on September 28, 1976. The  House committee recommended 49 new  district court judgeships.  The Senate committee established four  criteria by which to judge the need for  additional district judgeship.s. Districts  which ""met all or most"" of the criteria  were judged in need of one or more ad ditional  judgeships. Those criteria are  listed on page 13 of the Senate report  <No. 94-387) as follows:  (1) Either raw or weighted case filings are  400 or more per judge; and (2)  terminations  are in excess of the national average of 358  per judge; and (3)  the bench time averages  110 or more days per judge; and (4)  the dis trict has made efficient use of existing judges,  supporting personnel, and procedural devices  in order to cope with its existing workload.  The committee applied the criteria ob jectively except for certain large metro politan districts. The Court allowed ad ditional  judgeships in  these  large dis tricts without the necessity of meeting  the above criteria.  The House committee-House report  No. 94-1705-felt strongly that the Sen ate's report was an ""enormous contribu tion  to congressional understanding of  Federal  court manpower  problems.""  However, the House committee did not  strictly adhere to the Senate formula be cause it felt that the Senate formula did  not necessarily produce the correct result  in every district in which it was applied.  The House report correctly points out  that the Senate did not strictly follow  the four criteria either. Therefore, both  committees used the criteria as a useful  starting point for analysis. In the words  of the House report:  ... like the Senate, the House Committee  did not itself apply the formula strictly to  each district. Rather,  in some cases it was  necessary to reach behind the screen of sta tistics to find a  true picture o! tl1e needs o!  a particular district.  In the case of the U.S. District Court  for  the District of Utah,  the statistics  show 346 filings per judge during f'.LScal  year 1976. This compares with the stand ard set by the committee of 400 filings  per judge. During fiscal year 1976,  the  Utah district showed 348  terminations  per judge and this number is just shy of  the committee figure of 358. For the third  criterion of bench time, the Utah district  had 149 days per judge, which is about  35 percent higher than the committee  threshold of 110 days per judge.  The  fourth  committee criterion  re quires  efficient use of existing  judges,  supporting personnel, and procedural de vices in order to cope with the existing  workload. This criterion is subjective and  facts cannot be put alongside it which  yield  a  ready  comparison. There are  serious problems with the administration  of the District of Utah. Perhaps the best  statement on the Utah court situation  was given by  the Honorable David T.  Lewis, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the lOth Circuit, on May 18,  1976, when Judge Lewis testified in sup port of S. 1130. The judge's statement  clearly shows that the Utah court has  administrative problems. Progress can be  made-there is no doubt about that but the Utah court is  in a unique di lemma. Our administrative problems are  due, in large part, to the very fact that  we have a  two-judge district court and  that the chief judge continues to serve  as such although he is well beyond age  70.  This  predicament  is  attributable  to  a  ""grandfather clause"" of  a  1958  statute which provides an exception from  the general rule for  two-judge district  courts. The general rule  is, of course,  that all  judges must  relinquish  their  chief judgeship at age 70.  The Utah situation is unique. We be lieve this amendment is justified because  the Utah court has a workload level suf ficient  to meet two of the three objective criteria of the Senate committee and  because the appointment of a third judge  would alleviate the serious administra tive problems posed by the ""grandfather  cia use"" and the  irascible  temperament  of the chief judge.  I will not  include Judge Lewis's full  statement here, but I will see that the  Judiciary Committee has it brought to  their attention.  I may say, Mr. President, that although  I have not communicated with Utah's  present chief judge, Willis W. Ritter, on  this particular issue, it is believed that  Judge Ritter favors the appointment of  a  third judge. In a letter to the Honor able Quentin N. Burdick  from  Judge  Ritter dated May 14, 1976, and printed  in pages 204-206 of the hearing record on  S. 1130, Judge Ritter states:  ... creating a  third district court judge  for the district of Utah [is J a problem which  does need long overdue congressional atten tion.  In the same letter, Judge Ritter calls  the third-judge idea something that will  prove ""constructive and of lasting bene fit"" for Utah. Judge Ritter's  letter was  written in opposition  to my attempt to  have him adhere to the same laws apply ing to other chief judges, but I am happy  to see that we can agree on the need for  a third judge in Utah.  There will undoubtedly be some ques tion as to the workload of the Utah court  and its need for an additional judge. 1  have cited the statistics which demon strate such need, but let me bolster those  statistics with some comparisons. The  Utah court exceeds by about 35 percent  the  third committee criterion,  that  is  bench time per judge. This needs to be  emphasized because the following com parisons will deal only with total filings  and  total  terminations which  are  the  first  two criteria of  the Senat-e com mittee.  Recently, the Director of the Adminis trative Office of the U.S. Courts trans mitted to Congress the volume ""Manage ment Statistics for U.S. Courts, 1976.""  This very helpful document sets out rele vant facts for the courts of appeals and  district courts of the United States. The  U.S. District Court for Utah is shown as  69th among all U.S. district courts in the  number of total filings per  judge and  62d among all U.S. district courts for to tal terminations per judge. The Utah dis trict was not recommended to receive a  third  judge, however  several districts  with  lower standings  received  recom mendations for additional judgeships.  For example, the District Court for the  District of N orthem Indiana stands 71st  and 63d in the standings; the Washing ton Eastern District stands 74th and 75th  in the standings; the District for East ern Oklahoma stands 84th and 81st in  the standings. Each of these districts has  been recommended to receive one addi tional district judge and  those recom mendations are now pending before the  Judiciary Committee in amendment No.  40  to S. 11. Amendment No. 40 was in troduced by Senator McCLELLAN on Feb ruary 10, 1977, and contains the recom mendations of the Judicial Conference  of the United States.  There are other districts  that rank  below Utah but have also received recom",1977

103,House,95,-0.468,366,5,Mr. LEGGETT.," I might state in fur ther reply  to  the gentleman  that  the  States today are, as a practical matter,  the prime enforcers of the fish and game  laws that we have. They are exercising  authority under the Constitution, virtu ally exactly as the FBI and the other  agencies do, although hopefully they are  not abusing  it. The authority here  is  merely to conform the authority for a  Federal agency  to  the authority most  States have given the State enforcement  agencies, and have been given to the Fed eral enforcement agencies.

104,House,95,-0.457,366,5,Mr. RONCALIO.," Mr. Speaker, I was  very interested in the dialog between the  gentleman from Kentucky and the chair man of the subcommittee. In Wyoming,  a great hunting State, we had an exam ple many years ago which fell into the  gray area of this constitutional question.  In our example, the late, great Judge  nsley of Newcastle, Wyo., was driving  through an, antelope checkpoint on a  highway in the Newcastle area. He did  not have his pickup truck and did not  have a gun, for he was going from one  county courthouse to another 70 miles  away. An overly ambitious game warden  stopped his car and said, ""Let me look in  your trunk.""  The  judge  warrant?""  The warden said, ''No. I do not need  one. This is hunting season.""  The judge said, ""Young man, if you  restrain my liberties here today, you may  be before a court of law tomorrow.""  have  said,  ""Do  you  Finally,  the warden understood. He  said, ""Yes. I guess you can drive on with out my searching your car.""  So there will be always a gray area.  If one is in a hunting vehicle, has wea pons,  and  the warden  asks  look  through the car. I believe he has a right  to do that without a warrant--on an other subject.  to  I hope those officials administering the  Fish and Wildlife Act and the Migratory  Bird Act will restore the fishery at Sara toga, Wyo., and will move to bring about  a  better  stocking of  the  streams  in  Wyoming.  Some of my reservations about this  bill have been removed with the support  of my good friend, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. RUPPE).  ",1977
105,House,95,-0.564,366,5,Mr. WEISS.," Mr. Speaker, first let me  extend my appreciation to my colleague,  the gentleman  from New York  <Mr.  MURPHY) , for the work that his commit tee has done, and to indicate my trepida tion, really,  in getting up  to voice my  reservations  about  this  legislation  in  light of the work they have done.  ,  Mr. Speaker, I have two basic prob leiDS with the bill before us. One, there  is no report. I must say that as a new  Member, I do not have the background  that other Members may have about this  legislation,  which,  apparently,  was  adopted by the House last year, nor do I  have access to the report which was filed  last year.  It seems to me that we should have a  full report before us.  Second, I am not concerned about the  rights of hunters as hunters, but I am  concerned about the rights of American  citizens as American citizens. I am con cerned about the potential violation of  the fourth amendment provision of the  Constitution in those provisions of this  bill which authorize search and seizure  without a warrant.  Mr. Speaker, it seeiDS to me that the  better part of wisdom would be to lay  this bill aside or to recommit it until we  have had a full report that all of us could  study, to see what the facts are as to the  ramifications of this legislation.  Until such time, I really have no alter native except not to vote for this legtsla tion.  ",1977

This question with respect  to search  and seizure also concerns me. This con cern has been expressed by my distin guished colleague,  the gentleman from  Kentucky <Mr. CARTER) and others.  For example, if a paid informer should  state to a Federal or State officer that  a certain person had more than the limit  of fish which he was entitled to catch,  or had killed a doe in violation of the  law, and that it was  in his residence,  under this law would the officer or agent  have the right to go in and search that  party's house merely on that informa tion?

Ms. Fiorella is an associate professor  in the School of Associated Medical Sci ences at the University of illinois Medi cal Center in Chicago. She has served on  many committees at the school and the  college of medicine, and ha.s been an ac tive member of  the Missouri, Til., and  American Society of Medical Technology  since 1955. Ms. Fiorella has a bachelor of  science degree from Webster College in  Missouri, and a master of science degree  from Central Michigan University.  I would  like  to share with my col leagues the text of Ms. Fiorella's January  28 statement:  STATEMENT BY BEVERLY J. FIORELLA  A  new  and  independent  certification  agency has been established which wlll be  responsible for certifying laboratory person nel  in  the United States. Its name  is  the  National Certification Agency  for Medical  Laboratory Personnel.  The American Society for Medical Tech nology, which represents more  than 28,000  laboratory administrators, supervisors, edu cators,  technologists,  technicians and spe cialists, endorses this new agency and sup ports its objectives. For over 20 years ASl\IT  has been  actively  involved  in developing  standards of certification and accreditation  for clinical laboratory professionals. We have  participated with various organizations  in  these  endeavors,  including  the American  Medical Association, the National Accrediting  Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences, the  American Society of Clinical Pathologists,  and the United States Office of Education.  I cite these organizations and the years of  our  involvement  to demonstrate  the deep  commitment of ASMT to the highest stand ards  of  professionalism,  competence  and  quality patient services.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  For many years we have encouraged the  establishment of an  independent and au tonomous certifying body !or c.inical lab;_.ra ~ory profes:;ionals which would be  free of  control by any siugle professional organiza tlOn.  There is a clear and compelling reason why  certification by an  independent agency 1s  needed. An ln<iependent certification agency,  under the direction of individuals represeut iug a broad spectrum of !.llterests, and having  as  their pnmary  concern  the quality  of  laboratory  services,  is  the most  effective  manner in which to assure professional com petence. Independent certification is a pro gressive  step  towards  the profession's ac ceptance  of  its  responsibll1ty  to  provide  optimum patient services.  In  the  44  years  since  the ASMT was  founded, great advances have been made in  the preparation and continuing education  of  laboratory  personnel,  particularly  as  sophisticated  technology entered  the  field.  Our profession,  in  a  very  real  sense, has  become  a  highly  skllied  discipline. The  knowledge  and  scientific  capab111ties  re quired  of  our  people  demand  extensive  training and education. We have reached a  new level of recognition and standlllg 1.11 the  medical  community. An mdependent cer tification agency, by and for medical labora tory personnel can be more responsive to the  growth of the profession.  There are also other circumstances which  favor such a step. The Federal Trade Com mission has made known  its  intention  to  initiate a major program of ""inquiry  into  various  competitive  problems  in  the de livery of health care services."" A major area  of concern is the vested interest of profes sional organizations in certification activities  which may be considered a conflict of inter est. The ASCP Board of Registry is a poten tial target of such scrutiny.  While  the ASMT  took  the  initiative  to  help  establish  the National Certification  Agency, I want to assure you that we con sider the independence and autonomy of this  agency  of  paramount  importance.  Even  though, for an interim period, the agency wm  be located in the same building as the ASMT  Headquarters  in Houston,  I want  to em phasize that their offices and personnel are  entirely separate from the ASMT offices.  The National Certification Agency  is for tunate to have three exceptionally talented  and dedicated officers who wiD  serve  the  agency during the initial period of organiza tion. They are Sara Marie Cicarel11, presi dent; VernaL. Rausch, secretary and Anna marie Barros,  treasurer. All  three have ex cellent credentials and are highly respected  in  the medical  laboratory  field.  Inquiries  concerning  the new agency and  its plans  should be directed to its president.  It  is our strongest desire  that  the Na tional Certification Agency maintains  its  independence  and  achieves  its  obiectives.  We hope that all groups now certifying in  the laboratory field wlll participate. A strong  and independent certlflcatlon agency is the  greatest assurance  to  the medical profes sion and to the public that the high quality  of service provided by laboratory personnel  will be maintained.  NEIGHBORHOOD GOVERNMENT  ACT  HON. RICHARD A. GEPHARDT  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 28, 1977  ",1977
109,,95,-0.416,392,5,Mr. GEPHARDT.," Mr. Speaker, I am  today introducing the second in a series  February 28, 1977  of bills designed to promote conservation  of our older neighborhoods.  Since World War II our Nation's cities  have experienced a steady outmigration  of both people and jobs, leading to deteri oration of their tax bases and a subse quent decline  in the quality of urban  life.  To a  large extent, this condition ha.s  grown out of Federal policies which have  created tax incentives for new home con struction, financed highways for easy ac cess  to the suburbs, encouraged home buying outside the city, and so on.  Our  older  neighborhoods,  however,  have many  assets worth  preserving.  Their buildings provide valuable residen tial and business space  in addition  to  serving  social  functions  through  churches, schools, and other institutions.  Some of the buildings in our older neigh borhoods have historical significance and  some are simply fine old buildings worth  preserving for their own sake and for the  sake of future generations. In addition,  living in older neighborhoods helps pro tect the environment and save energy.  Their location near jobs and recreation  afford opportunities for protecting the  environment and saving energy.  Fortunately, the past decade or so has  marked a period of renewed interest in  urban living. Today many people seek  out older homes because of their substan tial construction, interesting design, and  often lower price. More and more subur banites are now moving to older neigh borhoods because  they  provide  relief  from commuting and easier access  to  entertainment and recreation.  It is this change in attitude by a grow ing portion of our population that offers  the best hope for the future of our cities.  It should be Government's role to en courage the new trend and protect the  Nation from loss of its valuable cities.  To this end, on February 9 I  intro duced  the National Neighborhood Pol icy Act which would establish a Com mission on Neighborhoods to undertake  a comprehensive investigation of the fac tors contributing to the decline of our  city neighborhoods and  to  recommend  changes in Federal, State and local laws  and programs to promote neighborhood  conservation. This bill has already been  approved by the Housing Subcommittee.  The bill I am introducing today would  encourage perhaps the strongest catalyst  of our cities' resurgence-the voluntary  efforts of urban citizens.  The proposed Neighborhood Govern ment Act  offers Federal  income  tax  credits to individuals for contributions  to  community  corporations  delivering  services to their neighborhoods.  The bill encourages communities and  neighborhoods  incorporate  for  this  purpose and to seek certification by the  Internal Revenue Service.  The amount of  tax credits for con tributions to neighborhood corporations  would be on a sliding scale according to  income, with  the highest proportion percent-going  to  those  taxpayers  earning $10,000 or less. Full credit would  be allowed to residents of the neighbor hood served by the corporation.  Many of us from urban districts have  probably seen already the splendid work  so  to  ",1977
110,,95,0.32,405,5,Mr. SPENCE.," Mr. Speaker, there has  been substantial di!.cussion and debate  throughout the Federal Government con cerning nuclear proliferation. Numerous  bills have been introduced in the Senate  and the House of Representatives to im pose  tight controls on  the  transfer of  nuclear materials and fuel. Recent state ments by President Carter and congres sional leader.s reflect a strong desire to  control nuclear proliferation, and there  is currently an  interagency evaluation  underway  to  establish  administration  policy on this controversial subject.  Because of the location of a nuclear  fuel reprocessing facility in my district,  at Barnwell, S.C., the issue has been of  special interest to me and to many of my  constituents. It is a highly complex sub ject, and one which requires for most  of us a great deal of technical assistance  from the experts. A recent paper by Dr.  L. J. Colby, Jr., of Allied Chemical Corp.,  entitled ""Nuclear Fuel Cycle, Reprocess ing and Proliferation,"" has been espe cially helpful along these lines.  Dr. Colby's paper, which was prepared  tor a congressional briefing, describes the  nuclear fuel cycle,  the reprocessing of  spent reactor fuel, and how these activi ties worldwide must be controlled to fur ther nonproliferation goals. I believe that  my colleagues will find this material to  be both educational and thought provok ing, and I  insert Dr. Colby's paper at  this point in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:  THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE  ),  (UF6 Uranium ore is mined domestically in tbe  western United States. Canada, France, and  South Africa are other principal free world  producers, and Australia. has  large proven  reserves that are expected to come into pro duction  in  the near  future. Uranium ore,  which contains approximately 0.25 percent  ura.nium, is shipped from the mines to near by mills, where  the uranium  is extracted.  The product of  the milling operation  1s  called ""yellow cake."" Becauo;e natural ura nium contains only about 0.7 percent U-235  (the remainder being U-238), it must be en riched prior to use in nuclear reactors. The  yellow cake  is  shipped  from  the mill  for  sampling, conversion to uranium hexafluor ide  and  further  purification. The  UF6  is then shipped in cycltnders to ERDA  gaseous difusion plants  for enrichment, a  step in which the concentration of U-235 is  increa.<.>ed  from 0.7 percent  to 3.0 percent.  There are currently three uranium enrich ment plants in the United States, all of which  use  gaseous  diffusion  technology.  These  plants are located at Oak Ridge, Tennessee;  Paducah, Kentucky; and Portsmouth, Ohio.  The final form of uranium in Light Water  Re3.ctor  (LWR)  fuel  is  uranium  dioxide  (U02), a solid. The UF6 gas in converted into  powered U02,  and subsequently pellets. In  an LWR pellets are inserted into zirconium  tubes. A fuel assembly is made up of a bundle  of these tubes numbering from 50 to 300, de pending on reactor core design. A  typical  reactor contains over 100 such fuel assem blies which may represent an investment of  $30 million.  During operation of an LWR,  the U-235  fissions creating heat that produces steam  for power generation. As a result of this fis sion  process,  radioactive  by-products  are  formed.  Each  fission  produces  neutrons.  Some of these cause fission of another U-235  nucleus, other neutrons may be captured by  a U-238 nucleus to produce plutonium, which  in turn can also fission and contribute to the  production of heat energy. Plutonium fission  accounts  for about one  third of  the heat  generated during the design life of LWR fuel,  even though the original fuel is 100 percent  uo.,.  Gradually over the usable life of the fuel,  the U-235 content is depleted and the plu tonium content builds up. When the radio active  fission by-products reach a  concen tration where  they are absorbing so many  neutrons  that  the  fission  process can no  longer sustain itself, which can occur after 1  to 4 years of use, the highly radio-active fuel  elements are removed and placed in a. stor age pool at the reactor for decay cooling.  Sustained operation of LWR power plants  requires that spent fuel elements discharged  from the reactors be removed from the spent  fuel storage pools at the reactor sites on an  appropriate schedule. There are two alterna tives for disposition of spent fuel:  the spent  fuel may be transported to a chemical reproc essing plant by rail or truck in specially de signed casks for reprocessing to recover the  contained uranium and plutonium-either of  which m.a.y be recycled or may be stored for  ultimate alternative use. The separated radio active wastes would be cooled, solidified. and  packaged for terminal storage. Related. radio active  fuel  assembly cladding and general  process trash would be disposed of in accord ance with  regulations. Or,  the spent  fuel  elements may, after cooling in a storage pool,  be packaged and placed in perpetual storage  as waste (the ""throw-away"" option).  At  the  reprocessing plant,  the uranium  and plutonium products in the fuel element  would  be  chemically  separated  from  the  fission products and recovered. The uranium  would be  then reconverted to UF6 and the  process of enrichment, conversion and fabri cation is repeated. The recovered plutonium  would be converted to solid form for future  use in LWR recycle and/or the breeder reac tor. Fission products would be converted to  solids, stored at the plant site for additional  cooling, and then shipped to a federal waste  repository.  DESCRIPTION OF A NUCLEAR FUEL REPROCESSING  FACILITY  After about a  180-day cooling period at  the reactor, the spent fuel will be transported  to a  reprocessing facility  in a  specially de signed shipping container capable of provid ing shielding for the radioactive fission prod ucts and cooling of the residual heat in the  ~pent fuel. The sp~nt fuel will be stored in  a  spent  fuel pool until  reprocessing  com mences.  The spent fuel elements are next sheared  by an oscillating blade into segments 2 to 5  inches long. This chopping operation exposes  the soluble oxide fuel  inside  the  insoluble  zirconium cladding. The chopped fuel next  drops into a di~olver where the oxide is dis solved from the cladding by hot nitric acid  solution. After analysis of  the nitric acid  solution, the bulk of fission products are re moved  and  the  uranium  and  plutonium  streams are separated by electrolytic parti tioning and purified. This is accomplished by  adjusting  the  chemical properties of  the  plutonium electrochemically. The plutonium  is ""stripped"" into an aqueous liquid, and the  uranium moves  forward with  an  organic  liquid, resulting in the separation or ""parti tioning"" of plutonium and uranium. The  uranium is then stripped from the organic  liquid, concentrated by evaporation and puri fied. The three main liquid product streams  from  the Separations plant are: uranium,  nitrate, plutonium nitrate, and liquid waste  containing  the  highly  radioactive  fission  products.  These liquid streams require further proc essing at the reprocessing site as follows:  Uranium Conversion: The uranium nitrate  stream  is converted  into gaseous uranium  hexafiuoride (UF6)  for shipment to a govern ment-owned uranium enrichment plant.  Plutonium Conversion: In June, 1974, the  A toinic Energy Commission announced that  commercial shipments of  liquid plutonium  nitrate would be banned effective June, 1978.  While the basic chemical process of convert ing liquid plutonium nitrate to solid oxide  form  is well known, current regulatory un certainties over  conversion  facUlty  design  and safeguards and solids form acceptable  for storage and transportation have precluded  moving ahead  to design a plutonium con version !acUity.  Waste Handling: The liquid waste stream  from the Separations plant is stored in cooled  tanks. In 1971 the AEC adopted a regulation  that  permitted  highly  radioactive  liquid  waste storage at the reprocessing plant for  no more  than  five  years, after which  the  waste is to be solidified, stored as a solid for  permanent  disposal.  Lack  of  government  regulatory definitions and product criteria  have precluded moving ahead on design ef forts on facilities and equipment for waste  solidification.  STATUS OF NUCLEAR FUEL REPROCESSING IN THE  UNITED STATES  Nuclear Fuel Services-NFS  On September 23,  1976, NFS announced  that it was withdrawing from the reprocess ing business since it would be uneconomical  and perhaps  impossible  to meet  the new  seismic criteria.

111,House,95,-0.366,444,5,Mr. VANIK.," Mr. Speaker, I am today  introducing legislation to amend the So cial Security Act  to provide for direct  coverage of clinical social work services  rendered to medicare and medicaid pa tients. Similar legislation has been in troduced in the other Chamber by the  senior  Senator  from  Hawaii  <Mr.  INOUYE).  Clinical social workers-also known  as psychiatric social workers--have long  been working along with psychiatrists  and  psychologists  to  provide mental  health services to the American public.  However, because most clinical  social  workers do not hold medical degrees,  their services have not been covered un der the medicare/medicaid program ex cept in limited instances where the pa tient is under the continuing supervision  of a physician. Often such supervision is  not clinically required, and the require ment for supervision adds a significant though  unnecessary-additional  element of cost to the patient and the pro gram.  We are  all painfully aware of  the  astounding  increase  in  the  cost  of  health care over the past few years. Ol,le  effective way to reduce cost increases is  to encourage patients to seek treatment  from alternative, nonphysician provid ers such as clinical social workers.  During the past 2 years, as part of  my work on the Ways and Means Over sight Subcommittee,  I  have made an  extensive study of the end-stage renal  disease program. This program, created  by the 1972 Social Security amendments,  basically provides medicare coverage, re gardless  of  age,  for  individuals with  chronic kidney disease. We have found  that the cost of ESRD treatment at home  is approximately one-third the cost of  treatment  in a kidney dialysis facility  and one-fourth the cost of treatment at  a hospital. Therefore, if more patients  could be encouraged to undertake dialy sis at home with  the aid of a  family  member, the medicare trust funds could  save enormous amounts of money-pos sibly as much at $14,000 to $24,000 per  patient per year. Unfortunately,  self dialysis with the aid of a family member  can be very difficult emotionally. The  patient is dependent on a machine and  on  the help of a  relative. The family  members may be frightened by the proc ess, by the flow of blood through a ma chine, by  the  fear of  failure of  the  machine or of a mistake on the part of  the helper, and so forth. It appears that  a  large number of patients who could  dialyze at home do not because of emo tional and psychological reasons. If the  help of clinical social workers were avail able, I believe that a number of  these  fears and problems could be overcome  and  the patient and his family could  come  to undertake home dialysis and  home care in a calm and rational man ner. On February 3, the chairman of the  Ways and Means Health Subcommittee,  Mr. ROSTENKOWSKI,  and  I  introduced  legislation  to  improve  the  end-stage  renal disease program. Among the pro visions in our bill <H.R. 3112), we  in cluded medicare coverage of supportive  services for patients attempting dialysis  at home. The language in H.R. 3112  is  intended to provide for psychological and  social worker assistance to chronic kid ney disease patients.  I believe that there are numerous other  areas where the use of professional social  workers could provide the type of assist ance necessary to maintain health and  overcome  illness at the lowest possible  cost. But at the present time, a medicare  or medicaid patient who needs mental  health services can obtain  reimburse ment only if the services are rendered by  a physician or, in some States, by a clini cal social worker working under the di rect supervision of a physician. Whatever  validity such a  restrictive policy might  once have enjoyed, it is an anachronism  today in view of the following facts:  clinical social worker who earns a  masters or doctoral degree in social work  and subsequently performs 3000 hours of  supervised clinical practice  is far betA  ter trained to do psychotherapy than a  general medical school graduate who has  not specialized in psychiatry;  Clinical social workers are far more  numerous  than psychiatrists, and are  more evenly distributed geographically  than psychiatrists, who tend to be clus tered in the major urban centers; and  The average hourly fee of clinical so cial workers is fully a third less than that  of psychiatrists, according to Ralph Na der's Health Research Group.  The bill I have introduced today would  provide direct coverage for clinical so cial work services rendered to medicare  and medicaid  patients,  regardless  of  whether the services are rendered in a  hospital outpatient setting, a community  mental health  center, a  neighborhood  health center, or by a clinical social work er in independent practice.  Medicare and medicaid coverage deci sions should be based on  the kinds of  services provided, and not on the title  of  the provider. If the diagnosis and  treatment of mental health problems is to  be a covered service, then reimbursement  should not be dependent on the title of  the provider.  The clinical social work profession has  earned the right to be able to serve medi care and medicaid patients. Its members  are presently licensed or certified in 20  States around the country. Its two major  professional associations-the National  Federation of Societies for Clinical Social  Work and the National Association of So cial Work-are vigorously pressing  for  the enactment of  licensing laws in the  remaining States. Both the National Fed eration and NASW have sponsored a na tional registry in which consumers can  find the names of the most highly quali fied members of the profession in their  communities. Both organizations are ac tively  involved in establishing and im plementing uniform nrofessional stand ards, and peer review to insure quality  control. I believe that the bill I have in troduced requires sufficient training  to  insure that only qualified and competent  social workers would be eligible for re imbursement under  the program. The  various mechanisms currently  in place  to guard against improper utilization of  services and unreasonable charges would  be extended to. prevent any abuse of this  provision.  Most important, the people who need  mental health services should be free to  select  the  therapist  of  their  choice,  whether a  clinical social worker or a  psychiatrist. They  should not be  re stricted by  the reimbursement mecha nism  to  the most expensive and  least  widely available mode of service. It is  my firm hope and belief that by includ ing nonphysician mental health pro viders in medicare and medicaid, we can  make it possible for more people to get  the help they need at lower cost to the  Federal Government. I will be inviting  my colleagues to join with me in sup porting this legislation and in pressing  for its prompt consideration and enact ment  into present  law and  into any  future national health program.  The text of the bill follows:  ",1977

113,Senate,95,-0.408,535,5,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, I am happy  to join again with my distinguished col league  from  South Dakota,  Senator  ABouREZK,  in cosponsoring  the Family  Farm Antitrust Act. This bill would limit  family farm takeover and farming opera tions by concentrated economic interests  which are substantially nonfarm in na ture.  Recent hearings have brought to light  new evidence of the serious conti.'luing  threat  to  the American  family  farm.  Testimony and news coverage has re vealed that Continental illinois National  Bank & Trust Co. had planned to use a  $50 million tax-free trust fund for farm  land  investment. This  is one more in stance of  the contiiming  intrusion of  concentrated economic power into farm  life.  According  to  the National Farmers  Union, there is enough money in private  pension and profit-sharing trust funds to  buy up one-fourth of the Nation's farms  if schemes like  the Continental Bank's  are allowed to proliferate.  The  unparalleled  productivity  of  American agriculture rests on the effi ciency of the mechanized family farm.  Despite this efficiency which has made  the American family farm the most pro ductive agricultural unit in  the world,  the spiraling cost of farm land over the  past several years presents a  threat to  the very existence of our family farms.  Rapidly rising farm land costs threaten  our entire farm and food economy. In deed, it is a crisis of national propor tions.  The average acre of farmland in my  home State of Indiana has increased a  whopping 30 percent  in the  last year   alone and has doubled in value over the  last 5 years.  Nationally, farmland increased 17 per cent in 1976 and there is every indica tion that this trend will continue. The  USDA projects  that  the average acre  will increase an additional 9 percent this  year.  Under these conditions it is extremely  difficult for young farm families to get  a start. According to the USDA while it  took $10,000  to begin farming in 1940,  today it costs about a quarter of a mil lion dollars to start a modest commercial  farm.  There  is no doubt that big bank or  corporate buy-up plans like the Conti nental Bank's would increase the pres sures on rising  land prices and reduce  even further opportunities for individual  farm ownership.  This situation  raises  the specter of  farmland prices and startup capital re quirements reaching such high levels in  the very near future  that new farmers  will be frozen out. Even established fam ily farmers may be squeezed out as farm land becomes concentrated in the hands  of huge financial  institutions. We sim ply must not allow that to happen.  Making it even worse, the taxes on in come from funds such as the Continental  Bank's would be deferred to the future,  which would give these trusts an unfair  advantage in making further purchases.  This tax break is not available to  indi vidual farmers.  Another effect of the use of such multi million dollar  trust  funds  as well  as  limited partnerships and nonfarm cor porate arrangements  to buy up farm land will be an  increase  in absentee  ownership. Farm tenancy has been re duced nationally from 42 percent in 1935  to 11 percent in 1974. These corporate  and big bank buy-up plans would reverse  this trend. What a  tragedy it would be  for us to stand by and watch young farm ers becoming tenants and sharecroppers  on land which their parents and grand parents owned and farmed.  As one who grew up on a family farm  and a  farmer myself far a number of  years, I have always been concerned with  the preservation of the family farm. It  was this concern which led me to in tro duce the Family Farm Inheritance Act  in past years and to join in other legis lation in support of a national policy to  preserve our family farms.  . While I am concerned about the Conti nental Bank's proposed Ag-Land Fund,  this  incident admittedly was not very  broad in its initial scope. The problem is  that it mav set a precedent for future  financial endeavors of the same type. In trusion by huge corporations into farm  life has already gone  too far. For ex ample, Tenneco, a major conglomerate,  has acquired tens of thousands of acres  of farmland along with its agribusiness  investments.

114,,95,-0.165,626,5,Mr. FITHIAN.," Mr. Speaker,  in  the  last 20 years it has become increasingly  evident  that  reform of  the  electoral  college  is needed. The direct popular  election of the President is  long over due.  In  and  third  party candidates  threatened  to  throw  the election into the House of Repre sentatives.  In supporting Senate Joint Resolu tion 1, Prof. Kenneth Kofmehl, a dis tinguished scholar of political  science  at Purdue University, recently testified  before the Senate Judiciary Sub'commit tee on Constitutional Amendments. For  the benefit of my colleagues, I  request  that  Professor  Kofmehl's  thought provoking testimony be reprinted in the  RECORD. It is as follows:  STATEMENT OF KENNETH KOFMEHL, PROFESSOR  OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, PuRDUE UNIVERSITY  It is indeed a privilege to participate in  your hearings on presidential election reform.  This undertaking,  in my opinion,  is even  more important now than previously because  the consequences of a misfire in the electoral  college could be more damaging now than  in  times past and because  there appears  to be less widespread public concern about  this danger than in 1969-70 when Congress  last dealt with the problem.  In recent years, the resignations of a Vice  President and President in disgrace, other  revelations of corruption in high office, and  growing public  frustration with apparent  unresponsiveness of government have  se riously shaken  faith  in our public  insti tutions. As many have observed, a shift of  less than 3,687 popular votes in Hawaii and  5,559 in Ohio would have given a majority  of the electoral votes to Gerald Ford, who  had 1.7 million  fewer popular votes  than  Jimmy Carter. Had this occurred--especially  as a  result of a  ""deliberate shopping !or  electoral votes"" which was at  least con templated according to testimony by Sena tor Dole before this Subcommittee ten days  ago--the legitimacy of our political system  could  very  well  have  been  irreparably  damaged.  Despite this close call, the third such since  1960 caused in part by the efforts of minor  party candidates to exploit the potentialities  for mischief in the electoral college system,  the general public does not seem nearly as  aroused about the danger as eight years ago.  To some extent this may have resulted from  di.trerential perceptions of the threat in 1968  and in 1976. The possib111ty that George Wal lace might throw the election into the House  of Representatives or even determine which  major party candidate won in 1968 stimu lated a much greater outpouring of books,  articles, and commentary in the mass media  than  the  likelihood  that Gene McCarthy  might help deny election to the winner of  the popular vote in 1976. More importantly,  part of  this  indi.fference may derive from  vigorous efforts made since 1969 to impugn  direct popular election of the President, the  only alternative to the present system that  would ensure victory  to  the popular vote  winner.  There are numerous fallacies in the prin cipal arguments advanced by participants  in this endeavor. Frequently they have in dulged in transparent projection, attribut ing defects of the electoral college system to  the direct popular election process. An ex cellent example of this is their contention  that direct election would encourage voting  fraud and necessitate  time-consuming and  costly recounts. Quite the contrary, the temp tation and  likelihood of success for such  fraud  is much greater under  the present  system where stealing but a  few thousand  votes in a state or two could suffice to throw  a large enough bloc of electoral votes to de termine the outcome. For instance, in 1976,  it would have been much easier to record  fraudulently  less  than ten thousand votes  in Hawaii and Ohio  than  to steal  the 1.7  million votes necessary to reverse  the na tionwide popular verdict. Under direct pop ular election, votes would still be tabulated  and reported on a state-by-state basis. Hence,  any accusations of fraudulent behavior  particular counties could just as readily be  checked by localized recounts as now.  An even more  flagrant example of such  projection is their argument that the elec toral college is a bulwark of our two-party  system and that instituting a direct popular  vote for President would encourage its dis integration. Examination of presidential elec tions since World War ll indicates that is  not true. Starting with the splinter parties of  Strom Thurmond and Henry Wallace in the  1948 compaign and continuing with slates of  unpledged electors in 1960, George Wallace's  party in 1968, and Gene McCarthy's inde pendent presidential candidacy in 1976, there  has been a  succession of serious efforts to  throw the election into the House or to cause  the outcome of  the major party contests  to be different  than they otherwise would  have been. The electoral college system in vites such fragmentation because a  ra;ther  small minor party  that  is  geographically  concentrated can harvest a significant num ber of electoral votes.  In 1948 with but 2.4 per cent of the pop ular vote, Strom Thurmond won 39  elec toral votes. A shift of less than 9,000 votes  in California and 17,000  in Dllnois would  have denied either major party candidate a  majority of the electoral votes. In 1968 with  13.5 per cent of the popular vote, George  Wallace garnered 46 electoral votes. I! there  in  ",1977
115,,95,0.342,652,5,Mr. DERWINSKI.," Mr. Speaker, it has  been clear over the years that the ma jority of Members in Congress feel that  the cause of education has not been  well served by the various court-ordered  busing plans.  In fact  the courts have managed  to  complicate  the  education  process  in  many city school districts rather than  to solve the segregation problem.  An article by Michael Kilian, the Chi cago Tribune's resident philosopher, ad dresses this subject in a most interest ing fashion in his column of February 22.  The article follows:  BUSING  PLANS CAN Go FAR-FROM  TO ALTOONA  POONA  IVORY TOWER, Mo.-The United States Civil  Plights Commission today urged  the adop tion of nationwide interstate busing as the  only practical means of reversing school seg regation in industrialized urban states.   ""When you compare all-black schools in St.  Louis with all-white schools  in Cheyenne,  Wyo., busing across state lines obviously is  the only answer,"" said Selwyn Dimly, com mission chairman.  Dimly spoke at a news conference called to  announce  the  release of  the commission's  3,000-page  report,  ""Desegregation:  Come  What May."" The news conference was held  at the commission's offices here, deep in the  thickly forested heights of Maryland's Catoc tin Mountains.  ""From where we sit,  it's perfectly clear,""  Dimly  said.  ""If you're going  to  integrate  schools, you have to mix up black kids and  white kids. Factors like time, distance, and  family structure become irrelevant.""  Dimly said the commission studied several  alternatives to interstate busing, but rejected  them as impractical.  ""Interstate jetting by commercial airliner  is  too expensive,"" he said. ""Interstate rail roading is out because Amtrak doesn't have  enough passenger trains to move people on  the scale we en vision.""  The chairman said  the commission had  decided to abandon its earlier position call ing for the busing of white and black chil dren between major cities and suburbs.  ""In  too many cases,  the whites  simply  moved to more outlying suburbs,"" he said.  ""I don't understand why all blacks and  whites can't live  together  in perfect har mony,"" he said. ""After all, it's called for in  our commission guidelines.""  Dimly said that the commission is study ing other measures for possible use if inter state busing does not  prove  satisfactory.  These include :  Destruction of all expressways,  interstate  highways, and commuter  lines as a means  of stemming the suburban exodus.  ",1977
116,House,95,-0.218,730,5,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker, it was on  this  date, March  2,  in  1836,  that a  courageous band of new Texans, many  freshly  arrived  from Kentucky, Ten nessee, Georgia Alabama, and eslewhere,  declared  themselves  an  independent  republic. This historic deed occurred at  Washington on  the Brazos which  is a  vital and historic part of my lOth Con gressional District.  Some 141 years later this  is still an  occasion which Texans, and especially  ex-students of the University of Texas,  celebrate in all corners of the globe.  Today, not only to celebrate the still  independent spirit of Texans but to also  demonstrate  the  influence  and  our  friendly  relations with  our  neighbor  Mexico,  I  am serving venison-chili  in  the House restaurant for Members and  their guests. The venison comes from the  hill country of central Texas and  the  chili mix was concocted by the late jefe  of chili, Wick Fowler.

122,House,95,-0.186,756,5,Mr. MAZZOLI.," Mr. Chairman, earlier  today I supported the rule providing for  the consideration of House Resolution  287 which establishes the new code of  financial ethics for the House of Repre sentatives.  While I prefer open rules-providing  !or free and unlimited amendment of  measures-there are  times  like  today  when the adoption of profound and cru cial measures like House Resolution 287  would be hindered and perhaps scuttled  by insistence on an open rule.  The Rules Committee reached a work able, satisfactory compromise. The rule  made certain amendments in order while  preventing  the ""Christmas-treeing""  to  death of this vital legislation. I am de lighted the rule was adopted.  The Obey Commission has done  a  masterful job in discharging the monu mental burden of drafting a workable  code of congressional financial ethics.  I applaud, also, my friend and neigh bor, Congressman LEE HAMILTON, and his  task force for their tremendous contri butions to the final recommendations of  the Commission on Administrative Re view.  As a  cosponsor of House Resolution  287,  I urge that it be adopted  just as  reported by the Obey Commission with out amendments.  Some will argue here today that re quiring  comprehensive  financial  dis closure and limiting outside earnings for  Members of  the House will drive good  people who  lack  independent financial  means away from the Congress.  In fact,  those States which have al ready enacted strict financial ethics laws  of this kind have not experienced a de cline in the numbers of talented candi dates and in the numbers of qualified  incumbents offering themselves for public  service.  Our current salary level is $57,500. The  limit on outside income in the Obey rec ommendations is a quite reasonable 15  percent of that salary.  Such a  limit permits those among us  who have special needs or special situa tions to supplement their now-generous  salaries in helpful amounts without en tangling themselves in possible confiicts  of interest and without devoting so many  hours to outside pursuits as to impinge  upon  the  time  needed  to  discharge  elected duties.  Furthermore, in light of the recent sal ary  increases,  it is going  to be harder  than ever to convince John Q. Taxpayer  that his Representative cannot get by  on a possible income of $66,125. That will  not ""play well in Peoria.""  Our purpose today, Mr. Chairman, is  to adopt strong, workable and effective  rules governing  a Member's financial  ethics. We do so both because to do so  is correct and right, and because to do  so  is for the House to regain, at least  partly, the confidence and esteem of the  public.  Though the Obey commission package  is a major step  forward,  I  feel other  changes in congressional procedures are  indicated in order to conclude the seri ous business of  restoring  the public's  trust in the legislative branch of Govern ment.  For example, the Congress must move  with speed to pass legislation providing  for partial public financing of Congres sional campaigns. I have voted twice in  the recent past for public financing of  congressional  campaigns,  but  such  a  measure needs the strong support of the  leadership on both sides of the aisle to  be enacted.  We must replace the antiquated Fed eral Lobbying Act of 1947 with a bill with  teeth and no loopholes. Such a measure  was  reported from my Judiciary Sub committee and the full committee and  passed the House last year but died in  the waning hours of the 94th Congress.  We must get  to  the bottom of  the  ""Korean Connection"" once and for all  and take action unflinchingly against the  wrongdoers.  And, we must act to prevent any fu ture backdoor pay increases for Mem bers of Congress.  Some of us may have approved of the  recent pay raise. Some of us may have  opposed it. Whatever. The fact remains  that the raise went into effect without a  hitch-and without a public vote.  I find these backdoor tactics unaccept able and unbecoming of  the greatest  deliberative body  in the world.  If we are sincere in our efforts to be  an accountable, open and responsive as sembly of lawmakers-if we are sincere  in wanting to work to regain the confi dence of the public-we must alter the  current method of granting Members of  Congress pay increases. We must require  a public vote on any future pay or cost of-living adjustments.  I am today reintroducing my CongJ.es sional Pay Reform Act of 1977 with 17  additional cosponsors. This brings  the  number of cosponsors to 28.  My bill would: eliminate all automatic  cost-of-living  congressional  pay  in creases; separate all future congressional  pay increases from those recommended  for  other  categories  of Federal  em ployees; and require a public vote on  pay raises and all cost-of-living adjust ments  recommended  for Members  of  Congress.  I have dispatched a letter to the chair man of the Post Office and Civil Service  Committee urging  that his committee  report my bill to the fioor expeditiously.  Unless the law is changed before October,  we will  all  receive-by  the backdoor  which is still wide open-a sizable pay  adjustment.  In remarks I placed in the RECORD last  week, Mr. Chairman, I called this con gressional  cost-of-living  adjustment  ""Christmas in October.""  I concluded by saying: ""Let's be tradi tionalists. Let us celebrate Christmas in  December-not October.""  So, Mr. Chairman, as I see it Congress  needs  to adopt  the Obey Commission  recommendations today. Then it needs  to go to work on a new lobbying disclos ure bill, a public financing bill, and a  measure requiring that all pay raises for  Members of Congress be voted upon.  Then-and only  then-will Congress  have really grasped the nettle and have  taken the necessary steps which wm en able public service at the Federal level  to become again-in  the eyes of  the  public-the honorable and noble profes sion we know it to be.  At this point, I would like to insert ex traneous material  into  the  RECORD  which bears upon the measure we are  considering today :  [From the Washington Post, Feb. 28, 1977]  CONGRESSIONAL EARNINGS AND ETHICS  to  The congressional controversies over regu lation of members' outside earnings show  how times have changed. Serving in Congress  used to be a part-time  job. Members con vened here for a few months and then went  back  their professions and businesses.  Private income was essential and viewed as  generally  legitimate.  Illegal  arrangements  were dealt with case by case, i.f at all.  Now, serving  in Congress has become a  year-round  job. Official pay and allowances  are so ample after  tbe  latest pay raise to  $57,500  that members don't get very  far  pleading financial hardship as  justification  for making money on the side. At the same  time, the potential for confiicts of interest  and public concern about ethical problems  have  increased dramatically. And  the pre",1977
123,House,95,-0.464,769,5,Mr. KOCH.," Mr. Chairman, this reso lution, House Resolution 287, prepared  by  the Commission on Administrative  Review, and shepherded  through  this  House by my colleague and friend, DAVID  OBEY, is a milestone, and DAVID OBEY de serves not only credit for his leadership  but  thanks from  the Members of  this  House for having preserved and for over coming the obstacles placed in his way.  House Resolution 287 is long overdue  and I have no hesitation in voting for it.  Regrettably, however, it does not equal  my own current practices in  this area  which  I  shall continue. When  I was  elected to Congress in November 1968, I  withdrew from  the practice of law be cause I believed then and now that Con gress is a full time job. Since taking office  in 1969, I have filed each year with the  Committee on Standards of Official Con duct, a  certified statement of my net  worth available for public inspection be cause I believe that a legislator's constit uency is entitled to know whether the  wealth of  its Representative has  in creased while in office and if so, why and  how.  For the past 3 years I have filed with  the Committee on Standards of Official  Conduct, a full and complete copy of my  Federal income tax return which is also  available for public inspection. My con gressional salary is my sole earned in come. In addition, I take no honorariums  for speaking engagements of any kind  because, again, I believe that only my em ployer, the U.S. Government, should pay  my salary, and it is doing that. If I am  invited to address a group of people, I  know  they are  inviting me not as En  KocH, but as ""Congressman"" En KocH,  and when I appear in such cauacity, no  one except the U.S. Government should  pay my salary.  While outside earnings are permitted  under this bill, I believe that the legis lation would be vastly  improved if the  provision for such earings we-re e-limi nated entirely.  The Commission on Administrative Re view, according to its report of February  14, 1977, is currently studying the admin istrative operation of the House, includ ing audit and personnel procedures, and  is scheduled to report back to the House  this year. I we1come  the Commission's  proposals in this area, be-cause I believe  we are all desirous of putting our ""House""  in order. We have a responsibility to our selves and to the public we serve to main tain  the highest standards of conduct.  The legislation we are considering today  and the proposals which are forthcoming  provide us with  this opportunity and  should receive our enthusiastic support.  ",1977
124,House,95,-0.298,769,5,Mr. FISHER.," Mr. Chairman, I want to  lend my strong endorsement  to House  Resolution 287,  the Obey Commission  recommendations on financial ethics. The  Commission's report is a necessary step  forward  in  the process of formulating  improved guidelines for financial respon sibility in the House of Representatives.  I realized from my first days in office  that the existing office accounts system  discouraged efficient office management,  lacked clear standards of accountability  and encouraged the maintenance of cer tain unofficial office accounts funded by  private contributions. The continued ab sence of a uniform code of official con duct applicable  to a Member of Con gress' public and personal finances was  clearly unacceptable and, ~ike many other  Members of the House, I welcomed the  establishment of the Obey Commission  on Administrative Review.  On several occasions I submitted my  vi-ews  to the Commission and its Task  Force on Financial Accountability. In my  testimony before the Commission, I de veloped  three general principles which  in my judgment are necessary for con structive reform: First, a  total ban on  the commingling of private and public  moneys through the elimination of un official office accounts with only public  funds being used for  the official func tions of a Congressional office;  second,  the consolidation of office accounts into  three  general  functions-personnel,  travel, and office-to facilitate efficient  management of a congressional office and  third, full accounting of every source of  income and every expenditure made in  connection with a  congressional office  with complete independent audits. In ad dition, I urged strongly that both per sonal and campaign  finances be  fully  and promptly disclosed as I have been  doing as a matter of course.  In some cases I urged the Commission  to  recommend  stronger  reforms  than  those before us today, but on the whole  the Obey Commission work has moved  the House decisively in the direction of  much-needed reform and this resolution  should be approved.  I want to comment particularly on the  three sections of this resolution which  deal with the elimination of unofficial of fice accounts-special accounts for of fice use funded by private contributions the restriction on outside earned income,  and the subject of gifts of personal hos pitality to Members of Congress.  I am faced with the same problem en countered by most other Members of the  House; that is, under the existing office  accounts system, I find a need for out side funds  to carry out certain of the  operations of my Washington office and  district constituent services. In my case  the need has been for additional funds  for informing my constituents about the  problems I am working on through news letters and  reports on  town meetings.  This situation  is created  in  large part  by the number and inflexibility of the  present office accounts which frustrates  the allocation of funds  to priority uses  determined by each Member's unique  needs.  However, I also recognize the need to  abolish all unofficial office accounts  in  order to make a clear distinction between  the use of public and private funds by  a Member of Congress. A high wall must  be maintained  between  public  and  private  funds.  I  strongly endorse  the  Commission's proposed ban on unofficial  office accounts as this will guarantee that  all official functions of a congressional  office will be financed solely by the public  treasury. Especially objectionable is the  triggering of large expenditures of gov ernment money,  say  for  franking, by  relatively  small  outlays  of  privately  contributed funds. In eliminating these  unofficial office accounts, we must take  care that sufficient public funds are made  available for the legitimate functions of  a  congressional office  such  as  news letters and other necessary constituent  information activities.  To  address  this need  for  adequate  funds,  the Obey Commission  recom mends a removal of the distinction be tween expenses for a Member's Wash ington  office  and  his  district  offices.  Under current House rules, certain funds  are earmarked for expenses outside the  District of Columbia and cannot be used  for Washington office needs,  such  as  newspaper subscriptions and  the  like.  This resolution would create a general  official expenses fund. In addition,  the  allowance for official expenses would be  increased. This will help each Member  to maintain  the quality of constituent  service and information he or she has  achieved without having to rely on the  use of unofficial office accounts.  On  the  subject  of  outside  income  earned by a Member in addition to his  salary, I  support the resolution's limit  of 15 percent per year with a  limit of  $750 or $1,000  froJil any one source. I  have urged the Commission in the past  to  recommend a  total ban on outside  earned income and I still would prefer  this. A total ban would be appropriate in  my judgment in view of the fact that  congressional salaries were recently in crea~ed. But reluctantly I have concluded  the 15 percent limit is the best we can  do at this time. I oppose the amendment  to increase the ceiling on outside earned  income to $15,000, nearly twice the 15  percent amount. In my own case, in the  absence of acceptable limits, I have de clined all honorariumc:; and the like.  The Obey Commission noted the dif ference between investment income and  outside earned  income but decided  to  place no strictures on the former. I would  go a step further than the Commission  in  the  treatment of unearned  income  from financial investments and property  holdings. I  recognize the impracticality  of eliminating  investment  income  for  Members of Congress;  for example, a  CXXUI--373-Part G  ",1977

At the  time of this vote I was returning to the  House after meeting with the Attorney  General in my capacity as chairman of  the House Select Committee on Narcotics  Abuse and Control. Had I been present,  I would have voted ""yea"" on the previous  question. My meeting with the Attorney  General  had  been  scheduled  several  weeks ago and was of such a nature that  it could not be postponed. Were it not for  the congested traffic in our Capital City,  I would have been able to record my vote  on this important question.  BICENTENNIAL AMNESTY FOR  UNREGISTERED ALIENS  The SPEAKER. Under a previous or der of the House,  the gentleman from  New York <Mr. BADILLO) is recognized for  5 minutes.  Mr. BADn.LO. Mr. Speaker, last year,  I  introduced a bill to grant amnesty to  illegal aliens living in this country. I am  today reintroducing this legislation, with  one major change-a change I was moved  to make by what I have seen as a new  spirit in our administration, a new-and  realistic-awareness of ~he need for ""for giveness,"" a need expressed by the Presi dent in his granting of amnesty to draft  evaders. Because my bill is being intro duced in the first year of our Nation's  third century, I have decided to place the  effective date on the day of our Bicenten nial: my bill will grant amnesty to all  those unregistered aliens who have re sided in this country prior to July 4, 1976.  Mr. Speaker, since the new President's  election, perhaps sparked by the recent  ills,  visit by the President of Mexico, there  has been an increasing concern about our  Nation's immigration policies, and sub sequently a growing pressure on the Con gress for legislative action. This activity  has been exacerbated by our economic  problems, as the lack of available blue collar  jobs has been equated, wrongly,  with the number of illegal aliens now in  America.  As a member of the Spanish -speaking  community, I am acutely aware of what  the problems are-and  I  am  equally  aware as to what the problems are not.  There are now between 8 and 10 million  illegal residents in this country. Many of  them have been in this country for sev eral years, and have established produc tive lives and are making real contribu tions to our country. Many of them pay  taxes, and share in the responsibilities  of citizenship. The only thing that dif ferentiates them from those of us in this  room is that they do not have the proper  papers. These are people who have com mitted themselves to the United States,  and we can no longer treat them  in humanely.  It is  time that Congress address the  question of  illegal aliens, and I concur  with those of my colleagues who have  called for immediate action. But we can not let illegal aliens become the scape goats  for our country's economic  and we cannot threaten legitimate citi zens with the loss of their livelihoods. by  imposing fines on employers or taking  other sanctions against them. That ap proach would only  lead  to one  thing:  employers would cease hiring all those  who even appear foreign  to avoid  the  possibility of hiring an  illegal worker.  Another possibility that I oppose strenu ously  is  that which would eventually  mean a national  identity card.  I  find  this a gross abridgement of civil rights.  We cannot, in 1977, tolerate the passage  of legislation that would perpetuate the  kind of discrimination we have spent so  many years trying to overcome.  Many of us are aware of the raids that  have taken place in large urban areas to  round up large numbers of illegal resi dents at the same time. These raids have  pointed up the preposterous notion that  we can deport all 8 or 10 million people  who have come here without. papers. In  order to deport that great number of  people  I  believe we would need more  troops  than we  sent  to Indochina-a  patently absurd concept.  The only viable solution is to grant an  amnesty  those people who are now  here-an amnesty that would give these  people not, as  is commonly suggested,  citizenship, but only ""green card""-resi dent  alien-status,  and permit  these  people to work toward becoming full citi zens of the United States.  It is the beginning of a solution to an  international problem, and once such leg islation  is passed, we must then move  forward  toward a permanent way  which we can deal with a problem that  can only be exacerbated as time goes by.  We must realize that illegal immigration  is a diplomatic problem as well as an em ployment problem.

134,,95,-0.576,847,5,Mrs. BURKE of California.," Mr.  Speaker, today I wish to reintroduce a  joint resolution designating March 1319, 1977, as National Community Health  Week.  A growing number of communities are  already observing National Community  Health Week under the sponsorship of  the Community Health Association, Inc.  This organization is headed by my good  friend, Dr. Ruth Temple of Los Angeles,  who has devoted an inordinate amount  of time and energy to the establishment  of community health centers.  Community health centers have been  established under the auspices of Fed eral, State, and  local governments  to  insure  that no  individual or commu nity is denied health services because of  unavailability,  inadequate financial re sources or other such barriers. Yet  to day, many Americans still suffer needlessly because they are unaware of the  resources available to them through such  community health centers.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Designation of a National Commu nity Health Week would provide an op portunity for a united effort in health  education by the participation of busi ness,  labor, religious and civic groups,  as well as individual citizens. This would  encourage swift identification, diagnosis  and treatment of persons having health  problems  by  increasing  community  awareness  of  the  services  available  through community health centers.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me in  this endeavor.  WHY DO 4,300 SCHOOL DISTRICTS  NEED IMPACT AID FUNDS?  HON. HERBERT F. HARRIS  II  OF VmGINIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 2, 1977  ",1977
135,,95,-0.324,847,5,Mr. HARRIS.," Mr. Speaker,  the 1978  Federal education budget-both the Ford  proposal and  the Carter revision-re quests elimination of $395 million in im pact aid funds, half of what our schools  received in the current school year. Im pact Aid funds go  to 420 congressional  districts and over 4,300 school districts.  The 1978 budget request would eliminate  funding for all ""B"" children, students  whose parents live or work on Federal  property, such as a military base or ms  office.  Impact aid funds have been part of  local school budgets for 27 years. They  are used as general operating funds pro viding the basics in a school system, from  heat and water  to blackboards. These  proPOsed cuts, then, will cut into the very  heart of the local school system. And they  come at a time when local school budgets  cannot withstand another Federal cut.

139,Senate,95,0.272,925,5,Mr. ROTH.," Mr.  President,  since  serving in the Congress, one of my speI  cia! concerns has been the plight of the  older American. No group has been more  responsible for the success and prosperity  of this Nation than the older generation.  I am confident that if this Nation had  retained the traditions and goals of the  older generation, this Nation would be  far better off  today. They did not ask  for something for nothing. What they  did seek was the opportunity to work and  rise as high as their ability would take  them; the opportunity to live and work  in peace and security. Because of their  faith and willingness to work hard and  -even  sacrifice,  this country grew and  prospered to become the greatest democ racy this Earth has ever witnessed.  For these reasons, I intend to make the  special needs of older people one of my  top priorities in my second Senate term.  Today, I am presenting what I will call  my preliminary senior citizen package.  I do not want to suggest that this pack age offers  the answers  to all of  the  problems of senior citizens, or that this is  all that I intend to do, but rather this is a  starting point from which I plan to build.  Senior citizens  in my own State of  Delaware have expressed  their major  concerns to me, particularly in the past  few years, as income, crime, health care,  and trying to maintain their independ ence for as long as possible.  Therefore,  am  today  introducing  three bills to address two of the most  important concerns of senior citizens a stable family life and protection from  crime.  First, I am introducing a bill to pro vide a $1,000 tax deduction to taxpayers  who provide housing and shelter for a  senior citizen. The intent of this legis lation is to encourage people to provide  homes for  their elderly parents, rela tives, or friends as an alternative  to  the use of nursing homes.  While nursing home care  is  indeed  necessary in many cases,  this provides  financial relief to families who wish to  provide  their  relatives  a  comfortable  home life.  The Federal Government provides a  number of grant and assistance programs  for  the  elderly,  including  nutrition,  transportation, and housing programs.  But I believe that Congress has failed  to provide a simple, straightforward ap proach to help children care for their  elderly parents who really do not want  nor need to live in a nursing home.  The family unit should be the most  important aspect of everyone's life, and  I am hopeful that this legislation will  strengthen the role of the family in this  country.  Today I am also introducing two bills  designed to combat the victimization of  our elderly citizens. These bills would es tablish mandatory minimum sentences  for certain crime committed against the  elderly within Federal jurisdictions. The  first bill would amend several sections  of title 18 of the United States Code and  the other would amend comparable pro visions of title 22 of the District of Co lumbia Code. Although limited to Federal Jurisdictions, these measures could  serve as models for the States.    The mandatory minimum sentences  would range from 3 months for assault  by striking or beating to 15 years for  second-degree murder. These new sen tencing provisions would apply where  the victim of the crime is 60 years of  age or older. The bills would also pro hibit  the sentencing  judge  from  sus pending sentence or granting probation  and the application of numerous statu tory programs, which could otherwise be  used to substantially reduce the actual  time of incarceration, would be expressly  disallowed.  I  believe  that  imposing mandatory  minimum sentences  for violent crime  will aid in the reduction of crime. I am  convinced that quick and certain impris onment is a deterrent to crime. For too  long our law has centered its attention  on the rights of the criminal defendant.  It is time now for the law to concern it self more with protecting the people. we  need to devote more attention to the vic tims of crime, most importantly the older  American.  In addition to the legislation I am in troducing today, I have cosponsored leg islation this year that will take the nec essary  steps  to  eliminate  fraud  and  abuses  in  the medicare and medicaid  programs, to assure that every Federal  and State dollar in these programs  is  used  to provide  the greatest possible  medical services to our elderly poor. I  have  also  cosponsored  legislation  to  maintain the Senate Special Committee  on Aging, and cosponsored a bill to pro vide a  significant increase in the old age, survivors, and disability insurance  benefits for individuals who voluntarily  delay their retirement beyond age 65.  I would like to emphasize that this is  a preliminary ""senior citizen package."" I  am u~appy with the earnings limita tion under social security, and am look ing forward to seeing the computations  of the result of this question on my 1977  questionnaire  to all Delaware house holds. I am looking into ways to further  relieve the tax burden on senior citizens  and to protect expanded pension protec tion for the elderly. Another concern of  mine is the high amount that senior citi zens pay for drugs out of their pockets  each year. I am looking into these and  other issues of concern to the elderly.  I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the three bills I am introducing today  be included in the REcoRD.  There being no objection,  the bills  were  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  Record, as follows:  s. 888  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of  Representatives of  the United States of  America in Congress assembled, That section  151 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954  (relating  to allowance of deductions  for  personal exemptions)  is amended by adding  at the end thereof the following new sub section:  ""(f)  ADDITIONAL  EXEMPTION  FOR  EACH  SENIOR CITIZEN HOUSED BY THE TAXPAYER.

140,Senate,95,-0.567,964,5,Mr. NELSON.," Mr. President, on Jan uary 31, I  introduced S. 517 and S. 518  PERCY  with Senators BAYH, CLARK, JAVITS, and  to provide for a 3-year experi mental study of fiexible and compressed  work  schedules  in Federal  executive  agencies and to establish part-time work  opportunities in every executive agency  of the Government.  This legislation would enable the Fed eral Government-the Nation's largest  employer-to creatively utilize members  of the labor force whose schedules do not  permit them to work a  traditional 40hour workweek or whose personal or  familial  responsibilities make  adher ence to a  fixed schedule very difficult.  Women with family responsibilities, older  workers who no longer want a full-time  job but who cannot afford to drop out of  the work force altogether, students and  handicapped individuals all would' ben efit from the enactment of this legisla tion. But they would not be the sole bene ficiaries.  Evidence gathered at House and Sen ate hearings on similar legislation in the  94th Congress shows that the operation  of the Federal Government could be im proved by the adoption of flexible and  compressed work schedules and by the  installation of part-time working oppor tunities.  A number of private companies cur rently are rearranging workweeks, and  several million workers are involved in  these efforts. The 4-day workweek is just  one example of the various changes now  underway.  It is estimated that some 1.2 million  Americans presently are  scheduled  to  work a 4-day, 40-hour workweek. That  represents about 2 percent of the full time work force. But right now the Fed eral Government cannot even experi ment with the 4-day, 40-hour workweek  because Federal  law  requires  paying  overtime compensation to an employee  who works longer than an 8-hour day.  This requirement has precluded experi mentation with the so-called compressed  workweek in the Federal Government.  Two weeks  ago,  the Wall  Street  Journal ran two front page articles on  the usage of  the 4-day workweek  in  private industry. These articles discussed  the status of  the 4-day workweek  in  America, and  they explored both  the  benefits  and  disadvantages  of  these  working schedules.  Information given  in  these  articles  demonstrates the need for the Federal  Government  to have  the authority  to  to begin experimenting with the 4-day  workweek so that  the Nation's largest  employer can determine empirically  if  workers' productivity and the quality of  their working lives could be enhanced by  the  installation  of  such workweeks.

Let me  say  to my  friend, without  meaning to criticize that office particu larly, but in a discussion with our Gov ernor 2 or 3 days ago, many of us came  to the conclusion that Mr. Dunne seems  to spend more  time  figuring out why  things cannot be done than why they can  thank the  be done. Again, as I say, I have great  regard for my colleague  from Massa chusetts and his committee and what  they might be able to do in a persuasive  way to, hopefully, broaden Mr. Dunne's  vision to listen, in many cases.

151,,95,-0.514,1094,5,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, as a mem ber of the Select Committee on Narcotics  March 3, 1977  Abuse and Control, and having chaired  the hearings in New York regarding this  disastrous problem, I recently read an ar ticle which appeared on Saturday, Febru ary 12, 1977, in the New York Times de scribing the necessity for stronger sen tencing in narcotics violations. The ar ticle is written by Clifford S. Fishman,  Esq .  an executive assistant district at torney in the office of prosecution, special  narcotics courts in New York City.  Since there is continual controversy as  to the correlation between stiffer sen tences and a decrease in trafficking, and  as an advocate of stiffer sentences, I felt  my colleagues would be interested in this  article.  It follows:  THE SWAMP THAT BREEDS HEROIN ADDICTION  all  (By Clifford S. Fishman)  A recent study labeled New York's drug  laws a ""failure"" because the laws have not  deterred the spread of heroin addiction. Such  studies, however, ask the wrong questions of  the wrong people, and are based on a false  premise--that heroin addiction is a law-en forcement problem.  Heroin addiction is not a law-enforcement  problem;  it is a  societal problem. Human  misery-poverty,  occupational and  educa tional discrimination, subhuman housing is the fundamental cause of heroin addiction;  and since the profits from heroin traffic are so  enormous, there will always be those willing  to exploit that misery.  To expect any law to .. deter heroin addic tion"" is naive and simplistic. At most, laws  and law enforcement can impede the spread  of addiction until the conditions that breed  addiction are rectified.  Before the enactment of the current drug  laws, narcotics traffic in New York was not  only immensely profitable; it was for all prac tical purposes a risk-free industry. A -,tudy  conducted by the State Investigations Com mission disclosed that in 1970-71 only 11 per cent of  those  convicted of narcotics  felonies received a prison sentence of more  than one year. The commission concluded  that ""exceedingly lenient sentences in nar cotics cases have encouraged violation of the  narcotics laws and have severely impeded the  law enforcement effort.""  That conclusion was entirely accurate. A  successful narcotics investigation resembles  a step ladder. A street seller is apprehended  and is persuaded to cooperate. As a result,  his supplier is apprehended. In turn, the sup plier agrees to inform against his superiors,  and so on up the ladder. Without a credible  threat of substantial punishment, a low-or  middle-level dealer will laugh at the police man or prosecutor who seeks his cooperation.  Similarly, without a realistic threat of im prisonment, many addicts will not be moti vated toward rehabllitation.  The new laws have had a substantial im pact. During 1975, for example, 46 percent of  the defendants convicted of committing nar cotics felonies throughout the state received  sentences in excess of one year, compared to  the 11 percent in 1970-71. In New York City's  centralized  special narcotics courts, more  than 56 percent of those convicted of ""new  law"" narcotics felonies received multi-year  sentences. Assertions  that  the mandatory sentence provisions have made it more dUH cult to obtain convictions are simply un true. Approximately 76 percent of a.ll  jury  trials conducted  in  the central narcotics  courts have resulted in convictions-a higher  conviction rate than that for non-drUg cases  in the city.  The stiff mandatory sentences and the pos sibility of probation for those who cooperate  with the authorities have enabled law-en forcement officers to obtain informants' co operation to a degree previously thought im",1977

156,Senate,95,-0.314,1172,5,Mr. HUDDLESTON.," Mr. President, in  my continuing efforts to secure Federal  assistance to solve a truly national prob lem, the transportation of energy sup plies from point of origin to point of use,  I am pleased to introduce this legislation.  The bill I offer will establish a new  category, in the Federal aid highway sys tem, for the repair and restoration of  energy impacted highways. That is to  say, I wish to see Federal money allocated  for the repair of highways which have  incurred and are still  incurring sub stantial additional use and damage as a  result of national energy requirements.  The measure I proposed today sets up  a 70 per centum Federal, 30 per centum  State matching program to meet a criti cal portion of the energy supply trans portation problem. Surely this problem  must be addressed if we are to rely on our  Nation's most abundant energy resource,  coal, in developing a cohesive national  energy policy.  The difficulty is simply that we cannot  increase by 50 percent or 100 percent or  300 percent the production and utiliza tion of coal in this country just by Gov ernment decree. We must have the meth ods, No. 1, of getting it out of the ground  in environmentally accepted ways. Also,  we must be able to move it to the places  where it is going to be used, where it can  be transported and marketed. Right now,  the rails and the highway system over  which the majority of this coal has to  move are deteriorating at a rapid rate,  deteriorating  faster  than  the current  highway and ran programs will permit  repair and maintenance. Thus, we must  decide whether or not we can provide the  routes and highways over which to move  the coal that is desperately needed and  will be needed for years.  As certain Members are aware the De partment of Transportation is about to  complete a  thorough study of the need  for Federal highway assistance of the  nature I  have prescribed. The Depart ment is doing so as a result of my amend ment to the 1976 Highway Act. Though  I look forward to whatever recommenda tions might come from this effort, I be lieve the time for action is long overdue.  Therefore, I urge prompt action on the  bill which I  introduce today.  By Mr. HUDDLESTON:  S. 908.

159,,95,-0.04,1276,5,Mr. MATHIS.," Mr. Speaker, the 17th  Annual Convention of the National Pea nut Council which was  held  in San  Francisco,  February  has  des ignated 1977 ""The Year of the Peanut.""  As the representative of the largest pea nut producting area in the Nation, I want  to recognize the NPC for its contribution  to the peanut industry and to partially  recount, as reported to me, the conven tion's activities designed to increase the  peanut's role as a major source of human  nutrition.  The NPC is the major spokesman for  all  segments of  the peanut  industry.  Headquartered in the Washington area,  its membership consists of growers, shell ers processors, peanut butter and con fectionery manufacturers, foreign buy ers, brokers, and others directly involved  in the industry. Other members include  banks and agribusiness enterprises with  an interest in serving the peanut indus try. The NPC is a completely private or ganization and is not connected with any  governmental body. In addition to the  regular members, representatives of the  press, the U.S. Department of Agricul ture, and the House Agriculture Commit tee were present at the convention as  guests.  The  annual  convention  provides  practically the only opportunity for all  persons interested in the peanut business  to meet and share their views and ex periences on events that interest them.  Most participants feel the annual con vention contributes significantly toward  brightening the future of the industry  for the benefit of all concerned.  The list of this year's guest speakers  was particularly  impressive. Mr. Juan  del Castillo, Director of the Food Dis tribution Division of the Department of  Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Serv ice, spoke on the use of peanuts in the  school lunch program. The dollar value  of peanuts used in the program has con tinued to increase on the basis of the Fed eral Government's confidence in peanuts  as an important source of high quality  protein for the Nation's schoolchildren.  Because  of  their  highly  nutritious  characteristics, peanuts do not belong ex clusively in the snack category but per form as part of a well-balanced meal,  whether in the form of peanut butter or  the nuts themselves. Of increasing im portance are peanut flakes, a patented  peanut product used as a protein ex tender for other foods or even as the key  ingredient in simulated meat and poultry  dishes.  The NPC's public  relations  coun selors-Smith, Bucklin & Associates gave a presentation on the promotion of  traditional peanut recipes publicized in  national magazines and on  television.  The connection between peanuts and the  including  products,  peanut  new  and  recent Presidential election has dramati cally increased public interest in peanuts,  it was pointed out, and the NPC has been  deluged with inquiries about all phases  of the industry.

165,House,95,0.401,28,12,Mr. STOCKMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in opposition to the resolution before us.  I just want to make clear before I pro ceed into the argument that we do not  take this position in this case for the pur pose of merely overturning the result of  a certified election. We are not taking  this position, because we wish  to deny  the seat to a sitting Member of this body,  because we want to see a seat switched  from one side of the aisle to the other,  and certainly not because we think the  proceedings which took place before our  panel and our full committee were unfair.  Mr. Speaker, our purpose,  really,  raising these questions on these resolu tions is to prevent the accumulation of  precedents which, in our judgment, will  render our whole contested elections pro cedure null and void and will make it,  for all practical purposes, a useful instru ment to resolve election contests.  I think it is important for the House  to understand that the resolution before  the House today is not the product of a  hearing on the merits of this case. No  evidence was gathered by the committee.  Neither of the parties involved in this  contest took depositions or other steps to  gather evidence. No examination or cross  examination occurred.  All of the procedures that are Provided  by U.S.C. 386 to 389 were not used, be cause we did not get  that  far. This  motion to dismiss was interposed; and  as a result, the basic procedures of the  Contested Elections Act were not used.  The fact is that the motion to dismiss  must clearly rest on a showing by the  contestee  that  grounds  sufficient  to  change the result of the election were  not presented.  Mr. Speaker, the majority of the panel  and the majority of the committee have  concluded that such grounds were not  presented.  I would like to take jus.t about 2 min utes  to  lay before  the House some of  the information that was contained in  the notice of contest, in the pleadings  of the contestant in this case, and then  I would ask the Members, on the basis  of  this evidence, whether or not  they  think sufficient grounds were presented.  The following pieces of  information  were presented  to us  in  the original  notice of the contestant, first, it showed  that  there were  10  votes  that were  counted for the contestee which actually  belonged to the contestant, as a result  of a discovery recount that was made,  and those have not been questioned by  the contestee.  Second, it showed in this same dis covery  recount which was carried out  pursuant to State procedure, that there  were 230 ballots which were uninitialed  by the election judges and, nevertheless,  they were counted, even though that is  a violation of the State law in Illinois.  The  third  thing  that  the  notice  showed, or contended, or alleged, was  that there were 611 ballots containing  distinguishing marks, numbers, some of  them in sequential order;  these ballots  also contained lines, checks, and all of  these marks, again, are prohibited by the  election act in Illinois.  These ballots were counted, therefore,  in violation of the basic election act in  this State under which the election was  carried out.  Then, finally, the notice of contest filed  by the contestant contained the names  and  addresses of  20  individuals who  voted in that election despite the fact  that they had been stricken from  the  registration rolls previous to the election.  Nevertheless,  those ballots cast by un registered voters were counted.  What does this add up to? It adds up  to a showing, a clear, concrete, material  showing, that 871 ballots were counted in  that contest which were either-No. 1,  erroneously tabulated; No. 2, counted in  violation of  the State law; or, No. 3,  illegally cast.  We were dealing with an election in volving a difference of only 201 votes and  we have a showing in the pleadings, in  the notice of contest,  that there were  871 ballots which are subject to question.  The only thing that the notice of.con test does not show  is whether or not  each of those 871, or even 500 of them,  would have gone to the contestee or the  declared winner  that election, Mr.  MIKVA and, therefore, would not change  the outcome.  But I .would suggest to the House that  proving which way each one of  those  ballots would have gone  is not some thing that has to be done in the initial  notice;  that is something  that should  be done during hea.rings on the merits.  This case is far different from some of  those we have had in the past, because  I think the notice is sufficient and dem onstrates that the outcome could have  been different.  I would urge that the House recommit  this matter to the committee.  ",1977

167,Senate,95,0.575,67,12,Mr. WALLOP.," Mr. President, in fiscal  year 1977 we will pour $38 billion down  the drain. In fiscal year 1978 the figure  is even higher-$43 billlon. By 1982, the  figure will be over $50 btllion. These are  the moneys we must pay for interest on  the public debt. These vast sums rank  only below what we spend for  income  security, national defense, and health.  Unlike these other areas, funds  to pay  off interest on the national debt serve no  productive ends.  It is time we took serious steps to bal ance the Federal budget and eleminate  the  unacceptably  large  interest pay ments. According to a recent Gallup poll,  nearly 80 percent of the public favors this  action. Although Congress has  taken  some steps toward fiscal accountability,  outlays continue to exceed receipts and  the national debt continues to increase.  We have not done enough to stem this  infia tionary tide.  I  am  introducing  today a  constitu tional amendment  to provide for bal anced budgets and eliminate Federal in. debtedness. This resolution would require  a balanced budget by 1980 and that 5 per cent of the national debt be paid off each  year, thereafter making the Federal Gov ernment debt free by the  turn of  the  century. The resolution ls identical to the  one introduced in the House by Repre sentatives JACOBS and KEYS which has  received strong bipartisan support.  Mr. President, putting our financial  house 1n order is not a partisan goal.  Whatever method we  choose,  it  in  everyone's best interest.  I ask unanimous consent that the text  of  the  resolution  be  printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  the  joint  resolution was ordered to be printed 1n  the RECORD, as follows:  is  S.J. RES. 50  Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America  in Congress assembled  (two-thirds of each  House concurring therein), That the follow ing article ls hereby proposed as an amend ment  to  the Constitution  of  the United  States, which shall be valid  to all  intents  and purposes as part of  the Constitution  when ratified by the legislatures of  three !ourths of  the several States within  three  years a!ter H!l submission to the States for  ratification:  ""ARTICLE  ""SECTION 1. In exercising its powers under  article I of the Constitution, and in particu lar its powers to lay and collect taxes, duties,  imposts, and excises and to enact laws mak ing appropriations, the Congress shall assure  that the  tote.I outlays of  the Government  during any fiscal year do not exceed the total  receipts of the Government during such fis cal year and that the Federal indebtedness  is eliminated.  ""Szc. 2. During the first fiscal year begin ning after the ratification of this article, the  total  receipts of  the Government, not  in cluding receipts derived from  the  issuance  of bonds, notes, or other obligations of the  United States, shall not be less than 90 per  centum o! the total outlays, not including  any outlays  for  the redemption of bonds,  notes, or other obligations of  the United  States. During  the second  fiscal year,  the  total receipts shall not be less than 98 per  centum of the total outlays.  ""SEC. 3. During the fourth fiscal year be ginning after the ratification of this article  and  for each such succeeding year  there after,  total outlays shall not exceed  total  receipts.  ""Si::c. 4.

168,,95,0.283,119,12,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. President,  thank  the distinguished Senator from Michi gan, who is on the Rules Committee and  has a detailed understanding of this pro posal and  its pitfalls and of  the pro cedures of the Senate.  think we should take account of the  fact that rule XXII and  the filibuster  extension, or extended debate arrange ment, have come to be thought of in this  country as always dilatory and in some  ways unacceptable or undes;rable. How ever, it is a right to be protected.  I have voted for cloture as many times  as I have voted against it, if not a great  deal more often. I have no conviction, no  policy  that I will vote against cloture  each time or for cloture each time. I try  to cast each vote on the basis of whether  think there has been a good debate in  the Senate on the issue involved. I am  not one of those who think debate does  not make any difference. I  think it does.  I do not think it makes much difference  right this minute, because there are not  enough Members present to hear my re marks, and therefore enable me to judge  that impact.  However,  think that the time that  passes while  the Senate  is considering  a measure often has a beneficial effe~t.  The country comes  to understand  the  issues more fully  than it would  in an  abbreviated  time.  believe  that  the great  issues  that  have concerned the country have been  settled more often than not, notwith standing a  tough cloture rule and the  original provision for 100 hours of de bate, under adequate protections and  safeguards, after cloture.  In a word, 1\l[r. President, cloture has  served a good purpose many  times. It  has served its purpose well on the so called  ""conservative"" side,  as well  as  on  the so-called  ""liberal"" side.  I was  not here at the time, but I understand  that one of the granddaddy filibusters  of all times was on the COMSA T bill.  It is a question of insuring that the  country has an opportunity to hear ::i.nd  understand what is truly one's point of  view.  So, Mr. President, as we address that  situation, I hope that in Senate Reso lution 5 we do not design a circumstance  in which, after  the Senate agrees  to  cloture by three-fifths of a constitutional  majority, as is required in the present  state of  rule XXII, or  two-thirds of  those present and voting, as in the case  of a  rules change, we end  the oppor tunity to discuss  thoroughly the issues  before the Senate.  believe we are doing an important  thing  in considering  this  resolution.  said at the beginning of these remarks  that I  intended  to discuss  the matter  fully-not only with Members on  this  side of the aisle, but also with my col leagues on the other side of the aisle to try to find a common ground in agree ments or changes that might eliminate  our principal objections to this proposal.  I intend to discuss this matter at the  Republican Policy Committee meetings  today and  tomorrow, and  I  intend  to  I  5  make suggestions or to gather sugges tions as to how to work our way out of  this dilemma. I think there is a chance  that we can find an  improvement un  rule XX:ll to which we all can agree.  I do not think for one moment that  three-fifths or  we  should change  the  the two-thirds provisions of rule XXII.  They, indeed, are not under attack or  under consideration in Senate Resolu tion 5. But I  think there are serious de ficiencies  in Senate Resolution  as  presently written;  and unless we can  reach an agreement or some sort of com promise as to changes in this measwe,  I expect that it will be necessary to dis cuss it at some length.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  ",1977
169,,95,-0.211,119,12,Mr. CANNON.," Mr. President, the Com mittee on Rules and Administration re ported Senate Resolution 5, amending  the Standing Rules of the Senate rela tive to cloture, reading of the Journal,  amendments,  and  conference  reports,  and appeals from the Chair on quorums,  on April 18, 1977. This resolution, along  with a number of others, was submitted  and referred to the Rules Committee on  January 4 of this year, the first day of  this Congress, with  instructions  that  ""these resolutions, or that a  resolution  on the subject matter"" not be reported  back within 60 days, but to be reported  within ""not to exceed 90 days."" The time  limit was extended by a subsequent order,  hence  the  report was not  filed until  April 18.  Eight resolutions on the general sub ject were referred to the committee for  study, but Senate Resolution 5, submitted  by Mr. ROBERT c. BYRD, was the resolu tion  selected by  the committee  to be  reported;  it was  reported with  an  amendment in the nature of a substitute  by a vote of 6 yeas to 3 nays.  The  resolution  seeks  to  amend  the  rules so that if and when cloture is in voked on a pending motion, bill, or reso lution the Senate will be assured  that  final action will be forthcoming thereon  within a definite time. In the last Con gress  the cloture rule was used  to  the  extent that the Senate was brought al most to a standstill as far as it was pos sible  to act on proposed  legislation on  which cloture had been  invoked. This  certainly was not the intent of the Sen ate in its adoption of the cloture rule in  1917, and in adding amendments thereto  since that date. In the last Congress a  number of Senators became somewhat  alarmed at the inability of the Senate to  act on measures even after voting to in voke cloture. A number of Members have  discussed the problem with me, inquiring  if something could be done  to correct  that situation.  This resolution proposes to offer some  solution in the case of such abuses of  time in the future, and at the same time,  leave the Senate with unlimited debate  except when three-fifths, or two-thirds  in the case of rule changes, of its mem bership goes on record that the Senate  should act on the pending motion, reso lution, bill, or any other pending question.  Under these proposed changes in the  rules,  the Senate would still have  the  same right to refuse invoking cloture as  1  XXII  it now has-it would still take the same  vote. All but one of the proposed amend ments to rule xxn set forth in this reso lution would not become operative until  cloture had been invoked and that one  exception would be to the advantage of  those opposed to invoking cloture in that  it would not be in order to file a cloture  motion on any proposition until after the  elapse of 24 hours  following  the  time  after such a proposition had been laid  before  the Senate for  its consideration  in the first instance; under the present  procedure a cloture motion can be filed  on any motion or pending business as  soon as it has been laid before the Senate.  This proposed change at least assures the  Senate of a  limited  time  to  find out  something about  the pending proposal  before it is called upon to invoke cloture  thereon.  Currently after cloture is invoked on a  matter, the time taken for quorum calls,  rollcalls, reading of amendments, or any  other uses of  time not defined as ""no  Senator shall be entitled to speak in all  more  than  hour,""  is  not  charged  against any Senator's allotted 1 hour.  Hence,  it has been possible under  the  present rule, by the use of delaying tac tics,  to block for a  long time the final  disposition of a matter on which cloture  has been invoked.  In addition to the proposed changes in  rule  there  are  recommended  amendments to four other rules designed  to eliminate certain existing procedwes  that can be used under certain circum stances  to waste  the Senate's time namely:  reading of  long amendments  and conference reports, when they are  already  available  to  all  Senators  in  printed form,  the reading of which at  present may be dispensed with only if  unanimous consent is granted. The reso lution also proposed to dispense with the  reading of the Journal on motion as well  as by unanimous consent, another device  which has been used on various occasions  to delay action by the Senate.  Briefly, an analysis of the significant  provisions of Senate Resolution 5, dis closes  that if adopted it would amend  the Standing Rules of  the Senate as  follows:  Rule XXII would be amended to pro vide that once cloture has been invoked  on any proposition, a maximum of 50  hours of overall consideration would be  placed thereon after which time the Sen ate would begin to vote on its final dispo sition. At the close of 50 hours of con sideration following  the vote  to  invoke  cloture-including quorum calls, votes,  reading of amendments, debate, or the  consumption of time for any other pur pose-the Senate would proceed to vote  on final disposition to the exclusion of  any amendments at the desk not then  actually pending before  the Senate at  that time, and to the exclusion of all mo tions except a motion to table, a motion  to recommit, or a motion to reconsider  action previously  taken by  the Senate,  and one quorum call on demand to es tablish the presence of a quorun1-and  motions required to establish the pres ence of a quorum-and motions required  to establish a quorum such as a motion  to have the Sergeant at Arms request the  ",1977
170,,95,-0.469,132,12,Mr. FRASER.," Mr. Speaker, a  little  pamphlet, ""The Kingdom of the Nether lands,  Foreign  Policy,"" was  recently  brought to my attention. One of a series  of pamphlets on the Netherlands pub lished by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  the pamphlet summarizes in a few pages  that nation's foreign policy.  The final page of the booklet is de voted  to ""human rights."" These para graphs  expressing  the human  rights  stance of the Govenment of the Ne~er lands are worth repeating here:  HUMAN RIGHTS  The Netherlands Government  attaches  great value  to the  international promotion  and protection of human rights. The Gov ernment's concern for human rights stems  partly from the increased importance placed  particularly on human and social values in  the Netherlands in recent years. Influenced  by a growing awareness of the cohesion of  the wotld community and of the intertwin ing of political and economic events in the  world, the increased perception of norms has  extended  to wider  fields  than  those which  the international legal order was previously  thought to cover. At the present time, these  norms relate in particular to the preserva tion of peace, solidarity with the oppressed,  the lessening of social and economic injus tices in the world and the protection of hu man rights.  The Government considers  that concern  for  these values should be expressed in its  foreign policy. Continual suppression of hu man rights and situations of elementary in justice that offer no prospect of rectification  result ultimately in the eruption of tensions  which can sweep away all stability in the  world. It is therefore of vital importance to  the Netherlands, which is so closely bound  up in the international community, that she  commit herself to the international promo tion and protection of human rights,  this  being part of a dynamic policy of peace and  security.  The Netherlands tries to do everything pos sible within  the framework of  the United  Nations  to strengthen  the procedures  for  the maintenance of human rights,  in par ticular, the function of the right of appeal  of individuals and non-governmental orga nisations. In recent years,  the Netherlands  has ta.ken special initiatives aimed at com bating the use of torture, resulting among  other things in the adoption by the UN in  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  1975 of a Declaration for the Protection of  religious intolerance and the recognition of  objections to military service on grounds of  conscience. Together with other countries,  the Netherlands has pursued an active policy  directed  towards  improving  the  human  rights situation in Chile.  Moreover, the Netherlands is a party to the  European Convention  on Human Rights  whose conclusion she was  instrumental  in  bringing about.  WEST POINT PAYS TRIBUTE  HON. CHARLES B.

172,House,95,0.001,158,12,Mr. ICHORD.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to ask the gentleman this question:  Does the gentleman's position permit  a shipment of oil from Alaska to Japan  and then for Japan to replace that oil  with oil which they, in turn, have pur chased from  the OPEC nations, which  would certainly shorten the distance over  which Japan would have to transport its  oil? In other words, let them have the  Alaskan oil, but replace it with oil on the  eastern coast, which would be closer,  meaning there would be less transporta tion for it.  Does the gentleman's position permit  that?  Mr. McKINNEY. No, it does not. I am  particularly glad  that my  friend,  the  gentleman from Missouri <Mr. !CHORD),  asked  this question because  I  know of his interest. In fact, I think at  certain times the gentleman despairs of  me.  I  think I know of his  interest in  national defense.  The trilateral  trade system that has  been worked out makes economic sense,  but the FEA admits that the most eco nomic sense it makes is between 50 cents  and $1.1 O per barrel.  .  The most expensive alternative, which  is to use Jones bottomed ships, which, I  might add, would be able to move throu.gh  the Panama Canal, is the most expensive  alternative. That is not mentioning the  cross-Guatemala  pipeline,  the  cross Panama pipeline, the North Tier pipe line, and so forth.  The main point I want to make is that  we  receive our oil,  in essence, by  the  grace of our greenbacks to the OPEC na tions and the fact that there is no Mid east war. We also receive our oil because  of the grace of the Russian NavY not  confusing the issue in the Mediterranean,  which we do not like to think they could  do but they could. We also receive our  on' because of a number of minor things.  For instance, it has been estimated that  the PLO could very quickly and very  easily buy a  surplus torpedo boat and  do in every tanker in the Mediterranean  in a very short period of time.  There are all kinds of contingen~ies  outside of our control which control the  flow of OPEC oil.  If we were to go into this trilateral ar rangement, the FEA admits that our im ports will increase from the OPEC na tions.  To my way of thinking-and I am sure  the gentleman would agree with me- that means that we are even further de pendent in great areas of this country on  OPEC oil, which has a lifeline that none  of us can guarantee for 2 hours.  The gentleman and I cannot guarantee  right now, while we stand here,  that  there is not perhaps a Mideast war pre cipitating. I do not want to see it, but I  have even been working on this issue I  would  to the gentleman for 2 years. I  I  to  the  have said to innumerable people in the  State Department, ""Give me a guarantee,  as  intelligent a guarantee as you can  give me."" No one is certain that there  will not be a Mideast war in 1977 or a  Mideast war in 1978. They do not know.  It seems to me that in the case of each  leader to whom the President talks, on~  is a  little bit happier, one is a little bit  more dubious. I  think that is a strange  way to allow ourselves to be dependent  on foreign oil.  ",1977

176,House,95,-0.023,197,12,Mr. CONTE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to commend my colleagues on the Ad vanced Energy Technologies and Energy  Conservation, Development, and Demon stration Subcommittee of  the Science  and Technology Committee  for  their  adoption of an amendment I was hon ored  to draft and support concerning  the future electrical generation for our  Nation. The amendment, added  to the  Energy Research and Development Ad ministration's proposed fiscal year 1978  authorization, would require the Admin istration  to develop  several small-site  hydroelectric  projects. These  projects  will require  the retrofitting of existing  dams to allow  them to generate up  to  1,000 kilowatts of electricity  for  local  consumption. Recent estimates are that  over 24,000 potential sites exist, where  this new concept of retrofitting an exist ing dam for generation can be applied.  This is a concept I first proposed in tes timony before  the Public Works Sub committee of Appropriations last March.  The cost of such projects are minor as  compared to the proposals for new con struction  that we have  recently  seen.  Also,  the projects do not create addi tional environmental damage as com pared to the construction of these new  mammoth hydroelectric  projects. The  benefits  that can be derived  from  the  con version of  these sites are of great  value to the local communities. For, in  addition  to  supplying  an  additional  amount of power to help with the peak  demands,  the  :i;::otential  restoration of  economic vitality of these once prosper ous communities, makes this an appeal ing concept. The subcommittee  recog nized these potential benefits and auth orized $15 million for the demonstration  of this form of electrical generation. Mr.  Speaker, I belie""{e that this approach is  a far better alternative to the construc tion of some of the proposed hydroelec tric  projects,  such  as  the  proposed  Dickey-Lincoln hydroelectric project on  the St. John River in Maine. This is a  better  approach  from  an  economic  standpoint and from an environmental  standpoint. The conversion time would  be a matter of months, and finally the  potential savings in barrels of oil could  amount to 2 million per day.  Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that this  program will  demonstrate  the  com mercial feasibility of  the future retro fitting of  these small-site dams as a  viable means of providing some of the  Nation's electrical energy in the imme diate future. Once again, I would like  to commend  the members of  the sub committee and in particular Chairman  McCORMACK,  ranking member GOLD WATER, and Representative FISH for their  support in this worthy effort.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION REFORM  The SPEAK.ER. Under a previous or  der of  the House,  the gentleman from  Ohio  (Mr. ASHBROOK)  is recognized for  15 minutes.  ",1977
177,House,95,0.612,197,12,Mr. ASHBROOK.," Mr. Speaker,  the  current procedure for electing the Presi dent and Vice President of the United  States is frequently criticized. I believe  that much of this criticism  is  justified  and that it is time for a major overhaul  of our Presidential election process.  The winner-take-all system,  for ex ample, unfairly gives all of a State's elec tors to the candidate with the most pop ular votes. A candidate receiving only  one vote less than his opponent gets none  of that State's electoral votes.  In addition, people vote  for electors  rather than the candidates themselves.  Not only  is  this somewhat confusing,  there  is  a danger of having renegate  electors. Since an elector chosen by the  people is not bound to vote for the can didate the people choose, a Carter elector  could have voted for Gerald Ford or vice  versa.  Moreover,  there  is  the possibility of  having  the election  thrown  into  the  House of Representatives. One body of  Congress  and  not  the  people would  choose the next President. In this proc ess each State would cast only one vote,  as determined by a majority of Con gressmen within  the State. A heavily  populated State like Ohio would have no  more influence than a sparsely populated  State.  To remedy these defects I have intro duced a bill that would establish a new  procedure for electing the President and  Vice President of the United States. This  legislation would  abolish  the present  Electoral College and end the pra~tice  whereby people vote for_ electors rather  than  the candidates  themselves. In its   place it would substitute an electoral sys tem based primarily on  congressional  districts.  Each State would have a number of  electoral votes  for President and Vice  President equal to the total number of  Senators and Representatives to which  the State is entitled in the Congress.

178,,95,-0.384,223,12,Mr. CHURCH.," Mr. President, on be half of Senator WILLIAMS and myself, I  introduce for appropriate reference a bill  to extend medicare coverage to essential  out-of-hospital prescription drugs.  Inadequate  income  in retirement  is  undoubtedly the No. 1 problem affecting  older Americans. An effective  income  strategy  is,  therefore, essential  to im prove  the economic well-being of  the  aged.  But at the same time, it is vitally im portant to plug up some of the drains  upon the elderly's limited income.  Perhaps the classic example is the high  cost of health care.  Medicare clearly represents. one of the  landmark  legislative  achievements  for  older Americans.  However, hearings conducted by the  Committee on Aging make it abundantly  clear that today-12 years after medi care was enacted into law-medical costs  represent one of  the major worries of  the elderly.  Many Americans  now  believe  that  medicare pays for almost all of the aged's  health  care  costs. Older Americans,  though, know better.  Several crucial gaps  in coverage still  exist. One of the most serious is out-of hospital prescription drugs.  As things now stand, medicare is crisis  oriented.  It provides  reasonably good  coverage for hospitalization. It covers  most prescriptions administered while  patients are hospitalized or confined in a.  nursing home. However, protection is not  available for aged and disabled bene ficiaries requiring medicines on an out patient basis.  This gap in coverage must be closed.  The bill that we introduce today is de signed to broaden medicare coverage to  include out-of-hospital prescriptions for  crippling or life threatening conditions.  This protection, in my judgment, is not  only indispensable for older Americans,  but it is also long overdue.  In 1975, the aged's drug expenditures  exceeded $2.6 billion, or $118 on a. per  capita basis. The overwhelming proportion was paid by the elderly themselves.  ",1977
179,,95,-0.408,249,12,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, there con tinues to be overwhelming popular sup port  for  the  proposed  constitutional  amendment to abolish the electoral col lege and provide for direct popular elec tion of the President and Vice President.  On March 7, 1977, I inserted in the CoN CRESSIONAL RECORD the report of the most  recent Gallup poll. Eighty-four percent  of the American people responding with  an opinion in that poll supported a con stitutional amendment for direct popu lar election of the President.  The support for this long-needed re form is bipartisan. It bas been embraced  by liberals and conservatives alike and  by an overwhelming majority of the peo ple in every region of the country. Among  the organizations which have  taken a  strong position in support of the direct  election amendment are  the American  Bar Association, Chamber of Commerce  of the United States, AFL-CIO, UAW,  League of Women Voters of the United  States, and Common Cause. A number  of other national organizations also have  endorsed direct election,  including  the  American Federation of Teachers,  the  National Small Business Association and  the National Federation of Independent  Business. Recently I was advised that the  American Society for Public Administra tion adopted a  resolution in support of  Senate Joint Resolution 1, the direct elec tion amendment.  The direct election amendment has  been studied thoroughly by members of  the Senate Judiciary Committee during  the past several months and it has been  the subject of widespread public discus sion. Indeed that public discussion has  been continuing for many years. A num ber of years ago I prepared a list of the  10 most frequently asked questions about  direct election of the President and the  answers to those questions. Recently the  League of Women Voters of the United  States worked with the staff of the Sen ate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Con stitution in updating those questions and  answers.  Mr. President, we in the Senate owe  a debt of gratitude  to  the League of  Women Voters. Their study of direct  election  has  been  characteristically  thorough and thoughtful. I would like to  share with the Senate and insert in the  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the questions and  answers on direct election of the Presi dent on which I have been pleased  to  cooperate with  the League of Women  Voters.  I  ask unanimous consent  that  the  questions and answers be printed in the  RECORD.  There being no objection,  the ques tions and answers were ordered  to be  printed in the RECORD, as follows:  QUESTIONS AND A.NSW""E!tS ON DmECT ELECTION  OF THE PRESIDENT  Question 1. Would direct popular election  weaken the two-party system?  Answer. Whatever  the historical  reasons  for the initial appearance of two parties on  the American political scene, most political  scientists are agreed that its continued ex istence is due mostly to the fact that in the  United States political contests are decided  in single-member districts. In other words,  in an election there is but one prize to be  won. The electoral mechanics of the single  member district, in terms of its effect on the  party system, ere such that they tend to force  factions to combine ln order to be certain of  capturing a popular vote plurality and vic tory. Since direct popular election would not  affect the nature of the Presidency, and tt  would remain a. single member office, there ts  little likellhoocl o! direct election splintering  tho parties.  Conversely, the simplest way to splinter the  p1rties would be to offer a. share of power to  !actio:is  in  proportion  to  their  relative  strengths. Direct popular  election, unlike  other proposed changes ln how we elect our  Presidents, would avoid the prospect of mul tiple parties by offering only one prize, thus  malnt:llnlng the incentive to coalesce around  the two major parties.  In addition, S.J. Res. 1 proposes a 40 per cent plurallty requirf'ment as a further safe guard against a proliferation of the parties.  The 40 percent requirement would encourage  potential splinter groups to continue to oper ate within the framework of the two party  system, since no minor party could reasonably  hope to win 40 percent of the total popular  vote. At present, it should be pointed out,  third Parties are encouraged to enter close  Presidential contests in the hope o! playing  a balance of power role-as ln 1948 and a9:aln  in 1968. In S.J. Res. 1, in the unlikely event  of a  runoff. only  the  two  top vote-getters  would participate, which would discourage  in  minor parties from entering the contest, since  it is highly Improbable that they would be  among the top two.  U  splinter parties were to survive under  direct popular election,  it would  become  necessary !or them to expand their political  base and become, in_ effect, national parties.  Tra.d1tlonally,  political  organizations  are  based on state and loco.I foundations. For a  party to have true viability, 1t must be able  to compete !or county sheriff, commissioner,  mayor, congressman and governor, as well  as !or the Presidency.  Direct popular vote can actually strengthen  meaningful grass  roots political organiza tion. Under the present system, there is lit tle incentive to increase the margin o! vic tory or decrease  the margin of defeat  any given state, because a candidate receives  the states entire electoral vote whether the  popular vote margin is one vote or one mil lion. In an election by direct popular vote,  every precinct committee-man in each pa.rty  would know that every extra voto registered  and cast would actually count in the na tional  total. This system would  In reality  increase the incentive to vote and strengthen  meaningful political activity.  Question 2. What effect, 1! any, would di rect popular election have on our  federal  system of government?  Answer. Direct popular elect~on  ls per fectly  consistent with  the  constitutional  principle of federalism, which recognize3 the  dual existence of the states and the national  government as separate entitles. The Presi dency, Witnin this constitutional framework,  ts a national office, and  the President,  in  fact as well as in theory. ls the Chief Execu tive of all the people. Therefore, the choice  of a President should rest with all of the  people.  As former Senator Mike Mansfield pointed  out in a. statement urging the abol!tlon of  the electoral college:  The Federal System  is not strengthened  through an antiquated device which has  not worked as it was intended to work when  it was  included  in  the Constitution and  which,  if anything, has become a  divisive  force in the Federal System by pitting groups  of states against groups o! states. As I  see  the Federal System in contemporary prac tice,  the House of Representatlves  ls  the  key  to  the protection of district  interests  Just as the Senate is the key to the protec tion of State interests.  The3e  instrumentalities, and particularly  the Senate, and the princlpal constitutional  safeguards of-the Federal System, but the  Presidency has evolved, out of necessity, into  the principal political office  .  .    for safe guarding the interests of all  the people in  the states. And sir.ce such is the case ...  the Presidency should be subject to the di rect and equal control of all the people.  Question 3. How would direct popular elec tion affect the distribution of political power  between large states s.nd small states and  between urban voters and rural voters?  Answer. Some spokes:nen for urban Amer ica. have claimed that we should retain the  present electoral system because  it repre sents ""the only effect! ve hold on power that  the urban population centers have  in the  federal government  tcda.y."" On  the other  hand,  some spokesmen  for  rui-al America  have stated that the present electoral vote  formula, which entitles each  state  to as  many electoral votes as it has Senators and  Representatives, inflates the voting power of  the citizens of the smaller states. Such  ts  the dichotomy of the large state-small state  argument. In all fairness. both sides o! this  argument are theoretically correct.  The ratio of electoral votes to population  indicates  that  the  smaller states have  a.  mathematical voting advantage under  present vote torm.ula. embodied in Article II  the  ",1977
180,Senate,95,-0.492,262,12,Mr. METZENBAUM.," Mr. President, as  a member of the Senate Antitrust and  Monopolies Subcommittee, I have  just  attended 3 days of hearings on the status  of our antitrust laws. Quite frankly, the  prognosis is dim. It seems our antitrust  laws have been ineffective in combating  anticompetitive practices which continue  to cost consumers billions of dollars and  result in the inefficient use of our limited  resources. Time and time again, we have  seen grave abuses of the marketplace by  those who produce our energy resources.  Sunday's Washington Post highlighted  a new area where energy producers, al legedly  through  their  foreign  subsidi aries, have subverted our antitrust laws the uranium, or ""yellowcake,"" cartel. The  effect of this cartel has been devastat ing-the world price for yellowcake rose  from $6 a pound to $41, causing at least  one middleman--:-Westinghouse Electric  Corp.-to cancel its contracts with many  public utilities. In the article, William  Greider  raises  some  critical questions  concerning our antitrust iaws:  .  .  What is  the reach of U.S. antitrust  .laws? Both Canada and Australia. en acted new  laws  last y~ar, prohibiting  their uranium companies from supplying  documents in response to the shower of  U.S. subpenas, a matter of national sov eignty, they argued.  On the other hand, in an age where  multinational firms are astride all na tional borders, how much impact do U.S.  antitrust laws really have, if a company  can accomplish through its foreign sub sidiary whatever  it  is prevented  from  doing inside America's borders.  Because of the importance of the ques tions that Mr. Greider raises in his arti cle,  I ask unanimous consent that the  article be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  URANIUM CARTEL, STIRS QUESTIONS OF  ENERGY POLICY  in 1972  ( By William Greider)  The yellowcake cartel began with modest  ambitions for multi-national profit.  An internation.al ""producers' club,"" as they  called themselves, would bring stability and  higher prices to the world trade in yellow cake, the raw uranium which fuels nuclear  power plants.  The club-encouraged by the governments  of Canada, Australia. and South Africa, in spired by major -producers based in France  and Great Britain-set out  to rig  bids and drive prices upward, according to  its own secret records. It divided the market  outside the United States, assigning percent ages to its members.-It put the squeeze on  ""middlemen"" competitors who do not own  their own uranium mines.  But this foreign-based cartel succeeded so  spectacularly in achieving its goal that the  matter is now a billion-dollar legal hassle in  U.S.  courts-and  a  potential  time  bomt>  which could alter the American political de bate over future energy supplies.  While  the  public  was  worrying  over  OPEC's rising oil prices, the world price !or  yellowcake rose even more drastically-from  $6 a pound  to $41. The U.S. market pr1ce  became  fixed  to  the world price. And one  middleman-the Westinghouse Electric Cor poration-was staggered by the consequences.  Westinghouse, unable to fill its urantum supply contra.cts to the public utllities which  buy its nuclear re~tors, canceled them. Now  some  utilities  are  suing  for  damages  which,  theoretically, could exceed a billion  dollars.  In  turn, Westinghouse  is  suing  the 29  multi-natio.nal companies which  it claims  were part of the yellowcake cartel. The Jus tice Department has a grand Jury explortng  the matter in search of criminal violations  of  the U.S. antitrust  laws. A House over sight subcommittee is pouring over hundreds  of secret corporate documents which it had.  subpoenaed for  its own  investigation.  Each issue involves complex economic ar guments over who hurt whom. Some analysts  contend,  for  instance,  that  the cartel had  little impact on uranium prices, that yellow cake was driven up by supply shortages and  the zoom in OPEC oil prices. Others believe  that oil showed yellowcake how it could be  done.  But what turned this foreign-based cartel  into an American controversy is this: some  of  the  alleged  participants  are American  companies, operating through their foreign  subsidiaries. One was Gulf Oil, which is still  17  cleaning up  its corporate  image  from  the  scandal of its illegal $5 million po1itical slush  fund.  Now, if Westinghouse's allegatibns .are sub stantiated, Gulf has another blacl~, eye com ing-the spectacle of  the nation's eighth largest corporation using,  through  its ca~  nadtan subsidiary, the leverage of an inter national cartel to cripple the nation's 20th  largest corporation.  .  To make the drama richer, both Gulf and  Westinghouse are based in Pittsburgh. Their  top executives drink. together at Duquesne  Club,  and  Jerry McAfee,  the  new  board  chairman brought in to clean up Gulf's im age, was president of Gulf Canada when the  cartel manipulations were  arranged. Wes tinghouse, for that matter, is in a peculiar  role as  ""victim,"" since  it has had  its own  share of price-fixing scandals in the past.  Gulf does not deny that it participated in  the cartel, but insists it did nothing to vio late U.S. laws. ""Participation in the carter,""  a  company spokesman  ih Pittsburgh said,  was  through our Canadian subsidiary-at  the stipulation of the Canadlan government.  It was the Canadian government which said,  if you're going  to be a produ( er, you are  going to have to partijipate.""    In the various layers of litigation, however,  Westinghouse has introduced corporate docu ments from Gulf  files  to argue  that Gulf,  among others, was a willing partner and that  it helped block Westinghouse from the uran ium purchases it needed. Other U.S. defend ants include Kerr-McGee, the nation's larg  est uranium producer, and Getty 011 _and  Utah International. .  Gulf attempted last ~eek in U.S. District  court in Washington to block the subpena  of  its  records by Rep. John E. Moss,  (D Calif.) Commerce subcommittee. The House  panel won. The still-secret records are said to  include detailed inquiries from nervous man agers  in Gulf's Canadian subsidiary asking  the home office  to assure  them  that  they  were not getting  themselves  in trouble.  The broader questions raised by the case  go  in several directions, any one of which  could jeopardize the Carter administration's  energy blueprint. For instance:  Is the world price of uranium still subject  to manipulation by a global cartel? I! so, that  could add another argument against rapid  development of nuclear power in the United  States, a development implicit in President  Carter's energy plans.  Westinghouse insists the cartel  is still in  place, but went underground  after prices  soared, no longer needed  to arrange rigged  bidding. The  government  of Canada  an nounced last fall that it withdrew from the  ""informal marketing arrangements"" in 1975.  One market  analyst  dubbed  the  cartel  ""UPEC,"" and suggested that future increases  in uranium prices are possible. Others argue  that the cartel was formed mainly in retalia tion against the U.S. embargo which closed  the American market to foreign producers.  Now that the U.S. embargo is being phased  out, a foreign cartel has no further purpose.  At the moment, in fa.ct, some Europeans are  fuming about the possibllity of an American led cartel in the future.  What is the reach of U.S. antitrust laws?  Both Canada and Australia enacted new laws  last year, prohibiting  their uranium com panies from supplying documents in response  to the shower of U.S. subpoenas. A matter of  national sove-reignty, they argued.  On the other hand, in an age when multi national firms are a.stride all national borders,  how much  impact do U.S. antitrust  laws  really have,  company can accomplish  through its foreign subsidiary whatever it is  prevented  from  doing  inside  America's  borders?  Finally, in terms of current political sen timent,  the yellowcake cartel may provoke  more congressional interest in questions of  if a   ",1977

182,,95,-0.443,392,12,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I wel come the Carter administration's respon sible and progressive proposals for deal ing with a problem that must be solved the financial difficulties of the social se curity system.  Obviously, there are a variety of pos sible approaches  to this complex issue.  Perhaps Congress can improve on the de tails of the Carter proposals. But I be lieve the administration has avoided some  of the most serious objections that have  plagued past effom, such as the Ford  administration's unwise proposal in 1976  for an immediate increase in the payroll  tax rate, which would have heavily bur dened low and middle income workers.  I have long supported a general rev enue contribution to social security as a  way of easing the burden of the regres sive payroll  tax and dealing with  the  shortfall in the trust funds caused by the  severe recession and slow recovery of re cent years. By adopting  this approach  the Carter administration has taken an  important and long overdue step toward  a more equitable method of financing the  social security system.  According to economists, both the em ployer's arid the employee's share of the  payroll tax is borne by workers. It is a  fallacy to argue that the tax will come  out of business profits, or that it dis criminates unfairly against business. The  approach taken by the administration is  simply a way of healing the system and  'preventing future deficits, without  the  imbalance that would occur in the cur rent benefit structure if the past 50-50  ratio of the employer's and employee's  share were to be retained.  I do have some concern over where the  general revenues will come from to pay  the social security contributions, espe cially  in  light of  the administration's  concern for a balanced budget in the  future. But  the first general  revenue  allocation will be only about $3 billion  and will not be made until 1979. Thus,  the amount involved is modest"" and will  have no serious immediate impact on our  current problems of inflation or unem ployment. The program is gradual, and  it is also well designed to solve the social  security problem, without producing a  setback to the current national economic  recovery and without making the current  payroll tax more regressive.  In recent months, there has been too  much scare talk about these problems.  The social security system is sound, and  both Congress and the administration are  determined to keep it that way. There  are shortrun and longrun challenges we  have to face. The proposals of the Carter  administration are a major step toward  a responsible and fair solution. They deserve a better reception than they have  received so far, and I hope that Congress  will act quickly on them.  (This concludes additional statements  submitted today.)

191,,95,0.739,496,12,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, in the past  few months, the call for airline deregu lation has increased tremendously. Legis lation has been introduced and the pos sibility of this legislation passing has be come almost inevitable.  In recent hearings held before the Sen ate Subcommittee on Aviation, feelings  expressed by those testifying have been  mixed, some presenting material against  deregulation, others fully recommending  the passage of airline deregulation legis lation.  One of the groups in favor of less regu lation is United Airlines. United supports  a new Federal aviation law to increase  competition gradually and reduce Gov ernment regulation of the air transport  industry.  In the May 10th issue of the Wash ington Post, Richard J. Ferris, respected  president of United Airlines,  incisively  explains in his letter to the editor why  deregulation is desirable.  The article follows:  LET AIRLINES COMPETE IN THE MATKETPLACE  Your April 9 editorial ""Airlines and Free  Enterprise""  twits  the U.S. airline  industry  for opposing regulatory reform proposals now  pending  in Congress. You express surprise  that airlines haven't leaped at the opportu nity  to attain less regulation and you say  ""airlines a.re merely seeking to _stay with the  crowd.""  United Airlines  is one carrier (and there  are some others) that hasn't stayed with the  crowd, that has been outspoken in support  of  less regulation, and that has called for  market-oriented management risk-taking to  meet the desires of our boss-the customer.  United Airlines  supports a  new  federal  aviation law to  increase competition grad ually and reduce government regulation of  the air-transport industry. A new law that  gradually increases market influence and re duces government influence will benefit both  passengers and the air-transport system.  For  the  passenger,  regulatory  change  would mean continuation of a  sound air   transport system and the benefits of innova tion and efficiency that the marketplace de mands of sellers. It wo µld mean service even  to market demand more closely  tailored  better tailored regarding price, frequency of  flights, and variety and quality of service.  For airlines, regulatory change would per mit better matching of prices and costs for  a reasonable profit. Under the current regu latory framework,  the airline industry's 3.6  per cent return on total capital over a 5year period put it last among 30 industries- including  the  railroads-in Forbes maga zine's latest survey. Unless that return im proves, airlines will not attract enough pri vate capita.I  to replace obsolescent aircraft  and  accommodate  growth.  In  that  case,  either the air-transport system wm deteri orate or government capital wm be required.  Gradual  transition  to a market  system  would avoid the possibility of wholesale dis ruotion of the air-transport system. A grad ual  change would helo  ensure  continued  stable employment in the industry.  What we recommend ls simply this: Let  airlines  use  th0ir  resources, management  to compete  skllls and marketing acumen  FAULTY LOGIC BEHIND CONSUMER  AGENCY  HON. WILLIS D. GRADISON, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 11, 1977  ",1977
192,,95,0.233,496,12,Mr. GRADISON.," Mr. Speaker, among  the proposals which seem to continually  reappear before Congress, is the idea of  a Federal ""Agency for Consumer Protec tion""-ACP. Once again we are faced  with a proposal, H.R. 6805, which would  establish such an agency. The premise  for  creating  a  Consumer Protection  Agency is based on faulty logic, and this  proposal would cause numerous prob lems.  Everyone agrees that existing depart ments and agencies are not doing an  adequate Job of protecting consumers.  This is not, however, due to a disregard  for the needs and views of consumers.  Rather, this is a consequence of ineffi cient decisionmaking processes which  have produced unforeseen and sometimes  catastrophic results.  The question  then becomes how  to  most effectively remedy this situation. It  seems illogical to me, to attempt to rem edy the inefficiency of existing agencies  by creating a  new  agency. Such an  agency will not only be afflicted with the  problems of the existing agencies, but  in addition will cause increased confu sion, delay, and consequent dissatisfac tion.  Proponents of this legislation feel that  this agency would advocate the interests  and views of consumers to other agen cies and departmen~.  to balance  the  lobbying influence of groups represent ing special interests. Such a view fails  to acknowledge that the basic purpose of  every Federal agency or department is  to decide what is best for the citizens of  our country, the consumers.  The sensible solution to this problem  is to reform the existing agencies, rather  than adding a new one. If the problem  is a lack of consumer represenation, re forms should be made with each agency  to insure that consumers' interests are  given primary consideration. If there are  other problems,  these also  should be  solved by altering an agency's structure.  Some have argued that while regula tory reform of this nature is desirable, it  simply has not come about. However, it  is a lack of consumer representation, re curred. Congress is responsible for over seeing agencies and assuring their eff ec tiveness, but has been remiss in carrying  out this duty. I feel that we should be gin to exercise our proper responsibilities  instead of passing off this function to a  new agency.  The creation of an Agency for Con sumer Protection  assumes  that  consumers have some type of consensus of  their objectives. needs, and preferences.  In reality, such agreement hardly ever  exists. To ascertain what is best for con sumers,  the ACP would often have to  reconcile the competing preferences of  various groups of consumers. The ACP  would  thus  utilize  a  decision.making  process similar to that of existing agen cies, rather than advocating an obvious  consumer viewpoint as many of  this  agency's proponents expect.  The cost of an Agency for Consumer  Protection should not be  ignored. The  estimated price of such an agency fails  to take account of increases in both the  paperwork burden of businesses and the  additional costs of regulation caused by  such bureaucratic infighting. All of these  costs are eventually paid by the consumer  in the form of higher prices and taxes.  Instead of establishing this new agen cy, Congress should face up to the prob lem squarely and bring agencies which  have gotten out of hand back under con trol. Passage of legislation establishing  the ACP would constitute an admission  to the American people that Congress  can no longer control the agencies it has  created.  THE JOHN P. SAYLOR PARK  HON. JOHN P. MURTHA  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 11, 1977  ",1977
193,,95,-0.265,496,12,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker,  it was  my pleasure early this month to join in  the dedication of the John P. Saylor Park  in Black Lick, Pa.  I know many of my colleagues remem ber the late John Saylor. Many of you  also recall his former aide, Harry Fox,  who is now chairman of the county com missioners in Armstrong County. Harry  was another of the principal speakers at  the program.  The park is a 96-acre site. Land for the  park was donated by the Rochester &  Pittsburgh Coal Co. Money for the proj ect also came from the Bureau of Out door Recreation.  During  the 200-year history of  the  U.S. Congress, no  individual has done  more for sportsmen and conservation ists than John P. Saylor. He sponsored  numerous legislation which has left its  mark on the environmental progress of  the Nation. He was the first Member of  Congress  to receive the National Park  Association Award. He was named Con servationist of, the Year by the National  Wildlife Federation and  the Pennsyl vania Outdoor Writers Association. He  also won the Gold Medal of the Penn sylvania State Fish and Game Commis sion.  There is no more fitting mark to his  memory than this park which can help  the Black Lick area residents to enjoy  and appreciate the outdoors.  I would like to include for the RECORD  some of the comments from the news paper story which appeared in the May 2  Indiana Evening Gazette concerning the  dedication:  ",1977
194,,95,-0.212,509,12,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr. Speaker, during the  last session of Congress, I made a state ment applauding  the decision of  the  House Interior Committee to table H.R.  1863, the coal slurry pipeline bill. That  bill,  if enacted, would have bestowed  Private developers with the power to con demn private lands for the purpose of  building a coal slurry pipeline more than  1,000 miles long.  Today, we are facing the issue again  with the pending legislation, H.R. 1609,  the Coal Pipeline Act of 1977. Recently,  it has come to my attention that the Fed eral Energy Administration may soon  endorse  the  legislation with additional  amendments designed to protect agricul tural water rights on the Northern Great  Plains.  I have expressed my opposition of the  bill  to Federal Energy Administrator  O'Leary. It is my fear that if the Carter  administration supports the legislation,  the major provisions of the bill would be  enacted but the environmental amend ments would be lost in the shuffle.  The diversion of vast quantities of  water  from  an  arid,  and  this  year  drought-ridden region, is ludicrous. The  Northern Great Plains  is already be ginning to experience wide-scale envi ronmental impact as a result of coal de velopment. Enactment of the Coal Pipe line Act would add insult to injury.  I would like to identify today, for the  benefit of my colleagues, several impor tant points  regarding  the slurry con troversy and to bring to their attention  to some of the implications of the bill.  BACKGROUND  U.S. coal production totaled 665 mil lion tons in 1976, an increase of 2.6 per cent over 1975. However,  the National  Coal Association estimates a smaller in crease for coal production in 1977. Be tween 665-672 million tons of coal is ex pected to be mined. The smaller increase  is due to the recent cold weather, flood ing, and a possible strike later this year  by the United Mineworkers.  Of the coal produced in 1975, railroads  transported about 64.5 percent from the  mine, barges carried 10.7 percent, trucks  moved 12.2 percent, and 11.3 percent was  moved by conveyor belt or truck to mine mouthed generating plants. These fig ures compare with 67.1 percent, 11.6 per cent, 9.7 percent, and 10.9 percent re spectively in 1973.  The railroad tariff in 1974 accounted  for about 23 percent of the delivered cost  of  coal  shipped-mine value of  coal  shipped by rail was 6.0 billion in 1974.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Projections by the National Coal As sociation in studies made for  the FEA  and DOT indicate that coal production  could double to between 1.2 and 1.5 bil lion tons by 1985. This dramatic increase  will have serious  implications  for  the  transportation  industry as  the various  transportation modes  compete  for  a  share of the market. The Nation's be leaguered railroad network sees coal as  her future salvation in light of generally  declining railroad traffic and other com modities. This hope has been somewhat  dimmed by the prospect of a new com petitor in the coal transportation mar ket-the coal slurry pipeline.  Mr. Speaker, I would now like to focus  on the advent of the slurry pipeline, com pare  its economic and environmental  impacts with rail transportation and to  make my recommendations on this im portant issue.  THE ISSUE  The most recent evidence of the slurry  railroad struggle over coal shipment is  still the proposal by Energy Transporta tion Systems,  Inc.-ETSI-to build a  1,030-mile coal slurry pipeline from Gil lette, Wyo.,  to Pine Bluff, Ark. Both  the Nation's largest construction engi neering firms, and Lehman Brothers, one  of Wall  Street's  largest  investment  houses, own a 40-percent share of ETSI.  The remaining 20 percent is owned by  Kansas Nebraska Natural Gas Co.  of  Phillipsburg, Ka.ns.  The proposed pipeline would have a  38-inch diameter with a capacity of ap proximately 25 million tons of coal per  year. Arkansas Power & Light Co., a sub sidiary of Middle South Utilities, Inc., is  a principal plan purchaser of the coal.  Unfortunately for ETSI, the proposed  pipeline 1ight-of-way crosses beneath  the tracks of 9 railroads at 48 points. Of  these nine railroads, only Missouri Pa cific has granted the necessary permits.  The remaining  railroads have  refused  permits to prevent the slurry competi tion.  To overcome this opposition, ETSI is  seeking governmental help. H.R. 1609,  sponsored by Congressman ECKHARDT of  Texas, amends the Mineral Leasing Act  of 1920, to authorize the Secretary of In terior to grant rights-of-way over Fed eral  lands  to operators of coal slurry  pipelines. It authorizes any carrier of  coal by pipeline  to acquire necessary  rights-of-way by exercising the power of  eminent domain  if acquisition cannot  be made through negotiation.  Power of eminent domain may be ex ercised only by a carrier holding a certif icate of public convenience and neces sity-C.P .C. & M.-issued by the Depart ment of the Interior. The granting of  eminent domain would enable ETSI to  get the necessary right-of-way over the  private lands held by the railroads and  individuals.  It surprises me that  this bill would  receive serious consideration by Congress  when the Congressional Office of Tech nology Assessment-OTA-is currently  in the process of completing an objective  study of the coal slurry pipeline trans portation. That study will be completed  by January 1978. I think it is important  14439  for Congress  to  consider  the  recom mendations of that study before making  a decision on this issue.  There are other important aspects of  this issue that I would like to bring to  the attention of my colleagues.  UNFAIR COMPETITION  Congress  almost  certainly  has  the  power to grant the right of eminent do main  to slurry pipelines. Natural gas  pipelines were granted eminent domain  in the 1947 amendment of the Natural  Gas Act; oil pipelines received the right  during World War II under the war pow ers of  the Cole Act; and hydroelectric  projects are licensed to use the power by  the FPC.  The railroads, which have the right of  eminent domain, are required by law to  be common carriers. This means  that  they must make their services available  to anyone willing to pay their tariff. The  ETSI pipeline will have no such obliga tions. The proposed slurry pipeline  is  contracted to carry 25 million tons of coal  a year for 30 years to Middle South Utili ties. The pipeline will have no excess  capacity to accommodate additional cus tomers. Thus the pipeline is essentially  servicing the needs of a single coal com pany and a single utility company.  The granting to ETSI of a public power  such as eminent domain for a private  good  is a bad  legislative precedent. It  also unfairly discriminates against  the  railroads which must service all custom ers regardless of profitability while free ing slurry pipelines to handle the large  volume,  lucrative routes. Railroads are  thus placed at a competitive disadvan tage in that they must charge higher  tariffs on all their lines to compensate  for marginal common carrier operations.  To insure fair competition among com peting  transportation modes  and  to  justify the granting of a public privilege,  slurry pipelines should be  required  to  have access capacity to accommodate ad ditional customers. Yet the transfer of  the flow of slurry to another destination  would force an idling of the Middle South  plant and  thus drastically  alter  the  economics of the project.  ECONOMIC COMPARISON  There have been three major studies  comparing  the  relative  economics  of  shipping coal by slurry pipeline and rail road-Bechtel's  ""The Energy  Supply  Planning Model; The Coal Future"" de veloped at the Center for Advanced Com putation-CAC-at  the University  of  Illinois; and ""The Research Analysis of  Factors Affecting the Transportation of  Coal by Rail and Slurry Pipelines"" by  the Hudson  Institute. The  first  two  studies both  :financed by NSF grants,  reached conflicting conclusions as to the  cost of railroad transportation. The last  study, financed by Burlington Northern,  concluded that pipelines cannot consist ently transport coal more cheaply than  unit trains.  The Bechtel study was based on a com puter model which projected that the  proposed Wyoming-Arkansas  pipeline  could transport coal more cheaply than  can railroads. The validity of this study  is being questioned in light of Bechtel's  40 percent ownership of ETSI. A Sen ate Interior Subcommittee, chaired by  ",1977
195,,95,-0.298,522,12,Mr. KOSTMAYER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to ask my colleagues  to support  new legislation, H.R. 6403, which would  add 114 miles of the Dela ware River be tween New York, Pennsylvania, and New  Jersey  to  the Wild and Scenic Rivers  System.  I have sent the following letter to my  colleagues describing my bill and asking  for support and cosponsorship:  DEAR  COLLEAGUE:  Recently  I  introduced  H.R. 6403  to add an approximately 114-mile  section of the Delaware River  to the Wild  and Scenic Rivers System.  Part ::,f the Dela ware affected by this leg islation, a 75-mile segment between Hancock,  New Ycrk and Matamoras, Pennsylvania has  already been  the subject of an  intensive  federal-state study commissioned by the Bu reau of Outdoor Recreation. The study con cluded  this stretch of the Delaware quali fied as scenic and recreational, should be in cluded in the Wild and Scenic Rivers System,  and could be protected and managed with  minimum public investment and little dis ruption of the area.  The five-year cost estimate including land  acquisition and development of fac111ties  is  a modest $3.8 million.  The  lower 39 miles of the Delaware cov ered in this bill run from Port Jervis, New  York to the Delaware Water Gap. Almost all  of this portion of the river lies within the  boundaries of ihe Dela.ware Water Gap Na tional Recreation Area. As you may know,  this section of the river would become a lake  if  the Dela ware were  to be  impounded by  the proposed Tocks Island Dam.  By adding  this portion of  the Delaware  to  the Wild and Scenic system, Congress  would foreclose the possibility of the Tocks  Island Dam while ensuring the public's en joyment of a  free-flowing river within the  National Recreation Area.  Environmental studies of  the area  indi cate that the Tocks Island project would re sult in the loss of more than 20,000 acres  of wildlife habitat, hundreds of historic and  archaeological sites, and the rural character  of the entire region. A free-flowing river is  essential to the preservation of the quality  of life in this area and I invite your co-spon sorship of H.R. 6403.  Sincerely,  im the  Mr. Speaker, I  feel  the issue of  Delaware's future  is  particularly  portant at this time because Saturday,  May 14 is the date of a canoe trip spon sored by the Save the Delaware Coalition  on  that part of  the  river which  is  threatened by the Tocks Island Dam, but  which would remain free-flowing under  my bill. The coalition, consisting of 61  civic and environmental organizations,  opposes the Tocks Island Dam, but sup ports preservation and enhancement of  the historic,  scenic,  and  recreational  values of the Delaware Valley.  I share with my colleagues  the fol lowing facts as compiled by the Save the  Delaware Coalition:  THE DELAWARE RIVER: A MATl'ER OF LIFE--OR  DEATH  A MATTER OF LIFE  The free flowing Dela ware  ls alive today.  Fr9m the Catsk111 Mountains in New York to  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tidewater, some 265 miles downstream, the  river and its valley, the fertile Minisink, ls  alive with fish, wildlife, history, archaeology  and  boundless  recreational  opportunities.  But tomorrow, it may be dead.  A MATTER OF DEATH  A  threat has  loomed over  the Delaware  since 1962 when Congress  authorized  the  Corps of Engineers to build a 160 foot high  earthen dam at Tocks Island, five miles above  the legendary Delaware Water Gap. The dam  would create a 37 mile long slack water im poundment  subject  to  siltation,  terminal  pollution and-the ultimate death of  the  Delaware.  AN OPPORTUNITY  After  completion  of  a  Congressionally  mandated study,  the Delaware River Basin  Commission  ( consisting of the governors of  N.Y., Pa., N.J. and Delaware and the federal  Secretary of the Interior) voted against con struction of the dam on July 31, 1975. The  Council on Environmental Quality, the En vironmental Protection Agency and even the  Corps of Engineers then recommended that  Congress deauthorize the project. Congress woman Mlllicent Fenwtck  (N.J.), Congress woman Helen Meyner  (N.J.). and Senator  Clifford P. Case  (N.J.) have now introduced  bllls to deauthorize the Tocks Dam.  Deauthorization would create  the oppor tunity to develop a master land use plan to  realize the area's recreational paten tial while  preserving its natural character.  Meaningful planning for the entire regi9n  ls deterred so long as the Tocks Dam remains  on the Congressional books. It is time, there fore, to deauthorize the dam and get on with  the necessary planning. Until this ls done,  the Tocks Island region can experience only  continued chaos, confusion and controversy.  WHY THE TOCKS DAM?  Impetus for th-; dam came from the freak  flooding of the Delaware in 1955, when hurri canes Connie and Diane struck in rapid suc cession. The dam was also intended to pro vide water supply and hydroelectric power.  Recreation was added in 1965 with author ization for the Delaware Water Gap National  Recreation Area (DWGNRA) covering 72,000  acres in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.  WHAT WOULD BE DESTROYED?  Irreplaceable losses which could be saved  without Tocks include: the free flowing Dela ware, more than 20,565 acres of wildlife ha.b i ta. t  and  flooded  recreational and historic  areas, numerous species of wildlife, an excel lent game fishery and shad run, hundreds of  historic sites and structures, more than 100  known archaeological sites,  including evi dence of Paleo-Indian culture as early as  10,000 B.C., a rich variety of vegetation and,  finally, the quiet rustic character of the en tire  region,  which would  be  drastically  changed by the influx of 10.6 mlllion annual  visitors and resulting degradation.  Why  the Tocks Dam is unnecessary?  FLOOD CONTROL  The key to flood control 1s flood plain man agement. Less  than 22% of the 1955 flood  damages occurred in areas which Tocks woUld  protect. The dam would protect against 60 %  of the potential damage but flood plain man agement 78% or 18% more. Tocks :flood con trol costs would be $74 mllllon but flood  plain management only $17 mllllon or $57  million less. Moreover, flood plain manage ment ls environmentally sound.  WATER S'OPPLY  Water supply needs can be feasibly met by  high flow skimming using New Jersey's Round  Valley Reservoir, alternative sources 1n N.J.  and N.Y.,  and  recycling and conservation  measures. The need for low flow augmenta tion to protect the Philadelphia and Camden  water supplies from salt intrusion is ""sub stantially discounted"" by a recent study for  the Corps of Engineers. In any event, the  May 11, 1977  study concludes that tlie Philadelphia intake  can be moved upstream and Camden has  alternative supplies.  ELECTRIC POWER  Hydroelectric power with a  firm capacity  of only 38 MW would be minimal. Although  not an authorized purpose of the Tocks Proj ect, a  related pumped storage  faclllty  to  provide peaking power  is planned on Kit tatlnny Ridge which would destroy sections  of the Appalachian Trail, Worthington State  Park and threaten Sunfish Pond, a pristine  glacial lake and registered National Natural  Landmark. Requiring 3 KW of power to gen erate only 2, pumped storage would be the  main cause of daily water level fluctuations,  turbidity,  situation,  and  temperature  changes. Combined cycle combustion  tur bines and peak  load pricing are  feasible  al terna ti ves.  RECREATION  The  splendid  recreational potential can  be realized  in greater variety and quality  without Tocks. Construction of  the dam  would seriously threaten recreational qual ity, particularly swimming, boating and fish ing  because  the  reservoir would  become  polluted due to excess eutrophication. Water  level  changes would  leave debris Uttered  mudflats instead of the clear water expected.  The  irreplaceable  losses  previously  listed  would further limit the potential q,uallty and  variety of  recreation. Adverse  impacts of  10.6 milllon annual visitors could be devas tating. Annual visits per gross acre at Tocks  would be 169  times Yellowstone, which  ls  31  times  larger  than Tocks, and 47  times  Yosemite, which  ls 11  times  larger  than  Tocks.  EUTROPHICATION  Numerous studies have confirmed that the  Tocks Reservoir woUld become rapidly pol luted through excess eutrophlcation. Drain age of agricultural effluent from the upper  Delaware  estimated as  the equivalent of  sewage  from  a  city of 400,000  cannot be  identified, collected and treated like munic ipal  sewage  because  it  ls not discharged  through pipes but drains over and through  the soil  itself. Not a  serious problem now  because  the  river  ls  free  flowing,  these  effluents would become concentrated in the  relatively stagnant reservoir which acts as  a sink. Rapid growth of algae, loss of game  fish and serious degradation of  the  recre ational potential ls expected to follow.  ECONOMICS  Justlftcatlon on economic grounds 1s stlll  questionable.  Initial cost estimates of $90  mllllon  have  escalated  to  $400 mllllon.  Former CEQ Chairman, Russell Peterson and  others estimated cost at $1 bllllon. As re quired by Federal law, benefits must equal  costs. At an unrealistic interest rate of SYs %,  the Army Engineers' latest benefit cost ratio  ls 1.6 which more recent studies calculate  between minus 0.66 and 2.48. The shifting  benefit cost ratio and appllcatlon of ques tionable factors indicate that costs may well  exceed benefits. Claims that the Tocks Proj ect wm  stimulate  economic development  and employment are also  tenuous as dis closed by recent studies of similar projects  showing  that more employment could be  provided by applying the same funds to more  productive purposes.  Mr. Speaker, I think it should also be  noted  that when  a majority of  the  Govemors  comprising  the Delaware  River Basin Commission voted in 1975  against construction of the dam,  they  did so after an exhaustive study of the  dam and its alternatives had been com pleted. The President's Council on En vironmental Quality and the Environ mental Protection Agency  both  sub mitted  their views  the Govemors  to  ",1977
196,House,95,0.247,535,12,Mr. WINN.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the gentleman from Michigan for yield ing to me. I also rise in support of H.R.  6714 which is known, of course, to all of  us as the International Development and  Food Assistance Act of 1977.  As the chairman of the full committee,  the  gentleman  from Wisconsin  <Mr.  ZABLOCKI) said this bill would authorize  a  total of $1.7 billion dollars for U.S.  self-help development  assistance pro grams for  the people of some of  the  neediest countries in the international  community for fiscal year 1978, as well  as making certain amendments to Pub lic Law 480.  H.R. 6714 authorizes programs which  are addressed to fundamental problem  areas  faced  by  development nations.  More than a third of the funds author ized by the bill are allocated for rural  development and increasing agricultural  productivity. There is virtually no one  who is not yet aware of the serious world  food problem. The emphasis in this leg islation on self-help programs  to  in crease the agricultural productivity of  the small farmers who make up such a  large segment of the needy majorities  in developing nations is a necessary as pect of achieving long-term solutions to  the debilitating and destabilizing prob lems of hunger and malnutrition.  The bill also authorizes funds for im portant development programs  in  the  areas of population, health, education,  technical assistance, and disaster relief,  among others. Population and health are  closely interrelated matters affecting de velopment. Without  the promotion of  effective population planning efforts by  developing  countries,  continued  rapid  population growth will just tend to offset  progress in areas such as increasing per  capita food production.  Obviously,  poor  health  conditions  which are principally manifested by high  rates of infant mortality make it more  difficult for the poor in developing coun tries to convince themselves of the im portance of population planning. Ironi do begin to bear fruit, there often seems  to be a persistent lag in commencing  cally, of course, when health programs  . population planning programs. This lag  coupled with the declining death rates  arising from successful health programs  further exacerbates population growth  problems for a period of time. One im portant health program will direct ef fects on development which H.R. 6714  will support is the U.S. contribution to  the multidonor program to wipe out the  serious disease problem of river blind ness in a number of the West African  countries. Eradication of this hazard will  allow resettlement and argicultural de velopment of some large relatively fertile  areas in Mali, Ghana, Upper Volta, Ivory  Coast, Niger, Togo, and Benin.  This legislation will help to promote  the development of appropriate energy  resources  in  recipient countries. H.R.  6714 earmarks funds for research, devel opment, and the use of renewable, small scale energy sources specifically appro priate to agricultural and rural devel opment needs. Similarly,  the bill con tains technical assistance funds to help  encourage developing countries to con centrate on nonnuclear energy sources.  Such programs are essential in view of  the fact that developing countries have  suffered the most from the enormous in creases in oil prices.  One section of R.R. 6714 which I con sider significant is the provision dealing  with women in development. This sec tion recognizes that women constitute a  significant human resource for enhanc ing development efforts. Unfortunately,  U.S. assistance programs have often given  insufficient  attention  to  integrating  women  in to the national economies of  developing countries. Thus, our aid pro grams have under-utilized the potential  for further enhancing  recipient coun tries' overall development inherent in the  more effective participation of women.  H.R. 6714 would encourage AID to give  greater attention to implementing devel opment assistance projects, programs,  and activities which will better achieve  this integration.  Title II of  this  legislation makes a  number of worthwhile amendments  to  Public Law 480. Among the most signifi cant is the one authorizing the inclusion  of high protein, blended and fortified  foods  in title I concessional sales pro grams. This section is particularly im portant to those poor countries whose  level of programs toward economic self sufflciency is enabling them to begin the  transition  from  title  II humanitarian  grant programs toward title I conces sional sales. Second, I feel the provision  of the committee's bill to increase the  minimum tonnage of commodities for the  title II humanitarian grants is commend able. An  increase  to 1.6 million  tons  from the present minimum of 1.3 mil lion tons is provided for. Much of these  commodities go into needed material and  child health programs administered by  private,  nonprofit  voluntary  agencies  such as CARE and Catholic Relief Serv ices.  I have not adequately addressed all of  the good features of this legislation in  the interest of conserving time. However,  in conclusion, I want to point out that  H.R. 6714 may be justified by considerations of U.S. self-interest in addition to  the obvious humanitarian  reasons.  It  should be apparent to any prudent per son that continued U.S. prosperity is in creasingly closely related to development  of Third World countries and the in creased stability which  the benefits of  that development imply. That increased  stability and progress in the developing  world directly reduces the risk of out breaks and international conflicts  into  which the United States may be drawn.  These improved conditions should hope fully also help  to provide a more ra tional and reliable basis for U.S. access  to raw materials and offer expanded mar kets for U.S. exports. In light of the above  considerations, I would encourage pas sage of H.R. 6714.  ",1977

199,House,95,-0.306,535,12,Mr. RAHALL.," I want to congratulate,  Mr. Chairman, the chairman of the com mittee and the members of that commit tee for their long and hard work on this  bill. I have agonized long over this bill,  Mr. Chairman, and find many features of  it that I fully agree with in helping the  poor in the underdeveloped countries and  in the developing countries.

In February of this year, the unem ployment rate of our country was 7.5  percent. In Newark, N.J., unemployment  stood at 16 percent;  in New York City,  10.4 percent; in Oakland, 12.8 percent;  in St. Louis, 11.4 percent; in Detroit, 11.6  percent.

In pure and simple  terms,  those as tonishingly high unemployment figures  tell us  that, while the recession might  technically no longer be with us, the ef fects of that recession are still very much  with us. Those people without jobs don't  care what the textbook definition says  about recession. They know what their  pocketbook says and  their pocketbook  says that hard times are still very much  a part of America's economic picture.

206,,95,-0.418,652,12,Mr. MOAKLEY.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like  to commemorate  today  the 35th  birthday of local 718 of the International  Association of Fire Fighters in Boston,  Mass.  This union was -started on April 17,  1942, at the Hotel Bradford, with 300  signatures from  firefighters across  the  Boston area. Membership quickly rose to  600 and loyalty has remained strong in  this group until today.  its beginning,  local  718 worked  hard  to combat  long hours and  low  wages and poor working conditions of  Boston  firefighters.  It overcame much  opposition  from  company  officers  communicate with fellow workers and  promote fair treatment of their fell ow  members.  It  slowly  accomplished  its  membership's goals of better working  conditions and adequate wages, never  forgetting that public service is the basis  of the firefighter's work for society.  Early critics predicted that the union  would not last 6 months, but hard work  and close cooperation with city officials  led to a strong and healthy group. The  late Honorable Maurice J. Tobin; Fire  Commissioner W1lliam A. Reilly, and  Chief of Department Samuel Pope all  helped to build local 718 and thus to bet ter the lot of the Boston firefighter.  Today, local 718 ts a model of responsi ble  self-organization. Members  serve  their union nnd the Boston public with  great distinction. I am proud to mark  the 35th anniversary of local 718's dedi cation to the Boston community.  May 12, 1977  FACING HAVANA AND HANOI WITH OUT IFF  HON. EDWARD J.

For this reason, it is im Portant that we share information on  programs that are achieving results in  these fields.  The State of Maryland had been very  active in these areas under the leader ship of Commissioner of Labor and In dustry Harvey A. Epstein. For the inf or mation of my colleagues, I ask unani mous consent  to have printed  in  the  RECORD excerpts from Commissioner Ep stein's  comprehensive  report  on  the  Maryland  occupational  safety  and  health program.  There being no objection, the excerpts  were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  MARYLAND 0cCUPATJ:ONAL SAFETY AND  HEALTH PROGRAM'.  HISTORICAL BACKGROUND  The Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety  and Heal,th Act of 1970 charged the U.S. De partment of Labor with  the responsiblllty  of establishing a. program assuring ""so far  as possible every working man and woman in  the nation, safe and healthful working con ditions,  and  preserving  our human  re sources.""  Congress  included  in the Act of 1970 a  provision under Section 18 (b) ""for any sta.te  at 18,lly  time, that desires to assume the re sponsibiliity  for development and enforce ment of a  state occupational safety and  health program, may elect to do so.""  In March 1971, Governor Marvin Mandel  designated.  the Division of Labor and In dustry as rthe responsible agency to develop  and  admini'Ster Maryland's Occupational  Safety and Health Pl,a.n  in accordance with  Section 18(b)  of  the Occupational Sa.fety  and Health Act of 1970.  In December  1972, Maryland's develop mental plan for Occupational Safety and  Health was submitted to the U.S. Depart ment of La.bor for approval. In anticipation  of approval of the plan, the Maryland Legis lature, during its 1973 session, passed en abling legislaition, Article 89, Section 28-49A  of the Annotated Code of Maryland, estab lishing  the Maryland Occupational Safety  and Health Act.

228,,95,-0.419,834,12,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. Speaker,  there  indeed a great deal of work to be done in  the area of welfare reform where no easy  solutions can be found. Moreover, in any  uniform welfare  system,  high-benefit  States such as Hawaii must be given  special consideration.  I would  like  to  share with my colleagues an editorial  which appeared in the Honolulu Star Bulletin on May 7, 1977, dealing with  welfare reform:  WELFARE REFORM MUST BE DONE CAREFULLY  During his election campaign, Jimmy Car ter said that cities should not be burdened  with the cost of welfare and that the federal  government  should eventually  absorb  the  welfare costs borne by state governments as  well.  But in his welfare presentation Monday  the Preeident didn't refer  to  those points.  Nor was there any convincing explanation as  to how a uniform system of national bene fits could be provided without cutting aid to  high-benefit states.  A national welfare system is an attractive  idea: the present system, everyone agrees, is  a complicated mess.  That much said, the problem remains o!  creating a viable new system. The President,  having imposed a deadline on himself to an nounce a. plan by May 1, discovered that the  problem was tar from simple and confined his  presentation to general principles.  Hawaii is at the top of the list in state  spending on poor residents, with a 1976 fi1rnre  of $3,083 in annual benefits compared to a  national average of $1,380. In the Aid to Fam mes with Dependent Children program, Ha. wail is providing $497 per month for fam111es  of four; at the other end of the spectrum,  Mississippi is providing $60.  Obviously Hawali and Mississippi would be  affected  differently by  a  national welfare  program. Hawaii's representatives  in Con gress must try to protect Hawa.U's interests  when welfare legislation is considered.  It is likely, for example, that Hawa11 would  want to maintain lts high level of benefits by  supplementing  federal benefits, as  it does  now. If so, federal and State benefits should  be meshed in the most efficient way possible.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Another area of concern is work require ments. The State has established stiff work  requirements for  its general assistance pro gram, which  ls entirely State-funded. Lax  requirements  in a  federal program would  represent a step backward.  One of Hawaii's chief concerns is stemming  the  flow of Ma.inland' residents who come  here and try to get on the welfare rolls. Gov.  Ariyoshi has proposed a  residence require ment to cope with this practice, but its con stitutionality ls questionable.  A national welfare system might make a  residence requirement unfeasible, especially  if federal  funding  ls  increased. But a na tional system might relieve immigration pres sure by raising benefits  in states in which  benefits are now low. This might lessen the  attraction of states with higher benefits.  Moreover, a  truly na.tiona.l system would  strengthen the case for the federal govern ment's shouldering the burden of immigrants  on welfare, whether  they be  from  foreign  countries or other states.  The President says he wants to scrap the  present Jumble of welfare programs and re place it with one simple ca.sh payment. He  wants to create Jobs to accommodate welfare  recipients who are able to work and to pro vide financial  incentives to draw recipients  into  Job  training and ultimately employ ment.  These a.re laudable objectives, but the de tails will be all-important, and they a.re not  known as yet. Even after the President's pro posals are completed, it will  take Congress  many months to deal with wel!are reform. At  this point we can only hope that the final  product takes account of the Islands' special  welfare problems.  WHEN BOXING HAD CLASS  HON. J. J. PICKLE  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 13, 1977  ",1977
229,,95,-0.218,834,12,Mr. PICKLE.," Mr. Speaker, there may  much dispute  among observers  about  what caused the decline  in the art of  prizefighting. Some say that professional  boxing was  ruined by overexposure on  television. Others may opine  that the  hoopla  surrounding  the  heavyweight  matches  ruins  the actual event. Pro moters who  arrange  bouts with  one  fighter  taking on  five different oppo nents have certainly added to the circus like atmosphere.  Probably the best entertainment for  fight fans today is in the amateur bouts,  especially the Golden Gloves.  A man who has contributed greatly to  that program over the years is also the  best fighter ever to come out of Austin,  Tex., Tommy Attra.  Tommy is still in excellent shape and  probably as recently as 8 or 10 years ago  could have gone  several  rounds with  many  top-ranked  light-heavies.  I salute Tommy for his work over the  years, and  insert an article  from  the  American-Statesman about his contribu tions to the sport:  [From the Austin  (Tex.) American-States man, Mar. 6, 1977]  AN AUSTIN LANDMARK, AND A GOOD FIGHTER  (By Lou Ma.ysel)  Tom Attra, in addition to almost certainly  being the best fighter Austin has ever pro duced, ls somewhat of a landmark downtown,  May 13, 1977  1942 and  where he operates in a very conspicuous way  as a newspaper street sales manager.  A year or so ago a. visitor stopped hlm and  said, ""I haven't been here in 20 years. You're  the only thing downtown I recognize.""  At 68, Attra is graying, his face shows a few  wrinkles and his legs aren't what they once  were; but other than that he's changed only a  little. He's only nine or 10 pounds over his  best fighting weight of 172 pounds and his  muscles are firm and his stomach so hard he  probably could still shake off a  solid body  punch.  Although he hasn't sparred in more than 10  years, the two-time national Golden Gloves  champion still puts on gloves twice a week for  four 1 ¥2-minute rounds of savage punching  on a heavy bag at a  local athletic club. He  also chins himself 20 to 25 times and does 50  situps, 25 at a  time, during his workout.  It's only designed to keep himself in shape  because Attra., despite his killer ways in the  ring,  claims he  always walks  away  from  trouble. Which is a change from when he first  started sell1ng newspapers 49 yea.rs ago. Then  he used to run from lt.  ""Momma and Daddy wouldn't let me fight  and all  the kids Jumped on me because I  wouldn't fight  back. Some of  them were  smaller than I wa.s. They'd make me cry and  beg them to quit,"" Attra remembered.  Years later when he was doing roadwork  in Guam for a service boxing show, someone  who knew him only by his nickname, ""Banjo""  (which is short for ""Banjo Eyes""), stopped  hlm a.nd asked him what he was doing. When  Attra.  told  him,  the  guy  questioned his  veracity, remembering. ""You were the biggest  sissy in Austin when I left.""  It's hard to believe that anyone with this  sort of reputation would venture  into the  ring  for 188 pro and amateur fights, and  count those national Golden Gloves titles in  '45 as his top achievements.  Back when he was running from trouble,  Attra's idol was Matt Martinez,  the  local  Mexican food restaurateur. ""Matt was sell ing papers, too, and nobody bothered him. He  was a good lightweight and pretty tough,""  Attra recalled.  Attra. got  into boxing via wrestling. He  participated in a wrestling exhibition at a  regional Golden Gloves  tourney and asked  how he could get one of the miniature gold  boxing gloves the winners received.  ""If you want one, why don't you fight for  one?"" he was  told. Though he ""was sea.red  to death,"" Attra decided to enter the next  tournament but lost 8, real slugfest to a good  fighter named Buddy Summers. Attra had a  3-2 edge  in  the knockdowns.  It was  the  only fight he ever lost in Austin.  ""I was going  to quit but a.  sportswriter  here by the name of Wilbur Martin told me  I ought to stay with it. I went back to the  gym eight months ahead of time and started  training,"" he said.  It paid off since Attra went all the way to  the national semlfl.nals at Chicago before los ing  to Joey Ma.xlm,  later the world Ught heavyweight champion. After  that  it was  Just  a matter of  time before he won  a  championship.  The coming of March each year always  makes him a. bit nostalgic because it brings  the state Golden Gloves at Fort Worth where  he had many  fine moments. Although his  Job  is such  that it's hard for him  to get  away, he managed  to go  last year but he  found the competition way off-Just as the  last nationals he saw at Fort Worth in 1973  were disappointing to him.  However, he's stlll remembered by many  oldtime fans up  there and well he should  be. A while back in a. poll to name the top  fighters to appear in the many state tourneys  there, Attra finished second to Port Arthur  lightweight Morris Corona. Port Arthur ban tamweight Dick Menchaca was third and Roy  ",1977

The  staff of  the Senate Governmental Af fairs Committee reported on this subject  in a staff study entitled ""Computer Se curity in Federal Programs."" This docu ment was issued February 2, 1977.  Many of the issues examined in the  staff study are discussed in an article in  the National Observer May 23, 1977, by  August Gribbin. Mr. President,  I  ask  unanimous consent that the National Ob server article be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was ordered to be printed in the Record,  as follows:  [From the National Observer, May 23, 1977)  BEWARE! COMPUTERNIKS AT WORK  As  (By August Gribbin)  It is approaching midnight. In a darkened  office at one of the University of Illinois' com puter centers, four pale, rumpled young men  slt engrossed before consoles llnked to one of  the nation's most advanced computer sys tems. Their fingers flash expertly over  the  terminal keyboards, and the display screens'  illumination glows eerily on their faces.  Most nights they might be working on ar cane, personal computer-programing projects  or playing computer ""games"" until the clean ing crews routs them at 6 p.m. They refer to  themselves as ""computer freaks."" They say  they're ""addicted""  to working with  com puters. And they aren't entirely joking.  Others know  their kind  as  ""computer  butnS,""  ""computerniks,"" ""computer group ies,'' or ""systems hackers"" because  they're  victims o! history's first computer-produced  compulsion. Whether they're basically engi neers, biologists, or philosophers, computer nlks can program computers, and they spend  spectacular amounts o! time doing it.  a  group, computerniks are brilliant,  aloof,  obsessive,  and  almost  always male.  Their compulsive need to display their pro graming virtuosity sometimes leads them to  bend ethical rules. Computer experts and a  recent Senate study contend that such pro grammers are potential pawns o! criminals.  One lawyer specializing in the law of tech nology, August Becqual of Washington, D.C.,  estimates that computer crime now costs the  nation $100 million a year.  Just for the challenge o! it, computerniks  have been known to crack security codes set  up by other programmers to prevent access  to confidential material. Some have gone fur ther, stealing and selling  the information.  In a case now awaiting trial, cr1m1ne.ls al legedly persuaded computer programmers to.  alter Penn Central Railroad  programs  to  divert 200  loaded freight cars to a  remote  siding. Tne crooks allegedly unloaded  the  goods and sold them for about $100 milllon.  Moreover, because computer time itsel! is so  expensive,  computernlks have occasionally  ""stolen"" thousands of dollars worth of it !or  their unauthorized personal projects-such  as handicapped horses.  Prof. Joseph Welzenbaum o! the Massa chusetts Institute of Technology, author of  the recent Computer Power and Human Rea son (W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco;  300 pages; $5.95), says in an interview that  he ls a reformed compulsive programmer. His  book provides somewhat  florid but widely  accepted explanation of the term:  ""Wherever computer centers have become  established ..  bright young men of dishev eled appearance, o!ten with sunken glowing  eyes, can be seen sitting at computer con soles, their arms tensed and waiting to fire  their fingers ... at the buttons and keys on  which their attention seems to be as riveted  as a gamblers' on the rolling dice. When not  so transfixed, they often sit on tables strewn  with computer printouts over which  they  pore like possessed students of a cabalistic  text. They work until they nearly drop, 20,  30 hours at a  time. Their food, 1! they ar range it, is brought to them: coffee, Cokes,  sandwiches. If possible  they sleep on cots  near the computer. But only for a few hours.  ... They are oblivious to their bodies and to  the world in which they move. They exist  at least when so engaged, only through and  for the computers.""  ordinary  programmer might work  marathon stints on occasion and seem in toxicated by the challeages, but he addresses  himsel! to the problem, does lengthy prepar atory pa.per work,  records his proress, and  lets others operate the computer. Compulsive  programmers  rarely allow  that. And  they  seldom keep notes or charts, says Weizen baum.  An  A CONTRAST IN REALITlES  Other programmers explain that comput ernlks excel in the technical aspects of pro graming. They learn each nuance of  their  computer, its peripheral equipment, e.nd its  programs. They work extremely fast-main ly to ""interact"" wlih the machine. It's the  computernik's speed and ingenuity, in fact,  that makes him  invaluable  to  computer center managers.  Generally  the  compulsive  programmer  communicates better With machines  than  with humans, some observers say. Program ing also allows the computernik to create a  ""world"" that he can rule, and he gains a  feeling of ultimate power by doing so, ac cording to Weizenbaum.  The !our youths at the University o! Illi nois agree. They speak rapidly, constantly  :fingering the terminal keyboards and invent ing excuses to call up information that :flash es obediently onto  the screens.  ""Working  with these things isn't a compulsion; we just  have to do lt, one quips .. Another explains:  ""In the computer world I have control;  in  the real world  I don't. It's a  contrast  in  realities. I sometimes think it's like I try to  live inside the computer.""  The four youths say the computer gives  them a sense o! power and prestige, and they  concede that the delusion might be danger ous. One confesses  that he has created a  program to stop computer operations at the  campus and has used it twice, once !or fun  and. again after a  faculty member angered  him.  (PLATO, the huge, innovative time-shar ing computer system at Illinois, primarily 1s  a  ""robot""  teacher serving certain colleges,  high schools, and elementary schools in 23  states. It also performs crucial operations for  a local blood bank and at least one military  installation.)

A student in a high school about  90 miles away did it once, and a youth work ing  in  a  Junior-college  computer  center  tapped a phone line, recorded the computer  signals transmitted on it, and thus obtained  access code  that let him obtain relatively  sensitive data from the computer. ""Like all  computerniks, he just had to demonstrate  that he could do anything with the system,""  comments Paul Tenczar, head of PLATO's  programing statr.  Compternlks' compulsion to show off wor ries  computer-security experts. They con tend that computernlks, believing that feats  of virtuosity will gain them recocnition in  their low-key, esoteric domain, can't refuse  challenges. This can make them easy marks  !or persuasive white-collar thieves, extortion ists, and other crooks.  ESSENTIAL TO THE GOVERNMENT  an Encyclopaedia Britannica mailing  The magnitude o! the crimes a computer nik can commit is astounding. In one exam ple, a programmer gained unauthorized ac cess to a computer's data bank and extracted  list,  Sale of the list netted the thieves $3 million.  And  the  legendary Equity Funding Corp.  scandal couldn't have occurred without the  computer programmers who  set up  some  60,000 bogus insurance pollcies and subjected  them to :fictitious claims. The money from  the claims went to the thieves, who Inilked  Equity of $300 million.  The Government utilizes about 10,000 com puters. And the Government Accounting Of fice says automated, ""decision making"" com puters annually issue at lea.st $26 billion in  checks, not counting pay checks. These com puters send out bills totaling $10 billion and  requisitions tor goods costing more than $8  billion. The bills, checks, and orders are is sued, signed, and mailed by computer; no  human  examines  them  to  see  they're  correct.  One study states flatly  that the Federal  Government  could  not  function without  computers. It's significant,  then, that in a  recent study  titled Computer Security  Federal Programs (Government Printing Of fice, Washington, D.C.  20402;  298  pages;  $2 .80) , the Senate's Government Operations  Committee staff reports that only the com puters of the FBI and CIA ce.n be considered  ""secure."" The report adds: ""Some Govern ment personnel, particularly in the area of  national defense, are troubled by the possi b111 ty that 'systems hackers  and 'compulsive  programmers'  could  cause  problems .    Whether through the desire to make mischief  or to create genuine damage, such persons,  working in an academic environment where  Federal contracts are also being executed,  could, it 1s feared, compromise, gain unau thorized access  to, surreptitiously alter, or  otherwise  render  ineffective computer sys tems supporting Gov ?rnment programs.""  1!  in  VULNERABLE TO TINKERING  Roughly 60 per cent of America's banks  could not !unction tomorrow 1! their com puters or programs were seriously damaged  tonight, the report states.

Computerniks are especially error-prone  at times, Parker adds. Professor Weisenbaum,  concurring, describes such an occasion: ""The  compulsive programmer's excitement rises to  its most feverish pitch when ... everything  ought to work but the computer neverthelesc  reproaches him by misbehaving in a number  of mysterious,  apparently unrelated ways.  .  .  .

233,,95,-0.388,990,12,Mr. SISK.," Mr. Sneaker, after years of  neglect by the national media, public of ficials, and the general public, some atEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  tention  is :finally being given to illegal  immigration, the source of almost half of  our population growth. Although  this  body has twice passed legislation to deal  with the problem, neither the Senate nor  the White House have shown much in terest. I am pleased, the ref ore, that our  new President has vowed to do something  about the estimated 1 million aliens who  enter surreptitiously or overstay as visi tors or students each year. However, an  important element of his plan, which ad ministration sources say will be presented  to the Congress shortly, will be to grant  amnesty to a vast portion of  the esti mated 6  to 8 million  illegal aliens al ready here. These newly legalized aliens  would be free to bring their immediate  families and dependents  to  the United  States. Perhaps some form of amnesty is  essential for the acceptance of any effec tive program to stem the illegal alien tide,  but as noted by New York Times colum nist James Reston, who has written quite  extensively on this issue of late:  The chances are that this problem will in crease unless  the administration and  the  Congress look at ... Cabinet recommenda tions with the utmost care.  I highly recommended two recent col umns by Mr. Reston to my colleagues:  Is ANYBODY LISTENING?  (By James Reston)  WASHINGTON, May 7.-0ne of  the  odd  things about life in America these days, as  Eric Hoffer and many others keep pointing  out, is that we don't know what ls happen ing to us. We have the most advanced and  sophisticated communications systems  the  world has even known, but somehow-de spitd our computers, pollsters and informa tion  satellites-the  elemental  facts  don't  seem to penetrate the American mind.  It is not that the facts are not available.  This citv is drowning in statistics. But here  1s Joe Califano, the new Secretary of Health,  Educatlon  and Welfare,  complaining  that  popular myths about  the poor overwhelm  the facts and that ""the real welfare problem  may well be the widespread lack of public  understanding of what the welfare picture  really is ... ""  Here also is the retiring commissioner of  the United States Immigration and Naturali zation Service, Leonard F. Chapman Jr., com plaining on his way out that illegal immigra tion into the United States ""is hopelessly out  of control ... but we as a nation are re fusing to acknowledge it and w~ are taking  few,  if any, steps to cope with it.""  In an interview with this reporter before  he left, General Chapman made the following  points:  The United States still has the most gen erous immigration policy in the world. Every  year w~  accept 400,000  legal  immigrants,  ""more than the total number of immigrants  accepted by all the rest of the nations on  earth."" But the lllegal immigrants far out number the legals every year.  ""There are  the United States  today,""  General Chapman said ""six to eight million  lllegal aliens and  that number  is  increas ing by half a million a year. The Immigration  Service arrested 900,000 of them last year,  and we are only skimming the surface.""  This  is not merely a Mexican problem though Mexico is the source of about three  quarters of the illegals. Every year about 6  million aliens enter  the United States on  visitors' or student :visas ""and about 10 per cent of them remain lllegally and take jobs  whenever they can.""  Smuggling illegals into the country, even  arranging bogus marriages to keep them here,  has become big business. ""We apprehended  over 82,000 illegal a.Hens who had been aided  in  May 16, 1977  last year by smugglers,"" General Chapman  said, ""and we caught 9,600 smugglers.""  Up to half a million aliens enter the United  States every year with counterfeit, altered or  borrowed documents, but_ patrolling 6,000  miles of land borders and searching out il legals  in a U.S. population of 210 million  with 2,900 enforcement officers is clearly in adequate. Last year  the Immigration Serv1ce had exactly one helicopter to patrol the  2,000-mile Mexican border. Now it has two.  Like Mr. Califano, General Chapman com plains about the popular myths that have  impeded reform of the immigration policy.  One of these is that the jobs illegals take a.re  the underpaid dog-work U.S. citizens reject.  ""This is only partly true,"" he says. ""About  two-thirds of the illegal aliens we apprehend  are working in industry, service and construc tion jobs that pay good salaries-jobs that  might be filled by the 20 percent of jobless  American teen-agers or by the 40 percent of  black American youths who are out of work.""  Mr. Califano  is clearly  impressed by  the  difference between popular myths and facts.  ""The most pernicious and widespread myth,""  he says, ""is that people are poor because they  don't work and don't want to work and that  the welfare rolls are replete with loafers.  ""The facts,"" Mr. Califano insists, ""are quite  different. Nearly 71 percent of the 26 million  poor individhals in the nation represent peo ple that we do not normally ask to work:  children and young people under 16;  the  aged;  the  severely  disabled;  students  or  mothers with children under 16 .. .. Thus 90  percent of poor Americans either work full or  part-time, or are people no civilized society  would force to work.""  Mr. Califano is not defending the present  system. He is staggered by the magnitude a.nd  complexity of the welfare problem. But in the  end, like General Chapman, he is even more  baffled a.bout how to get the facts across to  the people and their representatives in the  Congress.  Even the new President and the new Vice  President, who  concentrated  during  the  campaign on  the  internal problems of the  nation, are now off again this month in Lon don and elsewhere in Europe concentrating  in foreign problems. though the major threat  to the free nations of the world  is not the  traditional threat of war but the unfamiliar  threat of disunity and disruption within  their own societies.  ""We are a different people living in a differ ent country,"" Eric Hoffer has observed, but  he doesn't tell us how different.  We are vaguely a.ware  that something is  happening to the American family and to the  coherence of our society, that almost half the  human race is under 25, most of them living  in misery and more and more of them gaining  lllegal refuge in the United States before we  have even been able to take care of our own  poor. But as Messrs. Chapman and Callfano  testified, nobody seems to be listening.  in  PUBLIC PoLICY ON  ILLEGAL ALIENS  (By James Reston)  WAsHINGTON.-President Carter's Cabinet  committee on what to do about the six mil lion  to eight million  lllegal aliens  the  United States has now sent its recommenda tions to the White House, and these recom mendations  raise some  fundamental ques tions of public policy.  For example. it 1""1 understood that Secre tary of Labor Marshall and Attv. Gen. Bell  have proposed  that  there should be some  kind of limited amnesty !or aliens-primar ily Mexicans-who have entered the United  States lllegally.

The Friends Committee on  National Legislation has prepared an  excellent question and answer fact.sheet  on  the Hatfleld-Abourezk amendment  which  is valuable  in explaining  the  amendment itself and in clart!ytng what  it would do. I  therefore ask unanimous  consent that it be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the factsheet  was ordered to be printed in the REcoRD,  as follows:  FACTSHEET  1. The bill reported by the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee already contal _s hu man rights language. What is the dlf[erence  between it and the Abourezk-Hatfleld pro po.sal?

It suggests human rights pollcy guidelines  when U.S.  representatives vote  in  interna tional  financial  institutions  tor  loans. -But  the President  is given complete discretion  as to whether he shall follow them. In addi tion, the Committee's bill, Sec. 702, repeals  stronger human  rights  language approved  by Congress in 1976 for the Inter-American  Development Ban.It and African Development  Fund.  The Abourezk-Hatfield amendment, on the  other hand, sets a. mandatory standard: The  U.S. representative must vote a.ga~t a. loan  to  a  government which  consistently  and  grossly violates human right""unless such  assistance is directed specifically to programs  which serve the basic human need of citi zens o! such country.""  2.

Similar  language,  the  s.mend ment,"" was adopted by Congress in 1975 to  apply to the U.S. bilateral aid program (P.L.  94-161) and in 1976 to apply to the Inter American Development Bank and the Afri can Development Fund  (P.L. 94-302}.

245,House,95,0.014,1211,12,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. Speaker, today I  am again reintroducing legislation deal ing with a problem vital to our national  long-range food producing capability. We  cannot continue to lose more than 1 mil lion  acres of prime agricultural  land  yearly without it having a serious impact  on our total food and fiber production.  The scope of this problem goes well be yond the issue of diminishing farmland  acreage. It has a direct relationship to  the ability of our family farmers to own  and operate farmland on which the price  is constantly being bid higher and higher  in value. It is quite conceivable that if  this trend continues, much of our farm land could be owned by interests outside  the agricultural sector.  Factors such as energy usage, availa bility of water, and the future cost of  food  to consumers all need  to be ex amined closely since they all will be di rectly affected by the amount of available  farmland.  few weeks ago,  the Boston Globe  A  published an article dealing specifically  with this issue and the impact it has had  in New England. I would like to insert  this article in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  as part of my remarks  today. It sum marizes this problem very well:  OUR VANISHING FARMLAND  (By Charles Bonenti)  New England's  farmland  has  been  dis appeartng, and with it has gone the region's  ability  to  feed  itself. In the past 25 years  we've lost almost 80 percent of our farms to  taxes, development, and competition  from  growers  elsewhere. weve become.  as  one  Connecticut official put it, ""the Bangladesh  of America,"" dependent on other parts of the  country for r.early 85 percent of what we eat.  It means we not only pay 6 percent more  than the national average for food, but ha\""e  little if any cushion against shortages.  We produce most of our own dairy prod ucts and contribute  a  hefty share of  the  nation s potatoe~.  cranberries.  and maple  syrup, but for  red meat, grain, most veg etables, and other diet staples we  rely on  s:>urces hundreds  and  eyen  thousands of  miles away.  If you  live  in Boston,  for  example, you  probably  drank Florida  orange  juice  for  breakfast this morning, had Iowa bacon with  your eggs from Maine, poured milk from a  local dairy  into your Brazili:3.n  coffee, and  munched a  slice of toast made  from Mid west grain.  If you had soup for lunch, the vegetables  in lt were probably grown in California, and  if you're having steak tonight, you can bet  it's from Nebraska.  If a major strike or natural disaster should  halt  the  flow of  these products  into New  England, even  for  a  period of  -.veeks, we  would face a regional food shortage cf monu men t.11 proportior.s.  We've already had a  taste of s:10rtages in  re::ent years. The 1973  truckers' strike, for  example. drained supermarl{Ct meat counters  of beef. lamb, and p::.rk.  leaving many of us  toe-at chicken, fish, and other meatless meals  for weeks.  In 1973, a  se.-ere Christmas  ice  storm crippled food deliveries to major cities  in Connecticut.  for::ing  families  there  to  stretch household stocks as best they could.  The  loss of 50 percent of Florida's citrus  crop this winter, one of the coldest winters  on  record,  the California drought, and  the  natural gas shortage are already being felt  in higher prices and shortages in the North.  Incidents like these, coupled with a grow ing public concern over  rising energy and  food price.;;, are forcing government officials  to take a hard look at longstanding land-use  practices that have allowed farms to be gob bled up for housing, highways, and super markets. Insurance against future shortages  would be to preserve whatever farmland re mains in New England.  By any estimate,  the  loss of agricultural  land  in  the  region over  the past 25 years  has been alarming.  In 1950, according to the US Department  of Agriculture, New England had  a  total  of 126,000 farms. Today there are only 27,280. There were 13.8 million acres  in agri culture  then. There are  5.4 million  acres  today. Over the same period, our population  increased about one-third, from 9.4 million  to more than 12 million.  The farms we have left tend to be bigger an average of 198 acres compared to 109 in  1950-more productive and more specialized  than those 25 years ago. Dairy, broiler, and  cranberry production are actually up, while  beef, potatoes and maple  syrup have de clined.  The productivity we have achieved, how ever. depends on modern farming methods  that consume enormous amounts of  fossil  fuel energy. And as fewer farmers are called  upon to feed more people on less land, that  dependence on dwindling and costly  fossil  fuels puts us in a precarious balance.  What economists and agriculture experts  are asking is how much longer we can main tain that balance, not just in New England,  but nationwide. It would take 10 times the  energy reserves we have now to double the  yield of our farms. The alternative to energy intensive farming  is  to bring more arable  land  into production and  to rely more on  manpower  than on machinery. Given  the  land and energy squeeze we're already facing  in New England, either choice would demand  tremendous public sacrifice. Our best hope,  many experts feel, lies in finding alternatives  to wasteful land-use practices that have al lowed good farmland to be paved with black top, wasteful  technology  that has driven  up farm costs and drained energy reserves,  and food-pricing policies  that farmers say  arc putting them out of business.  Agriculture already accounts for 3.5 per cent of US energy consumption. As an  in dustry, it ranks third in demand for fossil  fuels behind steelmaking and petroleum re fining. Fossil fuels go into all sorts of agri cultural activities from the 12.8 million tons  of fertilizer spread annually over 337 mil lion acres of US farmland to the 6 million  tractors farmers use  to till the soil, spread  that fertilizer, plant their crops, and harvest  them. Fossil  fuels go  In to  the making of  pesticides and herbicides and into the planes  and equipment that spray pest and weed killers over the fields. Farmers rely on elec tricity to pump water for  livestock and ir rigation,  to run milking machines, and  to  control  the  temperatures  in poultry sheds  and incubators.  And we  consumers depend on  oil  and  electricity for the processing, packaging, and  shipment of food to our local supermarkets.  Agriculture  in  the United States bas be come so dependent on abundant fossil fuel  energy  that it petroleum and gas supplies  should be severely cut short, modern farming  as we know it would collapse.  A  report prepared by  the Stanford Re search  Institute  for  the Federal Office o!  Civil Defense predicts that without the heavy  applications of  fert111zers now being used,  the annual US wheat and corn harvest could  drop about 45 percent in one year, leading  to widespread slaughter of livestock depend ent on  these feed grains. And without pe troleum,  the  report goes on, none of our  ma ior food er feed crops, which are all me chanically planted and cultivated, could be  harvested under present methods.  The report was compiled in 1969 to show  the potential effect of a nuclear attack on  agricultural  production, but  its  statistics  give a chilling picture, nonetheless, of how  far removed farming is today from the n!l.tu ral cycles of ecology.  It got that way because modern farming  is caught in a double squeeze; a squeeze to  get more productivity out of a fixed amount  of land and a. squeeze to cut costs because  farmers cannot set the price o! food  they  sell.  Farming is not like clothing or automobile  manufacturing.  People can be persuaded to buy two cars,  three  television  sets,  and closets  full  of  clothes, even if they don't really need them  to survive. But the demand for food is con stant. It doesn't rise or fall with the supply.  People need food to stay alive and they will  do almost anything to get it when it is scarce.  In times like that, prices rise. When !ood ls  abundant on the other hand, people won't  buv more than they can eat, so prices fall.  The rise and fall in prices during periods  of scarcity and abundance has historically  created ""boom and bust"" cycles !or the farm er-years of profit followed by years of loss.  To protect the farmer from these disrup tive ups and downs and at the same time  keep  food prices relatively stable for con sumers,  the Federal government has  long  pursued a policy of agricultural price sup ports, paying farmers not to produce, gu-ar",1977

248,,95,-0.509,1237,12,Mr. BINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker,  I  am  proud,  indeed,  that  the Bronx High  School of Science, one of the outstand ing schools in the country, is in my con gressional district.  Following is an article on this school  which appeared  in today's Wall Street  Journal:  ELITE  HIGH-BRONX  SCHOOL  OFFERS  BRIGHT CITY  KIDS  EDUCATION  OF  SCIENCE  TOP-NOTCH  ( By Roger Ricklefs)  NEW YoRK.-Most high schools would be  delighted to have even one student like Vic tor Menon.  At age 16, the slender Bronx High School  of Science senior already corresponds with  Harvard Medical School  professors on  re search  techniques.  He  spends  Saturday  mornings taking an electronics course at CoSTRONG  IN HUMANITIES  But the school is strong in the humanities  a,; well as science.  ( Only 60', of the gradu ates enter science-related careers. l Students  must  take four years each of English, social  studies and science and three years each of  foreign  language and mathematics. English  classes  require  papers  on  subjects  like  .. Free Will vs. Determination  in Macbeth.""  Also, seniors must 1naster an English vocab ularly list consisting of words such as 'de suetide""  1 meaning  disuse),  ""obloquy   ( verbal abuse), ""rodomontade""  ( arrogantly  boastful talk) and ""teleogy""  c the study of  final causes) .  For the opportunity to work so hard, stu dents gladly suffer long commutes. Andrew  Lo says he rises each day at 5: 30 a..m. and  rides  a  bu.s  and  three  subways  to  reach  Bronx Science. Though  the  trip  takes 2*  hours each way, he says: ""I think it's well  worth  it. This school  is almost like a  col lege.""  While  teachers  say  student motivation  accounts for much of the school's success,  the curriculum itself ls unusual. The biology  department offers a  four-year sequence of  to make students  courses partly designed  think like scientists. To an uncommon ex tent, even sophomores are required to de15167  vise their own valid, controlled experiments  to test hypotheses. ""The 10th grade lab does  experiments that practically every other bi ology program in the world does as  teacher  demonstrations,"" says Milton Kopelman, de partment chairman.  COLLEGE-LEVEL COURSE  In  the senior year.  165 students  take a  college-level biology course that constitutes  the largest advanced placement biology pro gram in the nation. One senior. Daniel Pe trylak, will have a  research paper read  to  the International Congress of Protozoology  in New York in June. Another senior had a  paper published in the Journal of Ophthal mology. The department  receives a  steady  stream of foreign and American educators  wanting  to observe  its famous program. It  has recently received a federal grant to pre pare materials and disseminate the program  to other schools.  In the mathematics department. students  start working with computers as early  as  the 10th grade. One youngster, Jacob Gold field, became so entranced with  them  that  he volunteered  to work  for nothing at a  nearby hospital's computer center. Eighteen  months later, the precocious student is now  a  paid computer consultant there.  Indeed,  he has made so many changes in the hospi tal's computer  operations  that while  at  school he wears a hospital beeper on his belt  to enable the hospital to contact him in case  of  questions.  'Besides,""  he  says,  .. my  mother likes to be able to get in touch with  me:  With students like this. the atmosphere at  Bronx Sclen~e differs greatly from  that in  the usual urban high school. The students about 55', male-mostly dress in neat, clean  blue  jeans  and  sneakers.  Teachers  say  classroom  disciplinary  problems  scarcely  exist.  The school  itself is incongruously located  a  few  blocks  from  a  subway  car  yard.  Though surrounded by uninspired apartment  houses in a quiet Bronx neighborhood. the  four-story building overlooks a grassy play ing field and has the atmosphere of a subur ban high school. A huge mosaic portraying  history's famous scientists  in action domi nates the entrance. The loboy  is also filled  with  glass  cabinets  stuffed with  trophies  won  in science. mathematics and debating.  Classrooms are clean and graffiti are rare.  Of course. the school has some problems.  New  York  City's  financial  squeeze  has  trimmed the faculty and added three or four  students  to many classes  in  the pa-st  two  years. Classes of 35 or 36 students aren't un usual today. Though  the school has its own  small  planetarium with  a  silver-colored  dome protruding from the roof, it goes un used for lack of repair money.  Moreo,er.  even  teachers  concede  the  physics and chemistry department is heavy  with deadwood waiting for retirement. While  same English teachers write detailed, pains taking corrections on student essavs others  skimp. Foreign-language teachers oft~n con centrate on grammar and syntax and give  students little conversational practice.  Yet students praise much of the faculty  effusively. Teachers  are  eager  to work at  Bronx Science,  especially  in  view  of  the  problems elsewhere. ""I came here because  my brain was turning to cheese,"" says Mark  Rifkin, widely praised chairman of the Eng lish department, who previously taught in a  vocational high school.  SUPERIOR FACULTY  Because of its fine reputation, the school  can choose its teaching staff from the cream  of the crop. It can offer jobs to anybody eli gible for appointment on the basis of civU service  test  scores  and  similar  criteria.  Teachers appointed through transfer within  the city school system are selected on the  basis of seniority, but  transfers never ac",1977
249,,95,-0.457,1250,12,Mr. RONCALIO.," Mr. Speaker, Gillette,  Wyo.,  is one of the best known boom towns. Extensive studies have been con ducted about this community sitting on  the world's largest coal deposit. Without  any help from the Federal Government,  the city and State of Wyoming have co operated in their struggle to cope with  the many problems associated with rapid,  unplanned growth. There is still a water  shortage, housing shortage,  inadequate  sewage treatment, and lack of recrea tional facilities.  Although r.eaping many benefits from  this area, the Federal Government has  virtually disregarded the problems with  the exception of studying them. The re sources will continue  to grow  in  im portance to the Nation. I would hope a  knowledge of  these unwanted side ef fects of energy development would re sult  in meaningful Federal assistance.  The following article by the mayor of  Gillette, Michael Enzi, is a sad commen tary on  the bumbling of  the Federal  Government on impacted communities.  I commend him for being a lucid writer  as well as a great mayor.  The article follows:  rFrom the Los Angeles Times, May 15, 1977]  WYOMING'S COAL VEINS JUST BRING  TROUBLES  (By Michael B. Enz!)  We've known for years that Gillette was  sitting on top of the single largest coal de posit in the world-a strip of coal 150 feet  deep at some points, 80 miles long and from  20 to 30 miles wide.  If the United States had no coal except  the coal in Campbell County, Wyo.-where  Gillette  is  the only  incorporated town-it  would still be the fourth-largest coal-pro ducing country (instead of the first). Only  Russia, China and West Germany have larger  coal deposits than Campbell County. To put  it another way, the Bureau of Land Manage ment says that the county has 12 % of the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  known coal reserves in the world. And some  of it ls so close to the surface that we have  trouble digging sanitary landfills in G1llette  to bury our garbage-we keep striking coal.  Despite  the  impressive statistics, nobody  got very excited about our coal until  the  energy crisis. There was  far more  interest  when oil was discovered near Glllette in 1967;  for a time the town became the center of one  of the top oil-producing areas in the country.  Although new wells are still being discovered,  oil production has leveled off since 1971 and  ls resoonslble for only a  small  increase in  the population-and troubles-of Glllette.  Yes, we have troubles. The energy crisis  made it obvious that the United States would  be  forced  to  return  to coal as a primary  source of  fuel  as petroleum  supplies  ran  out. It was also apparent that the easiest  and least expensive way to increase coal pro duction was to turn west, where vast supplies  Ile close  to  the surface and can be strlp mlned.  It means  the  creation of  instant  boom towns.  Less than a decade ago, at the time of the  first big oil strike. Gillette was a  ranching  community of 3,500 people who exchanged  tough winters  for glorious  summers  in  a  corner of northeastern Wyoming so remote  that they had to drive 135 miles to Casper  for any excitement.  Today we have a. population of 10,000 which  is expected to double in the next three years,  with a projection for 35,000 by 1985. And we  have excitement at last,  if you count coal  trains rumbling through the town day and  night, cutting it in two; a water shortage,  a. housing shortage, a race with time to secure  adequate  sewage-treatment  fac111ties,  a  severe shortage of recreation  fa.c111tles  a.nd  even a. shortage of accurate information on  which to base future planning.  Oh, and we have a money shortage, too.  The City Council bas set some priorities  a.nd  ls trying to handle one ma ior problem  each year while beating out brushfires which  come up in other areas. This is the year to  concentrate on water, and in recent months  we have dug new wells and  increased our  water supply by 45 % . Last August we  let  bids  to  triple our water-storage  capacity.  We're  looking  for  other  additional water  supplies to take care of the continually in creasing population. rt's ~olng to cost some where between $17 and $30 m11lion. and we've  b~n forced  to raise  the water  investment  fee, which  is  like a member""'hip for water  users,  from $250  to $950 plus costs. That  means a water connection for a new house or  business costs almost $1,000.  Housing bas us almost in despair: Jn the  pa.,1t 13 years, 300 houses have been built in  Gillette. A  recent  economic  base  study  showed  that we should be building 1,500  houses a year-in other words, one out of  every  thousand new houses  in  the United  States  should  be built  in G1llette, Wyo.  Housing  developers haven't been  flocking  here, however, because they weren't sure the  coal boom was real. As a. consequence, the  housing market is very tight. Many of the  new workers-who have caused the average  age in town to drop to 25-are just getting  started in their first jobs and can only afford  mobile homes, for which easy financing  is  available.  We don't have any fac111ties for large num bers of mobile homes, so quite an encamp ment has grown up at our local fishing lake  and playground. It has only two restrooms no showers, water supplies or laundry fac111ties-and therefore we a..sked the Department  of Housing and Urban Development for a  grant to build a mobile-home vlllage. I don't  think  they read our application, however,  because when they turned us down they said  G1llette didn't need another playground.  It has been equally frustrating trying to  get federal help to expand our sewage-treat ment fac111t1es, which are at capacity. The  Environmental Protection Agency rejected a  May 17, 1977  request for help, saying that Glllette already  had a treatment plant and must wait until  27 other towns 1n Wyoming got their first  ones.  The Economic Development Agency turned  us down because expanded fac111ties would  encourage growth and therefore create ad verse conditions. Encourage growth? We've  already got growth and adverse conditions!  If the federal government has been stingy  with its money, it has been generous about  sending experts here to G11lette to study us.  City employes and officials  spend  endless  hours being interviewed by researchers, who  arrive in teams and listen carefully as we  explain our problems. A few months or even  a  few years later we receive copies of their  reports, which say just what we told them.  But this process doesn't give us any new in formation or help, nor are we ever asked to  help design studies which would help.  When the federal government reqUires en vironmental impact statements, why doesn't  it find out bow municipalities a.re affected by  such developments as the coal boom? It is  hard to get G1llette people worried a.bout the  life span of the antelope when they are on  water rationing.  Many times I've asked the researchers from  Washington to get us some help in the form  of grants, but they come back saying, ""You  know, you're right, you're not eligible  for  anything."" It's because we're in an economic  situation which ls out of step with the rest of  the nation. The government is set tip to stop  deterioration with urban renewal programs,  for example, not to cope with growth.  If we can't count on the federal govern ment for much help, where can we turn? We  haven't been sitting around  just wringing  our hands. For one thing, the city of Glllette  and Campbell County probably have the best  city-county cooperation  in  the state. The  city's property tax is at the maximum rate  allow~d by law, and raises about $100,000 a  year. Most of the companies moving to the  area. are outside the city limits, so the county  gets  their  tax revenue. The county builds  and maintains the roads going to all the new  mines, a.nd so forth, but it also operates the  recreation center, library and hospital, all of  which a.re  in Gillette. The county gave us  the land for a new water-storage facility and  the site for a. new well.  A $9 million county bond issue to build a  new hospital was passed recently. We're work ing now to transfer the airport to county  jurisdiction-major carriers probably will be  flying in here by 1980 and airport lmorove ment is expected to cost about $6 mlllion.  We're hoping the railroad will do some thln~ about the tracks which cut G11lette tn  half. There's constant traffic now with coal,  and emergency vehicles have no way to get  through when a  train  ts passing. We need  to divert the traffic or at least to build an  overpass. Railroads are becoming quite an  issue in Wyoming. For the first  time since  World War II new tracks are being built.  Despite all the problems, I'm optimistic.  The newcomers have a good spirit and the  old-timers accept  the fact  that growth  is  inevitable. In a town like Gilette It's easy to  see what needs to be done and relatively easy  to get it done.  TOM HULETT AND CONCERT'S  WEST  HON. JOHN J.

A close friend of mine, and  of everyone  in Washington County 1s  about to close a long and distinguished  career.  Richard Doub  is  retiring  after  46  years of teaching and coaching in Wil liamsport schools. A  lifelong  resident  of the-county, Mr. Doub leaves behind  him an outstanding legacy. To his stu dents of mathematics and history, he  offered knowledge and inspiration: As a  coach, his record may never be equaled;  his  teams have won more  than 500  games in three sports.  Richard Doub,  in his 68 years, has  been a major force and friend  to his  town and his county.  I  join with all  Washington Countians  in  saying  to  Richard, congratulations and thanks for  a  job well done. To share more of the  qualities of this man with my colleagues  in the U.S. House of Representatives, I  off er this article by Barb Blass as it ap peared  in  the Morning Herald news paper in Hagerstown:  RICHARD DOUB-END OF AN ""ERA""  (By Barb Blass)  ""I've done what I  really wanted to do.

253,Senate,95,0.196,84,18,Mr. DANFORTH.," Mr.  President,  I  want to present my views on the Middle  East today, not in an attempt to con tribute to any partisan diatribe on the  administration's proPosals, but in an ef fort to contribute to the recent dialogue  on this crucial issue, which has been sig nificantly advanced by Senator JAVITs'  comments last Monday.  I have serious reservations about the  policy being espoused by the Carter ad ministration and about the tactics cur rently being employed.  These reservations were increased by  this week's State Department news re lease. To say as it did, that the United  States considers Israeli withdrawal from  all three fronts-sinai, Golan Heights,  and Gaza--to be necessary to a success ful solution of the conflict and then to  follow that statement with the assertion  that the negotiations ""must start with out any preconditions for either side"" is  the height of obfuscation and contradiction.    The signals which are transmitted to  the Arab nations by the administration's  assertion of the need for withdrawal to  ""approximately""  the pre-1967 borders  are bound to raise expectations on one  side and prejudice  the course of  the  negotiations.  The reservations which I have about  the style of diplomacy, however,  run  deeper than the apparent contradiction  described above. The specificity of the ad ministration's proposals, even if neutral,  which I do not believe these have been,  could have  the effect of  forcing  the  parties  involved  to  take firm positions  prematurely, which would be difficult to  rescind during the actual negotiations.  I  believe  that  the  administration's  plan puts a perspective on the conflict  which is wholly American and far too  academic. It is easy for us, here in this  air-conditioned  forum  surrounded by  District policemen,  to assert  that  the  Israelis should allow Palestinians on theii  borders. It is another thing altogether  for  the citizens of Maalot and Kiryat  Shimona to accept such a ""solution.""  My  reservations do not merely con cern the administration's style, however.  The major problem which I see in the  Carter peace proposals is the imbalance  of demands on Israel as compared  to  those on the Arabs.  Although the implementation of both  Israel's territorial concessions and  the  Arabs' political concessions would be on  a phased-in basis,  the nature of these  concessions would be inherently unequal.  Political concessions, whether they in volve recognition and diplomatic contact  or even trade and open borders, are easily  reversible. No written agreement would  prevent the Arabs from reneging on the  Political terms of any agreement, if they  consider it necessary to do so.  The concessions being demanded of  Tsrael, however, since they involve the  transfer of large tracts of land, are, for  all practical purposes,  irreversible.  Is rael's lightening success during the Six  Day War is unlikely to be repeatable as  the Power of the Arab nations continues  to grow.  I am not declaring that the exchange  of ""territory for peace"" policy is doomed  to f allure. I am clearly stating my posi tion that for the United States to give  the  impression of pushing Israel  into  such an agreement constitutes a great  disservice to a faithful and valuable ally.  I believe that the bottom line of any  American Policv in the Middle East must  be an unswerving support for the con tinued existence and prosperity of the  State of Israel. All peace proposals must  be judged in that light and esPoused with  that goal in mind.  WORLD FOOD AND NUTRITION  STUDY  ",1977
254,,95,0.241,149,18,Mr. ABDNOR.," Mr. Speaker, in keeping  with  the spirit of  a  national energy  policy I am introducing H.B. 8122, a bill  designed to expand the use of noncon ventional energy sources. The vitality of  the United States depends on the avail ability of economic fuels. As fossil fuel  resources are depleted, their cost esca lates. Ultimately, their scarcity will jeop ardize our  transportation unless proc esses are developed for obtaining fuels  from  renewable.  resources--biomass.  Fuels from biomass can provide clean,  convenient  energy  resources  for  our  Nation.  My bill provides for research contracts  to develop processes for converting bio mass to fuels; specifically, to research the  various uses of grain or grain products  and wood and other forest products in  the development of fuels.  Methanol-wood alcohol-and etha nol-grain alcohol-have both been con sidered additives for gasoline. Techni cally, their use as an automotive fuel is  completely feasible. The only restrictions  on their use are those of economics and  supply.  Methanol  is a widely used chemical  with an annual U.S. production of ap proximately 1 billion gallons per year.  Test data of studies performed at MIT  indicate that a blend of 10 to 15 percent  methanol with gasoline provides for the  optimum efficiency level, resulting in in creased power over ordinary gasoline  and  reduction  in automobile pollution  levels while requiring no engine modi fication. Estimates  conclude  that  less  than 1 percent of the total national for est acreage is required to produce a 1year supply of this gasolme.

255,,95,0.34,149,18,Mr. TREEN.," Mr. Speaker, the time for  deregulation of the price of new gas is  now. Are memories so short that we do  not remember the gas shortages of last  winter? Has everyone seen  the predic tions that the gas shortage this winter  will equal or excetd the shortage of last  winter?  While deregulating the price of natural  gas will not immediately solve a problem  caused by years of Government control,  it is the long-range solution.  The artificially  low price of natural  gas has discouraged production. I think  you will find interesting a letter written  by Ken G. Martin, president of Martin  Exploration Co.,  to  the Louisiana De partment  of Conservation  requesting  cancellation of 11 drilling permits  is sued by the State, and announcing that  he was canceling plans for an additional  23 wells. All were potential gas wells. To  my knowledge, this is a totally unprece dented action.  Martin's cancellation of 34 wells rep resented over $31 million worth of gas  exploration, and the equivalent of drill ing over 75 miles of hole. Martin's reason  for canceling the proposed wells is very  clear:  In Martin's case, every single well  it ls  cancell1ng was planned and  the  leases ac quired on  the presumption that President  Carter's free market promise for undedicated  gas would be kept and we could expect a  price equal to at least the risk discounted  replacement cost  (approximately $2.25/MCF  with  15%/year  escalation)  for  such  gas.  President Carter's proposal  rolls back our  anticipated price  to $1.42/MCli'  (which  is  itself subject to a  further rollback to $.52/  MCF) !or wells drllled either within 2Y2 miles  of or less than 1000 feet deeper than another  producing well. Not only do all of Martin's  22101  wells fall into this category, but so do more  than 95 % of all wells drllled in the onshore  and State owned offshore  areas of south  Louisiana, our country's most prolific gas  producing area. The Carter policy  thereby  writes this area off completely, and in effect  withholds from the consumer major gas re serves needed now.  The Energy and Power Subcommittee  recently voted to deregulate new natural  gas. The issue is now before the full In terstate and Foreign Commerce Com mittee and hopefully will soon be before  the House. I urge all of my colleagues  to  read Mr. Martin's letter  reprinted  below and bear it in mind when it comes  time to vote on natural gas deregulation:  METAIRIE, LA.,  May 13, 1977.  Hon. R. D. SUTTON,  Chairman,  Department  of  Conservation,  State of Louisiana, Baton Rouge, La.  DEAR MR.  SUTTON: Martin Exploration  Company, one of the State's most active and  aggressive oil and gas producers, hereby re quests that you cancel the 11 drilling per mits that your office has previously granted  us, effective immediately. These permits in volve drilling costs of $10,000,000 and 130,000  feet of hole and represent 11 wells which were  to be drllled during the next few months,  possibly  in  time  to  impact on our coming  winter energy needs.  In addition, Martin Exploration is suspend ing  its plans  for 23 other wells,  together  representing additional drllling costs of $21,000,000 and an additional 268,000 feet of hole.  These wells, essentially all of which are po tential gas wells, were budgeted for year-end.  Martin Exploration believes that it has no  alternative but to take such action in view  of  the extremely naive and  tragically m conceived Carter energy plan which, if en acted, will reduce incentives for producers to  an -uneconomic level.  In Martin's case, every single well  it ts  cancelling was planned and the  leases ac quired on the presumption that President  Carter's free market promise for undedicated  gas would be kept and we could expect a  price equal to at least the risk discounted  replacement cost (approximately $2.25/MCF  with  15%/year  escalation)  for  such  gas.  President Carter's proposal  rolls back our  anticipated price to $1.42/MCF {which ls it self subject  to a  further rollback  to $.52/  MCF)  !or wells drilled either within 2 Y:z  miles of or less than 1000 feet deeper than  another producing well. Not only do all of  Martin's wells fall into this category, but so  do more than 95 % of all wells drilled in the  onshore and State owned offshore areas of  south Louisiana, our country's most prolific  gas producing area. The Carter policy thereby  writes this area off completely, and in effect  withholds from the consumer major gas re serves needed now.  If the producer is freed from the rigors of  controls and if he could expect free market  wellhead prices  that  justified his risk and  expense, our current oil and gas shortage  would be substantially relieved as producer  activity and efficiency would sharply increase.  By virtue of having such essential incentives,  we could then reasonably expect recoverable  domestic oil and gas supplies to last well into  the next century at prices  cheaper  than  available from our alternate energy sources,  thereby solving our current energy problem  and effecting a smooth transition from the  oil and gas age to the next.  Our once bold and magnificent oil and gas  industry is today emasculated and in com plete chaos. Producers are scared. It ls impos sible to plan. We are afraid to drill because  our production might be confiscated through  taxation, price rollbacks or contract inter vention. Today's grand plans are ~ ..>morrow's  ",1977

257,,95,-0.451,188,18,Mr. FARY.," Mr. Speaker, having some  time during  legislative debates,  I  reThursday, June 30, 1977  HON.  JOHN G. FARY  OF  ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  in  cently had an opportunity to examine  Thomas Jefferson's original draft of the  Declaration of Independence on display  in Statuary Hall here in the Capitol.  I  imagine  that few Americans have  read the Declaration of Independence in  its entirety,  let alone  read Jefferson's  original handwritten draft.  Reading this timeless document, and  recalling  the history of its enactment,  made me ponder about a number of  similarities in the Congress in 1776 and  today-1977.  It is some of these similarities that I  would like to share with my colleagues  as they are especially pertinent as the  Fourth of July draws near.  Getting a measure through Congress  today is not an easy task-nor was it in  1776. When Delegate Richard Henry Lee  of Virginia introduced his bold resolu tion on June 7th demanding ""That these  United Colonies are, and of right ought  to be,  free  and  independent States,""  about half of the colonies were in favor  of it. The issue was most controversial.  So, Congress postponed a decision, and  later recessed for 3 weeks.  Delegate Thomas Jefferson meanwhile  was commissioned to draft a declaration  of  independence  in case  it should be  needed. The four pages of this draft that  we see today in Statuary Hall is Jeffer son's original draft bearing the correc tions made by Benjamin Franklin and  John Adams.  However, before  the Congress could  consider Jefferson's proposed declara tion of independence, Delegate Lee's Re solution of Independence had to be re solved. Like we do today, the Congress  then debated and argued.  After many amendments and after the  most momentous and critical debate ever  in the history of the Congress, the Re solution of Independence was passed on  July 2, 1776. Our bonds with Great Brit ain were severed.  Independence was a  fact, and our Nation was born.  However, before the Resolution of In dependence could pass, several opponent.5  chose not to attend Congress on July 2  when the critical vote was  taken. The  result was that 12 States voted in favor,  with New York abstaining.  The delegates in the 1776 Continental  Congress had to justify their actions to  their constituents, to the world, and to  future generations. So, with the essen tial question of  independence  settled,  Congress  immediately began  to debate  Jefferson's propased Declaration of In dependence.  After long hours of debating, arguing,  defending, and amending the Declaration  of Independence, Congress voted in the  late afternoon of  July 4  to adopt  it.  The vote again was 12 States for  the  adoption of the Declaration of Independ ence. New York was still abstaining while  awaiting  for  instructions  from  their  State's authorities.  Just as there is  today, there was di vision and differing of opinion  in the  United States in 1776. What we enact  here in Congress never meets with the  complete  approval  of  the American  people. Our daily mail reflect that fact.  Such was the case with the issue of inde pendence in 1776.

258,,95,-0.223,201,18,Mr. BRECKINRIDGE.," Mr. Speaker, on  the 11th of May, Dr. Jay Forrester of the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  spoke to over 50 of our colleagues as part  of the ""Dialogues on America's Future""  series sponsored by  the Congressional  Clearinghouse on the Future.  Professor Forrester  is  a  pioneer  in  computer technology and is founder of  the Systems Dynamics Group at MIT.  He enlightened and enlivened us, Mr.  Speaker, as he urged us in the Congress  to view our problems more wholistically.  I am delighted to have the opportunity  to insert into the RECORD  today part II  of the transcript of our session with Dr.  Forrester. And  I urge all of our col lea~ues to read it.  The  text of  the second half of his  presentation follows:  TRADE AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICS  During  the  last  long wave of economic  change, political empires collapsed, to be re placed by business and investment links be tween developed and developing countries.  But the investment relationship is now be coming as strained as was the political link  a  few decades ago. Loans have been made  that cannot be  repaid,  investments have  been made th:it can not be recovered. Just  as the political links snapped, so should we  expect the financial links to break in a wave  of defaults and expropriations. Again  the  context for understanding is the long wave  of economic change, not the business cycle.  The economic and political challenge  is  to understand how present nolicies affect fu ture well-being. Policies that favor the im mediate future often set the stage for later  difficulties. Our socio-political system is not  22153  well equipped to deal with the most impor tant tradeoffs. There are  tradeoffs between  sectors. There are tradeoffs between the pres ent and the future. The tradeoffs arise out  of interactions between different parts of the  social system. Yet, neither government nor  the private sector are well equipped for ""put ting it all together"" to understand how ap parently  desirable  individual  policies  are  interacting to produce unanticipated stress.  We must develop a willingness and  the  methods for looking further allead. The life  cycle of growth has reached a point where  the fundamental nature of the economic fu ture is changing; new kinds of tradeoffs must  be made;  two hundred years of folklore  is  being reshaped. The 50-year long wave seems  to have again brought us to a critical peak;  a period of stagnation threatens; a  techno logical era is ending. It is time to plan for  the second half of the life cycle of growth in  which environmental limits force a compro mise between population and standard of  living. It is  time to look across a potential  next valley in the 50-year and lay founda tions for a new society based on new tech nology and new patterns of living.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  Q. What  is the solution  to  the kind of  growth we have now when every thirty years  the population doubles?  A. Population  is not as serious as most  people imply. We can control it if we choose  to, but we need to create a system that ls  not coercive. We still  live on the attitude  that we want more people, and so we uncon sciously coerce people to have children.  We have two cases since World War II of  two countries (Japan and an Eastern Euro pean country) which  tried  to  limit  their  population. But  they suddenly got  fright ened that they wouldn't have enough peo ple to run the industries in the country, and  both of them reversed their position on child  bearing. Jn  fact,  they began  to encourage  people to have more children.  We won't reach  a  stable population  in  early 2000. The population rate is fifty per cent of the national growth rate. We need  to face the issue, and make it a social, polit. ical, self-interest kind of issue.  Q. We are spending nine percent of our  GNP on military equipment and supplies.  How can we deal with that kind of expendi ture?  A. The military area is out of control and  out of perspective. We have seen the threat  a.s coming from the outside, but really the  stresses that are the most dangerous to us  are going to come from the inside. A ques tion that I often raise is ""Can we maintain  internal order if we suddenly move into a  period  like  the  1930's unexpectedly?"". No  effort or money is being spent to understand  these interior problems. Yet their potential  for upsetting us is far greater than an ex ternal threat.  Balance of military/social  Q. How should we redistribute our funds  so that the military and the social/economic  issues are addressed fairly?  A. There is now no place in our national  government to deal with the social and eco nomic issues and their interrelationships. I  have a strong belief that somehow or other  we have gotten the sense that nothing can  be done, so nothing ls done. Things just go  on. If we thought we would be invaded in  ten or twenty years or next week, we would  set up a terribly efficient, interrelated system  to try to stave off invasion. We would test  many alternatives. r am saying that we are  faced with the same threat in our social and  economic spheres, but we don't do anything  about it. We don't understand  the threat  and we don't know how to cope with it, and  so we ignore it and go on.  Q . After World War II,  the demand for  capital brou~ht us prosperity.

267,Senate,95,-0.435,253,18,Mr. SARBANES.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  to express my serious misgivings  about the nomination of Robert Nooter  to be the Deputy Administrator of the  Agency for International Development.  In doing so, there is no need to diminish  the public service which Mr. Nooter has  rendered to his country, or to question  his qualifications as a professional ad ministrator.  It  is  only  necessary  to  underscore the fa.ct that the position to  which he is being appointed is the No. 2  position in the Agency for International  Development and that he will therefore  stand as the alter ego  to the Admin istrator in a critioa.l policymaking posi tion. It is,  therefore,  relevant,  indeed  essential, to examine Mr. Nooter's policy  positions over the years and the record  which he has established. It is a record  that ought to raise serious questions in  the minds of thoughtful Members.  In the first place, Mr. Nooter has been  committed  to  the approach of heavY  capital developments projects, commod ity import programs, and the ""trickle down"" theory of economic development.  This  is an approach about which  the  Congress has  raised  serious questions  opting  instead  in favor of new direc tions, with  people-oriented  assistance  and with an emphasis on private volun tary agencies and international assist ance agencies, both of which have con sistently run into difficulties in dealing  with AID in  those areas in which Mr.  Nooter has had responsibility.  Second, it is particularly appropriate  to ask the question that has been voiced  by the distinguished Senator from Mas sachusetts with respect to new  initia tives  taken by Mr. Nooter during his  tenure. There are none on the record.  One of the major new initiatives taken  in the aid field has been the consequence  of congressional interest and action as  seen  in the development of  the  light  capital  technology approach put  for ward by Representative CLARENCE LONG,  the  distinguished Congressman  from  Maryland. Because  of Representative  LoNG's leadership the Con~ has made  clear that it views  light capital  tech nology as a new and important focus of  U.S. foreign aid and development policy.  Third, Mr. Nooter has been slow  implementing  refugee  assistance pro grams as has been detailed by both Sen ator PELL  and Senator KENNEDY who  have both played such a significant role  in seeing  that  the United States  re sponds to pressing humanitarian needs in  conformity with the best instincts of our  people. Mr. Nooter has often proceeded  with a  reluctance which has undercut  and diminished the opportunity for the  United States to demonstrate its human itarian concern,--opportunities  to pro vide humanitarian assistance devoid of  political considerations and setting an  important example for others to follow.  Fourth, in the area of human rights,  questions are obviously raised about one's  total commitment when the record in  the past has been a policy of  reluc tanc~indeed,  resistanc~to such an  emphasis in our foreign policy. On De cember 4,  1975,  testifying before  the  House Committee on Appropriations on  the question of human rights, Mr. Nooter  stated:  The whole question of human right&  is an extremely difficult one, and there  in  ",1977
268,Senate,95,-0.169,396,18,Mr. STONE.," I yield.  Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I not  only agree with  the statements made  by both the distinguished Senator from  Florida who ha.s offered the amendment  and my colleague from Idaho who has  just spoken in support of  the amend ment, but wish  to add my own com ments.  I point out that at pages 98 and 99 of  the committee report in the additional  views  that several of us  filed on his  measure, we  included  the  letter from  ERDA supporting this kind of an ini tiative, showing that it can be done and  that this is the way to do it.  We made  several provisions  in  the  committee deliberations  for movement  in this direction. I believe the language  offered by the Senator from Florida not  only strengthens and sharpens the focus,  but also adds further weight to the idea  that the Senate wants this kind of ac tion to be taken, and that this body has  spoken very directly on it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that that portion of the additional  views appearing on pages 98 and 99 be  printed in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection, the excerpt  from the committee report was ordered  to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:  the  5. The  Importance  of Continuing  CRBRP for Nonproliferation:  In a letter dated March 9, 1977, to Chair man Walter Flowers of the House Subcom mittee on Fossil and Nuclear Energy Re search  and  Development,  from  Robert  Thorne, Acting Assistant Administrator for  Nuclear Energy, ERDA stated the following  in response to the subcommittee's questions:  if  A. That foreign breeder plants and their  proposed scale-up follow-ons will not meet  the nonproliferation objectives based on cur rent U.S.  thinking, in terms of the specific  technologies, such as, the types of core de signs and fuel.  B. That it was possible to develop a plu tonium economy which could be considered  acceptable from both a nonproliferation and  an energy supply standpoint by the use of co processing  or  highly  radioactive  recycle  fuels. The letter suggested assessing energy  center concepts and working on  the de velopment  of  these  ""technological  fixes""  while continuing our ongoing R&D programs.  C. That to date, ERDA has seen no evidence  that other nations which have breeder re actors  and  reprocessing  programs  have  undertaken any significant technological de velopment  efforts  to  reduce  the  nuclear  weapons  proliferation  potential  of  their  facilities. And, further,  that based on past  experience, ERDA would  expect  that ad vanced safeguards instrumentation and proc essing developments by  the U.S. would be  ut111zed by foreign natlons. The example was  offered that the U.S. has requests from France  and Russia for some of our equipment still in  the development stage. In other words, U.S.  technologicail  improvements  for  nonprolif eration probably will be the only  improve ments available.  D. ERDA agreed that if the United States  does not develop more proliferation-resist ant technologies, they probably will not be  developed  by other nations,  and  even  there might be such developments by others,  they would not be developed as rapidly.  E. In the LMFBR program that the reactor  plant and engineering which require the ma jority of funds for plant, component develop ment, systems development and materials de velopment are not effected regardless of what  type of nonproliferation requirements might  be evolved. This suggests strongly that con tinuing  those  activities while parallelling  them with nonproliferation efforts  is a ra tional and well-reasoned approach.  F. That U.S. Actions can have significant  influence over the actions of other nations  when the U.S. actions are perceived to be in  the best interest of them, such as, when a  U.S. development program produces an ad vanced  reactor or  reprocessing  technology  offering improved economics or resource con servation. This, again, suggests that an in corporation of nonproliferation advances in a  U.S. development advanced reactor or reproc essing  technology could have  the greatest  influence on the programs of other nations.  G. That it is possible to develop nonprolif eration acceptable reprocessing technology.  H. That the United States will be in a  poorer bargaining position in carrying out  our bilateral cooperative agreements, which  are based on quid pro quo information ex changes  (where we  understand  problems  have already been experienced.)  I. That foreign nuclear programs treat pro liferation issues primarily from  the stand point of improving safeguards, rather than  by attempting to develop and  incorporate  technology  advances  designed  to provide  greater proliferation resistance.  ERDA Acting Administrator Robert Fri was  asked in a hearing before the Senate Energy  Research and Development Subcommittee by  Senator McClure if the statements in the let ter were valid, notwithstanding the April 7th  policy  statement. He  answered  in  the  affirmative.  In light of these statements and the ob vious conclusion that the most effective way  to influence the programs of other nations ls  to proceed with a  technology development  program with proliferation resistance char acteristics  incorporated within the system,  it is difficult to understand the Administra tion now suggests that we stop our develop ment. It is obvious that it be better to pro ceed in a parallel manner with both breeder  and reprocessing development and prollfera tion motivated R. & D., and attempt to merge  them for either foreign or domestic com mercialization, as appropriate, to satisfy all  policy objectives, includng energy supply and  nonproliferation.

273,House,95,0.496,578,18,Mr. ARCHER.," Mr. Speaker, I appre ciate thts opportunity to once again call  attention to the pressing need to remove  Federal price controls from petroleum  and natural gas produced in this coun try.  It is inconceivable to me that the ma jority in this Congress can continue to  ignore economic reality and instead play  pure politics with this Nation's energy  supply. The logic calling for deregula tion of oil and gas prices  is unshake able--as I and others have repeatedly  noted in this Chamber for many years.  Unfortunately, whatever notions we  might have had of a statesmanlike ap proach  to our energy dilemma seems  once again to be dissolving into a sea of  petty partisan politics and selfish per sonal political considerations.  President Carter well knows this po litical  reality. During  his  campaign,  when the critical votes of gas producing  States were highly in doubt, he gave his  oral and written pledge to work with the  Congress to bring about deregulation of  natural gas. Now, after the votes from  those States helped put him in office, new  political considerations have apparently  caused  the now President  call  for  greater regulation of both natural gas  and oil. Political expediency, not eco nomic fact, is apparently the most im portant consideration.  Regrettably, it is actions like this that  have worked to twist the issue of Federal  price controls into a divisive, geograph ically fractionalizing, topic of debate.  The debate should not put the pro ducing States  against  the consuming  States. We need not, and must not, pit  the economic plight of consumers in one  part of the country against that of con sumers in another area-with the victor  receiving the spoils of artifically lower  prices at the expense of the loser.  Mr. Speaker, this is what has actually  happened historically in the case of nat ural gas-and it is time we jut an end  to it.  Deregulation of natural gas will, as  long-term contracts expire and new con tracts are written, gradually equalize the  price of natural gas paid by consumers  throughout the country. Even more im portant,  it will provide  the means  to  finance  the ever-increasing high costs  of discovering, and developing, additional  sources of gas which can help us bridge  the gap between now and the time when  other fuels can take on a major share  of the energy burden.  The case for decontrol of petroleum  is equally strong. Incredibly, we are now  importing nearly one-half of our crude  oil-whereas we were importing just over  a third of it at the time of the Arab oil  embargo. Domestic price controls con tinue to stifle development of our petro leum reserves at a time when we have no  choice but to produce more.  Artificial tax gimmicks to increase the  price paid by consumers for petroleum  products only speak to one side of the  equation-consumption.  They do nothing  to stimulate addi tional production that must go hand in  hand with conservation as long as our  society remains dependent upon oil and  natural gas for the overwhelming ma jority of its fuel needs.  The Congress is far from finished with  its consideration of the National Energy  Act. There is sufficient time  to  indeed  make it an effective means for achieving  an energy program which the American  people can believe in and depend upon  to get us through this period of shortage  and into a secure energy future.  Partisan  politics must  be  shoved  aside-and the overall good of our en tire Nation must be our overriding con cern.  The imposition of Federal price con trols on oil and natural gas helped cre ate the shortage we are now facing as a  Nation-and  their  immediate elimina tion must be an  integral part of any  comprehensive program to cure it.  The facts are clear. Everyone in this  Chamber knows  them. The  remaining  question is whether or not a responsible  majority of our Members will take this  long-awaited, necessary action.  ",1977
274,House,95,0.508,578,18,Mr. ARMSTRONG.," Mr. Speaker,  I  commend the gentleman from Oklahoma  <Mr. EDWARDS)  for his efforts  to em phasize the importance of free market  pricing to cope with the Nation's energy  shortage. Deregulation of oil and natural  gas pricing will do more to alleviate our  fossil fuel shortages than any one single  step.  Yet this one step is being fought tooth  and nail by those who feel that energy  solutions  lie  in  the fairyland of more  and more bureaucracy and regulations.  Within the past 4 years Congress has  created the Federal Energy Administra tion to regulate oil producers and con sumers;  in turn, FEA has promulgated  regulations which make a pile 3 feet  high; 10,000 Government employees have  been hired to interpret and enforce these  regulations and, awful, thought, to think  up new regulations.  The result of  this frenzy of Federal  activity is as depressing as it is obvious:  In  1976,  domestic  oil  consumption  reached an all-time high, but domestic  oil production dropped  to  the  lowest  level since 1961;  imported oil averaged  42 percent of U.S. petroleum consump tion,  and  at  times  during  the  year  accounted for half of U.S. consumption;  since 1972 the dollar costs of imported oil  have jumped from $4.3 billion to $34.6  billion in 1976; yet petroleum accounts  for a greater percentage of U.S. energy  use now than it did in 1970-up from 44  p£:rcent to 46 percent.  The United States is using more and  more petroleum each year. But we are  producing less and importing an increas ing proportion of our needs from over seas sources, primarily from the OPEC  nations.  In the last 5 years, U.S. production has  declined from a daily average of 9.5 mil lion barrels to 8.1 million barrels in 1976.  Consumption rose from about 15 million  barrels daily in 1970 to 17.3 million bar rels  in  1972. The  embargo  reduced  demand somewhat, but the daily average  rose to a new high of 17 .4 million barrels  by the end of 1976.

275,,95,0.183,643,18,Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois.," Mr. Speak er, Congressman BARRY M. GOLDWATER,  JR., has submitted a  penetrating and  perceptive analysis to his fellow mem bers of the Ad Hoc Committee on Energy  regarding the Clinch River breeder reac tor. He argues that the choice to build  a breeder demonstration plant  in  the  United States does not necessarily lead  to the proliferation of nuclear weapons  around the world, as the administration  suggests. Instead, he points out that the  real challenge we  face  is  to come  to  agreement with other nations on how to  intelligently control the use of nuclear  fuels, extracting the maximum amount  of energy from them, but at the same  time preventing illicit use for military  purposes. I am fully in accord with this  approach.  Mr.  Speaker,  as  ranking minority  member of the Ad Hoc Energy Commit tee, I would like to share Congressman  GOLDWATER'S views on breeder reactors  with  the full membership of  this dis tinguished body. I am therefore insert ing the text of his letter to the com mittee in the RECORD.  I urge all Mem bers  to examine  the approach he has  suggested, and to support the full fund ing level of $150 million for the Clinch  River breeder reactor when the ERDA  authorization bill  (H.R. 6796)  is con sidered by the House.  Mr. GOLDWATER'S letter follows:  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  Washington, D.C., July 11, 1977.  All MEMBERS,  Ad Hoc Committee on Energy, U.S. House  of Representatives, Washington, D.C.  DEAR COLLEAGUE:  I am writing to you as  fellow members of the Ad Hoc Energy Com mittee since we have a special interest and  responsibility  in assuring  that  the nation  has adequate future supplies of energy. My  particular concern at this time is the situa tion with regard to the Clinch River Breeder  Reactor which will soon be considered by the  House when  the ERDA Authorization bill  comes up for Floor action. I  intend to sup port continued design and construction of  the CRBR and believe you should do  the  same.  In recent days, we have seen several ""Dear  Colleague"" letters come out on the subject  and I am aware there will be more. I don't  intend to repeat all the arguments we are  now hearing for and against nuclear power,  for and against the breeder reactor program,  and for and against the key plant in that  program-the CRBR. What I would like to  do is suggest that these arguments boil down  to one simple issue : the need for energy ver sus the need to control the proliferation of  nuclear weapons.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Very briefly, the breeder reactor, as a de vice capable of producing material that can  be used in nuclear weapons, has been termed  a  threat to our efforts to control weapons  proliferation.  It has  therefore been  sug gested that by deferring the lead facllity in  our breeder program, namely the CRBR, the  U.S. will clearly signal its serious desire to  control proliferation. Other countries will  supposedly follow suit and a major threat  to world peace will be overcome. The penalty  of this approach on our ability to meet fu ture energy needs by use of breeder reactors  is considered by some to be of secondary im portance  to  the overriding  concern  over  proliferation.  Now I don't intend to argue whether pro liferation or energy needs is the more critical  issue. The former has been described as the  most pressing problem facing mankind to day; the latter has been termed a crisis which  must be addressed with the moral equivalent  of war. One could argue either way. What I  do want to address is the likely consequence3  of the course of action the Administration  has chosen and explore the ramifications of  those consequences.  If we do not build the CRBR, we will surely  delay the availability of breeder reactors by  at least five years and likely much  longer.  At the same time, the U.S. will lose whatever  advantage it has in advanced reactor tech nology and any ability we may have to influ ence the actions taken in this area by other  nations. Skilled technical teams will be dis banded, perhaps never  to be  reassembled.  A m!l.jor energy option will for all practical  purpo!:es be placed on the back burner with  the light dimmed. There ls no question that  we will suffer substantial losses if we cancel  the CRBR.  What do we gain in its place? The U.S. will  have sent out a ""signal"" of our intent to con trol proliferation, a signal that other nations  have already  indicated they will not heed.  Even if they should do so, other technologies  with perhaps even greater potential for the  production of nuclear weapons material will  remain or soon be  in wide-scale use; our  noble sacrifice in accepting unilateral energy  disarmament may well be for naught.  The point I believe we as members of the  Ad Hoc Committee should be concerned with  is that the Administration is attempting to  impose a foreign poll.cy constraint ( concern  over proliferation) over our ability to opti mize the development of a new energy source.  I do not believe that the two concerns are  mutually exclusive-there is no reason why  we cannot solve one problem if we act inde pendently  to solve  the other. Specifically,  there are various  international  initiatives  that can be taken to safeguard nuclear mate rials that do not require or in any way justify  the deferral of an important domestic energy  project such as  the Clinch River Breeder  Reactor.  I am convinced that this Nation needs the  advanced nuclear option and that the CRBR  represents the best means for us to achieve it.  I am also convinced that the reasons we now  see raised against the Clinch River Reactor  are invalid and should not be heeded. I com mented on this subject at greater length in a  ""Dear Colleague"" letter to all members of the  House dated June 22, 1977, which I would  again call to your attention.  In conclm:ion, I submit that the members  of  the Ad Hoc Energy Committee have a  unique concern in assuring that energy sup plv policy matters are not subordin'3.ted to  other imoortant issues in the establishment  of national priorities. This is particularly so  when the ""other isc;ues"" represent a failure  or refu.,al of the national leadership to solve  those other problems in their proper context.  I  tt>erefore ur~e that you suoport full fund ing for the Clinch River Breeder Reactor in  the ERDA Authorization bill. H.R. 6796, soon  to be con .. ldered by the House. and th!l.t you  bring this matter to the attention of other  22595  of our colleagues who may not have our spe cial perspective on energy.

LAGOMARSINO  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 12, 1977  ",1977
276,,95,0.378,643,18,Mr. LAGOMARSINO.," Mr. Speaker, I  would like to bring to the attention of  my colleagues the following commentary  written by John P. Roche. Mr. Roche  writes about the administration's inter est in normalizing relations with Viet nam  and  apparent  disinterest  in  unresolved  issues  still  facing our  two  countries.  The article follows:  INDOCHINA  REFUSING To PuLL DOWN THE  SHADES  (By John P. Roche)  At a recent meeting in New York, Allard K.  Lowenstein, who has been playing ""Tonto""  to Andy Young's ""Lone Ranger,"" objected  when a  friend of mine raised the  issue of  human  rights  in  its  Indochinese context.  The gist of Al's message was that we should  all drop  the ""divisive"" subject of Vietnam  and move forward into a smiling future.  How charming. While  the Khmer Rouge  is ruthlessly engaged in what an impartial  French observer called ""self-genocide,"" with  at least a  fifth of the population dead or  dying; while the South China Sea is dotted  with tiny craft full of Vietnamese, who have  adopted New Hampshire's motto ""Live Free  or Die"" and are mostly dying; while, in short,  Indochina  is an abattoir, Lowenstein sug gests we forget it. Vietnam is part of a bad  old past, one which saw Americans divided;  the response is drop that reel from the his torical film.  Al's offer to let us all off the historical hook  is not without a certain disingenuous qual ity. Wasn't  it Egyptian President Anwar  Sadat who embraced Secretary of State Kis singer in the wake of the 1973 Yorn Kippur  War and said, ""Why don't we just tell Israel  to let bygones be bygones?"" Well, I'm one  stubborn old social democrat who isn't going  to pull down the shades: It was Lowenstein  and his pals in the ""Dump Johnson"" move ment who played a  tragic role  in  turning  Indochina into a totalitarian inferno.  True, I can't rewrite history: We lost. The  basic ingredient in our defeat was isolation ist--Americans don't like fighting  intermi nable wars at the end of the world for murky  objectives. However, what Lowenstein & Co.  did was mount a major campaiO'n to obscure  the fundamental  issue  in South Vietnam:  defending the freedom of decent people from  a. branch of ""Murder, Inc."" In fairness, he  was never a ""Hanoi hawk,"" one of those who  advocated victory for the ""progressive North  Vietnamese.""  He and his associates orchestrated a dif ferent theme:  the dictatorial corruption of  the Thieu regime. In essence  they blurred  the line between North and South, reinforc in~ 1!1  this country the Pavlovian reaction  that it didn't really make any difference who  won. Of course, the Thieu regime was cor ruot, but corruption there was simply old fashioned stealing, not the infinitely worse  corruption of the soul one finds in totalitari an societies. Sure, Thieu's government was  dictatorial in aspiration, and its police were  perhaps half as rough as the Mexican, yet its  real problem was weakness.

278,,95,0.612,656,18,Mr. ASHBROOK.," Mr. Speaker, when  official visitors tour the People's Republic  of China, they find a nation that has  been carefully groomed and prepared  for  their  inspection. They never meet  people who  can  express  a  ""minority  opinion."" They never meet  the  ''class  enemies/' men and women who battle  against the party machine for reasons  as various as a faith in Buddhism or a.  taste for blue jeans.  They hear nothing of tragic suicides  under pressure from criticizing comrades  or the ticket touts who make a living in  big cities.  In short, visitors  to Red China are  brainwashed,  to borrow a phrase from  George Romney. The American public is  being brainwashed by the liberal media  which would never apply the same stand ard to the Communist dictators who have  selectively murdered millions of people  that they apply to President Park of Ko rea or Ian Smith of Rhodesia. No; to the  American liberal establishment, China is  private property and they will tell you  exactly what they want you to think.  On the other hand, once in a while we  do get some honest  journalism. Isabel  Hilton lived in Peking and Shanghai for  2 years and came to know some of China's  private life-the hidden dissenters who  disturbed the peace of the party. In the  London Sunday Times on June 12, 1977  she wrote a very interesting story profil ing some of China's odd men out. I urge  my colleagues to read this story in the  hope that they will start to see the other  side:  THE HIDDEN SmE OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC THE BI'ITER JOBLESS YEARNING FOR  JEANS  AND  JAZZ  On a Shanghai street, near  the station,  there is a column of marching teenagers. It's  not an unusual sight, and it's not unusual  that  they sing as  they march. Toe  song  sounds like ""The East Is Red,"" China's great  revolutionary song. But nobody is joining in.  Listening, I realize why. The words are not  the official eulogy to Mao, but a highly un authorised version. Embarrassed officials try  to stop the song.    Small children love annoying those officials  and interpreters-taunting them with street  songs about  their  leather shoes and  their  high-handed manners. Rhymes about big nosed foreigners with large wallets dissolve  into giggles as the outraged guides turn on  the kids.  For those guides are required to present  the official view of China. They stage-manage  the tours !or journalists and diploma.ts. But  another reality keeps breaking through their  careful public relations exercise. It can be as  simple as a young man in shades who plays  a home-made guitar in the park; or a well dressed, well-educated man in a restaurant  ",1977

280,House,95,-0.483,747,18,Mr. LEHMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I am de lighted to have this opportunity to dis cuss the senior intern program. Two of  my constituents, Dr. Charles Kadison  and his wife, Elizabeth, came to Wash ington  in May  to participate  in  this  extraordinary 2-week program.  Each day we received glowing reports  of the many conferences and tours which  were scheduled to give the interns a bet ter understanding of the Federal Gov ernment and how it affects the lives of  our senior citizens. These active older  Americans had the opportunity to come  together and discuss their common prob lems  and  explore  possible  solutions.  Among the many topics were social se curity, services to the needy elderly and  volunteerism. It was especially appro priate that the group was able to visit the  Social Security Administration in Bal timore, an agency upon which so many  elderly are dependent for income assist ance and payment for medical care.  a  result of  their  experience  in  Washington, the Kadisons are now plan ning to become volunteers in some of the  elderly day care centers which are pro vided for in title XX of the Social Se curity Act. Recently, they wrote me that  ""Up until the time we attended this pro gram in Washington, we had no knowl edge of 1Jhe many activities and benefits  available to our elderly neighbors.""  The growth of this program over the  last few years has been phenomenal, and  the time has come to formally establish  the senior intern program in legislation.  This will allow for even greater partici pation among Members and afford an in creasing number of senior citizens  to  learn more about their Government.  ",1977
281,House,95,-0.324,747,18,Mr. CORNELL.," Mr. Speaker,  I was  pleased to participate this year in the  senior citizen intern program and to pro vide the opportunity for one of my con stituents to see firsthand how the Gov ernment conducts its business.  Mrs. Olga Getts from Deerbrook, Wis.,  accepted my invitation to participate in  the 2-week session. Since she had never  traveled further east than Illinois, com ing to Washington was quite an experi ence for Mrs. Getts. With the compan ionship of other senior citizens and the  programs provided for them, it certainly  took her little time to become acclimated,  however, and to feel at home in our Na tion's Capital.  Mrs. Getts' experiences  indicate  the  value of this 2-week program. As a re sult of the meetings and seminars she at tended, my constituent has a far better  understanding of legislation that affects  our senior citizens. She left Washington  with many ideas that she felt could bene fit Wisconsin's older Americans. As Mrs.  Getts noted  in a  letter  to me,  ""The  knowledge the interns gained could be  used not only  in our own areas, but  wherever we go.""  I believe it is important for our con stituents, whatever their age, to under stand the workings of a congressional of fice and to observe firsthand how their  Government  functions. My own year round congressional intern program pro vides  such  an  opportunity  for  our  ~  younger citizens. I wondered how such a  program would work for our older Amer icans and now, judging from the reaction  of my first senior intern, I am pleased to  have had the opportunity to participate  in such a worthwhile project. Congress man HILLIS and his staff are indeed to  be commended for the extensive work in volved in coordinating such a program  and I trust the success of this effort will  justify cont.:.nuance and enlargement of  the program.

Since  President Carter  is  tentative  enough  in his own decision to require  further study of this issue, I think the  Congress should deny  the funds until  we have all of the facts ourselves. We  need to fully consider the tactical, stra tegic and diplomatic aspects of neutron  warheads before we can properly decide  on funding.  ",1977
283,,95,0.495,864,18,Mr. GARN.," Mr. President, one of the  most common criticisms of energy use in  this country is that it was wasteful. In  support of that charge, critics often point  out that other countries use far less en ergy per capita than the United States.  As Peter Brennan, former Secretary of  La,bor, points out in a criticism of Amory  Lovins ""Energy Strategy: The Road Not  Taken?"" such criticisms ignore the fact  that the United States also produces an  enormous percentage of  the food and  other goods  consumed by  the world's  people. If Americans were to reduce their  energy consumption by 40 percent,  to  each the level of consumption in Sweden,  the world would immediately be beset by  shortages of food and other necessaries.  As Mr. Brennan puts it, ""simple-minded  comparisons of countries whose cultures,  economies, and sizes are  tremendously  different make for dramatic but useless  conclusions.""  I ask unanimous consent that the essay  by Mr. Brennan be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection,  the essay  was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,  as follows:  THE SOFT PATH, THE YELLOW BRICK RoAD,  AND PIE-IN-THE-SKY  (By Peter Brennan)  Anyone concerned with jobs and a healthy  economy, and the energy needed to assure  both for this nation, should find the Lovins  If  if  approach an elaborate blueprint for disaster.  He would substitute pie-in-the-sky energy  schemes of modest potential for proven, re liable, bread-and-butter energy technologies.  And  while  his  ""unconventional""  energy  sources may hold promise, they cannot and  will not be able  to shoulder  the massive  burden of our energy needs, no matter how  much we  conserve, no matter how much  money  is showered upon  them, no matter  how many glowing and assertive articles are  written about them.  Lovins cites studies which show that,  America were as efficient as Sweden we could  save  at  least  a  third of our  energy.  America were more like Sweden, however, we  wouldn't export as much, or continue  to  feed so much of the world. Sweden uses on  the order of 40 % less energy per person than  Americans do, which apparently makes us  energy gluttons in Lovins' eyes. His line of  reasoning fails  to take note of the simple  fact that a large portion of the U.S. economy  is geared for export, while Sweden's is not.  Thus, with 5.3 % of the world's population,  the U.S. produces 17% of the world's grains  and cereals, 23.6% of the world's manufac tured goods, and 26.6 % of the gross world  product. This accounts in large part for the  discrepancy between Swedish and American  per capita. energy use. Indeed, in the area of  agriculture alone, which accounts for nearly  one-fifth of U.S.  energy consumption, we  have more land under production than the  entire area. occupied by Sweden! Also, Sweden  is neither a large nor suburban-oriented na tion. A big chunk of per capita energy con sumption by Americans is for gasoline. That  ls not the case in Sweden.  While  there  is certainly energy waste in  this country that can and should be elimi nated, simple-minded comparisons of countries whose cultures, economies and sizes are  tremendously different make  for dramatic  but useless conclusions.  Lovins also says that our entire technology  of proven,  reliable central station electric  power has got to go. Get rid of it. Who needs  it? It's a sty in the eye of the no-growth be holder. He overestimates and overemphasizes  all the drawbacks of this and other big tech nologies while painting a trouble-free picture  of the soft technology world to come, leaving  out anything which might give readers sec ond thoughts.  Furthermore, Lovins' energy schemes just  .can't make it on their own merits against  the competition, even with the rising costs  of  traditional energy sources. But, by  re peating over and over, ""Big is Bad,"" Lovins  and others hope that it will be believed and  clear the way for ""Small is Beautiful.""  By analogy, Lovins could assert: The Ti tanic was typical of big ships built to carry  a big passenger load. The Titanic was tradi tional technology with big risks. The Titanic  sank. Therefore, we should eliminate all big  ships and in their place only make small,  one-family, efficient, safe boa.ts for everyone  who wants to cross the ocean.  We can stubstitute small airplanes, small  buildings,  small anything, and  the argu ments would still sound the same and come  out just as ridiculous. One need not chal lenge or find  fa.ult with  large-sea.le  tech nology in order to justify smaller technolo gies. Both have their very valid place. Both  must be mutually inclusive; in simple point  of fa.ct, ea.ch depends upon the other.  If one  fascinated with  the engaging  character of the Wiza.rd of Oz,  it's unchar itable to gripe too much about him when the  curtain is pulled a.side to reveal his hand on  the  terrifying amplification system blaring  his presence. But, Mr. Lovins  is no MGM  movie character and the sham behind his  stupendous arguments warrants exposure.  is  CONSERVATION AND EIS'S  Mr. Lovins  rightly cites  the well-known  fact  that  America.  consumes  enormous  a.mounts of energy, and,  in doing so, we  waste a.  lot. Therefore, conservation will in creasingly dominate our transition to an en ergy conscious nation. But conservation will  not work unless a. balance  is achieved be tween  such  factors  as education, pricing,  regulations and acceptance.  Lovins is especially critical of the conver sion efficiencies  involved  in producing and  distributing electric power. That there a.re  losses in our electric energy use is obvious  and, to some degree, a. result of the laws of  nature, which seem to abhor efficiency. But  there are also gains in economy, reliability  and environmental protection.  Let us not forget, too, that soft pa.th en thusiasts generally do everything they can  to delay, k1ll or drive the costs up for hard  path options, while regulatory delay and bu reaucratic bungling add  immeasurably  to  costs.  I presume that Mr. Lovins would also have  ea.ch and every homeowner prepare, submit  and defend Environmental  Impact State ments  for ea.ch  self-sufficient  soft  pa.th energy source  intended for use  (e.g.,  for fluidized-bed combustion units). We will  have to have routine and ongoing inspections  to determine that the units a.re being op erated in conformity with license provisions  and standards. And,  I presume, hard pa.th  proponents will be welcome and even funded  as intervenors in soft pa.th licensing proce dures.  We will have to make sure that, in addi tion to the swollen Federal bureaucracy, we  now create an entirely new local bureauc racy to administer the ""equitable"" phasing in of  the soft pa.th era. According  to Mr.  Lovins,  local bureaucrats are more  lovable  and efficient than Federal ones.

284,,95,0.336,903,18,Mr. STEIGER.," Mr. Speaker, when the  House approved  legislation last month  which in effect repeals the Hatch Act,  many of us expressed concern that the  measure swing the pendulum too far in  the direction of politicizing the Federal  service.  Similar concern has been expressed  very well  in a  recent editorial  in  the  Portage, Wis.,  Daily  Register.  The  Register made note of  the compelling  argument made by backers of the bill  that public employees should have the  same right to participate in the process  as all other Americans have.  This argument deserves serious con sideration,  the Register  said,  but  it  stressed that there is another side of the  coin which has been ignored by support ers of the Hatch Act repeal. The editorial  pointed out the danger that public em ployees could fall victim to political pres sure and influence or that they could  have an unfair advantage in running for  office because of their position.  ""The only partisan Federal employees  should be officeholders who the public  can recall if they don't like the partisan  actions of those officeholders,"" the Regis ter said; ""The public cannot recall em ployees in the Federal service.""  I strongly endorse the editorial's sug gestion  that substantial discussion of  these issues is needed before the Senate  gives serious consideration to repeal of  the Hatch Act. The editorial offers an  excellent perspective  into  those  issues  I  and possible  ramifications of repeal.  commend it to your attention:  PuBLIC INPUT NEEDED ON HATCH ACT  REVERSAL  The House of Representatives has approved  a. measure to allow federal employees to par tlclpa te in political campaigns and to run  for political office. The b1ll reverses the Hatch  Act which prohibited federal workers from  raising funds for campaigns or for running  for state, county, or federal office.  While we a.re not unalterably opposed to  repeal of the Hatch Act, we hope the Sen ate goes very slowly and answers some ques tions which the House did not consider.  In the House,  the major argument was  that federal employees, some 2.8 mllllon of  them, a.re the only group who are shut out  of the political process in America.. Hence,  backers of the blll argue they should have  the sa.me right to participate in the process  as has every other American.  This  is  a.  compelling argument and one  which we believe deserves serious consider ation.  On the other side of the coin, the argu ments against repeal of the Hatch Act also  deserve to be thoroughly discussed.  These  arguments  include concerns over  whether  the  federal employees might not  become politicized-feeling that they have  to raise funds for their political bosses. At  present, federal employees a.re insulated from  pressure from their bosses to raise funds for  the bosses' campaigns.  Federal employees also might have an un fair advantage in running for office, particu larly  federal offices, because of  their inti mate knowledge of the federal system. Fur thermore,  potential  candidates  who  are  22855  federal employees would arm-twist t.heir col leagues to support them when, In fact, the  colleagues might wish to withhold support,  but feel that they have no choice but to ""go  a.long"" with an employee who is a. colleague  or perhaps a. supervisor.  Or  to  look a.t  the whole matter another  way, the federal service has been well served  by the fact that federal employees a.re pro fessional in their fields. Their interest ls to  serve the public. Since they a.re not subject  to public influence at the ballot box, if has  been  reasoned  that  they  should not  be  partisan. Rather,  the only partisan federal  employees should be officeholders who  the  public can recall if they don't like the parti san actions of those officeholders. The public  cannot  recall  employees  in  the  federal  service.  Before serious consideration  is given  to  Senate repeal of the Hatch Act, there needs  to be substantial discussion of these issues.  Moreover, that discussion should extend on  such public a. basis that the country really  has a.  chance  to understand the pros and  cons and express  its feelings on what role  federal  employees  should  or  should  not  possess.  POSITION ON ABORTION  HON.  IKE SKELTON  OF MISSOURI  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 13, 1977  ",1977
285,,95,-0.172,903,18,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker,  in re cent weeks I have received literally thou sands of communications from my con stituents expressing their opposition to  abortion. I want to take this opportunity  to restate my views on this subject.  Mr. Speaker, I am now, and have al ways been, personally opposed to abor tion. It is my sincere belief that life be gins at the moment of conception. I do  not believe that government, Federal or  State, should do anything to promote or  encourage abortions, particularly elec tive or nontherapeutic abortions. In my  view.  jncHscrimina.te abortion cheapens  the value of each  individual  life and  degrades society. My  record  in public  life, first as a member of the Missouri  State Senate and now as a Member of  the U.S. Congress, reflects these views.  It is for  these reasons, Mr. Speaker,  that I  joined the majority of my col leagues  in  support  of Congressman  HENRY HYDE'S amendment to the fiscal  1978 Labor/HEW  year  appropriations  bill,  offered  on  June  17,  1977. This  amendment would prohibit the use of  Federal funds  to pay for abortions or  to promote or encourage abortions.  In addition to this vote in the House,  I  am encouraged by a  recent Supreme  Court decision which holds that States  and cities do not have to spend public  funds  for abortions of an elective or  nontherapeutic nature. In so deciding,  the Court leaves the resolution of the im portant policy decision of public fund ing of abortions with the representatives  of the people. I believe the Court is cor rect in this decision, and I am pleased  that my colleagues in the House ha.ve  elected to speak on the issue again this  year.  In the future, I will continue to work  for and support legislation which pro vides  for  the proper protection of the  unborn.  ",1977
286,,95,-0.391,929,18,Mr. OTTINGER.," Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to take this time to share with  my  colleagues  a  recent Westchester  Rockland Newspaper article which high lights  the programs  and  accomplish menm of  the White Plains Child Day  Care Association.  Working with this organization  pleasure-the cooperation among staff  and parents i5 great and the progress  made by  the children  involved  just  fantastic.  The operations of  this center are a  model which others around the county  might want to emulate.  is a  is  ""UMBRELLA"" DAY CARE PLAN CALLED  ""UNIQUE""  (By Joann Undercoffler)  Small voices fill the room with questions,  laughter, chatter. Suddenly  the  lights go  off. Without batting an eye,  little people  recognize  the signal and busy  themselves  on a. cleanup detail, picking up toys, putting  books on shelves, stacking blocks  in their  rightful places.  CXXIII--1440--Part 18  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  That finished, they move a.long to a. large,  downstairs  room where  each  child  has  planned a.head whether he'll play with build ing blocks, paddle in a. water table or climb  on some apparatus.  The atmosphere is placid, broken only once  in awhile when a. youngster bumps a head  or gets the worst of a. disagreement with a.  friend. Adults speak ill quiet tones a.nd the  visitor has  tr"".>uble  figuring out who's in  charge.  A little boy wanders away from a.n ener getic constructior. crew and  indulges  in a  few peaceful moments by himself at  the  water table, filling bottles, emptying them,  filling them again . . . The teacher keeps an  eye on him waiting for the moment when  he'll be willing to return to the group.  In a. small side room, a young woman works  one-to-one with  a.  little girl who has ha.d  trouble learning to talk. The speech therapist  comes from New York University where she  is a graduate student.  All  this  is  taking place a.t St. Bartholo mew's Church  in White Plains where  the  White Plains Child Da.y Ca.re Association ha.s  one of its five day care centers. One way or  another,  the scene has  its counterparts a.t  Rochambeau School,  the Schuyler-DeKalb  public housing project, the Lakeview public  housing  project  a.nd  First  Presbyterian  Church.  This program is unique in Westchester, ac cording to Inez Singletary, executive director  of the Day Care Council of Westchester. ""Its  five different centers are under one umbrella  administration,"" she explained. ""Ea.ch center  is in an area where there is a demonstrated  need. Even though they're spread out among  five different neighborhoods, it's less costly to  have one central office.""  Each center has  its own  focus. At First  Presbyterian,  infants a.nd  toddlers under 2  receive  tender loving ca.re from a group of  warm women who love babies a.nd know what  they need; toddlers age 2 to 3 are in a special  center at Lakeview which also ca.res for 3 and  4-yea.r-olds. St. Bartholomew's, Rochambeau  and Schuyler-DeKalb are neighborhood Head  Start centers  ta.king pre-schoolers from a.ge  3. Kinderga.rtners share their services during  the afternoon.  Behind all this activity a.re a.  team and a  philosophy dedicated to the service of chil dren and their families. Lyn Yanuck, execu tive director of the White Plains Child Day  Care Association describes them: ""We believe  in peoole-children, staff' a.nd parents. 'I can  do it' is the whole program. The 3-yea.r-olds'  who come to Head Start from the infant cen ter have such a sense of themselves. They're  big shots!""  Mrs. Yanuck said the program has become  a primary agency for helping many families  in the city because of its far-reaching services  in health, psychological, dental a.nd speech  therapy areas. Instead of referring families  to outside agencies, workers come in to the  centers with  their help. This way, she ex plained, families can receive assistance in a  familiar setting among people  they know.  Educationally, children  in  the Head Start  program a.re getting Just what they need, the  director pointed out. She fiercely defended  the program against its critics.  Studies begun in the 1960s have shown that  there  is  a  ""sleeper eff'ect""-improved per formance in school which doesn't become ap parent until several years after a. Head Start  child  enters  public  school, Mrs. Yanuck  stated.  ""They are proving wrong the 1969 West inghouse study that claimed to show that  Head Sta.rt gains disappeared after the child  entered public school,"" she said. ""A Florida  study showed that by fifth grade, 30 per cent  of disadvantaged. children who hadn't ha.d  Head Start needed special education, while  in a similar group who had been through  Head Start, only one percent needed reme dial help. It's about time it was said that this  22881  kind of da.y ca.re should be considered effec tive and worthwhile.""  The director hopes to see a. da.y when the  White Plains day ca.re centers will evolve  into  neighborhood  resource  centers. They  would include day care and would also serve  as a. source of service and support for single  parents and for women who ca.re for groups  of children in their homes.  ""These women feel very isolated in their  situation,"" said Mrs. Ya.nuck. ""The young sters in home ca.re situations have the same  needs as those enrolled in our centers. We  should be able to provide health and dental  screenings to them and educational support  and help to the women in charge of these  children.""  The day ca.re director is enthusiastic a.bout  her staff and its professionalism. She is espe cially proud of the progress of some of her  teachers who started as a.ides when  their  children were part of the Head Sta.rt pro gram. Through on-the-job training and aca demic work, some are now head  teachers.  Several have been able  to buy homes be cause of the additional steady income their  work provides their families.  Money for White Plains Child Day Care is  a. ""hand-to-mouth a.ff'a.ir,'' Mrs. Ya.nuck ad mitted, although things come a  little more  easily than they used to. Funds come from  the Department  of  Social  Services,  the  United Way of Westchester,  the City of  White Plains, foundation grants and wher ever else possible. The brand new yellow  school bus, which will get heavy use, was  purchased for  the program by the regional  Head Start office, Mrs. Yanuck explained.  ""The problem is,'' she said, ""everything is  work-related. A child is funded here as long  a.s his mother has a  Job.  I.f she  loses that  job, his support is withdrawn. It's also with drawn when a  family  is over income. How  can we reward those who are working toward  self-sufficient, independent lives, instead of  penalizing their success by terminating da.y  c::i.re services?  ""We could fill our centers with children of  middle  class  families,"" Mrs. Yanuck said,  ""but our mission is to serve those in need.  The fact is that women are working and they  need care for their children. There's a. need  to provide stability for them-a. support sys tem  for mothers  alone-in other words,  neighborhood resource centers.""

Its defective instant  election day voter registration provisions  will provide an administrative night mare for State and local election offi cials.

290,House,95,-0.368,994,18,Mr. LONG of Louisiana.," Mr. Speaker,  I am a strong believer in the biblical dic tum that there is a time for everything.  I am, therefore, convinced that the time  for the creation of a permanent select  committee on intelligence has arrived.  For the past several years we have  subjected the intelligence establishment  to unusually detailed scrutiny, we have  revealed many-perhaps too many-of  its operational arrangements, and we  have brought their leaders before  this  body so frequently that a former direc tor of CIA has estimated that more than  a third of his time was spent in respond ing to Congress in some manner.  Much of the heat and sensationalism  that attended the early revelations about  the  intelligence  establishment  has  abated. The  lengthy  investigation  re vealed abuses, but it also pointed out  that the intelligence community is made  up of highly efficient and dedicated pro f essjonals. The need for a strong and  eff'ective intelligence community is be coming  increasingly clear as we enter  into an extended period of negotiations  to lessen the danger of nuclear and con ventional warfare.  For  these  reasons-both  to prevent  abuses of the system and to strengthen  our capability to verify, detect changes  in the bal~nce of power, and provide  early warning, the role of Congress needs  to be strengthened. Quite frankly our  currently fragmented approach to intel ligence oversight and budget authoriza tion lacks focus and centralized direc tion. A permanent select committee will  provide us both with the necessary focus  on  intelligence as a single entity and  with a much needed centralized oversight  authority.  We in the Rules Committee held hours  of hearings on House Resolution 658 and  reported  the proposal as drafted with  only  technical  amendments.  In  the  course of our hearings I became con vinced that the resolution was carefully  and precisely drafted  to protect  the  rights of Members of Congress t.o have  appropriate access  to information. But  the resolution also assures that regula tions to protect the security of inteUi gence information will be adopted and  diminish the possibility of leaks.  Our Nation needs a meaningful and  viable partnership between  the  intel ligence community and  the Congress.  The creation of  a House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence is an  important step in developing such a re lationship. I urge my colleagues to sup port House Resolution 658, which will  permit us  to exercise our rightful role  in the oversight of the intelligence com munity and will also assure that access  to intelligence information vital to na tional security will be properly restricted.

The kind of self doubt and self-criticism  that we are  hearing puzzles me in the face of evi dence of repeated abuses of this process,  not by us, but by the executive branch,  The Members know the sham of over sight.

292,House,95,0.3,1033,18,Mr. KEMP.," Mr. Speaker, rising unem ployment and inflation in America today  are unacceptably high, while real invest ment and aftertax incomes of Americans  are lagging. Senator RoTH of Delaware  and I,  today,  introduced  the Kennedy  tax rate cuts of the early 1960's, in order  to  combat  both  unemployment  and  inflation.  According to recent figures from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, for example,  the cost of living for middle income fami lies in the United States went up 78.9  percent between 1967 and 1976. At the  same  time, personal  income  taxes on  middle  income families went up 110.5  percent.  Perhaps even more disturbing is the  weakness of capital spending by business  for modernization of plant and equip ment, which creates  the  jobs America  needs for the future and leads to higher  real wages. Over the past several years  the rate of capacity growth in manufac turing has  slowed  considerably-from  4.6 percent between 1948 and 1968, to 4  percent between 1968 to 1973, to a cur rent level of about 3 percent. The United  States, in fact, is lagging behind nearly  all OECD countries in the rate of invest ment and is not keeping pace with our  need  to create  jobs, combat pollution  and fight inflation as well.  On  top of  this  situation, President  Carter has proposed huge tax increases  for social security and energy, the Inter nal Revenue Service wants to tax fringe  benefits, and the administration's tax re form efforts are aimed at raising taxes  on investment income and capital gains.  At the same time, inflation continues  to increase everyone's taxes daily, as in dividual  incomes  are pushed up  into  higher tax brackets. This phenomenon  has been calculated to raise individual  income tax revenues 1.5 percent for every  1 percent rise in the Consumer Price In dex. It will raise the real estate tax bur den on the American people by approxi mately $5 billion this year alone, and will  raise effective tax rates on all_ Americans  by as much as 30 percent by 1980 if un checked.  President Carter has thus far chosen  to deal with this problem largely through  rhetoric. He talks about balancing the  budget, reducing taxes, cutting inflation  and  unemployment,  and  lifting  the  burden of Government off of the Ameri can people. While I commend him for  these fine goals, I have seen very little  of substance to indicate they will ever be  met, or can ever be met in a contracting  economy.  We believe  that  immediate, decisive  action is needed to reduce taxes and get  the economy moving again, and restore  a high level of real growth and job crea tion without inflation. This can only be  done by reducing the tremendous burden  of  taxatio:1 on  the American people,  which is discouraging incentives to work,  production, saving, and investment. In creasing the after-tax reward for work  and investment will lead to an increase  in real output of goods and services, thus  creating prosperity for  the people and  more revenue for all levels of govern ment.  We cannot wait until 1979 or 1980 to  see  tax  reduction  implemented. The  American  people  and  the American  economy need it now, particularly in the  Northeast where the after-tax disposable  income of the people, adjusted for cost  of living and inflation is among the low est in the country. By lowering the Fed eral tax rates, the Northeastern States  will receive tremendous economic bene fits without penalizing other areas of the  country in the process.  President John F. Kennedy said  August 1962:  in  The single most  effective  fiscal weapon  available  to strengthen the national econ omy is the Federal tax policy. The right kind  of tax cut at the right time ls the most ef fective measure that this Government could  take to spur our economy forward. For the  facts of the matter are that our present tax  system is a drag on economic recovery and  economic growth, biting heavily  into  the  purchasing power of  every consumer.  every  taxpayer  and  I would only add that not only is our  present tax system biting into the pur chasing power of American  taxpayers  and consumers, but it is strangling the  incentives  for  investment and  saving  that are so necessary to the production  of goods and services.  To put a balanced budget ahead of full  employment without inflation is not only  cruel politics, it is poor economics.  Just as President Kennedy's tax re duction was enormously successful in the  early 1960's, we believe that a  tax rate  reduction of similar magnitude will have  similar results today. This is why I am  introducing a bill today,  together with  my colleague, Senator WILLIAM RoTH of  Delaware, to make the following tax rate  reductions:  Reduce all individual income tax rates  by an average of 30 percent over 3 years.  This will reduce the highest individual  tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent,  the lowest rate from 14 to 8 percent, and  all other rates in between by a compar able amount;  Reduce the corporate tax rate from  48 to 45 percent over 3 years; and  Immediately reduce the corporate sur tax exemption for small business from  $50,000 to $100,000.  Almost two-thirds of the tax reduction  will go  to families with adjusted gross  incomes below $30,000, 40 percent will go  to families with incomes below $20,000.  As inflation has pushed more and more  families into higher tax brackets in re cent years, more incomes have been af fected by the progressive nature of our  marginal tax structure. For instance, in  the early 1960's about 5 percent of all tax  returns were subject to the marginal tax  rate of over 30 percent. Today, nearly  one-third of all tax returns are in 30  percent tax brackets or above and it is  increasing daily.  This increase in after-tax income can  be expected to have a highly expansive  effect on the economy, as the incentive  to work, produce, and invest is encour aged. The estimated effect on employ ment and gross national product is the  following:  GNP  (Billions)  Employment  1978 -----------+$43. 4  1979  -----------+$95. 5  1980 ------------+$157.4  Source: Norman B. True, Inc.  +1. 218, 000  +2. 547, 000  +4, 000, 000  Because of  this  increase in employ ment and GNP, Government tax reve nues will  increase also. Indeed, within  a  short  time  the Government will be  collecting more  tax  revenues  than  it  would have in the absence of a tax cut,  because the tax base itself will be ex panded. This is exactly what happened  following the Kennedy tax rate reduc tion, as this table demonstrates:  Treasury estimated revenue losses:  1963 -------------------------1964 -------------------------1965 -------------------------1966 -------------------------1967 -------------------------1968 -------------------------~2.4  -5.2  ~13.3  ~20.0  ~23.7  ~24.4  Total ------------------------89.0  ",1977

317,Senate,95,-0.301,1059,18,Mr. MOYNIHAN.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the distinguished majority leader  and the distinguished minority leader for  yielding  their  time  to Senator JAVITS,  my cherished senior colleague, and my self, to take this opportunity to inform  Senators what they undoubtedly know.  At 9: 34 last night the lights in New  York City went out. Theaters, businesses,  hospitals, parks, streets, buildings of all  descriptions,  subways-were  without  power.  It has been accompanied by great tur moil, great distress, but equally by gen uinely magnificent behavior on the part  o! the people in New York State, in par ticular our firemen, our police, and our  hospitals, who operated under circum stances of all but unprecedented diffi culty, risked their lives, saved lives, and,  in a  real sense, have saved  that city  once more.  Senator JAVITs and I are very much  concerned and intend to ask the Federal  Power Commission to look into the mat ter, to see just what happened this time,  and to ask it to discover measures that  can avoid a repetition of what increas ingly takes upon itself the surreal quality  of science fiction, when a great city is  suddenly paralyzed by an  inexplicable  event.  The crisis  is easing. Electricity has  been restored to roughly 3 million people,  and it is expected tliat by 3 o'clock this  afternoon the city will be normal again.  However, it has been an altogether ab normal event which,  it seems  to us,  should concern the Federal Power Com mission and should be followed by ac tions  in  the national Government,  necessary, and certainly in the State and  local governments.  The last great power failure was  in  it blacked out not only the city,  but parts of nine Northeastern States  and eastern Canada. Fortunately,  the  power failure is not as widespread this  1965;  if  time. But it is no less serious for those  affected.  The remarkable thing about this awful  event is what remains the same. We see  at such a  time the resourcefulness and  the goodwill of our people. The actions  of men and the character of a society are  tested in such a time. Our New Yorkers  were magnificent.  By 10  last night, Mayor Beame had  declared the city to be in a state of emer gency. All  the firemen and policemen  of the city were called to duty, and they  responded extremely well to the emer gency. Fire and crime broke out as in all  such emergencies. Seven  thousand po licemen were on duty all night. As of  8 a.m.  this morning 2,000 arrests had  been made. During the same time, 576  fires were started, all are under control;  1,500 alarms were called-three  times  the usual number. Policemen and fire men risked  their lives-some were  in jured-they do this every day. What a  debt we owe them. Hospital patients were  cared for, subway riders were helped out  of  the dark  caverns,  elevator  riders  trapped in skyscrapers were freed as soon  as they could be.  Mr. President, Senator JAVITS and I  are here in Washington to do whatever  we can to help our great city. We must  find out, first of all, exactly what caused  the power failure. Then we must dis cover what measures can be  taken to  avoid a repeat. I will ask, with the dis tinguished  senior Senator  from New  York, that the Federal Power Commis sion investigate the cause of the black out and report po&:,ible remedies for any  reoccurrence.  The crisis is easing, electricity has been  restored  to  roughly  3 million people.  It is now expected that full power will  be  restored  everywhere  by  o'clock  this afternoon. Westchester County and  the Borough of Queens are already back  to normal. Sections of Brooklyn,  the  Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island  are supplied with electricity again. The  water supply for the city gets better by  the hour.  Mr. President, I once said that the art  of politics  is  learning how  to cope.  I  am proud to say that our New Yorkers  are coping wonderfully well, in the very  best tradition of our people.  ",1977

321,Senate,95,0.382,44,26,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, would the  distinguished Senator from New York  admit if we open up more jobs through  a youth opportunity bill, such as Sena tor ScHWEIKER is proposing here, that it  would expand jobs all across the section  recause  it would give a stimulation to  the economy to hire youth, even though  they are white youths? But I think, to be  lot of minority  frank, there would be a  youth hired, as well.  Incidentally, both  the distinguished  Senator from New York and  the dis tinguished Senator  from New  Jersey  have admitted here that the student pro gram works very well. The fact of the  matter is that there would be more than  40 cents, there would be about 65 cents  or 67 cents an hour here that this youth  opportunity differential would provide.  ",1977
322,Senate,95,0.084,200,26,Mr. CHAFEE.," Mr. President, my prob lem is not so much someone who is not  qualified, because I am sure you could  find qualified people through the local  bar associations. I am concerned about  giving preference to someone who might  not be willing to undertake this project  for the required length of time. In other  words, the recipient-the local organiza tion-might say, ""Look, we have had ter rible turnover in this organization, and  we really do not want to take on anyone  who is not going to commit himself to  2 years of service. We cannot have this  turnover.''  I am concerned that the amendment of  the Senator from Missouri, as I read it,  deals solely with qualified persons. There  may be plenty of qualified people who  can do the job, but who would say, ""Look,  I am not going to commit myself for 2  years; I will stay for 6 months, but you  will have  to  take your chances after  that.""  Is the  length of  time  the person  is  planning to stay to be consjdered part of  his qualifications?  ",1977

The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly the committee rose; and  the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. BRADEMAS)  having assumed the chair, Mr. McFALL,  Chairman of the Committee of the Whole  House on the State of  the Union, re ported that that committee, having had  under consideration the bill (H.R. 8309)  I  authorizing certain public works on riv ers for navigation, and for other pur poses, had come to no resolution there on.  GENERAL LEAVE  ",1977
325,House,95,-0.334,356,26,Mr. EDGAR.," Mr. Speaker, the transit  supply industry in the United States is  in a serious crisis. The chart printed be low shows  that, over  the past 2 years,  the Urban Mass Transportation Admin istration has approved grant requests for  only seven rail car purchase orders: An  inappropriately small numbe: given the  tremendous need for new  transit cars  in Boston, New York, Chicago, and Phil adelphia.  Clearly, our transit systems have too  many needs chasing too few Federal dol lars. More money must be authorized  for rail car replacement and other sys tem modernization activities.  This problem-a market problem-is  compounded by the relative uncompeti tiveness of domestic suppJ.iers in securing  contracts for new rail cars. Of the seven  orders placed during  the last 2 years,  only two have gone to American manu facturers. Part of the problem rests in  the unfair ""terms and conditions"" that  the Federal Government imposes on rail  car procurements. These terms and con ditions have given  transit operators a  virtual free hand  in designing hybrid  vehicles  for each need  that surfaces;  within the framework of fixed-price con tracts, manufacturers have been held ac countable to the performance demands  of these highly complicated hybrid spe cifications and in this environment it is  almost impossible to turn a profit. For eign manufacturers subsidized by their  respective governments are better able  to swallow these losses than are Ameri can companies working in our free mar ket economy.  I have introduced legislation designed  to counter these disturbing trends in the  domestic transit industry. H.R. 9036, the  Public Transportation Stimulus Act of  1977, puts more money behind rail car  replacement, bus acquisition, and mod ernization of existing  transit systems.  The Urban Mass Transportation Admin istration would be required, over a 4year period, to make available approxi mately $1.3 billion for rail car replace ment grants.  In accompanying  report  language, the agency will be instructed  to develop a predictable rail car replace ment schedule for each of the Nation's  eight rail transit cities.  When the House Surface Transporta tion Subcommittee concludes  its hear ings into Federal surface transportation  policy later this year, and gets down to  the task of assembling a new bill and its  accompanying report, I also  intend  to  direct  the subcommittee's attention  to  the  ""terms  and  conditions""  problem.  This is a problem the administration can  solve alone, but without congressional  prodding  I  believe  it will continue  to  postpone the issuance of a new set of  standard terms and conditions.  My new bill does not mandate that all  Federal rail car orders be placed with  American manufacturers. This kind of  outright, unbending protectionism would  close  the potentially-lucrative  foreign  rail car market to our companies. Some  sanctions must be imposed on products  from nations that have sanctions against  our products, and something must be  done  to  disallow  foreign  government  subsidy of the bids submitted by foreign  manufacturers.  I  am not sure at this  stage that new legislation is needed to  impose these kinds of selective penalties;  I intend to explore the matter with our  trade negotiator, Bob Strauss,  in  the  near future.  What I propose now is a  limited but  effective course of  action. With more  money behind the Federal transit pro gram, and new Federal guidelines  for  rail car procurements,  I  believe  that  more contracts will go to American sup pliers and more  jobs would be created  here at home.

And, cer tainly, at this point I want to congratu late the chairman as well, on his sincere  efforts.  All too often we hear from extremes in  debate like  this. I stand here today as  someone who is torn in two on this ques tion of abortion. I have very strong feel ings against abortion and yet I  recog nize there are times when there are com pelling  needs  for  abortion.  I  regret  that I must oppose the language that is  before us, because I feel it is so important  that victims of rape and incest be given  proper treatment.  I was a local government official for 12  years before coming here. I can tell you  that young women do not report rape  and do not report incest to law enforce ment agencies. We are trying to change  that. We are trying to change that by  getting more sensitive treatment for vic tims from law enforcement agencies, but  we have a long way to go before women  will feel comfortable about going in, to  report rape-especially very, very young  women.  And surely we know that victims of in cest most decidedly would be afraid to go  to  law enforcement officials  to  report  their problems. So it is not until they  learn  they are pregnant that we hear  from these young women. U say young  women, although I could really say ""chil dren"" because many of them are mere  children.)

349,,95,-0.264,668,26,Mr. HEFNER.," Mr. Speaker, it is with  great sadness in my heart that I rise to  address my colleagues on  this solemn  occasion. For our Nation,  the State of  North Carolina, and  the city of Kan napolis have lost a great leader and a  man of great wisdom and courage. He  was a  true servant of God, both proud  and modest, who  in his brief  lifetime  came a  long way and accomplished a  great deal. He was Dr. Charles Calvin  Coffey.  The people of my district, specifically  those  in-Kannapolis,  knew him,  and  loved him, and will remember him with  great warmth and admiration. Through  his Christian leadership he demonstrated  a dedication and devotion to Christ as he  brought  intense  love  and  care  to all  human beings;  the poor,  the sick,  the  underprivileged, and to his church. Dr.  Coffey served as pastor of the First Bap tist Church of Kannapolis for 24 years.  He was born in Caroline, Va., January  12, 1922, of the late Mr. and Mrs. L. W.  Coffey of Fredericksburg, Va. He was  graduated from High Point College, High  Point, N.C., with a bachelor of arts de gree and graduated with a bachelor of  divinity  from  the  Southern Baptist  Theological Seminary.  He undertook further studies at the  Duke University Divinity School and the  Princeton Theological Seminary. He held  the master of divinity degree and  the  doctor of laws.  Mr. Speaker, time does not permit a  litany of Dr. Charles Coffey in behalf of  his community, his neighbors, and hu manity at large. He spent most of his  adult life in service to God and his fellow  man, which needs no  explanation on  demands of personal  time and energy.  But in addition to this, Mr. Speaker, he  left the following record of contribution:  Denominational experiences:  Vice-Moderator, Valley Association of Vir ginia, 1950-51.

Livermore, Calif. As a mem ber of Livermore's Fire Service, Char lie  has  consistently  and  successfully  sought to reduce the loss of life that all  too  frequently  results  from  fire  and  panic. His down-to-earth common sense  has, in fact, prevented many a tragedy.  October 12, 1977  This weekend Charlie will be honored  with a  testimonial dinner on the occa sion of his retirement. Charlie's ""old fashioned"" notions of tradition, loyalty,  and dedication, enhanced by his per sonal honesty and fairness have been an  enormous contribution  to  the commu nity he has served so faithfully. Char lie's contribution to his community will  not be forgotten on this occasion, or in  the days to come.  THE LABOR BILL  HON. ROBERT H. MICHEL  OF  ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 12, 1977  ",1977
351,,95,0.372,694,26,Mr. MICHEL.," Mr. Speaker, when busi ness and  labor get  into an argument  over labor law reforms, there is often an  innocent bystander who gets hurt-the  American worker. Big business speaks up  for business. Big labor speaks up for big  labor. But when the battle is joined, it is  often  the worker,  for whom no  one  speaks, who is hurt.  This forgotten American, the working  man, is the subject of an incisive and in formative editorial  in  the Washington  Post. As  the Post points out, although  much was said by business and labor  during the recent debate over proposed  changes in the labor law, ""No one seems  to talk in the workers behalf."" When the  most  liberal newspaper  in  the United  States makes that point in an editorial,  I believe it can safely be said that there  is wide agreement that it is in the pub lic interest-and in the interest of every  American worker-for Congress to make  certain that any labor reform bill takes  into consideration the  interests of  the  worker as well as that of business and  big labor.  I could not in all conscience support  the version of this bill that passed the  House because it was obvious that it was  tilted  too much  toward  the perceived  needs of big labor unions, not enough  toward the legitimate needs of business  and not at all toward the worker. I hope  the Senate comes up with a fair bill that  meets  the needs of all concerned-in cluding the public.  At this ooint I wish to insert into the  RECORD, ""The Labor Bill"" from the Wash ington Post, October 12, 1977:  THE LABOR BILL  The tinkering that was done to the labor  b111 on the floor of the House of Represent atives improved it some, but not much. The  friends of organized  labor had  the votes  llned up, and from among the amendments  offered  they accepted only those that were  quite palatable, never mind that their per formance gave the impression that they were  prepared to water down the bill. The result  is that the Senate faces the major task of try ing to turn this one-sided piece of legisla tion  into  the basic reform  the  labor  laws  need.  It is not to endorse everything that is in  the House-approved bill to observe that our  quarrel is primarily with what the bill falls  to do, as distinct from what it does. It is  true,  as organized  labor has  successfully  argued  to a majority of House members,  that some employers have abused the exist ing law and used its loopholes to frustrate  ",1977
352,Senate,95,0.172,759,26,Mr. YOUNG.," I do not think there is  any objection to the bill itself, but just  the procedure. The rules that it should  go to the Appropriations Committee for  their consideration. Many feel we can  pass a bill this afternoon. I hope we can.  ",1977

354,House,95,-0.196,772,26,Mr. VOLKMER.," To qualify for 90-per cent funding the fraud unit can be trans ferred, as I read the law and understand  it, to another department outside of the  Department of Social Services. Not  to  the Attorney General's office, because  that will not occur in Missouri.  I believe I know Missouri government  and  I  believe  the people  in Missouri  know Missouri government better than  the Members of Congress from the other  States do.  That unit may be transferred to an other ~.epartment outside  the Depart ment of Social Services in order to qual ify for a 90-percent funding.  One of those two things will occur. The  question is: Will that improve the opera tion of the fraud unit for medicaid? I  guarantee you that it will not for  the  simple reason that this fraud unit is one  that is doing a good job right now and  I do not believe that you are going to  improve it one bit. You will just cause  trouble for the State government.  ",1977
355,House,95,0.103,785,26,Mr. RAILSBACK.," Mr. Chairman  I  rise in support of the Krueger ame~d­ ment to delete section 7 of H.R. 3816  the  Federal Trade Commission Amendm'ents  of 1977. This section of  the bill would  create a new secti'On 20  to the Federal  Trade Commission Act  containing  a  number of provisions which apply if the  private suit is  to be brought in behalf  of a class. In essence, this would provide  that notice to class members need only  be given by publication in newspapers,  radio,  television or other medium, by  posting at locations where class mem ?er~ ~re likely to see  the notice, or by  md1v1dual notice to each member of the  class who  can  be  identified  through  reasonable efforts. In addition, individ ual notice may be provided to a sample  or subgroup of the class. The amount of  damages would be aggregated by statisti cal sampling and estimates.  I  believe  that the constitutional guarantee of due  process  requires more  than  this. The  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure-rule  23 contains provisions for notice in class  action cases and the Supreme Court has  interpreted that as requiring individual  notice  to  class members.  In Eisen v.  the  Supreme Court  rejected  sample  and  media forms of notice  that could not  guarantee notice to the individual mem bers of the class. No doubt a sample or  media method would  be more  conJacquelin, 417 U.S. 156,  Carlisle &  venient and less expensive, but improved  efficiency is no justification for the con travention of constitutional rights. Stop  to consider the possible  impact of sec tion 7 : Those not receiving notice would  be barred from litigating their claims and  .if they spoke up too late, the funds avail able for recovery might already be ex hausted.  Those  latecomers  are  con sumers, too, and their interests deserve  protection. On the other hand, the de fending  firm would not have  the op portunity  to confront all of the plain tiffs, yet it would still have to provide  damages sufficient to compensate each.  No matter how well-intended, section 7  clearly should be deleted.  ",1977
356,House,95,-0.27,785,26,Mr. PREYER.," Mr. Chairman, the vari ous amendments that have been offered  to section 7 of the bill do  improve this  section and address some of the prob~  lems concerning our judicial system in  the  section. Chairman  EcKHARDT  de serves credit for his efforts to compro mise the differences over this section.  But  I  conclude  that  the  problems  created by section 7 are much too com plex to be solved by amendments written  on the House floor. We should wait for  the results of the studies being under taken by  the Justice Department and  the Judicial Council. We should get the  views of the Judiciary Committee.  Let me list briefly these issues affect ing our judicial system.  The  first  is  the potential  for court  congestion. Class actions, especially of  the type envisioned by section 7, require  a good deal of judicial time. The impact  of such actions on already overburdened  judiciary should be carefully analyzed.  Second,  section  7 would  establish  special  class  action procedures appli able  to  these private  rights of action  under the FTC Act. In effect, it would  mandate a revision of part of rule 23 of  the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The wisdom of piecemeal revisions of the  Federal Rules is questionable, especially  since  the administration has  indicated  that it will be examining the entire ques tion of class actions in some depth. In  my opinion, it makes no sense to legis late piecemeal changes to rule 23 in these  circumstances. It would be much prefer able to wait until we have the products  of the administration's efforts.  Another  troublesome  aspect of  the  special procedures that would be estab lished by section 7 is  its notice provi sions. These  requirements would  relax  the . requirements  imposed by  the Su preme Court for notifying members of  the affected class. This raises questions  as to the constitutionality of these notice  provisions and as to their basic fairness.  Another area of concern  is  the role  that State courts would play under sec tion 7. Enforcement of  the FTC Act  has been the exclusive responsibility of  the FTC and Federal courts; we ought  to be aware of the likely effects diffus ing  this responsibility before acting. A  further area which needs examination  concerns the wisdom of  imposing com plex procedural  requirements, such us  those set forth  in section 7, on State  courts.  A related  issue  that should be cov ered by  the  study  is  the concept of  ",1977
357,,95,0.343,902,26,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker, this  week is National Fire Prevention Week  as designated by Congress. Many desig nations of special days or weeks are  merely honorary. However,  the observ ance of National Fire Prevention Week  is a most serious matter. Last year over  700,000 families were struck by flaming  disasters. Lives are lost and untold mil lions of dollars are wasted each year  due to fire.  Fire Prevention Week dramatizes the  need for more effective communication  with our citizens to help them save lives  and property-lives and property  that  are sometimes lost due to a  failure  to  adequately prepare for and prevent fires.  Mr. Speaker, for the past 2 weeks my  staff and I have had the privilege of  having a fireman from my home district  in Seattle serve as a  special projects  intern in our office. Mr. Robert H. Clark,  a 19-year veteran of the Seattle force is  a fine example of all our Nation's fireEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  fighters. Men dedicated  to saving  the  lives of our citizens. Men with particular  traits designed to cope with waiting for  and coping with disaster.  Bob Clark performed a great service  for me. As Members of this body know,  we are faced with a wide variety of issues  in our day-to-day work. Sometimes we  may not have the time to fully explore  those issues and problems facing various  segments of our society. Bob shared his  expertise with my staff and myself and  I can say  that now we are aware of  certain problems  facing  those  in  the  firefighting profession. These problems  range  from  training programs,  arson  prevention, pension plans, and a myriad  of others.  The experience of having Mr. Clark  in our office was both illuminating and  enjoyable. I urge my colleagues to con sider implementing an intern program  such as this and to get to know the men  who fight fires. They may be our best  friends.  I congratulate Bob Clark and every  single fireman in this Nation for  their  hard work and devotion to duty.  FLUIDIZED BED COMBUSTION  HON. TIM LEE CARTER  OF KENTUCKY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 13, 1977  ",1977
358,,95,0.08,902,26,Mr. CARTER.," Mr. Speaker, over the  past few weeks I have been inserting in  the RECORD  information concerning a  new process for burning coal known as  fluidized-bed combustion <FBC)  system.  The two previous inserts can be found in  the Extensions of Remarks on Septem ber 20 and on September 23.  To briefly review the information in  those  articles,  FBC  uses  sized  and  crushed  coal and  limestone  that are  mixed in a heated chamber in such a  manner that  the mixture of coal and  limestone is aerated to produce a mass  of particles  that behave  like a  fluid.  The coal and  limestone  fluid  is  then  burned. Water flows  through coils that  are submerged in the combustion cham ber and is heated into steam.  The FBC process promises low sulfur  dioxide  and nitrogen oxide  emissions  coupled with high overall efficiency  in  generating heat and power. In addition,  FBC boasts  the capability of burning  many types and grades of coal, including  eastern coal, as well as municipal sludge  and refuse,  industrial and agricultural  cellulosic waste material, oil shale, and  petroleum  fractions. Also, FBC offers  low capital and operating costs as com pared with conventional coal-fired boiler  systems.  With  these articles on FBC,  I have  been trying to bring to the attention of  every Member that there is a need for  more  research  and development  into  cleaner and more efficient methods of  burning coal.  Coal  is a vital part of  this Nation's  energy ,future. In the development of the  national energy plan, we  have  found  that the well-being of the United States  October 13, 1977  will depend heavily upon a continuous  and secure supply of  fossil  fuels and  especially, on a greater use of America's  coal.  Why is America's coal so important?  The General Accounting Office in a re port entitled ""U.S. Coal Development Promises, Uncertainties,"" states thatIt  (coal)  represents 90  percent of  the  Nation's total  fossil  fuel  reserves. Yet,  it  currently supplies only 18 percent of energy  needs. Coal's  importance  grows,  hawever,  when you consider that domestic oil a.nd  gas  supplies  a.re  limited,  a.nd  declining  rapidly ... and  that  the dependence on  (uncertain) foreign energy sources continues  to increase.  It is well established that coal con stitutes a  secure and abundant alter native energy source. Increased use of  coal would greatly reduce the amounts  of oil and gas used by the utility and  industrial sector. It would  thus make  domestic supplies of  these fuels avail able for the unique requirements of the  residential, commercial, and transporta tion sectors of the economy.  It is expected that coal will provide for  at least one-half of our domestic energy  needs by the year 1984. Such an increased  use of coal would help in balancing our  foreign trade deficit and lessen the U.S.  dependence on foreign energy supplies.  Most important, the increased use of  coal for heat and power would benefit  not only the coal mining regions of the  United States but would ease the supply  problems  facing  the  energy-starved  Northeast, the cold Midwest, and,  to a  great extent, all other areas of this great  country of ours.  Mr.  Speaker,  fluidized-bed  combus tion is one technology being developed to  provide more clean and economically  efficient ways  to use our vast coal re sources to meet national energy needs.  The objective of  the Federal Govern ment's coal program is to develop, on an  accelerated  and  cost-effective  basis,  technology that will permit rapid com mercialization of processes that are tech nically and economically  sound, envi ronmentally acceptable, and which rep resent efficient use of natural resources.  The FBC system has been given optimis tic reviews by both the Energy Research  and Development Administration  and  the Tennessee Valley Authority with re spect  to  these objectives. ERDA and  TVA have pilot projects underway which  have every indication of success.  I am pleased to insert into the RECORD  today a summary of a  report entitled  ''Application of Fluidized-Bed Technol ogy  to Industrial Boilers."" This report  summarizes a new area  in which  the  FBC technology is being applied success fully:  industrial boilers. The manufac turing industries that consume most of  the industrial boiler fuel in the United  States include chemicals, petroleum re fining, paper, primary metals, food, and  many other industries. The application  of the FBC process to industrial boilers  is one design, a step away from being  put  into  commercial use. ERDA has  funded several projects on FB'C. Among  these are  the Georgetown University I  Fluidized-Bed Combustion Corp. and the  Exxon Research and Engineering Co.  ",1977
359,,95,0.49,915,26,Mr. DORNAN.," Mr. Speaker, in all of  the  praise  over  the  liberation  and  democratization in which many in this  country have seen fit to revel since the  fall of Saigon  in April 1975, one fact  is quite clear. During the last 2 years,  internal events in the countries of Indo china, especially Cambodia, have shown  that  these so-called ""liberation move ments,"" which the Peter Bournes, Sam  Browns, and Tom Haydens of this coun try so enthusiastically defended, have  unleased  a  repressive  reign of  terror  which history will surelv rank alongside  those as fiendish and dehumanizing as  Stalin's purges and Hitler's concentra tion camps.  A  recently published article  in  the  Washington Post and an editorial in the  New York Times cogently commented on  this point and I insert it in the RECORD  at this point.  ""LIBERATION"" COMES TO VIETNAM  In the swell of opposition to the war in  Vietnam during the decade before America's  withdrawal,  there was  always  a minority,  small but vehement, that looked to the Com munists as saviors of that unhappy  land.  They carried Vietcong flags in peace demon strations, hailed Ho Chi Minh as the George  Washington of his country, and  invariably  spoke of the North Vietnamese as liberators.  One organ of this celebration was The New  York Review of Books, and so it comes as a  surprise--a welcome one-to find reprinted  in a recent issue an article from the French  journal  L'Express  by  Andre  Gelinas,  a  French-Canadian Catholic priest and Chi nese scholar who settled in Vietnam in 1948,  and was expelled  in July 1976, 15 months  after the North Vietnamese troops arrived in  Saigon.  The picture that Father Gelinas paints of  South Vietnam since its ""liberation"" is one  of widespread misery, constant surveillance,  incessant propaganda,  endless  indoctrina tions, arbitrary arrests, executions, imprisonments, and exile to remote areas. He describes  a  society where an arrogant bureaucracy  reaches into every corner of life, where books  are burned, citizens are denounced, and in formers thrive.  Father Gelinas observes that ""the methods,  the doctrine and very weight of the police  and bureaucratic apparatus""  in the South  now  ""are  entirely Russian."" That  seems  right. At least, it is in accord with Hannah  Arendt's observation, based  largely on  the  experience of Stalinism, that ""terror is the  essence of totalitarian domination."" In the  list of countries that are today suffocating  the rights of their citizens, Vietnam must  rank high.  To be sure, this finding, however repug nant, does not make a case in favor of the  American intervention in Vietnam. The men  we supported were scarcely true-blue demo crats. Nor should it impede the ongoing ef forts by the Administration to establish re lations with Hanoi. There are good reasons  for  coming  to diplomatic  terms with  re gimes that do not share American values, and  the United States owes a special debt to the  Vietnamese people. But for  those who op posed the war, Father Gelinas's report con tains bitter and inescapable ironies.  T:C.e British magazine Spectator has drawn  an  interesting  parallel  between  our war  against  the Vietcong and  the British war  against the Boers: ""The pro-Boers and the  pro-Vietcop.g were wrong about the ""enemy'  but right about  the war. The Boers were  idealized as gallant underdog nationalists,  which, like the NLF [the National Liberation  Front], they were, but which view overlooked  the fact that they were fighting as well to  keep their hands on the wealth of the Rand  and to continue oppressing the blacks, as the  NLF was fighting to institute a mindless to tali tarian dictatorship.""  The Vietnam experience was always more  complex than ideologues of either side could  allow. America may have played a villain's  role  there, but the heroes of that tragedy  were never easy to discern.  [From the Washington Post, Aug. 1, 1977)  SOUTH VIETNAM TODAY: A HARSH LIFE  (By Lewis M. Simons)  BANGKOK, THAILAND.-One year after the  unification of the two Vietnams, life in the  southern part of the country and its former  capital, Saigon, seems not so much oppres sive as harsh.  The Hanoi government has put pressure  on the southerners to make  them conform  to Communist ways, but this pressure has  been applied gradually and according to a  well-defined plan.  Gathering details of how this plan is tak ing effect is somewhat easier than learning  about xenophobic Cambodia and, to a certain  extent, Loos. An extensive foreign diplomatic  corps lives in Hanoi and there are some con sulates in Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh  City.  The main sources of  information about  life in the south, however, are letters from  residents to relatives living abroad, the gov ernment's own news media and the continu ing fiow of refugees.  These bits and pieces of information mak ing their way to Bangkok, a major Vietnam watching outpost, make  it clear  that  life  is  tough, but unlike Cambodia, that there  apparently have been few executions of anti Communists.  Instead, the regime has arrested, isolated  or, as Prime Minister Pham Van Dong put it  recently, ""rehabilitated"" active supporters of  the U.S.-backed Nguyen Van Thieu govern ment. This is a euphemism for psychological  or physical punishment.  Groups singled out for particularly harsh  treatment are former senior military officers,  activist clergy, and private businessmen.

361,House,95,0.135,928,26,Mr. STANTON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  to urge my col leagues to support the conference report  before us.  This is in fact quite a noncontrover sial conference report. In the bill, which  you will  remember we passed handily  under suspension of the rules, the Con gress  takes  care  of minor  technical  problems  in  the U.S.  Export-Import  Banks authorization legislation.  The main purpose of H.R. 6415  is to  extend the Export-Import Bank Act of  1945, as amended, from June 30, 1978, to  September 30, 1978,  in order  to bring  the Bank's statutory operating author ity into line with the fiscal year. When  the Export-Import Bank Act was last  extended, the fiscal year ended on June  30;  since the fiscal year has now been  changed  to end on September 30,  the  expiration date of  the Export-Import  Bank Act required changing as well. The  House and the other body were in agree ment on the need for this 3-month ex tension of the Bank's authority.  The difference between the House and  the other version arose from the inclu sion by the House in this extension bill  of substantive amendments concerning  human  rights,  international  export  financing competition, and antinuclear  proliferation policy.

363,,95,-0.1,980,26,Mr. STEERS.," Mr. Speaker, on Thurs day October 6, 1977, the House passed  by~ vote of 257 to 163, the bill H.R. 8410,  Labor Law Reform Act. I voted for this  bill, because after the House completed  action on the bill, I felt that most of the  legitimate concerns of the business com munity had been answered.  I would be less than frank if I  told  you that I supported this bill from the  outset.  I had  several major concerns  that had to be resolved before I would  vote for H.R. 8410. The bill as reported  by the House Education and Labor Com mittee had inserted the provision that  no more than a simple majority of the  board members may be a member of the  same political party. I  felt that it was  possible  that  the  administration  in  power,  this one or one  in  the future,  could  stock  the board and  eliminate  careful  nonpartisan  work  that  has  marked the efforts of the National La bor Relations Board. The committee's  action prevented any such occurrence.  There were also provisions in the bill  to allow for  three  two-member panels  to sit and decide on noncontroversial  standard labor law decisions. I felt that  the two-member panels were inadequate  to protect the interests of both parties.  I supported an amendment that would  increase the panels  to  three members.  This amendment was adopted.  The bill as approved by the commit tee called for elections to be held within  15 days if the labor organizers had ob tained signatures on authorization cards  of a majority of the workers. In my dis cussions with business  leaders  it was  clear  that  they  felt  that the 15 days  would not be sufficient time for them to  present their case to the workers. This  time limit was increased from 15  to 25  days, and longer for the more compli cated cases. This amendment was ap proved. also.  Finally there were two other provisions  that were amended by the House. The  first extended  the equal access provi sions of the bill  to allow employers  to  visit union halls and other prounion  gatherings. The second provision eased  the debarment  remedy by giving  the  Secretary of Labor greater flexibility in  applying that section of the bill against  noncooperative employers.  Let me stress that I believe this bill  strikes the proper balance between the  rights of unions  to organize and  the  rights of  employers  to operate  their  businesses.  I do not believe  that H.R.  8410 will  lead  to ""rampant unionism""  that could destroy our economy.  I do  believe the bill is fair and is aimed to  deal  effectively with  employers who  have  flouted  the  law and have never  paid  the penalty. This  is  the sort of  positive legislation that will, I hope, take  much of  the conflict and antagonism  out of labor-management relations.  CANONIZATION OF FATHER  CHARBEL MAKHLOUF  HON.

Dr. Bradford, a minister  and musical director of  the Greater  Abyssinian Baptist Church  in Newark,  has served our community very well by  encouraging civic  involvement  through  music and church activities. He is truly  a community  leader who has willingly  shared his great professional skills with  others, and I am pleased to insert the  following article into the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD in recognition of Dr. Bradford.  [From the Newark Star-Ledger, Oct. 17, 1977]  NEWARK MINISTER STARS AT WHITE HOUSE  PARTY  WASHINGTON.-Dr. Alex Bradford of New ark wa.s a special ""guest of honor"" at a White  Hcuse party last week at which President  Carter, his :family and some 500 guests were  enthralled by  the music he composed  for  HON.

I urge my colleagues to  support the conference report language  to section 107 of this legislation.  When  this section of H.R. 7797 was  originally considered by the House, two  amendments were agreed upon. The first,  which I offered, prohibited any of these  appropriations from being used to finance  reparations to the Socialist Republic of  Vietnam. At that time I stated to my col leagues that the word ""reparations"" im plies a debt due and therefore must be  distinguished from the word ""assistance""  which  implies voluntary action. While  I have no doubt that the United States  is under no obligation, legal or moral, to  provide such reparations, the purpose of  this amendment was to put to rest the  question  that was raised by  the letter  which President Nixon sent to the Viet",1977
372,House,95,0.189,1240,26,Mr. SKUBITZ.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition to S. 393. This is exactly the  same bill which failed to muster a two thirds vote under suspension of the rules  on September 27. Because it is again be ing brought up under suspension of the  rules, the reasons for opposing it remain  unchanged.  As written, S. 393 provides a 7-year  period for studies and Presidential rec ommendations  to Congress  regarding  wilderness classification of nine national  forest areas in Montana totaling 973,000  acres. The bill further provides that these  study areas shall be managed as wilder ness until Congress determines other wise.  The bill sets no limit on the amount of  time Congress has to act on the recom mendations, which means that the study  areas could remain in de facto wilderness  status indefinitely. Consequently, the fu ture of whole  economies of adjacent  communities which depend on multiple  use of the timber and other resources in  the national forests would be uncertain  for years until Congress got around to  acting on whatever  recommendations  would be submitted by the President.  In Montana  this  legislation  is not  without controversy, which is one reason  why it should not be considered without  possible amendments.  As I understand it, the Montana con gressional delegation  is evenly divided  over this bill with Senator METCALF and  Congressman BAucus favoring it in its  present form and Senator MELCHER and  Congressman MARLENEE  favoring  an  amended bill. Their differences are not  merely partisan in nature. Rather, they  concern whether some areas should be  included  in wilderness  study  at  all,  whether  certain  boundary  changes  shoUld be made, and whether the study  period should be shortened and Congress  required to take action on the wilderness  recommendations  by  a  date  certain.  These questions arise out of valid differ ences of opinion and reflect what we have  been  told  is considerable local opposi tion as well as support for the proposed  study areas. For this reason, I think the  House has an obligation to consider S.  393 with amendments.  During subcommittee and full commit tee consideration of S. 393,  the gentle man  from Montana  (Mr. MARLENEE)  whose district includes two of the nine  proposed  study  areas,  offered  several  amendments which were narrowly de feated. The committee rejected all at tempts  to  amend  the  bill,  including  boundary adjustments suggested by the  Forest Service  to reduce  resource use  conflicts in several of the study areas.  When you consider that 9 of the 14 votes  recorded in subcommittee were cast by  proxy and that at full committee markup  no more  than  16 members  of  the  43-member committee were present at  any one time, perhaps you will agree that  the gentleman from Montana is entitled  to further consideration from  the full  House.  To bring this bill up under suspension  a second time and thus continue to deny  him the right to appeal to the collective  judgment of the House the committ~e's  close decisions on matters of great sig nificance to his district is simply unfair  and an abrogation of our responsibili ties as legislators. I would point out that  in Mr. MARLENEE's case, we are talking  of his interest in two areas totaling 172,000 acres, or 269 square miles.  My understanding of  the  legislative  process is that it is supposed to encourage  full airing of issues to allow competing  interests  to be heard and  to facilitate  compromise. Given the sharp differences  of opinion over the implications of the  proposed wilderness study area inS. 393,  it clearly merits further consideration by  this House.  I see no reason to rush this bill through  this session. Certainly, Montana is in no  danger without it for  the  time being.  Congress already has designated some  1,796,000  acres of wilderness  in  that  State. Proposed wilderness areas cover  some 605,000 acres, and an additional  1,738,475 acres is currently under study  for wilderness. The combined areas com prise almost 25 percent of the national  forest system lands in the State of Mon tana.  Mr. Speaker, I believe it is imperative  that this bill be voted down so it can be  reconsidered at a later date under a rule  permitting amendments. This  is  only  appropriate for such a controversial piece  of legislation. I  therefore strongly urge  that the Members join today in voting  downS. 393.  ",1977

374,House,95,-0.631,1253,26,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker, I am rising  in strong support of H.R. 7769. Of special  interest to me is the Senate's amendment  to  this bill extending  the Indochinese  refugee assistance program, known as  IRAP. I have introduced several pieces  of legislation over the past 6 months to  extend !RAP. These gained over 50 co sponsors in the House. I was gratified  that many of my provisions were  in cluded in the Senate's bill.  This extension is absolutely necessary.  Although over 86 percent of the nearly  150,000  refugees  in  the United States  employed  last year, nearly 35 percent  were receiving some sort of cash assist ance under the program to supplement  their very low wages. Without the con tinuation of Federal assistance, State  and  local  taxpayers  in many commu nities across  the Nation will be  faced  with increased  local  taxes  to meet the  cost of assisting  these refugees.  In California, where approximately 46  percent of Indochinese refugees were re ceiving  cash  assistance,  these  extra  costs will amount to more than $34 mil lion. Unless this bill is passed, about $12  million of this amount would have to be  raised by increasing local property taxes.  Action  is especially urgent since  the  program expired on September 30. HEW  is currently continuing the program on  a limited basis with unspent funds. These  funds, however, will be completely ex hausted by the end of the month. Not  only would termination of IRAP at this  time work undue hardship on more than  30 States and the refugees living therein,  but it would also effectively deny assist ance  to  the 15,000 additional  refugees  whose admission the Attorney General  authorized on August 11. The Federal  Government cannot deny assistance to  these refugees who will be arriving over  the coming year.  The Senate amendment to H.R. 7769  satisfies the need for a continuing Fed eral program refugee assistance, while  avoiding the danger of institutionalizing  dependency among the refugees. It pro vides for an orderly phase-down of !RAP  and  the  transfer of  the  refugees  into  ongoing Federal and/ or State programs  over a 4-year period. Reimbursement to  State and local governments would con tinue at 100 percent for the first year  and  then successively drop 25 percent  over the next 3 years. The program would  end in fiscal year 1981.  In addition, the amendment authorizes  $25 million for special projects. These  projects, run largely by voluntary agen cies, have  transmitted  the  skills  and  training necessary for  the  refugees  to  become self-sufficient. They have proven  very effective in helping to take refugees  off of cash assistance and are responsible  for  the  remarkably high  employment  rate among the refugees.  This legislation is strongly supported  by  the administration. :t also has  the  full support of  the voluntary agencies  and local communities  involved  in the  resettlement effort. Of special importance  in this regard, is the support of an ad  hoc coalition of State governments and  voluntary agencies called the C;oalition  for  the Effective Resettlement of  the  Indo-Chinese Refugees.  I  have  been  working with Mr. Stan Breen, Special  Assistant to the Governor of Minnesota,  who has ably led this group, for over 6  months.  I would also like to thank the chair man of Judiciary's Subcommittee on Im migration,  Citizenship,  and  Interna tional Law, Mr. EILBERG, and the ranking  minority member, Mr. FisH,  for  their  recognition of the need for this legisla tion  and  their  support.  It has been  essential.  An  extension  of  the  Indochinese  refugee assistance program will allow us  to complete the process of resettlement  we began in the spring of 1975. It is  responsible, cost-effective, and humane.  I urge you to join me and vote ""yes"" on  H.R. 7769.  ",1977
375,House,95,0.109,1253,26,Mr. PRITCHARD.," Mr. Speaker, today  we consider Senate amendments to H.R.  7769, a bill calling for the adjustment of  status of Indochinese refugees and, as  amended by Senator KENNEDY, providing  for a 4-year extension of Federal funding  of a refugee assistance program. This bill  is of crucial importance to 150,000 refu gees and of special significance  to all  Americans.  September 30, 1977 marked  the  ter mination of  the  Indochinese  resettle ment program. That program represent ed an essential and successful first step  in our efforts to help resettle the largest  influx of refugees at any  time  in  this  Nation's history. While that program ex tended our country as a haven from per secution,  this bill extends our country  as a permanent home for the refugees.  This bill represents both the next logical  step and the final step we must take in  assimilating our newest refugee group.  If I may comment briefly on the refu gees  response to  the resettlement pro gram to date, it is especially noteworthy.  During the first 2 years of resettlement,  these people quickly displayed their will ingness to become productive members of  our society. Of those possessing an un derstanding of English and a competence  in such professions as journalism, teach ing, and business, many have accepted  employment in such unrelated  jobs as  painters, carpenters, and security guards.  Their efforts over this short period indi cates a desire not to burden our society,  but to contribute to it. But their quest  for a productive self sufficiency depends  on our actions  today, as many of  the  paths to  their goal are closed to them  because of their status.  For example, most States  limit em ployment in certain professions to U.S.  citizens or permanent  resident  aliens  who have declared their intention to be come U.S. citizens. Enactment of  this  bill would authorize these refugees to ad just their status from parolees to per manent resident aliens and thus open a  wide range of employment opportunities.  Also,  their present parole status effec tively closes the door to higher educa tion as most States require refugees with  such an uncertain status to pay substan tially higher out of State tuition to at tend their community colleges and uni versities. These are but two of the many  important consequences of passage of  this bill.  Enactment of this bill as amended will  also provide $25 million for special proj ects. These special projects to assist ref ugees in gaining skills and education nec essary to become self-reliant have proven  effective in removing refugees from the  welfare rolls and thus warrant our con tinued support.  A 4-year phaseout of  the program  built into this bill clearly indicates that  this is the final step toward completion  of our refugee resettlement efforts.  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues  to join me in support of this bill. With  your support, we may today write an epi log of hope  to a  long and despairing  chapter in our Nation's history.

377,,95,0.188,1292,26,Mr. HARSHA.," Mr. Speaker, I wish to  express my deep distress over the pre cipitate action of  the House Ways and  Means Committee in reporting a measure  which  is designed  to  rescue  the social  security system at the expense of our  teachers and other Federal, State, and  local government employees.  I have long been concerned over the  fiscal  soundness of  the social security  system and strongly support appropriate  action to place it on a financially sound  and viable basis. However, to sacrifice our  Federal, State, municipal, and teachers  retirement programs  toward  this goal  does not make sense and represents a  betrayal of government employees at all  levels.  As  reported, H.R.  9346,  the Social  Security Financing Amendments of 1977,  provides for mandatory coverage of Fed eral, State, and  local government em ployees, effective  in 1982. This action  would bring about 2.6 million Federal  and approximately 4 million State and  local government employees and teachers  under mandatory social security cover age. While this expanded coverage would  bring about a massive  influx  in social  security taxes, the end result might well  be  the end of government  retirement  systems as they now exist.  To integrate such different retirement  programs would, at best, pose a most dif ficult problem. This is evidenced by the  fact that H.R. 9346 also provides for a  study to be undertaken by the Depart ment of Health, Education, and Welfare  and  the Civil Service Commission of  methods of integrating the social security  and civil  service  retirement programs  and other Government retirement pro grams and requires the Secretary to pre sent to the Congress a specitic and de tailed plan for the integration of these  systems by January 1, 1980.  It may well be  that this study will  prove  that  these  systems  cannot  be  equitably and effectively merged. In my  judgment, it would be foolhardy to m~n­ date  that these systems are  to be m tegrated before the study is undertaken.  If the supporters of H.R. 9346 feel this  proposal merits.such a study, then by all  means let us wait until the results are  available for evaluation before determin ing whether or not the  integration of  these systems is feasible. But let us not  commit ourselves blindly to a course of  action before the details are resolved.  ",1977

I know that many others are making  valuable contributions to the Neighbor hood Care Team, but  the outstanding  leader of this program is Dee Magnani,  of New Brunswick,  its coordinator and  supervisor. Dee is remarkable in so many  ways, for she is not only very able, but  very compassionate. Her interest in the  problems and hopes of the elderly is deep  and strong and rare. She is one of my  most talented and versatile constituents.  I am exetrmely proud of Dee Magnani.  Recently,  the Home News, of New  Brunswick, N.J.,  published  an  article  on  the achievements of  the Neighbor hood Care Team, and it is hereby  in serted in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:  [From the Home News, Oct. 3, 1977]  NEIGHBORHOOD CARE TEAM Is THERE To SERVE  ELDERLY  (By Valerie Hendy)  NEw BRUNswrcK.-Her apartment has been  robbed once and she has been mugged twice  on the streets of the city. She suffered minor  injuries as a result of those muggings within  the last three years, but Mrs. Genevieve Gar cia, 71, is not bitter.  ""I  just want my  legal rights,""  said Mrs.  Garcia quietly at  a  staff meeting of  the  Neighborhood Care Team Project  at  the  Joyce Kilmer House recently.  It is the legal and human rights of New  Brunswick's 6,000 elderly citizens which con cern  the newly formed Neighborhood Care  Team, according  to Miss Dee Magnani,  the  project's coordinator and supervisor.  With a $240,000 grant from CETA, spon sored  by  the  Community  Development  Agency  of New Brunswick under Special  Projects Title VI, Miss Magnani and her staff  of 23 neighborhood workers, seek to identify  and assist those senior citizens who are ex periencing difficulty with public or private  service agencies.  English and Spanish speaking team work ers are available to help eligible elderly citi zens with needs varying from disputes with  unions over pensions  to  locating  low-cost  housing.  But Mis Magnani's team of young workers  do not devote themselves exclusively to ex tricating the elderly from the crush and con fusion of social service bureaucracy.  ""This  is an action group,"" Miss Magnani  said, ""they're out on the streets.""  The project's enthusiastic team of work ers, au referred to the project by Manpower,  have created several news services  for  the  aged which encompass members of the New  community at large.

Many of New Brunswick's senior citizens  have  suffered muggings  similar  to Mrs.  Garcia's while shopping downtown.  McCracken  thought  that  if youths who  might  be  inclined  to  rob  elderly  people  worked instead to know them and aid them,  future  robberies might be avoided.

DE.RWINSKI  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 18, 1977  ",1977
380,House,95,0.238,12,30,Mrs. SMITH of Nebraska.," Mr. Speaker,  I would like to state my support for the  resolution now before us which recog nizes the special characteristics of health  care in our Nation~ rural areas.  The National Guirielines  for Health  Planning as published  in  the Federal  Register of September 23, 1977, are in sensitive to the circumstances and con ditions under which small rural hospitals  must operate. They  impose unrealistic  requirements on  local health planning  agencies and place an intolerable bur den on those who would be required to  comply. They must be altered.  One of the failings of wide-sweeping,  all-encompassing,  in:flexible  regulations  promulgated by the Federal Government  is that there is no consideration given  for the diversity of culture, population  distribution,  and  geography  in  the  United States. This  resolution  recog nizes  these differences  in our country  and urges  the Federal Government  to  write regulations :flexible enough to give  rural health planners the capability to  provide  the best possible health care  services for rural residents.  Mr. Speaker, my congressional district  is primarily rural in nature. It encom passes about three-fourths of the land  area of the State of Nebraska and has  no  urban  center  larger  than  about  60,000 people. There are many elements  of the rules proposed by the Department  of Health, Education, and Welfare that  do not meet the needs of this rural area.  An  example  of  the problems  that  the new guidelines wo:~ld create for the  rural areas is in the section on hospital  bed population ratio.  The Greater Nebraska Health Sys tems Agency includes my entire congres sional district and other portions of the  State. It reports that it has a hospital  bed-population ration of 5.19 beds for  every 1,000 people. According to the pro posed HEW guidelines, a 4.0 average bed  per 1,000 ration will be expected. Even  the 5.1 ratio, however, is inadequate to  provide necessary services  for persons  living in rural areas. Medically under served areas such as my congressional  district are so vast that additional facili ties are needed  just  to make hospital  services geographically accessible to the  spare population. There are 90,000 square  miles in my district, for instance.  To give an example of the medical sit uation  there, a person can  travel 258  miles over Nebraska highways, passing  through 14 towns and 8 counties, with out visiting a  town or county with a  doctor's services. These are eight adjoin ing counties along the same stretch of  highway. There are 16 counties out of  the 61  in my district without a doctor,  another 5 counties only have 1 doctor and  11 counties have only 2 doctors.  Another reason more hospital beds are  needed  is  that a higher percentage of  elderly live in rural areas. A total of 15.3  percent of all the people  in rural Ne braska are considered elderly as com pared to 10 percent nationally. This cre ates a greater demand on rural hospital  services. These considerations also un dermine the need for the SO-percent oc cupancy  requirement outlined  in  the  HEW guidelines. There must be beds  available for the elderly when they are  needed.  A total of 64 of the 67 hospitals in the  greater Nebraska area had occupancy  levels of  less  than 80 percent in 1976.  This occupancy rate which was  lower  than that proposed  in  the regulations  occurred  because  rural  hospitals  are  small. The average size hospital in the  great Nebraska area  is 43 beds. These  smaller hospitals can operate at a lower  occupancy level and still be efficient.  The proposed guidelines pertaining to  obstetrical services also call for ""at least  500 deliveries annually in lower popu lated areas except in the case of a unit  serving an area where normal traveltime  exceeds 45 minutes."" This is unacceptable  for at least two reasons: With the great  number of elderly living in rural areas,   hospitals  there cannot be expected  to  have numerous deliveries of babies; and  even  though  the Greater Nebraska  Health Systems Agency estimates that  only 7 percent of the population travels  in excess of 30 miles to a hospital, the  area is subject to severe weather condi tions throughout the year. These condi tions greatly atfect accessibility  to the  hospitals.  Mr. Speaker, only 5 of the 67 hospitals  in the Greater Nebraska area had more  than 500 deliveries in 1976. It is impos sible for me to believe that 500 deliveries  per year  is a  reasonable standard for  rural hospitals.  These are just a  few of the reasons  that I believe the proposed guidelines for  health planning are unreasonable  for  rural areas. There must be some con sideration given to the unique situations  found  in places  like my congressional  district.  The resolution we are now consider ing expresses the sense of the Congress  that these regulations be rewritten to re :flect rural needs. I believe it is an action  we must take to restore fairness to the  health planning process.  I strongly urge all of my colleagues those who represent urban districts as  well as rural-to vote in favor of this  resolution and help prevent rural Ameri ca from being discriminated against once  more.  GENERAL  LEAVE  ZI)   ",1977
381,,95,-0.168,25,30,Mr. MAHON.," Mr. Speaker, I ask unan imous consent  that all Members may  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE  38401  have 5 legislative days in which to re vise and extend their remarks on the  joint resolution just agreed to.  ",1977
382,House,95,-0.163,38,30,Mr. LUKEN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup port of the amendment which would al low for the operation of a special crisis  intervention program to assist families  with meeting the cost of their ever-esca lating fuel bills.  I must point out that this program will  not come into operation until an emer gency situation warrants such action.   Last year the Congress approved such a  program retrospectively. This year, by  acting before the crisis is upon us, we  can be more assured of an efficient, well planned, distribution of funds should the  need arise.  Last year over $13,000,000 of the allo cated funds for  this program went  to  the State of Ohio, assisting over 30,000  households and 50,000 individuals. Last  year, many Ohio residents were faced  with a situation of either paying their  fuel bills or their food bills. It should  not be an either/or situation.  The high cost of fuel  is a problem  which is escalating in proportion. I am  certainly not in favor of Federal assist ance programs for every household item  which is a victim of inflation. But I do  not believe that it is excessive, or un wise,  to offer some assistance, to those  people who are forced to live on a fixed  income, in payment of their fuel costs.  I do not believe it is excessive to offer  some relief to those who dread the on coming winter due to the fact that they  will not be able to meet the cost of that  winter on an already strained budget.  This is not a handout. It is simply an  offer to defray, if the situation warrants  such action,  the cost of excessive fuel  bills for  those, who because of limited  incomes, find it increasingly difficult to  get by in the winter months.  I might also add Mr. Speaker,  that  this is not a program only for the North east and Midwest States. The program  which Congress approved last spring pro vided assistance  to all  regions of  the  country.  High cost for fuel is a universal prob lem facing this country. I do not think  we should turn a way from it. I urge my  colleagues to concur with the Senate on  this issue.  ",1977
383,House,95,-0.126,51,30,Mr. WATKINS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  ask  the Members  to continue the B-1  program to build planes Nos. 5 and 6.  I stand here and speak to the Members  because of my concern for this program.  Because of this concern, I went to Ed wards Air Force Base during Thanks giving for 2 days to review the B-1. After  returning, I wrote to our President and  Commander in Chief and expressed my  concern.  I know  there  is not much new sub stance or perhaps not many new facts to  relate, but I would like to point out one  thing that is new. It is new with me, and  it may be new with the Members.  If we do not have the B-1 bomber, we  will have to rely on the slow, cumbersome  B-52. The B-52 is twice as slow as the  B-1. The B-52 can be tracked by radar  a lot quicker, and it can be intercepted by  fighters more quickly. The enemy fight ers can move in a lot quicker against the  B-52.  The B-52's would have to release much  earlier  the cruise missiles, which have  not actually been perfected and whose  reliability has not been proven. They are  not yet proven with a moving  launch  pad such as the B-52.  The fact that I discovered, the one I  would like to share with the Members, is  this: With our enemy being able to in tercept the B-52 probably within 1,200 to  1,500 miles from its target, and with the  B-52 having to release the cruise mis siles that can travel at 350 knots, that  means our President and our Commander  in Chief will have to make his decision  4 hours earlier to release the cruise mis siles in order that those missiles may be  able to get to the target. He would have  to make  the decision  to  release  those  cruise missiles 4 hours before they would  be able to reach their target.  These missiles  are unmanned,  they cannot be recalled.  President Truman  in World War II  had the option of recalling those bomb ers in the last few moments, but here our  Commander in Chief would have there sponsibility of making his final decision  4 hours before the cruise missiles could  reach their target. With the sophistica tion of the radar that we have on board  and will soon develop, we may be able to  detect every move of the enemy. If we  should fir j  that the enemy is willing to  withdraw or negotiate during  that 4hour period, it would be a disaster and  a  tremendous  tragedy since our Com mander in Chief would not be able to reand  call  the cruise missiles.  I ask we con tinue  the B-1 bomber  to give us  the  strongest' national defense and the na tional security of our country.  ",1977

His passing  leaves an emptiness in this body which  can never be filled.  As a freshman Senator, I had occasion  to seek Senator McClellan's advice, and  I was profoundly impressed by his de votion to public service and the welfare  of our Nation. During his nearly 40 years  in elective office, he earned a well-de served  reputation for courage, convic tion, and integrity. Although he served  in one of the most important and in fluential posts in the Senate, he retained  his high regard for the individual citizen  and his concern for  the needs of  the  individual. On numerous occasions, I in troduced visiting constituents from Ha waii to the distinguished senior Senator  from Arkansas, in the Dirksen Senators'  Dining Room where  he  customarily  lunched, and invariably by his unfeigned  courtesy and a  few choice expressions,  he left a lasting, favorable impression on  them.  The people of Arkansas can be truly  proud of their great public servant, the  late John L. McClellan. By his passing,  the people of the United States have  suffered an immeasurable loss.

390,,95,-0.547,246,30,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Speaker, the resi dents of Michigan's 12th District  join  with me  in congratulating  the Utica  High School Chieftain Marching Band  on being selected to participate in the  Orange Bowl Parade of 1977.  The Chieftains Marching Band was  selected from a field of over 400 highly  competent and competitive high school  bands. The auditioning was  long and  arduous,  yet  the  highly  enthusiastic  members oi  this well-disciplined  team  had the stamina and determination to  continue and remain a favorite in the  competition.  Part of this congratulation should be  directed to the taskmaster of this highly  motivated musical  force,  the director,  Mr. Nawrocki. A marching band with  the high energy and unsinkable spirit of  the Utica Chieftains requires the same  energy and strength of its director. Mr.  Nawrocki has provided that same energy  and strength  in his direction of  the  Chieftains Marching Band.  I will be watching the Orange Bowl  Parade this year with a special sense of  Soviet Union,  this  is beyond  imagination.  Soviet trade unions do not protect the work ers against hunger, persecution or exploita tion. Labor unions in the U.S.S.R. are part  of  the party-government machine, which  addresses itself not to the defense of the in terests of working people, but only to the  implementation of party-government pro jects. Even the Soviet Supreme Court, having  looked into the practice of court cases in volving Ulegal firings, was forced to point out  that the labor union organizations are not  observing labor legislation and do not de fend the workers actively enough. Workers'  complaints to labor union organizations are  handed over by them to the KGB. In the ver dict of the court in the political case of the  truckdriver, Vladimir Pavlov  (Maikoptown,  1971), his complaint to the district council of  labor unions was taken to be material proof  of his guilt. So, there is nothing surprising  in the fact that for a  ten-year period,  the  chairman of the Soviet labor unions was the  former chairman of the KGB.""  6 See Dan C.

ED JONES  OF TENNESSEE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 6, 1977  ",1977
391,,95,-0.245,246,30,Mr. JONES of Tennessee.," Mr. Speaker,  a new soil and water conservation aware ness is building in this country and the  agricultural conservation program has  been revised  to refiect  this awareness.  Congress relied on advice from farmers,  conservationists, environmentalists, pro gram administrators and, yes, contrac tors before rewriting the act this fall.  You may -ask why farm State Repre sentatives in the Congress were persuad ed  to reform a program on which we  have lavished praise for decades. First  and foremost is that we,  too, have de veloped a new awareness of conservation  needs; and second, is the natural instinct  for survival.  ACP was under fierce attack. Envi ronmental interests complained ACP did  not emphasize ""long-term"" conservation  protection. An investigation by the con gressional watchdog <the Government  Accounting Office>  charged  that ACP  concentrated too much on production type practices. Taxpayers have frequent ly  voiced  the  concern  that  farmers  should be paying  for  the cost-shared  practices because  there were  few off farm benefits for Bociety. Farmers, on  the other hand, complained  that not  enough cost-sharing  funds have been  available to help meet the critical con servation needs on our agricultural land.  Debate on  local control versus  tighter  Federal guidelines has been continuous.  Believe it or not, Congress, in its own  plodding and frustrating way, mirrors  the feelings of the Nation at large and  responds  to the national mood. Farm oriented Representatives are outnum bered about 10 to 1 in the Congress; this  roughly reflects  the breakdown of  the  U.S. population. Each year it was a hard er fight  to protect ACP  from virtual  elimination.  At hearings on reforming ACP,  the  president of the National Limestone In stitute said:  Over the next few years,  the funds were  cut from $500 m1U1on a year to $250 mil lion-and recently they have been compro mised out at $190 m11110n. The $500 million  was when our National budget was $8.9  b1111on. And, yet, 1n recent years, this Pro gram has been operating at $190 m1111on  while our National budget has increased to  more than $450 billion.  President  Carter  in August  1977  voiced his concerns very specifically. He  had just asked Congress to consider ad ditional funding for ACP but he stated  he did so with reservations. He said:  I'm concerned that our soil conservation  programs, and  this program  ln particular,  are not as effective as they could or should  be. I fear that we have about 3,000 separate  conservation programs with  little national  guidance  or  problem  solving  orientation,  ",1977

393,House,95,0.502,337,30,Mr. DEVINE.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise  in  support of the conference report to ac company H.R. 9418, Health Professions  Education Amendments of 1977.  My support is not based, however, on  any conclusion that this legislation rep resents wise public policy. Rather,  it  merely is less onerous than existing law.  Currently, in order to be eligible for  capitation grants, schools of medicine  must reserve positions in each of school  years 1978-79, 1979-80, and 1980-81 for  an identified pool of U.S. students in for eign medical schools or special educa tional programs  in the United States.  These students would be equitably appor tioned among schools of medicine receiv ing capitation grants. U.S. citizens who  had enrolled in foreign medical schools  prior to October 12, 1976, date of enact ment of Public Law 94-484, had com pleted 2 years in such school, and had  passed part I of the National Board of  Medical Examiners' examination would  be eligible.  This is an outrageous infringement up on  the academic  freedom of medical  schools in that students would be as signed to schools without regard to ad mission standards.  Under the provisions of the conference  report, a school of medicine as a condi tion for receipt of capitation support ap propriated in fiscal years 1978, 1979, and  1980 must increase its third year enroll ment only in school year 1978 by 5 per cent over either the number of its full time  first-year or  third-year students  enrolled in school year 1977-78, which ever is lesser.  Schools of medicine could not count  CXXIII-24:36--Part 30  toward  the  increase  transfer students  who first, are aliens, second, are from  U.S. schools of medicine which have a  place for them in the third year, third,  first enrolled in a foreign medical school  after October 12, 1976, fourth, are from  schools of dentistry or osteopathy, or  fifth, are from unaccredited U.S. schools  of medicine.  The Secretary could waive the require ments.  in whole or part,  if: First, a  school's accreditation would be threat ened, second, inadequate population size  will prevent the school from providing  high quality clinical training for each of  its third-year students, or third, despite  a good faith effort an insumcient number  of students are eligible  to be counted.  Further, the requirement would be inap plicable  to a  school of medicine if  in  school year 1977-78 its enrollment of full time,  first-year  students  exceeded  its  full-time, third year students by 25 per cent or more.  Among those classes of individuals who  could be counted are those students who  had enrolled in foreign medical schools  prior to October 12, 1976, and those en rolled in special educational programs in  the United States. Schools could count  as third-year students, for purposes of  the enrollment  increase,  transfer stu dents enrolled in the second year who  were  first enrolled  in foreign medical  schools prior to October 12, 1976. There  is no reference to passing part I of the  National Board of Medical Examiners'  examination.  On page 10 of the conference report in  the statement of  the managers,  it  is  stated that the schools cannot use the  additional waiver authority after simply  applying their normal admission stand ards and finding ""no student eligible to  be counted under those standards.""  On page 11, it is mentioned that this  enrollment  increase requirement  in no  way infringes on the academic freedom  of schools of medicine to apply their own  admissions criteria.  The question arises, then, as to what  happens when the school, in good faith  application of its own admissions stand ards, determines that it is willing to ac cept those students who meet them but  an insufficient number can be selected  on merit.  That is, the pool of students is large  enough, but not after application of the  school's admissions criteria. What is the  extent of the school's obligation there after?  We know, of course, and I am sure the  gentleman from Florida will agree that  there is no authority for HEW to force  allocation of students whether or not  monies have been accepted. What re courses would be available-recollection  in whole or part? If pro tanto credit is  allowed, would  the schools be allowed  a partial capitation?  What disturbs me is that despite the  assertion  that the measure  in no way  infringes on  the academic freedom of  schools the conference report is silent on  the  results  that could  flow  from  the  school exercising its academic freedom.  The  decision  of  several  schools  to  forego capitation support unless the con raise a  significant question about  the  ditions for receipt were altered does not  utility of this funding mechanism as a  vehicle for accomplishing public policy  objections.  Instead,  it more  properly  raises questions about the appropriate ness of  the conditions of receipt as a  means  to accomplish the policy objec tives.  ",1977
394,House,95,-0.345,337,30,Mr. STAGGERS.," Mr. Speaker,  these  amendments to the Health Professions  Educational Assistance Act-Public Law  94-484-improve  the  legislation which  passed Congress nearly 1 year ago. The  bill requires medical schools in order to  be eligible  to  receive  capitation pay ments to increase their third-year class  enrollment by 5 percent and limits this  requirement  to fiscal year 1978 only.  Schools not complying with this require ment in fiscal year 1978 are ineligible  to receive capitation payments in fiscal  years 1979 and 1980. In addition,  this  legislation permits students enrolled in  medical schools which elect not to com ply with this requirement to participate  in  the health professions guaranteed  student loan program.  This  legislation  is supported by  the  Association of American Medical Col leges, as well as by the individual interest  groups  supporting American  students  studying medicine abroad.

395,,95,-0.406,428,30,Mr. MURPHY of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, the city of New York is about  to lose one of its most valuable public  servants. Police Commissioner Michael  Codd's second retirement marks the end  of a most remarkable career, the termi nation of a 36-year career during which  he rose the entire distance from the rank  of patrolman  to  chief  inspector-the  highest uniformed rank-when he first  retired in early 1973, and was later called  out of retirement  to become commis sioner at Mayor Beame's request.  Mike Codd was not only a good police man; he was also a good administrator.  The New York Police Department is a  multimillion dollar enterprise with an  extremely  intricate institutional struc ture. It is not only constantly changing  within itself, but within the environment  of the Nation's largest city. It is a posi tion which  requires  tough  executive  leadership, and those are the qualities  which he brought during his tenure.  It is not an easy job, but his supreme  handling of such emergency problems as  the power blackout and the city's fiscal  crisis which forced huge layoffs and other  ""economy"" moves within the police de partment, has brought the city a tradi tion of quality leadership which will be  hard to match. H1s has been an administrator known to be tough, honest, and  highly deserving of  the public's confi dence.  The words which he himself chose to  describe  the department's performance  during  recent  times of crisis are an  equally fitting tribute to his career: He  rose to the challenge and served the city  magnificently.

The conclusions were contained in a posi tion paper simultaneously released yesterday  at Miami, Tokyo, Paris and Montreal.  The group  includes four Nobel  laureates  and Stanford University's Dr. Edward Teller,  father of the H-bomb. Floyd Culler, director  of the oak Ridge National Laboratory, and  Alvin Weinberg, of oak Ridge, also took part  in the conference.  The 14 gathered at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,  last week at the invitation of the University  of Miami for a five-day ""International Scien tific Forum on an Acceptable Nuclear Energy  Future of  the World."" A  14-point white  paper was drafted by the group at the close  of the meeting. Its contents were disclosed  yesterday ..  The paper acknowledges there is a danger  that nuclear power  fac111ties wlll be con verted to production of weaponry. But the  scientists concluded that proper precautions  could prevent that. It found the threat of  nuclear accidents insufticient to abandon nu clear power projects.  The paper said fast breeder reactors, which  President Carter opposes for fear of nuclear  bomb proliferation, are among a number of  ""candidate systems"" to replace current meth ods of nuclear power production.  Dr. Behram Kursunoglu, director of the  University of Miami's Center of Theoretical  Studies, who was host to the conference, said  yesterday solar energy is impractical in the  foreseeable future because in addition to its  cost, it takes up too much space.  He estimated that nuclear fusion (harness ing the hydrogen atom) may be impractical  :for as much as 20 years. But he said nuclear  fusion might be combined with existing nu clear fission  techniques into an. acceptable,  efticient hybrid system before that.  CLARIFYING THE INTENT OF CON GRESS:  AUTHORIZING  ACCESS  ROADS FOR THE GREAT R~  ROAD  HON. JAMES L. OBERSTAR  OF MINNESOTA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 7, 1977  ",1977
397,,95,-0.553,428,30,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, today  I am introducing a bill to authorize ac cess spurs along the Great River Road  to cross the Mississippi River.  The Great River Road is a recreation al and scenic highway, running parallel  to the Mississippi River from Lake Itasca  in Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. It  was established by section 14 of the Fed eral-Aid Highway Act of 1954, Public  Law 83-350. Federal  funding  for  the  Great River Road was first authorized  by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973.  The 1973 act provided  that Federal  funds could be used on only one route  parallel to the river. It was the intent  of Congress that there not be two paral lel roads. However, States are allowed to  construct the Great River Road alternate  on the other side of the river with their  own money.  On November 22,  1976,  the Federal  Highway Administration <FHW A>  issued  regulations to govern Great River Road  construction. Aside from the one route  parnllel to  the river,  their regulations  provide  for  ''access spurs  to areas of  scenic enhancement proximate  to  the  Mississippi."" The FHW A has interpreted  the prohibition against roads on both  sides of  the river to mean that these  spurs cannot cross the river. The FHWA  feels it needs a specific expression of con gressional intent before it allows access  spurs to cross the river.  The result of the FHW A regulations  has caused a reduction in the scenic and  recreational value of  the Great River  Road. The purpose of the road is to pro vide for greater accessibility to places of  interest along  the  river. Access  spurs  enhance  this  accessibility. But when  those places of interest happen to lie on  the other side of the river, no access is  provided.  To remedy this situation, the legisla tion I am introducing specifically pro vides  that access spurs may cross  the  river, where necessary. The bill does not  allow Federal  funding of  either new  bridges across the river or two parallel  roads along the river route and does not  require new authorization or appropria tion.  Mr. Speaker, there are countless places  of scenic, historical,  and  recreational  interests along  the Great River Road  whose esthetic and cultural value should  be made available to all Americans.

398,,95,-0.316,441,30,Mr. GORE.," Mr. Speaker, I want to call  my colleagues' attention  tragedy  which has occurred recently in the dis trict I  represent  in  this House which  demonstrates a need for a  change  in  current law.  Early last month, James Jay Garman,  the commander of the ROTC Rangers at  Tennessee Technological University  in  Cookeville, was killed during a  training  exercise. Mr. Garman was  instructing  other cadets in important military skills  when he accidentally fell and was swept  over a waterfall. This young man was a  credit to his family, to his community,  and to this country's military service. As  one of his professors commented after  Jay's death, ""He represented the highest  standards of professionalism and integ rity and scholarship.""  The shock of this tragedy is only com pounded by the fact that, under existing  law, Jay's widow will apparently not be  eligible to receive benefits normally paid  to widows of U.S. servicemen killed in the  line of duty. Jay's death occurred in the  service of his country, as much so as the  death of any serviceman killed during  peacetime. But inquiries by members of  his family and my own  inquiries have  indicated that Jay's widow will receive  only the benefits of his group life insur ance policy, not the dependency indem nity  compensation ordinarily paid  widows of servicemen. I believe this is an  unfortunate oversight  in  the  law and  demonstrates  the need  for  legislative  changes to correct it.  I wish to insert here copies of the news paper articles published following Jay's  death last month. I hope that my col leagues will consider these articles as a  memorial to Jay and to the tradition of  patriotic service to his country which he  and his family believed in so much.  to  [Prom The Oracle (Tennessee Technological  University), Nov. 11, 1977]  ARLINGTON FUNERAL HELD  (By Tracy McMahan)  James Jay Garman, a 21-year-old senior  physical education major and commander of  the ROTC Rangers, was swept to his death  over the 100-foot Fancher's Falls in White  County during an ROTC training exercise on  Saturday, Nov. 5 about 10:30 a.m.  Garman, who was  buried yesterday  in  Arlington National Cemetery with full mili tary honors, was the son of Col. and Mrs.  Pred Garman of Cookeville.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Garman and nine Rangers, building a rope  bridge and practicing  rappellng during  a  training session lead by Garman at the falls,  were  fam111ar with  the wilderness area  in  White County where previous training ses sions had been held.  Walking down a  ledge above the falls to  secure a  rope, he lost his footing, and the  rapid waters carried him to his death. His  body was recovered about 12:45 a.m. at the  bottom of the falls from the waters of Center  Hill Lake.  Lt. Col. Jon Eiche, professor of M111tary  Science at TTU said, that Garman was work ing about 12 feet from the falls on a  rope  bridge located above the falls. He had built  bridges simllar to this several times before  and had already been up and down the slope  three or four  times;  therefore, he used no  safety hookups.  On the east bank the rope got tangled in  branches; as he went down the slope to free  the rope he lost his footing about five feet  above the water.  The Rangers on the opposite bank watched  helplessly as the strong current forced their  commander over the 100-foot falls and held  him underwater at the base of the falls. The  water was moving rapidly because of recent  rain.  Garman screamed twice, but, according to  White County Deputy Melvin Werley, there  was no way he could escape the falls. ""The  water there is very rapid because it has oeen  traveling over a stair-step of smaller falls by  the time it reaches the large one,"" Deputy  Wherley said.  Another group of ROTC students were in  training five miles away at Tech Aqua under  the supervision of Major Yates, deputy pro fessor  of M111tary  Science,  and Captain  Stempel, assistant professor of M111tary Sci ence. The other students did not join in the  search, but Cpt. Stemple came to the falls  and took the other nine Rangers away from  the scene of the accident.  Cpt. Stempel said the nine Rangers con dt:cted themselves in the best manner pos sible. After searching about  two hours, a  rescue squad boat using dragging equipment  found Garman's body at the base of the falls.  According  to  other Rangers who  have  trained  in  the area before,  the water at  the bottom of the falls varies in depth from  around 18 inches to 20 feet, and Garman was  probably held by an undertow in dooper areas  of the water.  Garman, a graduate of James Robinson  High School in Fairfax County Virginia, has  always been an active participant in school  activities. In high school he was president  of the student government, captain of the  track team, and a member of ""Who's Who In  American High Schools.""  Entering TTU in 1974 as a physical educa tion major, he got involved in many aspects  of campus life. During the past three years  he was a member of the track team, a presi~  dent of the P.E. Club, and a resident adviser  for two years in Maddux-McCord in 1975-76,  and in Cooper-Dunn in 1976-77.  He served as head resident of Warf and  Elllngton Halls  this year. Also,  he  took  photos at home football games and on cam pus for the University Photo Services.  He had a  three-year ROTC  scholarship  that he  received after his  first year as a  ROTC cadet. He received the Distinguished  Military Graduate award and several other  awards.  ,He graduated  from  the U.S. Army Air borne School and  the U.S. Army Ranger  Training Fort Benning, Ga. His  training  record was  so outstanding  that he was  allowed to wear the Ranger Tab earned rarely  by U.S. Army officers in active duty.    Garman  leaves behind his wife of  two  months, Jerrie Jennings Garman, a  senior  journalism major, and former ORACLE man aging editor and  former photographer  for  the Hearld-Citizen;  his parents, Col.  and  38817  Mrs. Garman, 125 Scenic Lane; four brothers,  Frederick Garman  of Falls Church, Va..;  Joseph and Thomas Garman of Cookev1lle;  Wilia.m Garman, a TTU sophomore; and one  sister, Teresa Jane Garman, a. TTU freshman.  Memorial services were held at Hooper &  Huddleston Funeral home on Tuesday with  Rev. Dan Haskins officiating. Rev. Haskins,  who  is  the BSU  advisor  at Tech,  also,  officiated  at  the  graveside  services  at  Arlington National Cemetery.  FRIENDS COMMENT  I would not do justice to Jay Garman, who  died Saturday during an ROTC  training  exercise at Fancher's Falls, to paint him as  a. one-dimensional person. Rather, he was a.  multi-dimensional person who would not fit  a  typical stereotype of an arxny ca.roor man.  Jay  displayed  various  interests  and  a.  multitude of talents. Lt. Col. Jon Eiche, pro fessor of Military Science, said, ""He demon strated leadership qualities in every facet of  life."" According to Jay's friends and superiors  a. major part of his life could be summed up  in three words: challenges, competition, and  care.  The outdoors and the mllltary presented  many challenges for him. He graduated from  the U.S. Army Airborne School and was one  of few Tech ROTC students to complete the  U.S. Army Ranger Training Program at Fort  Benning, Ga..  The Ranger program is one of the most  rigorous offered by the ROTC program. His  superiors were hesistant to let him go into  the Ranger training, his friends said, but he  met  the challenge and returned with  the  coveted Ranger Tab.  Captain Stempel, a professor of Mllltary  Science and advisor of the Orienteering Club,  said, ""Jay thrived on challenges."" He set his  goals high and although some of them were  unfulfilled, he always tried to do his best and  learn  from  his  experiences  according  to  Stempel.  Charles Fletcher another ROTC student,  recalled that Jay said, ""It isn't adventure if  everybody does it.""  He was a. member of the Orienteering Club  and often helped president Jeff Ma.cintlre  organize activities. In 1976 he placed oixth  out of 80 contestants in the Vanderbilt Ori enteering Contest helping his team take first  place.  Cpt. Stempel said that he played a. regula tion role in Jay's life often telllng him ""no""  when he wanted to engage in risky out door  training.  However, he not only enjoyed the challenge  the outdoors offered; nature also offered him  chances to laugh and love. Steve Swann, a.  friend of Jay's, told of one 45-mlle hiking  trip in the Smokeys last summer on which  Jay and his  friends  relaxed and  laughed  together.  The Reverend Dan Haskins, Tech BSU di rector and friend of the Garman family, said,  ""Jay was raised in an extremely warm family  situation, and high moral values were  in stllled in him.""  Jay participated in athletic competition.  He ran cross-country track and played tall back for the football team at James Robinson  High School in Fairfax County, Virginia..  He was a. member of the TTU track team  and broke one relay record. All of his friends  said he liked to keep in top-notch physical  shape. Ma.cintire said, ""His most unfa.vorite  type people were lazy people who didn't try.""  He did not neglect academic competion.  He  recieved a  three year ROTC scholarship  during his first year as a. cadet in ROTC and  had a QPA of around 3.6 He was president of  the Student Government in high school and  was listed in Who's Who In American High  School Students.  Lastly, Garman showed he cared. He took  pictures  for  the University  Photographic  Service. His  interest  in photography was  ",1977

400,,95,-0.339,493,30,Mr. BIAGGI.," Mr. Speaker, picture if  you can Manhattan with ""huge aborigi nal trees, weeds that were strawberries,  catnip and blackberries; wild geese, tur keys, pigeons, and ducks;  rivers  filled  with fish."" Imagine further, Greenwich  Village as farmland complete with graz ing cattle. This is not imagination on my  part but rather historical reality as re counted in a  fascinating article which  appeared in the December 7 New York  Times.  The article written by Edith Evans  Asbury focuses on the little known fact  that black slaves imported by the Dutch  West India Co. were emancipated and  became  the  farm  owners during  the  mid-17th century. Farming was then as  it is  today a  rigorous occupation, and  many in the early days of Manhattan  lacked the desire and stamina to be farm  owners and operators.  Unfortunately the emancipation of the  black slaves was short lived. By the 1670's  Britain had  instituted chattel slavery  38869  into New York severely restricting freed  blacks  including a prohibition against  owning property.  I submit this article for the historical  edification of my colleagues. As we look  to the roots of Manhattan we discover  that then as now, it is the people that  make her great.  The article follows:  FREED BLACK FARMERS TILLED MANHATTAN'S  SoiL IN THE 1600'S  (By Edith Evans Asbury)  Before it was Chatham Square, before it  was Astor Place, before  it was Greenwich  Village and before it was Herald Square, the  crowded Manhattan land now designated by  those  names was  farmland,  and  in  the  1640's, while it was controlled by the Dutch,  much of  it came  into  the hands of freed  black slaves. Blacks caught up in the surg ing  interest  in genealogy aroused by  the  book and television film ""Roots,"" may find  their American  ancestry goes back much  further than they thought if they 'check the  minutes of  the Dutch Burgumasters and  Schepens-the New Amsterdam Town Coun cil-or other yellowing documents  in  the  city's new Department of Archives, libraries  and historical societies.  It was a casual remark by a history buff,  Paul O'Dwyer, the City Council President,  that there were black farmers here in the  time of  the Dutch  that set a  reporter on  the trail of further  information about the  little-known fact. And along that trail, even  professional  historian<>  were  encountered  who had never heard of  the 17th-century  black farmers in Manhattan.  ELEVEN BLACK MEN ARRIVE  Shortly after Peter Minuit bought  the  Manhattan Island from the Manhattan In dians in 1626, 11 black men arrived.  They came on a ship owned by the Dutch  West India Company, whic'l had sent Min uit to be Governor of Nieuw Netherlands, a  trading post  to which  the company had  sent 30 families with horses and cattle in  1623.  Manhattan  land was  rich and  fruitful  then. There were huge,  aboriginal  trees.  weeds  that were  strawberries, catnip and  blackberries;  wild  geese,  turkeys,  wild  pigeons and ducks. The rivers were full of  perch,  sturgeon,  bass,  herring, mackerel,  weakfish, stonebeam and eel. Oysters were  so large that ""one must cut them in two or  three pieces,"" an enthusiastic Dutch set-.  tler wrote  to a  friend  in the Netherlands.  There were large quantities of oyster shells  to burn for lime. Timber was abundant and  so were quarrystones, and  the day was of  fair quality for bricks and tile.  Eighteen  years  after Minuit  purchased  Manhattan,  in 1644, 11 black slaves, peti tioned the Dutch West India Company for  their  freedem and, possibly  to  their own  astonishment, got it.  All of the 11  freed slaves may not have  been the same 11 who came to New Amster dam in 1626, but at least four of them were.  These four, whose names probably indicate  their country of origin, were Paulo d'Angola,  Simon Congo, Antony Portuguese and John  Francisco.  REWARD FOR SERVICE  The others freed in 1644 were Big Manuel,  Little Manuel, Manuel de Gerrit de Rens,  Peter Santome, Little Anthony and John Fort  Orange.  The slaves were granted their freedom, and  land in Manhattan on which to farm, as a  reward for 18 or 19 years of service to the  Dutch West  India Company, according  to  records of  that  time.

It is appropriate that we pause and  celebrate the birthday of Jesus Christ.  I ask that we jointly turn our thoughts  to the famous Christmas story found in  the Gospel of Luke, chapter 2, verses 114, which reads:  CHAPTER 2  And it came  to pass  in  those days,  that  there went out a decree from Caesar Augus tus, that all the world should be taxed.  2.  (And this  taxing was first made when  Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)  3. And all went  to be  taxed, every one  into his own city.  4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee,  out of  the city of Nazareth,  into Judaea,  unto the city of David, which is called Beth lehem:  (because he was of  the house and  lineage of David:)  5. To be  taxed with Mary his espoused  wife, being great with child.  6. And so  it was,  that, while  they were  there, the days were accomplished that she  should be delivered.  7. And she brought forth her first-born  son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes,  and  laid him  in a manger;  because  there  was no room for them in the inn.  8. And  there were  in  the same country  shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch  over their flock by night.  9. And,  lo,  the angel of  the Lord came  upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone  round  about  them:  and  they were  sore  afraid.  10. And  the angel said unto  them, Fear  not:  for, behold,  bring you good  tidings  of great joy, which shall be to rll people.  11. For unto you  is born this day in the  city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the  Lord.  12. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye  shall  find  the babe wrapped  in swaddling  clothes, lying in a manger.  13. And suddenly there was with the angel  a multitude of  the heavenly host praising  God, and saying,  14. Glory  to God in the highest, and on  earth peace, good will  toward men.

I have been told there may be such a  piece of legislation offered in the Senate  today and under their rules that can be  done and perhaps even passed. What  happens if we get very cold weather be tween now and the 19th of January? Is  there any possibility we might get such a  piece of legislation here today?  ",1977
403,House,95,0.371,623,30,Mr. CONABLE.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the  two  distinguished  gentlemen  for  their expressions in favor of this meas ure. Larry Woodworth worked for  the  Joint Committee on Internal Revenue  Taxation for more than 30 years per forming in a central capacity and in a  manner which I believe earned him the  respect of the Members of this body and  the other body. He is indeed central in  the planning of our tax laws. He was one  of the most highly skilled tax experts in  this country, and a person who could  have made a great deal more money in  some other position had he wished  to  leave the service of the Government.  He pursued his course here with self lessness and with extreme hard work  and determination. Under  the circum stances, I believe it is entirely appro priate  that we make  an  exception  to the rule, because of the length of time  he worked for the Congress, because of  the fact that he had only just recently  left and continued to have a very impor tant  role  in communication with  the  Congress.

405,House,95,0.015,636,30,Mr. WAGGONNER.," Mr. Speaker, the  easy answers for financing social secu rity are all gone. There are no easy  answers left. All we are left with are bad  alternatives, and I submit to the Mem bers that this conference report is  the  best of those bad alternatives.  What are our options? Our options  are, first, to do what this conference re port proposes. This  legislation does  a  number of things that many of you are  interested in, and in spite of what some  say,  it does  improve the present social  security system. It is a better bill than  the House passed and better than the  Senate passed.  This does  raise  taxes, but  it  raises  benefits later for people who pay those  taxes, and salaries are going up  from  which to pay those taxes. I dislike this  as much as anyone but it is necessary.  This conference report maintains par ity, and manv of those who oppose this  legislation will admit that has been a big  argument. We  do not unbalance  the  emoloyer-employee contributions.  This does not allow Treasury borrow ing, and many of the Members who are  opposed to this conference report have  been opposed  to Treasury borrowing.  You say it would convert social security  to a welfare program and I agree.  The conference report does decouple.  It corrects the mistake we made in 1972.  It stabilizes the trust fund, because the  actuary says that the OASDI trust fund  will be stabilized until the year 2030. The  DI trust fund will be stabilized until the  year 2007, and the combined trust fund  will be stabilized until the year 2027. If  we do not do this, the DI trust fund will  be bankrupt by 1979.  The OASDI trust fund will be bank rupt in 1982. What will you do then? I  will tell you what-you will borrow from  the Treasury.  Put it off until next year? How many  of the Members are going to have nerve  next year to raise the tax rate and sta bilize the trust fund when it is an election  year which we do not have now? Few  indeed, because most of you will be try ing to save your political hides instead  of social security.  Bite  the bullet? You will be biting  marshmallows then because you will not  bite that bullet now. You are going to  run  from  it. How many of you will  change your minds between now and  January? Few if any.  Mr. Sneaker, the second alternative to  this  is Treasury financing, and Treas ury financing  is what many Members  have been  trying to avoid, but that is  what you are going to have if you vote  against  this conference  report. If you  vote against this conference report to day you are casting a vote for Treasury  financing of  social security when  the  trust fund goes broke and that is  just  around  the corner. Can you  live with  that? I think not.  Of  course, Mr.  Speaker,  there  is  another alternative and  that  is  to do  nothing ever. Just consign social secu rity  to  the  tube. Say  to hell with  it.  And I submit that is almost what you  are doing if you reject this conference  report.  ",1977
406,House,95,-0.19,649,30,Mr. AMBRO.," Mr. Speaker, although I  voted for the conference report on the  bill to provide adequate financing for the  social security system, I  firmly believe  that substantive redrafting of legislation  to insure the solvency of the trust funds  is needed. The increases in both the tax able wage base and the percentage rate  contained in this bill will have so severe  an impact on the average American tax payer and will result in such a huge drain  on the economy, generally, ~hat a large  Federal tax reduction is a necessity.  When  the House of Representatives  originally considered this bill, I did not  favor the use of money from general rev enues to offset the contributions made  into the system by the employer and the  employee. The specific provisions of the  conference report, however, require that  we take a second look at the possibility of  using general revenue funds for a portion  of the money needed by the social secu rity system. Since its inception, the trust  funds have been supported on a bipod of  employer/employee  contributions,  but  now we must.seriously consider institut ing a tripod of employer /employee/gen eral revenue funds to support the social  security system. A tripod of this nature  would give increased stability to the so cial security system,  especially  if we  could-and we can-devise a practica.ble  formula to use the third leg only when  the other two weaken.  I was unhappy with  the Ketchum  amendment to the original version of this  bill, but I supported it, inasmuch as there  was no alternative, but the conferees'  version of the earnings limitation is sim ply not responsive to present-day circum stances. I have sponsored legislation dat ing back to 1975 which would increase  the outside earnings limitation to $7,500  immediately-a  figure which  is more  realistic than this bill provides in these  infiationary times.  I sincerely hope that the Commission  on Social Security created by this bill will  be able to make a comprehensive study  of the social security system and recom mend remedies for the ills of the system  so that we will be in a position to draft  amendments to this bill in the near fu ture which will be more deliberatively  practical to the working man and woman,  to the employer, and to the Nation as a  whole.  A yes vote on this debatable measure  means only that I solidly support the at tempts-however hastily conceived-to  assure the solvency of the social security  trust fund, but I do so with the conviction  that this bill desperately needs in-depth  review and revision.  ",1977
407,House,95,-0.316,649,30,Mr. GORE.," Mr. Speaker, we are about  to make a grave mistake by passing this  bill. There is no question about the fact  financial  foundation.  I  support  that  that we must put social security on a firm  effort wholeheartedly. However, there are  good ways to accomplish that goal and  bad ways to accomplish that goal.  The imposition of a highly regressive  increase in the payroll tax is the wrong  way to strengthen social security. The  payroll tax hits hardest at working fam ilies and small business and, in general,  at those who can least afford to pay it.  It is already too high.  Early in this century, when the late  Secretary of State Cordell Hull was a  young Congressman  representing  the  same district I now serve, he led the fight  in favor of the principle of progressive  taxation. The reform he championed can  be stated quite simply: ""Those who can  most afford it should be asked to carry a  larger share of the tax burden; those who  have fewer resources should be asked to  pay a proportionately smaller percent age.''  This bill does precisely the opposite.  That  is  the reason I opposed  it last  month and the reason I oppose it again  today.  In addition, the taxes imposed by this  blll wlll have an enormous inflationary  effect. We are told that this defect will  be remedied by next year's reduction in  the income tax-a proposal which began  as a tax reform.  However, the tandem effect of these  two bills will be to shift the entire Amer ican tax structure toward a much more  regressive system.  As a new Member of this body, I op pose this bill somewhat reluctantly be cause of my respect for the wisdom and  experience of so many of my colleagues  who are supporting  it and who have  labored  long and hard  to fashion  it.  Nevertheless, I am convinced that it is  an undemocratic,  regresftive measure,  and I intend to vote against it once again.  I insert into the RECORD at this point  a column by Mr. Tom Wicker of the New  York Times which further discusses the  reasons this blll should be defeated:  PAYROLL TAX-UP, UP, UP  (By Tom Wicker)  President Ca.rter seems eager for House Senate conferees to break their deadlock on  the minor t.ssue of a college-tuition tax credit  so they can send him a finished Social Secur ity blll in this calendar year. But the Amer ican people would be better off if the dead lock lasted long enough for this massive tax  blll to be recognized for the economic dis aster it is. For example:  Long-term tax increases totaling 227 bil lion dollars would be  imposed  in regular  steps between 1979 and 1987. Note that the  Congress that voted this body-blow to the  American wallet prudently put off the first of  the increases until after its members try to  get themselves re-elected next year.  These payroll tax increases are regressive  and severe. Under current law, a worker pay ing the ma.xtmum tax in 1979 would have  been hit for 6.0 percent of the first $18,900 of  his  earnings,  or  $1,143.45, which  is bad  enough; under the new blll, a worker at the  maximum would pay 6.13 percent on $22,900,  or $1,403.77, in 1979. How does a new one year tax bite of $260.32 grab you?  By 1987, workers and employers will be  taxed at 7.15 percent on the first $42,600 of  income-$3,045.90 at  the maximum. Thus,  over the life of the b111, the payroll taxes of  persons paying the m!I.Ximum will be nearly  tripled, 11.8 wtll the matching taxes of their  employers.  The increases are infta.tlonary, since it 1s  an established economic fact that most em ployers pass on payroll ta.x increases to the  consumer via higher prices. Thus, Congress  has voted strong upward pressure on  the  price level in each of the years from 1979  through 1987.  Despite the genera.!  infiationa.ry effect, in  some cases, the blll might also work against  employment. Some employers might either  not hire new hands or reduce  their work  forces as a hedge against increasing employ ment costs.  In addition to these effects on  infiation  and employment,  the payroll  tax  increases  wlll cut heavily into workers' buying power.  At one and  the same  time, Congress has  managed a blll that will depress the economy  and fuelinfiation.  President Carter's plan to cut income taxes  to compensate for these effects, even 1f passed  won't necessarily help  that much. Annua.i  income tax reduction will certainly not stop  employers from passing weekly and monthly  payroll  tax  increases  to  consumers;  and  whether payroll deductions for income taxes  can be reduced sufficiently to maintain buy ing power  remains  to be seen. Remember  that Social Security comes ""off the top"" of  the worker's weekly check; an income tax  refund at the end of the year won't put food  on the table day by day.  Some may ask, ""But what could Congress  do? How else could it save Social security?""  Well, it could have ""saved"" Social Security  by doing what other industralized countries  do--feeding  general  fund  revenues  into  tripartite system supported by employers,  employees and the general revenues for 25 to  45 percent of their social insurance funding;  West Germany has been using 15 to 33 per cent general funding since 1891  (I am in formed by Alfred Kutztk of the University  of Maryland at Baltimore).  Most of  the planners of  the American  Social Security originally envisioned, when  doing their work in the 1930's, that some time in the 1960's it would become necessary  to put general fund revenues into the sys tem. What's more, the Federal Government  has been matching all medical insurance con tributions, to the Medicare system since 1965.  Where's the difference in principle? Yet, Con gress remains wedded to the myth that to  support Social security with general revenues  would convert it to ""welfare.""  Mr. Carter must know that's poppycock. He  proposed unsucceessfully that in years when  unemployment exceeds 6 percent, the Treas ury should contribute the difference between  Social Security taxes actually collected and  what they would have totaled at 6 percent  unemployment. His later proposal to lower  income  taxes  in compensation  for higher  payroll taxes would indirectly divert general  funds to Social Security financing. Even the  original House bill provided for automatic  Treasury loans to the Social Security trust  funds if they fell below 25 percent of annual  outlays; but  this  sensible beginning step  toward general funding did not survive.  Mr. Carter nevertheless is eager to claim  the ""rescue"" of Social Security as a  legisla tive achievement. Since the system is in no  immediate danger (whatever alarmists say),  payroll taxpayers might welcome instead a  veto of this huge, inflationary tax increase  and a new start next year.  ",1977

My constituents  in these industries have f:xpressed their  concerns about the onerous permitting  requirements under the Army Corps' 4""04  program.

409,,95,-0.336,1273,30,Mr. BONKER.," Mr. Speaker, some re cent articles on the Peace Corps indicate  that despite a change in the leadership  of ACTION nearly a year ago, the Peace  Corps has not emerged from its lethargy.  The problem is rather straightforward:  if the Peace Corps is to be revitalized and  given a fresh start it must be independ ent. The Peace Corps cannot be independent and part of ACTION at the same  time.  In October, Mr. HARRINGTON, Mr. GIL MAN, Mr. NIX, Mr. TSONGAS and myself  introduced the Peace Corps Reform Act,  H.R. 9774. Thus far we have been joined  by over 20 cosponsors. This legislation  will give the Peace Corps the freedom, the  tlexibility, and the mandate it needs to  fulfill its potential as the most etfective  and efficient  foreign aid program  this  country has to offer to developing coun tries.  Mr. Speaker,  I  submit  two  articles  which  recently appeared  in  the Wall  Street Journal and the Washington Post  for the RECORD and encourage my col leagues to give serious consideration to  important  questions  surrounding  the  future of the agency.  (From the Washington Post, Dec. 11, 1977)  THE PEACE CORPS  IN LmERIA:  FRUSTRATION,  LrrrLE SUPPORT  (By Mike Keller)  MONROVIA, LmERIA.-Four months after he  made the grueling 17-hour bus trip to the  remote vlllage of Webbo,  the 26-year-old  Peace Corps practical nurse packed his be longings and returned here, frustrated in his  attempt as the first outsider to offer health  services in that remote part of the world.  The motorcycle which had been promised  to the former Army nurse for work in the  neighboring villages never showed up.  The medical supplies he had brought with  him  lasted about a month. He scrounged  more in a nearby vlllage, but even a hefty  supply of chloraquine doesn't last long in a  nation ravaged by malaria.  The  greatest  frustration,  however, was  that in the four months he was in Webbo,  no one at the Peace Corps oftlce in Monrovia.  responded  to his messages,  let alone made  provisions to supply him with the essentials  to do his job.  Since his return to Monrovia, he has been  teaching at the U.S.-bullt hospital, but he  plans  to  leave Liberia.  this month,  a. year  before his two-year tour of duty is supposed  to be over.  The most disturbing element of these ex periences is that they typify the complaints  Peace Corps volunteers in Liberia. have about  programming and placement.  ""You're looking  for  some direction and  support when you're here and you're not  getting it,""  the disgruntled volunteer said.  The irony is that the Peace Corps has con tributed sig~flcantly to Liberia's develop ment, and  today, when a  first-rate grass roots  assistance program  probably would  flourish, Peace Corps morale is bad and the  dropout rate among volunteers is estimated  at 30 per cent or higher.  An entire group of 11  rural development  volunteers  recently went home  early. An  education group of 67 volunteers which ar rived early this year had shrunk to 51 six  months later.  Such problems obviously are not entirely  new to the Peace Corps, but after 15 years  of operation in Liberia, the agency ought to  have a better handle on the situation.  FUNDS REDUCED  At bottom, of course, the problems can be  traced to money;  in eight years, the Peace  Corps budget has shrunk by nearly 20 per  cent.  In 1969, the budget was $102 million; the  current operating budget  is $82.9 million,  which translates into $15,000 per volunteer.  Of that amount, $1.1 mill1on is spent di rectly on the 240 or so volunteers in Liberia~   That's about $4,600 a. year, or  less than $400  a month per volunteer for everything-food,  housing, clothes, medical support, transportation,  furniture,  electricity  or  kerosene,  vacation allowance and incidentals.  By contrast, in-country support for a tech nician with  the Agency  for  International  Developmentcosts  between  $75,000  and  $80,000.  Volunteers don't want that level of sup port by any means;  they frown upon those  technicans because  their  inflated  lifestyles  impede their rapport and effectiveness here.  Volunteers, however, do feel monthly al lowances for housing, food and incidentals  are too low.  When gripes about this reached the em bassy, Ambassador W. Beverly Carter ordered  a cost-of-living survey. Allowances then were  raised to $198 a. month in Monrovia and $188  up-country, a $15 increase, but stlll $45 under  what the survey showed to be the minimum  for volunteer support.  The Peace Corps staff has its share of prob lems, of course, and one of  them  is  the  enormous  turnover both in Liberia. and in  Washington headquarters.  About a dozen administrative oftlcers have  come and gone in Liberia in the last two  years. The Peace Corps country director, Den nis M. Lucey,  reGlgned  in October, citing  frustration with Washington  as  a  xnajor  reason.  Washington didn't seem too keen on Lucey  either, and several Washington administra tors described  the Liberia. program under  Lucey as a ""trouble country"" for the Peace  Corps.  Frequent staff turnover, both overseas and  in Washington, has been deliberate. There's  a provision in the agency's enabling legisla tion known as ""the five-year flush."" The in tent is to ensure that the agency doesn't turn  into a  stodgy bureaucracy, but it also has  deprived the Peace Corps of continuity and  memory.  In Liberia,  the  level of staff support to  volunteers has eroded so badly, but ever so  gradually, that no one today realizes that the  Peace Corps used to do things dltferently.  EDUCATION BUDGET UP  How effective the Peace Corps has been can  be seen in the existence of a new breed of  Liberian-young, serious-minded and bent  upon uplifting their society-many of whom  were taught and influenced by Peace Corps  teachers.  More than 3,000 of these volunteers have  spent two years apiece in Liberia since 1962,  most of them as teachers in schools in the  interior. When the volunteers first arrived,  Liberia's education budget was $2.4 mUlion  and 708 schools were in operation. In 1975,  the most recent year for which figures are  available, there were 6,246 schools in Liberia,  190,799 pupils attending them and a budget  of $12.5 mlllion.  In an educational system geared to rote  learning,  there was no attempt to develop  independent and creative thought. The con sequences have been disastrous, a waste of  potential  talent  that a  developing nation  cannot afford.  Despite these obstacles, and often despite  their own lack of teaching experience, most  Peace Corps volunteers proved themselves in genious at  improvisin.g  teaching materials  and methods.  An American involved with education in  Liberia.  for 10 years said, ""Many very fine  students wlll say  that sometime  in  their  past they have had a volunteer teach them.  Especially  if they're originally from small  towns  in  the  interior, because volunteers  have been the only ones, by and large, who  have gone back there and really enjoyed it.""  AMERICAN  INFLUENCES  Liberia  is not an easy place  to compre hend for Americans with little or no previous  cross-cultural experience. There simply are  too many American  trappings here, so the  uninitiated often judge and relate to  this  society on American  terms.  ",1977
410,,95,0.12,1299,30,Mr. PURSELL.," Mr. Speaker, the Uni versity of Michigan football  team will  soon be competing in the annual Rose  Bowl game  in Pasadena, Calif., after  winning another Big Ten championship.  The University of Michigan represents  the very best aspects of higher education  in our country. It is an institution which  has been consistently ranked among the  finest in both academics and athletics.  Those of us from Michigan take a par ticular pride in the University of Michi gan and our other fine colleges and uni versities. But  I  think  the  balanced  standard of excellence demonstrated by  the University of Michigan in the class room and on the playing field can be a  source of pride for all of us.  As a means of special recognition for  the Michigan football team and Coach  ""Bo"" Schembechler, I would like to bring  to the attention of my fellow Members  the following article, written by the Uni versity of Michigan Sports Information  Director Will Perry:  IS  Bo's FOURTH ROSE BOWL TEAM  CHARACTERIZED AS MOST TENACIOUS  ANN Aauoa.-Coach Bo Schembechler  is  taking his fourth team to the Rose Bowl and  this 1977 edition, like the other three, has its  own personality.  ""This  is an extremely  tenacious  team,""  says Schembechler. ""This team has overcome  more adversity than any other team I've had  in 25 years of coaching.""  It is a  team that has had to struggle for  success. It is also a  team that has played  brllliantly in games that were of vital im portance.  On  three successive Saturdays Michigan  played undefeated and fifth  ranked Texas  A & M, undefeated Wisconsin and a strong  Michigan State team whose Big Ten sched ule did not include Ohio State. The com bined score  in those  three Wolverine vic tories was Michigan 121, opponents 17.  Defeating Iowa. after a confidence damag ing loss at Minnesota., defeating Purdue on  its grass field after losing there the previous  season, then defeating Ohio State in the Big  Ten and Rose Bowl showdown were all criti cal Saturdays. The road to Pasadena was not  easy for this Wolverine team.  The o1Iense, which was supposed to carry  the load this season as the defensive unit was  being rebuit, was shattered by injuries. The  o1Iensive line from the 1977 Rose Bowl team  had returned intact, but only guard Mark  Donahue and center Walt Downing started  every game. Ta.llback Harlan Huckleby missed  two of the  last six games and played  the  other four at half-speed. A freshman, Stanley  Edwards, started at Purdue. At times there  was no  replacement  for  fullback Russell  Davis,  the  durable  junior who  led  the  Wolverines in rushing with 1013 yards and a.  4.9 average. He was voted the team's most  valuable player.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Rick Leach, also hampered at times by a  heel  injury, kept the o1Iense moving with  1109 yards passing and 13 touchdown passes  that tied a record.  Still, there was an inconsistency that left  the o1Iense suspect and forced the defense to  mature quickly. It was a Michigan defense  that bent, but never broke. It recorded only  one shutout (compared with five by its 1976  predecessor) , but made the big plays when  they were most needed. In the championship  showdown with Ohio State, for example, the  Buckeyes ran 15 plays within the Michigan  20-yard line and gained one net yard, settling  for two field goals.  Ron Simpkins,  a  220-pound  sophomore  who already rates among Michigan's finest  linebackers of the last decade,  led the de fense with a record 158 tackles, 5 fumble re coveries  and  four  pass  deflections. All American outside linebacker John Anderson  and strong safety Dwight Hicks are other key  members of a defense that allowed just 2.6  yards per rush.

411,,95,0.287,1299,30,Mr. COCHRAN of Mississippi.," Mr.  Speaker, it is my sad duty to inform my  colleagues in the House of the death of  Lawrence Russell Ellzey who  formerly  served as a distinguished Member of this  body.  Russell Ellzey was a resident of Jack son, Miss., where he had lived since 1938.  In 1932, he was elected to the House to  fill the unexpired term of the late Percy  Quinn. He was then reelected for a full  term and completed his service in 1935.  Mr. Ellzey had been a  distinguished  citizen before and after his tenure in the  Congress. He was  a  native of Copiah  County, Miss. He served his country in  the Armed Forces in World War I, and  upon his return home he was elected  superintendent of education of Lincoln  County. He organized the first consoli dated school at New Sight in Lincoln  County and was later elected superin tendent of Copiah-Lincoln Agriculture  High School.  He was instrumental in securing junior  college status for what is now Copiah Lincoln Junior College at Wesson, Miss.  Following his service in the House, he  returned to Mississippi where he was en gaged in the life insurance business in  Jackson. Mr. Ellzey had been very active  in the civic and religious life of our com munity. He was a member of the First  Presbyterian Church and was honored  by the Jackson Touchdown Club for his  efforts in promoting outstanding football  players from Mississippi to the Touch down Hall of Fame.  I  take this occasion, Mr. Speaker, to  pay tribute to our former Member and  convey  the regrets and condolences of  this House to his wife, the former Edwina  Short Hagaman, and the other members  of his fine family.  39675  RUBLES THE U.N. CANNOT SPEND  HON. PHILIP M. CRANE  OF U.LINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, December 15, 1977  ",1977
412,,95,0.325,1312,30,Mr. YOUNG of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  recently, my constituent, Mr. Frank A.  Styler brought a St. Petersburg Times ar ticle to my attention. Mr. Styler, who was  a member of the 101st Airborne and at tended the dedication of the 101st Air borne Division Monument at Arlington  National Cemetery on May 29, 1977 was  greatly disappointed by the lack of na tional interest. As a sponsor of the bill to  authorize the erection of this memorial,  I share Mr. Styler's concern. For that  reason,  I  thought  that my colleagues  would appreciate having the opportunity  to review this newspaper article which so  clearly expresses the frustration felt by  many who risked their lives for the free doms that we enjoy today:  WHAT IF You BUILT A BRAND NEW MONUMENT  AND NOBODY SALUTED?  (By Peter B. Gallagher)  The 101st Airborne soldiers are mad. The  ""Battered --- of Bastogne"" are fuming.  There's a  teardrop on the Screaming Eagle's  eye. From the veterans of the first regiment  sent to Normandy in World War II and the  soldiers of the Tet Offensive in Vietnam to  the peacetime warriors at Fort Campbell, Ky.,  the 101st doesn't especially feel like celebrat ing Independence Day today.  A national monument was dedicated to one  of the U.S. Army's top fighting machines a  few weeks ago and nobody cared. The eyes  of the nation looked the other way.  ""We were at the capital. We stood in Ar lington Cemetery and there were 1,500 veter ans of one of the world's greatest fighting  machines and who gave a good g ____ ,"" asks  Gen. Melvin Zais of the 101st, who spoke at  the dedication ceremony. ""This is a sin on  America's conscience.""  Nineteen years of collecting pennies and  dollars from veterans, two congressional bills  and a  year's construction went unnoticed  when the ""Screaming Eagle"" monument was  dedicated at Arlington National Cemetery,  May 29. The fanfare was less than the 101st  expected. The guest list a little short.  There was no network news coverage. Wal ter Cronkite wrote to explain he was turning  the assignment over to the weekend crew. The  event was mentioned with a few paragraphs  in a few newspapers. President Carter sent a  card signed by his director of scheduling.  Fishing with Amy was heavily covered that  day. Hubert Humphrey had a previous com mitment. U.S. Rep. Sam Gibbons from Tampa  (a 101st veteran) had to be in Canada. The  proudest peacetime accomplishment of the  legendary 101st was seemingly ignored.  For Frank ""Sully"" Styler, who was ready to  die at Bastogne, the slight has broken his  heart.  ""Listen,  if it was  just me-no problem.  Maybe it's only interesting to me. But there  are thousands and thousands of us, veterans,  wives, Gold Star mothers ... ,"" says Styler  from his small apartment in Northeast St.  Petersburg. What about all the 101st veterans  in VA hospitals, waiting by  little TV's for  news of  the monument? What about my  buddy in Schenectady that just had his leg  off? He's stm vomiting. Nothing.""  ""The anniversary of Kent State was glori fied  over  this country. But America  said  'Nuts,' to the 101st.""  ""Nuts,'' is probably the most tamous four letter word in military history-the one-word  101st Airborne reply to a Nazi demand for  surrender at Bastogne. It was delivered  to  Hitler's forces which had completely sur rounded the famous Belgian town and were  moving in to annihilate the entire 101st. It  was one of the most dramatic moments of  World War II and forever marked the 101st  Airborne as  the Army's top  fighting unit.  The Dirty Dozen, Battlefield, A Bridge Too  Far-that was the 101st.  ""You have to remember how time dulls the  memory,"" says Gen. Zais, from his Beaufort,  S.C. home.  ""The world was watching  the  101st  in  those days, watching our  every  move.""  He's right. And it adds to the irony of the  whole situation. The winter of 1944 was the  most depressing of WWII. The major action  was centered in Belgium where,  if Hitler's  seven  Panzer  divisions  could  knock  the  Screaming Eagles out of Bastogne, a clear  path would open to the English Channel. The  siege  lasted nearly a month. Supplies were  gone, injuries high and support nowhere in  sight. The Germans were a donut. The Yanks  were the hole.  The media covered Bastogne heavily. It was  filled with the drama of the Alamo and Little  Big Horn. Army headquarters bent regula tions and released the division's name to the  public. Hitler knew  the  foe he had sur rounded. The 101st. The Screaming Eagles.  For days, news of the 101st was the one  encouraging sight which met  the nation's  eyes each morning The Battered --- of  Bastogne. ""Nuts!"" And when Hitler's mighti est push failed, it marked the last major Ger man offensive of the war. The turning point.  Gen.  Eisenhower  fiew  to Mourmelon,  France to award the Distinguished Unit Cita tion to the 101st--the first time in history  an entire division was so honored. From that  day forward recruits were told, ""If you make  the 101st, you are worth any two men."" The  division carries this reputation today.  This is what has the men of Frank Styler's  ilk upset. There is a 21-foot high monument  topped by a bronze eagle dedicated to the  thousands of high-profile 101st soldiers who  marched through Normandy on D-Day, out lasted Hitler at Bastogne, suffered the Viet nam Tet Offensive,  protected  the Ashau  Valley, even helped quell the Detroit riots  when the National Guard faltered ... and  nobody seeins to care. The monument aside  ... have people actually forgotten? It is the  old soldier's greatest fear.  ""There were a half dozen of us that didn't  expect we were going to come out of Bastogne  no way. And we said at the time, if by some  miracle we come out of this, we'd meet next .  Christmas and have a drink together,'' says  Styler, who was awarded two purple hearts  and a pair of bronze stars. ""Well, we came  out of  it, but we  never met. Still every  Christmas Eve since that night I get a bottle  of brandy, sit in my chair all alone and drink  it until I can't do nothin'. Thirty-three years.  And it's the only time I drink whiskey at all.""  Sully Styler knows the other guys are do ing the same thing. He doesn't have to ask.  Such esprit de corps is a major part of the  American mmtary tradition. Reunions, news letters, reliving battles, framed medals, Army  shirt in the closet, remembering the green  of Ireland on the first crossing, general or ders, the taste of K-rations, pride. Somehow,  it has not gone the same for  the Vietnam  veterans and maybe that has something to  do with our present nonconcern for miUtary  monuments. People aren't forgetting. They  just don't want to remember.  ""I was most sad for the Vietnam veterans,""  said Gen. Zais, who gave a rousing speech  attacking  the nation's indifference  toward  its fighting men. ""The Vietnam vet has to  subconsciously  snake  around where  the  World War II vet can brag. Thousands of  these kids, who weren't even born during  Bastogne, performed tremendously in battle,  week after week, month after month slug ging  it out, getting blown up by mines,  fighting a war nobody wanted.  ""This was the first national monument to  soldiers who fought in both wars. All anyone  cared about was the Tomb of the Unknown  Soldier. What about the known soldiers?""  It is a question no one can answer. There  is certainly no acceptable answer for any of  the 101st. What  is  there  to say  to Sully  Styler? It is more than just a monument. It's  a symbol of his life. He was mortared from a  jeep during the war. Dizzy spells came 20  years later. Forced retirement. They gave him  10 per cent disab111ty for an ankle spur. He  paints  apartments  now,  handles  a  101st  newsletter and writes poetry. His medals and  the eagle patch are framed on the wall of his  living room. Purple Heart Magazine is on the  coffee table.  ""Capt. Robert Phillips died a month after  the last reunion and his Wife wrote me and  said, 'You must write a poem for Bob,' sa~  Styler. ""I'll get around to it. I just don't ttel  like writing poems right now.""  NATURALIZATION CEREMONY  HON. PETER W. RODINO, JR.  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, December 15, 1977  ",1977
413,,95,-0.171,1351,30,Mr. HAMILTON.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to insert my Washington report for  December 17,  1977  SIONAL RECORD:  into  the CoNGREs 1978  IssUES FOR  ECONOMIC  Next year will be one of continued eco nomic growth but the rate of that growth  wlll be slower than in 1977. Unemployment  and inflation wlll both remain in the 6-7%  range. Corporate profits will sag a. bit and  the trade deficit will  likely equal the huge  deficit of this year.  These are the economic guesses of the ex perts who testified this fall before the Con gress as they engaged in the annual game of  forecasting the performance of the American  economy. No one can give any assurances that  these guesses wlll be accurate. Past predic tions on  the  infiation  rate,  in particular,  have been notoriously  inaccurate. Despite  differing forecasts, everyone agrees however,  that 1978 wm be a. year of major economic  decisions.  In all likelihood the first decision will in volve the much talked about break between  President Carter and Arthur Burns, chair man of the Federal Reserve System, over the  conduct of monetary pollcy. The President  must decide this month whether he wlll re appoint Chairman Burns for another four year term as chairman. The controversy has  several  facets. President Carter puts con siderable emphasis on economic output and  full  employment while Chairman Burns  tends to put more weight on fighting infla tion. The President  is also concerned with  current policies of the Federal Reserve Board  under which the growth of money supply has  been erratic, often exceeding the target lev els of monetary growth. The Board also has  moved to restrain the money supply at the  same time that interest rates have been ris ing. The relationship between the two men,  the degree of in~ependence of  the Board  from the control of the President, and the  extent of coordination of monetary policy  and fiscal policy are all part of the growing  debate  in the country about our national  monetary policy.  Several weeks ago the President announced  some ambitious goals for  the economy. By  1981 he hopes to reduce the unemployment  rate to 4.75%, the inflation rate to 4.3%, and  to balance the federal budget at a level equal  to 21% of the gross national product. In my  view, worthy as  these goals are,  it  is ex tremely unlikely that they can be obtained  simultaneously. To achieve them the econ omy would have to grow vigorously for five  years, led by a. 10% annual growth in fixed  investment. The need  for  this  investment  raises  another set of major decisions  for  1978: can President Carter create and sustain  the business confidence necessary to obtain  the needed  investment and growth. Such  confidence depends on the President's eco nomic  policies,  especially  those  involving  energy and taxes, and the outlook for busi ness profits. Business  continues  to worry  about where President Carter stands on key  economic  issues and as long as doubt con tinues, confidence w1ll be hard to come by.  The trade deficit, projected to be $30 bil lion  this year,  is a growing economic con cern which may force the country to make  some tough economic decisions in the com ing year.  Its causes are understood-high  energy costs, slow economic growth abroad,  the possible erosion of  the United States  competitive position, sticky exchange rates,  and increased exports from  the developing  countries. The sheer magnitude of the deficit,  however, could limit the conduct of economic  policy for fear of making the trade deficit  even larger.  Next year wlll also bring several major  legislative decisions on economic  issues. If  a satisfactory energy b111  is not passed the  President and  the Congress wm surely be  back at that legislative well once again. At  this moment the push for major tax reform  appears to be fading fast in favor of a sub stantial  tax cut for  individuals and busi nesses and relatively modest and simple taJt  ",1977
414,,95,-0.398,1377,30,Mr. ANNUNZIO.," Mr. Speaker, I would  like to announce the results of a legisla tive poll which I conducted recently to  obtain the opinions of citizens residing  in the 11th Congressional District of Dli nois which I am privileged to represent.  More than 16,000 questionnaires were  completed and returned, and I want to  express my appreciation to my constitu ents who involved themselves in the de cisionmaking process by responding  to  this survey. The large response as well  as the extensive comments sent in sepa rately by so many of the residents of the  Northwest Side of Chicago were encour aging to me as they provided the means  for an exchange of views which I feel is  essential  to maintaining  the strength  and effectiveness of our Government.  Nineteen broad questions were asked  relating  to both domestic and foreign  policy issues, and the responses on the  questionnaires were tabulated entirely by  computer. Before  listing  a  numerical  summary of  the  tabulation, I want to  point out some significant reactions to  several important issues.  The strongest response on the 19 ques tions was on crime, with 97 percent fa voring the imposition of extra penalties  on persons found guilty of committing  crimes with guns or other deadly weap I have sponsored legislation which  imposes a prohibition on possession of  handguns and severely increases prison  t.erms, with absolutely no probation or  QS:(cid:6).  parole permissible for those who commit  felonies with a firearm or other deadly  weapon. My bill will accomplish on the  Federal level what the class X bill seeks  to  accomplish on  the State  level.  I  strongly feel that tougher penalties can  serve as a forceful deterrent to serious  crimes, and therefore, I shall continue to  push for passage of this legislation.  The second strongest response was on  forced busing of schoolchildren, with 88  percent expressing opposition to forced  busing. My own position on this  issue  has been consistently against forced bus ing. Despite the fact that Congress has  voted time and again against forced bus ing, various court decisions have held  that busing  is  constitutional, and  so  forced busing continues. I feel the only  way to resolve the busing question once  and for all is through a constitutional  amendment, and I have sponsored legis lation to provide for such an amend ment.  I was also the first Congressman from  Dlinois  to sign  the discharge petition  that would release this bill providing for  a  constitutional amendment from  the  jurisdicti~n of the Judiciary Committee  and get it to the House fioor for consider ation. A  total of 218  signatures are  needed on the discharge petition in order  to achieve this objective, and currently  about 196 Members have signed. I shall  continue my efforts during the 2d session  of the 95th Congress to secure sutncient  signatures from my colleagues in order  that the House of Representatives may  V{)te on a constitutional amendment to  end forced busing.  A total of 87 percent of those who re sponded indicated support for a $5,000  tax exclusion from gross income for any  amount received as pension or retire ment benefits. I have consistently sup ported a $5,000 tax exclusion for retirees  and was encouraged during  the 94th  Congress when an existing tax credit for  the elderly was increased. However, this  increase did not go far enough, and con sequently, I reintroduced my $5,000 tax  exclusion bill, and I shall continue  to  work for its enactment.  On energy related issues, 11th District  residents favored the continuation of oil  and gas price controls by 74 percent;  supported a tax deduction for insulation  and solar and wind energy equipment by  86 percent;  favored  the use of energy  sources other than natural gas or petro leum by major fuel burning installations  by 78 percent; and opposed the imposi tion of gasoline rationing by 69 percent.  The House  of Representatives  re sponded to these concerns by approving  an omnibus energy bill which imposed a  tax on utility and industrial use of oil  and natural gas in order to encourage  the use of other sources of energy; ex tended natural gas price controls; pro vided tax credits for home insulation;  and rejected a boost in the gasoline tax.  I supported tax credits for home insula tion, extension of natural gas price con trols, a tax on utility and industrial use  of oil and natural gas, and opposed an  increase in the gasoline tax.  The Senate passed an energy bill quite  different from the House bill, and House  and Senate conferees are still trying to  ",1977
