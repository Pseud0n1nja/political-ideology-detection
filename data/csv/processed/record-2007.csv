0,House,110,0.478,9,2007-01-05,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to engage in colloquy  with my friend. I wonder if the gentleman has had an opportunity to look  at what we consider to be the opening-  day rules package that we are considering.  He has talked about, Mr. Speaker,  some very important provisions. I believe  that  the  24-hour  layover  idea  which was propounded by the then-  Members of the minority is an important one. It is not guaranteed here; so  it is not provided.  Number two, if you look at title V of  the measure that is before us, title V  provides 5 minutes of debate on five  closed rules. The Rules Committee will  not even be giving the minority the opportunity to have its amendments defeated in the Rules Committee, and we  are not going through the committee  process at all.  Now,  I will acknowledge that the  items that we are going to be addressing, a majority of which I support, are  very important for us to proceed with,  and an argument has been made that  this was debated and discussed in the  last Congress. Well, look at the tremendous number of new Members of  the House that have come  in, especially on the majority side. They are  denied any opportunity to participate  in this process at all. So as I hear my  friend talk about, yes, we need to proceed in a civil manner, and I am all for  that, I believe we need to proceed with  fairness. I believe these things are all  very important. It is just unfortunate  that the facts are not reflected in the  rhetoric that we are getting on the  need for civility and openness and debate.  If my friend would like to respond, I  would be happy to yield to him.  ",2007
1,House,110,-0.342,9,2007-01-05,Mr. BAIRD.," Mr. Speaker, I would be  happy to respond. And let me say I acknowledge  the  gentleman’s  concern  and I share it to a significant degree.  Personally, I would prefer that there  had been more time and more opportunity  for debate  in  some of  these  measures and more opportunity  for  input from the minority side.  ",2007
2,House,110,-0.434,9,2007-01-05,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 30  seconds to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. BAIRD).  ",2007
3,House,110,0.618,9,2007-01-05,Mr. KING of Iowa.," I thank the gentleman for yielding. I do have to speak  up for Iowa, although I wish Iowa was  playing in the national championships  coming up.  Mr. Speaker, not long ago, Members  and  leaders of the current majority  party of  the House  spent countless  hours attempting to draw the attention of the American people to what  they defined as a culture of corruption  here in Congress. Hoping to use this,  they wanted to turn this phrase, usher  in a new Democratic majority. That  was their wish on election night that  Members of the new majority stood in  this Chamber prior to that, and on numerous soap boxes across the country  and promised that if the American people gave them the chance to run things  here on Capitol Hill, they would do  things differently.  Mr. Speaker,  I agree  that  things  should be done differently here in this  body. Last year in the 109th Congress,  I  introduced H.R. 4967, the Sunlight  Act, and that was of 2006. This bill  would have, on a number of things, required that bills, conference reports,  joint resolutions and amendments be  available to the public on the Internet  in a searchable  format before a bill  could be voted on.  It also would have required and will  require,  if  passed,  privately  funded  travel be approved in advance by the  Rules Committee with the costs being  fully disclosed in 5 days. It would require that Members report exact assets  and liability values on their financial  disclosures  instead of vague  ranges,  vague ranges that allow a Member to  report between $5 million and $25 million  in assets. That  is too broad a  range.  A $20 million range would require the  subject of debate to be projected on the  wall so it is visible to Members and  people that are in the gallery. It would  require  that  donations  to  political  campaigns be reported in a searchable,  sortable  format on the Internet and  have that within the last 30 days each  day, within each 24 hours a report be  filed.  I believe that passage of my Sunlight  Act would do much to raise the levels  of transparency in the affairs of this  body, and  it would also restore the  public’s confidence in our Members. It  is disingenuous for the majority claim  that they want to change things when  they don’t want to give a consideration  of  commonsense  reforms  like  those  outlined in this bill.  Yet this bill, as I worked it hard last  year, could not earn one  signature  from a single Democrat as a co-sponsor. Now, I am refused the opportunity  to even offer this as a bill. This is my  only opportunity to even make the argument.  So I would make this argument, Mr.  Speaker, that there were a lot of campaign promises  that were made.  It  seems to me that the one that is the  most obstructive to all of us is the  promise to accomplish this series of  things in the first 100 hours. The first  100 hours has been redefined. Many of  these promises will be also given up on,  and it will be difficult, and in many  cases, impossible to keep those promises.  Mr. Speaker, why don’t we just waive  this promise of accomplishing all these  things in the first 100 hours so the people of America can be heard on the  floor of the Congress.  ",2007
4,House,110,-0.345,9,2007-01-05,Mr. COURTNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in full support of the civility provisions  offered in part today as one of the new  rules of the 110th Congress. I applaud  the new Democratic leadership for offering this reform package, because our  country needs a fair and functioning  Congress if we are ever going to meet  these huge challenges that we face as a  Nation.

6,House,110,0.556,16,2007-01-05,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY).  ",2007
7,House,110,0.591,16,2007-01-05,Mr. CONAWAY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the ranking member, and I appreciate  the opportunity to talk. I was just trying to clarify a couple of things on the  package to make sure that we understand what it is we are actually doing  to ourselves.  I spent 2 years on the Budget Committee, and it was a very informative  time. I sat through hours and hours of  conversation by my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle touting the virtues of PAYGO and that they thought  this would solve the problems of the  world, knowing all along that their  version of PAYGO that they talked  about was, in fact, a stealth tax increase, given the current Code that we  have in place with respect to the taxes  on capital gains and dividends, as an  example, and the death tax that will  come back in full force in 2011 unless  we actually do something to it.  So as we consider this PAYGO concept, I would  like  for the American  people to know that the devil is in the  details, as with everything that we, in  fact, do.  When I campaigned, when most of my  colleagues  campaigned,  none  of  us  campaigned on increasing deficits. We  all campaigned, on both sides of the  aisle, on reduced spending, on smaller  government, all those kinds of things  that both sides are saying during this  debate today. But I am not sure this  PAYGO version will, in fact, do that.  Also the point we were trying to  check right now, I believe in addition  to the rules included in this rule is a  change in the Rules Committee itself  to allow for votes in the Rules Committee to be not reported out in the  rule. So the Democrat-controlled Rules  Committee can waive this PAYGO rule  and we won’t know which of the members actually voted to do that because  of the way this rule is.  It is interesting yesterday that the  word ‘‘transparent’’ was used often by  the folks on the other side of the aisle,  and yet one of the areas  in which  transparency seems to have been reduced is with respect to the rule that is  included in here with respect to the  Rules Committee.  So with respect to PAYGO, I want  my colleagues and others to know that  this is a stealth tax increase that is  being foisted upon our economy.  ",2007
8,House,110,-0.106,16,2007-01-05,Mr. ELLSWORTH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding time.  I thought I was going to get to follow  a fellow Hoosier, Mr. PENCE, until we  changed the rules. But as a proud member of the Blue Dog Coalition, I am  proud to stand today to voice my support  for restoring the pay-as-you-go  budgeting.  Inclusion of  the PAYGO  provision in the new House rules will  undoubtedly force us to make tough  decisions, but quite frankly we have no  choice. The total National debt is an  astounding $9 trillion, and tough decisions need to be made by Congress. By  restoring PAYGO budgeting, we will  take a positive step toward reducing  and easing the Federal deficit. Hoosier  families in my district make tough decisions every day about how to balance  their budget, and it should be no different from the Congress of the United  States.  Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation  to be  fiscally disciplined  in  implementing pay-as-you-go budgeting, and  this is a great place to start.  ",2007
9,House,110,0.703,16,2007-01-05,Mr. HENSARLING.," Madam Speaker,  I thank the gentleman for yielding, and  I wish to join a number of my colleagues  in  congratulating  the  new  Democrat majority for their work in  the area of earmarks. We know that  earmarks are perhaps a small portion  of spending in this body, but they are a  large portion of the culture of spending. And I certainly salute them for  that work; but, Madam Speaker,  I  must reluctantly oppose this rule because of the so-called PAYGO provision  which has been adequately pointed out  is really a tax-go provision.  If PAYGO  indeed  lived up  to  its  name, it would be worthy of support,  but it is not. I fear that it is nothing  more than false advertising. I listened  very carefully to our new Speaker yesterday when I believe she said that  there would be no new deficit spending  under the watch of the Democrat majority. But as I look at this so-called  PAYGO provision, I see nothing that  deals with entitlement spending, which  threatens to bankrupt future generations,  our  children  and  our  grandchildren, with either massive debt or a  massive tax increase.  Over half of our budget deals with entitlement spending. There is nothing  that deals with that. It doesn’t deal  with baseline budgeting. Now, most  Americans don’t know what that is, it  is inside baseball, but it is an accounting concept that would make an Enron  accountant blush. It puts in automatic  inflation for government programs, yet  we don’t call it new spending. And yet  there  is  nothing  in  this  so-called  PAYGO provision dealing with that.  And we don’t even have a statute.  It is also false advertising, Madam  Speaker, because it doesn’t live up to  what the Democratic majority advocated when they were in the minority.  We have a rule; we don’t have a statute, the rule that will end up being  waivable. We don’t have the sequester  mechanism of earlier PAYGO. We don’t  have  the wedding with  the  discretionary caps that we had. And, indeed,  what we have  is a subterfuge here.  What we have is a Trojan horse for  more tax increases on small businesses  and American families that threaten  the jobs of Americans, and we must  vote this down.  ",2007

13,House,110,-0.538,23,2007-01-05,Mr. MCGOVERN.," No, I will not. We  sometimes report and file a special rule  late one night, and the next morning  the rule and the bill are on the House  floor. There is just not much room for  even minor clerical errors when you  are under such tight deadlines. This  rules change does not mean that the  public will have any less access to what  happens  in  the  Rules  Committee,  Madam Speaker.  We plan to include record votes in  the Rules Committee reports and, even  better, we intend to post committee  votes on the Rules Committee Web site  as soon as they have them, so that the  American people will know what  is  going on.  Even better than that, we plan to  have more meetings during the daylight hours so that the public and the  press know what we are doing in the  Rules Committee.  Well, let me say to my friends on the  other side of the aisle, if you feel that  the votes taken  in the Rules Committee are not being made public fast  enough, or are clear enough, you have  my word that we will work to fix it,  and we will work with you. You have  my word on that.  More importantly, Madam Speaker,  after our business here in the House  concludes today, we will have made  historic progress. We will have ended  the  culture of  corruption  that has  plagued this House for the past dozen  years. We will have paved the way to  accomplishing what the American people voted for, to give minimum wage  workers a raise.  Right now the average CEO of a Fortune 500 Company earns $10,712  in 1  hour 16 minutes. It takes an average  minimum wage worker  52,  40-hour  weeks, an entire year, to earn the same  $10,712. It is wrong, and we are going to  fix it.  We will have paved a way to make  college tuition and prescription drugs  more affordable, to make our homeland  safer, by implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and to invest in lifesaving stem cell research.  All of these measures, Madam Speaker,  have been  the  subject of hearings.  Many of them have been voted on. But  the majority on the other side has  stalled and undermined these measure  at every step. No more.  Finally, Madam Speaker, let me assure my friends, including the distinguished gentleman from Florida, that  we will conduct the business of this  House in a much more fair, civil and  open way than has been the norm of  the last 12 years. Your views will be  heard more than ours were. Your ideas  will be given more consideration than  ours were. Your voices will be more respected than ours were, because that is  the  right way  to  run  the people’s  House.  ",2007
14,House,110,0.561,23,2007-01-05,Mr. GINGREY.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in opposition to Title V of H. Res. 6 and encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this  measure.  Since the election we have heard promises  of grandeur from the new Democrat majority.  They have promised to usher in a new era of  civility, bi-partisanship, and cooperation  into  the halls of Congress. They have repeatedly  stated that the American people want a civilized tone in Washington. But it appears the  Democrats are ignoring their own message.  In the opening hours of this Congress, with  their very first piece of business, the Democrats have put forth a resolution that is the opposite of civility and transparency—indeed, a  total contradiction of the way they pledged to  conduct business. For the first time in the history of this body, Madam Speaker, the Democrats have included closed rules governing future debate in the House rules package, and  have even gone so far as to prevent the Rules  Committee  from meeting  to deliberate  these  rules or the larger rules package.  But they did not stop there, Madam Speaker. After promising an open and fair process,  the Democrats have allowed just 10 minutes  of debate—that’s 5 minutes per side—on Title  V of this resolution.  This is no small measure, Madam Speaker.  Included in Title V are closed rules governing  debate  on  stem-cell  research,  the  recommendations of  the 9/11 commission,  the  cost of prescription drugs, and the federal minimum wage. Certainly  the American people  expect a debate of ideas and the proper congressional process for some of the most important issues facing our Nation. Instead, the  Democrats will deliver 10 minutes of debate.  Further Madam Speaker, Title V of this resolution will prevent  the votes of  the Rules  Committee from being made public. A veil of  secrecy will  fall over  this critical committee  they now control. This is not the transparency  and accountability in our political process the  Democrats have promised.  So, Madam Speaker,  it appears  the new  age of the Democrat majority will unfortunately  not live up to its much-hyped billing. Instead of  more openness,  fairness, and  transparency,  the Democrats have revealed the hypocritical  nature of  their disingenuous promises with  their very first piece of legislation. Reneging  on  their campaign promises  in  the opening  hours of this session is no way to build the  spirit of trust and cooperation across the aisle.  Madam Speaker, I hope for the sake of the  American people that the Democrats start adhering to their pre-election rhetoric and conduct the business of this body in a civilized  manner.  ",2007
15,House,110,-0.606,23,2007-01-05,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today  in support of H. Res. 6,  the House  Rules Package for the 110th Congress. With  the passage of this resolution, we are committing ourselves to restore honest leadership, civility, and  fiscal  responsibility  to  the U.S.  House of Representatives. It is a commitment  that we owe to our constituents and to our Nation.  Unfortunately, over the past several years,  the House  of Representatives was  transformed from the people’s House into a legislative body where  those who could afford  to  make  their  influence  felt  far  too often held  sway. Legislation was enacted that benefited  the wealthy few instead of the vast majority.  Legislation was enacted—often in the middle  of the night—without time for review or careful  consideration. Legislation was enacted to benefit those who could afford to pay for fancy  meals and golf vacations while legislation that  would improve wages and the quality of life for  working Americans was ignored. The process  was  abused,  votes were  held  open,  and  amendments were prohibited  from being offered. The  losers have been  the American  public.  Perhaps the single best example of these  abuses is the Medicare Modernization Act, a  law which actually prohibits Medicare from negotiating for drug savings, as the VA and large  employers do today, and by doing so guarantees that senior citizens and persons with disabilities will pay more than they should for the  drugs that they need. This law would not have  been enacted  if pharmaceutical companies  had not been allowed to use undue influence,  if Democratic conferees had not been locked  out of  the negotiations,  if Members had not  been intimidated on the House floor, and if the  final vote had not been held open for nearly 3  hours to change the outcome.  During the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress, we will eliminate this prohibition and require that Medicare use its bargaining clout on  behalf of consumers. Today, we are  taking  steps to make sure that the procedural abuses  that were used  to enact  that prohibition will  become a relic of the past.  We also begin the 110th Congress by putting our financial house in order. The past 6  years of fiscal mismanagement has turned a  $5.6 trillion surplus into an over $3 trillion deficit. The passage of H. Res. 6 will help us get  our current debt and financial crisis under control while allowing us to make the investments  needed  for American  families and our economic future.  With the restoration of pay-as-you-go budgeting, Congress will not be able to increase  the deficit and make  future generations of  Americans carry a debt load so that today’s  wealthy can get tax cuts like the ones passed  over the past few years. According to the non-  partisan Congressional Budget Office,  those  tax cuts, which primarily benefit the very rich,  are the main cause of our country’s fiscal reversal. Reining in the spiraling debt will give  us a chance to invest in our communities, create jobs, provide retirement security, and stimulate our economy.  Transparency requirements for earmarks will  also help us make certain that taxpayers’ dollars are put  to good use while eliminating  wasteful spending. I believe that district-specific earmarks on appropriations or other legislation should not be provided unless they directly improve our communities. Requiring better disclosure of sponsorship of earmarks and  ensuring  that Members have no personal  financial  interest  in  the  request will help us  guarantee that the funding is targeted to essential  infrastructure  improvements, community development, vital research, and other important programs. Congress has a long history  of providing earmarks for such projects, and I  support their continued funding and eliminating  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:37 Jan 06, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K05JA7.040 H05JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007

18,House,110,0.593,30,2007-01-05,Mr. POE.," Mr. Speaker, ‘‘To be born  free is an accident, to live free is a  privilege, and to die free is a responsibility.’’ Powerful words  spoken  by  Brigadier General James Sehorn that  are embedded into the minds of our  valiant  soldiers  protecting  nations  from a cowardly enemy that burrows  beneath the Iraqi desert sands, those  individuals that seek to annihilate our  freedoms that all people should have.  The American  soldier  believes  in  freedom more  than any other  individual on Earth because they witness  the inhumanity of tyranny. They see it  in the fierce trenches of battle. Our soldiers secure life and liberty, and they  give it to those folks in Afghanistan  and Iraq.  U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Edward  Charles Reynolds, Jr. was one of these  soldiers. He was an 8-year Army veteran. Staff Sergeant Reynolds had been  stationed among the terrorist Iraqi insurgents, fighting against them to ensure a free nation of Iraq.  He is a native of Port Arthur, Texas,  and he was a 1997 graduate of Thomas  Jefferson High School, where he was a  star tight-end and middle linebacker  on the football team. As a Texan, Staff  Sergeant Reynolds spent fall football  seasons cheering for one of the greatest  teams in college football, the University of Texas Longhorns. Those who  knew him knew a man who took care  of others, whether it be his family, his  friends, or his country. Staff Sergeant  Reynolds was their protector.  Family was  the most  important  thing to Staff Sergeant Reynolds. He  was a devoted father to his children,  two daughters and a son. He was dedicated to his fiancee. He was the guardian of his older sister. Friends knew  him as the man that kept them out of  trouble, pushing them to succeed  in  life. And his country knew him as a defender of our freedoms.  In December  2005, Staff Sergeant  Reynolds was deployed to Iraq, worlds  away, but he remained a constant presence in the life of his family and all of  his friends. He sent out cards and letters, constantly reminding his fiancee  of their New Year’s Eve wedding date.  During the next 10 months, assigned to  the U.S. Army  1st Battalion,  67th  Armor Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, Staff Sergeant Reynolds dodged bullets, IEDs, and Iraqi  outlaws  throughout  the  Baghdad  desert.  But on September 26,  less than 2  months from coming home to Texas,  Staff Sergeant Reynolds and a fellow  soldier were crossing a Baghdad bridge  in a military convoy when that bridge  collapsed, plunging their vehicle underwater, trapping both soldiers inside. 27-  year-old Staff Sergeant Reynolds and  his colleague were killed in action, becoming victims  in  the  struggle  for  Iraqi freedom.  A decorated soldier, Staff Sergeant  Reynolds was the recipient of the Combat Infantry Badge, the Kosovo Campaign Medal. He was also awarded the  Iraqi Combat Campaign Medal,  the  Global War  on  Terrorism  Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Bronze  Star. He was a lifelong member of the  Borden  Chapel Missionary  Baptist  Church. And like his mother and father, Staff Sergeant Reynolds had a devout faith in his Almighty God, believing that everything he was given was a  gift by Him.  On October 7, the Borden Chapel Missionary Baptist Church in Beaumont,  Texas, and the Reverend Airon Reynolds, Jr., gave this brave soldier a  hero’s memorial  and  homecoming.  Family and friends were not the only  ones who memorialized and honored  Staff Sergeant Reynolds. The Patriot  Guard Riders and the Southeast Texas  Veterans Service thanked him for his  valor. More than 200 Patriot Guard  Riders, with  flags of tribute raised,  stood in honor of Staff Sergeant Reynolds, the son of Texas, an American  soldier, as he reached his eternal resting place.  Mr. Speaker, I have a photograph of  Sergeant Reynolds, the way that he  was when he was protecting freedom  across the desert sands of Iraq. American citizens are born into the privilege  of  freedom, and we must remember  that the sacrifice given by Staff Sergeant Reynolds and all American warriors  is responsible  for the continuation of this great Nation.  Staff Sergeant Reynolds  chose  to  protect the freedom that he was born  into from the violent militants robbing  nations of life and liberty. So God bless  Staff Sergeant Reynolds and his family.  In the words of George Orwell: ‘‘We  sleep safely in our beds because rough  men stand ready in the night to visit  violence on those who would do us  harm.’’  And that’s just the way it is.  f  ",2007

Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this  afternoon to congratulate the Rutgers  Scarlet Knights on their recent victory  over Kansas State in the Texas Bowl.

Running back Ray Rice led the winning effort with 170 yards rushing and a  touchdown. Wide receiver Tim Brown  scored two touchdowns, which, combined with Rutgers’ stifling defense,  was more than enough to put away  Kansas State. The defense held Kansas  State under 200 total yards and did not  allow an offensive touchdown.

20,House,110,0.47,37,2007-01-05,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I came to  the floor to talk a little bit about national security and where the Nation’s  defense apparatus stands as of now. But  I thought I also might comment on the  comments that were made by two of  my wonderful colleagues, Ms. WOOLSEY  of California and Mr. PAUL of Texas,  who preceded me and commented about  their position to the effect that we  should bring our troops home immediately from Iraq. And implicit in their  comments was the message that somehow Saddam Hussein’s continued rule  of Iraq would have been preferable to  the American intervention.  I disagree with that theme, and let  me tell you why. In listening to Ms.  WOOLSEY talk about the wounded, the  KIA, the suffering in that part of the  world, and the burden that has been  borne by American soldiers, I think it  is also important to remember the Iraq  that was represented by Saddam Hussein.  And while she has, obviously, the images that have compelled her to take  her philosophical position, the image  that I have, and I keep in my desk  drawer, is the photograph of the hundreds of mothers whose bodies are  strewn across the hillside in northern  Iraq, holding their children, some of  them newborn babies, some of them  four, five, 6 years old, dead in mid-  stride where they were hit by poison  chemical, poison chemical that was delivered into those villages at the order  of Saddam Hussein.  And I have taken, as a guy who sometimes watches the History Channel, to  tuning in when I see the History Channel reviewing the exhuming of bodies  in these mass graves and putting together this story, this mosaic of Iraq  history under Saddam Hussein and the  story of how hundreds of people, men,  women and children, would be herded  across fields and they would be executed and their bodies would be pushed  into mass graves. And now we are uncovering those mass graves.  And just like the mass graves that  we found in Europe, especially those  that were filled by bodies that had been  people who had been executed by the  Nazis, there are more people now in  those mass graves, we find, than what  we had projected.  And as I watched the exhuming of  some of those bodies on the History  Channel, I noticed that the anthropologist who was doing the particular work  noted that the mother, in some cases,  who was executed would often have a  .45 bullet hole in the back of her head,  and her small baby that she was holding would also have a bullet hole in the  back of his or her head. So the monstrosity that was Saddam Hussein, the  mass execution, the killing of people  with chemical weapons,  is what the  American  troops displaced when we  moved into Iraq.  Now, it is tough to stand up a free  nation and stand up a military that is  able to protect it, but that is the challenge that we are meeting right now.  And we are following the same basic  pattern that we have followed for 60  years. Whether you are talking about  Japan or the Philippines or El Salvador  in our own hemisphere, first you stand  up a free government. Secondly, you  stand up a military that is capable of  protecting that free government, and  third,  the Americans, not  coveting  anything that that country has, the  Americans leave.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I thought I also  might speak just a little bit, as we turn  over the control of Congress to the  Democrat leadership, not only in the  full House, but also  the committee  chairmanships, and my own committee  chairmanship  now  has  been  relinquished to the gentleman  from Missouri, IKESKELTON, my good friend and  a wonderful person and a person with a  real heart  for the troops. I thought  that  I might  just  comment  about  where we stand right now. I think it is  important for the American people to  know where we stand and what this  Congress that is going out has accomplished for national security.  First, what have we done  for the  troops? Well, over the last 8 years we  have increased the pay for the Army,  the Air Force, the Navy, the Marines,  and the National Guard by right at 40  percent, a 40 percent pay increase. We  have increased family separation pay,  the amount of money that we deliver  to our military families when they are  separated when people are deployed  overseas. We have increased that from  $100 a month to about $250 a month. We  have increased our combat pay.  Mr. Speaker, I know I have only got  5 minutes, so I will elaborate on some  of the accomplishments that occurred  during this last Congress in the next  hour.  DEFINING EARMARKS  ",2007
21,,110,-0.556,72,2007-01-05,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker, I, along  with my colleague Congressman MIKETHOMPSON, rise today to honor Ben Stone, who recently completed 20 years of service as head  of  the Sonoma County Economic Development Board. Under Ben’s quiet but dynamic  leadership, the Economic Development Board  (EDB) has successfully implemented programs  that have more than met the mandate of the  County Board of Supervisors to enhance economic development by concentrating on new  and  innovative programs  that enable businesses  to remain competitive  in a changing  economy.  Ben came to Sonoma County from the Seattle area where he had been a county administrator  in Port Angeles, Washington, a consultant with Arthur Andersen & Co. and a Special Projects Director with Scafco Corporation.  He graduated from Whitman College in Walla  Walla and received his masters of Public Administration from the University of Washington  in Seattle.  Ben  tells  the story  that, after coming  to  Sonoma County, he was informed that a decision had been made to close the EDB. However, he commenced creating programs atypical of economic development, which bolstered  the  local economy, and, 20 years  later,  the  EDB is thriving under his leadership.  With the help of a small staff and interns,  Ben has developed a number of award-winning programs in concert with local private and  public sectors. Many of these programs have  been successfully transitioned to community-  based organizations.  Among them are the Sonoma County Tourism Program, which served to increase tourism  31  percent;  two  technology  groups  (SofTech, a trade group, and the North Bay  Techonology Roundtable,  a  policy  group);  Youth Business Week; the Business Environmental Alliance;  the North Bay WorId Trade  Association;  the Small Business Center now  operated by Santa Rosa Junior College; a  home-based business project; and a business  crime prevention program. Ben’s office still operates the Sonoma County Film Commission.  Ben also  initiated a broad-based strategic  planning process resulting in the formation of  bachelors and master’s degree programs  in  Engineering Science at Sonoma State University, a new cooperative agricultural marketing  program, and an economic research program.  An EDB  forum,  the Business Regulatory  Roundtable,  involving elected officials,  regulatory agencies, and business executives  to  improve local regulatory processes, resulted in  Northern California’s first multi-agency Permit  Assistance Center.  By  creating  the Economic Development  Board Foundation, the EDB is able to support  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:33 Jan 06, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A04JA8.022 E05JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 5 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2007
22,,110,0.426,79,2007-01-05,Mr. TERRY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of the Calling for 2–1–1 Act of  2007. I am proud to lend my support as an  original cosponsor of this bill, which was introduced today by my colleague, Ms. ESHOOof  California. I would also like to note a concern  I have with the bill as introduced, which I hope  will be  resolved prior  to a vote  in  the  full  House of Representatives.  2–1–1 is the number designated by the Federal Communications Commission  to provide  citizens with information and referral about important community services and volunteer opportunities. United Way and its affiliates operate more than 200 call centers in 41 states  nationwide,  including my home state of Nebraska. About two-thirds of American citizens  currently have access to 2–1–1 referrals. The  Calling for 2–1–1 Act will help achieve nationwide coverage for all citizens.  More than 50 percent of the calls made to  2–1–1 call centers are placed to meet basic  needs such as food, heat, clothing and shelter  for citizens  facing difficulty. 2–1–1 helps  to  keep citizens off long-term government financial aid such as welfare and food stamps by  meeting immediate needs before they become  crises. 2–1–1 also enhances homeland security by serving as an emergency backup to 9–  1–1 during natural disasters and other crises.  In my Congressional District alone, almost  40,000  Nebraskans  sought  information  through 2–1–1 between November 2005 and  October 2006. The top needs were for assistance with utilities, rent, food, housing, health  and dental care, furniture and tax preparation.  Thousands of Nebraskans were able to obtain  assistance from federal and non-profit community service agencies because of the existence  of 2–1–1.  2–1–1 was crucial during the aftermath of  Hurricane Katrina. When 9–1–1 emergency  lines were inoperational, 2–1–1 stepped up to  link citizens in dire need with critical services,  including emergency medical care,  food and  housing, and crisis  recovery and  relocation  services nationwide. Volunteer organizations  such as the Red Cross also benefit from people who call 2–1–1 seeking opportunities  to  give back to their communities. 2–1–1 meets  critical needs and merits federal aid, provided  that additional protections are put in place before this legislation is brought to a vote.  It was my privilege to work last year with  Ms. ESHOOand Mrs. CLINTON in the Senate,  as well as Mr. PICKERINGand Mr. BILIRAKIS in  the House of Representatives, to address important concerns for ‘‘socially sensitive’’ referrals before bringing the Calling for 2–1–1 Act  to a vote. As Members of Congress with deep  convictions for the protection of human life, we  drafted language to refer callers seeking pregnancy-related services to public health departments.  This reasonable compromise was designed  to ensure the 2–1–1 legislation does not become a vehicle for taxpayer funding of controversial referrals such as abortion. Unfortunately,  this  important  language, which had  been agreed upon by all parties, was not included  in  the  legislation  introduced  today.  I  look forward to working with my Ms. ESHOO  and my other colleagues to correct this situation.  If my concerns are not addressed, I would  be  forced  to vote against and actively  fight  against the legislation I have cosponsored and  worked to enact into law, despite my strong  support  for  increasing access  to 2–1–1  for  more American citizens. The fact that I have  again cosponsored this legislation despite my  concern is testament to the good working relationship I have enjoyed with Ms. ESHOOand  Ms. CLINTON, and which I trust will continue  during this new Congress.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I look forward  to working with my colleagues on  the other  side of  the aisle  to help  this  legislation become law while ensuring it protects and upholds the sanctity of human life.  f  IN HONOR OF UNIVERSITY PARK  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  HON.

To commemorate this special occasion, Peoples Bank will hold an anniversary  celebration on Saturday, January 6, 2007, at  the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in  Munster, Indiana.  Peoples Bank was established in 1910 and  was organized with a focus to meet the many  needs of  its consumers. Peoples Bank was  originally known as  the First Polish National  Building and Loan Association. During  that  time, it was the main hub for church and social activities in East Chicago, Indiana.

26,,110,0.453,86,2007-01-05,Mr. MICA.," Madam Speaker, with the passing of President Gerald Ford our Nation, the  U.S. House of Representatives and the Ford  Family have  lost a  leader, a respected colleague and a loved one who was very special  to their lives.  Few American  leaders of our  time have  gained the admiration and appreciation so well  deserved and earned by our 38th President.  While our country has  lost a distinguished  leader and  the Congress has  lost a distinguished Member, Gerald Ford’s life and public  service will always remain a model for future  generations.  In October of 1999, I had the pleasure to  quietly sit and speak with President Ford at  the conclusion of a Capitol Hill reception that  was held after he was honored with the Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda.  While I had met him before, what struck me  on this special occasion was how such a great  man receiving the highest honor from our Nation and Congress could be so humble, so  gracious and so genuine.  How memorable it was for me to spend that  special  time with  that gentle man and great  American. How fitting it was that Gerald Ford  returned this week to the Capitol and the Congress he loved. While this gentle man belongs  to  the ages, he will always share a special  place in our hearts and fond memories.  f  TRIBUTE TO JOHN ABIJAH DAVIS  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 4, 2007  ",2007
27,,110,-0.379,86,2007-01-05,Mr. HOYER.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to mark an important milestone in the life of  one of my  fellow Marylanders—John Abijah  Davis—who today celebrates his 100th birthday.  John Abijah Davis was born January 4,  1907 in an upstairs bedroom of his parent’s  house on North Sherman Drive  in  Indianapolis, Indiana—a home built by his Uncle, Issac  Davis. Named  after  another Uncle,  John  Davis, and his father, Abijah Alley Davis, John  A. Davis grew up in that home, attending St.  Phillip Neri school and parish, before moving  on  to Cathedral High School  in 1920, graduating in 1924 with the first full four-year class  in school history.  John Davis graduated from the University of  Notre Dame in 1928 with a BA in English. At  school, he counted among his friends Walter  ‘‘Red’’ Smith,  later a Pulitzer Prize winning  sports columnist for the New York Times, Miller Brewing Company heir Fred Miller and  Howard Phelan, who later in life donated the  famous ‘‘Touchdown Jesus’’ mural that adorns  the  facade of  the school  library overlooking  the football stadium.  In 1934, John A. Davis married Virginia  Lyon in Notre Dame’s historic Log Chapel in  a mass presided over by his cousin, Rev.  John O’Hara, then president of Notre Dame.  In 1936, John and Virginia had a daughter,  Mary Elizabeth Davis.  Moving  from  Indiana  to New York, John  Davis joined his brother Charles and opened  the Browne-Davis Furniture Co. The business  prospered and both became treasured members of the local community in Oswego. Selling  their successful business after 40-plus  years, the Davis brothers enjoyed a fulfilling  retirement.  John briefly became a constituent of mine  when he retired to Dameron, Maryland to live  with his daughter Mary Elizabeth. Following  her death in 2001, John moved to Cheverly,  Maryland,  residing with his grandson, John  Davis Porcari, and his wife and five children.  John Porcari served with great distinction as  Maryland Secretary of Transportation under  Governor Parris Glendening. He has recently  been  selected  by  Governor-elect  Martin  O’Malley to take on this position in his administration.  John Davis heads a family consisting of four  grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and two  great-great grandchildren. Dozens of nieces  and  nephews  from  four  generations  and  scores of friends continue to look up to Mr.  Davis,  including his grand-nephew, Lt. Col.  Harold VanOpdorp, USMC, who commands  the First Battalion, 24th Marine Regiment  in  Anbar Province, Iraq.  According to his family, John Abijah Davis  continues  to  teach  life’s most valuable  lessons—humility, duty and hard work, devotion  to one’s God, family and friends. These lessons are reflected in all those he has touched.  As he, his  family and  friends celebrate  this  milestone, they celebrate not the chronology  of years, but the character of the man.  I  join with his  family and many  friends  in  wishing him continued health and happiness  on his 100th birthday.  f  RECOGNIZING CHAD BRENTON FOR  ACHIEVING THE RANK OF EAGLE  SCOUT  HON.

28,,110,-0.606,93,2007-01-05,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Madam Speaker, New  Year’s Eve marked another grave milestone in  Iraq, as the United States lost its 3,000th soldier since  the war began. Attacks on our  troops are  increasing as civil war spreads.  America lost more troops in Iraq in December  than in any other month during the previous  two years.  As we honor the fallen, we must remember  the daily  life and death  consequences of  President Bush’s policies. The time to begin  withdrawing our  troops  from  Iraq has  long  since passed. The longer we have stayed the  course, the worse conditions in Iraq have become.  November’s elections were a mandate  for  change in Iraq. As more and more members  of the President’s own party deem the Administration’s policy a  failure, an overwhelming  majority of Americans are calling on President  Bush  to draw down our  troops  from  Iraq.  It  has become resoundingly clear that a military  solution is not possible. Our troops were not  trained for or sent to Iraq to referee a civil war.  An extended American military presence will  just continue to fuel the insurgency.  The Republican co-chair of the Iraq Study  Group, James Baker, warned  that  ‘‘We no  longer can afford to stay the course,’’ and Lee  Hamilton,  the Democratic  co-chair, agreed.  ‘‘The current approach is not working and the  ability of the United States to influence events  is diminishing. Our ship of state has hit rough  waters. It must now chart a new way forward.’’  Instead of continuing to stubbornly defend his  administration’s  failed  war  strategies,  the  President must now work with Congress and  foreign leaders to chart a diplomatic strategy  that reduces the violence in Iraq.  The President left the U.S. with no good options, but increasing the number of American  servicemen and women  in  Iraq  is an unacceptable course. The new Congress must use  its authority  to ensure  that  the calls of  the  American people do not fall on deaf ears.  It will take many years for the U.S. to move  beyond the setbacks we have suffered in Iraq.  Our military  is overstretched. Our diplomatic  authority has been severely diminished. We  have shifted our focus away from Afghanistan,  and a resurgent Taliban is increasing its attacks on American troops.  For those families whose sons and daughters died  in  the war,  the wounds will never  heal.  Illinois  is one of eight states  that  lost  more than 100 troops in Iraq. From Rock Island  to  Champaign,  from  Skokie  to  Carbondale, more than 100 families have suffered  the ultimate  loss.  It  is  time  to change  course.  f  RECOGNIZING  KENNETH  G.

29,,110,0.332,93,2007-01-05,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today to pay tribute to an exceptional  Kentuckian, Mayor Charles  ‘‘Charlie’’ Beach  III. After serving 32 years as mayor of the City  of Beattyville, Kentucky, Mayor Beach is leaving office. I want to express my deepest gratitude for his many contributions and years of  public service.  Throughout his  tenure, Mayor Beach has  led a number of initiatives to improve the lives  of Lee County residents, build hope in our Appalachian region, and serve as an economic  and community development leader for the entire Commonwealth. Southern and Eastern  Kentucky has been plagued with inadequate  water and sewer infrastructure and poor housing opportunities. Mayor Beach has been the  driving force behind construction of two water  plants, a sewage treatment plant, and installation of necessary piping to serve and reach  the  rural  residents of Beattyville and Lee  County. In addition, Mayor Beach is well-regarded throughout the Commonwealth for his  vision of providing quality, affordable housing.  Since 2002, Mayor Beach has been a critical partner in our regional anti-drug initiative  ‘‘Operation UNITE.’’ Beach was a key early  supporter and critical ally in getting drugs off  our streets and cleaning up our communities.  He has consistently backed efforts to educate  our children on the dangers of drug use and  our program to help drug users find treatment  options.  In addition to his duties as mayor, Charles  Beach is also the Vice-Chairman of the Peoples Exchange Bank where he provides business development and public relations leadership. He is the former President of the Kentucky League of Cities and has served as the  Chairman of the Kentucky River Area Development District. These organizations promote  the welfare and economic growth of Kentucky’s rural and urban areas.  Madam Speaker,  I want  to  thank Mayor  Beach for his selfless sacrifice and service on  behalf of the people of the City of Beattyville,  Lee County, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. His dedication and integrity are an inspiration to us all and I know his contributions  will live on for many years to come.

David was  the North  American Executive Engineer  for Advanced  Technology Vehicles at Toyota, whose headquarters  is  located  in my congressional district.  Although most Americans may not know his  name, David Hermance was one of the most  influential engineers and environmentalists in  the country. He was only 59 years-old when  the  experimental  aircraft  he was  piloting  crashed into the Pacific Ocean, and his tragic  death is a stunning loss not only for his family,  but for the larger community he served.  Equally respected in the environmental community and the automotive industry, David was  known  as  the  ‘‘Father  of  the  American  Prius’’—and for good reason. He had a knack  for  translating  complex  systems and  technologies  into  easy-to-understand  concepts,  and he worked tirelessly to help lay-people understand the workings and benefits of hybrid  and other advanced-technology vehicles.  It was David’s passionate approach and  commitment  to  the environment  that helped  persuade a skeptical industry and auto-buying  public to appreciate the enormous potential of  his work. In fact, Madam Speaker, my family  drives two hybrid vehicles—one in California  and the other in Washington, DC.  David will be sorely missed—as an outstanding individual and beloved colleague. Our  thoughts and prayers are with his family: his  wife Mary, his children Keith and Kathy, his  grandson Colin and sister Bonnie.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE IMPACT  AID SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION BILL  HON.

31,House,110,-0.508,5,2007-01-17,Ms. SOLIS.," Mr. Speaker, today I rise  to congratulate America Ferrera  for  winning the Golden Globe for best actress  in a comedy  for her work  in  ABC’s television show  ‘‘Ugly Betty.’’  America Ferrera is a native of Los Angeles, the daughter of Honduran immigrant parents and a student at the University of Southern California, earning  a degree in international relations.  As Betty Suarez, her character  in  ‘‘Ugly Betty,’’ Ferrera plays a smart,  young Latina  professional  breaking  into the publishing world. The people  we see  in here on television and  in  movies have a great influence on our  communities  and  the  attitudes  of  Americans.  While 40 percent of American youth  ages 19 and under are children of color,  few of the faces that they see on television actually reflect those races and  cultures.  Through  her  work, Ms.  Ferrera is breaking down barriers for  Latinos and Latinas in prime-time television.  I commend America Ferrera and everyone involved in Ugly Betty for helping to break down the stereotypes and  provide a role model for young Latinas.  I hope we can work together to teach  everyone to appreciate diversity in our  country.  Congratulations, America Ferrera.  f  CONGRATULATING THE CITIES OF  NORFOLK, VIRGINIA BEACH, AND  PORTSMOUTH, VIRGINIA  (Mrs. DRAKE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

This is the first complex in the Nation that is financed and  supported by more than one city. This  complex will serve over 60 adults from  our region who formerly lived in shelters, under bridges or on the street.  Congratulations to these three cities  who worked regionally and who worked  together  to address  the very basic  human need for shelter and providing  other comprehensive services such as  job  counseling, mental health,  substance abuse and drug-abuse treatment  as well. Congratulations to them, and  we hope other regions of the country  will follow their example, and they will  be a great model for our Nation.  f  COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT  OF 2007  (Mr. KLEIN of Florida asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2007
33,House,110,-0.265,5,2007-01-17,Mr. KLEIN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  the health of the American economy  depends on having a highly educated  skilled workforce, but studies show the  number one reason that students fail  to attend college today is cost.  In addition to tuition, fees, interest  rates on student loans have also risen.  Over the last 5 years the interest rates  on student loans have jumped by almost 2 percentage points, further increasing the cost of college. Many of us  were dependent on student loans to go  to college in the first place. I am one of  them.  Recently, when  I visited Pompano  High School in my district, I met many  exceptional  students who were concerned that they would have difficulty  managing tuition costs. These students  in Pompano High School deserve better, as students do all over the United  States. This Democrat bill would cut  the interest rate in half from the current 6.8 percentage to 3.4 percent over  the next 5 years.  This proposal will help over 5.5 million low- and middle-income students  and their families afford a college education and a way to a better life. As a  case in point, a study this year by the  U.S. Public Interest Research Group  estimates the average cost for a Florida student, what it will save over the  cost of its life is $4,400. That is a powerful incentive, and I ask everyone to  join us in passing this legislation.  f  AGAINST NEW IRAQ POLICY  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)  ",2007
34,House,110,-0.469,5,2007-01-17,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  last week  something  very  disturbing occurred. President Bush had  an opportunity to demonstrate that he  understood the country’s concern, he  had a chance to finally articulate a  clear plan  for our country’s engagement in Iraq. But, instead, the President chose to escalate our involvement  in Iraq’s civil war by proposing a substantial  increase  in  the number of  American troops there, about half of  whom are based in Georgia.  Mr. Speaker, our troops have performed with great courage. They have  performed admirably in the Congress,  and the American people will continue  to support them and provide them with  every resource that they need. But we  need better leadership coming from the  President and his War Cabinet. This  new Democratic Congress is not going  to give the President a blank check,  and we will continue to demand answers to the tough questions that have  not been answered.  Rather than escalating our involvement in Iraq, I believe that any plan  should focus on shifting responsibility  to the Iraqis so that we can begin a  phased  redeployment. The American  people want change, of course, in Iraq,  and House Democrats intend to keep  pressing the President to provide it.  f  PASS THE COLLEGE STUDENT  RELIEF ACT  (Ms. SHEA-PORTER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I  am urging my colleagues today to pass  the College Student Relief Act. I speak  not only as a Congresswoman  from  New Hampshire, but also as the mother  of a college student and one about to  enter college.  These student loan interest rates are  absolutely crippling students’ ability  to go to college and putting a burden  on their families. These students are  also deeply concerned now about what  will happen when they go  into the  workforce and they have to pay a higher interest rate on their loans, as well  as paying for higher energy costs and  paying for rent and paying for all of  the other expenses that young adults  experience.  I urge my colleagues to please ease  the pain on these students, encourage  this higher education, because higher  education is the key to prosperity in  our country.  f  SUPPORT THE REDUCTION OF INTEREST RATES  FOR  STUDENT  BORROWERS  (Mr. AL GREEN of Texas asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)

36,House,110,-0.487,12,2007-01-17,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  do not believe we are going to have any  additional speakers so I am going to  yield myself such time as I might consume and close for our side.  Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate the  65th birthday of Muhammad Ali. Ali’s  charisma,  confidence and  skills not  only transformed boxing but the entire  sporting world.  b1115  His unmistakable one-liners and his  quick left jab enamored the public to  the point that Ali said, ‘‘I wish people  would love everybody else the way they  love me. It would be a better world.’’  Born on January 17, 1942 in Louisville, Kentucky, he started to train at  the age of 12 and earned Amateur Athletic Union and Golden Gloves titles as  an amateur. Then known by his birth  name, Cassius Clay, Jr., he became an  Olympic gold medalist and was  renowned for his strong right hand and  his dancing feet. He went on to fight  professionally and revived boxing at an  age when it was plagued by mob control.  The three-time heavyweight champion was  part  of many  legendary  fights,  including  opponents  Sonny  Liston, George Frazier, and George  Foreman. Ali used an unorthodox style  on which he relied on quickness to  dodge punches and to fool challengers  rather than holding his hands high to  defend his  face. Ali’s mix of poetic  movement and powerful blows in the  ring carried over to the comments he  made outside. His knack for creating  rhymes on the  fly and his powerful  paradoxes quoted  to  reporters made  him a magnet for the media. He once  said, ‘‘My way of joking is to tell the  truth. That is the funniest joke in the  world.’’ Ali made no qualms about  what he did or how good he was. He was  backed up in his claims and holds wins  over seven fellow International Boxing  Hall of Fame inductees.  In the early 1980s, Ali was diagnosed  with  pugilistic Parkinson’s  disease,  which  forced  him  into  retirement.  After his retirement and despite his  ailment, Ali has been committed to  many philanthropic efforts to reduce  poverty and hunger, to promote adoption, and to encourage cultural awareness. Ali was named Sportsman of the  Century in 1999 by Sports Illustrated  and is considered to be a modern legend  by many.  So, Mr. Speaker, Ali was indeed the  greatest, but he did leave Louisville  and  eventually moved  to  Chicago,  which is the greatest city, and so I was  fortunate as an individual to get to  know him and to get to know him well.  As a matter of fact, you could always  count on Ali to be present at community events, banquets, it didn’t matter,  local schools, playgrounds where kids  were.  He was a real ambassador for the Nation of Islam and was very involved in  his religious beliefs. A great man of integrity. As a matter of  fact, people  would often meet at his home for community meetings and gatherings and  people would just stop by. He lived in  what we call the Hyde Park community. And so he was indeed the greatest. He had no difficulty sharing himself with others.  So I commend Representative CARSONfor introducing this legislation and  urge its passage.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support of H. Res. 58, which honors  Muhammad Ali on  the occasion of his 65th  birthday. Muhammad Ali, who transformed the  sport of boxing with his unparalleled physical  gifts, social commentary, and poetry, is one of  the world’s most beloved athletes. Muhammad  Ali has been a fixture on the world stage since  the 1960, when he won the gold medal at the  1960 Olympics in Tokyo. He would go on to  win such legendary bouts as ‘‘The Rumble in  the Jungle’’ against George Foreman, and  ‘‘The Thrilla in Manila’’ against ‘‘Smoking Joe’’  Frazier.  Since his retirement in 1981, Muhammad Ali  has engaged  in many humanitarian endeavors, including a 1990 journey to Iraq to negotiate the release of 15 hostages. Muhammad  Ali may be out of the ring but interest in him  has not waned, 3 billion  television viewers  around the world watched him light the torch  that opened the Olympic Games in Atlanta in  1996.  In 1984 Ali was stricken with Parkinson’s disease. However true to form, Ali has  not let his illness stop him from being free to  do what he wants.  Never has a sports figure inspired so many  people  in so many different ways. Ali has  shown that a sport can be more than entertainment; it can also be a cultural event with  the power  to change social values. Muhammad Ali is one of the most recognized sportsmen of all time. His legacy is one that inspires  both in the ring and through his humanitarian  work.  Outside of the ring Ali was a tremendously  important  figure and ally  in  the Civil Rights  Movement of the 1960s. Ali refused to fight in  the Vietnam War due to his religion and because he said, ‘‘Ain’t no Viet Cong done nothing to me.’’ He has won countless awards for  his humanitarian efforts, including the Medal of  Freedom. If anyone is deserving of the accolades that are bestowed on him, Muhammad  Ali is certainly that person.  The Muhammad Ali  International Centre  opened in Ali’s home town of Louisville, Kentucky  in November 2005. The Centre holds  exhibits and provides  learning  initiatives.  It  was established to represent and promote the  values by which Muhammad Ali has lived his  life: confidence, dedication, respect, compassion, charity, and spirituality. It is hoped that  the Centre will provide those that visit the enlightenment and ability to become the greatest  they can be. Ali’s wife Lonnie said of the initiative: ‘‘the Muhammad Ali Centre is all about  searching  for  common ground and establishing peace.’’  On behalf of  the citizens of  the State of  Texas and my constituents of the 18th congressional district I would like to join my colleagues in honoring Muhammad Ali, a global  humanitarian, on  the occasion of his 65th  birthday and extend best wishes to him and  his family. Muhammad Ali reminds us all that  ‘‘learning to love yourself is the greatest love  of all.’’  Happy Birthday, champ! As you often said  after your many victories, you are the ‘‘Greatest of all time!’’  ",2007
37,House,110,-0.256,19,2007-01-17,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the rule providing for consideration of the College Student Relief Act. This bill is good for students,  it is good for the budget, and it is deserving of our support. This bill will  help make college more affordable to  students who need it most by cutting  the interest rate in half on subsidized  student loans.  College costs, as we all know, have  risen dramatically. In the last 5 years,  the cost of attending a 4-year public  college increased $3,095, or by 34 percent. Interest rates the students pay on  college loans have also risen this year  to a fixed rate of 6.8 percent. This combination of  factors makes attending  college more expensive, if not impossible, for some of today’s high school  students.  This bill, the bill before us, takes a  long first step towards making college  more affordable. Each year it cuts the  interest rate that undergraduates will  pay on the standard subsidized student  loans until that rate is cut in half to  3.4 percent  in the year 2011. At the  same time, the bill we have before us  will save the Federal Government by  reducing the deficit by a significant  sum.  That is why this bill meets all of the  tests laid down by the pay-as-you-go  rule which the House adopted on January 5. That rule requires that direct  spending or mandatory  spending be  budget neutral or deficit neutral over 6  years, 2007 through 2012, and over 11  years as well, 2007 through 2017, which  is as far out as our cost estimates run.  This bill is more than deficit neutral or  budget neutral because it actually reduces the deficits in most years, saving  $1.5 billion in 2007, $65 million over 6  years, and a total of $7.1 billion over  the next 11 years, 2007 through 2017.  So, overall, this bill helps students  get a good college education while  helping us reduce the deficit. It meets  the requirements of PAYGO. It is a bill  and a rule that deserves our support.  I would urge every Member on both  sides to vote for this rule and vote for  the rule that enables it to come to the  floor.  ",2007
38,House,110,0.586,19,2007-01-17,Mr. SESSIONS.," I thank the Speaker.  I also thank the gentleman, a dear  friend of mine from South Carolina, for  talking about how great this is for the  budget. Yet the rule waives points of  order that are contained in the budget.  Being specific, it is an explanation of  the waivers that we found out about.  The bill violates section 302(f) because its direct spending will exceed  the Committee on Education and Labor’s allocation, but that is good for  the budget.  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues have had  an opportunity on this side to talk  about why we are disappointed in this  closed rule and in the Democrats’ failure to provide a comprehensive solution to increasing higher education access  for our students that will help  keep America competitive.  Mr. Speaker, I would ask to insert in  the RECORDan article printed in The  Dallas Morning News, my home newspaper, from January 12, outlining the  way today’s Democrat proposal  fails  and falls short of their past promises.  [From the Dallas Morning News, Jan. 12,  2007]  DEMSPUSHRATECUTFORSTUDENTLOANS  WASHINGTON.—Following up on an election-  year promise, House Democrats said Friday  that they plan quick action to lower interest  rates for student loans.  Their proposal, scheduled for a vote next  week, would cut interest rates on some student loans in half. However, the college tuition plan has been scaled back since it was  first touted on the campaign trail last year.  The interest rate relief would apply only to  need-based loans and doesn’t help people who  take out unsubsidized student loans—a distinction not made in the campaign literature  Democrats handed out before winning control of Congress last fall. The measure also  abandons a pledge to reduce rates for parents  who take out loans to help with their kids’  college costs.  The rate cut for subsidized student loans—  from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent—would be  phased in over 5 years.  The measure would cost just under $6 billion, according to the Congressional Budget  Office.  To avoid increasing the deficit, the bill’s  cost would be offset by trimming subsidies  the government gives lenders and reducing  the guaranteed return banks get when students default. Banks also would have to pay  more in fees.  An estimated 5.5 million students receive  subsidized loans.  Republicans pushed a budget bill through  Congress  last session that cut $12 billion  from student loan programs. Democrats and  student groups argued  the money  should  have been preserved.

39,House,110,-0.385,26,2007-01-17,Mr. KILDEE.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Student Relief Act.  By making college more affordable for  5.5 million students each year, this bill  is a big step in the right direction of  helping low- and middle-income families achieve the American Dream. Not  only is it a step in the right direction,  but it is a step in a new direction.  For years, the President and previous  Congresses have passed billions of dollars of  tax cuts  for  the wealthiest  Americans instead of investing in the  potential of average Americans. The  last Congress put college out of reach  for many families by passing a $12 billion raid on student aid, the largest cut  in the history of the student aid program.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 5 will save the  average borrower who starts at a 4-  year college at Michigan next year  nearly $2,200 over the life of the loan,  and will save the same student who  starts in 2011 more than $4,200.  Madam Speaker, when we debate the  Federal budget around here, we talk  about budget authority and outlays  and offsets, and other complicated accounting procedures. But, in the end,  what we really are talking about are  not just numbers but real people in  every corner of this country, making  tough decisions about their lives.  One of the toughest questions these  days is whether they can afford to attend or stay in college, especially because a college education is more important now than ever. These are real  people with names, not numbers, who  ask that question. They are people who  live in your district.  Very simply, the reason I support  this bill, and the reason I ask my colleagues to join me, is because this bill  will help thousands of students to say  yes to that question.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2007
40,House,110,0.396,26,2007-01-17,Mr. MCKEON.," Madam Speaker, at  this time I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. KELLER), the ranking member  on  the  Higher  Education  Subcommittee.  ",2007
41,House,110,0.458,26,2007-01-17,Mr. KELLER of Florida.," I thank the  chairman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today as the  ranking member on the Higher Education  Subcommittee.  I  believe  in  higher  Pell  grants,  lower  interest  rates, and a leveling off of college tuition. I come to this belief through my  own life experiences. I grew up in relatively  humble  circumstances. My  mom was a single parent who raised  three kids on the modest salary of a  secretary. If it wasn’t for Pell grants  and student loans, I wouldn’t have been  able to go to college and, ultimately,  law school. I believe every child, rich  or poor, deserves the chance to go to  college.  Let us turn to student loans and how  that impacts that. When I graduated  from college in 1986, the student loan  interest rate I had on my loans was 9.5  percent. In 2002, during my first term  here  in Congress, we decided to do  something about that and we joined together, Republicans, Democrats, and  student groups, and approved legislation in January of 2002 fixing the student loan interest rate at 6.8 percent.  On  January  24  of  2002,  Chairman  GEORGEMILLER supported the 6.8 percent rate. He voted for the 6.8 percent  rate, and he said on this floor that we  should be commended for passing the  6.8 percent rate.  Last year, in March of 2006, when we  were passing the higher education bill  on the House floor, Chairman Miller  said that he wanted to now cut the interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. It had a big price tag of $18 billion. He didn’t offer any ways to pay  for it.  Today, he comes before us with another proposal to cut the rate from 6.8  percent, down to 3.4 percent, phased in  over a 5-year period, so you hit the 3.4  percent  in the  final year only. This  price tag is smaller, at $6 billion. And  to their credit, the Democrats have  come forward with a way to pay for it,  and that is mainly by taking money  out of the student lenders’ pockets.  The question before us is one of access. What is the best way to expand  college access? Should we help college  students on the front end afford to go  to  school  by  increasing  their Pell  grants, or do we help college graduates  on the back end by phasing down their  loan interest rates?  I think a better approach would have  been to take some of this $6 billion in  savings and invest it in the Pell grant  program. This is a program we Republicans have been pretty serious about  during my 6 years in Congress, and I  would like to show you a chart reflecting that.  This is the 20-year history of the Pell  grant program. As you can see, in yellow, this is the 10 years the Democrats  were in control of Congress. The red  represents when the Republicans took  control of Congress. You see a steep increase. If they had adopted the proposal we set forth, these charts would  be literally off the charts in terms of  such  a  dramatic  increase  in  Pell  grants.  Now, someone said earlier, well, we  haven’t done enough to increase Pell  grant funding during our time in the  majority over the past 6 years. Let us  take a look at that claim. Overall, Pell  grant funding from 2000 to today has  gone up 71 percent, from $7.6 billion to  $13 billion a year. And we have  increased by 36 percent the number of  children eligible for Pell grants from  3.9 million to 5.3 million. We have a  pretty good record on Pell grants, one  to be proud of.  If they had taken the $6 billion and  invested it in the Pell grant program,  what a dramatic difference  it would  make when you consider the Pell grant  program along with the Pell-eligible  programs  of  competitiveness  grants  and SMART grants.  This is the difference: First-year students would get up to $5,300 a year; second-year  students would get up  to  $5,850; third-year students would get  $8,050; and fourth-year students, up to  $8,050. We made this proposal, went before the Rules Committee, and it was a  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:57 Jan 18, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K17JA7.050 H17JAPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

43,House,110,-0.38,33,2007-01-17,Mr. HARE.," Madam Speaker, I thank  the chairman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, today’s college students are graduating with increasing  levels of student loan debt. In Illinois,  the average Stafford loan debt for students who graduate from a 4-year university is over $14,000. Unfortunately,  the  cost of  college  tuition  is  skyrocketing, forcing more and more students to rely on loans than ever before.  Because  I  believe higher  education  should provide economic opportunities  for our  students and not bankrupt  them, I rise today in support of H.R. 5,  the College Student Relief Act.  This  legislation will  cut  interest  rates on subsidized loans in half, saving  the average student thousands of dollars over the life of his or her loan. Additionally, by making student  loans  more affordable, H.R. 5 allows many  qualified  students  from middle- and  lower-income families to go to college  who would not have been able to go to  college before.  On behalf of the many students in my  district, such as those at Western Illinois University with whom I will be  discussing this issue this weekend, I  will vote for H.R. 5 and will work on  the Education and Workforce Committee to find better opportunities for  students and their hardworking families.  ",2007
44,House,110,0.377,40,2007-01-17,Mr. WICKER.," Madam Speaker, I expect a lot of Members on both sides of  the aisle are going to vote for this legislation. I can’t vote for it because it  doesn’t live up to the rhetoric that we  have heard from the proponents of the  legislation in debate today.  If you want to come up with a bill to,  indeed, make college more affordable  for middle America, then count me in.  If you want to improve access to a college education  for millions and millions of American young people, then  count me in. If you want to do something about the very real problem of  slowing the growth rate of college tuition, which is really what we should be  getting at, then count me in. But I  don’t think this bill does any of that.  And frankly, I am afraid that in the  end this legislation, if enacted, would  actually make  a  college  education  more expensive.  But I have to respond to some comments made by my friend from Virginia, Mr. MORAN, just a few moments  ago to the effect that Republicans are  not  interested  in helping Americans  get a college education, that we somehow have a poor record in supporting  student aid and higher education.  I  would take strong exception to those  remarks, and I would submit to the  contrary, Madam Speaker, that House  Republicans, over 12 years of Republican majorities in this House of Representatives, have a proud record of  working  to  expand  college  access  through a two-pronged effort: Number  one, working to hold institutions more  accountable for their role in college  costs, and this bill does nothing to address  that whatsoever,  and number  two, maintaining a historic bipartisan  commitment to Federal student aid.  Under 12 years of a Republican majority in this House of Representatives we  have achieved record levels of overall  student aid, more than tripled what it  was a decade ago. We funded more Pell  Grants, a two-thirds increase over the  past decade. In addition, the Republican record on student aid  includes  new grant aid for Pell Grant students,  higher loan limits to give students access to more financial aid, lower loan  fees so that students can keep more of  what they borrow, tuition savings and  deductibility,  reduced  student  loan  payments and ending the single holder  rule, student loan relief for higher demand teachers—and certainly, that is  something that we could have hearings  about and have a bipartisan consensus  about, Madam Speaker, targeting this  student aid to those students who plan  to go into difficult areas where there is  a great need in this country—taxpayer  savings through fewer lender subsidies  and, finally, less fraud and abuse in  Federal student aid.  So I would submit that this party has  had a proud 12-year record of accomplishment in student aid, and I could  not let the statements of my very good  friend  from Virginia go uncontested.  We are all  for helping students,  for  making college education more affordable and more accessible and for helping move more people into a higher  education and a better way of life for  them and their families. And I don’t  think this bill gets us there. I think 12  years of Republican leadership is something that we can all be proud of. So I  will be voting against the bill.  ",2007

It  is  amusing  to hear  from  our  friends from the other side of the aisle  who for 12 years have run the show and  are complaining about  some of  the  choices that are being made by some  4,000 institutions of higher education.

47,House,110,-0.408,47,2007-01-17,Mr. ENGEL.," I thank the Chairman  for yielding to me.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5. This legislation will help  ease the burden of student loans that  so many of today’s young people face  by cutting loan interest rates in half  over the next 5 years.  As the father of three, I am all too  familiar with the challenges of financing a college education.  I have one  child  in  law  school, one  in undergraduate school. It is very, very difficult. I can imagine the vast majority  of the American  families that don’t  make what Members of Congress make,  how even more difficult it is for them.  So a college education becomes out of  reach  for many  families. It  is very,  very important.  We are going to cut student loan interest rates in half by the next 5 years.  The vast majority of student loan borrowers are low to middle income students who are burdened with huge  amounts of debt upon graduating. In  my home State of New York, the average subsidized Stafford loan debt for a  4-year graduate is over $14,000, and a  student  starting  school  in  2007 will  save $2,360 over the life of his loan; a  student who starts school in 2011 will  save over $4,500 over the life of this  loan.  These are real savings put directly  into the pockets of people who need it  most, and I am proud that Democrats  have made it a priority to make college more affordable in this 110th Congress. This is the right first step. I  commend the Chairman and  I commend the leadership of the Democrats  here in the 110th Congress.  ",2007
48,House,110,-0.401,54,2007-01-17,Mr. SIRES.," Madam Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief  Act, which cuts interest rates in half over the  next  five years  for undergraduate students  with subsidized loans. As a former teacher, I  understand how  important education  is  to  every child. It ensures that everyone has the  opportunity to succeed and to make the most  of their dreams.  Yet college is soaring out of reach for American  students. Today  the average  student  graduates with $17,500 in loan debt; almost  45 percent more than just 11 years ago. H.R.  5 makes a great first step in reducing the burden on students with these loans. In my home  state of New Jersey, the typical student loan  borrower will save approximately $4,600 over  the life of their loan because of this legislation.  Not only does this bill make college more  affordable, it does so without further increasing the nation’s debt. Specifically, this bill is  paid for by six modest reductions in various  subsidies to lenders and guaranty agencies.  I urge everyone to support making college  more affordable by voting in favor of this legislation.  ",2007
49,House,110,-0.321,54,2007-01-17,Mr. WILSON of Ohio.," Madam Speaker,  Ohio students and their families are struggling.  In fact, Ohio ranks 49th in affordability of college.  Sadly, this is a barrier many hard-working  families cannot overcome. Bright young Ohioans are being shut out because college costs  too much.  Today, by cutting student loan rates in half,  we are opening up important opportunities for  thousands of young Ohioans and young people across the nation.  Just in the first two years, this bill will save  Ohio students an average of $2,230 and  in  four years $4,320.  We should ease the burden on our working  families. We should put our students in a position  to succeed  in school and beyond. This  bill, which cuts student loan rates, does just  that.  ",2007
50,House,110,-0.556,54,2007-01-17,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker, I rise in  strong support of the College Student Relief  Act, which over the next five years will cut the  student  loan  interest  rate  in half  for undergraduate students with subsidized loans. And,  I  take exception  to  this Republican  rhetoric  about what  the Democrats could have done  under Republican domination.  Madam Speaker, Since 2001,  tuition and  fees have increased by 41 percent, after inflation, at  four-year public colleges and by 17  percent (after inflation) at four-year private colleges.  Now, we have a chance to act; otherwise financial barriers will prevent more than 4 million students  from attending a  four-year college and more than 2 million from attending  any college in the coming decade.  That would be a crisis for millions of hard-  working families—but it also would be a crisis  for our country’s ability to compete in the 21st  century economy.  In his article, ‘‘It’s a Flat World, After All,’’  Thomas Friedman argues that America’s historical  economic  advantages  have  disappeared because ‘‘the world is flat, and anyone with smarts; access  to Google; and, a  cheap wireless laptop can join the innovation  fray.’’ No matter where they live in the world.  This means we must  invest more  in our  most valuable resource—our people—and this  bill would do just that.  For example, this bill will save the average  student borrower who starts at a four-year college in California next year nearly $2,500 over  the life of a loan—and will save the same student who starts in 2011 nearly $5,000 over the  life of a loan.  Those savings are necessary to make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans  and in the life of our country as to success  over failure.  I urge my colleagues to join me in support  of this bill.  ",2007
51,House,110,-0.408,54,2007-01-17,Mr. WELCH of Vermont.," Madam Speaker, I  am proud, as part of our first 100 hours, that  Congress has committed to expanding higher  education opportunities  to more Americans.  Education has always been the great equalizer  in  this country. With each generation  doors are opened through greater access to  education.  The health of our economy and prosperity of  our middle class  rests on having a highly-  skilled and well-educated workforce. We all  know stories of working class families struggling to make ends meet to put a child, sometimes the family’s first generation, through college.  It  is a struggle millions of  families go  through, as college costs skyrocket year after  year. Reducing the debt burden these families  and students face is the least Congress can  do  to help meet  their commitment and sacrifice.  H.R. 5 will provide a significant reduction in  student  loan  interest rates  for students who  borrow under the subsidized student loan program.  This legislation is worthy in its intent and it  is legislation I support. However, it is my hope  I  in  rise  to work with my fellow members and the distinguished Chairman of Education and Labor  to recognize the important role small, not-for-  profit lenders play in opening doors to more  working families. I believe it makes sense to  distinguish not only between large and small  lenders, but those that lend on a not-for-profit  basis and who reinvest all revenues into additional student financial assistance.  Our goal is to improve educational opportunities for students and it is a goal I know our  non-profit lenders share.  ",2007
52,House,110,-0.382,54,2007-01-17,Ms. ESHOO.," Madam Speaker,  strong support of H.R. 5.  In today’s increasingly competitive economy,  a college education  is more  important  than  ever. That’s why it’s essential for us to ensure  that anyone who has the desire to receive a  higher education has the opportunity to do so.  Higher education shapes citizens as well as  the future of our country.  Today escalating college costs and legislation passed by  the Republican Majority  in  2006  are  creating  insurmountable  barriers  across the country for students to afford a college education. According  to  the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, financial obstacles will prevent  at least 4.4 million high school graduates from  attending a four-year public college over the  next decade. This is an inexcusable waste of  our most valuable resource, the young people  of our country.  H.R. 5 will lower these barriers, cutting interest rates in half over the next five years for  undergraduate students with subsidized student  loans. This  relief  is  targeted  to  reach  those most in need . . . students and families  making between $26,000 and $68,000. When  fully phased  in,  this  legislation will save  the  typical borrower in California with $15,125 in  subsidized federal student loan debt approximately $4,830 over the life of their loan. All  told, this legislation will provide students with  $5.5 billion  in  financial relief and  is entirely  paid for through adjustments in lender rates,  participation fees for financial institutions and  collection fees for defaulted loans.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in supporting  this  legislation. By doing so we will  take an important step to improve access to  higher education across the country as well as  helping to relieve the burden on middle class  families across the nation.  ",2007
53,House,110,-0.656,61,2007-01-17,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker,  today  Representative WOOLSEY, Representative LEEand I introduced a bill that  would  conclude our  involvement  in  Iraq and bring our troops home. The  bill, H.R. 508, is entitled, Bring Our  Troops Home and Sovereignty of Iraq  Restoration Act of 2007. The bill has 16  original  cosponsors.  Representative  WOOLSEYwas on the floor a moment  ago, and she shared with you some of  the provisions of that bill.  I will reiterate, I will repeat, if enacted, the bill would repeal the use-of-  force authorization passed by Congress  in 2002 and requires a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops and contractors  hired by the U.S. Government within 6  months of the enactment of this bill.  The bill authorizes the President to  support an international stabilization  force in Iraq, if the Iraq government requests such a force, but U.S. troops  would not be permitted to participate  in the international force.  It would turn security activities and  military operations in Iraq over to the  elected  Iraqi  government within  6  months of the date of enactment.  It would prohibit the U.S. from establishing permanent bases in Iraq.  It would cap the number of officers  and employees of the United States assigned to the U.S. embassy in Iraq at  500.  It would accelerate the training and  equipping of Iraq military and security  forces, and pursue security and stability in Iraq through diplomacy.  It would provide assistance to the  Iraqi government  in  recovering cultural and historical artifacts that have  disappeared since the U.S. invaded in  2003.  It will do a number of other things,  but let me wrap this up by saying it  would fully fund veterans’ health care,  including mental health care, for our  returning veterans.  Mr. Speaker, I am spending an inordinate amount of time on this issue,  along with many of my other colleagues, and I have chosen to be a  major cosponsor on this bill because I  feel it is absolutely my responsibility  to not only articulate what is wrong  with this war, but to do everything  that I can to encourage the President  of the United States, the commander in  chief, to bring our troops home.  I think it is important to do this because we have lost over 3,000 American  soldiers. As a matter of fact, I think it  is about 3,034.  I look at the continuing devastation  in Iraq, and I see that just day before  yesterday I believe over 100 Iraqis were  killed and maybe twice as many was  injured and we lost four more American soldiers.  b1815  This has got to stop. We are in control. We can stop this. I am encouraging our Commander-in-Chief to bring  our troops home, and to pursue diplomacy, save lives. Because I believe if  they continue down the path that they  are going, we are going to have a real  blood bath in a short period of time.  This surge, this expansion of the war  that has been advocated and pursued  and pushed by this President is absolutely the wrong thing to do. I know  that he has been advised and he has accepted the advice that he is to go into  Sadr City and he is to confront al-Sadr,  who is the head of a tremendous militia. They have over 50,000 signed up in  that militia and more coming each  day. I don’t want our American soldiers to confront that militia. I don’t  want our American soldiers in the middle of this civil war. I don’t want these  young boys who come from our cities  and our towns and these young girls  who come from our villages and our  hamlets of America to be caught in between Sunnis and Shiites and Kurds.  They don’t know a Sunni from a Shiite. We don’t speak the language. We  haven’t trained people. Even the soldiers that are supposed to be embedded  doing the training can’t speak the language. They are depending on interpreters. And let me tell you, even some  of the soldiers that we are training in  Iraq are turning their backs on us.  They desert our soldiers in the middle  of a conflict, in a confrontation. These  are the ones that we are training, that  authorization  we are depending on to take over the  security of  Iraq somehow.  It  is not  going to happen.  We have to leave, and we should not  be deterred from the mission of leaving  because someone is going to accuse us  of cutting and running. We know how  these sound bites take place. We know  what people do when they want to promote  their  position.  They  will  mischaracterize what is being done. We  have got to have the courage to stand  up and stand up for our American soldiers.  I support and cosponsor this new bill.  I would ask my colleagues to support  it.  Today,  Representative WOOLSEY,  Representative LEEand I introduced a bill today  that would conclude our  involvement  in  Iraq  and bring our troops home.  The bill, H.R. 508 is titled ‘‘Bring the Troops  Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act of  2007.’’  The bill has 16 original cosponsors.  If enacted, the bill would:  Repeals  the  use  of  force  passed by Congress in 2002.  Requires  the complete withdrawal of U.S.  troops and contractors hired by the U.S. government within 6 months of the enactment of  this bill. The bill authorizes  the President  to  support an  international stabilization  force  in  Iraq, if the Iraqi government requests such a  force, but U.S. troops would not be permitted  to participate in the international force;  Turn security activities and military operations in Iraq over to the elected Iraqi government within 6 months of  the date of enactment.  Prohibit  the U.S.  nent bases in Iraq;  Cap the number of officers and employees  of the United States assigned to the U.S. embassy in Iraq at 500;  Accelerate  the  training and equipping of  Iraqi military and security forces;  Pursue security and stability in Iraq through  diplomacy;  Provide Iraqi government assistance in destroying/cleaning up  land mines, unexploded  ordnance and depleted uranium shells;  Provide assistance to the Iraqi government  in recovering cultural and historic artifacts that  have disappeared since  the U.S.  invaded  in  2003;  Provide compensation for Iraqi noncombatant civilian casualties—except for those individuals  that participated  in  the armed  insurgency after May 1, 2003; and  Fully  fund  veterans healthcare,  including  mental health care, for our returning veterans.  This bill stands in stark contrast to President  Bush’s proposal to send more than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq.  The President proposes more of the same,  while we provide a way to remove our troops  from the sectarian civil war in Iraq, return our  troops to their loved ones and begin the process of restoring our credibility throughout the  world.  from establishing permaf  EVEN THE SOLDIERS WILL TELL  YOU: ‘‘NOTHING’S GOING TO HELP’’  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  CARDOZA).

54,House,110,0.644,68,2007-01-17,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I  want to thank the leadership for allowing me to host this hour this evening,  an hour once again of  the Official  Truth Squad. The Official Truth Squad  is a group of individuals who got together almost 2 years ago now, and we  are somewhat frustrated and concerned  about the level of not just rancor here  in  Congress,  but  the  level  of  disinformation and the kind of information that was often being put forward in support of certain legislation  that, in fact, well, Mr. Speaker, just  wasn’t true.  So what we did is to get together,  primarily, a group of freshmen from  the last Congress and put in place this  Official Truth Squad. Our goal, our  purpose, is to raise the level of the  rhetoric, to be a little more positive  than is usually the case here in Washington, and to use facts. To use facts.  We have a number of favorite quotes,  but one we like to use frequently is one  from  former United States Senator  Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who kind of  crystallized what is a real concern here  in Washington,  because  everybody  throws around their own opinions. But  his quote was, ‘‘Everyone is entitled to  their own opinion but not their own  facts.’’  We think that it is extremely helpful  when we are talking about issues to  talk about facts, because if we are not  using facts to base the decisions we  make here in Washington, if we are not  using facts to reach the conclusions,  then it is very likely that we will not  reach the right conclusion.  I have said before, Mr. Speaker, that  in my former life I was a physician,  and I knew if I didn’t use facts and I  didn’t make the right diagnosis, it was  virtually impossible to formulate the  right treatment plan and then have the  patient get well. So we can look at  that as an analogy for what we are trying to do for our Nation, which is to  make the right diagnosis, to formulate  the right proposals and plans and policies and put them in place so that the  patient that is our Nation survives and  thrives and does well.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able  to have the opportunity once again tonight to host an hour of the Official  Truth Squad; and I will be joined by a  number of colleagues, and we will address two or three issues this evening.  We are going to start by talking about  what many  people  have  discussed  around the Nation, and it has kind of  captured the attention of many in the  media, Mr. Speaker, and that is this  issue of the 100-hour agenda that the  majority party, the Democrats, have.  It is curious to look at that for a variety of reasons, but we will look specifically at the amount of time and  kind of what they have been doing with  that 100 hours.  Secondly, we will  talk about  the  issue of student loans. It is a bill we  had here in Congress today, and we are  trying to have facts back up policy as  it relates to how best to provide appropriate loans for students who are trying to reach that American dream all  across this Nation.  Thirdly, we are going to talk a little  about energy policy, something that I  would suggest, Mr. Speaker, needs a lot  of facts brought to the table.  The common theme that I think people will appreciate if they are truly interested in looking objectively at these  three issues, and so many others here  in Congress, the common theme about  these three issues tonight, I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, is broken promises.  Broken promises.  In fact, when you look at these issues  independently, I think you will be able  to see as we go through them the broken promises that have occurred just  in these first 2 weeks in Congress.  And why is it important, Mr. Speaker, for promises to be kept? Well, you  know, we hear all the time from the  other side that people voted last November for a change. And they did vote  for a change; there is no doubt about  it. There were a lot of things we in the  majority could have done better. But  people across this Nation based their  votes upon information that they had.  They based their votes upon what they  were being told and what they were  being promised by the other side. So if  those promises aren’t kept, then that  is important.  It is important for a variety of reasons. One is that the policies that were  promoted and were espoused as being  the be-all and end-all for our Nation  aren’t being carried out by the majority party. But as important as that is,  Mr. Speaker, maybe even more important is the fact that when people go to  the polls and they vote, and they rely  on what Members of Congress who are  ultimately successful have told them  they were going to do, and then those  things aren’t done, all that does, Mr.  Speaker, is breed a cynicism and a disgust with our form of government and  our Representatives, and makes it so  that it is extremely difficult to move  forward in a positive direction for our  Nation.  I want to talk a little bit about the  100-hour clock, and then we will have  some others, I know, who will be interested in speaking about that. There has  been a lot of talk about this 100 hours,  this wonderful 100 hours in which the  Democrat majority was going to get all  these grand things done. And it was  promised,  it was promised,  this  100  hours.  Now, what we have seen over this period of time is that that 100 hours has  changed. Initially, the first 100 hours  was going to be, to quote the Speaker  on October 6, 2006, she said,  ‘‘In the  first 100 hours the House meets after  Democrats win control,’’ and then she  went on to describe what they were  going to do. The first 100 hours the  House meets after Democrats take control.  Then it soon morphed into, well, it  will be the first 100 legislative hours.  On December  1, after  the  election,  when they began looking at what they  were going to do and how they were  going to make it happen, they said, on  December 1, 2006, ‘‘In our first 100 legislative hours in office we have a bipartisan and an achievable plan.’’  Mr. Speaker, as you well know, that  kind of went by the wayside as well.  And when we called them on it, we said  what 100 hours is it, the new majority  leader, Mr. HOYER from Maryland, put  it best when he kind of talked about,  well, we will try to do it in 100 hours.  Maybe we will get it done, maybe we  won’t. But then he said, ‘‘It all depends  on how you are counting 100 hours.’’  And he is right. He is right. It all depends on how you are counting the 100  hours. If you have the desire to deceive  the American  people  and  turn  the  clock on and off whenever you want to,  then you get to about 33 hours, which  is what the Democrat clock tells us  they have taken.  This is our third week, Mr. Speaker,  our third week here. So what does that  mean? It means that we are working  about 10 hours a week. About 10 hours  a week. I think the American people  are working a whole lot more than 10  hours a week. A reasonable amount of  time, given that we have been sworn in  for about 14 days, 2 full weeks, a reasonable amount of time may be 80. And  that is about the sense of how many  hours we have in fact been in session.  As of 7 p.m. tonight, Mr. Speaker, we  will have been in session 81 hours and  53 minutes. So that is a reasonable estimate. But the total,  if you really  keep track of 100 hours, the total time  as of noon today was 336 hours. As of  noon today, 336 hours.  Now,  people may  say, well,  that  doesn’t make a whole lot of difference  what the time is. But, Mr. Speaker, it  does, because the promises were made  and the promises have been broken.  Again, as Mr. HOYER says, it all depends  on  how  you’re  counting  100  hours. Kind of reminds me of the quote  about the definition of ‘‘is,’’ doesn’t it,  Mr. Speaker?  We are  so pleased  to have many  members of our conference who want  to  take part  in  the Official Truth  Squad, and  tonight we have a new  friend to me and to our conference,  Congressman DAVID the gentleman from Tennessee, who is a freshman. This is his first term in Congress.  He began a small business, a very  successful  individual  back  in Tennessee, and he has great perception on  the processes of legislation because he,  like I, served 8 years in his State legislature. So I am very, very pleased to  welcome Congressman DAVIS to  the  DAVIS,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:25 Jan 18, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A17JA7.076 H17JAPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007
55,House,110,-0.363,75,2007-01-17,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, it  is an honor to come before the House  once again.  As  you  know,  the  30-Something  Working Group, we come to the floor  to share not only with the Members  but also the American people the great  things that are happening here under  the Capitol dome and some things that  Members should be informed of that  could happen under the Capitol dome if  we were able to work in a bipartisan  way.  But  I am so happy, Mr. Speaker,  today because we are on  the  floor  today, and we have a number of issues  that we want to share with not only  Members but also the American people.  I am excited about all these bipartisan  votes that have been taking place over  the last 90-something-odd hours that  have taken place.  I am glad to have good friends from  all over the country. We are going to  have the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. ALTMIRE) that is going to join us,  and also  the gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. MURPHY) is going to join  us tonight.  I think it is important for us to really reflect on some of the things that  have been happening.  Mr. Speaker, if I may make an inquiry, how much time do we have, sir?  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  of Ohio). The gentleman  from  Florida has 58 minutes remaining.  ",2007

57,House,110,-0.404,75,2007-01-17,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," While we were  down here, you were probably running  through bingo halls and bowling alleys;  and Mr. ALTMIRE, who is just across  the border from me in western Pennsylvania, I think the impact that you  have already had on Congress, you  have all spoken on the floor. You all  did and have done numerous press  events representing our party, and I  think you have done a tremendous job.  So it is good to have you here with certain expertise, whether  it  is health  care or labor, whatever the issue may  be. We have got a very talented freshman class.  The reason we are still down here and  we just did not quit when the elections  were over is that this is about more  than just the 100 hours, and we are  going to hammer this 100 hours home  and get it through and do what the  American people asked us to do. But  kind of the new energy and spirit that  you guys bring is going to move us well  past that 100 hours into something that  is going to be very special.  So I would be happy to yield over to  my  friend  from Pennsylvania  right  across the border, the same media market.  ",2007
58,House,110,-0.133,75,2007-01-17,Mr. ALTMIRE.," Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk about what we did today. We  have had a fantastic couple of weeks  with the 100 hours, and we are going to  talk a lot about that, but today specifically we did something that is going to  impact just about every American with  children in this country. We cut the interest rate on student loans in half.  And currently  interest rates are 6.8  percent; we are going to cut them down  to 3.4 percent, and that is going to have  an  impact on people all across the  country.  I wanted to take a  few moments  today and talk about what this is going  to do for students in my district and  for the impact per college in my district.  I have a college called LaRoche College where I served on the board of  trustees for two terms. It is in my district. It is a private liberal arts college,  and for students who are entering this  year, over the lifetime of their loan,  they are going to see savings of $2,120  over the time of this loan. And because  this is phased in over 5 years, for students in 2011, for those parents who  may have children that are going to  enter college in 2011, over the lifetime  of their college, if they go to LaRoche  College, they are going to save over  $4,000. On average across the country,  it is over $4,500, and I think that is  something we can be proud of in this  House of Representatives.  ",2007

Talk  about a great thing for our balance of  payments.  You talked about the original Apollo  project. We have named our bill, the  first step we will talk about tomorrow,  the New Apollo Energy Project because  we believe, as John F. Kennedy did,  that we have unlimited innovative capacity. But what we don’t have at the  moment are policies to put that innovative genius to work.  For instance, we are spending less  than 16 percent on energy research in  total  in  this country. We are only  spending 16 percent of what we spent  on the Apollo project. That  is  just  abysmal. We had at least as much of a  challenge as trying to get to the Moon.  I had a utility executive in my office  today. He told me this  factoid: We  spend more on research about dog food  than the utility industry does on new  energy in this country. I don’t want to  belittle dog food, it is important, but  we need to boost our research. Tomorrow we will put $14 billion back into  the pockets of Americans to use in part  for  research,  the  tremendous  things  that are going on.

62,House,110,-0.319,89,2007-01-17,Mr. HALL of New York.," I am just  looking at the uses of the Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve, and I will get that out in one  sentence, to accelerate the use of clean  domestic renewable energy resources  and alternative fuels, to promote the  utilization of energy efficient products  and practices and conservation, and to  increase research development and deployment of clean, renewable energy  and  energy  efficiencies  and  technologies.  The word ‘‘conservation’’ is in there,  and it is one that has been sadly neglected. In fact, it was unfortunate a  few years ago when our Vice President  said conservation may be a personal  virtue, but it is no way to build a national energy policy. I completely disagree. I think it is one of the most important ways to start building a national energy policy, and I was happy  Mr.  earlier was  talking  about energy efficiency. It is time all  of us on both sides of the aisle did that  and put our money where those words  are.  BARTLETT I see these pet peeves of mine as I go  through every day life. For instance,  walking down the aisle of the supermarket, in the Northeast, I can walk  through Hanford’s A&P  or Stop &  Shop, and there are aisle after aisle of  cold  cases with yogurt or beer or  cheese that is being kept cold by a refrigerator and a compressor running all  of the time, and an open top so it is  convenient. I can just reach in. But  there is no door or plastic sheet to  keep the cold air in and the warm air  out. Meanwhile, because we live in the  northern part of the country, half of  the year there is a furnace going to  keep the shoppers warm and the furnace and the compressor are working  at cross purposes. That is the kind of  blindness we have gotten used to, that  energy  is  something we  can  throw  away.  ",2007

65,Senate,110,-0.266,124,2007-01-17,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  want to point out, I was on the floor  when this item was discussed, when the  Senator from New Hampshire offered  his line-item veto amendment. I was  also on the floor when Senator CONRAD,  who is our side’s budget expert, came  forward and debated it.  There was a rather fulsome debate. I  want to recount what Senator CONRAD  said about his belief about the amendment, that not only does it raise serious  constitutional  concerns,  but  it  would allow the President to unilaterally block enacted  funding, even  if  Congress rejects a proposed rescission.  In addition, rather than strengthening  fiscal discipline, the amendment could  lead to more spending, not  less. He  pointed out how it could be used to  eliminate entire new programs or improvements to benefits such as Medicare and Social Security. The President would have a year after a bill’s enactment to propose a rescission. The  President could package rescissions as  he or she wishes and could combine rescissions that have been enacted in several different pieces of legislation. Senators would be forced to vote on the  package with  little opportunity  for  public notice or input and no opportunity to offer amendments, nor would  there be any opportunity to filibuster  proposed rescissions. The new power  would make it much easier for a President to eliminate new Medicare or Social Security benefits to which he objects.  Now, I agree very much with what  the majority leader said. This is a very  problematic amendment.  It was debated on the floor of the Senate. It  needs further refinement if anybody is  going to move ahead with it. Clearly, it  is a major amendment. Clearly, it is a  real problem for our side. But for the  minority to take down the bill over  this amendment when the amendment  is not germane to the bill, when I have  tried very hard to keep matters that  are not within the scope of the bill off  the bill, including a matter I myself  very much wanted to present, I think  makes no sense.  The minority leader pointed out that  this bill passed before, 2 years ago, by  a vote of 90 to 8. The whole point of  this legislation is to show that the two  sides can come together, be bipartisan,  and enact a bill that will bring about  ethics, lobbying, and earmark reform.  And we have done that.  As Senator BENNETT,  the  ranking  member, and I have sat on this floor,  there has been ample time for Members  to bring their amendments to the floor.  I assure you that there has been a lot  of time when we have just sat here in  a quorum call. To allow this bill to be  pulled down at this time is just a special matter of some kind of pique, when  we  know  that  the  line-item  veto  amendment is extraordinarily problematic and deserves another venue, deserves more scrutiny, and should take  some time before it is passed in any  way, shape, or form.  So I am fully in support of what the  majority leader had to say. It makes  no sense  for the other side to take  down this bill over it. I hope the proposal made by the majority leader will  be accepted. I believe he will keep his  word. I will help in any way I possibly  can to see that that is, in fact, the  case. But we are so close to getting  this bill done, and it has some momentous things in it that represent a total  change of the way these bodies operate,  and they are  important, significant,  and timely. We ought to pass this bill.  We ought to show the American people  that we can work  together, Republicans and Democrats, for a common  purpose. So I just want to say that  after a week and a half, I am profoundly  disappointed  that  this  has  come about. I really thought we were  going to be able to work together and  pass a strong, bipartisan bill. And, in  fact, most of the amendments have  passed by huge majorities.  I  think  there have only been two that have  been relatively close.  I urge the Republican side to reconsider. There are so many positive elements of this bill, and the American  people will be so shortchanged if we  cannot solve whatever problem there is  between us and pass a bill that we  voted on 90 to 8 some time ago, which  has even been strengthened by some of  the eight members who voted against  it because they didn’t think  it was  strong enough. This is a very strong  measure.  Those of us who will work in conference will work to smooth out any  bumps. We will work in an open way,  and no side will be shut out of the conference. I pledge it will be a collegial  conference. This is our opportunity to  set an agenda for the 110th Congress.  Please, please, please, let us not reject  this.  I yield the floor.  ",2007
66,Senate,110,-0.362,124,2007-01-17,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, we have  been working for a week and a half on  this bill, S. 1, which is the highest priority of the Democratic majority  in  the new Congress because we believe,  as  it  says, providing greater  transparency in the legislative process is a  starting point. Trying to restore public  confidence in the way we work here is  a starting point.  I was heartened by the fact that this  bill, as well as the substitute amendment and other amendments offered,  has  largely been bipartisan. Most of  the debate has been bipartisan in nature. With few exceptions, the rollcalls  have been bipartisan. It troubles me  that we have reached this procedural  impasse with the minority that, with  the power given to it in the Senate, is  threatening to bring down this bill. I  am searching my mind to understand  why they would want to bring down a  bill that would clean up this culture of  corruption  in Washington and make  substantial ethical changes.  I have come to the conclusion that it  has to do with indigestion. What I am  referring to is this: For every decision  in political life there is usually a good  reason and a real reason.

It is clear we are at an  impasse. That  frequently happens  in  the Senate. It is not at all unusual. It  is also not at all unusual to have nongermane amendments offered on bills.  They are offered on virtually every bill  that goes through the Senate. So there  is nothing extraordinary happening on  this bill that we do not see in the Senate with great repetition on bill after  bill after bill after bill.  We have been working in good faith  to reach an agreement with respect to  Senator GREGG’s amendment on enhanced rescission. I wish to thank the  Senator from New Hampshire for his  patience in that regard. He was here  early on this bill. He offered it a week  ago—it has now been pending for an entire week—and is prepared for a vote.  Now, the majority leader, to his credit, was attempting to reach an agreement to allow for a vote on this issue  at a later date. He mentioned it needed  to be sufficiently debated.

Vertebrate fossils are rare and important natural resources that have become increasingly  endangered due to an increase in the illegal collection of fossil specimens for  commercial sale. However, at this time  there is no unified policy regarding the  treatment of  fossils by Federal  land  management  agencies which would  help protect and conserve fossil specimens. Consequently, we risk the deterioration or loss of these valuable scientific resources. This Act will correct  that omission by providing uniformity  to the patchwork of statutes and regulations that currently exist. By creating a comprehensive national policy  for preserving and managing paleontological resources  found on Federal  land, this Act will also be instrumental  in curtailing and preventing future illegal trade thereby ensuring that many  generations to come will have access to  these invaluable records of our past. I  would like to emphasize that this bill  covers only paleontological remains on  Federal lands and in no way affects archaeological  or  cultural  resources  under  the Archaeological Resources  Protection Act of 1979 or the Native  American Graves Protection and Rehabilitation Act.  I would also mention that this bill is  exactly the same bill that I introduced  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:14 Jan 18, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A17JA6.044 S17JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007
69,,110,0.375,180,2007-01-17,Mr. SHUSTER.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to highlight an American success story,  an  inspirational Pennsylvanian and a great  American, Joe Hardy, III. Joe Hardy is the embodiment of the idea that, as Winston Churchill said, ‘‘We make a living by what we get and  we make a life by what we give.’’ This month  marks Joe Hardy’s 84th birthday and it is only  right  that his achievements  in business and  his contributions  to society be celebrated  in  this, the people’s House.  Joe Hardy  is perhaps best known as  the  founder of 84 Lumber,  the  largest privately  owned building materials supplier  to professional contractors in America. But he is much  more than this. He is a self-made man, a civic  leader and a great philanthropist. He  is  the  embodiment of the American Dream and his  story continues  to encourage  those around  him.  With 84 Lumber, Joe Hardy reached a level  in business that thousands of smaller entrepreneurs aspire to reach for themselves. And  like many Americans  just starting out  in  the  world of business, Joe Hardy did not inherit  his success; he built it from the ground up. His  is a true American success story, a story that  is alive and well today.  When Joe Hardy graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in engineering  he  joined his  family’s  jewelry company. He  demonstrated his business acumen early, and  quickly became the company’s best salesman.  But Joe Hardy wanted to make his own name  in the business world, so in 1952, with his own  savings and  the help of some  friends, he  opened a cash-and-carry lumber yard for contractors in the town of Eighty-Four, Pennsylvania.  In 1956 he changed his company’s  name from Green Hills Lumber to 84 Lumber  and the rest, as they say, is history.  84 Lumber grew quickly, reaching $84 million in sales in 1971 and $1 billion in sales in  1996. As his company and his fortune grew,  Joe Hardy began to give back to the communities that had given him the chance to succeed. In 1987, he bought the Nemacolin Resort in a bankruptcy sale and turned it into a  major economic draw and  tourist destination  for Western Pennsylvania.  He brought a PGA tournament to the world  class Nemacolin Resort that not only drew attention to the area, but raised money for worthy causes. The list of philanthropic achievements in this area is long, but a few examples  stand out.  Over  the past 15 years, Joe Hardy’s 84  Lumber Golf Tournaments have raised over  $1 million for the Westmoreland-Fayette Boy  Scout Council. He organized a PGA Tour  event from 2003 to 2006 that raised more than  $6 million for local charities and $1.3 million  for  Hurricane  Katrina  relief.  Additionally,  through his long collaboration with Habitat for  Humanity, Joe Hardy enabled the funding and  construction of 50 homes along the hurricane  ravaged Gulf Coast.  But his philanthropy does not end there. In  1990, Joe Hardy gave a grant to Washington  and Jefferson College  to start an Entrepreneurial Spirit Studies Program as well as a  scholarship  fund  its participation. This celebrated program continues to train tomorrow’s  business leaders today.  In addition  to philanthropy, Joe Hardy  is  also civically engaged. He continues to serve  as a County Commissioner for Fayette County  Pennsylvania and personally invested his own  money into the revitalization of Uniontown, the  hometown of General George C. Marshall.  The list of Joe Hardy’s accomplishments is  simply too long to cover here. However, to the  people of Fayette County, the contributions he  has made to their lives are evident everyday.  Whether you walk down the streets of a revitalized Uniontown, enjoy a jump in business  due to the Nemacolin Woodlands Resort, or  build your new house with 84 Lumber products, Joe Hardy’s impact is there.  I want to wish Joe Hardy a happy 84th birthday and  thank him  for all he has done  throughout his life. With his achievements and  outlook on life, I am sure we will see many  more successes in the years ahead.  f  HONORING THE CAREER OF BILL  SMITH  HON.

70,,110,-0.204,180,2007-01-17,Mr. GORDON of Tennessee.,"  Madam  Speaker, I rise today to honor the banking career of Bill Smith, who, as he puts it, started  out as an errand runner and left as chairman  of the board.  Bill began working  for  the Bank of Commerce in Woodbury, Tennessee, in 1950. At  the  time,  there were  five other employees  working at the bank on the west side of the  Cannon County Square. He began as a runner and went on to fill many other positions at  the bank, including using a pen and ledger to  keep the balance of the entire bank.  In 1954, the bank moved to its current location on the north side of the square, and Bill  continued moving up. In 1964, an addition was  added to the bank, and Bill earned the title of  vice president.  In 1967, the Bank of Commerce was sold to  Third National Bank, and Bill became president.  Another  addition  to  the Woodbury  branch was added in 1982. Under Bill’s leadership, the Bank of Commerce sponsored the  Cannon County Good Ole Days for 25 years  and started  the annual Red Apple Days  in  Auburntown. Bank branches were built and  obtained  in  the Edgefield community and  in  Auburntown.  When the bank sold in the early 1980s, it  had grown to about 50 full-time and 20 part-  time employees. The bank sold again in 1991  to Regions, and Bill’s son, Steve, who had  begun working  for  the bank while attending  Middle Tennessee State University, became  president. Bill became chairman of the board  until he retired from the banking industry on  August 31, 2005.  In his so-called  retirement, Bill has been  helping his son, Mike, with their family business, Smith Funeral Home, and managing his  family  farm. He  is an active member of  the  Church of Christ.  Christine Dillon, who has worked with Bill  since 1951, both at the bank and the funeral  home, says Bill  is described by  friends as  kind,  friendly, a good Christian and a great  marketing person. He  is much  loved by his  friends and former banking colleagues. I congratulate Bill on his retirement, and I wish him  many years of happiness.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE HAITIAN  PROTECTION ACT OF 2007  HON. ALCEE L.

According to section 244A of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990, TPS may be  granted when: there is ongoing armed conflict  posing a serious threat to personal safety; it is  requested by a foreign state that temporarily  cannot handle the return of nationals due to  environmental disaster; or extraordinary and  temporary conditions  in a  foreign state exist  which prevent aliens from returning.

72,,110,-0.454,187,2007-01-17,Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to honor  Judge Santiago  Campos by reintroducing legislation to name  the Federal courthouse  in Santa Fe, New  Mexico, after him. We are approaching  the  sixth anniversary of his passing, which occurred on January 20, 2001, and naming this  courthouse after the first Hispanic appointed to  the Federal bench in New Mexico is a long  overdue  tribute.  I am again pleased  to be  joined  in  introducing  this  legislation by Representatives  MCDERMOTT, GREEN, and PASTOR. They have  all cosponsored in the past and I thank them  for cosponsoring again.  Judge Santiago Campos was the first Hispanic appointed to the Federal bench in New  Mexico, serving from 1978 until his death in  2001,  including as  chief  judge  from 1987  through 1989. Judge Campos’ career of public  service only culminated with his service as a  United States District Court Judge, as he also  served in the United States Navy as a seaman  first class from 1944 to 1946, as the Assistant  and First Assistant Attorney General of New  Mexico from 1954 to 1957, and as a District  Court Judge from 1971 to 1978 in the First Judicial District  in  the State of New Mexico.  Judge Campos served with distinction on the  bench and displayed both firmness and compassion with those who entered his courtroom.  He was a life long resident of New Mexico and  graduated first in his law school class at the  University of New Mexico.  Judge Campos was very active in his courtroom, often exercising his right to question witnesses  in  the middle of cross-examinations.  Many agree that he became more involved in  a case than other judges, but still let a lawyer  try his own case. One of his most memorable  cases ordered the Gannett Co. to return the  New Mexican, Santa Fe’s daily newspaper, to  its former owner, Robert McKinney, due to a  breach of contract.  During his career, Campos was an honorary  member of the Order of the Coif. He also received the Distinguished Achievement Award  of the State Bar of New Mexico in 1993, and  in the same year the University of New Mexico  honored him with a Distinguished Achievement Award.  Madam Speaker, following his passing, the  New Mexico State legislature passed a joint  memorial  requesting Congress  to name  the  Federal courthouse in Santa Fe, New Mexico,  after Judge Campos. Judge Campos had his  chambers in this courthouse for over 22 years.  In addition,  the  judges of  the Tenth Circuit  Court of Appeals who reside in New Mexico  and the district judges of the District of New  Mexico unanimously  requested and support  congressional action  to name  the Federal  courthouse after Judge Campos. I am pleased  to once again take up this effort.  I am hopeful this will be the year to get this  legislation passed and  signed  into  law  to  honor this great man with a small token of appreciation for the remarkable life that he lived.

STEVE ISRAEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 9, 2007  ",2007
73,,110,-0.334,187,2007-01-17,Mr. ISRAEL.," Mr. Speaker, on September  11th, 2001, my congressional district lost well  over one hundred people; and tens of thousands of lives were shattered.  So it is on their behalf that I rise today and  support passage of this bill, to implement the  recommendations of the bipartisan 9–11 Commission.  I am grateful that the first bill to be passed  in the first hours of a new majority is this one.  Because America can’t afford to wait another  minute. We’ve had 51⁄2 years of excuses,  delays, postponements and  lobbying. That’s  51⁄2years too long.  Even  today, Mr. Speaker,  there are some  who doubt we can meet  the deadlines  to  screen air cargo in 3 years and shipping cargo  in 5 years.  Mr. Speaker, America’s greatest  triumphs  were not achieved by saying ‘‘it’s too hard.’’  They were secured by refusing to take no for  an answer.  In  1962,  5  years  after  Sputnik  was  launched, John F. Kennedy said, ‘‘By the end  of the decade we will land on the moon.’’  In 2007, over 5 years after 9–11, we are  saying,  ‘‘by  the end of  the decade we will  screen all air cargo on our planes.’’  If we could research, develop, engineer and  build the systems that lifted people into space,  out of orbit, propel  them  to  the moon,  land  them on the moon, bring them back to their  capsule,  return  to earth, survive a  fiery  re-  entry and deposit them safely in the ocean—  then we should be able to figure out how to  screen air cargo in a way that minimizes risk  and  inconvenience  to people who get on  planes.  Mr. Speaker, when  it came  to securing  America’s place in the world, President Kennedy didn’t say ‘‘I wish we could land a man  on the moon but it’s not easy enough, so instead we’ll send a bus to Des Moines.’’  Mr. Speaker, when  it came  to preserving  our  national  survival, President Roosevelt  didn’t say, ‘‘Yesterday was a day of infamy, so  let’s spend 51⁄2years figuring out how to respond with  the  least  inconvenience  to  the  American people.’’  Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the safety  and security of my constituents, there can be  no more excuses, no further delay, no higher  priority.  And  to  those who disagree with me, who  earnestly and honorably believe we must continue to study feasibility and practicalities, I will  share other words of President Kennedy, from  that same speech when he told America we  would go to the moon:  We choose to go the moon in this decade  and do the other things, not because they are  easy, but because they are hard, because  that goal will serve to organize and measure  the best of our energies and skills, because  that challenge is one that we are willing to  accept, one we are unwilling to postpone,  and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.

74,,110,-0.432,187,2007-01-17,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to introduce a bill which is a companion  measure to legislation introduced by Senator  DANIELAKAKA in the Senate this morning. This  measure is called the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007. The purpose of the bill is to provide a process for the  reorganization of  the Native Hawaiian governing entity  for  the purposes of a  federally  recognized  government-to-government  relationship.  On this day 114 years ago, the monarchy of  the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown by  agents of the United States. This injustice created wounds and issues that have never been  healed or resolved. Fourteen years ago, the  United States government took a step toward  reconciling  this part of history by passing a  resolution which acknowledged the overthrow  of the Kingdom of Hawaii and offered an apology to Native Hawaiians.  The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act would  take another step  in  the  reconciliation process by providing Native Hawaiians the same right of self-governance and  self-determination that are afforded to other indigenous peoples. Since Hawaii was annexed  as a territory, the United States has treated  Native Hawaiians in a manner similar to that  of American Indians and Alaska Natives. This  bill would formalize that relationship and establish parity in federal policies towards all of  our indigenous peoples.  This bill will also provide a structured process to address the longstanding issues resulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This discussion has been avoided for far  too long because no one has known how to  address or deal with the emotions that arise  when these matters are discussed. There has  been no structured process. Instead, there has  been fear as to what the discussion would entail, causing people to avoid the issues. Such  behavior has led to high levels of anger and  frustration, as well as misunderstandings between Native Hawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians.  The bill provides a structured process to negotiate and resolve these issues with the federal and state governments and will alleviate  the growing mistrust, misunderstanding, anger,  and frustration about these matters.  This measure is supported by Hawaii’s Governor, Linda Lingle, Hawaii’s Congressional  delegation, and the Hawaii State Legislature.  The bill is also supported by a number of organizations in Hawaii who have passed resolutions in support of enacting this bill.  I ask my colleagues to support this measure  and advance the reconciliation process for our  people.

They are pushing  forward a  measure to allow the territory Delegates, nonvoting Members of Congress  traditionally, actually, not Members of  Congress on a technical basis because  they don’t represent States, their constituents don’t pay Federal  income  taxes, they are going to allow these individuals to cast votes and even preside  when the Chamber meets. So let’s have  a quick Q&A on this; let’s talk questions and answers here.  Why would the Democrats do this?  Because 80 percent of the territory Delegates are, hold for an answer here,  they are Democrats. They want  to  cushion their numbers. Why is this an  abuse of power? Well, there is this little thing we Americans call the Constitution. It says, ‘‘The House shall be  comprised of Members chosen by the  people of the several States,’’ not territories, not mayors of cities allowed to  vote on this House floor, not any individual, but  ‘‘comprised of Members  chosen by the people of the several  States,’’ not non-State territories. But  plainly the Democrats are cushioning  their numbers and abusing their power.  thank my  colI  The Democrats’ power grab is a continuation of the abusive policies and  actions they have taken since day one  in this institution. Since day one they  have shut down all debate. Since day  one they have shut down the committee process. They held open a vote  to change the outcome because they  were  losing on  the vote. They  ran  through the Speaker’s special interest  project  affectionately  known  as  TunaGate, and all without  fulfilling  their pledge of working a 5-day week.  In fact, in 3 weeks we only worked 40  hours  in this House. That  is a new  Democrat majority, that is a continuation of the abuse of power.  What we have to do today is vote  down this legislation that is, first, unconstitutional, and second, an abuse of  power by the Democrat majority.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on  this measure.  ",2007

78,House,110,0.688,20,2007-01-24,Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey.,"  Madam Speaker, I rise, too, in strong  opposition to this resolution which violates the Constitution and the fundamental intent of the Framers of the  Constitution as well, and it does so in  four ways.  First,  it would allow Delegates to  vote, even though our Founding Fathers  intended  that  this  legislative  body  represent  the  people  of  the  States. The Constitution, Article  I,  section 2, clause 1, states, ‘‘The House  of Representatives shall be composed  of Members chosen by the people of the  several States.’’ By definition, Delegates do not represent States.  Secondly, this resolution violates the  principle of one person, one vote.  The average  congressional district  represents approximately 650,000 people, but three of these areas have populations of less than 160,000 people, and  American Samoa has residents of less  than 57,000 people.  The Supreme Court has already spoken on this. In 1964, the decision of  Wesberry  v. Sanders,  the Supreme  Court said,  ‘‘To say a vote is worth  more in one district than in another  would run not only counter to our fundamental ideas of a democrat government, but it would also cast aside the  principles of the House of Representatives elected by the people. That was a  principle tenaciously fought for and established at the Constitutional Convention.’’  Thirdly, the qualifications for these  Delegates are not the same as all the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:43 Apr 19, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD07\H24JA7.REC H24JA7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

In honor of that  ride in 1907, the Curtiss Museum and  the City of Ormond Beach, Florida,  which  is  the  ‘‘birthplace of  speed,’’  hosted a Curtiss motorcycle run on the  beach today, January 24, 2007.  In addition  to his  recordbreaking  speed, which was 137 miles an hour, Mr.  Curtiss was the founder of the Curtiss  Aeroplane and Motor Company, now  part of the Curtiss-Wright Corporation.  Glenn Curtiss also developed the first  successful sea plane and manufactured  the famous World War I Jenny training  plane.  Again, Madam Speaker,  it  is with  great pride that I rise today to honor  the memory of Mr. Glenn Curtiss, and  I encourage all Members to join me in  honoring the legacy of Mr. Curtiss and  cosponsoring House Resolution 84.

80,House,110,-0.256,34,2007-01-24,Mr. HODES.," Mr. Speaker. Last night  I watched the State of the Union Address in this hall for the first time as a  Member of Congress. While I found the  pageantry inspiring, I wish I could say  the same about the speech itself.  We heard another attempt to allay  with hollow rhetoric the concerns of an  alarmed Nation about the war in Iraq.  And rather than seizing an opportunity  to level with the American people and  set the new course they rightly demand, the administration, once again,  chose to cling to its delusions and insist that its failing policies be enacted.  In 2003, the administration requested  and received from Congress authority  to invade Iraq on the basis of the claim  that Iraq possessed weapons of mass  destruction and presented an imminent  threat to our national security. Senior  administration officials claimed that  the Iraqi Government was connected  with the al Qaeda terrorists who perpetrated the attacks of September 11,  2001. And we now know that neither the  premise  for the  invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq nor the claim  of a connection to 9/11 was true.  After the fall of Baghdad, the administration sent in officials with little or  no knowledge and understanding of  Iraq, its people, its culture or its politics. Costly mistakes,  including  the  dismantling of the army and the failure to secure weapons stockpiles, paved  the way for the current situation in  Iraq: More than $450 billion spent with  billions unaccounted for; an undependable Iraqi Government, unwilling or incapable of controlling warring sects in  their militias; more than 3,000 American deaths, and more than 25,000 soldiers maimed or grievously wounded;  hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians  killed, wounded or driven from their  homes by sectarian violence; and a profound loss of respect for our country in  the region and around the world.  All in all, it constitutes an unparalleled  foreign policy disaster  for the  United States.  The administration still has no plans  for a responsible exit strategy to protect our security. And unbelievably,  the administration wants to send an  additional 21,000 troops to Iraq.  The proposal is a cavalier rejection  of the sound views of the American  people, the consensus of the bipartisan  Iraq Study Group, and the counsel of  wise military commanders.  In a city of some 7 million people,  and without a unified government or  the infrastructure to provide jobs to an  ever more agitated population, an injection of 20,000 troops will not succeed. It can only stoke the flames of  chaos and bloodshed in Iraq.  Our national strategic interests, Mr.  Speaker, require a change of course,  not an escalation. The imperative to  support our troops requires a change of  course, not an escalation.  Last year the Republican-controlled  House declared in the defense authorization bill that 2006 would be a year of  transition to Iraqi control of Iraq, and  that redeployment would begin at that  point. Yet here we are in 2007 with the  administration  calling  for  an  escalation supported by many in this body.  In my judgment, Mr. Speaker, the  time has come and gone for this Congress to say ‘‘enough is enough.’’ The  time has come and gone for statements  of concern. The time has come and  gone for ‘‘trust but verify.’’ The situation in Iraq is dire.  It is now time for this Congress to do  what  the American  people  said  so  clearly in November that they wanted  us to do: Change the course in Iraq. We  have a saying in my home State in New  Hampshire,  ‘‘When you’re  in a hole,  stop digging.’’  Mr. Speaker, I support our valiant  troops, and I oppose the administration’s proposed escalation. I resolve to  work with my colleagues over the coming weeks for a concrete new direction  in Iraq. In the absence of an acceptable  plan from the President, the American  people are calling upon Congress to  lead the way. Popular demand for new  direction in Iraq is, in large part, the  reason I am here in Washington and  the reason Democrats now hold the  majority.  b1545  We can no longer accept empty promises from the administration or hope  the administration will honestly confront the realty of  its  failures. The  American people are looking to this  Congress for leadership. They are impatient. And we must and we will respond.  f  OFF  30  DUST  FROM  CONGRESS  SHOULD  OVERSIGHT  PLAN  YEARS AGO  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  JOHNSONof Georgia). Under a previous  order of the House, the gentleman from  California  (Mr. SCHIFF)  is recognized  for 5 minutes.  ",2007
81,House,110,-0.348,34,2007-01-24,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker, in December 2005, we learned that the Bush administration was using the National  Security Agency, the NSA, to eavesdrop on Americans on U.S. soil without  a warrant or judicial oversight, in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  Over a year later, Congress has yet to  address this issue, and the NSA’s secret  surveillance  program  has  continued  unabated. Just last week the administration  continued  its unilateral approach,  announcing  that  notwithstanding  its protestations  last year,  that it could not possibly allow the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court to oversee the NSA program; it  would now submit to the court’s jurisdiction, but not tell the Congress how  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Court would oversee the program or  why its policies have changed.  When Members  of Congress  questioned the Attorney General and the  National Intelligence Director regarding this shift in policy, both officials  refused to provide information regarding the nature of the administration’s  new policy in this area.  Indeed, we have no idea whether the  administration  is now  seeking warrants on an  individualized basis or  broad programmatic approval from the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court.  Congressional silence in this area and  others has had other  repercussions.  Earlier this month Congress was again  caught by surprise when we  learned  that the President has claimed potentially sweeping new powers to open  Americans’ mail without a court warrant.  Again, the administration could obtain a warrant, and quickly, from a  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court judge, but has chosen not to submit this effort to court supervision. Interestingly, the developments over the  last year bear a striking resemblance  to events that occurred some 30 years  ago, when a series of troubling reports  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:43 Apr 19, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD07\H24JA7.REC H24JA7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007
82,Senate,110,0.7,69,2007-01-24,Mr. DEMINT.," Mr. President, I, too,  would like to speak on the line-item  veto amendment. This body has made a  lot of progress  in being much more  transparent in how we spend America’s  money. We can see, if we look back  over the  last couple of weeks, that  America  appreciates what we  have  tried to do to take these earmarks or  these pet projects or designated spending, whatever we call it, and make it  available for every American to see.  We could tell from our e-mails and letters and the reports in the media that  this was something which made Congress look as if we were genuinely trying to be much more open and honest  about how we spend America’s money.  The amendment before us now, what  we refer to as the line-item veto or  line-item  rescission, would  actually  make this whole process much more  accountable.  I was interested in hearing my colleague make his point that the President could take one good item and put  it with a really bad item and send it  over to us and force us to make a decision. But let’s think about what the  President’s options are now. We can  send thousands of earmarks over in a  bill to the President, and he only has  two choices—to take it or leave it, to  take the whole thing or veto the whole  thing—and work that has been done  here and in the House for months either has to be accepted  in total or  thrown out in total. That doesn’t make  any sense.  I will use the exact argument my colleague did. We should not be able to  package all this good with all this bad  and try to force it down the President’s  throat without the ability to have the  checks and balances, the discussions  that are needed so the American people  can  see we have  thoroughly vetted  these ideas and we are spending their  money wisely.  This line-item rescission package I  support because this Congress needs  the interaction with the President and  the working relationship that would be  caused by this particular bill. It allows  the President, no more than four times  a year, to go through our spending bills  and to send those things back which he  thinks are not national priorities. This  is not real complicated. He does not  veto what we send him; he just gets a  recommendation  in the process. And  since his agencies  in  the executive  branch are charged with carrying this  out  and  spending  this money,  the  President needs to be engaged in the  process  in more  than a  take-it-or-  leave-it  type of  relationship. So no  more than four times a year, the President can put  together  those  things  which he thinks are not national priorities and send them to the Congress.  And all this bill does is guarantee that  they get a vote.  If the President tries to use this  against  individual Members,  I know  this body well enough to know that we  are not going to pass his request.  Any President that tries to do that  for political purposes will find his rescission  package,  or  that  his  recommendations to Congress will be dispensed with very quickly.  This is important not only for this  President but for many Presidents in  the future. We know as Senators and  Congressmen that over the next several  decades this country  is going to be  faced with incredible fiscal crises. We  have no idea how we are going to pay  for Medicare and Medicaid in the future or Social Security. It is going to  become more  important  every year  that we cut wasteful spending and that  we work with the President and with  the House to do everything we can to  cut  those  things  that are not necessary.  In many bills—and we know it happens—many items, earmarks, are voted  on for political reasons, and it is a good  idea to allow the President to package  those things and send them back to us  so that we can vote on them and move  them out if they are not national priorities.  This is not dissimilar at all to the  BRAC process we created to eliminate  unnecessary military bases. We found  that Congressmen and Senators were  not going to vote on an individual basis  to eliminate a base in one State because we knew that then the Congressmen or Senators could vote to eliminate one in our State. It was a political  dilemma that caused us for years to  leave bases open that should have been  closed.  It is the same with Federal programs  and  spending year  after year. One  project might be in my State and one  in another Senator’s State. None of us  are willing to step up and eliminate  projects one at a time. We cannot vote  on them that way. This line-item rescission opportunity is for the President to take those things that we know  are not national priorities, put them in  a package, and send them back over for  us to vote on. We should not lose this  opportunity.  We need the President working with  the Congress  to  eliminate wasteful  spending—not this year or next year  but for decades to come. This may be  our only opportunity in a long time to  make it happen. We have made tremendous progress on identifying the problems with corruption, wasteful spending, identifying earmarks, and all this  VerDate Aug 31 2005  23:55 Jan 24, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G24JA6.019 S24JAPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

86,Senate,110,0.495,83,2007-01-24,Mr. VITTER.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of this amendment No. 110. It  is very simple, very straightforward,  very basic, but also very important. It  is to reduce, in a meaningful way, the  excessive  paperwork  burden  facing  small businesses.  As I begin, I also want to thank Senfor cosponsoring this  amendment. As have I, he has  long  been at work on this issue and has offered great leadership. I thank him for  joining with me in this effort.  Businesses  face  enormous  hurdles  and obstacles and challenges, particularly  small  business. Unfortunately,  one of them has become the enormous  paperwork burden created by all levels  of government. A small business  in  Louisiana, depending on the nature and  location of the business, has to deal  with myriad Federal agencies. Just off  the top of my head, these include the  EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  Coast Guard, SBA, Labor, Commerce,  IRS, and Customs, to name a few. That  doesn’t  include—and my amendment  doesn’t pertain  to—all of  the State  agencies with which  they  similarly  have to deal and  file paperwork because of regulations from local entities  at the governmental level.  The  compounded  effect of  this  is  enormous. All of those requirements,  paperwork and others, can be absolutely  suffocating. There  has  been  some quantification of this enormous  compliance cost. In September 2005, the  SBA Office of Advocacy  released a  study that gave us a glimpse into this.  It said businesses with fewer than 20  employees spend more than $7,600 per  employee just to comply with Federal  regulations. That is a staggering cost.  To a truly small business that doesn’t  have a vice president in charge of compliance, doesn’t have a team of lawyers  or a team of paper filers in the back office to take care of it, that is a real  burden. It distracts the principals of  the business from doing what they set  out to do, the main focus and mission  of the business.  All too often, the way those regulations and requirements are administered  is  in the tone of a  ‘‘gotcha’’  game, fining small businesses for paperwork  violations  just  to  say  ‘‘gotcha,’’ just for the sake of doing it,  of issuing those violations and in some  cases of gaining revenue for the department of government. All of that  is  wrong, and we need to change it.  Nobody here—myself included—is arguing that we don’t need a legitimate  layer of regulation to protect and promote health and safety, the environment, worker safety, et cetera. Nobody  is arguing against that. That is not  what we are talking about. What we  are talking about today is an amendment I offer on the minimum wage bill  which includes provisions I introduced  separately as the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2007. I thank Mr.  NEUGEBAUERof Texas in the House for  introducing identical companion legislation, as we both did in the last Congress. Again, this  is basic, straightforward, simple, but very important to  small business.  This is exactly how it would work. It  would direct Federal agencies not to  impose civil fines for a first-time violation of their agency’s paperwork requirements by a small business unless  the head of the agency determines the  following: the violation has the potential to cause serious harm to the public  interest; not issuing a fine may impair  criminal investigations; the violation  is a violation of Internal Revenue law;  the violation is not corrected within 6  months; or the violation presents a  danger to public health or safety. In  addition,  the amendment  says  that  fines can be waived in the case of a violation that could potentially present a  danger,  if the violation  is corrected  within 24 hours of the small business  receiving notification of the violation.  It is important that the first list of  those possibilities are mandatory. An  agency can’t issue civil fines for a first-  time violation unless one of  those  things happens. But the second part of  it—fines can be waived unless corrected  within  24 hours—is discretionary. A  fine doesn’t have to be waived in that  instance by  the appropriate Federal  regulatory agency.  This is very constrained, very limited, very common sense. Again, the  most important part of the provision  is, it is first-time violations. It is a  small business.  It  is civil penalties  only. We are not talking criminal. We  are not talking a big business with a  big compliance  section. We are not  talking a mandatory waiving of fines  for health and safety violations where  it goes to public health.  This is not only a reasonable thing to  do, it is long overdue considering the  enormous compliance costs I alluded to  before—$7,600 per worker for a small  business of 20 employees or less—just  to take care of Federal requirements.  That doesn’t count State or local. We  are only dealing with Federal because  we are the Federal legislature.  This bill is particularly relevant to  my home following the devastation of  Hurricanes Rita  and Katrina.  The  small business base in Louisiana was  devastated by those horrific events. In  many areas, small businesses are starting from scratch, and the whole community of small businesses is starting  from scratch as it begins to recover  from that destruction. Particularly in  that context, they need this sort of  reasonable relief—limited, focused civil  fines only, first-time violations only,  small business only, only mandatory  waiver when it doesn’t involve a threat  to public health and safety, all of the  very strenuous and carefully outlined  requirements I set out.  I hope everybody in this Chamber can  come together to support this commonsense proposal. In a broader vein, I  hope this is a part—not the only element but a part—of our coming together to pass a minimum wage  increase with small business regulatory  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:57 Jan 25, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24JA6.014 S24JAPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

88,Senate,110,0.439,104,2007-01-24,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, I  regret that I was unable to vote the  evening of January 18 on a very significant amendment offered by my colleague  from Utah. During  consideration of S. 1 last week, I was concerned  with  section  220 of  the bill, which  would have severely undermined the  ability of Americans to be  informed  about what is happening here in the  Capitol and, thereby, to petition the  Congress with their thoughts.  I applaud Senator BENNETT for offering his  amendment to strike these so-called  grassroots  lobbying  provisions  from  the ethics reform bill, and I thank Senate Republican Leader MCCONNELLand  Senator BENNETT for their leadership  in ensuring this amendment’s success.  I ask that the RECORDreflect that, had  I been here, I would have voted in favor  of Senator BENNETT’s amendment No.  20 last Thursday night.  Additionally, I applaud the Senate’s  careful consideration and passage of S.  1,  the Legislative Transparency and  Accountability Act. Although I was unable to attend the vote on final passage  of S. 1, I support the bill and hope that  a conference to resolve differences between the House and Senate passed  bills is convened soon. Scandals involving lobbyists and members of Congress  from both sides of the aisle have shaken the American public’s confidence in  Congress’s ability to do business objectively and judiciously. Although S. 1  fails to address transparency  for so-  called 527 organizations and  fails to  provide the President the authority to  veto wasteful pork projects, passage of  this bill is an important step toward  broadening transparency in the legislative process, and  I  look  forward to  sending a balanced bill to the President’s desk. I ask that the RECORDreflect that, had I been here, I would  have voted for the bill, just as I voted  for a  similar ethics  reform bill on  March 29, 2006.  f  HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES  CAPTAINBRIANFREEMAN  ",2007
89,Senate,110,-0.328,104,2007-01-24,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, a month  ago, I traveled to Iraq to meet there  with our men and women in uniform.  One soldier in particular stood out to  me, a bright young West Point graduate, CPT Brian Freeman. Our conversation  lasted  for no more than 5  minutes, and yet I was immediately  struck by his outspoken intelligence.  ‘‘Senator, it is nuts over here. Soldiers  are being asked to do work we’re not  trained to do,’’ he told me. ‘‘I’m doing  work that State Department people are  far more prepared to do in fostering democracy, but they’re not allowed to  come off the bases because it’s too dangerous  here.  It  doesn’t make  any  sense.’’  Now those words have taken on a  tragic resonance. Four days ago, according to media accounts, 30 gunmen  disguised as U.S. officials penetrated  an Iraqi checkpoint in Karbala. Once  inside the Army compound, the reports  say,  they opened  fire and mortally  wounded five American soldiers.  On Sunday, Charlotte Freeman was  visiting her family in Utah when she  found a message on her cell phone.  Army chaplains had been to her house  in California. The daily e-mails from  her husband Brian had stopped. I imagine that few things have more anguish  in them than waiting,  in suspended  fear,  for the news of a  loved one’s  death. Late that afternoon, the news  came.  So I rise to honor Captain Freeman  and to add my voice to his family’s  prayers. His giving spirit and his self-  sacrifice embodied all the best of our  Armed Forces, whether he was working  to take the son of a Karbala policeman  to America for heart surgery or fighting to secure death benefits  for the  family of his murdered interpreter or  organizing a charity to fund medical  care for Iraqi children. In his duty as a  liaison between the Army and the Government  of  Karbala  Province,  he  proved every day his dedication to the  Iraqi people; the Governor of Karbala  praised him as ‘‘a soldier and a statesman.’’  But  the virtues we  saw  in Brian  shone through even clearer to those  who loved him: Charlotte, his wife; his  3-year-old  son Gunnar  and  his  14-  month-old daughter Ingrid; his father  Randy and his stepmother Kathy; his  mother and his stepfather, Kathleen  and Albert Snyder. ‘‘Brian is a beautiful man,’’ his mother-in-law, Ginny  Mills, wrote to me shortly after his  death.  ‘‘He is loving, funny, and intelligent.  He had a spirit in him that saw the  good in life. A man who put his life on  the line to help those less fortunate  than himself. A man who was a loving  husband and a devoted father. A man  whose daughter will never know him  first-hand.’’  In the place of a husband and father  who will never see his children grow  up, Brian Freeman’s young family will  have to live on with the warm memories of the man who loved them and  who risked his life in the service of his  country. Memories and words of comfort are so insufficient, so small, next  to the flesh and blood. But there is  nothing else to put in their place.  I have nothing else to add—except to  note that the scenes of grief and comfort in the home of Charlotte Freeman  have played themselves out, in some  form or another, 3,000 times, in 3,000  families, for 3,000 lives. ‘‘Each story is  the same,’’ wrote Ginny Mills. ‘‘A wonderful, beautiful soul sacrificed.’’  ‘‘I cannot understand that this war  goes on and on,’’ she wrote. ‘‘It has to  stop. It has to stop now and I need to  know how to do that.’’  May God send comfort to her and to  all of Captain Freeman’s family and to  every family that is bereaved. And may  we remember, in every hour of our deliberations, the young lives that bear  the burden of the choices we make in  this Chamber.  f  COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL  RESOURCES  RULES  OF  PROCEDURE  ",2007

",2007
92,Senate,110,-0.203,125,2007-01-24,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President, today  there are 91,555 members of the National Guard and our Reserve armed  forces serving bravely in Iraq, Afghanistan, and any other part of the world  our country calls them to serve. The  President  is  sending  an  additional  21,500 troops to Iraq in one final push  to bring stability to that country. Regardless of what we think about this  plan, Americans stand by our troops.  They have  the best equipment and  training for their mission and we would  never deny  them  the  support  they  need. But back at home, there is still a  great deal that we can do to support  our guard and reserves families.  When guardsmen and reservists are  deployed  they  leave  their  families,  their jobs, and their communities behind, causing tremendous stress on the  home front and in the workplace. Families often lose the main bread winner  when a citizen soldier gets deployed.  They may have trouble paying bills,  the rent, the mortgage, or buying medicine for their children.  The  reason  these  families  cannot  make ends meet is because for Guardsmen and Reservists military pay  is  often less than civilian pay. We call  that the ‘‘pay gap.’’ According to the  most recent Status Forces Survey of  Reserve Components, 51 percent of our  citizen soldiers take a pay cut when  they get deployed and 11 percent of  them lose more than $2,500 per month.  To help provide relief from the pay  gap for our Guard and Reserve, I am  pleased to introduce, along with Senators DURBIN, GRAHAMand KERRY, the  Helping Our Patriotic Employers at  Helping our Military Employees Act of  2007. I call the bill by its nickname:  HOPE at HOME. Our guard and reserve  families have enough to worry about  when a loved one gets called away, the  least we can do is relieve some of their  financial worry by encouraging employers to make up the pay gap. Let  me describe for my colleagues how this  legislation works.

93,Senate,110,-0.03,132,2007-01-24,Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.," Mr. President, first of all, I thank the senior  Senator from Virginia for his considerable work in drafting this resolution  and working over the weekend with us  and our staffs, who worked very closely  together to prepare this Iraq resolution.  I think it is important to say as well  that I respect the work done by the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee  today  in  considering  the  resolution  submitted by, supported by their chairman, the distinguished Senator from  Delaware, ",2007
94,Senate,110,-0.314,132,2007-01-24,Mr. BIDEN.," I have a great  deal of  respect  for Senator BIDEN’s  work.  This is an area where there can be  more than one idea about how to approach something, but at the end of the  day, it is going to be important to have  a resolution that has broad bipartisan  support.  I also appreciate the work of Senator  COLLINS, who, as our colleague, has  worked very closely on this resolution  together with her staff to be able to  submit it today in this fashion by putting it not only into the RECORDbut on  the floor so it can become part of the  business of the Senate.  There will be some who would say:  Why is there a need for a second resolution? Well, this resolution offers a new  set of ideas, more broadly worded, and  in some cases, clearly, more likely to  be bipartisan for Senators to consider.  Given the fact that the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee resolution came  out on  largely a partisan vote, we  think  this  resolution, because  it  is  picking up bipartisan support, will be,  in terms of content and support, consistent with an effort to bring about a  bipartisan resolution with broad support.  The  recommendations of  the  Iraq  Study Group have not been followed to  any significant extent to date. In some  respects, they have been almost on a  skyhook  for  future consideration.  It  was our feeling that many of these recommendations of the Baker-Hamilton  study group should be included in a  resolution, and we included many of  those recommendations in the body of  our resolution.  We also worked very carefully  to  avoid political rhetoric or any kind of  rhetoric that threatens the real objective. The real objective of this resolution is to stress to the White House  that we disagree with the approach  this plan takes by putting more men  and women in our uniform in harm’s  way to fight, to do battle, to overcome  the sectarian violence and the possible  civil war of the Sunnis and the Shias  and various subgroups within those religious and political elements. We also  believed  it was  important  to  stress  benchmarks and to empower the Prime  Minister and the Iraqi Government to  be able to meet certain objectives, certain goals, and to be able to deliver.  At the end of the day, we think it is  important to send a strong but unified  message to the White House and Iraq.  The more support the resolution receives in the Senate, the stronger our  message will be. So tonight I am very  pleased and am certainly proud to be  here with my colleagues to say that at  the  end of  the day, we  think  the  strength of this resolution to uphold  our responsibility will be in the best  interests of our country and our military and that our colleagues should  join together with us in opposition to  the surge of U.S. troops to be placed in  Baghdad. It is the responsibility of the  Iraqi Government and the Iraqi military to overcome the battles between  sectarian  groups within  their  own  country and to seek less of a military  resolution and certainly more of a political resolution to the problems that  exist at the present time.  With that, let me say that I would  like to see our unanimous consent be  modified to include up to 10 minutes  for Senator SALAZAR from Colorado to  speak on the resolution afterward, if  there is no objection.  ",2007
95,Senate,110,0.262,132,2007-01-24,Mr. WARNER.," Mr. President, I certainly will not object. I wonder if I  might have 2 minutes following Senator COLLINS to summarize before we  receive the distinguished Senator from  Colorado for his remarks. I ask unanimous consent that the unanimous consent agreement be modified so I can  have about 2 minutes.  ",2007

Judge  Monk currently presides as Circuit Judge of  the Seventh Judicial Circuit in Anniston, Alabama.  Judge Sam Monk graduated from the University of Alabama School of Law  in 1975.  Prior to law school, Judge Monk served in the  United States Army. Judge Monk has worked  in both private practice and has served as  Presiding Judge  for  the 7th Judicial Circuit,  Circuit Judge for the 7th Judicial Circuit, and  as District Judge  for Calhoun and Cleburne  Counties.  Judge Monk will officially retire on January  15, 2007, but a reception in his honor will be  held on January 12, 2007 at  the Calhoun  County Courthouse.  I salute Judge Monk and congratulate him  on his service to the legal field over the past  28 years. I wish him all the best on this important occasion.  f  ACADEMY NOMINEES FOR 2007  HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 24, 2007  ",2007
98,,110,0.29,195,2007-01-24,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Madam Speaker,  every year, more high school seniors from the  11th Congressional District  trade  in varsity  jackets  for Navy pea coats, Air Force  flight  suits, and Army brass buckles than most other  districts  in  the country. But  this  is nothing  new—our area has repeatedly sent an above  average portion of its sons and daughters to  the nation’s military academies for decades.  This  fact should not come as a surprise.  The educational excellence of area schools is  well known and has long been a magnet for  families  looking  for  the best environment  in  which  to raise  their children. Our graduates  are skilled not only in mathematics, science,  and social studies, but also have solid backgrounds  in sports, debate  teams, and other  extracurricular activities. This diverse upbringing makes military academy recruiters sit up  and take note—indeed, many recruiters know  our towns and schools by name.  Since  the 1830’s, Members of Congress  have enjoyed meeting, talking with, and nominating these superb young people to our military academies. But how did  this process  evolve?  In 1843, when West Point was  the  sole academy, Congress  ratified  the nominating process and became directly involved  in the makeup of our military’s leadership. This  was not an act of an imperial Congress bent  on controlling every aspect of Government.  Rather,  the procedure still used  today was,  and is, a further check and balance in our democracy. It was originally designed to weaken  and divide political coloration  in  the officer  corps, provide geographical balance  to our  armed services, and to make the officer corps  more  resilient  to  unfettered  nepotism  and  handicapped European armies.  In 1854, Representative Gerritt Smith of  New York added a new component  to  the  academy nomination process—the academy  review board. This was the first time a Member of Congress appointed prominent citizens  from his district to screen applicants and assist with the serious duty of nominating candidates for academy admission. Today, I am  honored to continue this wise tradition in my  service to the 11th Congressional District.  The Academy Review Board is composed of  six local citizens, several of whom are distinguished veterans, who have shown exemplary  service to New Jersey, to their communities,  and to the continued excellence of education  in our area. Though from diverse backgrounds  and professions,  they all share a common  dedication  that  the best qualified and motivated graduates attend our academies. And,  as true for most volunteer groups, their service  goes largely unnoticed.  I would like to take a moment to recognize  these men and women and thank them publicly  for participating  in  this  important panel.  Being on the Board requires hard work and an  objective mind. Members have the responsibility of interviewing upwards of 50 outstanding  high school seniors every year in the academy  review process.  The nomination process  follows a general  timetable. High school seniors mail personal  information directly  to  the Military Academy,  the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy,  and the Merchant Marine Academy once they  become interested in attending. Information includes academic achievement, college entry  test scores, and other activities. At this time,  they also inform my office of their desire to be  nominated.  The academies then assess the applicants,  rank them based on the data supplied, and return the files to my office with their notations.  In late November, our Academy Review Board  interviews all of the applicants over the course  of two days. They assess a student’s qualifications and analyze character, desire to serve,  and other  talents  that may be hidden on  paper.  This year  the board  interviewed 38 applicants. Nominations included 19 to the Naval  Academy, 9 to the Military Academy and 5 to  the Air Force Academy—the Coast Guard  Academy does not use  the Congressional  nomination  process. The  recommendations  are then forwarded to the academies by January 31, where admissions staff reviewed files  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:08 Jan 25, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A24JA8.022 E24JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 1 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

I thank both Senators.  As we prepare to discuss the war in  Iraq, I would like to take a couple of  minutes to discuss the issue of personal  responsibility, civility, and the role of  American diplomacy.  Since the founding of our great Nation, we have had a long and proud tradition of international diplomacy. Our  diplomacy  has  taken many  forms,  whether it is through official state visits or through  less  formal channels,  such as congressional delegations traveling to individual countries. What we  all need to remember is that when we  are on a trip to a foreign country, we  act as American diplomats.

102,Senate,110,-0.199,51,2007-02-01,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, In reflection of the New Year, I have thought  about what I wanted my New Year’s  resolution to be. I had a wonderful holiday that I was fortunate to spend with  my family, and I thought about those  in the world who did not have that  same opportunity. World peace is our  ambition, but, today I want to speak  about  our  hope  for  the  people  of  Darfur, Sudan.  I rise to add my voice, and that of my  constituency, on the crisis in Darfur.  Everyday I hear from Arkansans concerned about the escalating chaos and  destruction  happening  in  Darfur.  Whether it is through church groups,  schools, the newspaper, Internet, or the  television, the reports from Darfur are  shocking  and  disturbing.  Darfur,  Sudan, is 7,117 miles away from Little  Rock, AR, but it is not removed from  the thoughts and prayers of our citizens.  The  statistics  on  this  crisis  are  heartbreaking. It has been estimated  that between 200,000 and 400,000 people  have  been killed  and  thousands  of  women have been raped. Over 2 million  people have been displaced. Their lives  have been completely uprooted, and  their only chance of survival is refugee  camps. These makeshift camps provide  little shelter and are subjected to raids  by armed militias. Aid workers and organizations have recently pulled out of  the region due to safety concerns, and  the conflict is spreading to neighboring  countries,  destabilizing  governments  that may be ill-equipped to integrate  an influx of refugees. Moreover, the Sudanese  government  has  restricted  media and diplomatic access to the region.  While the United States has taken  considerable actions to support an end  to the horrible violence in Darfur, the  situation  continues  to  deteriorate.  Darfur  is the world’s crisis, and we  must do more to ensure that an effective peacekeeping force is in place to  stem the escalating rape, murder, and  destruction.  I am hopeful that the United Nations’ most recent effort will work. I  am encouraged that so many humanitarian organizations have worked tirelessly to find a resolution to this matter. It is my wish that peace and stability will come to Darfur in 2007.  The people of Darfur have been deprived of the most basic of human liberties: the right to live in peace. It is  our responsibility as U.S. Senators, as  Americans, and as humanitarians to do  all that we can to bring about an end  to this world crisis.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  USC-RIVERSIDE CITRUS RESEARCH  CENTER  ∑",2007
103,Senate,110,-0.45,51,2007-02-01,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, today I  ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 100 years of groundbreaking research and education at the University  of California Riverside’s Citrus Research  Center—Agricultural  Experiment Station. This year, the university  celebrates a century of improving our  Nation’s agriculture, environment, and  natural resources.  The idea behind the creation of a citrus experiment center began with the  pioneering work of Riverside  citrus  grower John Henry Reed, who first proposed the idea in 1900. At the time Riverside was the hub of a rapidly expanding citrus industry, in part because refrigeration made nationwide shipments  possible. His proposal became a reality  in 1905 when the California Legislature  passed a measure authorizing the establishment of the Citrus Experiment  Station in Riverside. By 1907, the Citrus Experiment Station  became  an  open branch of the Statewide Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of California.  From that time on, the Citrus Experiment Station continued to grow and  develop, to become one of California’s  premier agricultural research institutions. In 1914, the station maintained a  staff of 18 with an annual budget of  $60,000. Over the next 40 years, the Experiment Station’s research area grew  from 30 acres to almost 1,000 acres, and  staff grew to 265.  During that time, Leon D. Bachelor,  as director, worked to initiate many of  the  long-term  fertilizer  experiments  and worked to ensure the strength of  the walnut  industry through disease  research. During his tenure, shipping  and processing of produce was vastly  improved, and improvements were implemented in citrus rootstocks, disease  resistance, and fruit quality.  While this was taking place, facilities and physical plant construction  continued to increase as more research  stations and research buildings were  being built. In 1954 Weber Hall was constructed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Boyden Entomological Laboratory was built in 1961, and research  property increased to 1,100 acres. There  were also advances in research focus,  beginning in 1955 with the arrival of a  vegetable crops group from UC Davis.  During the next year, the Department  of Nematology and  the Biometrical  Laboratory were  established. Work  also came from UCLA focusing on entomology  and  plant  pathology  on  ornamentals.  Just after this, the Air Pollution Research Center was established on the  UC Riverside campus, and agronomists  from Davis were welcomed to join in  the research efforts. A Dry Lands Research Institute was added in 1963, and  in the year following, the UC Riverside  campus added a Department of Agricultural Engineering. The year after this,  the Department of Agronomy accepted  further work  from UCLA  on  turf  grasses.  With the expansion of research into  all of these areas, it became clear that  the university did not simply research  citrus, and the Citrus Experiment Station was appropriately  renamed  the  Citrus Research Center and Agricultural Experiment Station, CRC–AES,  in 1961. A full college devoted to this  research effort was added in 1974, establishing  the College of Natural and  Agricultrual Sciences.  Today, UC Riverside agricultural and  natural science researchers pave the  way for many of our Nation’s important  scientific advances. Studies  in  plant sciences and environmental and  natural resources continue to improve  the quality of life for our Nation and  our planet. As the Citrus Research Center—Agricultural Experiment Station  at the University of California, Riverside celebrates  its centennial,  I applaud the tremendous efforts and advances and  look  forward to another  century of progress.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO 2006 KENTUCKY  DERBY WINNER BARBARO  ∑",2007

105,Senate,110,-0.352,72,2007-02-01,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, today we  pay our respects to a great son of Massachusetts who passed away on Sunday, an inspiration to me and a leader  beloved  by many,  Father  Robert  Drinan.  In all his life’s endeavors, from the  church pulpit to the halls of Congress  to the classroom, Father Drinan was  guided by a firm and unwavering moral  compass. He lived out in public life the  whole cloth of Catholic teachings.  In religion and politics alike, he followed his sense that we are all put on  this Earth for something greater than  ourselves. Wherever he went, he was  led there by a concern for the weak,  the helpless, the downtrodden. In religion and politics alike, that was his  calling.  And as he walked between  these  worlds, on a path unique in our Nation’s history, he was always unmistakably and wonderfully true to himself.  Father Drinan was a forever gentle,  resilient, tenacious advocate for social  justice and  fundamental decency.  In  the most divisive days of Vietnam,  when things were coming apart, this  incredible man, this most unlikely of  candidates, showed America how a man  of faith could be a man of peace.  As a politician, Father Drinan is best  remembered for his spirited opposition  to  the Vietnam war. That’s what  brought him to Congress in the first  place and  it  is how our paths  first  crossed. In 1970, after we first met as  opponents in the Peoples’ Caucus, I was  honored to support, campaign, and to  work with and learn from committed  Democrats  like  Jerome  Grossman,  John Marttila, Tom Kiley, John Hurley, and Tom Vallely. Together, many  of  these  committed activists would  spend the next decades championing  the  great  progressive  causes  that  marked the Drinan campaign.  Father Drinan’s slogan was ‘‘Father  Knows Best.’’ I began studying law at  Boston College—where Father Drinan  had been the youngest law school Dean  in  the country—while he was down  here,  in Congress, making  law, and  making history.  Father Drinan’s  testimony against  the war was remarkably powerful. He  toured jails in Saigon and met a South  Vietnamese politician there who had  been jailed after placing second in an  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:27 Jul 29, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\S01FE7.REC S01FE 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2007
106,,110,-0.658,79,2007-02-01,Mr. CONYERS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to support House Resolution 58 in honor  of Muhammad Ali—born Cassius Marcellus  Clay, on  the occasion of his 65th birthday.  Internationally known as  the  ‘‘greatest of all  time,’’ he single-handedly  revolutionized  the  sport of boxing.  Born on this day in 1942 in Louisville, KY,  by the age of 18, Clay had already become  the 1960 light-heavyweight Olympic Gold Medalist. It was then that he evolved into a professional fighter, and by 1963, he had won all 19  of his  first professional  fights. The  following  year, 1964, Clay won the world heavyweight  title against Sonny Liston. Two days later, he  announced his acceptance of the teachings of  the Nation of Islam and changed his name to  Muhammad Ali shortly after.  Ali defended his championship  title nine  times between 1965 and 1967, more  than  most heavyweight fighters in such a short period. Citing his  Islamic  faith, Ali  refused  to  serve  in  the U.S. military during  the war  in  Vietnam. As a result, his title was revoked, his  fighting license was suspended, and he was  sentenced to 5 years in prison for draft evasion. He was barred from fighting from March  22, 1967  to October 26, 1970, which many  feel were his peak years. Finally, in 1971, the  Supreme Court unanimously  reversed Ali’s  conviction, and his boxing privileges were restored.  Ali quickly set about regaining  the heavyweight title, which was now held by the indomitable Joe Frazier. In the first of three bouts  with Frazier, Ali  lost what was dubbed  ‘‘the  fight of the century.’’ In a rematch with Frazier  in 1974, Ali was victorious in redeeming his  championship  title.  In October of  that same  year, the fight considered to be his most anticipated and promoted of his career, was the  ‘‘rumble in the jungle’’ against a younger and  vibrant George Foreman. The fight took place  in Kinshasa, Zaire, and there were many who  doubted that Ali would emerge the victor. In  this  fight, Ali  introduced what he called  the  ‘‘rope-a-dope,’’ which he used to tire Foreman  and eventually sustain his position as the No.  1 heavyweight champion of the world.  In 1975, his  third and  final bout with Joe  Frazier, labeled the ‘‘the thrilla in Manila’’ by  Ali, proved  to be one of  the  toughest and  greatest fights of his career. Ali was victorious  once more. Sadly, in 1978, Ali lost the title to  Leon Spinks. That same year, in a rematch  with Spinks, Ali won the championship title for  the third time. In his final fight, ‘‘the drama in  Bahamas,’’ against Trevor Berbick in 1981, his  loss signaled the decline of the fighter’s reign,  and on December 12, 1981, Muhammad Ali  said goodbye  to boxing at  the age of 39.  There were also reports of his deteriorating  health, and in 1982, the world knew that he  was suffering from Parkinson’s disease.  Ali remains a beloved and active public figure. He has enjoyed countless honors, such  as becoming No. 13 of the Forbes Celebrity  100,  receiving  the Spirit of America Award  which named him the most recognized American in the world, named ‘‘Kentucky Athlete of  the Century,’’ and  lighting  the  flame at  the  1996 Summer Olympics. In 2005, Ali received  the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and  the  $60 million Muhammad Ali Center was opened  in his honor in Louisville, KY. He is a United  Nations Messenger of Peace and  the  first  sportsman  to  receive an Otto Hahn Peace  Medal. He is also the namesake of the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act.  More than a superior in the boxing world, Ali  took a stand against  injustice. He was a  champion of the civil rights movement, and an  involved activist who used his power and fame  to push noble social change. His refusal  to  fight in a war that he didn’t believe in made a  statement  to not only  the African-American  community, but to the world. Ali sacrificed boxing, the one thing he loved the most, to stand  up for that which he believed. His practice of  Islam and civil disobedience propelled him to  larger than life status. Muhammad Ali has inspired millions throughout the world. He has  given people hope and proved  that anyone  can overcome  insurmountable odds. He has  given people courage and shown us all that  with spirit and determination, a simple person  can make a difference. There will never be another Muhammad Ali.  So Madam Speaker, it is with great distinction that I stand here today to wish the champ,  the living legend, ‘‘The Greatest,’’ Muhammad  Ali, a happy birthday.

107,,110,-0.187,86,2007-02-01,Mr. COSTA.," Madam Speaker, as co-chair of  the Congressional Victims’ Rights Caucus,  I  rise  today  to  introduce  the 2007 National  Crime Victims’ Rights Week Resolution on behalf of myself and my caucus co-chair, Congressman TEDPOEof Texas. This resolution  expresses Congress’s support of  the goals  and ideals of National Crime Victims’ Rights  Week and the efforts to increase public awareness of  the  rights, needs, and concerns of  crime  victims and  survivors  in  the United  the  States. This observance will  take place  week of April 22 through April 28.  In 1980, President Reagan first called for a  national observance  to recognize and honor  the millions of crime victims and survivors in  America. National Crime Victims’ Rights Week  also pays tribute to the thousands of community-based and system-based victim services  providers and to the criminal justice and allied  professionals who provide critical support and  assistance  to  victims every day, of every  week, of every single year. National Crime  Victims’ Rights Week has since been proclaimed annually with ceremonies and observances in Washington, DC, and in thousands of  communities throughout our Nation.  President Reagan’s strong emphasis on the  rights and needs of crime victims led to the  passage of the Victims of Crime Act, which in  1984 created the Crime Victims Fund. Since  then, the Crime Victims Fund has dedicated  more  than $8 billion collected  from criminal  fines—not  taxpayers’  dollars—that  annually  supports more  than 4,400 victim assistance  programs serving some 3.8 million victims,  and compensation to more than 165,000 victims for their unreimbursed medical expenses,  lost wages and  funeral costs. The adage,  ‘‘crime doesn’t pay, victims do,’’ is challenged  by the VOCA fund, which rightfully holds offenders accountable for their criminal actions,  with fines ensuring that crime victims receive  the services and support they so greatly need  and deserve. And the Congressional Victims’  Rights Caucus has worked since its inception  to preserve  the  intent and  integrity of  the  Crime Victims Fund as created by President  Reagan nearly a quarter century ago.  The 2007 National Crime Victims’ Rights  Week theme is ‘‘Victims’ Rights: Every Victim.  Every Time.’’ Today more  than ever,  these  simple words resonate with greater importance  than ever before. In the decade between 1994  and 2004,  the National Crime Victimization  Survey found that violent crime rates declined,  reaching  the  lowest  level ever  recorded  in  2005. Unfortunately last year, the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports  reported  that crime  is,  once again, on the rise—violent crime rose 3.7  percent; murders increased 1.4 percent; robberies were up nearly 10 percent; and arson  increased by nearly 7 percent. This means  more victims than ever suffer the indignation  of crime, and have significant losses that affect  them physically, emotionally,  financially  and spiritually. Our caucus and our Congress  must  recommit our energies  to ensure  that  ‘‘every victim of every crime’’ has access to  support and services.  I know that my colleagues in Congress have  heard a great deal about violence and victimization, and have heard from those who are  directly affected:  The teenage girl who leaves home for the  first time to go to college, only to be drugged  and raped at a campus party; or the young  mother who is beaten by her husband on a  regular basis, but fears leaving him because  he’s threatened to kill her kids, and she has  no money, nor no place to go.  ‘‘Every victim. Every time.’’  Or  the elderly man—no different  from our  parents—who is abused in a nursing home; or  the parents whose only son is killed in a violent drunk driving crash.  ‘‘Every victim. Every time.’’  Or the horrific day that nobody will ever forget—September 11, 2001—when nearly 3,000  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:28 Apr 19, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD07\E01FE7.REC E01FE7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

109,,110,-0.182,93,2007-02-01,Mr. TANNER.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to  recognize Bill Hiles, who  is  retiring  this  week after working for 23 years as a journalist  at the Dyersburg State Gazette in Dyersburg,  Tennessee. He has proven himself a quality  writer who  fairly, accurately and completely  covers the information that is important to our  community in northwest Tennessee.  Even before coming to the State Gazette,  Bill was a distinguished scholar, journalist and  pastor. He received a Bachelor’s Degree  in  Philosophy at Transylvania College  in Lexington, Kentucky, and a Master’s Degree  in  Systematic Theology  from  the University of  Durham  in Durham, England. He has also  studied  at  Vanderbilt  University  and  the  George Peabody College for Teachers, taught  college—level writing  and  public  relations  courses and, having been ordained as a minister of  the Christian Church, Disciples of  Christ, served as pastor at several churches  throughout Tennessee. After working at  the  Associated Press and United Press  International, Bill was a general assignment  reporter  and  sports  columnist  at The Tennessean  in Nashville, Tennessee, where he  from  future Vice  once sat across  the desk  President Al Gore.  Madam Speaker, it has been a pleasure to  work alongside Bill during his long service to  Tennessee, and  I am proud  to call him my  friend. I hope you and our colleagues will join  Betty Ann and me in thanking Bill Hiles for his  work, congratulating him on his well—earned  retirement and wishing him all the best in the  years to come.  f  THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OF THE  ACADEMY OF MUSIC  HON.

110,,110,-0.472,93,2007-02-01,Mr. FATTAH.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to  recognize  the 150th Anniversary of  the  grand opening of Philadelphia’s Academy of  Music—our  ‘‘Grand Old  Lady  of  Locust  Street.’’ Since January 26, 1857, the Academy  has hosted more than one billion attendees at  almost half a million performances. Generations of the region’s children have sat in her  elegant auditorium and caught their breath as  the curtain rose on their first experience of an  opera or ballet performance. Millions of them  have sat up  in wonder as  they heard The  Philadelphia Orchestra’s  rousing sounds  for  the first time. Hundreds of thousands of Philadelphians have walked proudly across  the  Academy’s stage to accept their commencement certificate. Audiences and artists alike  have flocked to Philadelphia from around the  world because of the Academy of Music.–  What a  remarkable  legacy  for one building—a  legacy  that has a deeply personal  meaning for many generations of the region’s  families who share memories of attending special events within her walls; a legacy that laid  the foundation on which the city created the  Avenue of the Arts, built the shining new Kimmel Center, and made Philadelphia one of the  most vibrant cultural destinations in the world;  a legacy of which all Philadelphia—area residents can be proud.  The Academy of Music 150th Anniversary  Concert and Ball, held on January 27, 2007,  reflected many facets of the Academy’s rich  history. World—renowned artists host Tom  Brokaw, soprano Deborah Voigt,  tenor Ben  Heppner and  vocalists  John Lithgow, with  Music Director Christoph Eschenbach and our  own celebrated Philadelphia Orchestra and  Philadelphia  Singers,  presented  an  outstanding program of grand opera,  theater,  Broadway, classical and popular music.  The concert was attended by over 2,400 of  the region’s political, civic and corporate leaders as well as special guests Their Royal  Highnesses  the Prince of Wales and  the  Duchess of Cornwall. Even the Prince’s visit  has a historical precedent  in  the Academy’s  rich past: his great, great grandfather, Edward  VII, was one of the early visiting dignitaries to  grace the Academy at a gala performance by  the popular soprano Adelina Patti in 1860. The  Prince of Wales will sit  in  the same box,  dubbed ‘‘the Prince of Wales Box’’ since the  1860 visit  that his ancestor occupied before  him.  I congratulate the Academy on its sesquicentennial and  look  forward  to many more  years of important cultural contributions to our  city.

112,House,110,0.392,6,2007-02-14,Ms. GRANGER.," Mr. Speaker, on Sunday afternoon, I drove about 20 miles  to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Paul  Balint in Willow Park, Texas. I had the  solemn honor of presenting them with  congressional remarks commemorating  the noble and distinguished service of  their son, Paulie.  The parents of Captain Balint did not  complain to me or ask me to vote to  end the war. They talked about the  pride of their son and his lifetime desire to serve in the military.  The Balints have never waffled  in  their belief that the war in Iraq is one  that demands our Nation’s full commitment. They experienced a loss no  one ever wants to share. Paulie was  fighting to preserve our freedom and  our way of life.  As I wished them well and turned to  leave, the Balints asked me to bring a  message back  to Washington. They  said to tell you to stay firm because we  need to finish the job in Iraq.  So I am speaking today in memory of  Paulie and his mother and his father  and his brother and those who are still  fighting there for us and listening to  what we have to say.  I will not speak by calling into question anyone’s patriotism or motives.  All of us, Republicans and Democrats  alike, recognize that much is at stake  in Iraq and, undoubtedly, we all feel  passionately about doing our duty to  move forward and address what I consider to be the issue of our lives, the  worldwide war against terrorists and a  battleground of that war, which is Iraq.  The  issue of responsibility  in this  war has been discussed during this debate, and I believe it is an important  issue when addressing Iraq and in addressing this resolution.  b1045  Certainly in the change of direction  the President has presented, the Iraqis  have a clear responsibility to meet the  goals of  securing  their own  future.  Likewise, Congress has a clear responsibility to produce meaningful legislation and provide effective oversight of  our government’s actions, especially  during time of war.  Put another way, our citizens hold  their elected Representatives accountable to craft legislation that results in  meaningful and positive change. That  is precisely what is so disappointingly  unacceptable  about  this  nonbinding  bill, which fails to do anything, which  holds no one accountable, and does not  move our country forward on this critical issue.  Frankly, those many who have criticized the administration  for staying  the course too long are now presenting  us with a bill that is the  ‘‘stay the  course’’ piece of legislation that both  advocates failure and a position of status quo. More specifically, the bill ignores two of the most important parts  of our Nation’s role in Iraq: the consequences of failure and the principal  support that we should provide our  troops during times of war.  Let us say we do redeploy, which  means quit. Or let us say the Congress  takes the next step that is being talked  about, and that is stopping the funding  in Iraq. Let us look clearly at the consequences of a failed state in Iraq, not  only for America but for the world.  Let there be no mistake, Iraq is but  one front in a long war against a fanatical enemy who does not value human  life and who seeks to destroy those who  do. Failing to secure Iraq will result in  massive instability in the Middle East,  which will undoubtedly spill over to  the rest of the world.  Consider the fractured nature of the  Middle East and the nature of the dangerous threat we  face.  Iranian television  stations  routinely  broadcast  commercials that are designed to recruit would-be terrorists. In one ad specifically  for children, cartoon characters entice them to be suicide bombers.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the  gentleman  from  Maryland  (Mr.  GILCHREST), himself a former Marine,  always a Marine, who served during  Vietnam and was wounded  for  this  country.  ",2007
114,House,110,0.32,20,2007-02-14,Ms. PRYCE of Ohio.," I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I especially  thank you for your leadership on the  floor through this very important debate, a hard debate for us here in the  House of Representatives and a hard  debate for this country.  But, Mr. Speaker, a new plan is being  implemented, a new plan with political, economic and military components. Reinforcements are on their way  even as we speak. The Iraqis do need to  do their part, we know that. President  Maliki tells us that they will. And if  we reinforce now, they will take  it  over. They will stand up because they  must, and then we will come home.  Mr. Speaker, not everyone believes  that this is a good plan. It is sophisticated, it is comprehensive, but not everyone agrees that it is the right plan,  and I understand that.  This war certainly hasn’t achieved  its intended results. The President said  ‘‘stay the course,’’ and some said no.  The President now says, ‘‘change the  course,’’ and the same folks say no.  That’s fair; we have room in this great  Nation to disagree. But if that is the  case, that you don’t want to stay the  course or change the course, then use  the tools and the powers available to  you to stop the course.  The tools are at your disposal, the  power of the purse to defund the effort.  You  could  repeal  the  authorization  that most of us voted for this in 2002.  You could require troop withdrawal.  You have that power and you have that  right.

118,House,110,-0.553,48,2007-02-14,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, this is  the moment that a majority of Americans who voted  last November have  been waiting for, a time when Congress  does something about Iraq. And that  something that the people asked of us  is to get us out of Iraq.  The resolution before us will not of  itself get U.S. forces out of Iraq, but to  paraphrase Winston Churchill, if it is  not the end, it is at least the beginning  of the end.  Our President is having trouble understanding  the message  from  the  American people. It is a simple message that I hear every time I go back  home to Minnesota. Time to bring our  troops home with honor. The people  are telling me our mission in Iraq is accomplished. The President already declared victory. The goals of the U.S. invasion have been met.  Iraq’s army was defeated, Saddam  Hussein  removed  from  power  and  brought to judgment. The Iraqi people  held elections to establish a new government. Mission accomplished. Time  to bring the troops home with honor.  No weapons of mass destruction were  found, despite extensive searches. The  Iraqis have a government, they have an  army, a police force. There is no further purpose of American policy to be  served by a continued military presence in Iraq.  What  remains  in  Iraq  is  religious  warfare between Sunni and Shia, with  our troops caught in the crossfire. This  is not the job our troops signed up for.  This is not the war President Bush sold  to Congress. People are  telling  the  President, it is time to bring the troops  home and to do it with honor.  President Bush has said he is concerned this resolution is prejudging the  outcome of our involvement in Iraq. I  would say the outcome is not in doubt.  We have spent and are continuing to  spend $9 billion a month in Iraq; 3,122  of our servicemen and  -women have  been  killed;  23,550-plus  have  been  wounded; tens of thousands more Iraqis  killed and wounded. The violence is escalating, our troops are the targets.  I do not think this resolution prejudges anything. The facts speak for  themselves. And the people are saying  bring the troops home with honor. I did  not support this war at its outset. We  had Saddam Hussein  contained. Al  Qaeda was not in Iraq. We had a job to  do in Afghanistan. I supported going  into Afghanistan to capture Osama bin  Laden. But I saw no clear rationale for  sending troops into combat in Iraq.  The resolution does offer a statement  of support for the troops. Their service  is an extraordinary gift. They volunteer to leave their homes and families  and risk their lives every day, at the  order of the President. All they ask is  that we never ask them to go to conflict unless that conflict is absolutely  necessary and in the national interest.  Lieutenant General William Odom,  in a recent article in The Washington  Post said, about the question that we  have to continue to fight in order to  support the troops, has anyone asked  the troops? During their  first tours,  many may have  favored staying the  course. But now in their second, third,  fourth  tours,  he writes, many  are  changing their minds.  We see no evidence of that in the  news  stories  about unhappy  troops  being sent back to Iraq. The strangest  aspect of the rationale, General Odom  writes, for continuing the war is the  implication that our troops are somehow responsible  for deciding to continue the President’s course.  That political and moral responsibility belongs to the President, not to  the troops. Didn’t Harry Truman make  it clear that the buck stops in the Oval  Office? The President keeps dodging it.  Where does it stop, General Odom asks,  with Congress? And that is why we are  here today to say it is up to us to make  a definitive statement with this resolution, a statement that it is time to end  the U.S. involvement in Iraq, to bring  the troops home with honor. And then  if the President does not heed, then we  must take more vigorous steps, steps  that I voted for in coming to end the  U.S. involvement in Vietnam over 32  years ago.  If that is what it takes, then we have  to say that the buck stops with us in  the Congress to stop the U.S. engagement in Iraq.  ANNOUNCEMENTBYTHESPEAKERPROTEMPORE  ",2007

Those of us who were elected in 1994  and had the opportunity to know CHARLIE, to work with CHARLIE, and for me  personally I had the opportunity to sit  next to him on the Energy and Commerce Committee  for about 8 years,  CHARLIEwas many things. He was a  soldier in Vietnam, he was a businessman, he was a dentist, he was a great  United States Congressman. He also  was a Sunday school teacher at Trinity  on the Hill Methodist Church in Augusta, Georgia. And I know that that  church meant a lot to him because he  is asking for donations to that church  as a memorial.  Recently I attended a church service  in a Methodist church  in Kentucky,  and the title of the sermon was ‘‘You  Can’t Make a Success of Life Without  Making a Gift of It.’’ And when I think  that  is  really  what I think about: He made a gift of  his life. We will miss him. He has made  a tremendous impact on all of us. We  wish his family the very best.  ",2007
121,House,110,0.467,55,2007-02-14,Mr. CARTER.," I thank you for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about  my friend, CHARLIENORWOOD. I have  prepared remarks, but I would really  like to just relate like others have.  The first time I ran into CHARLIE I  was a new freshman in this body. He  sat behind me. And when you are brand  new here, you are listening and you are  trying to figure out what is going on.  And when CHARLIENORWOODopened his  mouth, he was saying things sometimes that others were not, and stood  his ground to those things, even though  they might be in conflict with both the  other side and his party, both. CHARLIE  had a way of standing up for his principles.  NORWOOD CHARLIENORWOOD I also want to talk about Gloria, because Gloria took my wife under her  wing and was kind to her. And I can  tell you for this last year and a half,  literally every week that I have served  in this Congress, my wife has asked  about CHARLIE’s health because she fell  in love with Gloria Norwood.  Everyone  in this House sends out  their hearts to Gloria at the loss of her  beloved husband. We were proud  to  serve with him. He was a great American.  Today  I rise  to honor my  friend and colleague Mr. CHARLIE from Northeastern Georgia who passed away yesterday  morning. As a man of strong character and  unwavering convictions, his passing is surely a  saddening loss to the American people.  CHARLIENORWOOD served as a brave soldier during Vietnam as part of the Army Dental  Corps in the 173rd Airborne Brigade. He was  honored for his courageous service with the  Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars.  Elected to Congress in 1994, CHARLIEwas  the  first Republican  to  represent his Northeastern Georgia district since Reconstruction.  During his time in Congress he was known for  his endless fight for the patients’ bill of rights  and his fight for stricter immigration policies.  CHARLIEbravely battled cancer and lung disease, and in his final days he returned to Augusta to be with his family. The Norwood family will be in my thoughts and prayers. Please  join me, Mr. Speaker, in expressing our deep  appreciation  for  the  lifetime of  service by  and extending our sympathies to his wife, Gloria Wilkinson Norwood,  and their family.  ",2007
122,House,110,0.435,55,2007-02-14,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  express deep sorrow at the passing of  real CHARLIENORWOOD our friend and colleague, CHARLIENORWOOD. While most of us hope to make a  difference in this world, CHARLIENORWOODcertainly did that. He also made  a difference in the lives of those who  were fortunate enough to have known  him.  CHARLIEwas steadfast and did what  he thought was right. He was an immovable object in the defense of principle, and when met with irresistible  force, it wasn’t likely that CHARLIEwas  the one who was moved.  During the development of the Medicare  prescription  drug  benefit,  I  worked closely with CHARLIEand several of my colleagues to see if there  was an alternative plan and how we  were going to work this out. CHARLIE’s  contributions were  insightful,  they  were valuable, and added considerably  to the worth of our final product. During that process, he was constantly  mindful of two things, and that was the  need to help seniors who had no drug  coverage and the need to be wise stewards for taxpayers.  Coming to Congress with a medical  background, CHARLIEprovided a point  of view that enhanced any debate he  entered. While witnesses before him, at  the Health Subcommittee may have  cringed at times under his questioning,  the responses that were drawn out always added an important dimension to  our debates.  will be  sorely missed:  in  Congress, in the Health Subcommittee,  but more importantly in all our lives. I  give my deepest sympathies to his wife,  Gloria, his sons Charles and Carlton,  and his constituents.  ",2007

To Gloria, to the family, we extend  our most sincere, deepest condolences.  Kathy and I will keep you in our prayers.  I just want to tell one short story  about CHARLIE. When we came  into  Congress together back in 1994 and we  had the Contract With America, the  first 100 days, one of the very  first  votes that we had was H.R. 1. That was  an amendment to the Constitution to  balance  the budget.  I was  standing  right back here at the voting machine  beside  I  voted  ‘‘yes.’’ CHARLIE put his card  in, he  voted ‘‘yes,’’ and he turned to me and  says, You know what. That’s what I  ran on. I can go home now. I’ve done  my job. I’ve kept my promise.  That’s what CHARLIENORWOODwas  all about. I just want to say, CHARLIE,  you’re home now,  the Augusta,  the  Georgia  that  you  love,  and  our  thoughts and prayers will always be  with you and the great honor that you  have given all of us here to serve with  you in this great body.

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of  House Concurrent Resolution 63, a bipartisan  resolution  supporting  our  troops  in  Iraq, while  opposing  the  President’s troop escalation strategy.  This marks the fourth year of this  war. It  is time to bring our troops  home now. We have not quelled the violence. We have not thwarted al Qaeda.  We have not stabilized the region. We  have not deterred terrorist radicals. In  fact, because of our presence, there are  more jihadists in Iraq than there were  before.  Thus, I find it inconceivable that the  President’s response to this situation, 3  years of military failure in Iraq, is to  suggest that we add more troops, 20,000  additional troops.  Since the start of the war in 2003,  over 3,000 U.S. troops have died, more  than 50 from my State of Maryland  alone. In addition, 23,000 American soldiers have suffered serious injury and  will have post-traumatic consequences.

127,House,110,0.367,76,2007-02-14,Mr. BROWN of South Carolina.,"  I  thank the gentleman from New York  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, as President Bush and  his top military advisers  implement  the new plan for victory in Iraq, we  must be united in a common goal for  victory, and we should never  forget  that our enemy is listening to this debate, just as our troops are listening to  every word of every Member of this  Congress.  As many of my colleagues have done,  I have personally visited Iraq. I have  seen the progress and I have seen the  good  job  that  our  brave men  and  women are doing for us and for the people of Iraq.  We have achieved some major accomplishments  in  Iraq. Women are now  able to vote in real elections for the  first time in their lives. Iraqi citizens  are now able to protest and let their  opinions be heard in public, and Iraq is  a self-governing nation,  free of tyranny.  I was proud to sit down and share a  meal with many soldiers from South  Carolina’s First District. And the question many of our soldiers kept asking  me was, why are none of the good stories making it back to the folks at  home?  Mr. Speaker, I think that many of us  today are trying to share some of the  good stories and recognize some of the  positive things that our brave men and  women in Iraq are doing for us.  South Carolina’s First District has a  high proportion of active and retired  military personnel and are directly impacted by the war in the Middle East.  At the Charleston Air Force Base, the  C–17 aircraft that come and go are a direct link in the supply chain that assist our brave soldiers fighting for us in  Iraq.  At  Force  Protection  in  Ladson,  South Carolina, they continue to build  the Buffalo and the Cougar vehicles  that  save  the  lives of our  soldiers  against  the mines and  IED attacks  every day.  Last year on Memorial Day, in my  capacity as chairman of the Veterans  Affairs Subcommittee on Health, I was  fortunate  enough  to  be  the  guest  speaker at an American cemetery in  Normandy, France, which  overlooks  Omaha Beach.  Our brave soldiers during World War  II were  in France not to  fight the  French, but  to  fight  the occupying  Nazis. Today our soldiers are not in  Iraq and Afghanistan to fight the citizens of those countries, but are there  to fight the insurgents in Iraq and the  Taliban in Afghanistan.  In listening to the debate over the  past few days, it reminded me of my  visit and reading some of the names of  the brave soldiers that fought our Nation’s war during World War II.  Mr. Speaker, there are over 9,300 buried  in Normandy. Those brave souls  fought in a war against the forces of  evil then, just as our soldiers in Iraq  are fighting against the forces of evil  today.  What would have happened if Franklin Delano Roosevelt pulled our troops  out of France after the casualties we  took  storming  the beaches of Normandy? If Franklin Delano Roosevelt  was alive today, what would he think  of this debate which empowers and energizes our enemies and demoralizes  our brave  fighting men and women?  What would America have done if the  Congress enacted a nonbinding resolution to pull our troops out of France  after D–Day? What kind of world would  we be living in today?  Iraq is directly tied to the future security of our Nation, and consequently,  failure in Iraq is not an option.  I do not believe we have already lost  in Iraq, but we will lose if we don’t give  the troops what they need to win. I remain hopeful that the Democrats and  Republicans can unite around a new  policy,  clearly  defining  our  troops’  mission for the sake of our national security.  Mr. Speaker,  I  support President  Bush and his vision for the new strategy for victory in Iraq. I cannot in  good faith support this resolution because it sends our soldiers the message  that the United States Congress believes  that  they  cannot  succeed  in  their mission. It is much easier to complain, while offering no real ideas or alternatives. This resolution is all bark  and no bite.  I will conclude with a quote from a  good friend and someone I am proud to  have  as my  constituent, Medal  of  Honor recipient and retired Major General James Livingston. ‘‘Today we have  a choice of fighting the enemy in Iraq.  If we do not take them on in Iraq, then  we will be forced to fight the enemy  here on our homeland.’’  Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this  resolution.  b2040  ",2007

129,House,110,0.75,90,2007-02-14,Mr. TANCREDO.," Mr. Speaker, the  approaching vote on this resolution has  caused me and I am sure many of my  colleagues to give serious and considerable thought to the most difficult issue  that faces America today.  Like many of my  friends on both  sides of the aisle, and like many Americans I am opposed to increasing our  troop presence in Iraq. I am sure we  have all asked ourselves individually  what we would do if we were in the  oval office at this time.  If I were in the oval office, if I were  Commander in Chief, I would tell the  Iraqis something similar to what Benjamin Franklin  told a woman who  asked him as he came out of the negotiations on the Continental Congress,  Dr. Franklin, what have you given us?  He answered, a Republic  if you can  keep it.  Mr. Speaker, I believe we have with  our blood and treasure already won a  great victory when we deposed a dictator and helped the Iraqis set up a  fledgling democracy. Frankly, I believe  it is up to them to keep it.  Mr. Speaker, the fall of Saddam has  helped create a situation in the Middle  East that we did not anticipate but one  that can be exploited. I believe that the  ethnic and sectarian earthquake inside  and across the broader Middle East is  underway. I believe the fault lines in  this conflict can be seen moving today,  not just in Iraq, but in Lebanon, Iran  and elsewhere.  If  I were Commander  in Chief,  I  would do what I could to exploit the  situation. I believe it can be exploited,  but not if we are acting as a referee in  what has become a civil war. I believe  that prolonging or increasing the U.S.  presence  in Iraq will virtually guarantee this fault line will move in a way  not advantageous to us.  Sure, if I was President, Mr. Speaker,  I can tell you unequivocally I would  not be sending an extra 20,000 soldiers.  But I am not President of the United  States, I am not Commander in Chief,  I am a Member of Congress. And while  I have every right as a Member of Congress to voice my concerns and objections to what I see as  flaws  in the  strategies this President may choose to  employ, neither I nor this Congress has  the right to micromanage a war.  Mr. Speaker, our Constitution vests  sole authority of the U.S. military in  the President of the United States, not  in 435 Congressmen or 100 Senators.  Our Founding Fathers empowered the  President, not the Congress, with the  authority precisely to avoid the kind of  group micromanagement of our military strategy that we are seeing on  this floor today.  I differ with the President on many  things, Mr. Speaker.  Indeed one of  them is the recently announced surge  strategy. But while  I am concerned  about the wisdom of the strategic military decision, Congress does not have  the authority nor the ability to manage this war or any other by committee.  I fear that this resolution is just the  beginning of a long-term attempt by  Congress to become the micromanager  of the conflict in Iraq. As many Members have correctly noted, this resolution is nonbinding, but it has been described by its authors as just the bark  from the Congressional dog. The bite  will come as they say during the appropriations process.  As  I  said  at  the  beginning, Mr.  Speaker,  for a  time  this  resolution  posed a dilemma  for me. But after  hours of listening to the debate, reading the Constitution, it helped me to  decide how to vote, there is no longer a  doubt in my mind. I accept the wisdom  of the Founding Fathers and bend to  the constraints of the document that  we swear to uphold and defend.  I hope that Members of both sides  will think carefully about the precedent that this debate will set for the  future,  for  future Presidents,  future  wars, future soldiers. I would ask them  to  join me  in opposing this  ill-conceived resolution.  ",2007
130,House,110,-0.495,90,2007-02-14,Mr. DELAHUNT.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA).  ",2007
131,House,110,-0.187,90,2007-02-14,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise this  evening to welcome this much needed  debate, on perhaps one of the greatest  challenges facing our generation, our  country, this war in Iraq. I intend to  support this nonbinding resolution not  because I believe it is perfect, rather in  fact I feel it is probably imperfect.  But I am supporting it because I hope  this will be the beginning of a rational,  bipartisan dialogue for a new direction  to  be  employed  together with  the  House  of Representatives, with  the  Congress working together with the  President.  For after all, Mr. Speaker, we are the  people’s House. The choices that we  have before us today are more than  simply cut and run or stay the course.  For after all, we know a long time ago  that was nothing more than a sound  bite, and the American public understood that it was nothing more than a  political sound bite. We are a wonderful country. We have tremendous resources, ingenuity, and we have credibility notwithstanding our difficulties  today throughout the world.  And therefore, as the world’s greatest  super power, we have resources and  means  in which we can offer alternative choices to bring together people,  not only in the Middle East, but allies  throughout the world that supported us  in the past.  Everyone who has talked about this  nonbinding resolution talks about the  cost. We all talk about their support  for our men and women in uniform, our  support to continue to ensure that they  are properly funded and to ensure that  we always, always remember the current costs that have been expended,  over 3,000 lives, over 23,000 that have  been  injured, and a  fiscal accountability  that has gotten  lost  in  the  checks and balances of the Congress, a  war that  initially was advertised to  cost us $60 billion is now in excess of  $379 billion, $8 billion a month, with a  supplemental request for another $235  billion.  Mr. Speaker, we do not need nor  should we micromanage the war. But  we should, as an equal branch of Government, require and demand accountability. That is why I stood up on this  floor 2 weeks ago supporting the Blue  Dog Accountability Act to ensure that  we have an opportunity to review on a  regular basis the conduct of the war,  the  no-bid  contracts,  the  single  sourcing, putting our troops in harm’s  way without adequate armament.  Let us not forget, for almost 4 years  our President and the course that he  conducted and the case he has made  has had a blank check,  literally a  blank check to conduct this effort as  he saw fit.  b2245  And it has only been in the last 6  months when  it became abundantly  clear in the last year that it was determined that a new course or a new direction would be needed. But, unfortunately, so much of this new course that  the President offered  last month  is  more of the same and, unfortunately,  too little too late.  I told the President that I was doubtful on this surge. Why? Because we  have had previous surges, back in August of last year a surge in Baghdad  with six brigades that was promised by  the Iraqi Army. They delivered two.  They weren’t very good. We neutralized  Sadr City. Maliki got political pressure  placed on him. We were asked to leave.  Unless we have a robust political effort  that accompanies  this  surge,  I  fear, unfortunately, more of the same  will occur, which is why I asked the  Secretary of State last week what is  plan B?  We are, whether we like it or not, in  the middle of a sectarian civil war. And  unfortunately, the folks that we are  trying to referee are more concerned  about how power is distributed and how  oil revenues are distributed as opposed  to instituting a democracy in the Middle East. And therefore, we need a new  direction.  Have we not learned the lessons that  many of us remember from the Vietnam War? Secretary Powell knew those  lessons well. Remember what Secretary Powell advised our President?  He says, Iraq, Mr. President, is like a  Pottery Barn. We break it, we own it.  Unfortunately, how true those words  have come.  But Secretary Powell knew from his  experience as a general that the Powell  doctrine invoked four principles, one,  to have overwhelming support of the  Nation; two, in fact, to ensure that we  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:21 Feb 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00090 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K14FE7.177 H14FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007

134,Senate,110,-0.37,125,2007-02-14,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Madam President,  this  joint  funding  resolution  is not  what anyone wanted. We are in this position because the last Congress failed  to do its job. We had no choice. We  were determined to stay within strict  spending limits while trying to address  compelling needs.  I believe we have  done the best we can do. We were able  to take care of the most important priorities facing the nation without going  over our spending limits.  In the Commerce, Justice, Science  chapter of this resolution, we were able  to increase funding for the Department  of Justice by $1.4 billion over last year  to ensure there were no cuts to the FBI  and the war against terror. We provided the FBI with a $333 million increase over the old CR which  fully  funds the FBI, U.S. attorneys and the  Bureau of Prisons. More importantly,  the additional $1.4 billion eliminates  the cuts to State and local law enforcement proposed in the President’s budget. At a time when crime rates are  going back up according to the most  recent FBI crime statistics, we fully  fund the COPS program, as well as programs to fight gangs and sexual predators. Protecting our neighborhoods and  communities remains our No. 1 priority and this extra funding is proof of  our  commitment  to make America  safer.  We were also able to make a down  payment on our innovation and competitiveness agenda. We added $335 million to the National Science Foundation’s research account to increase our  commitment  to basic  research  that  will  lead  to new  breakthroughs  in  science, technology and future innovation to keep America competitive in  the global economy. In addition, we  added $38 million to the National Institute of Standards and Technology to  increase research grants and an additional $12 million to modernize their  laboratory facilities. Finally, we gave  the Patent and Trademark Office the  full $1.7 billion called for in the President’s fiscal year 2007 budget request  and ensured that all patent fees stay  with the Patent Office.  While I would have liked to have increased funding for NASA, there was  simply not enough extra funding available for us to do so. Within the limits  of NASA’s fiscal year 2006 operating  plan, we added an extra $460 million to  exploration while protecting other critical NASA programs in science and aeronautics. With only 7 months left in  this fiscal year, I believe NASA will be  able to manage their programs in exploration with minimal impact to the  overall schedule.  This bill cuts $3.3 billion in Military  Constructions funds required to implement the 2005 Base Realignment and  Closure round. By putting the entire  year’s BRAC Military  Construction  program on hold, the current situation  has caused adverse disruptions to important military planning. In Maryland  alone, the Defense Department is unable to execute over $300 million worth  of projects, preventing the construction of badly needed facilities that directly support our warfighters. This  delay also has a huge impact on the  economy of the State of Maryland, in  the construction  industry and other  key  support  industries. Finally,  the  continuing resolution blocks critical  projects required to implement the 2005  Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC,  recommendations,  jeopardizing  the  ability of our military installations to  required BRAC actions on  complete  time.  I, along with the other members of  the Maryland congressional delegation,  have sent a letter to the Chairmen and  ranking members of  the House and  Senate Appropriations Committee, urging them to fully fund BRAC Military  Construction  in the  fiscal year 2007  emergency supplemental spending bill.  Both the House and Senate majority  leaders have pledged their support for  our effort. I will fight to add this vital  funding  to  the  emergency  supplemental when it comes before the Senate in March.  So while this bill is not what anyone  wanted, it is the best we could do considering what we were left with. I will  support this continuing resolution and  I will fight to do better next year.

135,Senate,110,-0.194,125,2007-02-14,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Madam  President, I rise today to clarify an  issue of concern to communities in my  home state of Florida, particularly to  those who have been affected by natural disasters in recent years.  The continuing resolution, H.J. Res.  20, contains a revision to the formula  for funding the critical section 8 tenant-based  rental  assistance  voucher  program. Inefficiencies in the voucher  funding  formula  in place  since  2004  have resulted in the loss of vouchers  for an estimated 150,000  families nationwide. My understanding is that the  revised formula will provide sufficient  funding for the number of families assisted last year, and provides a $100  million pool to assist agencies who experience unusual circumstances during  the transition.  However, due to the devastating hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, several of our  Florida communities helped unusually  low numbers of families last year. This  is because the hurricanes devastated  their housing stock they simply did  not have the apartments and houses to  rent.  In some areas, the amount of  need did not decline; there was simply  a shortage of affordable housing options.  I rise to confirm my understanding  that the section 8 funds for housing assistance payments already allocated by  the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, HUD, to a local housing  authority will remain accessible.  If my understanding is correct, housing authorities may continue to use  the  funds  in their possession, along  with their  fiscal year 2007  funds, to  lease up to the authorized level of units  under contract. This will ensure that  our hurricane damaged communities  and others who have seen losses in recent  years  due  to  unforeseen  circumstances or  the dislocations  that  have occurred since 2004 will be able to  recover. As our communities rebuild, I  want to make sure that our housing  agencies will continue to have access  to the available resources needed to  serve low-income families.  ",2007

Today, just as almost a century ago,  Americans are drawn to Arizona’s economic opportunity, culture, and natural beauty. At the time of statehood,  Arizona’s population numbered in the  hundreds  of  thousands,  but  it was  growing quickly, from around 200,000 in  1910 to over 330,000 in 1920. Today, it is  the Nation’s  fastest growing State,  with a population of more than 6 million.  Tourists flock to the State for its  cultural heritage and scenic beauty.  Arizona is home to four national parks  and many other national monuments  and historic  sites. Many who visit  these sites are heeding the advice of  Theodore Roosevelt, who said of the  Grand Canyon,  ‘‘You cannot improve  on it. But what you can do is to keep  it  for your children, your children’s  children, and all who come after you,  as the one great sight which every  American should see.’’  From its days as a rough Wild West  territory to the dynamic State it is  today, Arizona’s beauty and culture  has captivated those who have experienced  it.  I wish the State a happy  birthday.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  KANSAS AIR NATIONAL GUARD  ∑",2007
138,Senate,110,-0.351,146,2007-02-14,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased today to join my friend and  colleague,  the  senior Senator  from  Georgia, as a cosponsor of legislation  to provide some needed improvements  to the Food Stamp Program’s eligibility rules.  Senator CHAMBLISS’ legislation, the  Food Stamp Personal Savings and Investment Act of 2007, would exempt retirement accounts and educational savings accounts from the current asset  limits test  in the Food Stamp Program. Additionally,  this  bill would  index the current asset limit to inflation.  For most households,  the  current  asset limit in the Food Stamp Program  is $2000; $3000 for households with an elderly individual or an individual with a  disability. This  limit has not been  raised in over 20 years, making it inconsistent with  the  economic  challenges  faced by  today’s  low-income  working families in America.  In addition, current Food Stamp Program resources rules are inconsistent.  Many types of retirement accounts and  all educational savings accounts are  counted against the asset limit, meaning that a working mother who has recently become unemployed but managed to save $2500 for her daughter’s  college education is actually ineligible  for food stamps. This forces otherwise  eligible households to have to choose  between  liquidating  such  savings,  which in many cases are also subject to  a financial penalty, or going without  needed food assistance.  It is clear that current Food Stamp  Program rules actually discourage people from planning responsibly for their  futures and deny them a helping hand  at a time when they need it most. It  makes no sense for the government to  force  families  that  are  suffering  through periods of unemployment to  spend down  the  savings which  represent their only source of security in  times of hardship. In essence we require people to trade-off their minimal  savings for meager food stamp benefits  that equal an average of one dollar per  meal per person.  If our true goal is to provide low-income families with a hand up—to help  make a better life for themselves and  their  children—then we must  enact  policies that actually encourage them  to build the resources that are necessary to get out of poverty and remove the barriers to saving that exist  in current law. Exempting retirement  and educational savings accounts from  the Food Stamp Program’s asset limits  test will help do that.  Similarly,  adjusting  the  current  asset limit so that it rises with inflation will provide a more reasonable,  less-restrictive threshold that, though  modest, will at least prevent further  erosion in the current asset limits. I’m  hopeful that we can do more than just  indexing the current limit, which is too  restrictive. I hope that we can first increase the asset limits and then index  them annually to inflation. But Senator CHAMBLISS’ bill is a good start,  and I commend him for seeking to address this problem.  Taken together, these are common  sense changes that are needed throughout our federal anti-poverty programs  to allow  low-income Americans who  are currently discouraged from saving  to invest in their futures. The Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and  Forestry obviously has no jurisdiction  over other anti-poverty programs, but  we can start by removing the unrealistic and damaging  limits that currently exist within the Food Stamp  Program.  I should also make clear that this is  not the only change needed to improve  upon the Food Stamp Program. We  clearly must do more to help those who  suffer  from  food  insecurity  in  this  country, and there are a number of  other  improvements  that we  should  make to our  federal  food assistance  programs to help low-income families  put food on their tables.  This legislation is a good start to the  larger  objective  of  simplifying  and  strengthening our food assistance programs to make them more responsive  and relevant to helping meet the needs  of today’s low-income American families. I commend Senator CHAMBLISSfor  introducing this bill, am happy to cosponsor  it and  look  forward to continuing to work with him to promote  economic and food security and stability  for  low-income Americans and  families.  By Ms. COLLINS:  S. 592. A bill to amend the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for a  manufacturer’s  jobs  credit,  and  for  other purposes; to the Committee on  Finance.  ",2007
139,Senate,110,0.109,146,2007-02-14,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  introduce  legislation,  the  ‘‘Growing Our Manufacturing Employment Act, or ‘‘GoME,’’ which is aimed  at  reinvigorating  the manufacturing  sector, boosting the level of domestic  manufacturing, and preventing the further loss of manufacturing jobs.  Few issues are as important to the  American people than the availability  of good  jobs  in  their  communities.  Manufacturing jobs have long provided  quality employment for generations of  Americans. But in recent years, employment in the manufacturing sector  has dropped, and over 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost since the  year 2000.  Few States have been hit harder by  the loss of manufacturing jobs than my  home State of Maine. According to the  National Association of Manufacturers,  Maine has  lost 22,000 manufacturing  jobs—nearly 28 percent of our total—  since  the beginning of  this decade.  These jobs once provided lifelong employment  to Mainers  in  towns  like  Millinocket, Wilton, Waterville, Fort  Kent, Dexter, Westbrook, and Sanford.  Here is but one example of the tragic  results of this ongoing trend, from my  home State of Maine: For 60 years,  Moosehead Manufacturing  produced  furniture of the highest quality—beautiful  designs  and  quality materials  combined with expert craftsmanship.  Last week, Moosehead closed its doors.  More than 120 skilled workers have lost  their jobs. A traditional Maine business, built from the ground up by a  Maine family, is gone.  Why  are American manufacturing  jobs disappearing? Three years ago, the  National Association of Manufacturers  released a study showing that American manufacturers  face  ‘‘structural  costs’’ that makes it 22 percent more  expensive to manufacture goods here  than overseas. Last fall, NAM updated  this study, and found that these costs  are escalating, with American manufacturers now facing a cost differential  31 percent higher than our nine leading  trading partners.  While it would surprise no one that  U.S. manufacturers face a higher cost-  of-doing business than manufacturers  in countries like China and Mexico, it  would be a mistake to assume that  wage  rates  alone  explain  this  difference. They do not. In fact, the productivity  of  American  workers  is  unrivaled, allowing American workers  to receive more value, in wages, for the  goods they produce. As the original  NAM study states, if wages were the  only factor, then ‘‘U.S. manufacturers  would be much more dominant . . . in  the global markets than the current  trade situation suggests.’’  It is other  ‘‘structural costs’’ that  make it more expensive to manufacture goods in the U.S. relative to the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:34 Feb 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G14FE6.043 S14FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 0 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

141,Senate,110,-0.309,15,2007-03-02,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, 46 years  ago, President John F. Kennedy proposed to the Congress one of the most  successful and influential programs in  the history of our Nation. It was on  March 1, 1961, that President Kennedy  asked the Congress to establish the  Peace Corps.  In making that request, President  Kennedy pointed out that the program  would be of great benefit to struggling  nations that were in ‘‘urgent need for  skilled manpower.’’ The program has  helped meet that need as more than  187,000 volunteers have served in the  Peace Corps since its inception, in 139  countries.  President Kennedy  also  explained  that the program would benefit developed nations as well.  ‘‘The future of  freedom around the world,’’ President  Kennedy explained,  ‘‘depend[s],  in a  very real sense, on the ability to build  growing and independent nations where  men can live in dignity, liberated from  the bonds of hunger,  ignorance, and  poverty.’’ In pursuit of the Peace Corps  mission of helping people help themselves  throughout  the world, Peace  Corps volunteers have served as school  teachers, economic development advisers,  agricultural  and  environmental  specialists, and in various capacities as  skilled laborers. These dedicated Americans have helped developing nations  with health and sanitation projects and  have assisted them in increasing their  agricultural  production.  They  have  helped these nations to combat diseases, including malaria and HIV/AIDS,  that have, for too long, plagued underdeveloped nations. Because of the outstanding work of  its volunteers, the  Peace Corps has become an enduring  symbol of the American commitment  to freedom through the encouragement  of the social, as well as the economic  progress of all nations.  And, in proposing the creation of the  Peace Corps, President Kennedy forthrightly acknowledged that American  self-interest was involved in the creation of the program. ‘‘Our own young  men and women,’’ he explained, ‘‘will  be enriched by the [Peace Corps] experience . . . an experience which will aid  them in their future careers.’’ And it  did.

143,House,110,-0.353,11,2007-03-15,Mr. LYNCH.," Madam Chair, I want to,  first of all, thank the gentleman for  yielding.  I rise in strong support of H.R. 1362,  the Accountability in Contracting Act.  This is contract reform legislation that  was reported favorably out of our Oversight Committee by unanimous consent, and I think that speaks to the  merits of this bill. As a result of the  hard work of Chairman WAXMAN and  Ranking Member DAVIS, this is a good  first step in bringing accountability to  contracting practices  in our government.  By minimizing  the use, as others  have said, of the abusive no-bid contract  practice, we will  reintroduce  competition into this contracting protocol used by our government. As well  as limiting the use of cost-plus contracts, we will strengthen the reporting and disclosure  requirements  for  contract  overcharges  and  increase  funding  for  contract  oversight  personnel. H.R. 1362 will address the glaring weaknesses in our Federal procurement system that have caused considerable waste, fraud, and abuse of American taxpayer dollars.  The need  to  reform Federal  contracting law has been with us for some  time and demonstrated, I think, glaringly during our series of contracting  hearings in the House Oversight Committee, as we continue to examine a  variety of misguided and poorly managed, poorly designed, and extremely  costly Federal  contracts  that have  been issued.  In the area of Iraq reconstruction,  where we have spent a lot of time, we  have learned from William Reed, the  Director of the DCAA, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, of more than $10  billion, 10 billion with a ‘‘b,’’ in questioned and unsupported costs related to  our Iraq reconstruction and troop support contracts. In addition, based on  updated data provided  to  the  committee  by  DCAA,  we  know  that  Halliburton’s three massive cost-plus  contracts alone are the source of at  least $2.7 billion in questioned and unsupported billings. And until recently,  unfortunately, we have not had auditors on the ground in Iraq. The DCAA  did not have contractors on the ground  to review these contracts. They were  auditing these contracts from Alexandria, Virginia. We have changed that  process and put people on the ground.  In the area of homeland security, we  recently examined the Department of  Homeland Security’s $24 billion contract to modernize the Coast Guard’s  aging fleet and the $30 billion SBInet  contract to design and  implement a  modernized border security plan. Based  on thousands of pages of documents  provided by DHS to our committee, we  have  learned  that  the Department’s  oversight of these massive contracts is  severely limited by what they call the  ‘‘prime  integrator’’ contracts. These  prime  integrator contracts vest  the  government oversight responsibility in  program design and construction  to  contractors to do this very work. In addition, we came to find out the Department had actually contracted out oversight  functions that  it had retained  under the contract terms.  This is a good first step. And I want  to give great credit to Chairman WAXfor his good work and also Mr.  DAVIS for building compromise in this,  and I think that the American taxpayers will be better served by the result of the work of these two gentlemen.

145,House,110,-0.206,18,2007-03-15,Mr. ARCURI.," Mr. Chairman, it is time to rein  in this administration’s prevalent use of no-bid  contracts.  I urge all my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support this rule and the  Accountability in Contracting Act.  In the last five years, spending on ‘‘no-bid’’  or ‘‘sole-source’’ contracts has more than doubled. The  administration  contends  that  in  every one of these cases there were ‘‘urgent  and compelling needs’’  that  required  these  contracts to be awarded without a competitive  bidding process. In the case of the emergency  response to disasters like hurricanes Katrina  and Rita, I don’t dispute that the need was urgent,  but  for  non-emergency  contracting  needs, we must get our fiscal house in order.  Just as any family has a budget to stick to,  shouldn’t we reach a point after an emergency  when there has been enough time to consider  multiple, competitive bids? A point after which  the  ‘‘compelling needs’’ are a  little  less urgent? By last June—nine months after Hurricane Katrina—$10.6 billion had been awarded  to private contractors for recovery efforts, but  only 30 percent of  that had been awarded  competitively.  I know of no small business in Upstate New  York, who could get by without  reasonably  budgeting for their expenses—even in times of  emergency. Why should  taxpayer dollars be  spent differently?  Oversight of  these contracts has been no  better. Audits have revealed that post-Katrina  contractors have over-billed, double-billed, and  billed for work that was never completed. The  Defense Contractor Audit Agency  found  that  through  fiscal year 2006, over $10 billion  in  contractor charges in Iraq have been identified  as ‘‘questioned’’ or ‘‘unsupported.’’  Under this administration, the use of ‘‘cost  plus’’ contracts has increased more than seventy-five percent. These cost-plus contracts  guarantee a contractor a fixed profit, regardless of how efficiently they spend the government’s money—taxpayers’ money. These contracts provide no  incentive  to  look after  the  bottom line because they guarantee there will  always be money off the top. When indefinite,  no-bid  contracts  contain  ‘‘cost-plus’’  provisions, the opportunity for foul play is only amplified.  The Accountability  in Contracting Act addresses  these concerns. This bill  limits  to  roughly 8 months the time that federal no-bid  contracts can  last.  It  requires each  federal  agency that has awarded at least $1 billion in  the preceding fiscal year to develop and implement a plan to minimize the use of contracts entered  into using no-bid procedures  and cost-reimbursement  type contracts. The  bill also establishes a system to increase competition in contract bidding and requires agencies that enter into a no-bid contract to make  ‘‘justification and approval’’ documents public  within fourteen days after awarding a contract.  Mr. Chairman, we have a responsibility to  the American people  to spend  their hard-  earned  tax dollars  in a  fiscally  responsible  way. And the Accountability in Contracting Act  will help reach  that end by providing much-  needed  transparency  to  the way  the  federal  government awards contracts.  ",2007

155,Senate,110,0.494,95,2007-03-15,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to discuss the importance of the  need to reauthorize the Secure Rural  Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000.  This act expired September 30, 2006,  and now over 700 counties and 4,400  school districts in 39 States are in financial limbo.  In simple terms, this means that 8  million kids in rural America are going  to be impacted by Congress’s inaction.  This is simply unacceptable.  I have been joined by several of my  colleagues in introducing, S. 779, a simple  one  year  reauthorization. This  measure would provide some certainty  to the impacted counties and schools  while Congress works to address the  larger issue of a multiyear reauthorization.  It is clear to me that the safety net  payments need to continue, but in a  manner that encourages and focuses on  building collaboration—one of the cornerstones of this act.  For my colleagues who are unfamiliar with this issue, let me quickly  review how the Congress got to this  point.  In 1992, Congress provided some counties in the Pacific Northwest with a  temporary  financial  ‘‘safety net’’ to  help them transition from the timber  boom years of the 1980s.  The  safety net was  scheduled  to  gradually phase out over a 10-year period, but demands for a more inclusive  program resulted  in  its early termination and the enactment of another  temporary program, the Secure Rural  Schools  and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000.  This act was designed to allow counties an opportunity to transition back  to the traditional revenue sharing programs.  The temporary safety net was originally recommended to Congress by the  National Forest County Schools Coalition.  One  of  the  Coalition’s  principles  States that special payments to States  under this  legislation will provide a  short-term safety net with a specific  termination date.  The county payments program dramatically broadened the geographical  and substantive scope of the original  safety net payment.  The large majority of the funds still  were focused on the Pacific Northwest,  but  the new national program permitted most States and counties across  the country to participate and benefit  from it thus, providing a measure of financial certainty to all counties that  rely on revenues from Federal forest  lands.  The act has been an enormous success, not just achieving but surpassing  the goals of Congress.  This act has restored programs for  students in rural areas and prevented  the  closure  of  numerous  isolated  schools. It has been a primary funding  mechanism to provide rural school students with educational opportunities  comparable to those enjoyed by suburban and urban students.  Next, the act has allowed rural county road districts to address the severe  maintenance backlog. Snow  removal  has been restored for citizens, tourists,  and school buses. Bridges have been upgraded and replaced, and culverts that  are hazardous to fish passage have been  upgraded and replaced.  In addition, over 70 Resource Advisory Committees, or RACs, have been  formed.  Nationally,  these  15-person diverse  RAC  stakeholder  committees  have  studied and approved more than 2,500  projects on Federal forestlands and adjacent public and private lands.  These projects have addressed a wide  variety of  improvements drastically  needed on our public lands. Projects  have included fuels reduction, habitat  improvement, watershed  restoration,  road maintenance and rehabilitation,  reforestation,  campground  and  trail  improvement, and noxious weed eradication.  RACs are a new and powerful partnership between county governments  and the land management agencies.  They are rapidly building the capacity for collaborative public land management decision making in over 150 of  our largest forest counties in America  and are reducing the gridlock over public land management, community by  community.  In the future, I feel the RACs will be  providing the leadership to build consensus for projects that will keep our  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:35 Mar 16, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A15MR6.028 S15MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 0 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007
156,Senate,110,0.782,102,2007-03-15,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I rise  today as the lead Republican sponsor of  the Genocide Accountability Act of  2007. I thank my colleague, Senator  DURBIN, for introducing this important  piece of legislation.  Senator DURBIN serves as the chairman and I serve as the ranking member  of the new Subcommittee on Human  Rights and the Law in the Senate Judiciary Committee. We held our  first  hearing, entitled  ‘‘Genocide and  the  Rule of Law,’’ on February 5, 2007.  There could not be a more appropriate  way to begin examining the law as it  relates to human rights than to determine what we can and must do to prevent and stop genocide. The United  States is a signatory of the Convention  on the Prevention and Punishment of  the Crime of Genocide. This convention  provides that the contracting parties  must  ‘‘undertake to prevent and to  punish’’ the crime of genocide. We have  also passed a  law  implementing the  Genocide Convention.  However, our hearing demonstrated  that there are changes that need to be  made in law and foreign policy to respond to the ongoing genocide in Sudan  and to any genocide that may occur  elsewhere in the future. Fortunately,  two of these changes can be accomplished right now.  The first change can be accomplished  through a bill Senators DURBIN and  CORNYN introduced last week, of which  I am a cosponsor. That bill, the Sudan  Divestment Authorization Act of 2007,  will allow State and local governments  to prohibit the investment of State assets in the Government of Sudan or  companies with certain business relationships with Sudan, while the Government of Sudan is subject to sanctions  under U.S.  law. The  second  change can be accomplished through  the bill we are introducing today, the  Genocide Accountability Act of 2007.  This act will ensure that our justice  system has the authority to prosecute  someone who has committed genocide  if that person is found or brought into  the United States.  Under current law, the United States  can deny admission  to and exclude  aliens  from  the United  States  on  human rights grounds. The Attorney  General can also consider avenues for  the prosecution of aliens who have  committed certain crimes,  including  genocide. However, the Attorney General can only prosecute a perpetrator  of genocide if he committed his crimes  within the United States or is a U.S.  national.

157,Senate,110,-0.367,116,2007-03-15,Mrs. CLINTON.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to  introduce the Gestational  Diabetes Act of 2007 with my colleague  Senator COLLINS, to bring attention to  an  important  health  issue  facing  women and children.  I don’t need to tell anyone that we  have an obesity epidemic in the United  States. Many of us realize that as parents, it is our responsibility to pass on  good nutritional habits to our children.  But many women may not realize that  watching what you eat, exercising regularly, and having  control of your  blood sugar levels are serious health  considerations  during  pregnancy.  In  fact, these factors are serious enough  that they can affect both the health of  the mother and the life of the child  into adulthood.  More women than ever are entering  their pregnancies overweight but without an understanding of how their own  weight and nutritional habits can trigger gestational diabetes—a type of diabetes that only occurs during pregnancy. Women who are overweight before pregnancy are not only at greater  risk of having gestational diabetes but  are also more likely to have a c-section  and are at an increased risk for other  serious pregnancy complications.  In New York, gestational diabetes is  on the rise. In New York City alone,  gestational diabetes has risen by nearly 50 percent in about 10 years. This  means that gestational diabetes affects  1 in 25 women, about 400 women per  month. But across the Nation, between  4 and 8 percent of pregnant women in  the United States are affected by gestational diabetes.  Infants of women  who have gestational diabetes are at  increased risk for obesity and developing type 2 diabetes as adolescents or  adults.  As women, we need to pay attention  to our health. We are always worrying  about the health of our children, our  husbands, and our parents, but we  often forget to take care of ourselves.  Today, I am introducing the Gestational Diabetes Act, also known as the  GEDI Act. This  legislation will  increase our understanding of gestational  diabetes by determining  the  factors  that contribute to this condition and  help mothers who had gestational diabetes reduce their risk of developing  type 2 diabetes post-pregnancy.  The GEDI Act will provide funding  for projects to assist health care providers, as well as for communities to  find ways to reach out to women so  that they understand how their own  good health during pregnancy can decrease serious health risks  for their  children.  The GEDI Act would expand research  to determine and develop interventions  to lower the incidence of gestational  diabetes. We need to alert women to  the risk before this condition becomes  an epidemic and, as we have seen so  many times before, education is critical.  We should be doing everything we  can to address the impact of obesity  during pregnancy and to reduce the  prevalence of gestational diabetes  in  pregnant women. The GEDI Act is an  important step in assuring that women  understand this critical issue and that  we fully understand how to equip pregnant women to make the best choices  for their health.  The GEDI Act is supported by the  American Diabetes Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, National Research Center for  Women & Families, International Community Health Services, American Association of Diabetes Educators, and  the American Association of Colleges  of Pharmacy.

With a total score of 4,662 points for  their performance in the smallbore and  air rifle competitions, the undefeated  and defending champion University of  Alaska Fairbanks  ‘‘Nanooks’’ posted  an 18-point win over the U.S. Military  Academy and a 23-point win over Jacksonville State University  to  claim  their  ninth  national  championship  title.  This was the first time the Nanooks  have hosted an NCAA Championship.  More  than  900  spectators, a  record  crowd for an NCAA Rifle Championship, were present to help support the  local team.  Nanooks head  coach Dan Jordan,  along with each member of the 2007  University of Alaska Fairbanks rifle  team, which includes six National Rifle  Association All-Americans, should be  recognized for their achievements during this past season. I congratulate the  team and wish them continued success  in future years.  ",2007

160,,110,0.585,144,2007-03-15,Mr. BURTON.,"  During consideration of  the bill before us,  the Committee approved my amendment  to  close a loophole in the Presidential Records  Act. Current law allows those individuals previously convicted of a crime relating to mishandling Archives records to continue to have  special access  to Presidential  records. My  amendment states that the Archivist shall not  make  available  any  original  Presidential  records to any individual claiming access as a  designated representative under statute, if that  individual has been convicted of a crime relating  to  the review, retention, removal, or destruction of Archives records.  As I noted in Committee, we should take the  simple step of blocking access  to original  Presidential records if you’ve been convicted  of crime related to Archives records.  f  RECOGNIZING  THE  LIFE  AND  WORK OF GENERAL CASIMIR PULASKI,  THE  POLISH HERO  OF  THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR  HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 15, 2007  ",2007
161,,110,-0.514,144,2007-03-15,Mr. RANGEL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to recognize the birth anniversary of General  Casimir Pulaski, the Polish Hero of the Revolutionary War.  Often referred to as the father of American  cavalry, Kazimierz Michal Waclaw Wiktor Pulaski herbu Slepowron, more commonly  referred  to as General Casimir Pulaski, was  born in 1746 in Winiary. Born into one of the  most notable  families  in  the region, he was  sent away at a young age to be educated.  Working alongside his father Jozef in 1768,  Pulaski co-founded the Bar Confederation, an  insurrectionists group  that aimed  to  limit  the  spread of Russian hegemony, a threat to Policy  liberty and Catholicism,  throughout  the  commonwealth. With the motto of ‘‘For Faith  and Freedom,’’ Pulaski participated in leading  a confederation which fought for these goals.  Pulaski gained  renown during  the battle of  1771 and went on  to assert his  leadership  skills, military adroitness and valor in several  battles before being exiled for a failed attempt  to abduct the king. Although his efforts failed,  Pulaski’s  leadership  and  courage  inspired  many.  In  1777 Pulaski  traveled  to  the United  States and met with General George Washington. Pulaski transformed soldiers into highly  mobile forces, instituting the idea of a cavalry;  soldiers who  fought mounted on horseback.  He would go on  to  lead several successful  battles  before  sustaining  a  fatal  gunshot  wound in 1779.  Americans and Polish citizens alike have  recognized Pulaski’s heroism and commitment  to  freedom  for centuries. He  is honored,  in  both countries, in statue and in ceremony. In  death, as in life, he remains a symbol of courage, commitment and friendship between Poland and the United States.  f  TRIBUTE TO JOHN GAINES  HON.

162,,110,-0.345,151,2007-03-15,Mr. HIGGINS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  to  commend Father Robert Anthony Mack for his  50 years of service as an ordained priest, and  his  significant  contributions  to  the western  New York community and Catholic Church.  Father Mack will be honored  in a special  Mass at Saint Louis Parish on Sunday March,  25, and  today  I honor his accomplishments  and devoted service to his parish and community.  A passionate and dedicated man, his contributions to Buffalo include service as chaplain of Nardin Academy, Catholic chaplain of  the Buffalo Fire Department, chaplain at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium and War Memorial  Stadium, and division chairman of the Public  and Service Division of the Erie County United  Way.  A native of Riverside, Father Mack’s  first  pastorate began  in 1973 at Saint Matthew’s  Parish in Buffalo where he served until 1978.  Father Mack also served as pastor of St.  Bridget’s in Newfane, NY, as well as at Saint  Francis Xavier Parish of Buffalo. During his  time at Saint Francis Xavier, Father Mack  served as regional coordinator  for Region 1  parishes and was a member and secretary of  the Black Rock Riverside Clergy Association.  In August 1989, Father Mack was honored in  front of 25,000 people as Irishman of the Year  at a home game of the Buffalo Bisons by the  United Irish American Society of Erie County.  Father Mack also served as the pastor of All  Saints and served as an administrator of the  Rosary Parish in Niagara Falls before being  appointed pastor of St. Louis Parish where he  retired from in 2002. Father Mack also chaired  the Peace and  Justice Committee of  the  Priests’ Senate and was appointed to the Arbitration Section of the Diocesan Due Process  Committee.  Madam Speaker, Father Mack’s experience  during his 50 years as an ordained priest is  unrivaled  in our community. He has been a  leader and an inspiration to countless parishioners and to the community at large. Father  Mack is one of Buffalo’s most prolific men of  faith and on this special occasion, I recognize  his vast accomplishments and dedication  to  our community.  f  RECOGNIZING  RETIRING  SUISUN  CITY POLICE CHIEF RON FORSYTHE  HON.

163,,110,-0.308,151,2007-03-15,Mrs. TAUSCHER.," Madam Speaker, I rise to  recognize Suisun City Police Chief Ron Forsythe, who after nearly 30 years of service to  the community of Suisun City has retired from  the Suisun City Police Department.  Chief Ron Forsythe has unselfishly served  his community with great dedication and pride,  and will leave the department with special recognition and with the highest commendation.  Chief Forsythe began his professional career in 1973, as a student aide in the Daily  Republic  newsroom,  eventually  being  promoted to reporter and photographer.  His time spent in the newsroom piqued his  interest in law enforcement. In 1977, he became a dispatcher and reserve police officer  for the Suisun City Police Department. Working his way up the ranks, Chief Forsythe was  promoted to chief of police in 1993.  During his career in Suisun City, Chief Forsythe was known for his innovative and forward  thinking policies. He  took  leadership  roles in introducing technology, such as automation and car-mounted computers to the department.  Chief Forsythe also instituted the first ‘‘citizen police academy’’ in the county and later  introduced  the  first  ‘‘teen academy’’  in  the  country. Moreover, Chief Forsythe’s role in implementing community policing in Suisun City  played a key role in turning around a city that  was once considered the worst city in the bay  area to live in.  Police Chief Ron Forsythe has served the  citizens of Suisun City with great distinction,  evidenced  by  policing  policies  that  have  served as nationwide models and the numerous State and national awards the department  received.  As Chief Ron Forsythe  retires  from  the  Suisun City Police Department, I would like to  thank him, and his partner, Matthew Forsythe,  for his record of service and concern for the  protection of life and property in the local community, and extend to him sincere best wishes  for continued success in his future endeavors.  f  JUDGE ELISEO B.

Vega. Known affectionately as  ‘‘Cheo,’’  Judge Vega died following a lengthy illness.  Judge Vega was an extraordinary caring  and hardworking man. He was a familiar face  in  the Port  Isabel area and was a political  powerhouse. Despite his several setbacks due  to  illness, when most would  think  that he  couldn’t pull through, the man just kept going  and wouldn’t miss working. He was a man of  great faith and loved life fully. He loved life so  much he didn’t want a sad funeral, so we will  celebrate his life this week.  His  life  touched so many people. Judge  Vega was best known for his role as judge in  the municipal court system. His lengthy judicial  career, beginning  in 1971, spanned generations. He was what you wanted a judge to be:  fair and even-handed. He understood people,  he understood  justice, and he stood at  the  intersection of both.

166,,110,-0.582,1,2007-03-23,Mr. KUCINICH.," Four years ago, Congress was told we had no alternative  but to go to war; that was wrong. Now  Congress is telling the American people we have no alternative but to continue the war, and that by continuing  the war for just another year or two we  will then be able to end the war. War  equals peace. I don’t think so.  This war has achieved a momentum  that has swept up into its tragic hold  people  of  otherwise  good will who  would vote to continue a war when  they really want peace and when the  American people want peace.  I believe you cannot say you are for  peace and vote to keep this war going.  You cannot say you are for peace and  facilitate the theft of Iraqi oil. You  cannot say you are for peace and give  the President enough money not just  to keep this war going, but to attack  Iran  if he  so chooses.  If you want  peace, vote for peace now. If you want  peace, stop funding this war. If you  want peace, stand for the truth.  What America must do and what  Congress has the power to do is to stop  the war now, use the money in the  pipeline to bring the troops home, set  in motion a diplomatic process that  would involve the world community in  moving into Iraq as our troops move  out.

But there is another aspect to this  bill. There are literally 2 million children who are without health care. I  want to at this point recognize and  give due thanks and appreciation to  Congressman JOHNMURTHA. No State  has suffered because of the CHIP program  as  the  children  of Georgia’s  273,000 children who would be without  their health insurance if it were not for  this war supplemental.  When the  issue was taken to the  White House, he said no. All hope was  gone. I went to JOHNMURTHA, and JOHN  MURTHAsaid, we will help you, and we  will attach it to the Iraqi war supplemental. And he took it to Mr. OBEYand  to the Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, I make this  plea  to you, as  the Scripture  says  clearly, suffer not the little children.  This is the only hope for getting our  insurance  for  our  children  in  the  SCHIP program. I urge you to not let  the children of the United States of  America go down the drain.

172,House,110,0.749,15,2007-03-23,Mr. FRANKS of Arizona.," Mr. Speaker, before we vote on this bill, we need  to remind ourselves one more time, the  jihadist terrorism is what this debate  is all about.  Brink Lindsey put it in such succinct  terms when he said, ‘‘Here is the grim  truth: We are only one act of madness  away from a social cataclysm unlike  anything our country has ever known.  After a handful of  such acts, who  knows what kind of civilization breakdown might be in store?’’  Mr. Speaker, as we anticipate future  actions of jihadists and our place in  Iraq, we would do well to consider their  words very carefully. Al Qaeda’s al-  Zawahiri said this: ‘‘The jihad movement is growing and rising. It reached  its peak with the two blessed raids on  New York and Washington. And now it  is waging a great heroic battle in Iraq,  Afghanistan, Palestine, and even within the crusaders’ own homes.’’  Osama bin Laden himself said: ‘‘The  most important and serious issue today  for the whole world is this third world  war. It is raging in the land of the two  rivers,’’ Iraq.  ‘‘The world’s millstone  and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of  the caliphate.’’  Mr. Speaker, if Democrats are correct that the struggle in Iraq is not  crucial  to winning  the war against  jihadism, then for God’s sake, I wish  they would explain that to the terrorists. Instead, we hear the most senior  Democrat in this House quoted as saying, ‘‘I don’t take sides for or against  Hezbollah, or for or against Israel.’’  Mr. Speaker, a blind relativism that  deliberatively  ignores all  truth and  equates merciless terrorism with free  nations defending themselves and their  innocent citizens is more dangerous to  humanity than terrorism itself, and it  is proof that liberals completely misunderstand the enemy that we face.  Because of this kind of relativist neutrality, jihadists now believe they have  a crucial advantage over the free world  and its people. They believe their will  is far stronger than ours, and that they  need only to persevere to prevail.  Mr. Speaker, the passage of this bill  will only encourage them in that belief. And if liberals in this body are  willing to see freedom defeated in Iraq,  they must also be willing to take responsibility for almost certainly what  will follow.  Mr. Speaker,  finally, we can have  peace with jihadists tomorrow if we are  willing to surrender today. And that  kind of  surrender will be on  their  terms, and it will ultimately bring a  nuclear jihad to our children. Future  American generations will despise this  one.  Mr. Speaker, there is still time to defeat this bill. Let us not take this ominous step in this direction.  ",2007
173,House,110,-0.491,22,2007-03-23,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  acknowledge the extraordinary leadership of Mr. DAVIDOBEY, who understands that the strength of our country  is  indeed measured  in our military  might but also in the health and well-  being of the American people.  Thank you for bringing this important legislation to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, today is indeed an historic day. Today, this new Congress  will take the first step: it will vote to  end the war in Iraq.  Any statement on the war in Iraq  must  begin with  a  tribute  to  our  troops. Today and every day we thank  our troops for their courage, for their  patriotism, for the sacrifice that they  and their families are willing to make.  For 4 years and under the most demanding  and  dangerous  conditions  imaginable, they have worked together  to do everything that was asked of  them. As Members of Congress, our  first responsibility under the Constitution, the preamble to the Constitution  to which we take an oath of office, is to  provide for the common defense. We  here in this body have an obligation to  work together to do that for the American people.  Mr. JOHNSON,  our  colleague, you,  PATRICKMURPHY, and everyone in between who has served our country have  helped make it the home of the brave  and the land of the free. I salute you  both.  I would like to also acknowledge two  people who have been the champions of  our troops and experts on our national  security in this body. The two of them  are the leading proponents on the legislation that is on the floor today: the  Chair of  the Armed Services Committee, IKESKELTON; and the Chair of  the  Defense  Appropriations  Committee, JACKMURTHA. The two of them  care deeply about the well-being of our  troops, the readiness of our troops and  its importance to our national security, and they are proposing that we  pass this legislation today.  I have said from the beginning of this  war, this war is a grotesque mistake.

174,House,110,0.426,29,2007-03-23,Mr. TERRY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  opposition to H.R. 1591, a pork-laden $124.3  billion war supplemental that would force U.S.  troops to withdraw from Iraq.  I strongly support benchmarks and high accountability for military and political progress in  Iraq, but not  in a manner  that hurts our  chances of accomplishing those goals. Under  this  legislation, U.S.  troops would be withdrawn from Iraq unless the President’s benchmarks for progress are met by July. This unreasonable requirement would not give General Petraeus enough time to show if the new  ‘‘troop surge’’ is effective.  In addition, this bill would force U.S. troops  to withdraw by August 2008  regardless of  whether the benchmarks are met. Members of  Congress should not be dictating strategy to  our generals in the field.  The authors of  this bill are  talking out of  both sides of  their mouths.  In attempting  to  reach a compromise,  they would  fund  the  troop surge while dooming it to failure by not  allowing enough time to see if it works. It is  clear that a forthright and honest vote on withdrawing U.S.  troops would  fail. The Majority  Party’s Leadership has instead chosen to entice Members of Congress with pork-barrel  spending in exchange for their vote on this bill.  The Washington Post  reported:  ‘‘House  Democratic leaders are offering billions in federal  funds  for  lawmakers’’ pet projects  large  and small to secure enough votes this week to  pass an Iraq funding bill that would end the  war next year.’’  This  so-called  ‘‘emergency’’ war  supplemental  includes non-defense spending such  as $283 million in milk subsidies, $474 million  in peanut subsidies, and $25 million in spinach  subsidies.  This legislation abandons the Majority Party’s supposed leadership on fiscal discipline. It  is a hypocritical and blatant attempt  to gain  votes from Members of Congress through special interest spending. The bill includes non-  military items such as an increase in the minimum wage,  tax relief  for small businesses,  drought aid, hurricane relief, agricultural subsidies and  funds  for child health  insurance.  Each of these items should be debated under  regular order in the House.  I  strongly  support  the  defense-related  spending  items  in  this  legislation,  including  critical equipment  for our  troops and health  care improvements for our veterans such as  funding for Walter Reed Army Medical Center.  I was also proud to sign the discharge petition  to vote on Congressman SAMJOHNSON’s legislation to ensure full funding of our troops.  We must demand meaningful progress  in  Iraq to curb sectarian violence, disarm militias,  train security forces and strengthen the arm of  the new Iraqi government until Iraq can govern  itself. However, H.R. 1591 is clearly not the  answer. Immediately withdrawing U.S. troops  would be an  irresponsible display of politics  that would endanger  future generations of  Americans.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting against this legislation, and to demand a  ‘‘clean’’ war  supplemental  that meets  the  needs of our troops without pork-barrel politics.  ",2007
175,House,110,-0.288,29,2007-03-23,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important legislation.  This supplemental appropriations bill contains vitally important funding for critical priorities and unmet needs. For example, this bill  includes $1.7 billion more than the President  requested  for military health care,  including  funds to correct the scandalous conditions at  Walter Reed and other military hospitals. It includes another $1.7 billion for veterans’ health  care, $2.5 billion for improving the readiness  of our stateside troops and $1.4 billion for military housing allowances. A nation at war simply must provide necessary funds to support  our troops.  In addition, this legislation includes $3.1 billion for military construction to implement the  BRAC mandates that impact Fort Bragg in my  Congressional District and military  communities all across the country. It is important to  note that the former Republican Congressional  Majority failed to pass the military construction  appropriations  and  imperiled  these  priority  projects. This legislation corrects that failure.  Mr. Speaker, the standards and benchmarks  in this legislation will assert some measure of  oversight and accountability  to a war policy  that has been tragically mismanaged by this  administration  for  too  long.  I have  resisted  supporting date certain language for troop redeployment because it is preferable that the  executive branch have the lead in foreign policy in partnership with the legislature. Unfortunately, this Administration has mistakenly interpreted that deference as a blank check for  its go-it-alone approach. No more.  The President’s speech this week calling for  ‘‘courage and resolve’’ demonstrated a continued state of denial. The American people do  not need more  lectures  from  this President  about resolve. Our troops do not need more  lectures about courage. What we need  is a  new  direction  to  rebuild  our military  and  refocus on the true threat to America from al  Qaeda and the Islamic jihadists who attacked  us on 9/11. We must deploy our military might  to Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere  to  eliminate Osama bin Laden and  the  true  ‘‘grave and gathering threat’’ to America.  We must pass  this  legislation  to send a  wake-up call to the President that ‘‘Stay The  Course’’ is no longer an option. Denial is no  longer an acceptable policy.  I urge my colleagues to support a new direction and vote  for this bill.  ",2007
176,House,110,-0.353,29,2007-03-23,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, I will  vote for this Defense Supplemental appropriations bill.  Whatever some may say, I think it would be  grossly  irresponsible  to vote against  it. That  would be to vote against providing America’s  men and women  in uniform with  the equipment and  resources  they need and against  providing them the best health care they may  require when they come home.  I understand why some are urging a vote  against the bill. Many Americans are frustrated  and angry because we are four years into a  war the Bush Administration assured us would  be short and decisive. The Administration’s  misjudgments, lack of planning and poor leadership have made a bad situation worse. So  there are many who do not trust the Bush Administration to find a way to end this war, and  who believe Congress should simply act to cut  off additional funds.  But whatever may be said about the wisdom  of invading Iraq four years ago—and I am one  who believed it was a mistake to do so—the  fact is that we are still deeply engaged in Iraq.  We also must  finish  the  job of securing Afghanistan and defeating  the Taliban and al-  Qaeda. So long as our troops are in the field,  we must provide them what they need even  as we move to change the mistaken policies  of the Administration in Iraq.  This bill begins that change. It includes important  language  to hold  the president accountable to the benchmarks set by his own  administration and the Iraqi government.  Those benchmarks were outlined  in January, when President Bush announced that the  Iraqi government had agreed to pursue all extremists, Shiite and Sunni alike; to deliver Iraqi  Security Forces  to Baghdad  to  join  in  the  ‘‘surge’’; and to establish a strong militia disarmament program. President Bush also announced  that Prime Minister Maliki and his  government agreed  to pursue  reconciliation  initiatives, including enactment of a hydro-carbon  law; conducting of provincial and  local  elections; reform of current laws governing the  de-Baathification process; amendment of  the  Constitution of Iraq; and allocation of Iraqi revenues for reconstruction projects.  By holding the president and the Iraqi government  accountable  for  achieving  these  benchmarks,  this  bill will  provide General  Petraeus and the Administration with the leverage necessary to help the Iraqi government  forge a political solution. And we all know that  it will take a political solution—not a military  one—to end this war.  The bill is an important step toward what I  think must be our goal—a responsible end to  the war in Iraq, based on a strategy of phased  withdrawal of  troops, accelerated diplomacy  and redeployment that is based on Iraqi stability and not arbitrary deadlines.  It is true that this legislation includes a date  certain  for withdrawing U.S. combat  troops  from  Iraq.  I do not believe  this  language  is  wise and were  it up  to me,  this provision  would not be included in the bill. As a matter  of national security policy, we should steer  clear of arbitrary public deadlines and  focus  instead on realistic goals. Our military needs  flexibility to be able to link movements of U.S.  troops to the realities of the situation on the  ground.  The deadline established in this bill—August  of 2008—is far enough away that I believe we  may be able to revisit it if need be, and while  I find its inclusion troubling, I do not believe in  letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.  And the bill’s language does give the president flexibility to protect U.S. interests, since it  allows sufficient  troops  to  remain  to protect  U.S. military and civilians  in  Iraq, conduct  counterterrorism operations, and train Iraqi Security Forces.  The bill also protects our troops by limiting  deployment schedules and setting minimum  readiness standards—based on current Defense Department standards—for U.S. troops  deploying to the region.

177,House,110,-0.379,36,2007-03-23,Mr. YARMUTH.," Mr. Speaker, we began this  week by solemnly marking the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq, the more than 3,200  brave soldiers who have been killed there, and  the 378 billion dollars that have been appropriated thus far. But we end the week with the  historic opportunity to bring about an end to  this catastrophe.  Over the last 4 years, the President not only  failed to provide a plan to win in Iraq, he failed  to offer our troops concrete and attainable objectives. Where he has  let down our  forces  and  the American people, Congress has a  Constitutional obligation  to step  in, and  this,  ‘‘The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans’ Health,  and Iraq Accountability Act,’’ is our chance. It  is our only real chance, to see this war end,  to comply with the stated will of the American  people, and to bring our troops home.  It  is  important  to  remember  that  this bill  does more  than  set  benchmarks  and  a  timeline; it also provides much needed funding  to protect our troops abroad and care for our  veterans at home. A vote against this bill is a  vote for the President but against our soldiers;  it supports the war but abandons our young  men and women in uniform.  That being said, whether we authorize it or  not, the President will find the funding to prolong this war, even if it is at the expense of  our soldiers, our veterans, and other crucial  programs. This country cannot afford another  Walter Reed, nor can  it afford  to send  the  to  indefinitely  President another blank check  extend this occupation.  The President has asked for a bill without  strings attached. He doesn’t deserve a bill  without strings.  In 4 years of acting without  strings,  this war has never had an end  in  sight. We have before us  today  the opportunity to bring finality into view, and I urge my  colleagues, members  of  the Senate,  and  President Bush not  to squander  this opportunity. I ask that we unite in support of Iraqi  independence, U.S. troops, and H.R. 1591.  ",2007
178,House,110,-0.317,36,2007-03-23,Mr. COSTELLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 1591, but with some reservations. While I appreciate the care with which  Speaker PELOSI, Chairman OBEY and  the  Democratic  leadership have approached  this  supplemental appropriations bill, we are  left,  as we often are, with a flawed product. But I  do believe, in regard to Iraq, that it is the best  we are able to do right now.  The legislation for the first time establishes  performance benchmarks for the Iraqi military  and government, and  firmly states  that  it  is  time to bring the troops home sooner rather  than later. I did not vote to authorize the Iraq  war, and  I do not support President Bush’s  troop surge, but if this bill does not pass we  will be forced to pass a funding bill that does  not have these benchmarks, and that would  be nothing more than the status quo, which is  a blank check for President Bush. I say again,  I do not support everything in this legislation,  but it is the best alternative available to us at  the present time.  I am particularly troubled by the non-military  and non-veteran spending in this bill.

179,House,110,0.471,43,2007-03-23,Mr. PEARCE.," Mr. Speaker, ever since  9/11,  law enforcement agencies have  been telling the American people they  should immediately report suspicious  activities. This important step is one  of the best ways we have to stop terrorism. Sadly,  last week, Americans  who were  simply  trying  to protect  themselves in their country have now  found themselves subject to a lawsuit  for reporting suspicious activity.  In a  lawsuit  filed against US Airways, 60 moms removed from planes in  Minneapolis have named ‘‘John Does’’  as defendants. These are simply people  who were watching suspicious activities and called to report those suspicious activities, and now they are  going to be terrorized in our court system in this country.  Mr. Speaker, I think that that is unconscionable, and so I am presenting  the Protecting Americans Fighting  Terrorism Act to keep people safe who  report suspicious activity in this country to law enforcement officials to protect the American people.  I urge my colleagues to support this  important measure to help us be able  to police ourselves and  report  suspicious activity.  f  SUPPLEMENTAL BILL PASSED  FOR PEANUTS  (Mr. KIRK asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

180,House,110,0.274,43,2007-03-23,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Speaker, today the  House passed a bill claiming to be the  U.S. Troop Readiness Act that included  billions in pork barrel spending unrelated to the needs of our troops. The  funding restrictions included in the bill  were so unpopular that the congressional leadership loaded a $25 million  bailout for spinach farmers, a $74 million payment for peanut storage, and a  $283 million subsidy for milk producers,  all to attract votes for the unpopular  bill.  As USA Today stated: ‘‘Votes were  won for peanuts, or to be more accurate,  for peanut subsidies.’’ The bill  also declares all of this spending, for  spinach, for milk and peanut subsidies,  as emergency wartime  supplemental  appropriations.

181,House,110,0.509,50,2007-03-23,Mr. SMITH of Nebraska.," I thank the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING). I appreciate the fact that you speak to the  future. As we look at so many of the  aspects of agriculture, I think sometimes we forget about the future and  how far we have come.  We have water  challenges  in Nebraska. And it is interesting, in the  middle of about a 7-year drought, I  don’t think enough credit is given to  the better practices that have been engaged in Nebraska relating to irrigation,  that  we  are  seeing  record  amounts of yields, record yields amidst  about 50 percent reduction in irrigation.  Now, there are also those critics out  there, they tend to be critical of the  fact that there aren’t return flows from  the former flowing of irrigation perhaps that many would consider waste.  But it is interesting that as farmers become more and more efficient, they are  also criticized along the way, and I  think that that is unfortunate. When  you talk about energy, it is absolutely  vital that we realize that, even amidst  corn prices that are strong, we have  unprecedented  costs of  inputs  especially related to energy, whether it is  the fertilizer or whether it is the diesel  for the tractor.  And that is what makes me nervous  about these urges to regulate industry  even more, that it will drive up the  cost. And not only electricity for the  consumer in their residence, but it will  drive up the cost of energy, as we see it  on farms and ranches. And that will  drive up the cost of food, plain and simple. And as I stated earlier, we have  come a long way in terms of producing  food in an affordable format.  I was reading through, and I noticed  part of the essay contest winner from  the Ag Council of America, and this is  the 2007 winner, LaTasha Cote, a 12th  grader  from Myrtle, Missouri Couch  High School. And students from 7th to  12th grade submitted original essays of  450 words about the importance of agriculture in the United States. Under the  theme,  ‘‘American  Agriculture  in  2025,’’  students were  encouraged  to  focus  their essays on  the potential  landscape of American agriculture in  2025 based on where we are today and  the opportunities that lie ahead. And  Ms. Cote read her essay to industry  representatives, Members of Congress,  Federal agency representatives, media  and others  in a celebration of agriculture; and let me share with you just  an excerpt:  ‘‘The alarm sounds off at about 8:00  a.m. A young man reaches over to turn  it off, gets up, jumps in the shower,  eats his breakfast, and then heads out  the door toward the milk barn. There  is no rush to get to the cows because  they have already been milked.  ‘‘He begins to check the computer  system to see the amount of milk produced from the third milking of the  day. Immediately, a very precise chart  pops up and gives the percentage of  milk given per second, the amount of  butter  fat, and accurately  tells  the  farmer the exact weight of the milk.  ‘‘Wait, where is the reality check?  Well, there isn’t one. This is only one  example of how far the industry in all  farms has come since the year of 2007.’’  And I haven’t had a chance to read  the entire piece, but I wanted to take  this opportunity to congratulate Ms.  Cote and every student who submitted  an essay in the contest. I think that it  may be even sooner than 2025 when we  see these things come about, but it is  great to see young people looking to  the future.  As we look at the big picture of agriculture, certainly globally we always  think of trade, and I think the unfortunate situation with the closure of our  beef, the rejection of our beef in many  cases to Asia, but it does I think send  a message to the larger issue of where  we are at with livestock in America. It  is interesting that we do find ourselves  with a bit of a shortage of grain to feed  our livestock.  b1415  And as we try to address this shortage, certainly, I think it can be best if  the government stays out of the way.  But when I hear concerns of this and  the  livestock  industry, perhaps, getting a little worried, it worries me, too,  because  the  livestock  industry  has  been absolutely crucial to economies of  rural America. And the fact that these  economies are not, I think, appreciated  like they should be, it is interesting to  note how further regulations of the recent past have led to many livestock  operations having  to become much,  much larger. And as they become much  larger, certainly, others become concerned about the livestock waste.  And it was encouraging to me last  year to finally see some understanding  that we don’t want policies that force  the producer to get larger. We want  them to have the options of getting  larger should they pursue that. Should  they feel comfortable with their current status, that is fine, too.  It is interesting, though, as we see  large operators, small operators, middle-size, medium-size  operators, we  have to realize that I believe our fundamental responsibility is to create opportunities. Government can create opportunities, not through a check necessarily, but we can create policy opportunities so that the little guy has  the option of getting larger and can  prosper  and  pursue  the  economic  dreams that they wish to.  And the gentleman from Iowa certainly pointed out the fact that there  are a lot of promising scenarios out  there. As I go across the Third District  of Nebraska  and  I  visit  operators,  whether they are small or large, it is so  encouraging to see people engaged in  the economy. And as they are engaged,  whether it is at a beef cattle processing  plant or a pork processing plant, or an  ethanol plant, or whether  they are  even creating biodiesel in their garage,  I think there is just tremendous opportunity, and that I believe it is my responsibility to maybe not protect that  opportunity, but to expand that and to  make sure that every producer, every  taxpayer has that opportunity to grow  and, hopefully, make a greater living,  and the government won’t take it all  away from them, and they can reapply  that  through available capital back  into the economy.

182,House,110,-0.045,57,2007-03-23,Mr. TAYLOR.," First let me tell the  gentleman from Georgia I appreciate  him  trying  to  save  some money.  I  think his efforts, though, are a year  late. If you want to look for Katrina  fraud, look for Katrina fraud that was  perpetrated by the Bush administration.  In south Mississippi we had 40,000  people at one point living in FEMA  trailers. We are grateful for every one  of them, but those trailers were delivered by a friend of the President, Riley  Bechtel, a major contributor to the  Bush administration. He got $16,000 to  haul a trailer the last 70 miles from  Purvis, Mississippi down to the gulf  coast, hook it up to a garden hose,  hook it up to a sewer tap and plug it in;  $16,000.  So the gentleman never came to the  floor once last year to talk about that  fraud.  But  now  little  towns  like  Waveland, Bay Saint Louis, Pas Christian, that have no tax base because  their  stores were  destroyed  in  the  storm, a county like Hancock County  where 90 percent of the residents lost  everything,  or  at  least  substantial  damage to their home, he wants to  punish Bay Saint Louis, he wants to  punish Waveland, he wants to punish  Pas Christian.  * * *  ANNOUNCEMENTBYTHEACTINGCHAIRMAN  The Acting CHAIRMAN.

That now has hurt  my feelings. I don’t know how I am  going to be able to get through the day  after the caveman chart. I don’t think  that is even a good likeness of the Senator from North Dakota.  ",2007
184,Senate,110,-0.517,78,2007-03-23,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. President, the  amendment the majority leader and I  are offering today is the first step in  our effort this Congress to undo a fundamental unfairness that affects over  300,000 disabled veterans in this country who also happen to be military retirees. In short, this amendment creates a reserve fund that will allow this  Congress to once and for all eliminate  the offset that exists between military  retiree pay and VA disability benefits.  At a time when we have men and  women in harm’s way in Iraq, Afghanistan and in other locations around the  globe, it is appropriate that the budget  resolution we pass out of the United  States Senate acknowledge and seriously address the unmet needs of our  Nation’s veterans.  It is wrong that our veterans are enduring  long waiting  lines to receive  health care from the VA due to inadequate funding. It is wrong that the  Bush  administration  slammed  the  doors of the VA health care system on  hundreds  of  thousands  of  so-called  ‘‘higher  income’’  veterans—veterans  who in reality make as little as $28,000  a year. And it is wrong for this administration to try to impose higher copayments and enrollment fees on our  veterans. As someone who sits on both  the Budget Committee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, I am incredibly proud that on all these issues, this  budget resolution is on the side of veterans and rejects administration proposals  that  short-change and nickel  and dime those who have served.  The scandal at Walter Reed has highlighted that even here in Washington,  only a short distance from this chamber, some of our servicemembers were  living in sub-standard conditions with  moldy walls, rodents, and holes in the  ceilings. Thankfully, this budget resolution also addresses this outrage.  In addition, this budget resolution  also provides for substantial, new investments in mental health services for  our veterans to help us treat the thousands of veterans returning from the  Iraq War with Post Traumatic Stress  Disorder, PTSD. Also this budget resolution recognizes that we need to significantly increase funding to treat the  large number of  servicemembers  returning with traumatic brain injury.  Finally, this budget resolution  includes an amendment I added in committee  that will allow us  to make  other important improvements to veterans’ programs  later  this year.  In  short, the budget resolution we are  considering is a huge step in the right  direction when it comes to veterans’  health  care and benefits. Chairman  CONRADand his staff deserve tremendous credit for recognizing the very serious needs of our veterans and moving  boldly to address them. I also want to  commend Chairman AKAKAof the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and his staff  for their work and support throughout  this budget process.  Even with  the  tremendous  strides  forward we have made for veterans in  this budget resolution there is one additional  issue  that needs  to be addressed. Today, Senator REIDand I are  offering this amendment to take care  of that very important issue. Before  getting into the details first let me  start off by saying that I am honored  to be working with the majority leader  on this issue. I know that, year after  year, he has been the leading voice in  the Senate to eliminate the Disabled  Veterans Tax. And today, he continues  that leadership with this amendment.  This amendment would create a reserve fund to allow for the elimination  of the remaining offset between military retiree pay and VA disability payments. In my view, this is an issue of  basic fairness. Military retirees earned  their retiree pay based on their long-  term service to the Nation. They earn  their VA disability benefits based on  the disability they acquire or aggravate in the service of their country.  The current offset between these separately-earned benefits originates from  a 19th century law that required a dollar-for-dollar offset of military retired  pay for VA disability compensation. In  my view and the view of millions of  veterans across the country, it is clear  that veterans deserve to receive both  their military retirement which they  receive for their service and their VA  disability payments as additional compensation  for  the  injuries and  lost  earning power due to their service-connected disabilities.  Let me provide just a bit of background on some of the progress Congress has made on this issue in recent  years, thanks in large part to the work  of Senator REID. In the fiscal year 2003  Department of Defense Authorization,  Congress  created  a  special  benefit  called  ‘‘combat-related  special  compensation’’ or CRSC. It expanded it in  the fiscal year 2004 DoD Authorization.  CRSC gives certain combat disabled  veterans a cash benefit equivalent to  what they would receive if full concurrent receipt were allowed.  In the fiscal year 2004 DoD Authorization bill, Congress approved phasing-in concurrent receipt for military  retirees rated as at least 50 percent disabled. The fiscal year 2005 DoD Authorization ended the phase in for 100 percent disabled veterans.  So, today we find ourselves in a situation where retirees who are less than  50 percent disabled are getting no relief  from the Disabled Veterans Tax and  veterans at least 50 percent disabled  but less than 100 percent disabled are  in the middle of the phase period that  will not be complete until 2014. Frankly, if Congress has made the determination that the ban on concurrent receipt  of military retiree pay and VA disability compensation is wrong—and I  think the legislation passed so far demonstrates that Congress has made that  determination—there is no excuse for  making veterans wait for the benefits  that we have acknowledged they are  due. Now  is the time—once and  for  all—we need to eliminate the disabled  veterans tax.  The Reid-Sanders amendment is just  one important step we need to take to  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:25 Sep 11, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\S23MR7.REC S23MR 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 4 2 C P D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2007

186,Senate,110,0.409,106,2007-03-23,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, today I  rise to honor the Madison High School  gymnastics team. On February 16, 2007,  the Lady Bulldogs won the South Dakota Class A State Gymnastics Title.  This  impressive  accomplishment  allowed the Lady Bulldogs to tie the national record of 13 consecutive championship wins. They currently share  the national record with Sehome High  School in Bellingham, WA, who set the  record from 1973 to 1985.  The Lady Bulldogs finished the season with an outstanding performance  at the South Dakota Class A State  Gymnastics Meet. With a final score of  141.893 points they not only tied the national  record  for  consecutive State  championships, but also set a South  Dakota Class A State record. These  two records highlight the talent and  dedication  that  has  characterized  Madison’s  gymnastics  team  for  the  past 13 years.  Head Coach Maridee Dossett  has  demonstrated her allegiance  to  the  Lady Bulldogs both as an athlete and a  coach. She was a senior on the team  that brought home the first State title  for  the Madison  gymnasts  in  1995.  Since that time, she has continued to  contribute to the success of the team  through  her  dedication  and  strong  leadership.  Leading Madison  to  victory was  Katie Finck in the uneven bars and  floor  exercise  categories, and Katie  Breuer in the balance beam, vault and  all around categories. Following the  example set by these two gymnasts,  the Lady Bulldogs illustrated their extraordinary teamwork and successfully  dominated each category of the competition.  I would like to take this opportunity  to honor and thank all those dedicated  to the Madison Central School District:  Head Coach Maridee Dossett, Assistant  Coach Kindra Norby, Athletic Director  Bud  Postma,  Principal  Sharon  Knowlton,  and  Superintendent  Dr.  Frank Palleria. The time and effort put  forth by these individuals have made it  possible for the Lady Bulldogs to be  one of the most successful gymnastics  teams of all time.  I would also  like to recognize the  gymnast’s parents  for  their  support  and devotion to the team. This great  honor was made possible by your encouragement and dedication to your  daughters and their teammates.  Most of all I would like to congratulate the women who won the State  championship this year and all the athletes who have been a part of this  record-tying streak. The gymnasts of  the 2006–2007 Lady Bulldog team, in alphabetical order, are as follows: Katie  Breuer, Kassie Finck, Theresa Knapp,  Katie Mackenzie, Heidi Mogck, Mara  Riedel, Sara Rogers, Kaitlyn Walker,  and Heather Williams.  These  student-athletes  should  be  very  proud  of  their  remarkable  achievements over the past years. The  inspiration of the gymnasts that began  this record success in 1995 has empowered those who have followed in their  footsteps and will continue to bring  motivation to Madison’s student-athletes in the future.  On behalf of the city of Madison and  the State  of South Dakota,  I  am  pleased to say congratulations Lady  Bulldogs on this  impressive national  accomplishment and keep up the great  work.∑  f  HONORING DEPAUW UNIVERSITY’S  WOMEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM  ∑",2007
187,,110,0.585,134,2007-03-23,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Madam Speaker,  since the United States embarked on a mission to rid the world of terrorism, many of our  friends around the world have distanced themselves  from America, hoping  that will shield  them from the wrath the terrorists will one day  bring  to  their countries.  Indonesia has done  the opposite:  the government of  the country  home to the world’s largest population of Muslims has instead forged stronger ties with the  United States.  Recognizing Indonesia’s importance on the  global  stage,  its  government—first  under  Megawati  Soekarnoputri,  and  since  then,  under  the  leadership  of Susilo Bambang  Yudhoyono—has worked  closely with  the  United States  to  fight  terrorism,  and  the  spread of radical Islamism. This alliance has  come at no small cost to the Indonesians, as  terrorists have repeatedly punished Indonesia  by targeting hotels, nightclubs and other tourist attractions with deadly acts of  terrorism.  Nevertheless,  the government of  Indonesia  has not wavered in its commitment, and has  proven itself to be a great friend to the United  States.  As  Indonesia has  supported  the United  States in our Global War against Terrorism, it  is important that the United States continues  to support  Indonesia by recognizing  its sovereignty, and that it doesn’t intervene into Indonesia’s internal matters. The government of  Indonesia has proven itself to be more than  sufficiently mature and responsible to handle  its own internal issues, which relate only to Indonesians, and the United States should respect  its abilities. The government of  Indonesia has shown America that respect, and I  believe we owe it to them to do the same.

Retirees of  the United States Park Police  and  the Secret Service Uniformed Division  who began  their careers before January 1,  1984, were promised  that, upon  retirement,  the would receive increases in their annuities  proportional to pay increases for active duty  servicfmen and women. However,  language  included  into  the 2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act specifically denied this promise to  this group of retirees as a cost-saving measure.  As a  consequence,  these  retirees have  been denied an annuity increase at great personal financial cost, even though they entered  federal uniformed service with  the promise  that these annuities would be there for them  upon retirement. This  is a gross  injustice  to  those who put their lives on the line every day  in service to their country.  That is why we are introducing the Federal  Law Enforcement Pension Adjustment Equity  Act of 2007,  to ensure  that Congress does  what is right, what is just and what is fair. This  legislation is bipartisan and should not be controversial.  It  is my hope  that  this body can  move this bill expeditiously through the legislative process and correct an injustice against  uniformed  federal personnel who have been  willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to serve  our country.  f  NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY  HON. ADRIAN SMITH  OFNEBRASKA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 22, 2007  ",2007
188,,110,0.509,134,2007-03-23,Mr. SMITH of Nebraska.," Madam Speaker,  today is National Agriculture Day. National Agriculture Day occurs every year on  the  first  day of Spring. This is a week when we honor  agriculture  for providing safe, abundant and  affordable  products,  a  strong  economy,  a  source of renewable energy, and a world of  job opportunities.  It goes without saying that agriculture is tremendously important to my district and the nation as a whole, and I hope you join me in  celebrating everyone who works so hard  to  provide for the world.  The Third District of Nebraska is one of the  largest agricultural districts in the country. Our  district  ranks  first  in  the value of sales of  grains and oilseeds, second in total value of  agricultural products sold, and  first  in cattle  and calve inventory.  Simply put: Agriculture matters. National Agriculture Week is about celebrating the impact  the industry has on our State, our Nation, and  our everyday lives. I’m proud to represent the  Third District of Nebraska, a district that truly  embodies the spirit of this celebration.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE MAIL-IN-  BALLOT TRACKING ACT OF 2007  HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 22, 2007  ",2007
189,,110,-0.343,134,2007-03-23,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  introduce  the Mail-In Ballot  Tracking Act of 2007—a bill to implement procedures  for  tracking  the growing number of  ballots  in States  throughout  the country  that  are transmitted through the mail.  Although voters across  the Nation are  increasingly choosing  to cast  their ballots by  mail because it is more convenient and they  have more time to study their choices, many  voters have been hesitant to do so because,  quite frankly, they are worried that they cannot  determine for certain where their mail ballots  are in the system and whether they were actually received and counted.  In most cases, the fears of one’s mail-in ballot somehow being lost in the system are unfounded—but we all know  the  fear  is still  there. Our Nation’s voters deserve electoral  procedures  that are  transparent and which  strengthen their faith in democracy.  Sometimes  there  is reason  for concern.  I  have heard horror stories  from people who  simply did not receive a ballot they requested.  Other voters have called their overwhelmed  elections offices and waited on hold  for  too  long trying to find out whether their ballot has  been mailed or received. Even when they get  to speak with an  informed elections official,  that official often cannot tell the voter where  the ballot is because it is somewhere in the  postal system.  The good news  is  that  it  practical to track mail ballots.  We have been tracking the process of overnight packages for years by using the Internet  and the telephone. There is no reason why we  cannot track ballots using similar technology.  In  fact,  some  jurisdictions  such as San  Mateo County, CA are already tracking ballots  with great success.  The United States Postal Service  is currently introducing an ‘‘Intelligent Mail’’ system  which, if applied to election mail, will allow voters to find out via the Internet or the telephone  which postal processing  facility  last handled  their ballots and when  they were handled  there.  Quite simply, the technology will soon exist  to seamlessly track ballots from the time they  are sent out from the appropriate elections office to the time they are received back and include all the key postal points along the way.  Implementing ballot  tracking systems will  bring voters peace of mind and reduce  the  burden on elections offices which are often  barraged with phone calls from voters trying to  determine the status of their ballots.  This  legislation will also allow a voter  to  know whether his or her ballot passed  the  verification stage and will be counted.  Not only is mail ballot tracking feasible and  helpful, but it is also affordable.  is possible and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:34 Apr 19, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD07\E23MR7.REC E23MR7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007
190,,110,0.229,141,2007-03-23,Mr. CASTLE.," Madam Speaker,  it  is with  great pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute  to Julian H. ‘‘Pete’’ Booker for receiving the  2007 New Castle County Chamber of Commerce Wallace M. Johnson Community Service Award. This great honor has been bestowed upon Mr. Booker for his commendable  efforts to reduce teen automobile crashes in  my home state of Delaware as well as for his  dedication  to numerous other philanthropic  causes.  Julian, better known as Pete, created Delaware’s SMARTDRlVE program, which educates high school students about safe driving  techniques. Through  this program nearly a  dozen local agencies are partnered with more  than two dozen high schools in order to ensure young drivers are able to safely handle  the challenges of being behind the wheel. The  program has achieved great success and has  largely  impacted many people  in Delaware.  This success was recognized  in 2006 when  the program received a national safety award.  Pete is currently finishing his second three-  year term on the United Way of Delaware’s  Board of Directors, where he has volunteered  since 1994. His talents and tireless dedication  to such a worthy cause have facilitated and  enhanced much needed programs  in Delaware communities.  Pete  further demonstrates commitment  to  his community by volunteering a great deal of  time and resources to numerous other charities. The American Red Cross of  the Delmarva Peninsula, the Delaware Association of  Non-Profit Agencies, and Catholic Charities  are but a few causes he has volunteered to  assist.  Pete has also utilized his professional success  to  further  the many causes he champions. As the president and CEO of Delmarva  Broadcasting Company, he is able to donate  generous portions of air-time  to  campaign  thank-you ads as well as underwrite a portion  of United Way’s public events. The state of  Delaware is greatly indebted to Mr. Booker for  his selfless efforts. He has created a charitable  legacy  that has, and will continue  to,  touch many. I would like to congratulate Pete  for receiving the Wallace M. Johnson Community Service Award, I cannot think of a more  deserving recipient.  TRIBUTE TO GREEK  INDEPENDENCE DAY  TRIBUTE TO DELORES FREENY  MAYES  HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, March 23, 2007  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I am  honored to rise today and join the millions of  my fellow Americans in commemorating Greek  Independence Day which, on March 25th celebrates the 186th anniversary of the rebellion  and the struggle of the Greek people against  the Ottoman Empire.  Thomas  Jefferson  referred  to  ancient  Greece as the ‘‘light which led ourselves out  of Gothic darkness.’’ What makes Greek Independence Day so special here in America is  that it reminds us of the strong principles and  bonds  that  the U.S. and Greece share.  In  looking into the struggles of our two nations,  we realize how much our struggles have  in  common, and how much each country has  been influenced by the other.  Greece and the United States are bound by  an absolute commitment  to  the democratic  ideals of justice and freedom and continue to  be strong allies. By commemorating Greek  Independence Day, we also  celebrate  the  strength and the resolve of the human spirit  that has been the inspiration of us all.  On the occasion of the anniversary of Greek  independence, I join all Americans in wishing  the people of Greece congratulations and best  wishes. We will remain eternally grateful to the  Greek  people  and  the  legacy  of  ancient  Greece for the shining example it set for democracies the world over.  f  CHRISTIAN ANDRICK II FOR THE  AWARD OF EAGLE SCOUT  HON.

191,,110,0.367,141,2007-03-23,Mr. BONNER.," Madam Speaker, the city of  Mobile, Alabama, and indeed the entire First  Congressional District,  recently  lost a dear  friend, a talented journalist and a lovely lady,  and I rise today to pay tribute to her memory.  Delores Freeny Mayes—or ‘‘Lowey’’ as she  was known to her many friends—was reared  in Mobile and graduated from Bishop Toolen  High School.  After working  for many years at Mobile’s  Brookley Field, Delores went on to write for  the Mobile Beacon, where she spent the past  25  years providing unique  insights  to her  many faithful readers.  Dubbed the ‘‘Helen Thomas’’ of the south  Alabama press  corps by my predecessor,  former Congressman Sonny Callahan, Delores  was always fair to those she interviewed and  covered. Although she was proud of her chosen profession, she was first—and foremost—  always a lady.  Over the years, Delores had the opportunity  to interview former President Ronald Reagan,  former Alabama Governor George C. Wallace,  Mississippi Senator TRENTLOTT, former Congressman Callahan, as well as his predecessor,  former Congressman Jack Edwards,  not to mention a host of other local, state and  national political figures.  While  she wrote about a wide-array of  issues affecting Mobile and south Alabama,  politics was never far from Delores’ mind, and  she was someone that public officials from all  walks of life knew they could trust.  In recent years, Delores turned her love for  writing into a celebration of her many other talents when she learned to draw and paint. I am  the proud beneficiary of a number of her original etchings and paintings, and at  this particular time when we are celebrating her life,  each one carries a special meaning to me.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues  join me  today  in  recognizing  this beloved  member of the Mobile community.  Delores Mayes will be deeply missed by her  sister, Jeanne Phillips; three brothers, Tommy  Cain, Hubert Cain, and  John Cain; many  nieces and nephews; as well as countless  friends she leaves behind.  Above all else, Delores was a devoted  daughter, sibling, wife and mother. Moreover,  she epitomized what a ‘‘true friend’’ really is.  Our thoughts and prayers are with her family during this difficult time.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF CHRISTINE  CARZO  HON. MICHAEL N. CASTLE  OFDELAWARE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, March 23, 2007  ",2007
192,,110,-0.396,148,2007-03-23,Mr. STUPAK.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to an extraordinary woman who  has made tremendous contributions to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, to the County and City  of Marquette and to Northern Michigan University.  A Marquette native, Phyllis Maki is a graduate of Bishop Baraga High School. She has  spent nearly her entire life in Marquette and,  over the years, Ms. Maki has involved herself  in countless  local community organizations,  winning  the admiration of her  friends and  neighbors as someone upon whom her community could always depend.  Phyllis Maki is active on the Board of the  Lake Superior Community Partnership, which  fosters economic growth throughout Marquette  and surrounding, smaller communities. She  was Treasurer of the Lake Superior Community Partnership and Lake Superior Jobs Coalition. She  represented  the  interests of Marquette City by serving as a ‘‘Marquette County  Ambassador,’’ traveling to Lansing to advocate  for the community before the state House and  Senate and  to bring money back  from  the  state capital to invest in important programs in  the Marquette area. She further helped drive  economic growth in the area by serving on the  board of  the Economic Club of Marquette  County.  She has served on the boards of the Marquette County YMCA, the KI Sawyer Heritage  Museum and the Northern Michigan University  Centennial Committee. She has worked  towards access  to healthcare  for my constituents by serving on the Marquette Community  Access  to Health Care Finance Committee.  She has served as a member of  the U.S.  Olympic Education Committee and the Michigan  Department  of  Transportation  Focus  Group. As one of her  friends recently commented, ‘‘She is involved in everything!’’  She  has  been  recognized with multiple  awards  in  the past,  including  the Athena  Award in 1998, which recognizes excellence  of female leaders in their profession. She herself served  for several years on  the Athena  Board Steering Committee. She also received  the Paul Harris Fellow Award, an International  Rotary Award for assisting others in the community to reach their goals.  An honorary alumna of Northern Michigan  University (NMU), Ms. Maki’s ties to Northern  Michigan University run deep. She has served  many years on the Northern Michigan University Foundation Board of Trustees and as past  president of  this Board of Trustees  for 11  years. She was also a member of NMU’s  Golden Wildcat Club, Blue Line Club and a  member of NMU’s Forest Roberts Theater.  Ms. Maki can perhaps best be described as  ‘‘tireless.’’ In all areas of her life, Phyllis Maki  exhibits a tenacious, irrepressible spirit. While  her involvement in her community demanded  much of her time, she also made time for family: a single parent, she raised  two children  largely on her own.  She is known for waking early in the morning to tackle the day. She would start almost  every morning with a 4:30 a.m. run, finishing  in time to be in her office or in meetings as  early as 6 a.m. Her runs were so notoriously  early that one morning, she is said to have encountered a moose. She was up so early that  the only  living creatures up with her at  that  hour were wildlife!  While she has given freely of her personal  time and raised a family, Ms. Maki was also  able to lead a rich and rewarding career in the  private sector. In February of this year, she retired as the Chief Financial Officer of a local  car dealership. During her 37 years of work  there, she was the driving force in building the  company’s  philanthropic  activities,  encouraging them to regularly donate vehicles to various charities and non-profits. Coincidentally,  the name of her long time employer reflects  Ms. Maki’s altruistic spirit: the car dealership is  called Public Service Garage.  An active member of St. Peter’s Catholic  Church, Ms. Maki’s faith has always been a  strong foundation in her life, providing her the  spiritual endurance  to give so much  to so  many.  Tomorrow, Phyllis Maki will  receive  the  Northern Michigan University President’s Lifetime Achievement Award. This  prestigious  honor  is bestowed upon men and women  whose lives are truly outstanding. As the citation for this award reads, ‘‘A beautiful person  inside and out, she leads with strength and vision and lives with a kind heart and generous  soul. She is the best kind of friend—the forever kind.’’  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and the entire U.S. House of Representatives join me in  saluting my  friend, Ms. Phyllis Maki,  for her  lifetime of contributions and  in wishing her,  Carlo, Deborah, David and Michael all  the  best on this momentous occasion.  f  PUT  ASIDE  PARTISANSHIP  TO  PASS  COMPREHENSIVE  IMMIGRATION REFORM  HON.

193,,110,-0.11,148,2007-03-23,Ms. GIFFORDS.," Madam Speaker,  I am  pleased that we in the House of Representatives finally have a comprehensive immigration  reform bill that we can debate, and I am proud  to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation  authored by Congressman GUTIERREZ and  Congressman FLAKE.  Members in this chamber now have the opportunity to pass a bill that will secure the border and end our nation’s  illegal  immigration  crisis.  Given that the challenge of illegal immigration is complex, the solution must address all  aspects of this problem—border security, the  hiring of illegal immigrants, labor shortages in  certain sectors of our economy, and the millions of illegal immigrants currently living in the  United States.  A piecemeal approach will simply not work.  If we truly want to end illegal immigration, the  only option  is  to pass a comprehensive bill  that is tough, practical, and effective.  I stand here today ready to work with members of both parties, ready to listen to everyone’s concerns, and steadfast in my conviction  that,  if we can put aside partisanship and  compromise with each other, we can reach an  agreement.  In my district in southern Arizona, the need  for reform is critical. In 2006, 4,000 illegal immigrants a day crossed  the border  into Arizona. Our schools, hospitals, and law enforcement agencies are overwhelmed. Our environment and homeland security are threatened.  In the weeks ahead, I will be holding several  forums on this legislation in my district, so I  can receive  feedback  from  the  folks on  the  front lines of the immigration crisis. After listening  to a range of experts and  local residents,  I will  recommend possible  improvements before we vote on this bill.  f  WOODROW WILSON PRESIDENTIAL  LIBRARY  HON.

194,,110,0.495,148,2007-03-23,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  today to introduce legislation that will establish  the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library  in  Staunton, Virginia.  In studying  the  life and  times of  the 28th President, we see how  Woodrow Wilson affected and continues to influence how the United States responds to national and international crises. This bill is identical to legislation that passed on the House  floor by Voice Vote  in  the 109th Congress  September 28, 2006.  As a statesman, scholar, and President,  Woodrow Wilson faced economic crisis, democratic decay, and a world war. Presidential historians agree that World War I, and President  Wilson’s leadership, radically altered the role  of diplomacy as a tool of foreign policy—a policy that established a new path for America’s  role in promoting democracies throughout the  world. So too did Wilson’s high-minded ideals  craft a legacy that shaped the powers and responsibilities of the executive branch in times  of war.  As a professor and president of Princeton  University, Wilson created a more selective  and accountable system for higher education.  By instituting curriculum reform, Wilson revolutionized  the  roles of  teachers and students  and quickly made Princeton one of the most  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:34 Apr 19, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD07\E23MR7.REC E23MR7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

196,House,110,0.551,24,2007-03-29,Mr. HERGER.," Madam Chair, I rise in  strong opposition to the alternative  budget before us now and the Democrat  budget. The Democrat majority party  seems intent on raising taxes and increasing spending. American families,  seniors, and small businesses would all  experience major tax hikes. Virtually  no American would be spared.  The budget before us ignores the benefits of the tax relief passed since 2001.  This tax relief has spurred economic  growth and created literally millions  of new jobs. Meanwhile, tax revenue to  the Federal Treasury is surging, helping to reduce the deficit. Their budget  also ignores the out-of-control growth  in entitlement spending. This is deeply  irresponsible. The tax-tax/spend-spend  philosophy  supported by my  friends  across the aisle is bad economics and  bad  for  the American people. Vote  ‘‘no.’’  ",2007
197,House,110,-0.652,24,2007-03-29,Mr. FILNER.," I thank the gentlelady,  and  I  thank  the  leadership of Ms.  WOOLSEYand Ms. LEEof the Progressive Caucus.  Madam Chair, I rise this morning as  the Chair of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee in proud support of  the Progressive Caucus budget.  Other budgets  fund  the war;  this  budget funds the warrior. I am going to  repeat that: Other budgets  fund the  war; this budget funds the warrior.  Most of us in the Progressive Caucus  are against the war in Iraq, but we are  united  in our view that when these  young men and women come home and  all the other young men and women  who came home in the past, that they  get all the care, the support, the honor,  the dignity, the love that a grateful  Nation can bestow.  We are united in saying we will honor  those who come home. They have done  everything we have asked, they have  been brave and courageous, they have  had incredible wounds both physically  and mentally, and we are going to give  them the care, love, respect, and honor  that they deserve.  This  is the only budget before us  today that says we will have what is  called  ‘‘mandatory  funding’’ of veterans health care. Mandatory funding  means we don’t have to wait 5 months  like the Republicans did last year when  they didn’t fund the Veterans Administration for the first 5 months of the fiscal year. Assured funding, mandatory  funding, means that they will be funded on the first day of the fiscal year,  and they will get automatic funding  that doesn’t have to go through a political fight.  We have a President that says support the troops, support the troops,  support the troops. The speakers on  the other side say support the troops,  support the troops, support the troops.  But when they get home, who is supporting them? Who is supporting these  brave young men and women when  they come back? We saw what happened at Walter Reed. We saw what  happened to Bob Woodruff when he had  traumatic brain injury—and those who  were less fortunate than he didn’t get  the treatment they needed. We heard  about the young marine who went to a  Minnesota  hospital  saying  he  had  PTSD and was thinking about committing suicide, and they said he was number 28 on the waiting list, come back in  a month. He went home and he committed suicide. That is not a Veterans  Administration, that is not a country  that is welcoming its troops home. It is  time that we fund the warrior and not  just the war. Vote for the Progressive  Caucus budget.  ",2007

This debate today could be described  as a debate about the good, the bad,  and the ugly. A kinder way you could  describe it is the responsible, the irresponsible, and the reckless.  We are going to have the House Republican budget brought  forward on  this floor today, brought forward by  our chairman, Mr. RYAN, a responsible  budget, a good budget, a budget that  comes to balance in 5 years without  raising taxes and tries to address the  challenge that we face in the category  of entitlements.  We have  the Democrat  leadership  budget that is going to be brought forward, a budget that has the biggest tax  increase in our Nation’s history, and a  budget, I might add, that not only includes significant increases in spending, but as well makes no effort to deal  with the challenge of entitlements.

200,House,110,-0.432,52,2007-03-29,Ms. DEGETTE.," Mr. Chairman,  strong support of H. Con. Res. 99.  For the last 6 years we have been swimming in serious red ink. Deep red ink. Thanks  to President Bush and  the Republicans  in  Congress we have added almost three trillion  dollars to our Nation’s debt. This red ink also  seemed  to be without end.  In  the past  the  other side of the aisle put forward budgets that  did not reflect a serious commitment  to responsible  fiscal policy. Those budgets also  failed to reflect the priorities of the American  people.  Well, Mr. Chairman, Congress is under new  management. That new management has produced a budget  for  the House  to consider  about which  the American people can be  proud.  The Democratic budget  is  fiscally responsible.  It  reimposes pay-as-you-go  (PAYGO)  budgeting principles and achieves balance in  2012. At the same time, this budget puts our  priorities in the proper order.  For example, it provides tax relief to those  who it needs it most—the middle-class. This  tax relief includes the extension of certain tax  breaks, such as the child tax credit, and reform of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).  This budget also increases spending on the  things that matter most to the American people, such as our children, education, health  care, and veterans. Today we will be providing  for a $50 billion increase in funds to provide  health insurance to millions of more uninsured  kids. Education, training, and related programs  will receive three billion more than current levels and almost eight billion more  than  requested by  the President. Funding  for veterans’ health care services  is  increased by  14.4 percent.  I am proud to support this budget. It reflects  a responsible fiscal position and puts our limited resources towards programs and policies  that are important to this nation. I encourage  all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H. Con.  Res. 99.  ",2007
201,House,110,0.639,52,2007-03-29,Mr. SALI.," Mr. Chairman, today Members of  Congress  faced  two budget resolutions. The  choice is a clear one between bigger, more  expensive  and more  intrusive  government  versus fiscal discipline based on key priorities.  Now, fiscal discipline is hard, which is why  it is not always popular. It is easy for some to  vote to increase government spending, but ultimately someone must pay for it. It is common  to hear about  the  ‘‘government’’ doing  this project or that project. We hear a lot about  the  ‘‘government’’ spending money, but we  must not allow the idea of ‘‘government’’ doing  something to lead us to forget that, ultimately,  ‘‘We the People’’ are the ones who have to  pay for what government does. The nineteenth  century economist Frederic Bastiat once said  that ‘‘government is the great fiction through  which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.’’  Although  the Federal Government  is not  known for its fiscal discipline, we are now facing a budget that exceeds even the most fevered  imaginings of history’s biggest spenders. It would enact the largest tax increase in  history—an almost $400 billion increase.  This  is one path, and  it  is  the one down  which the new Majority proposes to take us.  We also had the opportunity to take another  path, a roadway to a balanced budget without  raising taxes on working Americans.  The choice is clear. The Democratic budget  would do serious harm to Idahoans, their families and  their businesses. The Democratic  budget would: Raise  taxes on 436,000  Idahoans who benefit from the current 10 percent  tax bracket; force 176,000 married couples in  Idaho to pay for an increase in the marriage  tax penalty; force 133,000 Idahoans with children to pay higher taxes because of the expiration of the current child tax credit; and raise  tax rates on capital gains and dividends  for  74,000 Idaho investors, including Idaho senior  citizens.  The Democrats are demanding  that hardworking Idahoans further subsidize the already  bulging government coffers. More  than  that,  the reckless increases in entitlement spending  included in their bill would require that generations to come pay for our present unwillingness to make tough decisions.  As many know but few heed, the explosive  rate of entitlement spending is simply not sustainable. If the current rate of federal entitlement spending remains unabated, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will consume  20 percent of the Nation’s economy annually  by 2040. If trends continue, entitlements will  take up over 60 percent of the entire Federal  budget in less than a decade. Our Nation is  one of great prosperity, but no nation can expect to maintain economic and political greatness by feeding government programs at the  expense of working families.  Few will  be  untouched  by  this  vicious  money-grab. Seniors, married couples, parents,  small business owners,  lower-income  earners—all will be forced to turn over more of  their earnings to the Federal Government.  In contrast, I support the Republican-offered  substitute  budget.  The Republican  budget  reaches a balanced budget by 2012, but retains the important tax cuts adopted in 2001  and 2003. The Republican budget does not  arbitrarily raise the 10 percent bracket to 15  percent;  it preserves  the current 10 percent  rate. Lower-income earners need that money  more than the government does. The Republican budget: Stops raiding the Social Security  surplus; reins-in unsustainable, runaway entitlement spending by slowing the rate of annual  entitlement spending growth,  thereby saving  money for the taxpayers; prepares for the future by budgeting  in advance  for national  emergencies and crises; refines and strengthens the so-called ‘‘pay as you go’’ (PAYGO)  rules to require that spending increases be offset with spending  reductions  instead of  increasing  taxes; caps discretionary spending  through  2010  so Congress  cannot  simply  throw more money at problems  that require  real solutions.  In short, we in Congress are accountable to  our constituents. We must remember that real  people and their livelihoods are at stake back  home. If we wish to help those back in our  districts, we must bear in mind that we do not  have all  the answers here  in Washington.  Congress did not earn the money that we took  in taxes. It was hard-working Americans that  earned it. If we fail to make the direly-needed  tough choices about  runaway spending, we  are merely fostering a tax-and-spend culture  that demands our constituents make pay a  greater sacrifice in their earnings.  This is an unacceptable demand to make.  Thankfully,  the President has said he would  veto the Democratic bill. Yet unless Congress  begins to take seriously the need for economic  growth,  tax  reduction  for  families and balancing the Federal budget, relying on the nation’s Chief Executive to exercise his veto pen  is like depending on a child to put his finger  in the leak of a dyke. It will only work for a  short time. We’ve got to do better, soon.  ",2007
202,House,110,-0.272,52,2007-03-29,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Chairman, Federal budgets  reflect our values as a nation. This Nation has  rejected passing the monumental debt run up  by this administration and past congresses on  to their children. We are bringing a new fiscal  direction to our budgeting process.  Correcting the fiscal course of the country  will not be easy, or fast. We did it before, but  success only comes with  the hard work of  passing budget and appropriations bills every  year . . . unlike the way past Congresses did  it: not paying the bills, running up huge waves  of debt in the form of higher taxes on our children. We’re about to start doing this right.  Our fiscal outlook deteriorated dramatically  over the past 6 years. In 2001, the administration inherited a projected 10-year (2002–2011)  budget surplus of $5.6 trillion. After paying for  tax cuts for the richest among us, that surplus  was gone. Between that and the 9–11 attacks,  the United States accumulated a mountain of  debt, adding $2.8 trillion to our Federal debt  burden since 2001. Most of this debt has been  purchased by  foreign  investors, making  the  U.S. economy more vulnerable  to economic  and political  instability and political pressure  from abroad.  Deficits matter. It is our moral responsibility  to start cleaning up the fiscal chaos wrought  by the last Congresses and the President. Living beyond our means comes at a cost to our  children and grandchildren who will have  to  pay off that debt. The irresponsible economic  policies of the past 6 years have left a debt  burden of $29,075 for a typical middle-income  family of four in Texas.  Deficits also hurt economic growth by slowing down national savings, which  leaves us  less to invest in our future. That means lower  productivity and wages for future workers. The  President’s budget continued  the  fiscal approach that has brought us large deficits and  growing debt.  This budget is in sharp contrast to the trend  of spending our children’s money  like mad.  Today’s budget takes the necessary steps to  eliminate our long-term budget deficit by adhering to the pay-as-you-go principle, just as  families at kitchen tables do every day across  the country.  A balanced budget must  include balanced  priorities. For the first time in 6 years, the congressional budget resolution will balance the  Federal budget—in 2012—while also defending our country, delivering critical services to  children and families, caring for our veterans,  educating our children, and growing the U.S.  economy.  The 2008 budget is the blueprint for the new  direction we are taking the American people.  It provides greater deficit reduction  than  the  administration in the first 5 years, leading to a  budget surplus in 2012 . . . we pay for the  budget as we go, not as we hope we’ll have  a windfall of money . . .

211,Senate,110,0.496,185,2007-03-29,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, I rise to  introduce the Workforce Health  Improvement Program Act of 2007, otherwise known as the WHIP Act. This bipartisan bill I introduce today is the  same  legislation I  introduced  in the  109th Congress. I am very pleased to be  joined again by my good friend and colleague,  Senator  HARKIN, who  shares my  commitment  to  helping  keep America fit.  Public health experts unanimously  agree that people who maintain active  and healthy lifestyles dramatically reduce their risk of contracting chronic  diseases. And as the government works  to reign in the high cost of health care,  it is worth talking about what we all  TOM can do to help ourselves. As you know,  prevention is key, and exercise is a primary component in the prevention of  many adverse health conditions that  can arise over one’s lifetime. A physically fit population helps to decrease  health-care costs, reduce governmental  spending, reduce illnesses, and improve  worker productivity.  According to the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC), the economic cost alone to businesses in the  form of health insurance and absenteeism is more that $15 billion. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid programs  currently spend $84 billion annually on  five major chronic diseases: diabetes,  heart disease, depression, cancer, and  arthritis.  Reports also show that only about 15  percent  of  adults  perform  the  recommended amount of physical activity, and 40 percent of adults do not participate in any physical activity. With  physical inactivity being a key contributing factor to overweight and obesity, and adversely affecting workforce  productivity, we quite simply need to  do more to help employers encourage  exercise.  Given the tremendous benefits exercise provides, I believe Congress has a  duty to create as many incentives as  possible  to  get Americans  off  the  couch, up, and moving.  With this in mind, I am introducing  the WHIP Act.  Current  law already permits businesses to deduct the cost of on-site  workout facilities, which are provided  for the benefit of employees on a pre-  tax basis. But if a business wants or  needs to outsource these health benefits, they and/or their employees are  required to bear the full cost. In other  words, employees who receive off-site  fitness center subsidies are required to  pay income tax on the benefits, and  their employers bear the associated administrative costs of complying with  the IRS rules.  The WHIP Act would correct this inequity in the tax code to the benefit of  many smaller businesses and their employees. Specifically, it would provide  an employer’s right to deduct up to  $900 of the cost of providing health club  benefits off-site for their employees. In  addition, the employer’s contribution  to the cost of the health club  fees  would not be taxable income for employees creating an incentive for more  employers to contribute to the health  and welfare of their employees.  The WHIP Act is an important step  in  reversing  the  largely preventable  health crisis that our country is facing,  through the promotion of physical activity and disease prevention. It is a  critical component of America’s health  care policy: prevention. It will improve  our nation’s quality of  life by promoting  physical  activity  and  preventing disease. Additionally,  it will  help  relieve pressure on a  strained  health care system and correct an inequity in the current tax code.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 1038  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

Importantly, it gives tribute to hundreds of  thousands of people who have died from  exposure.  To me, this resolution is very personal Deaths from exposure to asbestos  are common in my home State of Montana—all too common. Libby, MT is a  small community in the western part  of Montana. Libby  is a very unique  place.  It is surrounded by the beauty and  splendor of the Cabinet Mountains. But  it is also plagued with sickness and disease. The extent of asbestos contamination in Libby, the number of people  who are sick, the amount of people who  have died from asbestos exposures just  staggering.  The community of Libby suffers from  asbestos related diseases at 40 to 60  times higher than the rest of the country. Folks in Libby are diagnosed with  mesothelioma, the deadly form of cancer from asbestos, at 100 times higher  than the average rate.  Mesothelioma recently took the life  of a very dear  friend of mine  from  Libby—Les Skramstad.  Just  a  few  weeks ago, I came to the floor to talk  about Les and how he was an outspoken advocate for Libby.  Until the day he died, Les worked  tirelessly to share his story and the  story of Libby’s quiet emergency.  The first night I met Les in January  of 2000, he challenged me to help all  those in Libby suffering from asbestos-  related diseases. Les challenged me ‘‘to  do something.’’  He said: MAX, please, as a man like  me—as someone’s father too, as someone’s husband, as someone’s son, help  me. Help us.

Leavitt, S.S.,  commend him for his 27 years of service as  President-Rector of St. Mary’s Seminary and  University  in Baltimore, Maryland, and wish  him well in his retirement.  In 1962, Father Leavitt began his philosophical and theological studies at St. Mary’s  and has since remained fully dedicated to the  spirit of  the seminary.  In 1968, he was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Hartford,  Connecticut and appointed to the faculty of St.  Mary’s.  His ability to articulate a compelling vision  for the seminary led to his being elected the  fourteenth President and first President-Rector  of St. Mary’s, a position he has held longer  than anyone in the seminary’s proud 215–year  history.  Saint Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of  San Francisco, was once asked what a person had to do to lead a good life, to which he  replied, ‘‘Preach the Gospel. Sometimes use  words.’’ Father Leavitt has done  just  that,  preaching by example to generations of students.  As President-Rector, Father Leavitt has presided over construction and rebeautification efforts of the seminary as well as successfully  enlarged the endowment to ensure the long-  term viability of the institution. He has worked  to expand the spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral resources necessary to prepare students  for the priesthood.  As a philosopher, theologian, teacher, and  preacher, he has re-energized the St. Mary’s  community and  instilled a sense of principle  and potential to our nation’s first Catholic seminary.  It is an honor for me to congratulate Father  Leavitt  for his  tireless commitment  to education, faith, and leadership and recognize the  truly exemplary impact he has made within our  greater faith community. I wish him well in his  retirement.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF BRIGADIER  GENERAL WILLIAM J. SHARROW  HON. DON YOUNG  OFALASKA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2007  ",2007
215,,110,0.278,241,2007-03-29,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Madam Speaker,  today I wish to honor Brigadier General William J. Sharrow—a truly great American. Bill  has  tirelessly served  this country  for many  years, managing some of our country’s important military  programs. Most  recently, Bill  served as my State Director, where he dedicated himself to tirelessly working for the people of Alaska.  Born in Witherbee, New York on August 19,  1932, Bill entered  the Army  in 1952. He  served with the 867th AAA Battalion at Fort  Richardson, Alaska until his discharge in November 1954. He returned home to New York  and joined an Army Reserve Unit. However,  he realized his heart was back in Alaska and  returned a short time later to make Alaska his  permanent home. Bill joined the Alaskan Army  National Guard where he served as First Sergeant of Company D, 207th Infantry Battalion  until he was commissioned in November 1956.  Some of Bill’s many roles  in  the National  Guard include: radio repairman, supply officer,  administrative assistant, personnel officer and  Command Administrative Assistant to the Adjutant General. His military assignments range  from platoon leader to battalion commander.  He served as Chief of Staff  for  the Alaska  Army National Guard from 1972 to 1974 and  was appointed as Assistant Adjutant General  on February 7, 1974. Bill’s dedication to our  Nation was federally recognized on June 25,  1974 when he was promoted  to Brigadier  General.  During his 20 plus years of service to Alaska and to his country, Bill remained a strong  leader who set an example of achievement  that was  unmatched. He  represented  the  United States with honor and dignity and continuously strove for excellence. The loss to the  United States the day Bill left his post, was a  great gain to me and to all Alaskans.  Bill worked for me for 24 years as my State  Director. When I was unable to attend an important function or meeting, it was Bill that I always be trusted to represent me. We share a  common love of Alaska and its people and it  was comforting for me to know that when work  forced me to remain in Washington, Bill would  always be there to listen to the Alaskan people and keep them informed of our work.  Bill has been happily married  to Margaret  for 52 years and is the father of 3 sons: David  who lives in Anchorage, AK; Phillip who lives  in Auckland, New Zealand; and Steven who  lives in Fairbanks, AK. He is also the grandfather to 6 grandchildren. I know that Bill is  looking forward to spending more time with his  family and traveling around the world with the  love of his life, Marg.  Bill has always provided sage advice to colleagues and staff and done so with quick wit  and much humor. Bill was an invaluable employee and he will be sorely missed but he  continues to be a dear friend and confidant. I  will miss his daily leadership and guidance but  know that our friendship will endure. My wife  Lu and I wish him and Marg all the best as  they embark on this new chapter of their lives.

Mr. President, I wish to commend the  distinguished Senators from Iowa and  Pennsylvania on their passion for stem  cell research, which is shared by virtually all the people whom I know.

219,Senate,110,-0.4,34,2007-04-10,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Mr. President, I  thank the distinguished Senator from  Iowa.  I speak today in support of S. 5, the  Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act,  offered  by  the majority  leader,  to  whom we all owe a debt of gratitude for  bringing  this  important bill  to  the  floor. As a new Member of this body, as  is the Presiding Officer, it also gives  me great pride to express my appreciation for the leadership of Senator HARKIN, Senator SPECTER, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator HATCH, whose voices  over the years have placed us in the position to pass this legislation, as I hope  we will tomorrow.  I also wish to recognize the exceptional work and extraordinary leadership of my colleague and friend from  The  to  Rhode Island, Congressman JIMLANGEVIN. Congressman LANGEVINhas been  both a State and national leader on  this issue, championing the passage of  H.R. 810 in last year’s Congress and of  H.R. 3 in January, as well as playing an  integral role  in Rhode Island’s stem  cell dialogue. Just today he was with  our  Lieutenant Governor  Elizabeth  Roberts, as she issued her report, ‘‘Discovering Rhode Island’s Stem Cell Future:  Charting  the  Course  Toward  Health and Prosperity.’’ This report is  an important step toward developing a  comprehensive statewide plan for stem  cell research initiatives in Rhode Island.  Congressman LANGEVINdid not arrive  at his position on stem cell research  easily. He grappled, as we all do, with  the ethical and scientific  issues  involved, meeting with a host of individuals and groups spanning the ideological spectrum. After serious and heartfelt  consideration, he  concluded, as  have many of our Senate colleagues,  that a central part of his deeply held  beliefs about life is a commitment to  those who are challenged by diabetes,  by heart disease, by Alzheimer’s, by  Parkinson’s, by spinal cord injury, by  stroke, and by the myriad of diseases  and conditions that stem cell research  might help or even cure. I share this  deep commitment to stem cell research  and a sincere optimism about the hope  it offers for so many lives.  I want to share the story of one of  those lives. It is the story of Lila Barber, a 12-year-old girl from Westerly,  RI, who came to visit me here in Washington 2 weeks ago. In 2005, Lila started experiencing pain in her leg. The  pain got progressively worse over a 5-  month period, until it was keeping her,  and her parents, up all night. The Barbers began a medical  journey,  from  doctor to doctor and test to test, only  to be told that Lila had bursitis. As it  turned out, Lila did not have bursitis;  she had  osteosarcoma,  a  cancerous  bone tumor on her tibia below her  knee.  Years ago, doctors would have had no  option but to amputate Lila’s leg. But  reconstructive  techniques  have  improved, and most limbs can now be replaced with a metal and plastic artificial joint or a cadaver bone transplant.  Fortunately, Dr. Richard Terek, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in musculoskeletal oncology at Brown University, was able to save her leg using  such a cadaver bone transplant, which  preserves as much normal tissue as  possible. In the year following Lila’s  surgery, she was home-schooled as she  underwent 16 rounds of chemotherapy.  Lila’s chances of  long-term survival  are now good—75 percent.  But even if Lila remains cancer free,  she will  face a painful and ongoing  medical struggle. Since the donor bone  and cartilage are not  living, Lila’s  transplanted tibia will not grow as she  does. Even worse, it will break down  over time. This is a place where stem  cell research could vastly improve care  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:35 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S10AP7.REC S10AP7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007

Ladies and gentlemen, we have here a  very  interesting constitutional question. My good friend and distinguished  member of the Judiciary Committee I  think  has  raised  four, maybe  five  points that disturb him greatly, but  the main one is that it is unconstitutional. The point of the matter is that  there are those who think it is constitutional and those who think it is  unconstitutional.  Can’t we  let  the  courts decide this besides 435 great lawyers working on this?  Mr. Speaker, I now yield 3 minutes to  the distinguished gentleman from Alabama, ",2007
224,House,110,-0.27,19,2007-04-19,Mr. DAVIS of Alabama.," Mr. Speaker,  I thank the distinguished Chair of the  committee for honoring me by giving  me a chance to speak during this momentous debate.  And I want to begin with a simple observation. If you scour the globe and  you look at the places that are listed  as democracies, the places where the  consent of the governed is what drives  the politics, there is not a single one  where the people who live in the capital do not have a representative to  their parliamentary body. No, not one.  That is telling, and it ought to frame  everything that we say here today because the system of government in this  country and the way we have gone  about business until now has been  unique in the world. This is the only  place in the world where the people  who live in the capital have no voice.  Now, let me speak to some of the  constitutional  arguments  that  have  been raised. I find it very telling, Mr.  Speaker, that many of my very able  colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have spent a lot of time in their recommit motion and other places, making a  point about the recent D.C. Circuit ruling about the right to bear arms. They  have brought that unrelated issue into  this debate.  But it is interesting for this reason,  and I take out this dog-eared copy of  the Constitution. If there is one document that ought to be well worn, I suppose it is the Constitution.  If you  look at the second amendment, Mr. Speaker and Mr. Chairman,  that our opponents in this debate rely  on, it says ‘‘A well regulated militia  being necessary to the security of a  free State, the right of the People to  keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,’’ a clear-cut reference to the  security of a free State.  Our friends on the other side of the  aisle say that  is relevant to Washington, D.C. They say there is a right  to bear arms  that  the people  shall  enjoy. If it is so in the context of someone carrying around a 9 millimeter or a  semiautomatic, it must be so in the  context of people walking into a ballot  and voting for a delegate who is a representative who has a voice here.  What kind of a system of government  says that the right to have a 9 millimeter outweighs the right to vote? You  can’t have it both ways in this argument. You can’t say you throw out the  State in the second amendment, but  somehow you make the State giant and  bold and capitalized and italicized in  the context of this representation.  Another  point  that Mr. NADLER  touched upon: We hear from the opposition that D.C. is a special thing, a Federal district, that  it  is neither the  United States nor the States so, therefore, it belongs in its own special category. If that is the case, to my friends  on the other side, take out your copy  of the Constitution, plow your way  through  it, and  look at amendment  after amendment. If that  interpretation is so, that D.C. is not a State or  the U.S. Government,  it means  the  equal protection clause doesn’t apply  to Washington, D.C. It means that the  antipoll tax provision doesn’t apply to  Washington, D.C. It means that every  other provision of  the Constitution  that  contains  the word  ‘‘State’’ or  ‘‘U.S.’’ does not apply.  No one makes that argument that  the people of Washington, D.C. are utterly shorn of rights because they are  neither a State nor the United States.  If you don’t make it in another context, you cannot make it in this one.  ",2007
225,House,110,0.495,19,2007-04-19,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself 30 seconds to respond to  the gentleman from Alabama.  The second amendment to the Constitution refers to the ‘‘State.’’ When  the  Constitution  refers  to  the  ‘‘States,’’ meaning  today  50 States,  then 13 States, it is referring to them  in the plural. The ‘‘State’’ in the second amendment refers to the country  collectively.  And to the distinguished chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, for whom I  have great respect but also great disagreement on this issue, I hope that  given the fact that we do acknowledge  a difference of opinion on what the  Constitution says means that he will  join with us in seeking for expedited  judicial review if, as I hope is not the  case, this should be passed and sent to  the courts for their review.  Mr. Speaker,  at  this  time  I  am  pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey  (Mr. GARRETT).  ",2007
226,House,110,-0.401,26,2007-04-19,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, we had distinguished speakers on both sides of  this issue argue the constitutionality  in the Judiciary Committee, both conservative and liberal members on each  side, and they both gave arguments it  was constitutional.  In baseball, the tie goes to the runner, and it goes to the runner because  the runner is trying to make an advancement, trying to score, trying to  make progress. And I would submit,  Mr. Speaker, that this is progress. This  is an advancement to allow the enfranchisement of these people who have  been denied the vote and their ancestors for many years. The tie should go  to the runner, we should pass this bill,  and I am proud to vote for it today.  ",2007

Mr. Leader, the minority side has  been talking about PAYGO rules and  that somehow we have violated them.  They sound very convincing. And as  you know,  the  fiscally conservative  Blue Dog Coalition are also strong supporters of the PAYGO rule, as are all  members of our Democratic Caucus.  This pay-as-you-go rule was an important step in restoring fiscal discipline  in Congress. The Members of the Blue  Dog Coalition believe it is important  that the House comply with this rule.  Can you explain how this bill complies with PAYGO and specifically, for  the benefit of the Members on both  sides, I ask, will the PAYGO rule that  we established in January be fulfilled  when the House completes action on  the District of Columbia Voting Rights  Act?

Following several earlier impasses, I want to  take this opportunity to commend the spirit of  bipartisanship and compromise on this important measure. I hope it extends to a bicameral  bipartisanship in the weeks to come.  This bill benefits all Americans and  their  families who use and enjoy our Nation’s waterways, public beaches—including over 300  miles of coastline along my district—and  for  U.S. businesses that depend on healthy and  viable waterways throughout the country.  My district benefits from the good work that  the Army Corps of Engineers does for coastal  communities by helping small towns deal with  multiple  concerns  ranging  from erosion  to  longstanding environmental challenges. The  Corps is currently working on several projects  on eastern Long Island that will dredge inlets,  restore  damaged  ecosystems,  and  study  coastal health.  In addition, H.R. 1495 will go a long way toward supplying  the Corps with all  the  resources  it needs  to protect coastal communities and vacationers by modernizing project  planning and approval.  Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the Chairman and  Ranking Member again for their hard work on  this issue, and I look forward to working with  my colleagues  to make sure  that we get a  WRDA bill  to  the President as soon as we  can.

236,House,110,0.527,124,2007-04-19,Mr. WALBERG.," You raised a  good point. It has only been 100 days,  and in less than 100 days, the largest  tax  increase  in America has  taken  place.  During the campaign, you heard from  both parties, you heard what people  said they would do. In less than 100  days, they were broken.  If you happen to be sitting at home  and you are married, you have some  children, you are going to pay more. If  you are elderly, you are going to pay  more. If you happen to maybe seek the  opportunity of America, worked hard,  made a business, saved, bought some  land and went forward, you happened  to pass away, this majority party, the  Democrats, want to take 55 percent of  that. That is the difference.  I appreciate your principled view, let  people keep their hard-earned money,  and make sure that you bring accountability back.  Now we want to go to another place  in middle America because  that  is  where solutions are. We want to get an  update from Ohio. In Ohio, you can find  a lot of individuals, but you can’t find  someone who works harder. Congressman JIMJORDAN, along with his wife,  Polly; I think they hold the American  dream.  b2245  They are doing a fantastic job of raising their own children. They reach out  into this community. They help others  and make sure they are able to have a  place to stay, a place a work and place  for education. But JIM, Congressman  JORDAN is the only Republican freshman to get placed on Judiciary. Why?  Because of his work, not only as an attorney, but his work in the Senate in  Ohio, that stood out across this Nation.  And I want you to give us an update.  Talk a little further more about taxes  and what this 100 days have meant to  America and how much this Democratic Party is going to reach into your  pocket.  ",2007
237,House,110,0.706,124,2007-04-19,Mr. JORDAN of Ohio.," Well, I thank  the gentleman for yielding some time  and for his work in putting this together and his passion and intensity  and energy that he brings to the Congress and what he has done  in our  freshman class.  I appreciate the remarks of  the previous  speaker. He  talked about Tax Day, and he is right  on target when you think about the  amount of money government takes.  And I just want to start with a question. And there is probably a few people watching, probably mostly in the  gentleman  from California’s district.  Most people in Ohio are smart enough  to get in bed at this hour. But there are  a few people watching out there. And I  just want to ask those Americans who  are watching, do you think government  has enough of your money already, or  do you think they need more? And my  guess is the vast majority of people in  California who are watching, or in Ohio  who are sleeping, understand that the  government, the billions and billions  and the trillions and trillions that the  government takes in already is probably enough.  And the gentleman  from Michigan  was great in outlining what is at stake  and what the Democrats want to do,  because the Democrats obviously think  different. The American people think,  you know what, the government probably takes enough of my money. But  based on what took place 2 weeks ago  with the budget that was passed by the  majority party, over the next 3 years  the spending they want to do is going  to take more and more money out of  the private sector, where good things  happen in our economy, where jobs are  created, where prosperity takes place,  more and more money out of the private sector and more money from the  families across this great country, in  Ohio, in the Fourth District, and across  the Nation as whole.  So I just want to provide some perspective and context and  framework  for why that is a bad thing. And I think  we just start with this basic premise:  the stakes are high today. It is important that the elected officials, the politicians here in Congress, get it right  for a change. There was a point in the  past where, in spite of bad policies that  the  politicians may  have  enacted,  America, because we were so uniquely  positioned coming out of World War II,  we were the economic superpower. We  were the economy that was growing. It  didn’t really matter if bad public policy was put in place. We were going to  excel. We were going to prosper in this  world market  in spite of the things  that the politicians might have done.  But today the stakes are high and  the competition is stiffer. And I just  want to give some facts and figures and  I will yield back to the gentleman from  California. But recognize the  framework we are in. Today, China has 1.4  billion people. India has close to 800  million people. Those two countries,  over two billion people. United States  of America, we just hit 300 million population last summer. Those two economies, China and India, over two billion  people combined  in those two countries, China’s economy is growing at  approximately  10  percent  annual  growth rate. India is growing at about  7,  71⁄2 percent  annual  growth  rate,  quickly moving towards middle class.  The competition is stiffer. And it is important today when you think about  those numbers, those facts, those figures, that we in elective office do the  policies right.  Raising  taxes on business owners,  raising taxes on families, $400 billion,  as  the  gentleman  from  California  pointed out, doing those things makes  it tougher for our families, our small  business owners, our economy to compete in that world market. And that is  why it is important we not go along  with these tax increases. That is why it  is important we try to keep those tax  cuts that are in place, so that family  and businesses can prosper. It is that  fundamental.  The  gentleman  from  Michigan was exactly right. And he  ticked off, he read off the tax increases  that will happen under the Democrats  budget plan. And it is important we  not go there.  I always come back to, you know, the  very first thing we did in this Congress,  the majority party,  the Democratic  Party  enacted  some PAYGO  rules,  which  sound great. But what  those  PAYGO rules did was make it easier to  raise taxes.  The last thing this Congress did before we went home for Easter break to  see our constituents and visit our districts, the last thing we did before we  went home for the Easter break was  raise taxes. So they started off the  Congress by making it easier to raise  taxes. The last thing we did before we  went home for break was raise taxes.  And so that should tell you what is at  stake here and why  it  is  important  that we fight for the American families,  like  the gentleman  from California has been doing, and it has been  a pleasure to serve along with him in  that regard. And I will yield back some  time and we can discuss some of this  maybe as we move along.  ANNOUNCEMENTBYTHESPEAKERPROTEMPORE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (",2007

But I will  guarantee my colleagues that there are  several areas in which I would welcome  advice. Over the last several weeks, I  have met with a dozen, two dozen environmental groups, utilities, Tennessee  citizens, others who had suggestions.  For example, the discussion points that  I have put into the record contain five  points that are arguable. I have come  to a  tentative conclusion on  them.  That is in the bill. But there is another  side to the point. I am looking for advice.  For example, should we cap only carbon or all greenhouse gases emitted  from electricity plants? I chose to cap  CO2only. That is because this is a four-  pollutant bill—sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, and carbon. It is not primarily a  climate change bill.

239,,110,-0.519,201,2007-04-19,Mr. TOWNS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to commemorate Yom HaShoah, Holocaust  Remembrance Day. I join the Jewish communities of my district  in Brooklyn,  the entire  American Jewish community, and the State of  Israel in recognizing this barbaric chapter of  world history.  Over 60 years ago, the Nazi regime in Germany began  the wholesale slaughter of  the  European Jewry. This occurred with little public outrage in the United States and the international community. The world, as well  the  American government under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, refused to act to save  European Jewry and that silence undoubtedly  contributed to the death of six million Jews, a  million of whom were children.  When we hear the number six million, we  shudder. The enormity of that number is paralyzing. Merely  trying  to count  to six million  would take months. Imagining the Nazi death  machine executing so many human beings is  daunting. Particularly for those of us who have  not survived the Holocaust, absorbing the reality of that destruction from survivors is so essential to passing on the history of the Holocaust.  The moving museums and heart wrenching  memorials dedicated to the Holocaust across  the United States are vital in educating today’s  youth about the horrors of the Holocaust, and  I want  to  commend all organizations and  groups  that are committed  to  this  important  work.  It  is additionally critical  that European  countries preserve the glaring remnants of the  Holocaust that still exist today. Whether they  are death camps, mass gravesites, cemeteries, synagogues or other holy sites  from  pre-Holocaust Europe, European governments  have an obligation to preserve those sites for  future generations. Sadly, numerous European  countries including Lithuania, Ukraine and Romania have on occasion shirked their responsibilities in this regard.  While we remember the absolute devastation  the Holocaust wrought on  the Jewish  community, we also mark  the  strength of  those who heroically resisted the Nazis including those who fought in the Warsaw Ghetto  Uprising and at  the Sobibor extermination  camp.  I am privileged  to  represent a  large but  dwindling population of Holocaust survivors in  my district. Many of  these survivors  rebuilt  their lives with nothing more than the shirt on  their back. Today, based on the strong foundations  of  those Holocaust  survivors,  the  beautiful Jewish communities of Williamsburg,  Midwood and Canarsie have flourished. These  communities represent the best of Jewish life  and have been instrumental in resurrecting religious life in the aftermath of the Holocaust by  creating synagogues, yeshivas, and other religious institutions.  Madam Speaker,  I would  like  to  take  this  opportunity to recognize the efforts of organizations that have taken extraordinary steps in  servicing and caring for the Holocaust survivor  population  in my district: The Metropolitan  Council on Jewish Poverty; The United Jewish  Organizations of Williamsburg; The Council of  Jewish Organizations of Flatbush; The Jewish  Community Council of Canarsie; The Conference of Jewish Material Claims Against  Germany; Peasch Tikvah and all  the Bikkur  Cholim organizations. Their selfless work for  Holocaust survivors continues to serve as an  inspiration to me and I am honored to recognize their hard work.  Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues here  today in remembering the Holocaust. Though  there are still Holocaust deniers today, it is imperative that we never forget.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE TUCKER HIGH  SCHOOL BOYS BASKETBALL TEAM  HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR.

These Tenacious Tigers of Tucker have  demonstrated the will to win, the courage to  win, the mechanics of teamwork and the astounding spirit of triumph from a mental and  physical battle.  The 9th day of March, 2007 will go down in  history as the day that our Tucker High School  Boys Basketball  team  became  the AAAA  Champions of Georgia.  The team exhibited great moral character on  and off the basketball court through the halls  of Tucker High.  I was pleased to set aside March 31, 2007,  to  honor  and  recognize  the Tucker High  School Basketball Team for its victory for our  District.  f  TRIBUTE TO MARK D.

241,,110,0.402,208,2007-04-19,Mrs. DRAKE.," Mr. Speaker, this has been a  very somber week for the Commonwealth of  Virginia as we have watched  tragedy unfold  on one of our proud universities.  As Virginia’s largest University, the Virginia  Tech family extends into every corner of our  Commonwealth and we have all been affected  by Monday’s events.  Unfortunately, we are not able  to explain  such unthinkable tragedies. Furthermore, mere  words seem small under the weight of such a  heartbreaking event. However,  I express my  deepest sympathy  for  the victims and  their  families and I offer a prayer of support and  condolence for the Virginia Tech community.  As Virginia, and  indeed  the entire Nation,  grieves so many young lives being lost, it is  important  to  remember  the grace,  love and  goodness exhibited by those who survived this  horrible tragedy.  I was  inspired by  the ability of students,  alumni, faculty, family and neighbors to come  together driven by a sense of community and  compassion to support others in their time of  need.  As I took part in yesterday’s convocation at  Cassell Coliseum,  I was encouraged by  the  leadership demonstrated by Gov. Tim Kaine,  President George W. Bush and the numerous  dedicated educators at Virginia Tech.  The coming days, weeks, and months will  continue  to be difficult ones as  the Virginia  Tech community comes  to  terms with what  took place on a dark day in April. But it will  also be a time of healing and I am confident  that Hokie nation will be able to come back  stronger because of the compassion and character that has been displayed since this tragedy.  Just as the heinous actions of one troubled  individual so obviously filled with hate has left  us grasping for answers, the reaction of the  Virginia Tech family gave reason to make all  Virginians proud and demonstrate the tremendous promise of our future generation.  f  COMMEMORATING HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY AND REFLECTING  UPON  THE  GENOCIDE  IN  DARFUR  HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 19, 2007  Ms. WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ.  Madam  Speaker, last Sunday marked Holocaust Remembrance Day, which honors the memory of  the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust  during World War II. We are now in the midst  of the Days of Remembrance established by  the United States Congress as our Nation’s  commemoration of these victims. We remember the Holocaust so that the lessons and responsibilities left from this tragedy are not lost.  Always, but especially now, it is imperative  that we remember and take action against the  genocide  that  is  currently  taking place  in  Darfur. As we look to the past to remember  those that perished at the hand of Nazi Germany, we must  not  forget  the  2,500,000  Darfurian civilians targeted and displaced because of their ethnic or racial identity or the  more  than 300,000 people killed  thus  far.  Tragically, over 1,600 villages have been destroyed by Sudanese government soldiers and  government-backed militias. The growing number of destroyed homes and lives is a testament to the fact that simply remembering is  not enough.  Madam Speaker, as you know, children are  among the most helpless victims of any genocide. One million of the six million Jews that  were killed  in  the Holocaust were children.  Jewish children were targeted by the Nazi regime, and now the children of Darfur suffer the  brutal effects that burning villages, shootings,  rapes, and the search for refuge have on the  youngest victims of this tragedy.  My heart is warmed by the work of grassroots  organizations  in South  Florida  and  across the country that bring attention to the  crisis in Darfur. We must heed the lessons of  Holocaust Remembrance Day and make sure  that another Holocaust never happens again.  Racially  inspired hatred has surfaced many  times in the decades since the Holocaust, and  it is our duty to stop the disaster in Darfur and  make it the last genocide of the 21st century.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE TAX EXEMPT QUALIFICATION FOR FEDERALLY  GUARANTEED WATER,  WASTEWATER, AND OTHER ESSENTIAL COMMUNITY FACILITY  LOANS  HON. RON LEWIS  OFKENTUCKY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 19, 2007  ",2007
242,,110,0.418,208,2007-04-19,Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky.," Madam Speaker, I  rise  to  inform my colleagues of  legislation  I  have introduced today to assist some of our  Nation’s most underserved  communities  in  funding essential infrastructure.  The legislation that I have proposed will permit  interest on  federally guaranteed water,  wastewater, and other essential community facility loans to also qualify to be tax exempt. I  introduced similar legislation in the 109th Congresses.  Rural communities throughout America continue  to  face challenges  in accessing basic  needs. We can improve this situation by supporting  the development of necessary  infrastructure  such  as  dependable water  and  wastewater systems, and essential community  facilities like schools, hospitals, and police and  fire stations.  Unfortunately, many of these same communities struggle to acquire sufficient funding to  support local development projects. Increased  access  to  federally guaranteed  tax exempt  loans would provide significant assistance in  these efforts.  I believe the incentives offered in this bill will  allow small and rural communities better opportunities  to  receive  increased credit  to  finance community facility projects.  I urge my colleagues to consider supporting  this bill.  f  IN HONOR AND  IN MEMORY OF  STAFF  SERGEANT  HARRISON  BROWN OF PRICHARD, ALABAMA  HON.

243,,110,-0.386,215,2007-04-19,Mrs. MALONEY of New York.," Madam  Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the 23rd Street  Association, Inc., of New York City, its President, Sharon L. Ullman, and its honoree Joseph Roberto on  the occasion of  its annual  Distinguished Citizen Award Luncheon. This  year, the Association is bestowing its Distinguished Citizen Award upon Mr. Joseph Roberto, Divisional Senior Vice President  of  North Fork Bank, for his outstanding service to  the community.  The 23rd Street Association was formed in  1929 by 22 local business leaders to improve  environmental conditions and promote economic development in Manhattan. Since that  time, the 23rd Street Association and its civic-  minded members have devoted themselves to  maintaining and improving the quality of life for  both businesses and residents of the vital and  thriving area of Lower Manhattan between  18th and 28th Streets. Today, the Association  plays an active role in the development and  growth of the 23rd Street area, including the  Gramercy Park and Flatiron neighborhoods  and the Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper  Village middle-income housing developments.  The Association also addresses a broad  range of citizen complaints and concerns by  working closely with local community boards  as well as city, state and federal government  agencies. Whether forming a partnership with  the New York City Department of Transportation to ameliorate traffic congestion in Lower  Manhattan or purchasing and planting hundreds of  trees  in conjunction with  the City  Parks Department, the Association’s commitment  to  improving  the neighborhoods and  communities it serves has been truly remarkable. In recent years, the 23rd Street Association worked  to block a plant  to substitute a  nearby women’s shelter with a facility for high-  risk men, a proposal forcefully fought by many  local businesses and residents.  This year,  the 23rd Street Association  is  honoring Mr. Joseph Roberto of North Fork  Bank with its Distinguished Citizen Award. A  veteran of New York’s business community,  Joseph Roberto began his career by working  in his family business, a chain of retail stores  known as Pzaz, from 1979 through 1998. In  1998, Mr. Roberto  joined North Fork Bank,  where he currently serves as  the Divisional  Senior Vice President  for Manhattan. Overseeing the bank’s 45 Manhattan locations, Mr.  Roberto has still found time and boundless energy to devote to his community and to countless worthy causes ranging from the American  Cancer Society  to United Cerebral Palsy  to  the Special Olympics.  The  23rd Street Association’s  president,  Sharon L. Ullman, has compiled an exceptional record of service to the community. She  spearheaded  the establishment of  the new  Flatiron/23rd Street Partnership Business Improvement District, working  tirelessly  for 5  years planning the project, raising the funding  needed to bring it to fruition, and inspiring the  will and energy to make it such an outstanding  success  for  local businesses and  residents  alike. She has also dedicated herself to the  community by serving as the Warden of Madison Square Park and as a  longtime board  member of worthwhile organizations  like  the  Associated Blind,  Inc. Ms. Ullman was also  named one of  the  top 100 New Yorkers by  New York Resident magazine.  Madam Speaker,  I  request  that my colleagues join me in paying tribute to the 23rd  Street Association, its president, Sharon L. Ullman, and  its honoree, Joseph Roberto,  for  their outstanding service and dedication to the  civic life of our nation’s greatest metropolis.  f  THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE  SECURITY OVERSIGHT ACT  HON. EDWARD J. MARKEY  OFMASSACHUSETTS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 19, 2007  ",2007
244,,110,-0.502,215,2007-04-19,Mr. MARKEY.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to introduce the Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act.  The nexus between global warming and the  national security of the United States is a crucial, yet long-ignored, issue. The adverse consequences  of  rising  global  temperatures  present not only a potential environmental catastrophe but a national security emergency.  The security-related consequences of global  warming will range from hampering U.S. military operations  to worsening  the scarcity of  essential  resources  in already unstable  regions—which can lead to the failed states that  are a central breeding ground  for  terrorism,  But because the U.S. intelligence community  has never analyzed  the potential  for global  warming to harm our national security, we lack  a  thorough  understanding  of what  these  threats are. This means that the Department  of Defense and other security agencies cannot  comprehensively plan  for  the security consequences of global warming  the way  that  they plan for countless other serious contingencies.  Today, I am introducing the ‘‘Global Climate  Change Security Oversight Act.’’ This bill  is  cosponsored by the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. BARTLETT)  the  gentleman  from Connecticut, Mr. LARSON, the gentlelady from California, Ms. ESHOO, the gentlelady from California, Ms. SOLIS,  the gentlelady  from New  York, Mr. HALL,  the gentleman  from Washington, Mr. MCDERMOTT, and  the gentleman  from Massachusetts, ",2007
245,,110,-0.577,215,2007-04-19,Mr. OLVER.," This legislation will jump-start U.S. defense planning for  the security consequences of global warming  by authorizing a National Intelligence Estimate  (NIB)  to assess  the  implications of global  warming to United States security and military  operations. Our bill, the House companion to  legislation already introduced by Senator DURBINand Senator HAGEL, will provide a crucial  planning and risk-assessment tool as the Congress  seeks  innovative  solutions  to global  warming. Developed to assess the most serious threats to the United States, NIBs are the  most authoritative  intelligence  judgments on  national security  issues. This  legislation will  also  fund  research by  the Defense Department into the consequences for U.S. military  operations posed by global warming.  It seems clear that our geopolitical and national security posture will only grow worse if  we do not act forcefully to curb our dangerous  dependence on imported oil and reduce our  emissions of global warming pollution. At the  beginning of February,  the world’s  top scientists, as part of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),  provided a scientific smoking gun that human  activities were unequivocally  responsible  for  global warming. Two weeks ago, their second  report told us what happens when the climatic  bullet hits. The developing world will bear the  brunt of the collateral damage from our historic global warming emissions, but the United  States will experience  its own self-inflicted  wounds, including threats to our national security and military readiness.  The United States must act now to understand the security implications of global warming. The Global Climate Change Security  Oversight Act will allow us to do so.  f  CONGRATULATIONS  TO  MR.

Madam Speaker, to live a long life is indeed desirable and many of us would find it  most  desirable. However,  to  live  a  long,  healthy wholesome and productive life is awesome. Such has been the blessed fate of Mr.  Willie Beasley who has been a great husband,  wonderful father, tremendous churchman and  a civic  leader who has understood what  it  should mean to live in a free and democratic  society. For many years, Mr. Beasley was an  outstanding leader at the Carey Certentenary  AME Church, he and his family were anchored  in the community and to this day his children  Ward and Carol continue in his and the family’s tradition.

247,House,110,-0.274,4,2007-05-02,Mr. WALZ of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago today, President Bush  landed for a photo opportunity on an  aircraft carrier in front of a banner  that said ‘‘Mission Accomplished’’ and  declared an end to major combat in  Iraq. Four years later this President  refuses to even discuss the reality of a  military mission that has entered its  fifth year.  Yesterday the President vetoed only  the second bill that has ever come to  his desk. He called it a ‘‘prescription  for chaos and confusion.’’ I ask, how is  that different from what we have now?  He refuses to even hold the Iraqis accountable  for making political, economic or diplomatic reforms that he  promised and they promised to make.  He’s holding up funding for our troops  and for our veterans.  But what exactly  is the President  waiting for? Now that the President  has rejected our legislation, he has the  responsibility  to  tell  the American  people how many more years does he  expect us to stay. Do you think it will  be 5? Maybe 10? And what exactly do  the ground  conditions  look  like  in  order to have us beginning to withdraw? Wishful thinking, political talking points and rigid ideology do not  make good foreign policy.  This President was wrong when he  declared an end of combat operations,  and he has been consistently wrong  about every single thing in Iraq. It’s  time that this President works with  the new Congress, elected by the majority of the American people, so that  we can bring about a change to this  war and truly secure America.  f  STOP THE POLITICAL GAMES  (Ms. FALLIN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2007
248,House,110,0.432,4,2007-05-02,Ms. FALLIN.," Mr. Speaker, this is a  difficult time for our Nation. We are  all war weary. We are all heartbroken  over any loss of life, and we are all concerned about the cost of the war.  All Americans, Republicans, Democrats, and, yes, the President, want  this war over as soon as possible. It’s  time to stop the political games and  put  the needs of our men and our  women defending our Nation first.  The people of America want a solution to bring the troops home, but not  at the expense of jeopardizing the safety and the future of our Nation. As a  Nation, we must make a strong commitment and a declaration to the world  that  the United States will defend  itself and will not tolerate terrorism,  nor will we coddle terrorists or surrender or appease them.  The Commander  in Chief vetoed a  bill which sought to micromanage the  war on terror, tie the hands of our generals, and provide a surrender date to  the enemies. Congress must uphold the  President’s veto, set aside the cut-and-  run attitude, the  loser attitude,  for  good.  Where is the pride for the defense our  Nation, the liberty and the freedoms  that thousands of men and women have  given their lives for in earlier years?  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  MCNULTY). The Chair would  remind  guests in the gallery that any expression of favor or disfavor for what is  said on the floor is a violation of the  rules.  f  THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE  IN  IRAQ AND PRESIDENT BUSH  IS  NOT WILLING TO TAKE THE WAR  IN A NEW DIRECTION  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2007
249,House,110,0.402,4,2007-05-02,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker, under  current law, military pay rates must  be reasonably comparable to those in  the private sector with similar skills,  education, and experience.  Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints over the years, the military  pay increase has not always met this  criteria and a ‘‘pay gap’’ was created.  This gap is not only unfair to our brave  men and women in uniform. It also has  raised  retention  and  readiness  concerns.  For this reason, I have introduced  H.R. 2027, the Military Pay Improvement Act, which would give them a  minimum 3.5 percent pay raise.  Our Nation’s brave men and women  in uniform have fought gallantly to ensure  the continued  safety,  security,  and prosperity of this great Nation. I  believe it is unacceptable that we task  these men and women with extraordinary responsibilities especially, during wartime, and cannot compensate  them accordingly. The debt we owe  them for their sacrifices can never be  repaid. However, my bill will take a  small step  in the right direction to  show our appreciation for their valor.  I urge all my colleagues to cosponsor  the bill.  f  COMMUNICATION FROM HON. JOHN  A.

251,House,110,-0.402,25,2007-05-02,Mr. DOGGETT.,"  I  thank  the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, I believe our Republican colleagues are correct. This Congress spoke with one voice on the war  on terrorism, and we continue to do so.  Indeed, if President Bush had pursued  the war on terrorism and the perpetrators of 9/11, instead of getting diverted  to Iraq, which had nothing to do with  9/11, then when he hoisted that ‘‘Mission Accomplished’’ banner four years  ago, it would have had meaning.  Instead, we have a burn rate of $10  billion every month in Iraq, $14 million  every hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a  week, every week, every month of the  year. More importantly, the real burn  rate is in the loss of more than 3,300  American lives, brave men and women  over there fighting for our country; 96  percent of those deaths, almost all of  them,  lost their  life after President  Bush  declared  ‘‘Mission  Accomplished.’’  Today, the President can veto our attempt to secure a safe, orderly, phased  redeployment of our troops from Iraq,  but he can’t veto reality. Our troops  are coming home. It’s just a question  of what price  is paid  in blood and  money before that happens.  The President talks about listening  to the commanders and the generals. I  wonder if he was listening to General  William Odom, the former National Security Agency Director, last Saturday  when he said the President has let the  Iraq war proceed on ‘‘automatic pilot,  making no corrections in the face of  accumulating evidence that his strategy cannot be rescued.’’  If the President had listened to the  generals, we would never have gone  into Iraq in the first place. It was General Schwarzkopf who said, we would  become ‘‘like [a] dinosaur in a tar pit.’’  If he had listened to the generals like  General Shinseki, if he had insisted on  going into Iraq, he would have sent  enough troops to get the job done and  not  turned  over  all  those weapons  dumps to be converted into IEDs.  If he had listened to the generals, he  would have provided our veterans with  the health care that they have earned  and  deserved  instead  of  subjecting  them back here to the facilities and  care they found in the United States.  The generals who disagree with this  President earn a new title: Retired.  ",2007
252,House,110,-0.297,25,2007-05-02,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker,  by  vetoing this bill, the President refuses  to sustain the troops that we have sent  to Iraq. Every dollar they need, every  ounce of protection they need, and the  health care they need when they come  home is in this bill that he has vetoed.  We refuse to sustain a failed, endless  policy that takes us nowhere.  The President refuses to acknowledge  the reality that we have sent our sons  and  daughters  to  be  referees  in  a  bloody civil war. We acknowledge that  reality, and we want to stop it.  The President refuses to acknowledge  the  comments of General Petraeus,  who says that ending this civil war is a  political mission, not a military one.  We acknowledge that reality, and we  provide the tools to achieve success in  that political mission.  Today the President has refused to  acknowledge the will of the American  people, but we are expressing the will  of the American people.  We will vote to override this veto,  and the result will obtain. But we will  never yield, never quit, never back up  in this effort to change this failing policy and bring our troops home from  Iraq.  Vote to override this veto.  ",2007
253,House,110,0.54,25,2007-05-02,Mr. KINGSTON.,"  I thank the gentleman from California.  Mr. Speaker, I think that we have to  sustain this veto today. I think it’s the  right thing to do, because I think we  need to go back to the drawing board  on this. Number one, the President  does have the constitutionally defined  duty to fight wars, to direct the militia, particularly in a time of war, and  I think that we are getting into a position where we have a lot of folks on  Capitol Hill, perhaps as high as 535 of  us, who think we can run the war more  than the Commander in Chief.  I think we have to recognize that  constitutionally the President has to  do that. I think the President really  has to veto this bill. It’s as much for  the preservation of the office as it is  for his own personal views today.  I think, secondly, while the benchmarks  themselves make  sense,  and  there is a lot of bipartisan agreement  on the benchmarks, there is also great  division as to can these benchmarks be  achieved by the dates outlined in the  bill.

254,House,110,0.229,32,2007-05-02,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the distinguished ranking member of  the subcommittee for his kind words  and for yielding. I also obviously thank  Mr. MILLERand Mr. KILDEE for their  work on this, and Ms. WOOLSEY, who  has worked on it before with me. And I  am pleased to be able to be here.  I support the  legislation before us  today which will reauthorize the Head  Start program. And like almost every  other Member of this body, I believe  strongly in the benefits of this program. I trust that H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act, will improve  Head Start by emphasizing that every  child, regardless of their economic status, should have the best chance possible to succeed.  In 1965, Head Start was created to  give economically disadvantaged children access to the same educational,  health, nutritional, social and other  services that were enjoyed by their  more affluent peers. The goal of the  program was, as it remains today, to  provide  children  a  solid  foundation  that will prepare them for success in  school and later in life.  As the centerpiece of the Federal  Government’s efforts to support quality early childhood education for our  Nation’s most  disadvantaged youth,  Head Start has served nearly 20 million  low-income children and their families.  Currently  Head  Start  serves  over  900,000 children every day and has over  1,600 grantees across the United States.  In my home State of Delaware, Head  Start programs serve over 2,000 children, with over 800 additional 3- and 4-  year-olds receiving assistance through  State government funding.  We all can agree on the need for Head  Start and its successes. We must also  recognize that Head Start can produce  even greater results for children. Students who attend Head Start programs  do start school more prepared than  those with similar backgrounds who do  not attend Head Start. However, Head  Start students continue to enter kindergarten well below national norms of  school readiness. By moving to close  the school readiness gap, this bill will  improve results for almost a million  Head Start students across the Nation.  Toward the goal of closing the readiness gap, the Improving Head Start Act  strengthens  Head  Start’s  academic  focus  while maintaining  its  comprehensive nature that is imperative to  its success. The bill improves the academic focus of the program by establishing new quality standards that ensure  enrolled  children  develop  and  demonstrate  language  skills;  prereading knowledge, including an interest  in and appreciation of books,  reading and writing; premathematics  knowledge, such as recognition of numbers and counting; cognitive abilities  related to academic achievement; and  social development important for environments constructive for child development, early learning and school success.  Research consistently demonstrates  a link between the learning potential  of children and the level of education  and training of classroom teachers. For  that reason, we improve the quality of  teachers in Head Start classrooms by  requiring that in time 50 percent of all  Head Start teachers nationwide must  have a baccalaureate degree.  b1500  As I am sure some of my colleagues  know, this bill does not include a proposed  State  demonstration  project,  which was incorporated into the legislation the House passed in 2003. I believe strongly, however, in the policy  goals of increased coordination and integration that were and continue to be  at the heart of efforts to remove barriers  and  prevent  collaboration  between Head Start and successful State  and local early childhood initiatives.

255,House,110,-0.631,39,2007-05-02,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  strong support of the Improving Head Start Act  of 2007 (H.R. 1429).  Since 1965, Head Start has served millions  of  low-income  families and helped children  prepare for school. It is an essential program  and one whose success has a major impact  on children,  their  families,  their community,  and ultimately the future of our country. We  owe  it  to our children  to pass  this bill and  make improvements that strengthen and grow  the Head Start program.  Scientific research shows us that 80 percent  of brain development occurs by age 3 and 90  percent by age 5. Studies also show that education achievement gaps between poor and  minority students and affluent and non-minority students are already in place when children  begin elementary school. These achievement  gaps, once in place, tend to persist and are  exceedingly difficult to remedy. Head Start and  Early Head Start  are  effective  in  closing  achievement gaps and foster both short and  long-term success in participating children.  In addition to preparing children for success  in  school,  recent  research  clearly  demonstrates that children enrolled in Early Head  Start and their parents realize other very significant gains. Early Head Start children show  better approaches  to  learning, demonstrate  more appropriate  language acquisition, and  exhibit less aggressive behavior. Early Head  Start parents create a stronger home environment with more parent-child  reading and a  greater repertoire of discipline strategies. Early  Head Start  parents  also  show  significant  progress  toward  economic  self-sufficiency.  These  impacts are significant and  result  in  children with increased linguistic, cognitive, social and emotional competence. What better  investment could we be making for our children?  Unlike programs dreamed up by ideologues  in  the Bush Administration  like  ‘‘abstinence  only education’’ and ‘‘marriage promotion,’’ we  know  that Head Start works. Unfortunately,  less than half of eligible children are enrolled  in Head Start. Even worse, less than 5 percent of eligible  infants and  toddlers are enrolled in Early Head Start.  If we are serious about providing all children  with an opportunity to succeed in school and  in life, we must expand Head Start and particularly Early Head Start. This bill is a step in  that direction.  It will more  than double  the  amount of money available  to Early Head  Start programs. The bill will also expand services to infants and toddlers that are so crucial  to child development, but often difficult for parents  to access.  In addition,  the  Improving  Head Start Act will increase eligibility levels so  that children from families making up to 130  percent of the Federal poverty level can participate. This change is especially important in  areas of the country with high costs of living,  including my district where the poverty threshold is well below what it actually costs a family  to live.  This bill’s expansion of Early Head Start and  Head Start should be applauded. We cannot  lose sight, however, that these programs only  address the tip of the iceberg. This Congress  must focus more of our attention on all children birth to age 5 and guarantee that all families have access to high quality comprehensive early care and education programs. This  is an investment that our country must make  if we are serious about giving all of our children a chance at the American dream.  Despite the strong bipartisan support for this  legislation, the White House has indicated that  the President does not support this legislation  as written unless we insert a special interest  provision for the religious right. The President  and many Republicans want to allow religious  organizations  to discriminate  in  their hiring  practices. Religious organizations have been  Head Start providers since the program was  established and have done quite well playing  by the same rules that prohibit all employers  from discriminating. Pandering  rhetoric and  veiled threats from the White House will not  improve the life of a single family.  In closing, I hope that all of my colleagues  will see the importance of investing in our children and supporting families. I urge a ‘‘yes’’  vote on this legislation and a ‘‘no’’ vote on Republican attempts to turn this into a vehicle for  religious discrimination.  ",2007
256,House,110,-0.37,39,2007-05-02,Mr. WU.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation.  Head Start has proven its ability to improve  the lives of disadvantaged children. Numerous  studies have demonstrated that children who  attend Head Start come to school more prepared  than children who do not participate,  and  that  these effects  last over a period of  years.  I have personal experience with  the program—my wife, Michelle, was a Head Start  teacher for 7 years in Oregon. In her classes,  I saw  the children of  janitors and security  guards.  Their parents worked in the sparkling towers  of downtown Portland, but  they  themselves  never got  to visit downtown, except  in  their  Head Start field trips.  The Improving Head Start Act makes several needed changes to current law. It ends  the use of the National Reporting System—a  flawed  testing system  that has  tested over  500,000 4-year-olds, despite strong opposition  by child development experts.  The bill also improves current law by making clear that Head Start agencies must establish and maintain a formal structure of shared  governance with parent policy councils. This  will codify in law that parents have the ability  to shape and share a role in the success of  their local Head Start program.

259,House,110,-0.167,74,2007-05-02,Mr. SPACE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support  of  the  Space-Hare-Welch-Altmire  amendment to H.R. 1429.  Mr. Chairman, I believe that Head  Start is critical for our Nation’s working families. We are a Nation founded  on equality and opportunity for all. All  of our Nation’s children deserve the opportunity to participate in early childhood development programs regardless  as to the financial standing of their  families.  Head Start programs in rural areas  face many unique challenges in delivering services. The January 2007 report  from the National Advisory Committee  on Rural Health and Human Services  confirms the unfortunate reality that  rural Head Start  programs  are,  in  many ways, disadvantaged.  Simply put, in rural and geographically  isolated areas the distance between Head Start providers and participants is a significant mountain to  climb. Especially as gas prices continue  to  stretch both program and  household budgets, the cost of transportation can be prohibitive. These distances can also impede Head Start programs from reaching out to families eligible to participate. It is certainly a  tragedy when families can’t enjoy the  opportunities offered by Head Start  programs because  they didn’t know  about them, not because they weren’t  there.  I am particularly concerned about  barriers to parental involvement. I believe that parental  involvement  fostered by Head Start programs is incredibly important. There is no responsibility of our society more sacred or  profound  than  raising our  children.  Bringing parents together to share in  this experience strengthens our communities,  creating  bonds  that  can  bring them closer together.  In rural areas, parental involvement  is again a challenge. The realities of  less advantaged areas can keep parents  away from these programs. This is simply a missed opportunity to build our  communities.  I believe that H.R. 1429 offers significant improvements to rural Head Start  programs, and I applaud the work of  my colleagues on the Committee on  Education and Labor for making assistance to these areas a priority.  In particular, I wish to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. HARE) for his  amendment in committee that draws  attention to the challenges of teacher  retention and the recruitment of new  participants  in  our Nation’s  rural  areas.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2007
260,House,110,-0.452,81,2007-05-02,Mr. CLEAVER.," Mr. Speaker, I have  been  the  pastor  of  the St. James  United Methodist Church for 33 years.  The bishop gives me the authority to  bring pastors onto our staff, and I discriminate. I have five pastors. All of  them are Methodists, and they are paid  with Methodist dollars. Each one of  them. They are paid out of the stewardship of the church, and I have the  right to do that. But I don’t have the  right to accept Federal dollars and discriminate.  Minorities have come to Washington  over the years because this was the  seat of power and it was believed that  if you could get close to the seat of  power, freedom would be more available. The same thing holds true with  dollars. People go to work for the Federal Government, and if they see dollars going to a Head Start program,  they believe automatically that there  will  be no  discrimination. And we  should not, we  should not,  turn  it  around now.  ",2007
261,House,110,-0.451,81,2007-05-02,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker,  a few weeks ago, Don Imus provoked a  national discussion about  race, but  that was just talk. If we pass this motion, we will take action and turn the  clock back before 1965.  This amendment doesn’t allow faith-  based programs  to get  funded. The  Shuler amendment that we passed reminds us  that  faith-based organizations can and do sponsor Head Start  programs.  The fact is that any program that  can be funded under this amendment  could be funded anyway if they would  agree not to discriminate in employment. It has nothing to do with symbols. It is absurd to suggest that this  has  anything  to  do with  symbols.  Whatever problem there is with symbols is a constitutional problem that  cannot be solved with a motion to recommit.  This is all about discrimination. And  if you can discriminate based on religion,  it has  racial  implications. So  since the 1960s, for 40 years, when you  talk about civil liberties, you are talking about the victims of discrimination. We decided 40 years ago that it  was so reprehensible to discriminate in  employment that we made it illegal,  even with your own private money.  And today, as we talk about discrimination, we ought to think about the  victims, not the right of the person to  discriminate against the victim.  The present law allows the church to  use its own church money, as the gentleman  from Missouri  said,  to hire  whom they want. But with Federal  money, just with the Federal money,  you have not been able to discriminate.  So for 40 years, all children in Head  Start programs have learned that their  parents are eligible to be hired by the  Head Start program regardless of the  race or religion of the program. They  have known that for over 40 years. This  amendment will determine what the  next generation of Head Start students  will learn.  We need to defeat this amendment.  ",2007

265,House,110,0.855,102,2007-05-02,Mr. FLAKE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  First, let me point out I have the utmost respect for my friend from Washington. We have worked together on  many issues. First, he mentioned that  the private sector groups are in support of this  legislation and the National Science Foundation. I have no  doubt. It doesn’t surprise me at all.  But I would submit that that’s akin to  the government saying we are in a position now to fund free lunches for everyone out there, and you can do it on  the government’s dime.  I would say that virtually every company in America would say that’s a  great idea. Now we don’t have to fund  that. We don’t have to subsidize it for  our employees. We can keep the profits, invest them elsewhere. If private  companies don’t have to expend that  money  in  their R&D budgets,  they  would like not to. But that was a point  I made,  that  this  often  supplants  money that would be invested in the  private  sector,  probably more  efficiently if overall government spending  is any guide.  To the amendment in specific, the  gentleman from Georgia said it well.  With all the high-priority items in the  National Science Foundation budget,  to take money out of that and to give  it to those who didn’t present a successful proposal would seem to me not  the highest-priority use of money.  Remember, this is a new program. I  am not cutting a program that exists.  This is a new pilot project. I just don’t  think this is a road that we want to go  down. I started to mention, before my  time ran out before, we have seen this  in other fields, in other earmark fields,  where people are funding business consortiums. Many of the earmarks in this  body go to business consortiums to  help them draft grant proposals to get  other earmarks or to get grants from  government or to  lobby to get earmarks. It’s simply not a road that we  want to go down as a Congress, I would  submit.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",2007

Nicole was known to many as a person who  possessed the heart of a servant. She found  ways to invest in those around her, whether it  was through conversation, friendship, lending  a helping hand, or through volunteer work. As  a trained emergency medical technician, she  is believed to have even been helping people  in the final moments of her life. Those who  were close to her know how passionately Nicole gave back to her community, classmates,  teachers, and  family. She was a committed  member of her church’s outreach program, a  Sunday school teacher, an EMT for the Smithfield Volunteer Fire and Rescue Squad, and a  lifeguard at her local YMCA.  Many say that one of Nicole’s greatest loves  in life was taking care of animals. During high  school, Nicole volunteered at local stables and  barns to take care of horses. In this hobby, it  is clear to see that Nicole’s heart and mission  in life was to serve and care for others. Nicole  was a double-major in International Relations  and German at Virginia Tech.  Nicole was a person who loved life, loved  serving people,  loved her  family, and, most  importantly, loved the Lord. Although her life  was tragically cut short, many are blessed to  have known and loved her.  f  RECOGNIZING THE FIRST MAJORITY WOMEN  CITY  COUNCIL  IN  KANSAS  CITY, MISSOURI  HISTORY  HON.

271,,110,-0.452,214,2007-05-02,Mr. CLEAVER.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to congratulate and recognize history in  the making. Today, for the first time in Kansas  City, Missouri’s history, a majority women’s  City Council will be sworn  in at City Hall.  While I wish I could have joined them in person in the Council Chambers I used to serve  in as Mayor of Kansas City, I want to honor  today’s  incoming Mayor, Mark Funkhouser,  and the talented twelve City Council members  who represent our State’s largest city. Among  them, seven women who are making history;  by proving that our society can deliver change  when  the people call  for  it. These extraordinary women have demonstrated that the social norms by which women have traditionally  been confined can be eradicated and  the  prospect for real change is not only plausible,  but possible.  The women that stand before the City Clerk  today and take the oath of office as members  of the first majority women City Council are:  Deb Hermann—serving  the  1st District-at-  Large, Melba Curls—serving the 3rd District-  at-Large, Sharon Sanders Brooks—serving the  3rd District, Beth Gottstein—serving  the 4th  District-at-Large, Jan Marcason—serving  the  4th District, Cindy Baker Circo—serving  the  5th District-at-Large, and Cathy Jolly—serving  the 6th District-at-Large.  Deb Hermann was first elected to the City  Council in March 2003 and was immediately  appointed Chairwoman of  the Neighborhood  and Housing Committee and member of the  Operations Committee. She brought with her  experience and leadership ability through active participation and  involvement  in nearly  thirty civic and community organizations since  1979. She was a member of  the Gracemor  Randolph Community Council  for 24 years  and served as  its President  from 1994 until  her election to the City Council. Councilwoman  Hermann served as the Chairwoman for the  Property Maintenance Advisory Committee in  2001, and in 1999 was appointed as a Kansas  City Plan Commission Board Member. Councilwoman Hermann has proudly served  the  citizens of the 1st District-at-Large for the past  four years and continues to place a high priority on her commitment to neighborhoods.  Melba J. Curls has served the 41st District  in  the Missouri House of Representatives  since 1999, ending her service in 2006 to run  for City Council. While  in office, she championed many causes, the most notable being  legislation  that extended renewal of  the KC  Area Transportation Authority’s taxing ability to  ensure that the critical needs for public transportation  services  remained  funded  in our  community. This helped the less fortunate with  their need for public access to jobs and health  care. Curls has a long history of public service. Prior to her State election, she was employed in the Mayor’s Office with the City of  Kansas City, and before that, she served as a  staff assistant in the Kansas City office of U.S.  Senator Tom Eagleton. Curls  is a  life-long  resident of Kansas City, and attended the University of Missouri-Columbia.  Sanders Brooks has served the 37th District  in  the Missouri House of Representatives  since 2000, ending her service in 2006 to run  for City Council. While in the State Legislature,  she championed many causes, the most notable being a bill  that outlived mandatory set-  asides  for Minority and Women-owned businesses. She has long been committed to protecting our community’s history and brings that  passion to fight for the causes of her constituents with her to City Hall. Prior to her State  election, Brooks was successful civil rights investigator. A long-time friend and parishioner  of mine, Brooks  is a graduate of American  University  in Washington, DC where  she  earned a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism.  Beth Gottstein formerly served as the Resource Development Manager at the Hispanic  Economic Development Corporation  before  stepping  down  to  run  for  City  Council.  Gottstein has also been known to spearhead  several  local candidate campaigns and has  long been active in our region’s political organizations, including assisting with my first election to Congress. Gottstein has prior City Hall  experience and has also been  intimately  involved with the Greater Kansas City Women’s  Political Caucus, a local organization that promotes  women’s  involvement  in  politics.  Gottstein earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political  Science from the University of Missouri and a  Master’s of Public Administration from University of Missouri-Kansas City.  For the past sixteen years, Jan Marcason  has served as the Executive Director of the  Mid-America Assistance Coalition, where she  managed an annual budget of more  than a  million dollars and helped direct millions of  dollars  to  local social service organizations.  She was also  the  former President of  the  Women’s Political Caucus. Previously, Jan’s  public service extended  to Washington, DC,  where she worked for former Vice President  Walter Mondale. Marcason was born and  raised in Kansas City. She earned a Bachelor  of Arts  in Education  from  the University of  Kansas, and a Master’s in Business Administration  from University  of Missouri-Kansas  City.

272,,110,-0.451,221,2007-05-02,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to celebrate the 100th birthday of  Oliver White Hill, who dedicated his life and  legal talents to making the City of Richmond,  the Commonwealth of Virginia, and this entire  country a place of promise and opportunity for  all. Mr. Hill used his legal talents to bravely  confront and help eradicate decades of racial  inequality and injustice.  Oliver White Hill was born Oliver White in  Richmond, Virginia. After his mother  remarried, the Hill family moved to Washington, DC,  where Oliver White Hill graduated  from  the  legendary Dunbar High School. Mr. Hill went  on  to earn his undergraduate degree  from  Howard University, and then attended Howard  University’s Law School, where, as destiny  would have  it, he was a classmate, rival  in  academic achievement, and close  friend of  Thurgood Marshall. Upon graduating in 1933,  second in his class only to the future Supreme  Court Justice, Mr. Hill spent his early years as  a civil rights attorney in Richmond, Virginia.  It was there that Mr. Hill grudgingly worked  within the confines of the separate-but-equal  framework of Plessy  v. Ferguson, but he  fought hard for better pay, full access to transportation, and better educational facilities for  African American  teachers and students.  In  fact,  in 1940, working with civil  rights  legal  stalwarts  Thurgood  Marshall, William  H.  Hastie, and Leon A. Ranson, Mr. Hill won his  first of many  landmark cases  in Alston v.  School Board of Norfolk, Va.  In Alston,  the  Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered equal  pay for black and white teachers within Norfolk’s school system. Despite the decision, Mr.  Hill was not completely satisfied as race barriers remained, and, as he once said, ‘‘I went  to law school so I could go out and fight segregation.’’  That fight would have to wait. Oliver White  Hill  joined  the Army  in 1943 and admirably  served his country in the European Theatre in  World War II. After a distinguished military career, Mr. Hill immediately began to fight for democracy on a different  front—back  in  the  courts against racial discrimination.  Soon after his return, Oliver White Hill won  the  right  for equal  transportation  for Black  school children in the Virginia Supreme Court.  But once again, he was not satisfied with this  ‘‘separate-but-equal’’ victory. The course of  history was about to change, however, as Mr.  Hill partnered with another civil  rights  legal  legend, Spottswood Robinson III, in 1948.  Together, Mr. Hill and Mr. Robinson brought  dozens of civil rights lawsuits against school  districts throughout the State of Virginia, with  as many as seventy-five (75) cases pending at  one time. By some estimates, Mr. Hill and Mr.  Robinson brought more lawsuits than the total  filed  in all  the other Southern States during  this era.  Despite the burning of a cross in his front  yard and despite almost daily threatening telephone calls to his home, Mr. Hill persevered.  In 1951, undeterred and emboldened, Oliver  White Hill and Spottswood Robinson decided  to move beyond ‘‘separate-but-equal’’ and attack segregation head-on.  That year, Mr. Hill and Mr. Robinson shouldered the cause of the African American students at the all-black R.R. Morton High School  in Farmville, VA, who had walked out of their  leaking, poorly heated classroom building. The  resulting  desegregation  lawsuit,  Davis  v.  County School Board of Prince Edward County, was one of several cases decided collectively as Brown v. Board of Education by the  U.S. Supreme Court in 1954.  While Oliver White Hill is best known as the  fierce, tireless civil rights litigator who helped  bring to a close America’s segregation-era, his  involvement  in  the community went beyond  the courtroom. In 1949, he became the first  African American elected to the Richmond City  Council  since Reconstruction.  In  the early  1960s, Mr. Hill served as Federal Housing  Commissioner in the Department of Housing  and Urban Development.  In addition  to his  local and Federal government posts, Mr. Hill  served as an officer or member on the boards  of many organizations, including the National  Legal Committee of the NAACP, the National  Bar Association, the Southern Conference for  Human Welfare, the Virginia State Bar Bench/  Bar Relations Committee, and the Old Dominion Bar Association, which he co-founded.  For his decades of dedication to the law and  accomplishments in the field of civil rights, Oliver White Hill has earned many accolades, including the ‘‘Lawyer of the Year Award’’ from  the National Bar Association  in 1959,  the  ‘‘Simple  Justice Award’’  from  the NAACP  Legal Defense Fund in 1986, and the ‘‘Justice  Thurgood Marshall Award’’ from the American  Bar Association  in 1993.  In 1999, President  Clinton awarded Mr. Hill the highest honor the  nation can bestow, the Presidential Medal of  Freedom. A year  later Mr. Hill received  the  American Bar Association Medal, the National  Bar Association ‘‘Hero of Law Award,’’ and the  ‘‘Harvard Medal of Freedom’’ for his role in the  landmark Brown decision. Most  recently,  in  2005, Mr. Hill was awarded  the NAACP’s  highest honor, the Springarn Medal.  In 2000, several legal admirers founded the  Oliver White Hill Foundation. The Foundation  encourages young lawyers to become advocates in the field of individual rights and liberties and  to carry on Mr. Hill’s civil  rights  work. Lawyers  inspired by  the Foundation  work with the hope that discrimination based  on race, gender, national origin, sexual preference, and  religion will ultimately be abolished, just as Mr. Hill has spent his life hoping  for and working towards.  Madam, Speaker, I offer my congratulations  to Oliver White Hill and pay tribute to him for  being one of history’s most  important civil  rights legal pioneers.  f  CONGRATULATING MR.

273,,110,0.57,221,2007-05-02,Mr. BURGESS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to congratulate Mr. Bill Mullican of Lubbock, Texas on his recent appointment to the  National Advisory Council  for Environmental  Policy and Technology (NACEPT).  Mr. Mullican was appointed to the NACEPT  by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  Administrator, Stephen Johnson, on April 23,  2007. The Council is comprised of outside experts representing diverse interests from academia,  industry, non-governmental organizations, and state, local and tribal governments.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) established  the NACEPT  for  the purpose of providing expert advice  to  the EPA  Administrator on a wide array of environmental  policy,  technology, and management  issues.  Due to his vast knowledge of water development policies and  issues, Mr. Mullican will  prove to be a valuable asset to the NACEPT.

For a  century and a half, San Jose State has provided affordable, quality education. From  its  humble beginnings as a normal school to train  teachers, San Jose State has grown  into a  comprehensive university, offering bachelor’s  and master’s degrees in 134 programs.  The University reflects the ethnic diversity of  California and particularly, that of Santa Clara  County with no single ethnic group comprising  a majority of  the student population. As a  graduate of San Jose State, I am particularly  proud to note that the University ranks tenth  among the Nation’s top public universities in  the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded to  minority students across all disciplines. Additionally, San Jose State University has conferred bachelor’s degrees  in business management and the health professions to more  Asian American and Pacific Islanders than any  other college or university in the Nation.

275,,110,-0.543,235,2007-05-02,Mr. ELLISON.," Madam Speaker,  it  is an  honor for me to speak in support of the Paul  Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity  Act of 2007. I want to thank both Congressman KENNEDYand Congressman RAMSTAD for  their dedication to ending insurance discrimination and ensuring all Americans have access to mental health and addiction services.  I also want to thank Speaker PELOSI, Majority  Leader HOYER, and Majority Whip CLYBURN for  their  leadership  in championing  this bill and  mental health access issues.  As a Minnesotan, I’m struck by the emotion  of  this day because  the  late Senator Wellstone’s tireless efforts to ensure mental health  parity might finally be realized. Paul Wellstone  knew it was wrong for health insurers to place  discriminatory  restrictions on  treatments and  I’m honored to be a part of this effort to finally  guarantee that the millions of Americans who  need mental health and addiction services can  obtain the treatment they deserve.  The urgent need  for  the Paul Wellstone  Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of  2007 is surely best expressed by those who  have seen a loved one in need denied coverage.  I  think  immediately of Kitty Westin,  whose daughter Anna suffered from anorexia,  a deadly disease that affects approximately 8  million  Americans  and  ultimately  claimed  Anna’s life. During her daughter’s battle with  anorexia, Kitty took Anna to the hospital. Anna  was refused care by their insurance company  because it did not consider access to mental  health treatment important enough to cover.  Kitty knows this is completely unacceptable  and has been fighting selflessly to make sure  no other family experiences the same frustration and pain. I commend her for carrying on  Anna’s legacy so impressively through her advocacy efforts and community work. For Kitty  and all of the others who have encountered insurance  discrimination,  I  carry Paul Wellstone’s message that mental health care is an  imperative part of all heath care. My hope is  that this bill in his name will finally pass, guaranteeing  that all Americans have access  to  mental health and addiction services.  f  TRIBUTE  TO  RYAN  JOHN  BURGESS, UNITED STATES MARINE,  LANCE CORPORAL  HON. DAVE CAMP  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 2, 2007  ",2007
276,,110,0.385,235,2007-05-02,Mr. CAMP of Michigan.," Madam Speaker,  the events of  the  last  few years have  reminded us that ‘‘eternal vigilance is the price  of liberty.’’ The United States stands as a beacon of hope and liberty for the world because  of the eternal vigilance of the men and women  who have  served and are  serving  in  the  United States military.  Marine Lance Corporal Ryan John Burgess  was one such soldier. A patriot through and  through, Ryan did not hesitate to answer the  call  to duty when his country went  to war.  Never an easy decision, and one that causes  great concern amongst parents, Ryan enlisted  and excelled as a marine. His leadership was  often recognized by his superiors in the form  of being granted additional responsibilities.  Today, I want to recognize on the floor of  the United States House of Representatives  the life and service of Ryan John Burgess—a  life given in full so that our freedom may be  preserved. Ryan’s bravery serves as a stark  reminder of  the  responsibility we have as  stewards of this great country—the land of the  free and the home of the brave.  So, as we salute heroes  like Ryan John  Burgess, we  remember  them with undying  gratitude. And we resolve, though we cannot  repay the debt we owe them, to live our lives  in such a way as to be worthy of their sacrifice.  May God keep Ryan; may God watch and  comfort his family; and, may God continue to  grant this Nation with the courage to defend  life and liberty.  HONORING THE CAREER OF  STEPHEN MCKENNEY STECK  HON. TOM FEENEY  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 2, 2007  ",2007
277,,110,0.641,235,2007-05-02,Mr. FEENEY.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor Mr. Stephen McKenney Steck for his  40 years of service to the WMFE public broadcasting stations that serve the greater Orlando  area.  An Orlando native, Steve began his only career in 1959 at WFTV (then WLOF) as a television director and later as senior producer/director for news and public affairs programs.  Steve started a 40-year  run at WMFE  in  1967 as production manager and was appointed operations manager in 1970. In 1972,  Steve was elected President of WMFE and  held that position with distinction for 34 years.  Steve’s major accomplishments during his  tenure include moving WMFE’s physical plant  to a multi-million dollar broadcast center  in  East Orlando,  the activation of public  radio  station 90.7 WMFE–FM, expanding both station’s programming to a full 24-hour per day  schedule,  overseeing  a  program  schedule  viewed each week by more than 485,000 Central Florida households and a radio schedule  listened to each week by more than 194,000  Central Florida residents.  Steve concluded a $4 million expansion of  the Public Broadcasting Center in 1992, a $2  million reexpansion in 2003, and a $10 million  Campaign  for Program Excellence  in 2002  generating  funds directed  to  local programming that connected the community in a manner not duplicated by local electronic media.  Steve recently concluded WMFE’s $7 million  Campaign for Digital Television that activated  WMFE–DT/Channel  23  in  2003. He  has  launched  the creation of a new $2.4 million  program vision for these stations. A transition  to digital radio broadcasting rests in the short-  term future. Under his leadership, WMFE’s annual budget has grown from $250,000 to more  than $8 million.  At age 63, Steve attained a 10-year goal:  starting in and finishing a marathon in all of  the 50 states and the District of Columbia and  on  all  7  continents—including  Antarctica!  Steve is married to Desta L. Homer, a former  teacher at Winter Springs High School  in  Seminole County. They have three adult children and five grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, in closing, I would like to  extend my heartfelt  thanks  to Steve  for his  years of service and dedication to his Orlando  community. I ask my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Mr. Steve on his retirement and  wishing him the best of luck in all future endeavors.  f  INTRODUCTION  OF  REPAIRING  YOUNG WOMEN’S LIVES AROUND  THE WORLD ACT  HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 2, 2007  ",2007
278,,110,-0.666,1,2007-05-14,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise to call for an explanation and a  full accounting from the Department of  Defense concerning an attack on Camp  Falcon last year. This much is not in  dispute: Under cover of darkness on October 10, 2006, Camp Falcon, America’s  largest military base in Iraq, which is  10 miles south of Baghdad, was attacked by insurgents, and the base was  shelled with mortars and rockets. An  enemy round struck an ammunition  store which triggered massive explosions and huge fireballs that lit up the  night sky in Baghdad.  News footage and amateur video were  shown on television in the Middle East,  and a BBC reporter described the explosions as immense. In the days following  the attack, U.S. military officers  in  Iraq repeatedly said that the damage  would not degrade U.S. military capacity and that the attack did not injure  or kill anyone at the base.  In a briefing on October  12,  2006,  Major General William Caldwell told  reporters, ‘‘Very fortunately, no coalition forces or Iraqi security forces were  injured, nor civilian casualties  that  anyone is aware of at this point. We  lost some munitions, but took no personnel casualties.’’ That is the official  line for the military.  But the questions are beginning to  surface as to whether the official line  is the truth. It was brought to my attention yesterday during a meeting in  my congressional office with Mohammed al Deeni, an independent member  of the Iraqi Parliament. He came to the  U.S. to talk with Members of Congress  about the realities of life in Iraq. At  my invitation, other Members of Congress joined me in this face-to-face legislative exchange of information. They  heard what I am about to share.  During our meeting, I asked Mr. al  Deeni if Iraq was so unstable that a  terrorist attack could claim a  large  number of Americans in one attack. As  many of us remember, that  is what  happened in 1983 when a massive terrorist truck bomb struck and killed 241  U.S. Marines in Beirut. I wanted to  know if such an attack was possible in  Iraq. Without hesitation, Mr. al Deeni  said such an attack had already occurred. He said—and others are saying  online—that the attack on Camp Falcon killed 300 Americans, wounded another 200 Americans and killed or injured another 200 Iraqis.  The Pentagon says there were no casualties. But a member of the Iraqi Parliament and others claim there were  significant casualties. Which story is  true? Satellite  images, aerial photographs, videos and written accounts  that purport to be  firsthand can be  found online.  I will enter  into  the  RECORDa list of some of these sites so  that people can see for themselves.  Internet sites which contains video, photographs, or written accounts of the attack on  Camp Falcon on October 10, 2006:  http://www.cawa.fr/destruction-du-camp-  americain-falcon-explosions-d-armes-a-l-ua-  et-ou-d-armes-nucleaires-tactiques-  article00913.html.  http://www.dailymotion.com/related/966319/  video/xkpjv_base-falcon-irakexplosion-  nucleaire/1.  http://abutamam.blogspot.com/2006/10/no-  reported-casualties-at-camp-falcon.html.  http://zennobia.blogspot.com/2006/10/al-  rashid-falcon-military-bases.html.  Here is one excerpt from a site written after the attack by French journalists: ‘‘Nine big carriers marked by the  Red Cross sign transporting the dead  and injured were seen by journalists  . . . Silence still wraps the whole event  from the side of the American military  as well as the Bush administration,  since there remains only a few weeks  before the legislative elections, with a  public opinion more and more against  the war.’’  This happened  just before the  last  elections, and it is unclear as to what  happened. I don’t know if these stories  are credible. But these reports cannot  be ignored. If we lost hundreds of U.S.  soldiers and other Americans in one attack, Congress and the American people have a right to know about it.  I looked at the videos and the aerial  photographs, and the damage appears  quite extensive to buildings and military  vehicles  like  tanks.  Perhaps  American soldiers and others miraculously escaped injury. That would be  very good news. Or perhaps we don’t  know what  really happened on  the  night of October 10, 2006 in an insurgent attack on Camp Falcon.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

White Post Office  Building.  Willye B. White was born to run. She  was a five-time Olympic track and field  athlete from Money, Mississippi. She  was the best female long jumper of the  time. She made Chicago her home in  1960 until her untimely death in February, 2007.  She wasn’t a household name, but  she should have been, especially if your  household happens to be one of the millions that includes a female athlete. Or  an athlete of color. Or a once or future  Olympian. She was better known for  her  actions  than her name,  better  known for her deeds than her medals.  At 16, she competed in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games and became the  first American woman to ever medal in  the long jump, earning a silver medal.  She participated in the next four Olympiads as well, and is the first American  to compete on five Olympic track and  field teams. She won another silver  medal in the 1964 Tokyo Games in the  4-by-100-meter relay. Ms. White competed in more than 150 nations as a  member of 39 different  international  track and field teams.  Over the years, White remained active  in the  field of sports. She represented track and field on the U.S.  Olympic Committee, coached athletes  in the National Sports Festival in 1979  and 1981, coached and managed at the  1981 World Cup Track and Field Championship Games in Brussels and Rome,  and served as the head coach for the  1994 Olympic Sports Festival.

Tonight,  I would  like  to  tell  the  story of Christopher Herrera. Lance  Corporal Evenor Christopher Herrera  was just 9 years old when his family  came to the United States from Honduras  in  search of opportunity. He  found that opportunity for himself in  the United States serving in the Marine Corps, which he joined a year after  graduating from Gypsum’s Eagle Valley High School in Colorado.  He  figured that enlisting he could  pave the way to a better future, or, as  he  told his  family,  the  22 year-old  would be considered a hero if he should  die while serving his adopted country.  Fate chose him the latter. On August  10, 2005 while manning a machine gun  during a clash near Ar Ramadi in Iraq,  an  improvised explosive device detonated. Herrera was killed in combat  with a month and a half left before he  was to return home.  From  the  time his  family  immigrated from Honduras, he began talking about  joining  the Army. Christopher, as he was known to his family  and friends, was not naive about the  dangers he faced in Iraq. His brother,  who was also a Marine, said that Christopher was happy to fight for the country that he loved. He would rather die  over there as a hero and be remembered as doing something good, as opposed to being here and not remembered at all.  His mother, Blanca,  said  that he  joined because he wanted to have more  opportunity in this country. He wanted  a career in the Marines. The stories  about Christopher come easily. His sister recalled about how shy he was, but  yet he was fearless, and once drove a 4-  wheel-drive vehicle down a muddy hill,  nearly flipping it over. Christopher enjoyed typical mountain activities like  most young men in Colorado, like fishing and snowboarding.  The brothers often went camping.  The brothers were close, but because  they were both deployed Balmore Herrera  hadn’t  seen  his  brother  in  7  months. When Christopher was killed,  Balmore was called to act as official  military  transport  as  his  brother’s  body was transported from Maryland  to Colorado.  There have been 3,396 servicemembers killed  in Iraq and Afghanistan,  and over  25,000 Americans wounded.  This evening, members of the Hispanic  Caucus  rise  to  recognize  immigrant  servicemembers because  these brave  men and women didn’t have the privilege of being born  in this country.  They chose to live here, and also made  the choice to serve the country they  loved in the Armed Forces.  Many immigrants, like Christopher,  have paid the ultimate sacrifice  for  their country. Each of  them has a  story. Each story is filled with struggle  and a hope for opportunity. Like Christopher, each story is also filled with  sacrifice.

289,,110,-0.419,99,2007-05-14,Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to support  the Student Loan Sunshine Act, and to congratulate Chairman MILLERand Ranking Member MCKEON for moving  quickly on this critical issue.  The recent investigation by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has brought attention to serious problems in our student aid  industry. While it is unfair to malign all schools  and all lenders, it is clear that in large part due  to  lax oversight by  the Department of Education, there have been many instances of actions  intended  for profit—rather  than  for  improving student access to education. It is time  to put an end to the conflicts of interest and  corrupt practices that increase costs for students and taxpayers.  This legislation is an important first step in  improving oversight of the student loan industry and  in ending  inappropriate relationships  between lenders and colleges and universities.  H.R. 890 will ban loan arrangements that include benefits to higher education institutions,  prohibit lenders from serving as staff in campus  financial aid offices, and ban gifts  from  lenders to campus officials and their families.  It allows the continuation of preferred lender  lists but  requires  that  these  lists  include at  least 3 lenders and that the institutions explain  their choices. This bill includes civil penalties  for companies that violate the new regulations  and increases the Department of Education’s  authority to regulate the private loan market.  The Student Loan Sunshine Act also makes it  clear that lenders who are transparent in their  processes and advocate on behalf of students  continue to be an important part of the student  aid system.  Mr. Speaker, the recent scandals in the student loan industry illustrate the Department of  Education’s failure to adequately regulate the  student loan industry and the conflicts of interest too often noted in this administration. As  the New York Times reported, Department officials were alerted  to  inappropriate  lender  subsidies in 2003 and failed to act. This week  a top ED official, who formerly worked for Sallie Mae, has resigned. It has also been noted  that a recently investigated lender was a top  contributor to the Republican party. It is time  to  refocus higher education policy where  it  should be—on the student.  This Congress has made access to higher  education a priority. It is critical to the future  of students, our communities and our Nation.  With more and more students and parents relying on student loans and with student debt  burden increasing, clearly we must do all we  can to ensure the integrity of student aid programs. The Student Loan Sunshine Act is an  important  first step.  I also  look  forward  to  working with Chairman MILLERand the other  members of  the Education and Labor Committee to pass a strong Higher Education Act  Reauthorization  that  protects  students,  increases access to higher education, and improves our Nation’s global competitiveness.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in supporting H.R. 890.  f  RECOGNIZING THE DEDICATION OF  DOCTOR SUSAN A. COTA  HON. ELLEN O.

290,,110,-0.395,99,2007-05-14,Mr. THOMPSON of California.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today to recognize Acme Rigging & Supply Company in Ukiah, California,  on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. Acme  has been locally owned and operated for the  past 50 years, and for the last 18 years has  transitioned  into a wholly employee-owned  business while continuing to expand its operations and the markets it serves.  Acme Rigging started out in 1957 as the vision of Pete Dunnebeck, when  five  rigging  shops went out of business on the northern  California  coast.  Initially, as  the  sole employee, he took orders, performed the assembly, and  then delivered  the  final product  to  customers.  Thirty-two  years  later  Mr.  Dunnebeck was getting ready to phase out of  the business when he  learned about Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP).  In 1989, Mr. Dunnebeck sold forty-nine percent of  the business  to his employees. By  1997,  the employees had  fulfilled  the payoff  on their shares and approached the Savings  Bank of Mendocino County to borrow money  to purchase  the remaining 51 percent. This  was the first loan of its kind for the local bank,  and they put the deal together and agreed on  a ten-year payback. The employees met that  obligation in nine years, one year earlier than  expected.  Upon  the  retirement of Mr. Dunnebeck,  John Peaslee took the reins of the company  and has guided an impressive expansion. In  1997, Acme Rigging had less than three million dollars in sales. By 2006 that number had  tripled. The company grew from eight employees to a total of 29 today. A second location  was opened  in Sacramento  in 2000. Acme  Sacramento started with four employees and  now has 10.  Madam Speaker and colleagues, there are  more than 10,000 ESOP companies employing nine to ten million employee/owners in our  country. Acme Rigging & Supply Company is  a superb example of how well employee stock  ownership plans can work.

293,House,110,-0.178,20,2007-05-21,Mr. MELANCON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am here today with a  resolution with my  friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MARIODIAZ-  BALART), that will help to make America aware of hurricanes and the devastation. This  resolution  supports  the  goals and ideals of National Hurricane  Preparedness Week. It encourages the  staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, especially  at the National Weather Service and  the National Hurricane Center  and  other appropriate Federal agencies, to  continue  their outstanding work  to  educate people  in the United States  about hurricane preparedness.  It also urges the people of the United  States to recognize such a week as an  opportunity to learn more about the  work of the National Hurricane Center  to forecast hurricanes and to educate  citizens about the potential risks associated with hurricanes.  In light of the storms and devastation caused by Katrina and Rita in August and September of 2005, I think it  is appropriate that America be aware  of the situations with hurricanes, particularly since some 53 percent of all  Americans live along the coastal areas  of this country.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr. MARIO DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  gentleman from Louisiana for his help.  Before I discuss this important issue, I  want to thank Chairman GORDONand  Ranking Member HALLand their great  staffs for allowing this important resolution that has been brought here before you to move forward so quickly.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of House Resolution 402, supporting the  goals and ideals of National Hurricane  Preparedness Week as established by  the National Hurricane Center. Hurricane Preparedness Week began yesterday, May 20, and lasts through May 26  of this year.  Next Friday, June 1, marks the beginning of the hurricane season, unfortunately, in the Atlantic and central  Pacific Oceans. Hurricane season lasts  6 months, until November 30, and those  are 6 months that those of us in Florida pay close attention to.  The goal of Hurricane Preparedness  Week is to inform the public about hurricane hazards and to provide knowledge that can be used to take action.  We have to be ready. This information  can be used to save lives and to protect  your home and your property.  History has taught us that a lack of  hurricane awareness and preparation  are common among all major hurricane disasters, but by knowing your  vulnerability and what actions you as  an individual and family can take, you  can reduce the effects of a hurricane  disaster.  One of the biggest  lessons  learned  from the recent wave of hurricanes is  that residents should have enough supplies to survive for at least 3 days after  the landfall of a hurricane. Oftentimes  government and law enforcement personnel are engaged in restoring safety  and calming the situation and trying  to reach people after a landfall of a  hurricane.  Ideally  residents  should  have enough food, water and supplies  to at least last them 3 days until the  authorities can actually get there and  lend a hand.  Millions  of Americans  face  great  risks from tropical storms and hurricanes. More than 50 percent of Americans live along the coast, and millions  of tourists visit the oceans and the  coasts each year.  The statistics associated with hurricanes are frankly staggering. An average of 11 tropical storms develop each  year over the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Six  of those storms will probably become  hurricanes.  The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season  was the busiest on record, including 28  named storms, 15 hurricanes in which 7  were a Category 3 or higher. As a  Coastal State, Floridians are keenly  aware of Mother Nature’s wrath and  fury, especially when it comes to hurricanes.  In just 2 short years, eight hurricanes  have made  landfall  in Florida  from  2004–2005. They were Charlie, Frances,  Ivan, Jeanne, Dennis, Katrina, Wilma  and Rita. We have heard and read and  had to deal with the consequences of  those storms.  As we have learned in the past few  years, hurricanes pose serious threats  to our country. Unfortunately, massive  storms can result in casualties, deaths,  and millions of dollars  in economic  damage and destruction. During hurricanes, homes,  businesses  and  other  buildings can be damaged by heavy  rain, strong winds, and storm surge.  Homes can be flooded. Tornadoes can  be spun off, and power can be wiped out  for  days  or weeks  and  sometimes  longer.  Experts at NOAA’s National Hurricane Center in the National Weather  Service agree that it is critical to do a  few things: Number one, to determine  if you live in a hurricane-prone area.  Much of Florida is. Also, know your  home’s vulnerabilities to storm surge,  flooding, wind, and develop a written  family  disaster  plan  based  on  this  knowledge.  Once you  determine your  vulnerability to a hurricane, the National  Hurricane  Center  recommends  that  people in hurricane-prone areas, such  as Florida, assemble a disaster supply  kit before the hurricane season begins.  Be ready now; don’t wait until the  storm  is on  its way. That  includes  things like a first aid kit with essential  medications, and nonperishable  food  items such as canned goods; at least 3  gallons of water per person per day for  at least 3 to 7 days, and that is crucial.  You might be able to survive without a  lot of things, but you cannot survive  without clean water. They recommend  battery-powered radios and flashlights  and extra batteries; and special items,  including  formula  for  infants,  and  medications  for  elderly  or  disabled  family members.  As we have learned in south Florida,  the forecasters, the meteorologists and  hurricane specialists at the National  Hurricane Center are often the best  source of the most valuable information on hurricane preparedness. They  spend countless hours providing valuable information and warnings to individuals located in the potential path of  a hurricane, and millions of Americans  have come to rely on their steady advice and counsel.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Americans  living in hurricane-prone areas to use  Hurricane Preparedness Week as an opportunity to learn more about the approaching hurricane season and to be  prepared before a hurricane threatens  our land. We must all learn from our  experiences and be prepared.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

295,Senate,110,0.257,83,2007-05-21,Mr. DOMENICI.," Madam President, I  thank the Senator from Florida for his  dedicated work on this bill and for his  efforts heretofore a couple of years ago,  when he worked very hard on  this  issue. We  didn’t have  success,  but  maybe this bill, in spite of all the early  talk against it, may succeed. Maybe  with some amendments and some work  it may become the new law with reference to illegal aliens for the United  States of America. It is good enough  for America. It is sufficiently clear for  America. It will clear up the status of  the  10  to  12 million undocumented  aliens who live here. It will clear that  problem up. Everywhere you look, we  have let the problems of illegal aliens  grow out of all proportions.  It is a hard job to put a bill like this  together. It is not easy. It is one of the  most difficult jobs you can have to put  legislation together to try to fix the  last 15 years of letting our laws be ignored. We have not cared about them,  letting the borders become porous, letting millions of people  in  illegally,  which has caused all kinds of problems.  But I can tell you, if you look at this  bill carefully and you don’t look at it  with any preconceived  ideas or  ideology, but look at it and ask: What are  the practical problems and what are  the practical solutions here? I submit  that it comes close to solving these  problems in the very best way possible.  I am sorry I already heard this morning Senators talking for a very long period  of  time  about why  they  are  against this bill. In the end, I listened  and, after listening, I concluded that  most of them had it wrong. I don’t like  to say that about my fellow Senators,  but they had it wrong on the major  issues, which they said made up their  mind to be against the bill.  Let me tell you what is going to happen under this bill. Before anything  else in this bill is used or implemented,  our borders must be secure. Let me repeat: whatever you hear from Senators  that this bill is going to do, none of  those provisions are going to be implemented unless and until we have secured the border. I don’t know how we  can say it any clearer. Senator KENNEDYand Senator JONKYL from Arizona, the leaders on each side on this  issue with Senator SPECTER, maybe  what you are going to have to do is  pull the text of this bill that secures  the border and distribute it to the Senators so they will have it right in front  of them to see that there is a border security part of this bill. It is there. It  says, before you can  implement the  other provisions of this bill, the border  will be made secure.  It doesn’t stop there. It tells you  what a secure border is. It says 18,000  Border Patrol agents must be hired. We  are well on a path of getting them  hired and trained. We can do this because we finally, for the last 3 years,  we have been funding. We have been  hiring thousands of them. But the bill  says none of the bill’s other provisions  shall go into effect until the border is  made secure.  Then it says that secure means 370  miles of border fencing must be built.  The Department of Homeland Security  is committed to building 370 miles by  December 31, 2008. We are being honest.  We didn’t have to say that date. We  didn’t have to talk about it. But we  cannot get fencing built any sooner. So  that period of time is going to have to  be used before we do other things in  the bill. The bill cannot change anybody’s status this year because those  provisions are dormant until the border is made secure. They are dormant.  It also says 200 miles of vehicular  barriers must be in place. It says 70  radar and camera towers must be on  the southern border. It says four unmanned aerial vehicles must be in operation we have to leave undocumented  aliens apprehended on the border in detention facilities to wait until they are  deported. Right now if you don’t have a  place  for  them,  the  judges  release  them. That has been one of our problems. The bill has 27,500 detention beds  to end  the  ‘‘catch and  release program’’, which we are aware of, those of  us who represent the border. You have  to have all that done before the bill becomes operative.  So if any one of those is not done, it  is just like not having an immigration  reform bill; isn’t that correct?  ",2007

297,Senate,110,-0.374,104,2007-05-21,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to introduce a joint resolution  that would grant the consent of Congress to the International Emergency  Management Assistance Memorandum  of Understanding, IEMAMOU compact.  This  joint resolution would  formally  approve of the IEMAMOU compact, a  mutual  emergency assistance agreement entered into by the New England  States,  including my home State of  Vermont and several Canadian Provinces, who are our neighbors to the  north. This mutual assistance compact, which has been agreed to and operating in principle for more than 5  years, allows for cooperation between  emergency responders  in the United  States and Canada during natural disasters and other serious emergencies.  This compact is an extraordinary example of the international cooperation  and good will which makes our countries more  secure  and  our  citizens  safer. Congress should pass this joint  resolution to give this vital compact  the full force of law.  We must all do our best to prepare  for the most serious emergencies that  can harm our communities. These crises may arise from natural or manmade disasters, or from technological  hazards or civil emergencies. As those  who live in the Northeast know, extreme weather  is not uncommon  in  New England, or in the eastern Provinces of Canada. Together with our Canadian neighbors, we have endured catastrophic blizzards and ice storms over  the years that have closed roads and  highways,  shut down power  for extended periods, and stranded travelers  and rural residents for days, or longer.  At times, we have also suffered the  misfortune of responding to serious accidents, such as train or plane crashes.  Of course, our concerns for safety surrounding  nuclear  powerplants  and  other industrial sites warrants extensive planning and preparedness for even  the possibility of technological disasters. During these events, we turn to  our first responders and our emergency  management professionals to provide  assistance and secure public safety no  matter how grave the danger, and no  matter how challenging the task.  The IEMMOU compact was created in  response to the devastating ice storm  of 1998. In January of that year, an unprecedented 3-day ice storm paralyzed  portions of the northern New England  States  and  the  adjacent  Canadian  Provinces causing massive damage to  the electrical and transportation infrastructure. Millions were  left  in  the  dark for days and even weeks, leaving  more than 30 dead and shutting down  normal activities in large cities like  Montreal and Ottawa. Following this  devastation,  the governors and premiers of those regions affected recognized the need for greater cross-border  emergency cooperation, and they directed  their emergency management  leaders to develop and create a memorandum  of  understanding  on  these  issues that benefit all parties north  and  south  of  the  border.  The  IEMAMOU compact was the result of  this collaborative, international process, and now stands as a model compact  for  cross-border mutual  emergency assistance.  The compact allows for international  sharing of resources and expertise in  times of extreme emergency or disaster. For example, rural States, such  as my own, may need to call upon specialized resources found in other larger  States or neighboring Provinces to respond immediately to events, such as  chemical disasters or mass transit accidents. With natural disasters, such as  prolonged, severe winter storms, the  areas affected may be so vast, stretching across several States or Provinces  that no single jurisdiction alone could  respond fully to the crisis. There are  also events that occur along or near  our border with Canada which require  the  immediate response and  full cooperation of States and Provinces in  both nations. The IEMAMOU compact  meets these needs with a thoughtful  and forward-looking outline of how to  address issues that face first responders and their managers  in times of  cross-border emergency.  This international compact provides  a legal framework for cooperation and  mutual assistance between the States  of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine,  Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and the Canadian Provinces  of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward  Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. The compact  requires  each participating member,  whether State or Province, to formulate plans and programs to facilitate  international and interstate or provincial cooperation in case of natural or  manmade disaster, technological hazard, or civil emergency. The compact  also provides for the temporary suspension of statutes or ordinances in each  jurisdiction that may impede the implementation of these plans. For example, under the compact, government officials and law enforcement authorities  from one member State or Province  can officially work in other jurisdictions during times of emergency, a circumstance that would not be permitted  otherwise.  The compact also creates a formal  mechanism for making assistance requests from one state or province to  another, and encourages frequent consultation between the emergency management  leaders to develop  free exchange of  information and resources  across borders. In addition, the compact provides a Good Samaritan provision, which gives liability protection  for emergency responders who act in  good faith in providing assistance in a  legal  jurisdiction outside their own,  and creates reciprocal workers compensation and other benefits to emergency responders who may get injured  in responding to an emergency under  the compact. Finally, the compact allows for reimbursement between members States or Provinces for losses or  damages incurred in responding under  the agreement.  All members of this compact have  agreed to its terms and join in requesting Congress’s consent for the agreement.  Vermont,  New  Hampshire,  Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode  Island,  and  Connecticut  have  joined  the  IEMAMOU compact, and many of these  States have passed legislation adopting  the compact under State law. The Premiers of Quebec, Prince Edward Island,  Labrador, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have similarly approved of the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:21 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S21MY7.REC S21MY7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007
298,,110,-0.408,118,2007-05-21,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker.  I  rise  today  in  support of S. Con. Res. 21, a budget resolution designed and drafted by Democrats  to  end over a decade of Republican fiscal irresponsibility.  One of  the best results of  the Democrats  gaining the majority in the Congress is the fact  that we can realign the priorities of the Federal  government. Instead of Republican tax cuts for  the richest 1 percent, we can put those same  resources into health care for our children and  veterans. Instead of driving our Nation deeper  and deeper into debt, we can put us back on  track towards a balanced budget.  Twelve years of Republican budgets have  left our  fiscal house  in shambles. We are  nearly $9 trillion in debt, and if Republicans  had their way, we would never end the deficit.  However, the Democratic budget resolution is  a good first step towards ending the sea of  red ink on our budget. Within the next 5 years,  we will have balanced the budget, while at the  same  time providing necessary services  to  those who need them most.  This budget resolution incorporates the pay-  as-you-go rule that the Democrats passed as  one of our first acts in the majority. The rule  is simple. Any additional funds we spend, or  any taxes that we cut, have to be paid for with  cuts in other areas.  The budget resolution finally fulfills some of  the promises we made  to our military veterans. This legislation includes a $6.6 billion  increase  in veterans spending, which  is  the  largest increase in history. The Congress has  failed to meet our obligations for over a decade in providing necessary services to our veterans, and this budget aims to correct some of  this neglect.  In addition,  this budget also provides $50  billion over 5 years towards children’s health  care. The State Children’s Health  Insurance  Program  (SCHIP) has been extremely successful in improving access to healthcare for  children whose parents earn too much money  to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to purchase private health insurance. Two-thirds of  all uninsured children in this nation are actually eligible but not enrolled  in SCHIP. With  this  budget, we  can  significantly  improve  health care coverage to millions more children  across the country.  This budget resolution will also help protect  our Nation  from  its enemies. The 9/11 recommendations, most of which have been ignored by the Republican Congress, can be implemented under this budget framework. We  have  also  included  additional  funding  for  homeland security  in order  to better ensure  the safety of our citizens.  It is no great secret that the Administration  has severely underfunded schools across the  nation with the No Child Left Behind Act. This  is another program we intend to fix with our  budget resolution. In this budget, we have included $9.5 billion over what the President requested for fiscal year 2008. This necessary  funding will help stop the decline in our Nation’s education system.  Mr. Speaker, I do not have nearly enough  time  to speak about all  the benefits of  this  budget  resolution. Programs such as Head  Start, LIHEAP, Social Security and Medicare  all benefit. Residents of New Orleans and Mississippi benefit from the money to rebuild after  Katrina. Higher education students will benefit  from increased Pell Grants and we avoid cutting other student aid programs such as Perkins  loans  and  special  opportunity  block  grants, which was proposed in the President’s  failed budget plan.  I am strongly supportive of this Democratic  budget resolution. This bill will go a long way  towards putting our fiscal house in order, without relying on the massive middle class tax increase that the President’s budget relies upon.  I would urge all of my colleagues to support  this budget resolution.  f  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008  SPEECHOF  HON. GWEN MOORE  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 16, 2007  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 1585) to authorize  appropriations for fiscal year 2008 for military activities of the Department of Defense,  to prescribe military personnel strengths for  fiscal year 2008, and for other purposes:  ",2007
299,,110,-0.53,118,2007-05-21,Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin.," Madam Chairman, as we debate the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill, I am pleased to note the effort  by my colleagues  in working  to ensure  that  our national defense funding and policy are focused on programs that will make our country  safer and provide our  troops  in harm’s way  with the resources they need today.  I support making sure that Congress wisely,  as well as robustly, provide  for our national  defense, including ensuring dollars are spent  on systems that will actually protect our Nation  and our allies. One of those systems drawing  new attention during this debate is missile defense. Our country has already spent over  $100 billion over the last several decades to  develop  various missile  defense  systems.  These Cold War efforts for which annual funding has increased from $3 billion in the late  1990s to nearly $10 billion have yet to bear  fruit, even as our country  faces  the grave  threat posed by  terrorists smuggling nuclear  weapons into our country across our borders  or through our ports.  Supporters will point to successful tests recently of portions of this system. However, we  all know the challenges of replicating limited  success  from  carefully and highly  scripted  tests in real world conditions. Given that participants knew  roughly when  the  test  target  would launch, what they would look like, how  they would fly and what they would do, it may  be even more concerning that these systems  missed as often as they did.  I am troubled when I hear experts such as  the Government Accountability Office  report  that while costs have grown,  less work  is  being completed  than planned. GAO  found  that  ‘‘too  few  tests have been completed  to  have confidence  in  the models and simulations used to predict performance.’’ One year  after establishing 2006 goals for the program,  the Missile Defense agency  informed Congress that it planned to field fewer assets, reduce performance goals, and  increase  the  program’s cost goal.  Our citizens and our allies and their citizens  are not made safer by rushing to deploy technology that ‘‘may’’ protect them when called  upon.  The solution to a flat tire is not to blow more  air into it. We cannot afford to expend valuable national defense dollars to develop technologies that we know today will not work at  a time when these funds can be spent to improve our homeland security, provide needed  equipment  for our  troops  in  the  field, or  increase foreign aid to our allies.  I am sure there is no need to remind my  colleagues that the $8.1 billion provided in the  bill for the missile system is more than is currently authorized for port security grants or included in the recent House-passed COPS reauthorization bill to put more police officers on  our streets.  Some have attempted to muddle this issue  by inserting the nation of Israel into the missile  defense issue. Our Nation recognizes the importance of our ally Israel and provides over  $2 billion in foreign military aid to help that nation meet its unique security challenges. However, simply putting more unproven,  insufficiently tested, and unreliable missile defense  systems  into  the  field does not make our  country or our allies safer.  I certainly believe the purpose of this $645  billion Defense authorization bill  is  to help  make our country safer including assisting our  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:56 May 22, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A21MY8.014 E21MYPT1 S K R A M E R M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

301,House,110,0.547,2,2007-06-05,Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.," Mr.  Speaker, Memorial Day last week in  Baghdad will always be special to me.  On that day, I met with General David  Petraeus,  Iraq’s  Defense  Minister  Jasim, and U.S. and Iraqi troops in a  Joint Security Station deep in the City  of Baghdad.  Then CODEL Spratt spent 2 days in  Kabul briefed by ISAF Commander Dan  McNeil, Major General Robert Durbin,  Afghan  Defense  Minister  Wardak,  President Hamid Karzai, and Brigadier  General Robert Livingston. General  Livingston commands the 218th Brigade of the South Carolina Army National Guard, which leads Task Force  Phoenix to train the Afghan army and  police.  I saw firsthand our coalition forces  stopping terrorists overseas to protect  American families at home. This meets  the threat of al Qaeda’s Zawahiri that  Iraq and Afghanistan are the central  front in the global war on terrorism.  Our capable military  leaders  should  not have their initiatives handcuffed  by Congress.  As we heard a bombing in Baghdad,  we read simultaneously of attacks in  Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Yemen, Lebanon  and Gaza. We must not  ignore  the  worldwide threats.  Congratulations to law enforcement  for stopping the bombing of JFK Airport.

302,House,110,0.616,2,2007-06-05,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to speak on a subject that is  first on the minds and the wallets of  the American public, and that is the  cost of rising energy prices.  We are in the middle of the summer,  and prices at the pump are above $3 a  gallon in much of America. The liberal  leadership was going to fix the high gas  prices, and they have responded by offering no solutions. They offered so-  called ‘‘price gouging’’ legislation, but  it did nothing to address the root problem of high gas prices.  The American public wants innovation, not procrastination. They want  energy exploration, not bureaucratic  red tape. They want this Congress to do  their jobs and put forth a plan that will  power this country, self sufficiently,  into this century and beyond. The liberal leadership, meanwhile, is missing  in action on the issue.  America needs to change the way we  look at how we produce energy, and in  the next couple of weeks the Republican Conference will take the lead in  unfurling a long-term energy plan for  the future. It will not only address our  immediate power concerns but those  for decades to come.  f  ONE MORE PEACE OFFICER SHOT  BY ONE MORE ILLEGAL  (Mr. POE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

A few things of note. I continue to  follow, as the chairman knows, the occurrences  in the  former captive nations, the European Union countries,  and mostly the Baltic countries, and it  seems like we can never get to forgiveness. It seems like countries always go  back to another point in time to address their grievances.  I’ve  been  on  the  floor numerous  times to talk about Molotov-Ribbentrop, and we’ve debated that and we’ve  voted on that resolution.

308,House,110,-0.119,44,2007-06-05,Mr. CARNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the Leader, and I rise in support of this  resolution. Ethics reform must be more  than rhetorical. It simply must be real.  I, like many of my colleagues, came to  Congress with a promise that corruption should not be tolerated from either party. This is not about partisan  politics, but this is rather about upholding strong ethical standards.  I was extremely disappointed to hear  that another Member of Congress was  indicted on such serious charges and  this is not something that we can take  lightly. A Member of Congress under  such  serious  charges  really  should  think long and hard about whether or  not they can remain in Congress.  This  is truly about  justice, about  doing the right things for the Member  of Congress and for the Member of Congress’ constituents.  Should the Member, in fighting these  allegations, think hard about stepping  down? Can the Member truly defend  himself or herself and adequately represent the constituents of his or her  district?  This is something I think that people  under indictment should consider, as  well I would encourage Mr. JEFFERSON  to take this under advisement and encourage him to step down.  I rise in support of this resolution. Ethics Reform must be more than rhetorical—it must be  real. I came to Congress with a promise that  corruption should not be tolerated from either  party. This is not about partisan politics; it is  about upholding strong ethical standards.  I was extremely disappointed  to hear  that  another Member of Congress  is  indicted on  such serious charges and  this  is not something that can be taken lightly. A Member of  Congress under serious  indictment does not  belong  in  the United States House of Representatives.  It is my hope that this situation with Congressman JEFFERSONcan be resolved quickly  and judiciously. However, given the serious allegations and ethical  issues  the  indictment  presents, I call on Congressman JEFFERSON to  resign  from  the U.S. House of Representatives.  ",2007
309,House,110,-0.282,44,2007-06-05,Mr. PERLMUTTER.," Mr. Speaker, my  position is similar to that of the gentleman from Pennsylvania.  I had the opportunity the last 2 days  to be down in the gulf coast, to be in  New Orleans today, and quite frankly,  is entitled to a presumption of innocence. That is the way  of our judicial system and our code in  this country.  Mr. Speaker, first, I rise in support of  this resolution. An investigation needs  to be conducted. We need to have the  Ethics Committee take a look at this.  But  I would also  suggest  to  this  House that when someone, anyone, is  under indictment, it’s a difficult position for him to do justice to himself or  herself and to also do justice for their  particular district, and those concerns  were raised by people in New Orleans  today, as well as in the newspaper.  So, as with Mr. CARNEY, I would suggest that the Ethics Committee take a  good long look at this, that Mr. JEFobviously is going to take a  good long look. I would suggest that he  do justice to himself, prepare his defense, and that his district have someone else.  ",2007

Democrats and Republicans  alike share the blame for outrageous  ethical  lapses that have occurred  in  Congress. In order to rebuild the trust  of the American people and restore integrity to this great House, it is clear  that we need to change the way ethics  rules are enforced.  While I am pleased that the House  will  consider  legislation  tonight  to  strengthen enforcement of ethics rules,  I would like to reiterate the need to  create an independent ethics office.

Much has been said, and quite correctly so, about Senator THOMASas a  cowboy, and certainly he was, and his  rich heritage of experience in the Marine Corps, as he volunteered to serve  his country after college. But I want to  stress two or three things that perhaps  have not come to the attention of Senators in the same way this morning,  one of which is that CRAIGTHOMASwas  a person who was vitally interested in  the Far East. He served for a period of  time on the Foreign Relations Committee, and during that period of time,  as  I  recall,  was  either  the  subcommittee  chairman or heavily  involved in hearings and in working with  our Ambassadors to countries in Asia.

Dr. Busch was a medical pioneer in Ventura  County, California.  In  the 1960s, Dr. Busch  and his partner, M. Kathleen Belton, MD, became the first anesthesiologists to practice in  Ventura County. They covered St. John’s Hospital  in Oxnard, Santa Paula Memorial Hospital, Community Memorial Hospital  in Ventura, and occasionally Ojai Valley Community  Hospital. Dr. Busch served at Santa Paula  Memorial Hospital for twenty years and retired  from Community Memorial Hospital in 1989.  Dr. Busch came to California after serving in  the South Pacific with the U.S. Navy for four  years, after graduating from high school, college, and medical school in the Midwest. He  interned at University of Southern California,  Los Angeles County Hospital and then practiced at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Burbank for  the next ten years.  In 1959, he married Deborah  ‘‘Deedee’’  Bennett of Palm Springs. As their family grew,  they decided to seek the country life of Ventura County. It was a good choice for them  and  for Ventura County. Ralph and Deedee  have been blessed with six children and eighteen grandchildren.  In addition to his dedication to his practice  and his family, Dr. Busch dedicated himself to  the greater medical community and the community in which he lived. He was a past member of the California and American Societies of  Anesthesiology, Ventura County Medical Society, Community Memorial Hospital Board of  Directors, Ventura County Museum of History  and Art Board of Directors, and Berry Petroleum Co. Board of Directors. He was a forty-  five-year member of Saticoy Country Club.  Madam Speaker, I know my colleagues will  join me  in  remembering Dr. Ralph Bering  Busch, Jr., as a good friend, a loving family  man, a pioneer in Ventura County medicine,  and one who worked to make his community  stronger.  In addition,  I know my colleagues  join me  in  extending  our  condolences  to  Deedee and their family and to all who called  Ralph a friend.  Godspeed, Ralph.  f  TRIBUTE TO MR. ROBERT M.

Born  in Clarksburg, West Virginia on May  15, 1920, Mr. Steptoe grew up in north central  West Virginia and  thereafter attended Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He  continued his studies at Haverford College in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Shepherd College in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.  At the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Steptoe  served in the United States Navy as the commanding officer of two ships in the sub-chaser  class. Mr. Steptoe was involved in the invasions of Sicily, Anzio, southern France, and a  brief stint in the Southern Pacific. He retired  from the United States Navy with the rank of  lieutenant commander.  Following his service during World War II,  Mr. Steptoe graduated from the University of  Virginia School of Law in February 1949 and  began a career in law that spanned over 50  years of distinguished  legal practice  in Martinsburg, West Virginia. A member of the West  Virginia State Bar, the West Virginia Bar Association, the Berkeley County Bar Association,  and the United States Judicial Conference for  the Fourth Circuit; Mr. Steptoe was awarded  the Award of Merit by the West Virginia Bar  Association in 2003 in recognition of his years  of service.  Mr. Steptoe was also an active public servant who was elected  to  the West Virginia  House of Delegates  for  four  terms and  the  West Virginia Senate for two terms. He also  served as a judge of the West Virginia Court  of Claims.  In addition to his professional activities, Mr.  Steptoe was an active member of the Rotary,  Trinity Episcopal Church, and a member of the  Elks Club. Above all, Mr. Steptoe was a proud  and dedicated husband,  father, grandfather,  and great-grandfather.  Mr. Steptoe’s life and accomplishments are  truly representative of the courage, character  and altruism  that  is often associated with  members of our ‘‘Greatest Generation.’’ West  Virginia was well served by this great American and he will be sorely missed by  those  who knew him.  f  TRIBUTE TO EDWARD L.

Mr. Venable had two passions—farming and  public  service. He  served on  the Lincoln  County Quorum Court for 24 years and was a  member  of  the Grady City Council. Mr.  Venable was a retired farmer recognized as  an accomplished agriculturist who won multiple awards at the Arkansas State Fair and  was a past recipient of the Farm Family of the  Year Award.  Mr. Venable spent a lifetime giving back to  his community and his dedication and numerous contributions to agriculture will never be  forgotten. Anyone who ever knew him will always remember his smile and good-natured  spirit as he always made time for anyone who  wanted to talk.  Perhaps most important was Mr. Venable’s  gracious nature which he bestowed upon his  fellow man, something that was deep-seated  in his strong faith. He was an active, lifelong  member of the First Baptist Church of Grady  where he served as a Deacon. In addition, his  humble  influence and natural ability  to  lead  was evident in all he did. He was a charter  member and past President of  the Grady  Lion’s Club, a member of  the Long Lake  Drainage Board, the Lincoln County Farm Bureau, and the Big Island Hunting Club.  My deepest condolences go to his beloved  wife of 59 years, Charlene Venable of Grady;  his  two daughters, Sondra Ashcroft of Pine  Bluff and Billie  Issacs of Grady; his  three  grandchildren Lee Drake of Star City, Christian  Ashcraft of Pine Bluff and Britten Ashcraft of  Pine Bluff; and  to his  three brothers Clyde  Venable of Grady, Leonard Venable of Little  Rock, and Robert Venable of Grady. Harold  Venable will be greatly missed in Grady, Lincoln County, and throughout the state of Arkansas.  f  PROVIDING  FOR  CONSIDERATION  OF H.R. 2317, LOBBYING TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF  H.R.  2316, HONEST LEADERSHIP  AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF  2007  SPEECHOF  HON.

343,House,110,0.211,3,2007-06-11,Mr. LATOURETTE.," Madam Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, today we recognize  the 50th anniversary of Lake Sidney  Lanier, an Army Corps of Engineers facility located in the State of Georgia.  Lake Lanier is one of 464 lakes in 43  States constructed and operated by the  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Our Nation is blessed with considerable water resources that support our  Nation’s economy and quality of life.  We need water for our homes, farms  and  factories. Water  also  supports  navigation, generates power and sustains our environment.  Congress authorized the Buford Dam  Project in 1946 just after the end of the  Second World War. Groundbreaking for  the project began in 1950. Constructed  by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  Lake Lanier is a multipurpose, 38,000-  acre lake that provides flood protection, power production, water supply,  navigation,  recreation, and  fish and  wildlife management.  Nestled in the foothills of the Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains, Lake Sidney  Lanier  is one of America’s  favorite  lakes. Over 7.5 million people a year  choose to visit Lake Lanier. With over  692 miles of shoreline, the lake is well  known for its aqua-blue colored water,  spectacular scenery and variety of recreational activities.  When completed, the total cost of  construction,  including  land acquisition, was almost $45 million. When the  gates of the dam were closed in 1956, it  took more than 3 years for the lake to  reach its normal elevation of 1,070 feet  above sea level.  The lake is named for one of the Nation’s most famous poets, Sidney Lanier. Born in Georgia in 1842, Mr. Lanier entered Oglethorpe College at 14  years of age, graduating at the top of  his class in 1860.  While serving on the blockade runner  ‘‘Lucy’’ during the Civil War, Mr. Lanier was captured and contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned in Maryland. Following the Civil War, Mr. Lanier played the flute for the Peabody  Symphony and lectured at Johns Hopkins University.  While he  is known  for works  like  ‘‘The Harlequin of Dreams,’’  ‘‘In Absence,’’  ‘‘Acknowledgement,’’  and  ‘‘Sunrise,’’ he is best remembered for  ‘‘The Song of the Chattahoochee,’’ an  enduring legacy for the native Georgian.

Virginia  legalizing interracial marriage within  the United States.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 431  Whereas the first anti-miscegenation law  in the United States was enacted in Maryland in 1661;  Whereas miscegenation was typically a felony under State laws prohibiting interracial  marriage punishable by  imprisonment or  hard labor;  Whereas in 1883, the Supreme Court held in  Pace v. Alabama that anti-miscegenation  laws were consistent with the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment as long as  the punishments given to both white and  black violators are the same;  Whereas in 1912, a constitutional amendment was proposed  in the House of Representatives prohibiting interracial marriage  ‘‘between negroes or persons of color and  Caucasians’’;  Whereas in 1923, the Supreme Court held in  Meyer v. Nebraska  that  the due process  clause of the 14th Amendment guarantees  the right of an individual ‘‘to marry, establish a home and bring up children’’;  Whereas in 1924, Virginia enacted the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which required  that a racial description of every person be  recorded at birth and prevented marriage between  ‘‘white persons’’ and non-white persons;  Whereas in 1948, the California Supreme  Court overturned the State’s anti-miscegenation statutes, thereby becoming the first  State high court to declare a ban on interracial marriage unconstitutional and making California the first State to do so in the  20th century;  Whereas  the California Supreme Court  stated in Perez v. Sharp that ‘‘a member of  any of these races may find himself barred  from marrying the person of his choice and  that person to him may be  irreplaceable.  Human beings are bereft of worth and dignity by a doctrine that would make them as  interchangeable as trains’’;  Whereas by 1948, 38 States still  forbade  interracial marriage, and 6 did so by State  constitutional provision;  Whereas in June of 1958, 2 residents of the  Commonwealth of Virginia—Mildred Jeter, a  black/Native American woman, and Richard  Perry Loving, a Caucasian man—were married in Washington, DC;  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:34 Jun 12, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11JN7.004 H11JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007
345,House,110,0.69,10,2007-06-11,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation adds a  technical clarification  to  the  Inter-  American Foundation Act. By background,  this  bill would  amend  the  Inter-American  Foundation  Act  to  clarify that the President may appoint  the U.S.  executive  director  of  the  Inter-American Development Bank, or  IADB, or his alternate to serve as a  member of  the Board of  the  Inter-  American Foundation.  The Inter-American Foundation Act  requires that three members of the  nine-member board ‘‘shall be appointed  from among officers or employees of  agencies of  the United States  concerned with inter-American affairs.’’  The authors of this legislation appear  to believe the clarification is necessary  because some have recently questioned  whether or not a U.S. executive director to an international financial institution, or IFI, like the IADB, is actually an officer or employee of agencies  of the United States.  I would note simply that this question  is  largely a nonissue. To my  knowledge, never before has Congress  questioned whether a U.S. executive director could concurrently serve on the  Inter-American Foundation’s board.  Indeed, any experience with the day-  to-day operations of the international  financial  institutions would  suggest  that the U.S. executive directors to  IFIs effectively function as officers or  employees of the United States. In this  regard the World Bank Web site states  that ‘‘the U.S. executive director is an  employee of the U.S. Department of  Treasury and is supported by an alternate executive director for the United  States, as well as a team of advisers  representing different executive branch  agencies.’’  The U.S. representatives to the IFIs  receive detailed instructions from the  Secretary of the Treasury regarding  the position of the United States Government on all votes pending before  the board, as well as on all outstanding  policy matters. The U.S. representatives to these institutions are also eligible to receive employee benefits, and  the Treasury Department serves as the  employing  office  for  collecting,  accounting for all retirement and health  insurance benefits payments made by  these individuals.  Having said that, passage of this act  will certainly do no harm and may  serve to help expedite the consideration of Hector Morales to serve as a  member of the Board of Directors of  the  Inter-American Foundation. Mr.  Morales  is currently  serving as  the  United States executive director of the  Inter-American Development Bank, a  position to which he was appointed  after receiving the advice and consent  of the Senate in November 2004. The  position on the Board of Inter-American Foundation would be a part-time  appointment.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  ",2007
346,House,110,0.402,17,2007-06-11,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 226 recognizes  American  government  officials who  played a critical role in the creation of  the War Refugee Board in an effort to  help rescue Jews and other persecuted  minorities during the Holocaust.  In the early stage of World War II,  there was an extensive flow of information about the extent of Jews and other  minorities being systematically murdered by the Nazi regime.  A heroic group of U.S. Government  officials  from  the Treasury Department, including Secretary of the Treasurer, Henry Morganthau, as well as Joseph DuBois and John Pehle, urged  President Franklin Roosevelt to take  more direct and forceful action to help  the victims of the Nazi atrocities.  President Roosevelt later signed an  executive order creating the War Refugee Board. Mr. John Pehle became the  executive director of the board which  helped to rescue Jews and other victims of Nazi persecution and prevented  thousands of people from dying in extermination camps.  Furthermore, the board assisted the  International Red Cross to provide food  and shelter to over 3 million prisoners  of war. Efforts by those who worked to  establish the War Refugee Board, particularly  of  Secretary  of Treasury  Henry Morganthau, Joseph DuBois, and  John Pehle, were instrumental in saving thousands of lives during the Nazi  extermination policy.  H. Res.  226  recognizes and honors  these government officials for their efforts, and I urge support for this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2007
347,House,110,-0.432,24,2007-06-11,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Madam Speaker, I rise today in the wake of news  that  comes  to us  that  the United  States will now have as a policy in Iraq  the arming of Sunni groups who have  admittedly killed and maimed Americans. We have now reached the point of  public-political lunacy.  Representative PAUL, myself, Representative JONESand others have entered a bill  for consideration of the  House that will cause us to have to reauthorize this war. Any conceivable  reason for having allowed the President to enter into this war with the enabling resolution that we passed has  now been accomplished; any  ‘‘whereas,’’ any ‘‘be it resolved’’ of that resolution is now moot.  In order  for any of us to  justify  spending one more penny or committing one more soldier of the United  States into this war, we have to have  an  up-or-down  vote  on whether  it  should be authorized.  Arming Sunni groups that have murdered U.S. service men and women as a  policy, a strategy, is without merit and  devoid of any political sensibility.  f  b1930  SPECIAL ORDERS  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. SUTTON).

348,House,110,-0.283,31,2007-06-11,Mr. MICHAUD.,"  Thank  you  very  much, Representative SA´NCHEZ. And  you’re absolutely right. These trade  deals are a slippery slope, and we definitely have  to make  sure  that we  change that trade model.  As you know, I spent over 28 years at  Great Northern Paper Company in East  Millinocket, Maine, like my father before me spent 43 years, my grandfather  before him for 40 years.  NAFTA has killed our community.  We used to have over 4,500 jobs. It’s little over 500 jobs. Small businesses have  gone under because the economy has  been devastated because of a  trade  deal. We had unemployment that was  over 33 percent.  We had  individuals who are proud  men and women who worked  in the  mill, made good wages, good health  care benefits, they ended up on the  food line. They are so many people that  went to the food bank that actually  the  food bank ran out of  food. The  whole State chipped  in and brought  food, churches, communities throughout the State to help the devastation.  And it doesn’t end there. If you go 30  miles south, another mill had closed its  doors. Another 30 miles south of that,  another mill closed its doors because of  trade.  Yes, they are getting trade assistance, but they want their jobs. And  what are they getting trained for, if  there’s no jobs to get trained?  So this definitely has caused a huge  problem, these bad trade deals in the  State of Maine, and people are upset,  and rightfully so; and that’s why it’s  important for this Congress to get off  that slippery slope and head for a new  direction, start a new direction; and  that new direction  is changing that  flawed trade policy.  And I agree 100 percent, it’s more  than just a couple of Band-Aids. We  have to look at the broader aspect of  trade.  And I really appreciate your ongoing  commitment  to do what’s  right  for  workers, to do what’s right for small  businesses in this country, and it’s the  humanitary thing to do as well. So  thank you very much, Representative  SA´NCHEZ, for your leadership in this  issue, and I’ll look forward to working  with you as we move forward to deal  with these trade issues.  I now would like to recognize a gentleman who I’ve really got to enjoy in  this Congress, a gentleman who has  really been a strong advocate for our  veterans, who definitely has been a  leader in that area on the Veterans Affairs Committee, but also a gentleman  who  is extremely  interested  in  the  trade issues, knowing what trade has  done to his State in Illinois, Congressman PHILHARE.  Thank you for coming to the floor  this evening. I look forward to hearing  your remarks as they relate to trade.  ",2007

371,,110,-0.432,136,2007-06-11,Ms. DEGETTE.," Madam Speaker,  I would  like to recognize the remarkable history and  invaluable contributions of an extraordinary  hospital  in  the 1st Congressional District of  Colorado.  It  is  fitting  that we recognize  this  outstanding  institution  for  its  leadership  in  health care and rehabilitation and for its enduring service to the people of our community  and our Nation. It is to commend this distinguished organization that I rise to honor the  Craig Hospital on the occasion of its 100th Anniversary, ‘‘Celebrating a Century of Rebuilding Lives.’’  The growing  importance of  innovation  in  health care to our well being as a society and  our quality of  life  is well documented. Craig  Hospital is a powerful community of hope and  it provides people with new possibilities. Craig  has set  the standard  for quality patient outcomes. It is an internationally recognized leader in health care and has long been recognized as a premier national center of excellence in the specialties of rehabilitation and research  for patients with spinal cord  injuries  and acquired brain injuries.  From  its  founding as  the  ‘‘Tent Colony of  Brotherly Love’’ in 1907 to the world class facility we know today, Craig Hospital continues  to be a beacon of hope and remains committed to the well being of its patients. Rehabilitation is a process very different from traditional medical care.  It  involves  teaching patients and families to care for themselves. It  requires setting high expectations and hard  work by patients to maximize neurological recovery, restore  functional abilities and make  the psychological adjustments needed  to remain as independent and productive as possible.  Since 1956, Craig Hospital has treated more  than 25,500 patients—more spinal cord injury  patients  than any other single  facility  in  the  world. Last year, Craig treated patients from  48 states and  for  the past 18 years,  it has  been ranked among the Top Ten Rehabilitation Hospitals by U.S. News and World Report. Its spinal cord and traumatic brain injury  rehabilitation programs are designated by the  U.S. National Institute on Disability Rehabilitation and Research (NIDRR) as Model Systems  Centers. Since 2006, Craig is the NIDRR National Database and Statistical Center (HDSC)  for the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems.  Craig Hospital has burnished a reputation of  compassion and legacy of care rivaled by very  few. Patients have characterized Craig Hospital as  ‘‘a miracle (that  is) here  for patient  care, not  for health care dollars;’’ as  ‘‘phenomenal at all they do for patients and families.’’ It comes as no surprise that Craig Hospital has been awarded Magnet Designation—  a national honor—by  the American Nurses  Credentialing Center for its excellence in staff  collaboration and teamwork and for the spirit  of inquiry among bed-side nurses as to what  is best for patient care. Truly we, as residents  of the 1st Congressional District, are fortunate  indeed to have an asset of such magnitude in  our community.  Please join me in commending Craig Hospital for its 100 years of leadership in health  care and its invaluable service to our community and our Nation. It is the commitment and  dedication that Craig Hospital and members of  its staff exhibit on a daily basis which continually enhances our lives and builds a better  future for all of our people.  f  CELEBRATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  NANCY  OSBORNE’S  SERVICE TO KFSN–TV ABC 30  HON.

Randy died unexpectedly last week, sending waves of shock  and sorrow through Southeastern Wisconsin,  where he was well-known  through his business and civic leadership.  Randy worked his way up  the  ladder at  Union Grove Lumber over nearly 40 years to  become CEO of this local lumber and hardware business. He also served as a member  of my Small Business Advisory Board, and I  am grateful that he took the time to share his  expertise with us. He knew the challenges that  small business owners  face day  in and day  out, and his  insights on  issues  from health  care to tax policies were very helpful. If there  was one thing you could always count on, it  was that Randy would tell you what he truly  thought, whether he agreed or disagreed with  you. His candor and his dedication to doing  what  is right  for Union Grove will be sorely  missed.  Besides working to strengthen the community as an employer and businessman, Randy  gave back in many other ways. Altogether, he  served 20 years on the Village Board. He was  active in the Union Grove Lions Club and had  served two terms as president. He also served  two  terms as president of  the Chamber of  Commerce.  In his personal life, Randy was a devoted  family man, who  recently became a grandfather. My thoughts and prayers are with his  wife,  children, granddaughter, mother, and  brother, and the many friends throughout Wisconsin who mourn his loss.  f  HONORING JUDITH REED MEHAL  HON.

O’Brien, a resident of Connecticut’s Second  Congressional District, who is celebrating his  50th year as an ordained priest.  Devoting his life to the service of others, Father O’Brien has faithfully tended to the people  of Connecticut as a pastor, teacher, principal,  and friend.  Father O’Brien was ordained on February 2,  1957, after completing his education at the St.  John Seminary in Boston. Over the past 50  years, he has served as a dedicated pastor  and educator to many Connecticut congregations. Currently, he is pastor of St. Adalbert  parish  in Enfield and director of  the parish  school.  He once said of his profession, ‘‘a teacher  affects eternity.’’ As a counselor and consummate supporter of his students, Father O’Brien  embodies  the compassionate, nurturing, and  dedicated values characteristic of our Nation’s  greatest educators.  A die hard fan of the celebrated Boston Red  Sox, Father O’Brien  is well-known  for delivering score updates to his parishioners when  a game has been  inconveniently scheduled  during a mass celebration.  I am honored to pay tribute to the Reverend  Edmund M. O’Brien. Father O’Brien’s dedication to his faith, his community, and the children under his care has been, and continues  to be, an inspiration to myself and the residents of eastern Connecticut.  f  A TRIBUTE TO TEMPLE BETH  DAVID  HON.

374,,110,-0.348,143,2007-06-11,Mr. SCHIFF.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor Temple Beth David, which will be  celebrating  its 60th anniversary  this year.  In  the past 60 years, the temple has grown into  a vibrant community dedicated to the values of  Judaism  including  spiritual  discovery,  educational richness, and the love and kindness  of community and personal responsibility.  Founded by 10  families  in 1947, Temple  Beth David was the first reform synagogue in  the San Gabriel Valley. The original founder,  Flora Kahn, is still a member of the congregation. Since its inception, the temple has seen  its membership grow to 195 families, spanning  the generations. The community welcomes all  Jews as well as interfaith couples and encourages non-Jewish spouses  to participate  in  temple life.  Rabbi Alan Lachtman has been with  the  temple in his current position since 1976. A retired Lieutenant Colonel  from  the Army Reserves, Rabbi Lachtman has a degree in Marriage Family Therapy and received the Doctorate of Divinity from Hebrew Union College  in 1999. He currently teaches at the University  of Judaism, and works closely with the American Jewish Committee and the Archdiocese  of Los Angeles.  A dynamic and active temple, Temple Beth  David  encourages  congregant  participation  and offers a wide variety of programs  from  interfaith programs and social action projects  to  religious  and  Hebrew  schools.  Demonstrating a commitment to all members of the  community, Temple Beth David offers not only  youth scholarships but also an array of adult  education programs  for  those who seek a  greater understanding of Judaism.  Committed participants not only  in  temple  life but in the larger world as well, the members of Temple Beth David have  recently  joined  the  interfaith chorus calling  for U.S.  Government intervention in Darfur. Along with  Rabbi Lachtman, the 195 families of the temple, mindful of their own community’s history,  are activists for the civilians in Darfur.  It  is my privilege  to honor Temple Beth  David on its anniversary of 60 years of active  community and fulfillment in Judaism. I ask all  members  to  join me  in wishing  the Temple  Beth David and its congregants continued success.  f  IN HONOR OF THE CAREER AND  ACHIEVEMENTS OF DR. ALBERT  J. SIMONE  HON. LOUISE McINTOSH SLAUGHTER  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 7, 2007  ",2007
375,,110,-0.465,143,2007-06-11,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to celebrate the achievements of a distinguished academic who  I am privileged  to  call my  friend, Dr. Albert  J. Simone. Dr.  Simone has served as the President of Rochester Institute of Technology since September  1, 1992, and during that time I have had the  pleasure of working with him as he advanced  the university’s reputation as a leading career-  oriented institution. He is retiring his post this  year, and his vision and  leadership will be  sorely missed.  Before taking the helm at RIT, Dr. Simone  served as president of the University of Hawaii  System and chancellor of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. He also taught at several well-  respected institutions for higher education, including  the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, Tufts University, Northeastern University, Boston College, Boston University, University of Cincinnati, and the University of Hawaii. But his achievements go far beyond administration and instruction.  Dr. Simone has authored countless publications, including books and journal articles on  the application of mathematics, statistics, and  computers to economics and business. He is  a founding editor of Decision Sciences and is  a past president and fellow of the Institute of  Decision Sciences. And, although he is retiring, he will continue to make contributions to  academia as he is currently in the process of  collecting data for a book he will be writing on  higher education.  A true trailblazer, Dr. Simone was the first  American university president to officially visit  North Korea, Vietnam, and Vladivostok when  these  regions were  closed  to  the United  States except for cultural and educational exchange. He oversaw the launch of three Ph.D.  programs at RIT in the areas of microsystems  engineering,  computing  and  information  sciences, and color science. And, under his  stewardship, six bachelor’s degree programs  have been added to the university’s offerings,  including programs in information technology,  software engineering, chemistry and polymer  chemistry, biochemistry, advertising and public  relations, and new media publishing. These  new programs represent  the university’s understanding of  the needs of  the community  outside of it, and help distinguish the City of  Rochester as a center for innovation and entrepreneurship.  Dr. Simone  led RIT’s  largest capital campaign, raising $310 million which enabled the  university to add over 210 new scholarships,  name three colleges, add seven new endowed  professorships, build nine new campus facilities, add $90 million in new applied research  initiatives, and add $34 million to the RIT endowment. This  capital  campaign enhanced  RIT’s reputation, made college education more  accessible for more students, and gave students and faculty better resources to pursue  their academic endeavors.  Thanks to Dr. Simone and the programs he  has cultivated at RIT, the university has become a strong partner  in regional economic  development efforts. His endeavors have consistently reflected his belief that the ‘‘‘R’ in RIT  means something.’’ Aside from creating academic programs at the university to address  the business needs of Rochester and the surrounding region, Dr. Simone served as chairman of  the board of  the Greater Rochester  Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, and currently serves on the boards of the Rochester  Business Alliance, the Center for Government  Research, and the Finger Lakes Partnership  for  the WIRED  initiative. His  involvement  in  these and countless other community organizations has benefited not only the organizations themselves, but also the university and  its  students by establishing  important networking opportunities and using  the knowledge from those relationships to inform the direction of the university.  Dr. Simone has been recognized by several  organizations  throughout Western New York  and the Nation for his outstanding leadership  and community involvement. He was the recipient of the Entrepreneurial American Leadership Award from Partners or Livable Communities (2006), the YWCA of Rochester and  Monroe County Racial Justice Award (2005),  the Rochester  International Council  International Citizen Award  (2004),  the National  Association of Student Affairs Professionals  President’s Award (2001), and the Rochester  Business Alliance Civic Medal among many,  many others.

Arnold was a special and caring man whose commitment to his  community could only be rivaled by his commitment to his family. He was a loving son, a  loving husband, brother, and uncle. He was, in  short, a loving man.  Anyone who knew Arnold, or  ‘‘Nub’’ as  those closest to him referred to him, could not  help but be touched by his generous and caring nature. He took a special interest in the  lives of others, and he often made those lives  a part of his own. He had an uncanny ability  to connect with people,  to make  them  feel  comfortable in his presence. He was a good  friend and a great man.  Arnold was very dedicated  to his country  and his community. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps and served with distinction in both  World War II and the Korean war. He served  the city of Bluefield, WV as a postmaster, a  fireman, and as the chief of police. His commitment  to his  community exemplified  the  motto of the Marine Corps, ‘‘semper fidelis’’,  always faithful.  After retiring from this distinguished career,  Nub dedicated his life to spreading his love of  books and opened the Appalachian Bookstore  in Bluefield.

378,,110,0.208,157,2007-06-11,Mr. WALSH of New York.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today in recognition of the town of Cicero’s 200th anniversary. Located on the southern shore of Oneida Lake, the town of Cicero  serves as a northern suburb of metropolitan  Syracuse. The  town was named after  the  great Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero.  The town of Cicero was one of the townships of the former Central New York Military  Tract. The CNY Military Tract was  land reserved for soldiers who served in the American Revolution. Cicero became a part of the  town of Lysander when Onondaga County  was formed in 1794. The town of Cicero split  from the town of Lysander in 1807. The town  of Cicero also included the town of Clay until  1827 when the township was divided.  The town contains a rich history on involvement within Central New York. The  town of  Cicero was crucial to the building of the Erie  Canal. The construction of the canal brought  many settlers  into  the  town, expanding  its  growth. The town of Cicero was also extensively  involved within  the salt  industry. The  salt industry provided many people with jobs,  either making barrels or in furnishing lumber.  When the salt mines dried up, the town’s residents turned to the agriculture and dairy industries.  Over  its history,  the  town of Cicero has  changed drastically. From a  small  farming  community, Cicero has transformed into one  of the fastest growing suburbs of the region.  It has been an honor for me to represent  the town of Cicero and its citizens for close to  20 years. The town of Cicero has provided the  Central New York region with a prime example  of a successful township filled with great people. The  residents of  the  town of Cicero  should be proud of their rich heritage. I congratulate them as they celebrate their first 200  years, and wish them nothing but the best for  next 200 more.  f  RECOGNIZING  SHANE  DARWIN  POPE  II  FOR ACHIEVING  THE  RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT  HON.

379,,110,-0.389,164,2007-06-11,Mrs. CAPPS.," Madam Speaker, today I rise  to pay tribute to Dr. Manuel (Manny) Lopez as  he celebrates his 80th birthday. Dr. Lopez has  served the Oxnard community as a doctor, an  activist, a community volunteer and as an  elected official. I am pleased to recognize Dr.  Lopez on this special day.  Born in Oxnard in 1927, Dr. Lopez attended  local schools  through high school, attended  Ventura Community College and went on to  attend DC Berkeley  for his undergraduate  education and as a student of optometry. He  returned to his community and has practiced  Optometry in Oxnard since 1962.  Before serving on the Oxnard City Council  for 12 years and then serving as mayor for 14  years, Dr. Lopez was involved with the Oxnard  Planning Commission, the Housing Authority,  the Redevelopment Agency,  the Community  Relations Commission and the Economic Development Commission. While serving as a  Member of  the Council and as mayor, Dr.  Lopez represented  the city on a number of  local and  regional committees dealing with  such issues as transportation planning, wastewater treatment, local airport policy and agricultural land preservation. He has also participated in many community groups such as the  Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic  Chamber of Commerce, the Oxnard Optimist  Club,  the Oxnard Boys and Girls Club and  many others.  As a result of his dedication to his community, Dr. Lopez was  chosen as  the 1991  Oxnard Distinguished Citizen of the Year and,  in 1992, he received the Patrick Henry Award.  In 2006 Dr. Lopez was the Grand Marshal of  the Oxnard Christmas Parade. It is my honor,  Madam Speaker, to recognize and commend  Dr. Manuel Lopez for his ongoing service to  his community on this joyous occasion of his  80th Birthday.  f  IN  CELEBRATION  OF  NATIONAL  MINORITY CANCER AWARENESS  WEEK  HON.

381,House,110,0.315,8,2007-06-19,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  First of all, let me thank Mr. OBEY,  the chairman of the committee, for his  good work with us on this bill. And I  want to add my support to Chairman  VISCLOSKYon doing a good job on his  first bill, and I will talk about that a  little bit further.  This is the first Energy and Water  appropriation bill that my colleague  from  Indiana  has  developed  and  brought to the floor. The first one, I  found out, is always the hardest one,  but he has done a great job and it is a  good bill; and I have certainly enjoyed  working with him this year in a new  position  for me also as the ranking  member on this bill.  It certainly helps to have an allocation that is $1.1 billion over the administration’s request. However, I do not  disagree with the major funding decision that the chairman has made in  this bill.  This bill  is a very thoughtful approach to some very difficult issues, including investing in our Nation’s water  infrastructure, developing domestic energy sources with less impact on global  climate, and fostering our national security through rational efforts on nuclear  nonproliferation  and  nuclear  weapons.  I want to comment briefly on a couple of specific programs and projects,  including several that Chairman VISCLOSKYhas just recently discussed. I  fully support the  increased spending  for water resources infrastructure. We  have chronically underinvested in this  infrastructure in recent years both in  this administration and,  frankly,  in  the previous administration.  b1100  And the hurricanes of 2005 taught us  some very hard lessons about the consequences of such underinvestment.

383,House,110,0.293,15,2007-06-19,Mr. SIMPSON.,"  I  tleman for yielding.  Once again this year, the bill before  us is the result of a bipartisan atmosphere in the Energy and Water Subcommittee that has been fostered by  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member HOBSON. I want to thank both  of them for the manner in which they  VISCLOSKY thank  the  genapproached the many issues before this  committee and  for producing a bill  that will pass today, I believe, with little opposition.  First, the Energy and Water bill enjoyed unanimous support in the subcommittee and near unanimous support in the full committee for the balanced and thoughtful way in which it  addresses  the  complex  energy  and  water challenges facing this Nation.  Second, the bill makes tremendous  investments  in our Nation’s critical  science and energy-related programs.  Third, the bill promotes two areas that  I believe are critical to address the energy supply challenges we face, nuclear  and alternative fuels, by employing the  vast knowledge and expertise of our national labs that includes the Idaho National Laboratory which is in my district.  Finally, the bill continues its pressure on DOE to improve project management, contain costs and stick to  schedules which are among DOE’s most  chronic and persistent problems.  In closing, I want to again recognize  the bipartisan manner in which this  bill was written and acknowledge the  tremendous work of all  the professional staff on this subcommittee.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and I thank the chairman and the  ranking member for their work on this  bill.  The  CHAIRMAN.  The  gentleman  from Ohio has 45 seconds remaining.

387,House,110,0.528,50,2007-06-19,Mr. BARTON.,"  Mr. Chairman, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Congress authorized  funding to provide loan guarantees for  any technology which reduces carbon  emissions. That was designed to help a  vast array of  technologies  such as  wind, solar, clean coal, ethanol, and  nuclear. Your committee excluded new  nuclear plants as one of  the  technologies eligible  for  loan guarantees  under the 2005 Energy Policy Act. And  as a supporter of nuclear power, I oppose that exclusion. I am concerned  that this may delay new projects that  are being planned, and I am hopeful  that these concerns can be addressed  when you reach a conference with the  Senate.  I would also note that the authorization in the energy appropriation bill is  just that, an authorization. No appropriation is required.

389,,110,0.672,239,2007-06-19,Mr. WESTMORELAND.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to recognize and honor Mrs. Wendy  Harding, the 2007 Muscogee County School  District Teacher of the Year.  Almost every student that passes through a  school,  from  the  teacher’s pet  to  the class  clown, has a fond memory of a special teacher who positively  influenced  their  lives. For  many students at Columbus’ Hardaway High  School,  that  teacher has been a Spanish  teacher named Wendy Harding.  Harding knows how  to stick with a good  thing once she’s found it. She stayed happily  married and raised two high-achieving children  with her high school sweetheart Phil, who was  also an educator, until his death from cancer  7 years ago. And Harding has spent every single day of her 31-year professional career at  Hardaway High, making her the longest-serving teacher there.  Principal Matt Bell told the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer that Harding is an integral part of  the school’s success: ‘‘She’s a leader in the  school. She teaches everyone. She heads our  mentor program. She cares about every student who comes through her doorway as well  as students who don’t.  If a student doesn’t  learn  in her class, she  takes  it personally.  They all learn at a high level. They see her  enthusiasm for her subject and her zest for life  and it’s just contagious.’’  Harding says she’s wanted  to become a  teacher since she was 7 years old. Now, she  mentors the next generation of teachers, encouraging her own students  to pick up  the  torch that enlightens young minds. Those influenced by her example include her daughter,  who last year was named First Year Teacher  of  the Year  in a Texas school district. The  skills needed to excel at the head of the classroom obviously run deep in the family blood.  I would like to personally thank Mrs. Harding  for her many years of outstanding service to  the  young  people  of Muscogee County.  Teachers such as her, across Georgia and the  United States, make  a  positive  difference  every day.  On behalf of Georgia’s 3rd Congressional  District, I congratulate the Muscogee County  Teacher of the Year and wish her many years  of continued success.  f  TRIBUTE TO DR. PETER B. AJLUNI  HON.

391,House,110,0.538,2,2007-06-27,Mr. PITTS.," Mr. Speaker, some on the  other side of the aisle made it a habit  to refer to the last session of Congress  as a do-nothing Congress. But it seems  our friends on the other side are trying  to outdo the do-nothingness they complained about all last year.  First  they  clamped  down  on  the  House rules to expedite their so-called  6 for ’06 agenda. Almost none of that  became  law. Then  they delayed an  emergency troop funding bill for more  than  100 days while our  troops  in  harm’s way waited for the resources  they needed to do their job. Now they  seem intent on playing another round  of chicken with the President over this  year’s appropriations bills.  When you throw in hidden earmarks,  slush funds, budget gimmicks and the  largest tax increase in American history, it’s no wonder the Democrat Congress is currently enjoying its lowest  approval ratings ever. Do-nothing Congress? Perhaps now we should say do-  less-than-nothing Congress.  f  LARGEST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS  IN THE WORLD  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2007
392,House,110,-0.376,2,2007-06-27,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, every  day now, it’s becoming more and more  apparent that the President’s troop escalation plan is not stemming the civil  war in Iraq.  In fact, since the plan took effect  earlier this year, violence in Iraq is up,  and our soldiers are paying a heavy  price on the battlefield. For months  now, Democrats have stood united in  our commitment to forge a new direction in Iraq, but our efforts have received very  little support  from congressional Republicans.  It  appears  that  is  beginning  to  change. Earlier this week, one of the  most respected Members of the Republican party on  international affairs,  Senator RICHARDLUGAR, said that we  must recalibrate our strategy in Iraq  to fit our domestic political conditions  and broader needs of national security.  Then  yesterday,  Senator VOINOVICH  said that he doesn’t believe the Iraqis  are going to get it until they know we  are leaving.  Both Senator LUGAR and Senator  VOINOVICH’s comments are a blow to  the White House and serve as yet another example of long-time supporters  of the President’s Iraq policy believing  we are long overdue for a new direction. It’s time for the congressional Republicans to face the reality and join  us in dramatically changing course in  Iraq.

393,House,110,-0.312,16,2007-06-27,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself as much time as I might consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this amendment.  Am going to be brief here. This would  be a devastating cut on this bill. I want  to say something to the gentleman.  These bills do have consequences.  Over the last 7 years, since this administration took power, the Interior  Department’s budget has been cut in  real terms by 16 percent. The EPA’s  budget has been cut in real terms by 29  percent, and the Forest Service budget  has been cut in real terms, taking fire  out, by 35 percent. This is one of the  few bills that has been devastated by  this administration, and it’s a regrettable fact.  All our bill does is stop this downward trend in our national parks, our  downward trend in our national wildlife refuges, and our downward trend in  enforcement and clean water and clean  air  in  the environmental protection  area, and the reduction in personnel,  not  covering  fixed  costs until Mr.  Kempthorne came in, and he is only  covering the fixed costs for the Interior  Department. This is a devastating cut  that would reverse all the good work in  this bill.  I just think it’s totally irresponsible,  and I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this. We need  the money for the firefighters, there is  a huge fire out there in Lake Tahoe  right now. We need to get this bill  passed.  This kind of across-the-board meat-  ax approach will not be successful, I  predict. I just tell the gentleman that  his amendment goes way too far and  would have devastating consequences.  It would undermine  the President’s  Centennial Challenge that Mr. Kempthorne has worked so hard to create.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time and urge a ‘‘no’’ vote  on the gentleman’s amendment.  ",2007

If you want to talk about cuts in crisis, you come out to rural Oregon,  rural Washington, rural Northern California, the areas that my friend and  colleague from Washington knows all  too well.  The largest county in my district had  15 or 16 libraries, all of which are now  shuttered and closed because this Congress and the last failed to reauthorize  the Secure County Roads and Schools  legislation that the Congress before, in  2000, put into law.  The effect of all that, and the effect  of this not going forward is those counties have a 1-year stay of execution because in the emergency supplemental  there was legislation that funded them  for one more year.  But as  the good gentleman  from  Washington State knows, with the decline in the timber industry, the decline in harvest on Federal lands, these  rural counties have been devastated.  They have no tax base in some cases,  or very little; 70, 80 percent of land  mass is Federal lands. There’s been a  commitment for 100 years by this Congress to share revenues, and then those  revenues went away. Law enforcement  is going away. Basic services. You all  would throw a fit if they went away in  Washington, D.C. or any other urban  area.  ",2007

399,House,110,0.362,65,2007-06-27,Mr. MCCRERY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself so much time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I’ve been an avid supporter  of Andean  preferences,  and  today I voice my support for this short-  term extension of the preferences. And  I want to thank Chairman RANGEL for  working with me and others to effect  what we believe should pass on the  floor today under suspension of the  rules.  Our country’s relationship with the  Andean countries of Peru, Colombia,  Ecuador and Bolivia is vitally important, and preferences have helped enormously with their economic development and with stability in the region.  At the same time, however, I believe  it is time to move to a more substantial, mature and reciprocal relationship  through  free  trade agreements.  The  unilateral  preferences  provide  duty-free treatment to products from  the region, but very limited value to  United States interests in return. The  FTAs, the free trade agreements, provide reciprocal market access benefits,  creating new opportunity  for United  States producers, farmers and exporters.  I might add that our FTAs also create greater obligations on our trading  partners than preferences by requiring  them to abide by fundamental labor  rights and certain multilateral environmental agreements.  Right now we have an immediate opportunity to implement the FTAs with  Peru and Colombia, with the possibility of future FTAs with Ecuador and  Bolivia. We should seize this opportunity now. Both Peru and Colombia  have already passed the pending FTAs,  and they are expected soon to pass  amendments to them reflecting the recently concluded bipartisan trade deal  on labor and the environment.  It’s time for our Congress here in the  United States to move these FTAs, too.  Preferences are a stopgap measure. Our  trading partners and United States interests deserve more than that. Every  day we wait is a lost opportunity to  gain the advantages of those more mature agreements.  With respect to Ecuador and Bolivia,  I  remain  very  concerned with  the  treatment of United States investors  there. This 8-month extension gives us  time to evaluate how these countries  are abiding by the preference program  requirements with respect to United  States investment. We will be watching  developments very carefully.  Mr. Speaker, I support this short-  term extension of preferences  for  8  months, which will give us the time we  need  to  implement our outstanding  free trade agreements in the region.  The first step will be to complete congressional action on the Peru agreement, I hope, before the August recess.  The time is now to solidify our relationship, instead of perpetuating what  I believe  is an unsatisfactory status  quo.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
400,House,110,-0.378,65,2007-06-27,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, as we proceed, it should be clear. We’re talking  now about  the Andean Trade Preference Act,  and we’re not  talking  about the free trade agreements that  have been discussed here.  In my view, whether one supports or  opposes any of those free trade agreements, it would be counterproductive  for someone to vote against extension  of the ATPA for 8 months.  This relates, as mentioned, to the  four nations. The original ATPA was  passed in 1991, and it was expanded and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:45 Jun 28, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A27JN7.057 H27JNPT1 N C _ E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o l e o n c         ",2007
401,House,110,0.52,72,2007-06-27,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  distinguished  gentleman  from  California for yielding. We are in disagreement about the proposed COLA.  Mr. Speaker, I oppose the proposed  cost-of-living allowance  increase because it is ill-timed. I represent constituents, as do many of you, who earn  $25,000 to $35,000 annually, and they  read  that  the Congress  approves  a  COLA  increase  for  themselves. Not  good.  According to recent polls, Americans  don’t like the Congress. Our numbers,  lower than President Bush’s numbers,  are in the tank. To enact this COLA  proposal will do nothing, in my opinion, to improve our already diminished  reputation.  Mr. Speaker, my fiscal philosophy is  very simple: Taxpayers pay our salaries, and beyond that, in my opinion,  they owe us little more. I have refused  a  congressional pension,  so when  I  leave the Congress I will receive not  one brown penny of congressional pension money, because  I don’t believe  taxpayers owe me a congressional pension just because I served in the Congress.

403,House,110,-0.465,79,2007-06-27,Mr. CLYBURN.," Mr. Speaker, I ask  unanimous  consent  that  the  Committee on Oversight and Government  Reform be discharged from further consideration of the concurrent resolution  (H. Con. Res. 172) honoring the life of  each of the 9 fallen City of Charleston  firefighters who  lost  their  lives  in  Charleston, South Carolina, on June 18,  2007, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.  ",2007
404,House,110,0.337,93,2007-06-27,Mr. REHBERG.," Mr. Chairman,  in  light of the distressing statistics regarding the Office of National Drug  Control Policy’s National Youth Media  Campaign, and  its subsequent reduction within our committee, I rise today  to let my colleagues know that it is  possible  to  design,  implement  and  evaluate youth anti-drug marketing.  Methamphetamine is a real problem  across this great Nation, and no State  is immune to its horrible effects. Montana ranks among the top 10 States nationally in per capita treatment admissions for methamphetamine use.  The statistics in Montana are truly  staggering. Fifty-two percent of the  children who are placed in out-of-home  care are there because of meth.  Fifty percent of adults incarcerated  at State prisons are there due to meth.  Twenty percent of Montanans in addiction treatment are there because of  meth.  While many people would simply nod  their heads and agree this is a terrible  problem, some good people in Montana  have taken it upon themselves to do  something about it.  Tom Siebel, who lives in Wolf Creek,  is an outstanding Montanan who did  something that many of us could not  do. He decided to use his own money to  fund a prevention campaign to help  raise awareness about the dangers of  first time methamphetamine use. Tom  Siebel  founded  the Montana Meth  Project in 2005, which has been conducting research and running a statewide multi-media  public  awareness  campaign aimed at significantly reducing  first-time methamphetamine use  through public service messaging, public policy, and community outreach.  Results from the Montana Meth Use  & Attitudes Survey conducted earlier  this year show the dramatic and successful impact that the Montana Meth  Project’s public  education  campaign  has had on its intended audience.  Over the past 2 years, there has also  been a dramatic shift in the perception  of methamphetamine use, more  frequent  parent-child  communications  about  the  dangers  of methamphetamine,  and  greater  societal  disapproval. For the first time, meth use  and associated crime in Montana has  declined.  The States of Arizona and Idaho are  using Montana’s hard-hitting ads and  I  successful approach, launching similar  youth media campaigns. Clearly, the  efforts of the Montana Meth Project  are working.  ",2007
405,House,110,-0.296,93,2007-06-27,Mr. RUPPERSBERGER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the fiscal year  2008 Financial Services Appropriation,  and I urge Members to vote for this  bill. It is an excellent bill approved by  the subcommittee unanimously. It is  below the President’s request, and fulfills our obligation to be efficient with  the  taxpayers’  dollars.  I  commend  Chairman SERRANOand Ranking Member REGULA for their  leadership and  their bipartisan achievement.  As a former prosecutor and county  executive, I am especially proud of several initiatives in the bill. I would like  it highlight one program specifically.  There is $226 million, a $6 million increase, over the President’s budget for  high-intensity drug trafficking areas.  HIDTA  funding enables  local, State  and Federal law enforcement to work  together in fighting the war against  drugs.  As a county executive in Baltimore  County, we worked with HIDTA  to  bring everyone to the table who had a  stake in stopping drug trafficking. We  don’t stop drug buys with just a single  piece of  information.  It  takes  solid  policework,  intelligence, and trained  experts analyzing information to help  officers make the drug arrests.  b2145  The HIDTA program  is making a  major impact in areas like Baltimore,  Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York and other locations.  Statistics show that drugs are connected to over 70 percent of all violent  crime in the United States. This increase in HIDTA funding helps protect  this  country  and  our  communities  against drug dealers and other violent  criminals.  I urge my colleagues to support the  Financial Services appropriations bill.  ",2007

419,Senate,110,0.091,219,2007-06-27,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr President, today I  honor an exceptional small business  from my home State of Maine that is  striving to employ more Mainers and  revive tourism in one of Maine’s hidden  natural treasures. The New England  Outdoors Center of Millinocket  is a  multifaceted  ecotourism  and  recreational sports business and a wonderful example of entrepreneurial spirit in  Maine.  Local  residents  of  the  Millinocket region and tourists, who  come from far and wide to see Maine’s  splendor and beauty, enjoy the Outdoors Center’s diversity of services. In  addition,  the Center’s  owner, Matt  Polstein, is working to add a resort to  his business which would bring additional jobs to the Katahdin region.  The New England Outdoors Center is  an all-season facility that consists of a  snowmobile business, the River Drivers  restaurant, and a white water rafting  enterprise. The Outdoors Center provides a gateway to Baxter State Park  and the spectacular Mount Katahdin,  the Appalachian Trail’s northern terminus. The Center has won numerous  commendations throughout its decades  of operation, including a Maine Tourism award. It is a member of the Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce, the  Maine Tourism Association, the Maine  Snowmobile Association,  and many  other groups. Matt Polstein and the  New England Outdoors Center’s  endeavors greatly benefit the local economy, which has recently been suffering  due to a slump in visitors to Baxter  State Park.  In light of this decline in tourism,  Matt Polstein’s vision of building the  new Ktaadn Resorts  on Hammond  Ridge is particularly critical in bringing people back to the Katahdin region  and to all of Maine. Mr. Polstein’s $65  million proposal evidences his commitment and determination to create new  jobs for Mainers and to contribute to  the growth of Millinocket’s regional  economy. The plan has garnered the  support of the Millinocket community  and its leaders, as well as the unanimous endorsement of Maine’s Land Use  Regulation Commission, which oversees the state’s planning and zoning for  plantations,  townships,  and unorganized areas without local governance.  This  forward-thinking proposal  for a  new resort is one of the largest resort  proposals in Maine’s Unorganized Territory history—a true victory for all  involved. Conscious of  the  environment, Mr. Polstein is seeking to grow  crops and livestock for use at the resort and in the community. The new  Ktaadn Resorts will be an extraordinary  feat when  finished, complete  with a state-of-the-art conference center, a  lodge, rental cabins, and restaurants. The Resort  is expected to  create at least 100 new jobs and to shed  light on Millinocket as a hub of tourism in Maine and New England.  It is vital that we respect our natural  surroundings, and Matt Polstein’s proposal does just that. It is a bright example of the kind of intelligent planning  that benefits Maine’s economy  while protecting the State’s natural  environment. Mount Katahdin  is  a  shining example of what makes Maine  beautiful, and Mr. Polstein’s dedication  to the improvement of his community  exemplifies what makes Maine people  so special. I commend Matt Polstein  for his public service as a city councillor in Millinocket, his current business ventures that provide accommodations and  services  to  tourists year-  round, and for his smart and bright entrepreneurial  savvy with  the  future  Ktaadn Resorts. I wish Mr. Polstein  and everyone at the New England Outdoors Center continued prosperity, and  a successful completion to the Ktaadn  Resorts.∑  f  KEAN UNIVERSITY CHAMPIONS  ∑",2007
420,Senate,110,-0.382,219,2007-06-27,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President, I  wish to pay tribute to the Kean University Cougars baseball team’s dramatic  victory in the 2007 NCAA Division III  National Championships. Bringing joy  to the more than 13,000 Kean University students and all of the Cougar fans  in Union, NJ, Kean University capped  off  their  impressive  season with  a  thrilling 5-to-4 victory in the 10th inning of the championship game. The  victory ushered in the Cougars’ first  baseball championship title and was  the  culmination  of  an  inspiring  undefeated run through the postseason.  Throughout  the  season  the  team  played with courage and determination. Boasting a roster with 28 New  Jerseyans, the Cougars finished in first  place in the New Jersey Athletic Conference, NJAC, with  an  impressive  record of 15 wins and only 3 losses, best  in the conference. Although the Cougars fell to the College of New Jersey  in the conference championships, the  team recovered quickly and  finished  the season with an overall record of 43  wins and  8  losses and  the national  championship.  Championship  baseball  requires  strong leadership, and under coach Neil  Ioviero, the Cougars played team baseball that allowed them to realize their  full potential. With the help of assistant  coaches  Jamie  Ioviero,  Lewis  France, Jack Nagy, Francisco Romero,  and Frank Beckhorn,  the  coaching  staff created a winning environment  and offered the guidance that allowed  the Cougars to excel on the field.  The entire Cougars squad played with  heart and the championship was truly  a team effort. I would like to congratulate and commend all of the players on  the Kean University 2007 Division III  Championship Team: Maikel De La  Rosa, Ryan Clark, Joseph Augustine,  Mike  Shymanski,  Keith  Kwiatek,  Aaron Richard, Joseph D’Andrea, Eric  Ammirata,  Perry  Schatzow,  Chris  Carrano, Thomas Paglione, Brandon  Aich, Mike Manganiello, Kevin O’Neill,  Kyle Murphy, Andrew Cupido, Colin  Feneis,  Matt  Donaghue,  Derek  Gianakas,  Mark  Blevins,  Dan  Mattonelli,  Matt  Grinkevich,  Joe  Rizzo, Tim Lowe, Daniel Zeffiro, Joe  Bartlinski, Matt Merrigan, Nick Nolan  and Nick Cesare.  Mr. President, on behalf of the State  of New Jersey I am honored to congratulate the Cougars for their NCAA  Division  III  Championship  season.  They played hard and displayed an admirable commitment  to competition  and sportsmanship that instills a sense  of pride in the students of Kean University, the team’s fans, and the people of  my State.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO VIC ATIYEH  ∑",2007

422,House,110,-0.448,23,2007-07-10,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 556, the ‘‘Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007’’. As our Nation  pursues the laudable dual goals of free and  fair  flows of capital and  trade  in  the global  economy,  it must remain ever vigilant of  its  own security. Understanding  this, H.R. 556  amends existing law to strengthen the process  by which  the Federal Government performs  national security-related reviews of foreign investments in the United States.  First and  foremost,  this bill establishes  in  statute the membership of the Committee on  Foreign  Investment  in  the United States,  CFIUS. H.R. 556 broadens  the  factors  that  CFIUS must consider during reviews of proposed  foreign  investments  in  the United  States. This includes the bill’s express intent  that critical energy  infrastructure-related aspects of national security not be ignored in the  CFIUS  review  process.  I  am  particularly  pleased with this provision, as well as the establishment in the bill of adding both the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce as permanent members of CFIUS. In  short,  the Committee on Energy and Commerce appreciates  the emphasis  laid by  the  bill on issues that fall squarely within our jurisdiction.  Lastly,  I note my support  for  the bill’s requirement  that  the  Inspector General of  the  Department of  the Treasury  investigate why  that Department has not complied with reporting requirements related to potential industrial  espionage or coordinated strategies by foreign  parties with respect to U.S. critical technology,  as is required under current law. This underscores my strong belief  that Congressional  oversight is a necessary component in assuring that the laws are properly and thoroughly  carried out by the Federal Government.  I do have concerns regarding what I believe  are several shortcomings in H.R. 556, when  compared to the bill originally passed by the  House in February of this year. I am troubled  that  there  is no provision  to designate vice  chairmen of CFIUS—which,  in  the bill originally passed by the House, would have been  comprised of  the Secretaries of Commerce  and Homeland Security—and instead replaces  it with ‘‘lead agencies,’’ to which the responsibility for performing national security reviews  would now mainly be delegated. This has the  lamentable consequence of hindering the thorough participation of the Department of Commerce  in  the CFIUS review process, something  for which my colleagues on  the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce advocated during their hearing  on CFIUS reform in July 2006.  Additionally, H.R. 556 now contains weaker  provisions related to the collection of evidence  in national security reviews,  the approval of  such  reviews, as well as  reporting  requirements to the Congress about them. For example, while H.R. 556 originally directed CFIUS  to submit reports to the Congress on all actions related to covered transactions, the bill  now only provides for reports to be submitted  to  the Congress upon  request. Also,  I am  alarmed that H.R. 556 no longer protects the  Federal Government from liability for losses incurred by parties during CFIUS reviews. Such  an omission may dissuade  the Government  from prosecuting thorough reviews for fear of  being sued  for  remuneration by parties  to  CFIUS-covered transactions.  Although  I have chided  the bill  for what  I  perceive to be its most apparent weaknesses,  I have always maintained that the desire for  perfect  legislation  should  not  impede  the  progress of good  legislation.  I believe H.R.  556 is good legislation that will contribute to  the improvement of the CFIUS. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 556.  ",2007

425,Senate,110,0.381,93,2007-07-10,Mr. MCCAIN.," I paid attention to the  statement of the Senator from Illinois,  as well as that of the Senator from Nevada. We may be approaching—not a  historic moment in the history of the  Senate but certainly one worthy of  note; that is, according to my staff,  that is not always accurate but is well  meaning, we are about, maybe, at least  26 years since we have not had a Defense authorization bill passed by this  body. Clearly from this beginning it appears, as on most other  issues that  have come before this body recently,  we will be gridlocked.  Cloture motions will be filed. Votes  will be taken. Time passes and, unfortunately, during that period of time,  the men and women who are serving in  our military will be without their pay  increase. They will be without the increase in numbers that are called for in  this bill, from 512,000 in the Army to  525,000; from 180,000 in the Marines to  189,000.  The best way, probably, to relieve  the stress on the men and women in  the military and the overdeployment  that, unfortunately, we all regret they  have had to bear, their unfair share of  sacrifice in defense of this Nation and  its security, is to increase the size of  the military. That is in this bill.  Frankly, the reason we arrived at  these numbers is it is just about as  many as can be recruited additionally;  otherwise, I think you would see additional numbers.  Instead of  the  3.5-percent pay  increase, instead of increasing size in the  Army and Marine Corps, which we all  know is badly needed, some of us, including my friend from Michigan, have  known for many years how badly it was  needed. One of  the many mistakes  made by the previous Secretary of Defense was not to call for a dramatic increase in the size of our Marine Corps  and Army, for which our military families have paid a very heavy price.  Here we are, gridlocked in a battle  whether we are going to have 60 votes  and whether we are going to have to  file a cloture motion which will ripen  after a couple of days and all the arcane things that very few Americans  understand. It took me a number of  years to finally comprehend some of  the procedures around here.  So we are, again, going to probably  maintain that historic low in approval  that was recently, in a recent Gallop  Poll that has been taken  for many  years—I have  forgotten  the number  now. I think it was in the teens as the  approval rating of the Congress on the  part of the American people.  Anybody who just watched the proceedings  that went on and  the exchanges between the two leaders make  that disapproval rating far more understandable. The average citizen watching these debates really doesn’t understand why we don’t just go ahead and  take care of the men and women in the  military, to give them the arms and  ammunition they need, to give them  the much needed equipment we have  talked about on this list—the $2.7 billion items on the Army Chief of Staff’s  unfunded requirements list, things like  the $4.1 billion for the MRAP, the Mine  Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles.  We all know how bad the situation is,  as far as IEDs are concerned.  What are we going to do? Are we  going to sit down and say: Hey, you  know what. When the Democrats were  in the minority around here they insisted on 60 votes on just about every  issue, particularly important ones. We  are now insisting on 60 votes, now that  we are in the minority. Yet somewhere  along the way the issue of c-o-m-i-t-y  and the national interest suffers and is  abandoned by the wayside of politics.  The Senator from Michigan and I will  sit here this afternoon and we will have  statements made by various Members  as they come to the floor. There are, if  my past experience with this bill is accurate,  probably  100, maybe more,  amendments that will be pending because there are so many issues that are  important to Members and important  to the defense of this Nation. It is very  likely, from this scenario I am seeing,  that we will for the first time in at  least 26 years not pass a Defense authorization  bill—certainly not  in  a  timely manner. We are already into the  month of July, and, obviously, we will  not spend all 4 weeks on this issue.  I think in days gone by—and we all  have a tendency to remember the good  parts and not the bad parts—there was  a tendency for the managers of the bill  and the majority and whatever party  was in the minority leaders would sit  down and say: OK, we are going to narrow down  the amendments. We are  going to have agreement for a certain  number of amendments and votes, and  it would take us a while. I can remember sometimes it taking 2 weeks. That  is why we usually bump it up against a  recess because one thing in the 20 years  I have been here we have never missed  is a recess. Now we are going to sit  here for this afternoon. It is Tuesday  afternoon, and we are going to have  various statements. Members on both  sides will display their dedication to  the men and women in the military. I  appreciate that. I appreciate the patriotism of every single Member of this  body. But are we really going to do  anything for them? Are we really going  to try to help them? Or are we going to  be locked in combat on an issue that  should not be on this bill?  We probably have taken up the issue  of the war in Iraq eight or nine times.  I don’t know exactly how many times.  We have amendments, we have debates,  we have 60 votes, and then we move on  to something else. Meanwhile, we have  not done a single appropriations bill, I  might add, and we are in the month of  July.  Everybody knows,  even  though  I  don’t happen to agree with it, that September will be a seminal time on the  Iraq issue.  General Petraeus will  be  coming  back, and he will be issuing his report,  which, by the way, I can predict what  it is going to be right now; mixed, some  success and  some  frustration. Then,  guess what, in September, we are going  to go through another debate. We are  going to have amendments, and we are  going to have 60 votes again.  Meanwhile, the American people are  wondering what in the heck we are all  about here, and why in the world, in all  due  respect  to  the deputy majority  leader, do we have to keep taking up  the Iraq issue when we know full well  that  in September  there will be a  major debate on this issue?  Meanwhile, the men and women in  the military who are serving, to whom  I see declaration after declaration of  our dedication and devotion to their  welfare and benefit, then what is going  to equip them? What is going to train  them? What is going to give them the  pay raise? What is going to take care of  them is somehow lost in the rhetoric of  60-vote  requirements,  which  again,  most Americans do not understand nor  should they be required to, because  they expect us to come here and act in  their benefit. Certainly they should be  asking us to act on an issue, on a piece  of legislation such as the Defense authorization bill which has to do with  the defense of this Nation.  Well, I could go on for a long time.  I do not want in any way my comments to be construed as a lack of respect and appreciation for the chairman of the committee, and the many  years we have worked together, because I am convinced he and I could sit  down in a very short period of time and  work out the number of amendments  and  schedule votes and  time agreements. But we are not going to do that.  We are not going to do that. But please  do not come to the floor, I ask my colleagues, and talk about your dedication to the men and women in the military and how difficult it is for them in  these times, when we have before us a  bill to increase the size of the military,  we have before us a bill to give them a  pay increase that they deserve, and it  probably is not going to be passed by  this body, at least before we go out for  the August recess. Then we get into  September. Then we will get into another fight on the issue of whether we  should withdraw troops in Iraq.  I don’t think we should be very proud  of ourselves. I don’t. When the men and  women in the military whom we again,  as I say, all profess our devotion and  dedication to, do not get the equipment  they need authorized, do not get the increases in pay, do not get the increases  in numbers that we are trying to authorize, then do not be too surprised  with the cynicism of the American people and voters and, indeed, the men and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:29 Jul 29, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\S10JY7.REC S10JY 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2007

427,,110,-0.428,1,2007-07-23,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  the front page of the Washington Post  yesterday had the harsh and ugly reality. We cannot afford not to help the  Iraqis who trusted and worked with the  United States with the opportunity for  refugee status.  I quote:  ‘‘The American Ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, has asked the Bush  administration  to  take  the unusual  step of granting immigrant visas to all  Iraqis employed by the United States  Government in Iraq because of growing  concern that they will quit and flee the  country if they cannot be assured of  eventual safe passage to the United  States.’’  For the last 7 months, I have been  working with a broad bipartisan group  of people on legislation that would deal  with the largest ongoing humanitarian  crisis in the world other than Darfur.  And unlike the tragedy in the Darfur  region of the Sudan, the United States  is front and center in Iraq. We have  over 300,000 American soldiers, contractors, and civilian U.S. Government employees. We see firsthand every day the  train wreck, while officials at the top  of the food chain appear, sadly, oblivious and powerless  to do anything  about it.  I am proud to say that there are  young American soldiers who will try  to do something about it, even after  they rotate out of the country. That is  how I  first became  involved  in this  issue, as young Oregonian Guard members fought valiantly to try to save the  life of their interpreter when they returned to Oregon, knowing that her life  was at risk. Working with those young  guardsmen and with high school students  from Lincoln High School  in  Portland, Oregon, we were able to have  a happy resolution in this one case.  But, sadly, it is only one case.  I have become acquainted with another true American hero. Kirk Johnson was a young USAID worker who, as  he rotated out, embarked upon a crusade to save the lives of Iraqis who  were at risk because they were known  to have helped the United States. He  has compiled a list of over 500 Iraqis  who  were  interpreters,  who  were  guides, who were civilian employees.  Not one, the last time I talked to Mr.  Johnson, had been able to make it to  the United States.  The sad fact is that we are failing  miserably in terms of responding to the  refugee requirements. Since I became  involved  last  fall, the United States  has admitted the grand total of 133  Iraqi  refugees,  a  shocking  number  when we consider that over 2 million  Iraqis have fled the country and another 2 million within Iraq have been  displaced  from their homes. It’s not  that we can’t figure out how to do it if  we care, if we establish a priority, if we  work on it. In that same period of time  that we could only admit 133 Iraqis, we  have allowed 3,500 refugees from Iran, a  country with whom we have rocky relations, to say the least, where we have  deep concerns about terrorism.  It makes a mockery of our commitment to accept 7,000 during this fiscal  year which ends September 30. There  must be a sense of urgency and a profound sense of obligation. In order to  make even that modest goal of 7,000,  we are going to have to admit more  Iraqi refugees every working day than  we have for the entire last 9 months.  It is not just the right thing to do for  these poor souls and their  families.  There is a harsh geopolitical reality.  With 4 million Iraqis displaced, more  than half fleeing the country, there’s  1.2 million in Syria, and the accounts  of what these people are forced to do to  keep body and soul together are truly  disturbing. Or three-quarters of a million Iraqi refugees across the border in  Jordan, threatening to overwhelm that  small country, adding another element  of instability to this already unsettled  part of the world.  I urge my colleagues in the House of  Representatives to look at a letter that  we are circulating to them today that  includes this article from the Post. I  urge them to cosponsor our bipartisan  legislation, H.R. 2265, have them urge a  markup and action before we recess for  August. Our failure to keep our commitment will be exceedingly serious.

428,House,110,0.661,22,2007-07-23,Mr. ROYCE.," Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Subcommittee Chairman SHERMAN for his  work on  this  legislation. He worked  this bill  thoroughly, and while we disagree on OPIC’s  merits, he supported my text to reform its investment funds.  OPIC’s investment funds, as some may remember,  have  a  troubled  history.  In  the  1990s, then-OPIC president Ruth Harkin said,  ‘‘If you’re an  investor  in an OPIC-supported  fund, the worst you can do is get your money  back at the need of 10 years.’’ That’s not the  free market OPIC professes  to support and  not surprisingly, these funds were subject to  political cronyism.  There have been reforms  to  the  funds of  late,  including  competitively  selecting  fund  managers, but we should mandate them. My  language does this.  Fundamentally  though,  I  remain  unconvinced  that OPIC  is doing something worthwhile that the private sector wouldn’t do. The  burden of proof should be on OPIC, especially  in  times of accelerating change  in  financial  markets. Several companies have jumped into  the political risk insurance business, for example, offering  increasingly sophisticated products, . . . so why are we reauthorizing government-backed OPIC to continue competing  against them?  We have heard much on  the  floor  trumpeting OPIC’s supposed benefits. However,  most economists believe  that subsidizing  investment—which is what OPIC does—merely  shifts it around, often to lesser productive locations and uses. The Congressional Research Service has reported, ‘‘From the point  of view of the U.S. economy as a whole, there  is  little  theoretical support or empirical evidence  that supports claims  that subsidizing  exports or overseas investment offers a positive net gain  in  jobs  to  the U.S. economy.’’  That’s persuasive evidence against OPIC’s  claims, and its case for reauthorization.  OPIC makes much of the fact that it returns  money to the U.S. Treasury. OK. But let’s consider that this money is held against potential  liabilities stemming from OPIC’s activities. And  give most anybody U.S. government-backing  to trade on, and they’d turn a profit in financial  markets.  One OPIC critic gave a useful description.  Investment  is  like a  rope. Less developed  countries can only pull it in with good policies;  efforts to push in investment, which is OPIC’s  mandate, are bound to be inefficient.  Mr. Speaker, these are some of the reasons  I oppose this legislation reauthorizing OPIC.  ",2007

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of House Resolution  384,  congratulating  the University of Wyoming’s  women’s basketball team for winning  the 2007 NCAA Division I Woman’s National Invitational Tournament Championship.  On March 31, 2007, the University of  Wyoming Cowgirls basketball team defeated the University of Wisconsin by a  score of 72–56 to capture the NIT title  and conclude their most successful season in school history.  Led by  junior Hanna Zaveckz, the  tournament MVP,  and  junior  Jodi  Bolerjack, who scored 16 points in the  championship game, the Cowgirls of  Wyoming truly had a remarkable season in which they compiled a record of  27–9, finishing second in the Mountain  West Conference.  The tournament title capped what  ended up being the most successful season ever for the Cowgirls basketball  team in school history. No Wyoming  Cowgirls team had won as many games.  The previous record was set by the  1978–79 team, which  finished at 25–7,  and no team ever advanced so far in  postseason play.  As the State’s sole 4-year educational  institution, the University of Wyoming  receives strong support from the State  and its residents, making it the perfect  place for a great learning environment.  The university was recently ranked by  the Princeton Review as one of the Nation’s best colleges for 2006, and the  College of Business Department of Economics and Finance was also ranked  10th  in the Nation and 12th  in the  world for its program in resource and  environmental economics.

They  came in, treated every Member of this  body with enormous courtesy and patience, listened to what our requests  were, and then put together a bill that  was bipartisan. It was quite extraordinary. And it was a pleasure to be a  member of the Rules Committee and to  see these two gentlemen come up and  be mutually  complimentary after a  hard process of allocating $50 billion of  taxpayer money for infrastructure and  housing improvement in this country.  They are to be commended for that.  We then come down to the floor and  we get into the back and forth about  specific projects and try to pick and  cherry pick examples of what is bad  when it was the recommendation of the  chairman of the committee that this be  an open rule; so anybody who has got a  problem with any particular project is  going to have an opportunity to offer  amendment to strike that project and  make whatever arguments they want.  This  issue of how we  restore  the  transportation  infrastructure  of  our  country is vital. The fact is we spend  too little, not too much, and it is the  funding  issue that  is a challenge  in  every Congress. But our infrastructure  compared to many of the countries  with which we compete economically is  woefully behind what the economy of  our country needs and the citizens of  our country deserve.  I  applaud  the work  of  this  subcommittee, bipartisan work. And why  it is that we have to beat up on the  work of the committee by claiming it  is partisan, Democrat and Republican,  really escapes me. There  is nothing  partisan about meeting the infrastructure needs of our country. There may  be fierce debates about the best way to  do it, which projects should get funding, how much you allocate towards  the air system versus rail; but the fact  is we have got an obligation to improve  a  crumbling  infrastructure  in  this  country, and the bill that has been presented to this Congress on a bipartisan  basis,  under  the  leadership  of Mr.  OLVERand Mr. KNOLLENBERG, takes us  a solid step forward.

And  I  thank  Chairman OLVER for  doing  a  phenomenal  job on  this bill. And also  Ranking Member  of  Michigan, my sister State, thank you  so very much for your fine work.  To both  these gentlemen,  let me  thank them for their outstanding leadership and for their commitment to investments in America. We see so much  money going abroad,  indeed billions,  hundreds of billions of dollars, and  these gentlemen have done something  for our country, for our fundamental  infrastructure, for transportation, and  for housing, the most  important  investment  any American  has,  their  most important form of savings.  In the transportation area, I want to  just  focus  in one area  important to  Ohio, and that is Amtrak. This bill is  funded at a level of $1.4 billion. And the  funding in this bill is providing critical  capital and operating assistance  to  maintain our national passenger rail  system in a manner that is environmentally  friendly and necessary. No  major industrial country in the world  does not have a modern rail system. We  need a ways to go in order to make  ours better. This bill takes a step in  that direction. Though President Bush  and some of his allies in Congress were  trying to kill passenger rail service in  the country, they cannot succeed, because Amtrak is far too important for  the Nation.  In 2006, more than 24 million passengers traveled on Amtrak. More than  67,000 passengers ride on up to 300 Amtrak trains per day. And just in our  section of Ohio,  57,000  riders make  their way through Toledo, Ohio, as a  part of that. I wish we could do more  for our high-speed rail corridors and for  alternative fuels for the large trains.  That is for the future, but at least we  make investments in the fundamental  system.  Secondly, in the area of housing, I’m  really proud of what the committee has  done, particularly to meet our Nation’s  most essential housing community development programs. Mayors around  this country will appreciate the  increase of nearly $1 billion above the  President’s request for the Community  Development Block Grant program, the  most important program for over 1,180  communities to get some of their tax  dollars back to do what they must to  run their own communities, their own  cities.

435,,110,-0.376,239,2007-07-23,Mr. LANTOS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to recognize the remarkable and heroic acts of  Sir Nicholas Winton, who personally and by  his own initiative saved the lives of 669 Jewish  children  from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia  and brought them across Hitler’s Germany to  his native Great Britain. He is an immensely  compelling symbol of how the caring of one  man can  truly make a difference while confronting evil on a personal  level. Sir Winton  said  it best himself  in a  letter he wrote  in  1939,  ‘‘. . . There  is a difference between  passive goodness and active goodness. The  latter is, in my opinion, the giving of one’s time  and energy in the alleviation of pain and suffering. It entails going out, finding and helping  those who are suffering and in danger and not  merely in leading an exemplary life, in a purely  passive way of doing no wrong.’’  Nicholas Winton was guided by intuition and  character. He understood the upcoming danger and realized the importance of acting fast.  Having made many business trips to Germany  in previous years, Winton saw Jews being arrested, harassed and beaten. Thousands of  Jews  fled  to  as-yet  unoccupied Czechoslovakia, especially  to Prague. Many settled  into refugee camps in appalling conditions in  the midst of winter. Near Prague Winton visited  the  freezing  refugee  camps. His  visit  deeply affected him and he felt the need for  taking action.  He gathered information from parents who  wanted their children out and then pleaded to  countries all over the world to take them in.  He also personally raised the funds to pay for  the operation and  continued his  important  struggle even  though no  countries except  Sweden and the United Kingdom were willing  to take the children in. Further, the media refused to deal with the tragedy about to unfold.  The first 20 of ‘‘Winton’s children’’ left Prague  of March 14, 1939 and Hitler’s troops overran  all of Czechoslovakia  the very next day. By  the time World War II broke out on September  1, 1939, the rescue effort had transported 669  children out of the country.  I commend Nicholas Winton for his courage,  compassion and foresight, for his willingness  to stand up for what he believed was right in  the face of indifference and to accept responsibility for being his brother’s keeper. He has  shown  remarkable  leadership, courage and  ability of taking action when facing evil. Being  a humble man who kept quiet about his heroic  achievements for over 50 years, and without  aspirations of being called a hero, he truly has  shown complete selflessness and devotion to  others. I also congratulate Sir Nicholas’ small  group of volunteers who helped him, not only  for saving hundreds of lives but also for saving  our faith in humanity.  As time goes by, the values for which Sir  Nicholas Winton fought have increasingly penetrated the consciousness of the world. The  children, grandchildren and great-grand children of those he saved will go on to establish  a world where human rights and decency are  the priorities of civilized society.

436,House,110,0.425,152,2007-07-31,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself 1 minute.  First of all, I would like to thank the  majority leader for acknowledging this  bill that we considered today largely  mirrors the Republican legislation on  ethics  from the  last Congress. As  I  mentioned in my opening statement a  few minutes ago, I went through all the  provisions that, in fact, had been carried over from the Republican bill last  year.  But  I would correct  the majority  leader in one respect, and that is many  of the Republican reforms that were included  in our motion  to  recommit  which passed successfully with largely  Democratic support earlier, all of those  Republican reforms were eliminated.  So this bill would have been much improved and much better if all the Republican reforms had, in fact, been included. I regret that was not the case.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 41⁄2minutes to  my friend and my colleague from Georgia (Mr. GINGREY).  ",2007
437,House,110,-0.417,180,2007-07-31,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. FARR).  ",2007
438,House,110,-0.455,180,2007-07-31,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the chairwoman for yielding to me.  I am the only Californian that sits on  the Agriculture Appropriations Committee, and I am very proud that this  bill is in partnership with the progressive new provisions that were adopted  last week in the farm bill. This spends  the money to implement those provisions. As the Chair just said, this bill  takes us in a new direction, a direction  that rural America can be really proud  of.  Many people know California as the  most populous State and think of our  large metropolitan  areas.  But  few  know that California is the number one  ag-producing  State  in  the  United  States. Every one of the 58 counties in  California produces agriculture,  from  the smallest county in San Francisco,  which has nursery and flower stock, to  the most populous  county  in California, Los Angeles County, with row  crops and cattle ranches.  The new leadership in Congress has  taken us in a new direction. That direction is good news for rural America.  That is good news for fresh foods, for  fresh vegetables and fresh fruits to get  into the diet. This bill takes us in a  new direction for consumers. A new direction so that people have choices. A  new direction for green technology to  be used in the energy field. A new direction for conservation to be a part of  good management practices.  I applaud the committee’s new Chair  for taking us in a new direction and  the opportunity for farming in America  to be economically viable. This is good  because  it preserves open space and  preserves the rural character, which is  such a strength of this country.  For California, this is good news. Our  agriculture is like our technology. It’s  changing, always changing. It needs to  be state-of-the-art of technology, of research, of university work. We are the  leaders in organic growing, from wines  to artichokes. I am proud to represent  the part of California that is called the  ‘‘Salad Bowl Capital of the World.’’ The  farmers who implement the best management practices in caring not only  for their farm workers, and there is a  big discussion on that in issues with  immigration, but we have the largest  farm worker force in the United States  and they are now getting paid good  wages. In fact, a lot of them have their  own health care plans, which most  Americans don’t have, and they have  401(k)s for their families and scholarships for their children to go to school.  This  is a new attitude about  farm  workers.  I want  to  thank Congresswoman  DELAURO, the Chair of this committee,  for taking America into a new direction, a more healthy direction.  Let’s reject the reckless amendments  to this bill that undermine the positive  gains made for America. This is a good  appropriations  bill.  I  applaud  the  Chair, Mr. OBEY, for bringing it to the  floor and to the members of the committee, and I urge all my colleagues to  adopt this bill.  ",2007
439,Senate,110,-0.3,222,2007-07-31,Mr. CASEY.," I will not read it, but I  want to highlight some of what he said.  He  talked about  the President and  what has been happening with this debate on children’s health insurance. He  made this point in the second to the  last paragraph:  Treating health insurance for needy children as a political bargaining chip—  And he’s referring to the President’s  other health care ideas——  would be wrong.  He talks about the fact that Mitch  Daniels, who worked in a Republican  administration—he  is  the Governor  now, Governor of Indiana, also a great  supporter of this program. Mr. Dilulio  concludes this way. He says:  For  compassion’s  sake,  the  should compromise on SCHIP . . .  President  And allow this to move forward.  I have to say, some of what we heard  in the last couple of days has been misleading. In the end it is about this: It is  about whether we are going to be fair  to families across America, not whether  the Senate  likes  a  program  or  doesn’t like it. This is about whether  we are going to be fair to families.  Anyone who has had the experience  of being a parent knows when their  child  is born,  that parent, whoever  they are, falls in love again. My wife  and I have four daughters, and we know  that feeling. So many others here do as  well. As a parent, you always want to  love your children and protect them.  When a child is injured or gets sick,  the first instinct of any parent, but especially a mother, is to hug that child,  to dry their tears, and to soothe their  pain  immediately—not months  later,  not days  later, but  immediately. Of  course if it is more serious you want to  get them to a doctor or a hospital.  But for millions of parents—that is  why this bill is so important to get  done—for millions of parents that hug  that they give their son or daughter,  that warm embrace and the comfort  that a hug can bring to a child—that  will often be all that they have at the  end of the road because their son or  daughter has no health insurance, like  the millions of children we have talked  about in the last couple of days. If that  child cries in the dark of night from  pain or if they endure the slow ache of  disease or sickness, the mother cannot  bring the full measure of her love to  that child. In essence, the mother is  rendered powerless because of  that.  Just think of what that does to a  mother and to a family.  When we have debates on this floor  about this bill, none of it matters—  none of the debate in the last couple of  days will have mattered if it does not  result in a total commitment to the  children of America. Unfortunately, if  the President gets his way, we will  have failed that basic test about a full  commitment to our children.  I will conclude with one line. When  my father served as Governor of Pennsylvania, it was one of the first States  to have a children’s health insurance  program. He knew the benefits of it.  His test  for every public official  in  every difficult fight was very simple,  but it is a very tough test: What did  you do when you had the power?  This Senate has the power this week  to tell the President that he is wrong  about children’s health insurance, but  more important to tell America that  we have made a full commitment to  the children of America. If we pass that  test we will have done our job. If this  body does not, it will have failed that  test when we had the power to positively impact millions of children, to  have exercised that power on behalf of  that child, his or her family, and all of  America.  I yield the floor.  ",2007
440,Senate,110,0.453,236,2007-07-31,Mr. BURR.," Mr. President, I rise to  speak on the SCHIP bill. I have an  amendment to the SCHIP bill, but I do  not intend to call it up at this time. I  wish to speak on SCHIP, as well as on  my amendment.  I also take this opportunity to ask  unanimous  consent  to  add Senator  DOLEas a cosponsor to the amendment.  ",2007
441,,110,-0.392,390,2007-07-31,Mr. WEXLER.," Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1, Improving America’s Security Act  of 2007, which includes critical security provisions endorsed by  the 9/11 Commission as  well as an overdue expansion of  the visa  waiver program, VWP.  Mr. Speaker, the visa waiver program is an  immensely valuable program  for  the United  States, and the legislation before us will not  only enable us to expand the visa waiver program  to additional allies who already offer  U.S. citizens visa-free travel to their countries,  but simultaneously strengthen the security aspects of the program.  Although H.R. 1 expands the VWP, I would  have preferred that the program expand to all  the roadmap countries, among them some of  America’s most important and loyal allies, and  I am hopeful Congress will take steps to address this issue in the near future.  Despite my concerns  that some  roadmap  countries may be excluded, this legislation is  an important step towards addressing the security concerns  that members of Congress  have articulated about  the visa waiver program.  I am confident  that once  the security  measures outlined in H.R. 1 are implemented,  those members of Congress who previously  had concerns about the program will be open  to considering  further expansion of  the visa  waiver program.  In  the meantime,  it  is  imperative  that  the  Bush Administration and Congress continue to  work with our allies, who deserve to participate in the program. The United States should  also provide assistance to help these governments reduce their visa refusal rates and meet  all the necessary requirements detailed in the  Improving America’s Security Act.  It is clear that H.R. 1 fulfills key 9/11 Commission  recommendations and  improves  the  security aspects of the visa waiver program,  and I applaud my colleagues for their efforts to  make our country safer and  further expand  this program. However, America cannot successfully fight the battle against international  terrorism without the cooperation and trust of  our allies.  I would  like  to  remind my colleagues  that  the  9/11  Commission  also  stressed the need for diplomacy and cooperation with other Nations to address the threat of  international terrorism. In this vein, further expansion of the visa waiver program can play  a vital role in strengthening America’s relationships and security partnerships with our most  trusted allies—which is essential to preventing  another 9/11 disaster.  f  FARM, NUTRITION, AND  BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007  SPEECHOF  HON.

443,,110,-0.521,397,2007-07-31,Mrs. JONES of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to honor the 75th anniversary of Pierre’s  Ice Cream Shop. Pierre’s Ice Cream Company  was founded in the Cleveland area and has  been a family-owned business since 1932.  Pierre’s founder, Alexander ‘‘Pierre’’ Basset  was the inventor of the original recipe for their  delicious gourmet ice cream. Three quarters of  a century later, Pierre’s Ice Cream Company  continues to uphold a standard of excellence  in customer service and quality products.  It did not take long for Sol Roth, the owner  of  the Cleveland based Royal  Ice Cream  Company to recognize the value, uniqueness,  and potential of Pierre’s Ice Cream Shop. As  time progressed, country clubs,  restaurants,  and other gourmet venues began marketing  Pierre’s brand of ice cream. In 1960, Roth acquired Pierre’s Ice Cream Company and dedicated all of his resources to displaying and expanding its special recipe.  In 1979, Roth requested his daughter Shelley to assist him with the business. In 1991,  Shelley Roth became the president and chief  executive of  the company, overseeing 125  employees, the production, and distribution of  more  than 235 kinds of  ice cream, sherbet,  sorbet, frozen yogurt, and novelties.  In  1995,  Pierre’s  built  a  contemporary  40,000  square  foot distribution  center and  16,000 square foot office headquarters on the  land it originally purchased in Cleveland, Ohio.  Sol  passed  away  in  2005;  however,  his  daughter  Shelley  continues  Pierre’s  outstanding legacy today.  On behalf of the people of the 11th Congressional District, I wish to commend Pierre’s  Ice Cream Company on  their 75th anniversary. Their existence  is a  true  testament  to  family values and dedication, and  the continuing legacy of the American dream.  f  TRIBUTE TO KENNETH MYERS  HON. KENDRICK B.

444,,110,-0.363,397,2007-07-31,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to pay tribute to the late Kenneth Myers,  a fellow Florida Legislator and outstanding attorney in the Miami community.  During Mr. Myers distinguished career in the  Florida House of Representatives and Florida  Senate, he displayed a dedication and commitment to strengthening the state of Florida.  Serving 4 years in the House of Representatives and 12 years in the State Senate, Mr.  Myers sponsored more  than 200 bills  that  strengthened Florida and our sense of social  justice. He personified the essential qualities  of a great community leader and earned his  place among the pillars of our community.  Mr. Myers was  a  brilliant  attorney  and  proudly practiced law with his father for over  thirty years. When his father retired, he joined  another distinguished law firm and continued  with compassion his path  for  justice  in our  South Florida community. Mr. Myers’ sincere  involvement instilled a profound impact on the  community, resulting  in many awards, accolades and honors including a Coconut Grove  park named in his honor.  Mr. Myers lived a stunning life, graduating  from Miami High School in 1950 then pursuing  higher education at  the University of North  Carolina, Chapel Hill. He proceeded  to  the  University of Florida, School of Law. Mr.  Myers’ devotion to education led him to serve  as a member of the prestigious University of  Miami Board of Trustees for 25 years.  Mr. Myers’ is survived by his sister and my  esteemed friend, the Jewish Community Relations Council Director Judy Gilbert-Gould and  her husband, Gerald Gould. He  is also survived by his nieces Nancy Gilbert, Carolyn Gilbert Epstein and Belinda Gilbert; his nephew  Robert C. Gilbert, an officer of  the Greater  Miami Jewish Federation Board; Mark Gilbert,  and eight grandnephews and grandnieces. Mr.  Myers was the son of the Federation’s Founding President, Stanley C. Myers.  His Family and friends will memorialize him  during a special service at Temple Beth Am  on Tuesday July, 31 2007.  Kenneth Myers was a dedicated public servant and his leadership in the community was  genuinely admirable. We would all be well  served to emulate the legacy of achievement  that Mr. Myers practiced  throughout his  lifetime. May his memory be blessed.  f  IN HONOR AND MEMORY OF THE  HON.

",2007
446,,110,-0.321,1,2007-09-05,Mr. WILSON of Ohio.," Madam Speaker, Democrats are taking a new direction in America. We realize that restoring the American Dream begins with a  great education. Unfortunately, over  the last 6 years affording a 4-year college education has become increasingly  difficult,  especially  for  the middle  class. That is why this Congress is providing the single largest investment in  higher education since the creation of  the GI Bill.  We make college more affordable for  all Americans by reducing the cost of  student loans and increasing the size of  Pell Grants, and we do this all with no  new cost to the taxpayers. Our investment in college students would be paid  for by reducing the excessive Federal  subsidies to the student loan industry.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

447,House,110,0.414,22,2007-09-05,Mr. MORAN of Kansas.," Madam  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Georgia for yielding me the time, and I  am here to lend my support for the  gentleman from Kansas’ efforts in regard to once again disaster striking  our State.  We come from a State, Mr. TIAHRT  and I and the rest of the Members of  the Kansas congressional delegation,  that  really has known  tough  times  over a  long history. But especially  within  the  last  few months,  really  within the last year, Kansas has had  winter storms that involved hail and  freezing rain, ice, snow, as well as tornados. Greensburg, Kansas, became a  national  location, known by people  around the world for a tornado that destroyed an entire town, and now most  recently a large portion of our State  has been struck by tremendous rainfall  resulting in flooding.  I appreciate the gentleman from Kansas’ (Mr. TIAHRT) leadership in bringing  attention to this plight that we face in  our State.  In fact, there are 69 counties in the  First Congressional District. All but  four of them have been declared natural disaster areas this year, since January 1 by the President, and FEMA and  other  emergency  responders  are  at  work.  The  encouraging  thing  about  our  State is that local folks respond, and  we’ve seen tremendous efforts by individual citizens from across the State  arriving to help their neighbors, and  we’ve seen the collection plates passed  on  Sunday morning, money  being  raised, response being had, and we’ve  had tremendous support from our law  enforcement  community,  from  our  emergency preparedness officials, as  well as State and Federal officials. In  many instances, I would report that  FEMA has responded in a very noble  and  adequate way,  and we’re  very  grateful for that help.  Again, all the disaster has caused  many Members of Congress to stop and  talk to us from Kansas and wish us  well. We’ve had encouragement and  support from leaders around the world,  in fact, due to the tremendous natural  disasters that have occurred.  And so I’m here to express my support for Mr. TIAHRT’s efforts and let  him know that we all care about the  portion of the State that has now been  affected by these floods and will work  closely with him, following his leadership to see that the response is appropriate  from the Federal Government  and that Kansans once again rebound  from this significant natural disaster.  I, too, would like to commend Coffeyville Resources for their response. It’s  caused  significant  losses within  the  community of Coffeyville. It’s also had  a consequence upon all Kansans. It’s  one of our three refineries, and so gas  and diesel prices have been affected as  a result of the closing, at least temporarily, of a refinery in our State. But  their responses, both in getting back  into business and  their  response  to  being a good corporate citizen within  the community of Coffeyville, should  be recognized.  And finally, I thank the support we  have had from my colleagues here in  the United States House of Representatives. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",2007
448,House,110,-0.267,22,2007-09-05,Mr. MOORE of Kansas.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today in support of H. Res. 544, recognizing the victims of floods in Kansas.  On June 26, a storm brought several days  of torrential rainfall to Kansas, leading to major  damage,  including  the destruction of 3,100  homes and businesses, and even more tragically, one person’s death.  Within a 4 day period, some communities  received 21 inches of rain. Communities in 20  counties were evacuated.  This  resolution simply expresses heartfelt  sympathy for the victims of these devastating  thunderstorms, in addition to conveying gratitude to the local, State, and Federal officials  and  emergency  personnel who  responded  swiftly to the crisis, including the Kansas National Guard and Kansas Highway Patrol and  recognizing  the generous support of volunteers, private and corporate donors, religious  groups, and charitable organizations that have  given generously toward the relief efforts following the destructive flooding.  Most importantly, this resolution commends  the spirit of the people of Kansas, who consistently demonstrate their strength, not only in  rebuilding their own lives in the face of adversity and hardship, but also through their outpouring of compassionate care for neighbors.  ‘‘Ad  astra  per  aspera,’’  is  our Kansas  motto—‘‘to the stars through difficulties.’’  I urge my colleagues  to support H. Res.  544, acknowledging the destruction left behind  by recent severe weather in Kansas, yet celebrating the resilience of the Kansans rebuilding homes, businesses, lives, and dreams.  ",2007

GILLMOR When I think of PAULGILLMOR, I  think of two words,  ‘‘team player.’’  Earlier  this year, when  the Republicans  lost the majority, we had to  downsize the number of Republicans on  the Energy and Commerce Committee,  and I made a decision, as the ranking  member, to try not to have to kick  anybody off the committee and not  bump off our  junior members. So  I  went to the senior members of the  committee and asked if there were any  volunteers who might want to take a  leave of absence to allow the junior  members not to have to be bumped off,  and of course PAULGILLMORwas one of  the ones who volunteered to take a  leave of absence so he could serve on  the Financial Services Committee and  keep his seniority on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.  b1545  Because of that, several of our junior  members were able to stay on the committee.  Well, about a month ago, we had a  contentious mark-up coming up. Sure  enough, one of the junior members had  a personal family situation that they  couldn’t get out of. They were going to  have to take a leave of absence. We  needed every vote. So I went to PAUL,  and I said, ‘‘Would you be willing to  come back on the committee for 1 or 2  days?’’ He kind of grumped a little bit  about it, but he said, ‘‘If you need me,  I’ll be there.’’ Not only did he come  back on the committee, but he offered  amendments and was there all of the  time and didn’t complain, whine, moan  or groan about how tough it was. He  was a team player. He did a good job.  When we were in the majority, PAUL  was the chairman of the Subcommittee  on Environment and Hazardous Materials, which  is not one of the more  glamorous subcommittees of this Congress. It deals with such things as the  Superfund and the Clean Water Act and  all these international treaties. It’s a  tough job. PAULdid it not only with  good grace, but he did it in an excellent  fashion.  PAULGILLMOR is going to be missed  as a friend. He is going to be missed as  a Congressman. He  is going  to be  missed as a statesman for this country.  My sympathy goes out to his wife,  Karen, and his family. We will definitely miss the services of the Honorin the House of  able PAULGILLMOR Representatives.  God bless him, and God bless his family.  ",2007
451,House,110,0.428,64,2007-09-05,Mr. WAMP.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman  for her  service  to  the  Commonwealth of Virginia and to this  great Nation of ours on the Armed  Services Committee and for going and  bringing us that unique insight.  As I prepare to yield to the gentleman  from Georgia,  let me  say  I  think part of the equation for the Congress in a responsible, objective way in  the days ahead is to remember that  this is not all about Iraq. It is about  the  bigger  picture with  the  global  threat of the jihadists, the most radical elements of Islam, and the way  that they are spreading their influence  around the world outside even of the  Middle East. I think we have to really  understand  that  to know what  the  stakes are associated with the precipitous withdrawal or anything that  is  perceived to be a retreat.  These are real problems. It’s easy to  say, oh, George Bush got us into this  war with flawed intelligence. It’s also  easy to forget that over half of the  Democrats in the United States Senate  voted to remove Saddam Hussein by  force and almost half the Democrats in  the House of Representatives voted to  remove Saddam Hussein by force based  on the very same knowledge and understanding that the executive branch had  about what the threats were, and we  made that decision as Americans.  It is really unfortunate today that  decisions and responsibility for those  decisions now end up being peeled off  as partisan  issues  instead of, we do  these  things  together, we  stand  together, we stand behind our troops together, we stand behind their mission  together.  We had Members like RALPHHALLof  Texas come back and say to a person  the men and women in uniform told  him while he was there that we should  stay and finish what we started and not  leave until we can successfully complete this mission. And you say, well,  what is that and when will we know?  Objectively, you’re getting that report  and it’s much more positive than it  was, and the stakes for leaving are incredibly high.  If you don’t believe the influence of  the radical Islamists around the world,  I would encourage you to read Mark  Steyn’s book, ‘‘America Alone,’’ where  he lays out what’s happened in Europe  and  the  influence with  the  global  sharia, which is a call to Islamic law,  and the intimidation and the threat  around the world, or even this new  book called ‘‘Alms for Jihad: Charity  and Terrorism in the Islamic World,’’  by J. Miller Burke. He wrote this book  exposing the connection between the  Saudi  royal  family  and  terrorism  through these charities that they set  up and funnel money.  It reminded me of the Oil-for-Food  scandal at the United States where  Saddam Hussein corrupted the United  Nations.  b1845  All of  the  corruption  that  exists  through  this  radical  effort, because  this book that lays all this out can’t be  bought today. It has vanished from all  of the Amazons. It has vanished from  the availability of Barnes & Noble to  find the book. What happened to it?  Well,  through  intimidation  and  money, they have taken this information out of circulation so the people  can’t see these connections.  They  literally  tie him,  this man,  Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz,  to  the  charity that he set up to  fund bin  Laden with Saudi royal family money,  and  then when  they  published  the  book, it vanished. You can’t get it. You  can’t go buy it.  Mark Steyn lays out, this is the kind  of work that the radical Wahabi sect,  the al Qaeda operatives, are doing in  the world. They have infiltrated and  corrupted, and we are like boiling frogs  if we deny any longer how this threat  is overtaking the free world. America  Alone’s premise is they’ve already got  Europe and frankly Australia is really  the only nation standing with us like  they need to.  This is a growing global imminent  threat. If we pull out, it will rapidly  deteriorate  in the world. Our credibility will be lost for generations. We  may never regain  it. Those are the  stakes. That’s bigger than Iraq. Iraq is  one chapter in this long-term gener-  ational struggle for our freedom. The  sooner we realize it, the better we are.  I went and spoke to kids in schools in  August, and they asked the question  about,  well,  Afghanistan  and  the  Taliban attacked us, but Saddam Hussein in Iraq didn’t attack us. Why did  we go there?  The  lesson of history  is Germany  didn’t attack us,  either. Japan attacked us. Germany didn’t attack us.  But did we ignore the threat of Nazi  Germany? No. Our men stormed the  beaches of Omaha and liberated Normandy and Omaha Beach, and liberated  Europe, so that our way of life could be  DRAKE,  preserved. Sometimes they forget that,  but that’s American leadership. This is  very, very similar to that.  Are we going to exert it in a world in  what this editorial calls the caldron,  you know, of the worst political and religious pathology in the history of the  world in the Middle East? This is the  central stage. We cannot retreat from  this without us really, really taking a  global hit.  The next president is going to inherit  the responsibility of doing this, of carrying this forward.  I want to yield to the statesman from  Georgia, a physician, a healer, a man  with a great heart but a strong back,  also a member of the Armed Services  Committee, Dr. PHILGINGREY.  ",2007

454,,110,-0.385,127,2007-09-05,Mr. KILDEE.," Madam Speaker, today I would  like  to pay  tribute  to  the Greater Coleman  Temple Church of God in Christ as the pastor  and congregation celebrate their 50th anniversary. A celebration will be held on September  9 in Saginaw, Michigan, in recognition of this  momentous occasion. Bishop Roger L. Jones,  pastor of Greater Holy Temple Church of God  in Christ and prelate of the Southeast Michigan Jurisdiction will be the featured speaker  and the theme is ‘‘Celebrating a Glorious Past,  Embracing a Promising Future!’’  Dr. Hurley J. Coleman and Dr. Martha W.  Coleman founded the Greater Coleman Temple on September 7, 1957, under the name of  Johnson Street Mission Church of God  in  Christ. Services were held in the garage attached to Pastor Coleman’s home. Inspired by  God, Pastor Coleman worked to fulfill the vision of building a church. In June 1961, with  less  than  30 members,  a  groundbreaking  ceremony was held and  the Johnson Street  Mission became  the Liberty Park Church of  God in Christ.  The  first mortgage was burned  is 1972  ahead of its maturity date. April 1975 saw the  groundbreaking for Phase II. When that mortgage was paid ahead of schedule, the congregation  looked  to expand and held  the  groundbreaking for Phase III in August 1989.  Blessed with a congregation that continues to  grow, the church has now moved to its third  location at the World Outreach Campus.  In 1997 both Pastor and Mother Coleman  received  their Doctorates  in Ministry. Martha  Coleman  passed  away  on December  14,  1999, and Pastor Coleman was called to the  Lord on  July 2, 2001. Their  son, Superintendent Hurley J. Coleman, Jr., and his wife,  Evangelist Sandra Coleman,  assumed  the  leadership mantle of Greater Coleman Temple  Church of God in Christ and continue to invigorate the congregation.  Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives  to  join me  in  congratulating  Greater Coleman Temple on 50 years of worship, prayer and evangelism. May the clergy,  staff and congregation continue to thrive doing  the work of our Lord, Jesus Christ.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF REVEREND  JOHN J. BRYK  HON. DENNIS J.

I am proud to honor the Wings Over  Houston Airshow because each year  about 70,000 spectators from around the  world gather in the 22nd Congressional  District of Texas to view this historic  Ellington Field  and  view  re-enactments of great battles, see up-close  views of vintage aircraft, and meet yesterday’s and today’s heroes.  For the last 23 years, as you’ve heard,  pilots  from  our Armed Forces and  around the globe wow audiences with  their high-speed acrobatics. And how  often do we get to see real-life daredevils? Well, this weekend, the Canadian  Forces  Snowbirds  will  demonstrate  their  seven-  to nine-plane  close  formations,  tight  turns,  and  head-on passes. Crowds will get to view  state-of-the-art  military  aircraft,  along with planes from days of old.  This year, the air show brings history  to life through authentic World War II  vehicles, equipment and uniforms at a  realistic military camp. They’re going  to re-enact part of the movie, ‘‘Tora!  Tora! Tora!’’ As a former school teacher, I know activities like these help  promote an understanding and appreciation of military history.  Visitors are going to be able to see  trainers,  fighters, and bombers  from  the World War II, Korea and Vietnam  era, and even NASA aircraft. The air  show presents a unique opportunity to  tour some of the largest aircraft in the  world, including the Hurricane Hunter  KC–135 and a C–5 cargo plane, walk  over the wings of vintage airplanes,  and even sit in the pilot’s seat.  Children have  the  opportunity  to  meet flying aces and decorated war heroes and to hear historical recounts  from the people who were there.  This year’s show features both Pearl  Harbor survivors and the Tuskegee Airmen, who were recently awarded the  Congressional Gold Medal. I am proud  of these  folks, and I know that all  Americans are as well. Meeting living  legends and air show performers is inspiring for young and old alike, and  this  show  is a  rare opportunity  to  thank these heroes  for their service  and for their sacrifice.  Wings Over Houston has spent, in the  last 23 years, a quarter of a million dollars to help challenge young people to  go  into aerospace,  engineering, and  aviation. Many go on to careers in the  military and go  to work at NASA  where they can also gain valuable experience as interns at the Johnson Space  Center, which is across the street from  Ellington Field. With  its  important  contributions, Wings Over Houston ensures that our Nation leads the way in  math and science.  The air show has also donated proceeds  to various  local and national  charities throughout the years, including  the Texas Southern University  Aviation Career Academy,  the Exchange Club of Sugar Land, and the  Commemorative Air Force aircraft restoration  and  flying  historical  programs. Together with their partner,  Wings Over Houston,  it has greatly  contributed  to  the  economy  and  growth of southeast Texas.  So I want to thank the members of  the House Armed Services Committee,  and many of my Texas colleagues, particularly,  for  their cosponsorship of  this resolution. I am pleased to honor  the Wings Over Houston Airshow as a  leader in the history and the future in  the United States Armed Forces.  ",2007

462,Senate,110,0.434,73,2007-10-01,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to pay tribute to Mayer Mitchell, a great American and human being  who passed away on Wednesday, September 26, 2007. A highly successful  businessman and  remarkable philanthropist, Mayer Mitchell was a personal friend, and along with the entire  city of Mobile, I mourn his passing.  Mayer was born in New Orleans in  1933 and grew up in Mobile, AL. He  earned his bachelor of science degree in  economics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance  in 1953. He then served as an Army first  lieutenant  in Korea, earning a commendation ribbon with medal pendant  for meritorious service.  Returning home to Mobile with his  wife Arlene  in 1958, Mayer  founded,  with his brother Abe,  the Mitchell  Company, a commercial and residential real estate development firm. He  went on to serve as its chairman and  chief executive officer  for  the next  three decades, selling his interest in  the Mitchell Company in 1986.  The company’s final total under the  oversight of the Mitchell brothers was  remarkable, with 25,000 single family  homes, 20,000 apartments and 175 shopping  centers  built  throughout  the  Southeast.  In fact, the current Mitchell Company that descended from a partnership of Mayer and his brother remains  the largest private firm in Mobile and  is  among  the  top  40  in Alabama.  Mayer’s business success earned him an  induction into the Alabama Business  Hall of Fame in 2006.  Mayer Mitchell  leaves a  legacy of  tremendous philanthropy, touching the  lives of many residents of south Alabama. Mayer was a tireless proponent  of education and health care, serving  more than 32 years on the University of  South Alabama’s Board of Trustees, including a term as chairman.  He was awarded the University of  South Alabama’s National Alumni Association Distinguished Service Award  in 2005 and an honorary doctorate of  humane letters in 2007.  The Mitchell  family’s philanthropy  reached all aspects of the campus at  the University of South Alabama, from  business and medicine  to athletics.  Mayer will forever be remembered as a  legendary figure in the growth of the  University. The Mitchell Cancer Institute, the Mitchell College of Business  and the Mitchell Center sports and performance complex, proudly bear the  family name.  To date, the Mitchell family holds  the distinction of having contributed  more than any other single family to a  public university in Alabama State history.  The Mitchell Cancer Institute alone  is a powerful legacy, providing state-  of-the-art  cancer  care  to  people  throughout  the  gulf  coast  region.  Mayer always explained his deep commitment to cancer treatment through  a personal connection. At the age of 36,  he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease and was given 6 months to live.  After  2 years of  treatments, Mayer  made an extraordinary recovery.  This victory not only shaped his life,  but shaped the future of the Mobile region as well. He never forgot that he  had to leave Mobile for his own cancer  treatment  in Rochester, NY, and he  vowed to make certain Mobile had its  own cancer center in the future.  This experience shaped his generosity  and will to persevere in the form of improved quality of health care for every  resident in south Alabama.  Although Mayer Mitchell and his  family were critical to the tremendous  growth of the University of South Alabama, this was not the only object of  Mayer’s patronage.  A strong friend to Israel, he served a  term as president of  the American  Israeli Public Affairs Committee and  served on the board of the Washington  Institute for Near East Policy and the  Jewish Seminary of America, which  awarded him an honorary doctorate.  Mayer  supported  several  other  schools and numerous social and religious organizations. His philanthropic  service  included work with Alabama  Power  Company,  Wright  School,  Bishop State Community College, Leukemia Society of America, USA Foundation, AmSouth Bank, Altus Bank,  Mobile Area United Way, Mobile Area  Chamber of Commerce, Mobile Jewish  Welfare Fund, Mobile Federation of  Jewish Charities, Mobile County Real  Estate Association, Archives of American Art, Anti-Defamation League and  the Banc Corporation.  His honors include: Jewish Welfare  Fund Man of the Year, Outstanding  Young Men of America, Prichard Honorary Citizen of the Year, Mobile County Realtor of the Year, and numerous  high honors from the Boy’s Club of Mobile, Bishop State Community College,  University of Rochester, New Orleans  Chapter of Hadassah, Alabama Institute  for the Deaf and Blind, Mobile  Kiwanis Club and the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association.  Mayer is loved and will be missed by  his wife of 54 years, Arlene; his son  Richard; his three daughters, Melinda  Wertheim,  Joy Grodnick  and Lisa  Bukstein; and eight grandchildren.  He was an inspiration to many and  will be remembered for his dedication  and many contributions to Mobile and  the University of South Alabama.  I ask the entire Senate to join me in  recognizing and honoring the  life of  Mayer Mitchell.  ",2007

For  years,  the United Nations  has  attempted to reduce the potential  for  conflict on Cyprus and to heal and reunify that long-divided island.  Last year, Under Secretary of the  United Nations Ibrahim Gambari potentially made progress towards resolving this issue. Thanks to his efforts,  the Greek and Turkish Cypriots signed  an agreement on July 8, 2006, that sets  out principles forming the basis for a  future permanent agreement.  Mr. Speaker, these important principles include, first and foremost, recognition that the status quo, with a divided island, is unacceptable. They also  include a commitment to unification  based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation; a commitment to form intercommunal working groups aimed at achieving  confidence-building measures  to  improve daily lives on both sides of the  island; and a commitment to promote a  positive atmosphere that would allow  negotiations to thrive.  All of us hope that the July 8, 2006,  agreement between the Greek and the  Turkish  Cypriot  communities  will  prove to be an important step on the  road to reunification of Cyprus as a bizonal,  bicommunal  federation.  The  pace of the progress must accelerate.  To date, it has been, at best, halting.  But both parties have at least renewed  their pledge to work towards a negotiated agreement.  Mr. Speaker, U.N. Security Council  Resolution 1758 expresses full support  for the July 8, 2006, agreement. I hope  the Members of this body will reinforce  that message by backing this bill, and  thereby backing the unification of Cyprus. The resolution before us, H. Res.  405, expresses its support for the immediate  implementation of the July 8,  2006, agreement, and it calls on the administration to support it as well.  b1700  Mr. Speaker, the people of Cyprus deserve our encouragement and our support in their efforts to prepare for new  talks aimed at reunification, and that  is exactly what this resolution seeks to  do. I strongly support it, and I encourage my colleagues to do likewise.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

During her time in Congress, JOANNwas a  strong advocate  for her constituents and an  active voice on issues affecting the Commonwealth.  As Ranking Member of  the House Armed  Services Readiness Subcommittee, JO ANN  was well-positioned and a successful advocate  for her district’s economic bread and butter—  the shipbuilding and national defense industry.  Regarding our joint efforts to grant federal  recognition  to Virginia’s six state-recognized  tribes, JOANNwas a passionate and helpful  ally. Her familiarity with the tribes’ issues and  her testament as to their traditional values and  practices helped pave the way for the recognition bill’s passage in the House. I am grateful  that, despite her failing health, she lived to see  the bill receive the unanimous support of her  colleagues.  JOANNwill be deeply missed both within  Congress and  the Virginia delegation. Our  hearts and prayers go out  to her husband  Chuck Davis, her two sons, and their entire  extended family as they cope with the loss of  their beloved wife, mother and citizen  legislator.  ",2007

I would like to share with my colleagues a pressing health concern facing  the  American  public—COPD.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  or COPD, is a growing public health  threat  in America.  It  is the  fourth  leading cause of death in the U.S. and  is a major source of serious long-term  disability.  COPD  kills more  than  120,000 Americans each year—an average of one every 4 minutes.  Despite these alarming statistics, the  United States does not have a coordinated approach to tracking COPD morbidity and mortality  trends,  identifying people at risk for COPD and ensuring they are evaluated by their physicians, and educating the public about  the causes and symptoms of COPD.  ",2007
472,,110,0.633,107,2007-10-22,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Madam Speaker, on  behalf of the United States Congress, it is with  great honor that I rise today in recognition of  Helen Spencer, who for the last 40 years has  engaged  in committed, dutiful service  to  the  City of Fort Walton Beach, FL, as  the City  Clerk.  Helen Spencer’s  dedication  to  the City  began in 1967 when she became a secretary  in the Fort Walton Beach Police Department.  In 1970, she was promoted to stenographer.  In 1974 and for the next 7 years she was a  high  level secretary, and on April 29, 1981,  she was promoted to Executive Secretary for  the Fort Walton Beach Police Department.  When the position of City Clerk of Fort Walton  Beach was vacated she was quickly chosen to  fill the spot as interim city clerk. After only a  few months of service  to  the City,  the City  Council asked her to fill the position permanently.  As the city clerk, Mrs. Spencer manages a  multitude of functions. She oversees the official City records, prepares City elections, manages  the city’s  leases and deeds, and prepares countless minutes and agenda packages  for  the City Council. However, Mrs.  Spencer’s dedication to the community ranges  beyond her occupation. She participates on  the Local Issues Committee, the Greater Fort  Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce, and  serves as vice president of the Sugar Beach  Sertoma Club.  Madam Speaker, on behalf of  the United  States Congress,  I am proud  to  recognize  Helen Spencer on her 40th anniversary with  the City of Fort Walton Beach, FL. Mrs. Spencer  truly possesses an extraordinary understanding and a unique perspective of  the  City’s history. She is a committed, innovative,  and loyal resident of Fort Walton Beach, and  we are forever grateful for her service.  f  INTRODUCTION OF BILL ON PROTECTING CONSUMERS THROUGH  THE  PROPER  FORBEARANCE  PROCEDURES ACT OF 2007  HON.

473,,110,-0.515,114,2007-10-22,Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the nomination of Leslie Southwick,  now being considered by the U.S. Senate.  In an attempt, yet again, to place someone  for a lifetime seat on the Federal bench, which  has traditionally been racially ignorant and insensitive towards civil rights, the President has  risen  to  the occasion and nominated Leslie  Southwick.  This will be his third nomination, of a Mississippian,  to  the Fifth Circuit since 2001.  However, none of his nominations aid in rectifying the egregious problem with the lack of  diversity on Mississippi’s Federal bench.  Mississippi has  the highest African-American population, 37 percent, of any state in the  country. In spite of the hundreds of African-  American  lawyers and  judges  in Mississippi,  there has never been an African-American,  nor any other minority  from Mississippi, appointed  to represent Mississippi on  the Fifth  Circuit Court of Appeals in the history of this  country.  This is a fight worth having. The Fifth Circuit  has  the highest percentage of minority residents of any circuit. At the same time, its civil  rights jurisprudence is far to the right. The recent events in Jena, LA, show the racism in  the criminal justice system within the jurisdiction of  the Fifth Circuit. We cannot afford a  nominee hostile to civil rights on this or any  other Court.  There is a history with this seat. The President is intent on placing someone hostile to  civil  rights  in  the Mississippi seat on  this  Court. Charles Pickering and Michael Wallace  were nominated but couldn’t get confirmed because of their civil rights records. This is the  third try by the Administration, and the pattern  is very clear.  Instead of stepping up  to  the plate and  nominating someone capable of delivering fair  and  impartial decisions on civil  rights,  the  President has slapped Mississippians  in  the  face with the recent nomination of Southwick.  Just  look  to Southwick’s controversial opinions.  In Richmond v. MS Dep’t of Human Services, a white employee was fired for using the  phrase ‘‘good ole nigger’’ toward an African-  American  co-worker. When  the white employee was fired, a hearing officer reinstated  the employee. In upholding the reinstatement,  the majority  (which Southwick  joined) concluded that using the phrase ‘‘good ole nigger’’  was equivalent to calling the other employee  her ‘‘teacher’s pet.’’ This opinion was unanimously reversed by the Mississippi Supreme  Court. And this is Bush’s No. 1 draft pick?  Southwick’s rulings on race discrimination in  jury selections are equally disturbing. In such  cases there is a noticeable pattern of prejudice. Southwick upheld claims  that  the defense struck white jurors on the basis of their  race while rejecting claims that the prosecution was racially motivated in striking African-  American jurors. On one hand, Southwick allows prosecutors to strike African-American jurors when  the motivation  is  clearly  racial,  McWilliams v. Mississippi, or when the prosecution cites non-racial reasons for the strikes,  Davis v. Mississippi. Yet, Southwick denies  the defenses warranted attempts  to  strike  white jurors even when the defense uses the  same non-racial reasons for the strikes, Webb  v. Mississippi. And this is the President’s No.  1 draft pick?  The aforementioned cases exemplify several opportunities Southwick has had to make  a judicious decision befitting such a high court  but failed to do so.  Such views must not be tolerated or encouraged through a nomination to a lifelong post  representing the judicial integrity of our nation.  By  this nomination,  the Administration  is attempting  to  reward  judicious  incompetence  and great shortsightedness toward civil rights  issues.  It’s almost as if the President believes that  Mississippi does not have any competent African-American  lawyers. To  think  that a state  overflowing with highly capable African-American attorneys cannot fill this Mississippi seat  is simply preposterous.  Again,  I express my sincere opposition  to  the nomination of Leslie Southwick  to Mississippi’s Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mississippi needs a nominee who will not look to  discourage or impede its growth, but instead,  support and empower Mississippi’s legacy.  f  TRIBUTE TO HERBERT  HENDERSON  HON. NICK J.

474,House,110,-0.347,3,2007-10-31,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Madam Speaker,  the Children’s Health Insurance Program is one of the most effective government programs of the last decade.  For an investment of just $3.50 a day,  we can ensure health care  for that  child who would otherwise fall through  the cracks because their family makes  too much for Medicaid but can’t afford  private health insurance.  This small cost is significantly less  than the cost we all bear when uninsured children fail to receive preventative care and end up in our emergency  rooms. Yet the President and about 10  of his Republican House supporters are  all that stand in the way of covering 10  million American children.  Our bipartisan legislation will allow  children who are already eligible for  the program to see the doctor of their  family’s choice so they don’t have to  resort to an emergency room for their  primary care.  Madam Speaker, it is time for our  Republican colleagues in this body to  join us in ensuring that all American  children have a healthy start in life.  The future success of our Nation depends on the health and well-being of  our children. It is time for the obstructionists to get out of the way. Let’s get  the job done.

475,Senate,110,-0.144,164,2007-10-31,Mrs. MCCASKILL.," Mr. President, if  the Senator would yield for a second,  as he well knows, I voted with him. I  voted with the Senator from Oklahoma  to try to pull some of the earmarks out  of the bill, to pull all of that money  out of children’s health  insurance. I  think he and I both agree on the goal.  The problem is, the question I wanted to ask—and he is not in a position to  answer it because, unfortunately, he is  not someone who was here who voted  for Medicare Part D, but the inconsistency as to what I hear from the White  House and what I think people in this  Chamber are hearing from the Senators  who voted  for Medicare Part D  is,  every argument  they are using  for  SCHIP is true but exponentially higher  in Medicare Part D.  By the way, the only difference is in  Medicare Part D the people who are  making the money are the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance  companies, and it is not funded and  multimillionaires and billionaires get  it. So it is so unfair to say that the  President is taking a principled stand  because if it were a principle, it would  have been consistent for both SCHIP  and Medicare Part D. That is the question that you are unable to answer, and  I have yet to hear anybody answer that  question.  ",2007

Veterans groups from around the Nation have made it clear it is wrong and  cynical to use their bill for political  purposes.

For  those  States currently with a program  in  place, the manager’s amendment says  all of these mitigation components are  excellent, but we are going to give you  5 years to get your act together.  My suggestion would be let’s shorten  that up. Let’s make it 2 years, and I  think that is still very gracious, to follow on the word of grace.

He has been a great  partner in the effort to put this bill together. I am pleased the Senate separated the Military Construction-Veterans bill from this conference report.  With respect to the Labor-HHS bill  before us, it is a good bill and a fair  compromise. It makes needed investment in our Nation’s health care, infrastructure, supports our country’s workforce and increases educational opportunity for America’s kids. I intend to  support it.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

On December 8, 2007, Mrs. Kidd  will celebrate her 103rd birthday. Many family  members and friends will recognize this momentous occasion with a party in late November.  Maggie was born during President Theodore  Roosevelt’s second  term  in office and has  lived to see another 16 presidents in her lifetime. Maggie Brown was  the eleventh and  youngest child born to William (Doc) and Lucy  Callahan. She is the sister of Johnny (John S.)  Brown, Rosie May Brown, Pearlie Docia Ann  Brown  Seals,  Jasper  Brown,  Sally Mack  Brown Finch, Evie Brown Robinson, Lena  Jane Brown Jewell, Mary Lou Brown, Jewell  McNabb, Nora May Brown Barrow, Climmie  Lee Brown Finch Haynes and James Richard  (J.C.) Brown.  At a young age, Maggie united with  the  Mount Zion Baptist Church in Stephens, Georgia under  the  leadership of Reverend W.M.  Combs, and was baptized by Reverend Henry  Gresham. After church, she  loved  to play  baseball on Sunday afternoons with her siblings. She remained with Mt. Zion until she  moved to Atlanta, and still feels a connection  to her home church.  On November 30, 1940, she married Willie  (Dock) Kidd,  III, son of Willie Kidd,  II and  Annie Lou Dalton, and brother of Bernice Kidd  Wingfield, Ceola Kidd Jackson, Janie Kidd  Jackson and Carrie Kidd Thomas. Mr. and  Mrs. Kidd  raised  two  children,  John  and  Rosalyn. She is also a grandmother to four,  and a great-grandmother to three children. As  her husband and all siblings have passed  away, Maggie is the matriarch of her family.  Maggie still  takes  long vacation  trips with  her children and participates  in  family gatherings  and  activities  outside  of Georgia.  Maggie is an avid quilter and enjoys a quiet  afternoon stitching in her favorite chair.  In closing, Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life of  Mrs. Maggie Katie Brown Kidd, by wishing her  a very happy 103rd birthday.  f  LANTOS  RECOGNIZES  YAD  VASHEM  CEREMONY HONORING  ALBANIANS WHO SAVED JEWISH  LIVES DURING THE HOLOCAUST  HON.

493,,110,-0.429,260,2007-11-08,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to pay  tribute  to James Klurfeld, vice  president  and  editorial  page  editor  of  Newsday, who last week retired after nearly  40 years of outstanding and tireless work at  the paper.  James Klurfeld was born  in 1945  in New  York City and is a 1963 graduate of Syosset  High School. His illustrious career at Newsday  began in 1968, just one year after he graduated from Syracuse University.  Klurfeld’s  first  job at Newsday was as a  local reporter, where he covered various news  stories on Long  Island. But he quickly rose  through the ranks at the paper, where his extraordinary reporting propelled him into several  key positions. He led Newsday’s Albany bureau, and he  served as  the newspaper’s  Washington bureau chief between 1980 and  1986. After his exceptional leadership during  these stints, Klurfeld was appointed editor of  the editorial pages in December 1987.  James Klurfeld’s constant pursuit of journalistic excellence has earned him numerous  honors and recognitions. He was a member of  the Newsday investigative team that won the  1970 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, as well  as the New York State Publisher’s Association  and Deadline Club award  in  the same category. The awards were  for a 3-year effort  that disclosed political corruption  in several  townships on Long  Island. He also won  the  Sigma Delta Chi National Reporting Award  with other members of the Washington bureau  in 1982, and he was the recipient of the 1988  American Society of Newspaper Editors Distinguished Writing Award  for editorials on  the  Iran-Contra hearings. In addition, the staff of  Newsday’s editorial and viewpoints pages won  several major awards under his  leadership.  These included everything from brilliantly written editorials  to exceptionally creative cartoons.  Over the years, Klurfeld has become incredibly knowledgeable about  local and national  issues and is an expert on foreign affairs matters, most notably through his extensive travels around the globe and from his work with  the Council on Foreign Relations.

496,,110,0.348,87,2007-11-16,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to pay tribute to one of the most  outstanding individuals I have come to know in  my 30 years in Congress, Dr. James Slater of  Loma Linda University Medical Center, who pioneered the development of the proton beam  cancer therapy.  When Loma Linda University Medical Center in my district recruited Dr. James Slater to  develop a radiation oncology program in 1970,  they gained a unique expert in the field of radiation  therapy. Before he became a physician, Dr. Slater’s main  interest was physics.  With a profound understanding of the way radiation works on the human body, Dr. Slater  set out to find a way to gain more control of  the process and reduce the toll this therapy  takes on patients.  He became convinced after nearly 15 years  of research that the best way to accomplish  this was  through proton beams, which had  been tested in research laboratories but never  developed as a permanent medical  therapy.  After meeting with scientists and physicians  from around the world, Dr. Slater began looking for a partner to develop the technology for  a proton-beam treatment center. When private  industry declined  to  take  the challenge, he  turned to Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) near Chicago, which had been  actively involved in research on the potential  for medical technology. In 1986, the medical  center and Fermilab—backed by the Department of Energy—agreed  to build a proton-  beam treatment center at Loma Linda.  One of the most marvelous experiences I’ve  had as a member of Congress came in 1987,  when Dr. Slater and his team came to my office to lay out the plan for a new way of treating cancer  tumors.  I was quickly convinced  that his idea was fabulous, and his ability to  bring together the medical, technical and operational experts was superb. During a hearing  before the House Energy Appropriations Subcommittee, my  colleagues  agreed. Many  members had family or close friends who had  been afflicted with cancer, and  they were  eager to help find a new treatment plan. Major  funding was approved and the center opened  in 1990.  Thanks to the dedication of the medical center and the support of Congress and Department of Energy, Dr. Slater’s vision has become a reality in the past 20 years. More than  11,500 patients have  received  treatment  for  prostate cancer, brain tumors, and other forms  of cancer. A research program  is promising  new ways  to  treat breast cancer early and  possibly avoid mastectomies in many cases.  Another program has helped the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  research  the effects of space radiation and design better equipment for astronauts. Since 2003, four  more  proton-beam  treatment  centers  have  opened in other areas of the country.  Madam Speaker, I am delighted to tell my  colleagues that Loma Linda University Medical  Center has decided to honor this pioneering  medical scientist by naming the proton beam  treatment center  in his honor. There  is no  doubt that this honor is richly deserved, and  memorializes a true visionary and benefactor  for thousands of cancer patients in the future.  Please join me in congratulating Dr. Slater on  receiving this honor, and thanking him for his  dedication to opening new horizons in the fight  against cancer.  f  TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT FIRST  CLASS DAVID A.

497,Senate,110,-0.173,27,2007-12-10,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. President, today I  celebrate the tenure of Wesley College  president Dr. Scott D. Miller. After 10  years as president, Dr. Miller will step  down to assume leadership of Bethany  College in my home State of West Virginia in January 2008.  Founded in 1873, Wesley College is located on 50 acres in historic Dover, DE.  Delaware’s oldest private college, the  school offers 30 bachelors and 4 associates degrees, and master’s degrees in  nursing, education, business administration and environmental science.  I first met Dr. Miller in 1997 when I  was Governor of Delaware, and he was  appointed as the 15th president of Wesley College. During his tenure, the college proudly reported record applications, a climbing enrollment, increased  alumni participation and a greater minority presence. For these and other  accomplishments, Dr. Miller has been  nationally acclaimed for his contributions to higher education.  Under Dr. Miller’s leadership, Wesley  experienced substantial growth, including  total enrollment  increases  from  1,052 to 3,210 and $67 million raised in  the Campaign  for Wesley  fund, with  more than $40 million earmarked for  capital renovations and new construction. Dr. Miller oversaw the creation of  four graduate programs and the establishment of a New Castle County campus for Adult Studies. In addition, he  established an undergraduate nursing  program and  five other new undergraduate majors.  Beyond academics, Wesley College  has also been granted membership in  the  selective Capital Athletic Conference and enjoys the addition of new  varsity sports programs. Congratulations to the Wolverines who are again  in the quarterfinals this year for the  NCAA Division III South Region collegiate football championship.  To maintain Wesley’s support of the  local community, Dr. Miller was also  instrumental  in building an alliance  with Delaware State University and  the Friends of the Capital Theater to  maximize  the usage of  the historic  Capital Theater, positioning it as the  premiere  performing  arts  center  in  southern Delaware. The  relationship  was formalized in January 2007 with  the three organizations becoming equal  partners in the operation, management  and programming of the theater.  In addition to all the accolades already mentioned, Scott and his family  have become valued  friends of mine  and of many others in Delaware over  the past decade. Dr. Miller’s wife Ann  is an educator in her own right and has  been a full partner with her husband in  supporting his efforts to lead Wesley to  new heights. We were also  lucky to  have their daughter Ashlee serve as an  intern  in my Wilmington office this  past summer.  Scott and Wesley College have also  supported my charter school initiative  in Delaware by being one of the first  colleges in America to charter and provide space for a public charter school.  Additionally, Wesley College was one  of the first institutions to sign on as a  partner of a homeownership initiative  that I started in Dover by supporting  the effort to increase homeownership  rates  in  the capital city.
