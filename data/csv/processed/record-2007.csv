0,9,2007-01-05,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to engage in colloquy  with my friend. I wonder if the gentleman has had an opportunity to look  at what we consider to be the opening-  day rules package that we are considering.  He has talked about, Mr. Speaker,  some very important provisions. I believe  that  the  24-hour  layover  idea  which was propounded by the then-  Members of the minority is an important one. It is not guaranteed here; so  it is not provided.  Number two, if you look at title V of  the measure that is before us, title V  provides 5 minutes of debate on five  closed rules. The Rules Committee will  not even be giving the minority the opportunity to have its amendments defeated in the Rules Committee, and we  are not going through the committee  process at all.  Now,  I will acknowledge that the  items that we are going to be addressing, a majority of which I support, are  very important for us to proceed with,  and an argument has been made that  this was debated and discussed in the  last Congress. Well, look at the tremendous number of new Members of  the House that have come  in, especially on the majority side. They are  denied any opportunity to participate  in this process at all. So as I hear my  friend talk about, yes, we need to proceed in a civil manner, and I am all for  that, I believe we need to proceed with  fairness. I believe these things are all  very important. It is just unfortunate  that the facts are not reflected in the  rhetoric that we are getting on the  need for civility and openness and debate.  If my friend would like to respond, I  would be happy to yield to him.  ",2007
1,9,2007-01-05,Mr. BAIRD.," Mr. Speaker, I would be  happy to respond. And let me say I acknowledge  the  gentleman’s  concern  and I share it to a significant degree.  Personally, I would prefer that there  had been more time and more opportunity  for debate  in  some of  these  measures and more opportunity  for  input from the minority side.  ",2007
2,9,2007-01-05,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate that.  b1030  What I would say is that based on the  fact that we have never before, in the  230-year history of this republic, we  have  never  had  the  greatest  body  known to man come forward with five  closed rules in an opening day package  denying Members an opportunity to  participate in any way.  So that is why I would argue this notion that we are beginning with a new  tone, we are going to have an openness  and all,  is,  in  fact, not reflected  in  what we are  facing  in the next  few  days.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
3,9,2007-01-05,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 30  seconds to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. BAIRD).  ",2007
4,9,2007-01-05,Mr. BAIRD.," I appreciate the gentleman’s point. I would just echo the sentiments of the gentleman  from New  York earlier.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us  in these early opening days of this session is legislation that has been debated extensively and been available  extensively over  the past couple of  months, indeed, some of it was passed  in the last Congress. I would suggest  that we have had time to look at this.  I would concur, and I will say that in  the future, when future measures come  up, especially measures that are new to  this body, I will work very vigorously  to ensure that the minority has adequate time to study, to debate and  offer amendments to that legislation.  ",2007
5,9,2007-01-05,Mr. DREIER.," Let me just respond. I  know his time has expired.  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to respond.  We haven’t seen any of the items.  Maybe you all have those items, but we  have not seen those items that we will  be voting on. They haven’t been submitted to us at all.  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 21⁄2  minutes to my very good friend from  Iowa (Mr. KING).  ",2007
6,9,2007-01-05,Mr. KING of Iowa.," I thank the gentleman for yielding. I do have to speak  up for Iowa, although I wish Iowa was  playing in the national championships  coming up.  Mr. Speaker, not long ago, Members  and  leaders of the current majority  party of  the House  spent countless  hours attempting to draw the attention of the American people to what  they defined as a culture of corruption  here in Congress. Hoping to use this,  they wanted to turn this phrase, usher  in a new Democratic majority. That  was their wish on election night that  Members of the new majority stood in  this Chamber prior to that, and on numerous soap boxes across the country  and promised that if the American people gave them the chance to run things  here on Capitol Hill, they would do  things differently.  Mr. Speaker,  I agree  that  things  should be done differently here in this  body. Last year in the 109th Congress,  I  introduced H.R. 4967, the Sunlight  Act, and that was of 2006. This bill  would have, on a number of things, required that bills, conference reports,  joint resolutions and amendments be  available to the public on the Internet  in a searchable  format before a bill  could be voted on.  It also would have required and will  require,  if  passed,  privately  funded  travel be approved in advance by the  Rules Committee with the costs being  fully disclosed in 5 days. It would require that Members report exact assets  and liability values on their financial  disclosures  instead of vague  ranges,  vague ranges that allow a Member to  report between $5 million and $25 million  in assets. That  is too broad a  range.  A $20 million range would require the  subject of debate to be projected on the  wall so it is visible to Members and  people that are in the gallery. It would  require  that  donations  to  political  campaigns be reported in a searchable,  sortable  format on the Internet and  have that within the last 30 days each  day, within each 24 hours a report be  filed.  I believe that passage of my Sunlight  Act would do much to raise the levels  of transparency in the affairs of this  body, and  it would also restore the  public’s confidence in our Members. It  is disingenuous for the majority claim  that they want to change things when  they don’t want to give a consideration  of  commonsense  reforms  like  those  outlined in this bill.  Yet this bill, as I worked it hard last  year, could not earn one  signature  from a single Democrat as a co-sponsor. Now, I am refused the opportunity  to even offer this as a bill. This is my  only opportunity to even make the argument.  So I would make this argument, Mr.  Speaker, that there were a lot of campaign promises  that were made.  It  seems to me that the one that is the  most obstructive to all of us is the  promise to accomplish this series of  things in the first 100 hours. The first  100 hours has been redefined. Many of  these promises will be also given up on,  and it will be difficult, and in many  cases, impossible to keep those promises.  Mr. Speaker, why don’t we just waive  this promise of accomplishing all these  things in the first 100 hours so the people of America can be heard on the  floor of the Congress.  ",2007
7,9,2007-01-05,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, for the  purpose of debate only, I yield 1 minute  to a new Member, the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY).  (Mr.  COURTNEY  asked  and was  given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2007
8,9,2007-01-05,Mr. COURTNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in full support of the civility provisions  offered in part today as one of the new  rules of the 110th Congress. I applaud  the new Democratic leadership for offering this reform package, because our  country needs a fair and functioning  Congress if we are ever going to meet  these huge challenges that we face as a  Nation.

10,16,2007-01-05,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY).  ",2007
11,16,2007-01-05,Mr. CONAWAY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the ranking member, and I appreciate  the opportunity to talk. I was just trying to clarify a couple of things on the  package to make sure that we understand what it is we are actually doing  to ourselves.  I spent 2 years on the Budget Committee, and it was a very informative  time. I sat through hours and hours of  conversation by my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle touting the virtues of PAYGO and that they thought  this would solve the problems of the  world, knowing all along that their  version of PAYGO that they talked  about was, in fact, a stealth tax increase, given the current Code that we  have in place with respect to the taxes  on capital gains and dividends, as an  example, and the death tax that will  come back in full force in 2011 unless  we actually do something to it.  So as we consider this PAYGO concept, I would  like  for the American  people to know that the devil is in the  details, as with everything that we, in  fact, do.  When I campaigned, when most of my  colleagues  campaigned,  none  of  us  campaigned on increasing deficits. We  all campaigned, on both sides of the  aisle, on reduced spending, on smaller  government, all those kinds of things  that both sides are saying during this  debate today. But I am not sure this  PAYGO version will, in fact, do that.  Also the point we were trying to  check right now, I believe in addition  to the rules included in this rule is a  change in the Rules Committee itself  to allow for votes in the Rules Committee to be not reported out in the  rule. So the Democrat-controlled Rules  Committee can waive this PAYGO rule  and we won’t know which of the members actually voted to do that because  of the way this rule is.  It is interesting yesterday that the  word ‘‘transparent’’ was used often by  the folks on the other side of the aisle,  and yet one of the areas  in which  transparency seems to have been reduced is with respect to the rule that is  included in here with respect to the  Rules Committee.  So with respect to PAYGO, I want  my colleagues and others to know that  this is a stealth tax increase that is  being foisted upon our economy.  ",2007
12,16,2007-01-05,Mr.  HASTINGS  of  Florida.," Mr.  Speaker, I am very pleased at this time  to yield 1 minute to a gentleman that  was a sheriff that had to pay as he  went with reference to equipment for  his department, BRADELLSWORTH from  Indiana.  b1130  ",2007
13,16,2007-01-05,Mr. ELLSWORTH.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding time.  I thought I was going to get to follow  a fellow Hoosier, Mr. PENCE, until we  changed the rules. But as a proud member of the Blue Dog Coalition, I am  proud to stand today to voice my support  for restoring the pay-as-you-go  budgeting.  Inclusion of  the PAYGO  provision in the new House rules will  undoubtedly force us to make tough  decisions, but quite frankly we have no  choice. The total National debt is an  astounding $9 trillion, and tough decisions need to be made by Congress. By  restoring PAYGO budgeting, we will  take a positive step toward reducing  and easing the Federal deficit. Hoosier  families in my district make tough decisions every day about how to balance  their budget, and it should be no different from the Congress of the United  States.  Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation  to be  fiscally disciplined  in  implementing pay-as-you-go budgeting, and  this is a great place to start.  ",2007
14,16,2007-01-05,Mr. RYAN  of Wisconsin.," Madam  Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Mr. HENSARLINGof Texas.  ",2007
15,16,2007-01-05,Mr. HENSARLING.," Madam Speaker,  I thank the gentleman for yielding, and  I wish to join a number of my colleagues  in  congratulating  the  new  Democrat majority for their work in  the area of earmarks. We know that  earmarks are perhaps a small portion  of spending in this body, but they are a  large portion of the culture of spending. And I certainly salute them for  that work; but, Madam Speaker,  I  must reluctantly oppose this rule because of the so-called PAYGO provision  which has been adequately pointed out  is really a tax-go provision.  If PAYGO  indeed  lived up  to  its  name, it would be worthy of support,  but it is not. I fear that it is nothing  more than false advertising. I listened  very carefully to our new Speaker yesterday when I believe she said that  there would be no new deficit spending  under the watch of the Democrat majority. But as I look at this so-called  PAYGO provision, I see nothing that  deals with entitlement spending, which  threatens to bankrupt future generations,  our  children  and  our  grandchildren, with either massive debt or a  massive tax increase.  Over half of our budget deals with entitlement spending. There is nothing  that deals with that. It doesn’t deal  with baseline budgeting. Now, most  Americans don’t know what that is, it  is inside baseball, but it is an accounting concept that would make an Enron  accountant blush. It puts in automatic  inflation for government programs, yet  we don’t call it new spending. And yet  there  is  nothing  in  this  so-called  PAYGO provision dealing with that.  And we don’t even have a statute.  It is also false advertising, Madam  Speaker, because it doesn’t live up to  what the Democratic majority advocated when they were in the minority.  We have a rule; we don’t have a statute, the rule that will end up being  waivable. We don’t have the sequester  mechanism of earlier PAYGO. We don’t  have  the wedding with  the  discretionary caps that we had. And, indeed,  what we have  is a subterfuge here.  What we have is a Trojan horse for  more tax increases on small businesses  and American families that threaten  the jobs of Americans, and we must  vote this down.  ",2007

18,16,2007-01-05,Mr. KAGEN.," Madam Speaker, my  good friend Mr. RYANfrom Wisconsin, I  was elected to send a message to Congress to balance its budgets and to be  fiscally  responsible. As PAUL notes, in Wisconsin thousands of hardworking people have  lost their  jobs;  and when  they  lost  their manufacturing  jobs  offshore, much  of  the  wealth of this Nation was sent offshore  along with those jobs.  We need a positive change in America, and it needs to start now, right  here and  right now  in  the people’s  House. Let’s begin to build a better future for everyone by dedicating ourselves to becoming fiscally responsible  today, not next week. And then when  we do, let’s ship our values overseas  and not our jobs.  I rise before you today to urge you to  support pay-as-you-go as a means to  become fiscally responsible. We cannot  realistically begin to solve the many  problems we face until we completely  reverse the misguided fiscal policy of  borrow and  spend, and borrow and  spend, and borrow and spend, which has  driven our country into more debt than  our children can possibly repay. Let us  agree to live within our means here in  the House as we do in our own homes  back in Wisconsin.  ",2007

21,23,2007-01-05,Mr. BRADY of Texas., Will the gentleman yield?  ,2007
22,23,2007-01-05,Mr. MCGOVERN.," No, I will not. We  sometimes report and file a special rule  late one night, and the next morning  the rule and the bill are on the House  floor. There is just not much room for  even minor clerical errors when you  are under such tight deadlines. This  rules change does not mean that the  public will have any less access to what  happens  in  the  Rules  Committee,  Madam Speaker.  We plan to include record votes in  the Rules Committee reports and, even  better, we intend to post committee  votes on the Rules Committee Web site  as soon as they have them, so that the  American people will know what  is  going on.  Even better than that, we plan to  have more meetings during the daylight hours so that the public and the  press know what we are doing in the  Rules Committee.  Well, let me say to my friends on the  other side of the aisle, if you feel that  the votes taken  in the Rules Committee are not being made public fast  enough, or are clear enough, you have  my word that we will work to fix it,  and we will work with you. You have  my word on that.  More importantly, Madam Speaker,  after our business here in the House  concludes today, we will have made  historic progress. We will have ended  the  culture of  corruption  that has  plagued this House for the past dozen  years. We will have paved the way to  accomplishing what the American people voted for, to give minimum wage  workers a raise.  Right now the average CEO of a Fortune 500 Company earns $10,712  in 1  hour 16 minutes. It takes an average  minimum wage worker  52,  40-hour  weeks, an entire year, to earn the same  $10,712. It is wrong, and we are going to  fix it.  We will have paved a way to make  college tuition and prescription drugs  more affordable, to make our homeland  safer, by implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and to invest in lifesaving stem cell research.  All of these measures, Madam Speaker,  have been  the  subject of hearings.  Many of them have been voted on. But  the majority on the other side has  stalled and undermined these measure  at every step. No more.  Finally, Madam Speaker, let me assure my friends, including the distinguished gentleman from Florida, that  we will conduct the business of this  House in a much more fair, civil and  open way than has been the norm of  the last 12 years. Your views will be  heard more than ours were. Your ideas  will be given more consideration than  ours were. Your voices will be more respected than ours were, because that is  the  right way  to  run  the people’s  House.  ",2007
23,23,2007-01-05,Mr. GINGREY.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in opposition to Title V of H. Res. 6 and encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this  measure.  Since the election we have heard promises  of grandeur from the new Democrat majority.  They have promised to usher in a new era of  civility, bi-partisanship, and cooperation  into  the halls of Congress. They have repeatedly  stated that the American people want a civilized tone in Washington. But it appears the  Democrats are ignoring their own message.  In the opening hours of this Congress, with  their very first piece of business, the Democrats have put forth a resolution that is the opposite of civility and transparency—indeed, a  total contradiction of the way they pledged to  conduct business. For the first time in the history of this body, Madam Speaker, the Democrats have included closed rules governing future debate in the House rules package, and  have even gone so far as to prevent the Rules  Committee  from meeting  to deliberate  these  rules or the larger rules package.  But they did not stop there, Madam Speaker. After promising an open and fair process,  the Democrats have allowed just 10 minutes  of debate—that’s 5 minutes per side—on Title  V of this resolution.  This is no small measure, Madam Speaker.  Included in Title V are closed rules governing  debate  on  stem-cell  research,  the  recommendations of  the 9/11 commission,  the  cost of prescription drugs, and the federal minimum wage. Certainly  the American people  expect a debate of ideas and the proper congressional process for some of the most important issues facing our Nation. Instead, the  Democrats will deliver 10 minutes of debate.  Further Madam Speaker, Title V of this resolution will prevent  the votes of  the Rules  Committee from being made public. A veil of  secrecy will  fall over  this critical committee  they now control. This is not the transparency  and accountability in our political process the  Democrats have promised.  So, Madam Speaker,  it appears  the new  age of the Democrat majority will unfortunately  not live up to its much-hyped billing. Instead of  more openness,  fairness, and  transparency,  the Democrats have revealed the hypocritical  nature of  their disingenuous promises with  their very first piece of legislation. Reneging  on  their campaign promises  in  the opening  hours of this session is no way to build the  spirit of trust and cooperation across the aisle.  Madam Speaker, I hope for the sake of the  American people that the Democrats start adhering to their pre-election rhetoric and conduct the business of this body in a civilized  manner.  ",2007
24,23,2007-01-05,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today  in support of H. Res. 6,  the House  Rules Package for the 110th Congress. With  the passage of this resolution, we are committing ourselves to restore honest leadership, civility, and  fiscal  responsibility  to  the U.S.  House of Representatives. It is a commitment  that we owe to our constituents and to our Nation.  Unfortunately, over the past several years,  the House  of Representatives was  transformed from the people’s House into a legislative body where  those who could afford  to  make  their  influence  felt  far  too often held  sway. Legislation was enacted that benefited  the wealthy few instead of the vast majority.  Legislation was enacted—often in the middle  of the night—without time for review or careful  consideration. Legislation was enacted to benefit those who could afford to pay for fancy  meals and golf vacations while legislation that  would improve wages and the quality of life for  working Americans was ignored. The process  was  abused,  votes were  held  open,  and  amendments were prohibited  from being offered. The  losers have been  the American  public.  Perhaps the single best example of these  abuses is the Medicare Modernization Act, a  law which actually prohibits Medicare from negotiating for drug savings, as the VA and large  employers do today, and by doing so guarantees that senior citizens and persons with disabilities will pay more than they should for the  drugs that they need. This law would not have  been enacted  if pharmaceutical companies  had not been allowed to use undue influence,  if Democratic conferees had not been locked  out of  the negotiations,  if Members had not  been intimidated on the House floor, and if the  final vote had not been held open for nearly 3  hours to change the outcome.  During the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress, we will eliminate this prohibition and require that Medicare use its bargaining clout on  behalf of consumers. Today, we are  taking  steps to make sure that the procedural abuses  that were used  to enact  that prohibition will  become a relic of the past.  We also begin the 110th Congress by putting our financial house in order. The past 6  years of fiscal mismanagement has turned a  $5.6 trillion surplus into an over $3 trillion deficit. The passage of H. Res. 6 will help us get  our current debt and financial crisis under control while allowing us to make the investments  needed  for American  families and our economic future.  With the restoration of pay-as-you-go budgeting, Congress will not be able to increase  the deficit and make  future generations of  Americans carry a debt load so that today’s  wealthy can get tax cuts like the ones passed  over the past few years. According to the non-  partisan Congressional Budget Office,  those  tax cuts, which primarily benefit the very rich,  are the main cause of our country’s fiscal reversal. Reining in the spiraling debt will give  us a chance to invest in our communities, create jobs, provide retirement security, and stimulate our economy.  Transparency requirements for earmarks will  also help us make certain that taxpayers’ dollars are put  to good use while eliminating  wasteful spending. I believe that district-specific earmarks on appropriations or other legislation should not be provided unless they directly improve our communities. Requiring better disclosure of sponsorship of earmarks and  ensuring  that Members have no personal  financial  interest  in  the  request will help us  guarantee that the funding is targeted to essential  infrastructure  improvements, community development, vital research, and other important programs. Congress has a long history  of providing earmarks for such projects, and I  support their continued funding and eliminating  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:37 Jan 06, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K05JA7.040 H05JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007

31,30,2007-01-05,Mr. POE.," Mr. Speaker, ‘‘To be born  free is an accident, to live free is a  privilege, and to die free is a responsibility.’’ Powerful words  spoken  by  Brigadier General James Sehorn that  are embedded into the minds of our  valiant  soldiers  protecting  nations  from a cowardly enemy that burrows  beneath the Iraqi desert sands, those  individuals that seek to annihilate our  freedoms that all people should have.  The American  soldier  believes  in  freedom more  than any other  individual on Earth because they witness  the inhumanity of tyranny. They see it  in the fierce trenches of battle. Our soldiers secure life and liberty, and they  give it to those folks in Afghanistan  and Iraq.  U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Edward  Charles Reynolds, Jr. was one of these  soldiers. He was an 8-year Army veteran. Staff Sergeant Reynolds had been  stationed among the terrorist Iraqi insurgents, fighting against them to ensure a free nation of Iraq.  He is a native of Port Arthur, Texas,  and he was a 1997 graduate of Thomas  Jefferson High School, where he was a  star tight-end and middle linebacker  on the football team. As a Texan, Staff  Sergeant Reynolds spent fall football  seasons cheering for one of the greatest  teams in college football, the University of Texas Longhorns. Those who  knew him knew a man who took care  of others, whether it be his family, his  friends, or his country. Staff Sergeant  Reynolds was their protector.  Family was  the most  important  thing to Staff Sergeant Reynolds. He  was a devoted father to his children,  two daughters and a son. He was dedicated to his fiancee. He was the guardian of his older sister. Friends knew  him as the man that kept them out of  trouble, pushing them to succeed  in  life. And his country knew him as a defender of our freedoms.  In December  2005, Staff Sergeant  Reynolds was deployed to Iraq, worlds  away, but he remained a constant presence in the life of his family and all of  his friends. He sent out cards and letters, constantly reminding his fiancee  of their New Year’s Eve wedding date.  During the next 10 months, assigned to  the U.S. Army  1st Battalion,  67th  Armor Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, Staff Sergeant Reynolds dodged bullets, IEDs, and Iraqi  outlaws  throughout  the  Baghdad  desert.  But on September 26,  less than 2  months from coming home to Texas,  Staff Sergeant Reynolds and a fellow  soldier were crossing a Baghdad bridge  in a military convoy when that bridge  collapsed, plunging their vehicle underwater, trapping both soldiers inside. 27-  year-old Staff Sergeant Reynolds and  his colleague were killed in action, becoming victims  in  the  struggle  for  Iraqi freedom.  A decorated soldier, Staff Sergeant  Reynolds was the recipient of the Combat Infantry Badge, the Kosovo Campaign Medal. He was also awarded the  Iraqi Combat Campaign Medal,  the  Global War  on  Terrorism  Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Bronze  Star. He was a lifelong member of the  Borden  Chapel Missionary  Baptist  Church. And like his mother and father, Staff Sergeant Reynolds had a devout faith in his Almighty God, believing that everything he was given was a  gift by Him.  On October 7, the Borden Chapel Missionary Baptist Church in Beaumont,  Texas, and the Reverend Airon Reynolds, Jr., gave this brave soldier a  hero’s memorial  and  homecoming.  Family and friends were not the only  ones who memorialized and honored  Staff Sergeant Reynolds. The Patriot  Guard Riders and the Southeast Texas  Veterans Service thanked him for his  valor. More than 200 Patriot Guard  Riders, with  flags of tribute raised,  stood in honor of Staff Sergeant Reynolds, the son of Texas, an American  soldier, as he reached his eternal resting place.  Mr. Speaker, I have a photograph of  Sergeant Reynolds, the way that he  was when he was protecting freedom  across the desert sands of Iraq. American citizens are born into the privilege  of  freedom, and we must remember  that the sacrifice given by Staff Sergeant Reynolds and all American warriors  is responsible  for the continuation of this great Nation.  Staff Sergeant Reynolds  chose  to  protect the freedom that he was born  into from the violent militants robbing  nations of life and liberty. So God bless  Staff Sergeant Reynolds and his family.  In the words of George Orwell: ‘‘We  sleep safely in our beds because rough  men stand ready in the night to visit  violence on those who would do us  harm.’’  And that’s just the way it is.  f  ",2007

Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this  afternoon to congratulate the Rutgers  Scarlet Knights on their recent victory  over Kansas State in the Texas Bowl.  Last Thursday  the Scarlet Knights  cruised to a 37–10 victory over the Kansas State Wildcats, capping their memorable season with the first bowl win in  school history.  Running back Ray Rice led the winning effort with 170 yards rushing and a  touchdown. Wide receiver Tim Brown  scored two touchdowns, which, combined with Rutgers’ stifling defense,  was more than enough to put away  Kansas State. The defense held Kansas  State under 200 total yards and did not  allow an offensive touchdown.  Coach Greg Schiano led his team to  an 11-win season this year for only the  second time in Rutgers’ history. In his  five short years since becoming head  coach at Rutgers, Coach Schiano has  turned the program around from a 2–9  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:14 Jan 06, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K05JA7.053 H05JAPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007

36,37,2007-01-05,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, I came to  the floor to talk a little bit about national security and where the Nation’s  defense apparatus stands as of now. But  I thought I also might comment on the  comments that were made by two of  my wonderful colleagues, Ms. WOOLSEY  of California and Mr. PAUL of Texas,  who preceded me and commented about  their position to the effect that we  should bring our troops home immediately from Iraq. And implicit in their  comments was the message that somehow Saddam Hussein’s continued rule  of Iraq would have been preferable to  the American intervention.  I disagree with that theme, and let  me tell you why. In listening to Ms.  WOOLSEY talk about the wounded, the  KIA, the suffering in that part of the  world, and the burden that has been  borne by American soldiers, I think it  is also important to remember the Iraq  that was represented by Saddam Hussein.  And while she has, obviously, the images that have compelled her to take  her philosophical position, the image  that I have, and I keep in my desk  drawer, is the photograph of the hundreds of mothers whose bodies are  strewn across the hillside in northern  Iraq, holding their children, some of  them newborn babies, some of them  four, five, 6 years old, dead in mid-  stride where they were hit by poison  chemical, poison chemical that was delivered into those villages at the order  of Saddam Hussein.  And I have taken, as a guy who sometimes watches the History Channel, to  tuning in when I see the History Channel reviewing the exhuming of bodies  in these mass graves and putting together this story, this mosaic of Iraq  history under Saddam Hussein and the  story of how hundreds of people, men,  women and children, would be herded  across fields and they would be executed and their bodies would be pushed  into mass graves. And now we are uncovering those mass graves.  And just like the mass graves that  we found in Europe, especially those  that were filled by bodies that had been  people who had been executed by the  Nazis, there are more people now in  those mass graves, we find, than what  we had projected.  And as I watched the exhuming of  some of those bodies on the History  Channel, I noticed that the anthropologist who was doing the particular work  noted that the mother, in some cases,  who was executed would often have a  .45 bullet hole in the back of her head,  and her small baby that she was holding would also have a bullet hole in the  back of his or her head. So the monstrosity that was Saddam Hussein, the  mass execution, the killing of people  with chemical weapons,  is what the  American  troops displaced when we  moved into Iraq.  Now, it is tough to stand up a free  nation and stand up a military that is  able to protect it, but that is the challenge that we are meeting right now.  And we are following the same basic  pattern that we have followed for 60  years. Whether you are talking about  Japan or the Philippines or El Salvador  in our own hemisphere, first you stand  up a free government. Secondly, you  stand up a military that is capable of  protecting that free government, and  third,  the Americans, not  coveting  anything that that country has, the  Americans leave.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I thought I also  might speak just a little bit, as we turn  over the control of Congress to the  Democrat leadership, not only in the  full House, but also  the committee  chairmanships, and my own committee  chairmanship  now  has  been  relinquished to the gentleman  from Missouri, IKESKELTON, my good friend and  a wonderful person and a person with a  real heart  for the troops. I thought  that  I might  just  comment  about  where we stand right now. I think it is  important for the American people to  know where we stand and what this  Congress that is going out has accomplished for national security.  First, what have we done  for the  troops? Well, over the last 8 years we  have increased the pay for the Army,  the Air Force, the Navy, the Marines,  and the National Guard by right at 40  percent, a 40 percent pay increase. We  have increased family separation pay,  the amount of money that we deliver  to our military families when they are  separated when people are deployed  overseas. We have increased that from  $100 a month to about $250 a month. We  have increased our combat pay.  Mr. Speaker, I know I have only got  5 minutes, so I will elaborate on some  of the accomplishments that occurred  during this last Congress in the next  hour.  DEFINING EARMARKS  ",2007
37,37,2007-01-05,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," Under a  previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON-LEE)  is recognized for 5 minutes.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, again, thank you for the leadership given today and yesterday by  Speaker PELOSIand the House leadership for putting us on the right course.  And it is interesting to listen to my  good friends, and they are good friends,  who are on the other side of the aisle  and to listen to the conversation on  the Nation’s headline stations about  the commitment Democrats have made  to come to work. And we are delighted  that in the last couple of votes we saw  almost unanimous votes as relates to  our open government.  But let me, as a Member who comes  from a district that depends a lot on  the interests and concern of this Congress about issues of empowerment of  nonprofits and charitable organizations  who struggle every day to mentor children, to provide economic empowerment. Sometimes they provide assistance where government cannot. And  they are the recipients of earmarks.  And I think it is important that we define earmarks so that the maligning  that has occurred because of some inappropriate use  of  earmarks  really  doesn’t hide the value of allowing these  tax dollars to go back, not through  government bureaucracy but right to  the people.  is  b1430  An example of  that  the Texas  Southern  University  Laboratory  School, a school that is placed in a  public housing complex that educates  the  children and other  surrounding  children in that neighborhood in a progressive and op-educational system, so  much so that their test scores have excelled beyond public school. It is, in  fact, formerly a school that had been  embraced by the public school system,  and now has been spun off to Texas  Southern University, a teaching college, and the housing authority.  We have an earmark, of which I am  very proud to have all of the scrutiny  that anyone might want, that would  provide dollars to continue this interesting and provocative way of teaching  our children so that inner city children, children that would be pegged as  not being able to be creative, are actually passing their science tests, their  math tests, and they rush to school because they have a lust for learning.  That is an earmark.

40,72,2007-01-05,Mr. PAUL.," Madam Speaker, today I introduce the Social Security for American Citizens  Only Act. This act forbids the federal government from providing Social Security benefits to  non-citizens. It also ends the practice of totalization. Totalization is where the Social Security Administration takes into account the number of year’s an individual worked abroad, and  thus was not paying payroll  taxes,  in determining that individual’s eligibility for Social Security benefits!  Hard as  it may be  to believe,  the United  States Government already provides Social  Security benefits to citizens of 17 other countries. Under current  law, citizens of  those  countries covered by these agreements may  have an easier  time getting Social Security  benefits than public school teachers or policemen!  Obviously, this program provides a threat to  the already fragile Social Security system, and  the threat is looming larger. The administration’s totalization proposal, a version of which  passed the other body in the 109th Congress,  actually allows  thousands of  foreigners who  would qualify for U.S. Social Security benefits  actually came to the United States and worked  here illegally. Adding insult to injury, the federal government may even give Social Security benefits to non-citizens who worked here  for as little as 18 months.  That’s right: the federal government may actually allow someone who came to the United  States illegally, worked for less than the required number of years  to qualify  for Social  Security, and then returned to Mexico for the  rest of his working years, to collect full U.S.  Social Security benefits while living in Mexico.  That is an insult to the millions of Americans  who pay their entire working lives into the system and now  face  the possibility  that  there  may be nothing left when it is their turn to retire.  The proposed agreement  is nothing more  than a financial reward to those who have willingly and knowingly violated our own immigration  laws. Talk about an  incentive  for  illegal  immigration! How many more would break the  law to come to this country if promised U.S.  government paychecks for life? Is creating a  global welfare state on the back of the American taxpayer a good idea? The program also  establishes a very disturbing precedent of U.S.  foreign aid to individual citizens rather than to  states.  Estimates of what this latest totalization proposal would cost  top one billion dollars per  year. As  the system braces  for a steep  increase in those who will be drawing from the  Social Security trust fund while policy makers  seriously consider cutting Social Security benefits to American seniors and raising payroll  taxes on American workers,  it makes no  sense to expand Social Security into a global  welfare system. Social Security was designed  to provide support for retired American citizens  who worked in the United States. We should  be shoring up the system for those Americans  who have paid in for decades, not expanding  it to cover foreigners who have not.  It is long past time for Congress to stand up  to  the  internationalist bureaucrats and start  looking out for the American worker. I therefore call upon my colleagues to stop the use  of the Social Security Trust Fund as yet another vehicle for foreign aid by cosponsoring  the Social Security for American Citizens Only  Act.  f  TRIBUTE TO BEN STONE  HON. LYNN C. WOOLSEY  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 4, 2007  ",2007
41,72,2007-01-05,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker, I, along  with my colleague Congressman MIKETHOMPSON, rise today to honor Ben Stone, who recently completed 20 years of service as head  of  the Sonoma County Economic Development Board. Under Ben’s quiet but dynamic  leadership, the Economic Development Board  (EDB) has successfully implemented programs  that have more than met the mandate of the  County Board of Supervisors to enhance economic development by concentrating on new  and  innovative programs  that enable businesses  to remain competitive  in a changing  economy.  Ben came to Sonoma County from the Seattle area where he had been a county administrator  in Port Angeles, Washington, a consultant with Arthur Andersen & Co. and a Special Projects Director with Scafco Corporation.  He graduated from Whitman College in Walla  Walla and received his masters of Public Administration from the University of Washington  in Seattle.  Ben  tells  the story  that, after coming  to  Sonoma County, he was informed that a decision had been made to close the EDB. However, he commenced creating programs atypical of economic development, which bolstered  the  local economy, and, 20 years  later,  the  EDB is thriving under his leadership.  With the help of a small staff and interns,  Ben has developed a number of award-winning programs in concert with local private and  public sectors. Many of these programs have  been successfully transitioned to community-  based organizations.  Among them are the Sonoma County Tourism Program, which served to increase tourism  31  percent;  two  technology  groups  (SofTech, a trade group, and the North Bay  Techonology Roundtable,  a  policy  group);  Youth Business Week; the Business Environmental Alliance;  the North Bay WorId Trade  Association;  the Small Business Center now  operated by Santa Rosa Junior College; a  home-based business project; and a business  crime prevention program. Ben’s office still operates the Sonoma County Film Commission.  Ben also  initiated a broad-based strategic  planning process resulting in the formation of  bachelors and master’s degree programs  in  Engineering Science at Sonoma State University, a new cooperative agricultural marketing  program, and an economic research program.  An EDB  forum,  the Business Regulatory  Roundtable,  involving elected officials,  regulatory agencies, and business executives  to  improve local regulatory processes, resulted in  Northern California’s first multi-agency Permit  Assistance Center.  By  creating  the Economic Development  Board Foundation, the EDB is able to support  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:33 Jan 06, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A04JA8.022 E05JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 5 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2007
42,79,2007-01-05,Mr. TERRY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  in  strong support of the Calling for 2–1–1 Act of  2007. I am proud to lend my support as an  original cosponsor of this bill, which was introduced today by my colleague, Ms. ESHOOof  California. I would also like to note a concern  I have with the bill as introduced, which I hope  will be  resolved prior  to a vote  in  the  full  House of Representatives.  2–1–1 is the number designated by the Federal Communications Commission  to provide  citizens with information and referral about important community services and volunteer opportunities. United Way and its affiliates operate more than 200 call centers in 41 states  nationwide,  including my home state of Nebraska. About two-thirds of American citizens  currently have access to 2–1–1 referrals. The  Calling for 2–1–1 Act will help achieve nationwide coverage for all citizens.  More than 50 percent of the calls made to  2–1–1 call centers are placed to meet basic  needs such as food, heat, clothing and shelter  for citizens  facing difficulty. 2–1–1 helps  to  keep citizens off long-term government financial aid such as welfare and food stamps by  meeting immediate needs before they become  crises. 2–1–1 also enhances homeland security by serving as an emergency backup to 9–  1–1 during natural disasters and other crises.  In my Congressional District alone, almost  40,000  Nebraskans  sought  information  through 2–1–1 between November 2005 and  October 2006. The top needs were for assistance with utilities, rent, food, housing, health  and dental care, furniture and tax preparation.  Thousands of Nebraskans were able to obtain  assistance from federal and non-profit community service agencies because of the existence  of 2–1–1.  2–1–1 was crucial during the aftermath of  Hurricane Katrina. When 9–1–1 emergency  lines were inoperational, 2–1–1 stepped up to  link citizens in dire need with critical services,  including emergency medical care,  food and  housing, and crisis  recovery and  relocation  services nationwide. Volunteer organizations  such as the Red Cross also benefit from people who call 2–1–1 seeking opportunities  to  give back to their communities. 2–1–1 meets  critical needs and merits federal aid, provided  that additional protections are put in place before this legislation is brought to a vote.  It was my privilege to work last year with  Ms. ESHOOand Mrs. CLINTON in the Senate,  as well as Mr. PICKERINGand Mr. BILIRAKIS in  the House of Representatives, to address important concerns for ‘‘socially sensitive’’ referrals before bringing the Calling for 2–1–1 Act  to a vote. As Members of Congress with deep  convictions for the protection of human life, we  drafted language to refer callers seeking pregnancy-related services to public health departments.  This reasonable compromise was designed  to ensure the 2–1–1 legislation does not become a vehicle for taxpayer funding of controversial referrals such as abortion. Unfortunately,  this  important  language, which had  been agreed upon by all parties, was not included  in  the  legislation  introduced  today.  I  look forward to working with my Ms. ESHOO  and my other colleagues to correct this situation.  If my concerns are not addressed, I would  be  forced  to vote against and actively  fight  against the legislation I have cosponsored and  worked to enact into law, despite my strong  support  for  increasing access  to 2–1–1  for  more American citizens. The fact that I have  again cosponsored this legislation despite my  concern is testament to the good working relationship I have enjoyed with Ms. ESHOOand  Ms. CLINTON, and which I trust will continue  during this new Congress.  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I look forward  to working with my colleagues on  the other  side of  the aisle  to help  this  legislation become law while ensuring it protects and upholds the sanctity of human life.  f  IN HONOR OF UNIVERSITY PARK  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  HON.

To commemorate this special occasion, Peoples Bank will hold an anniversary  celebration on Saturday, January 6, 2007, at  the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in  Munster, Indiana.  Peoples Bank was established in 1910 and  was organized with a focus to meet the many  needs of  its consumers. Peoples Bank was  originally known as  the First Polish National  Building and Loan Association. During  that  time, it was the main hub for church and social activities in East Chicago, Indiana. Over  several  decades,  the  association’s  name  changed numerous times, and in 1989, it was  renamed Peoples Bank.

He fought for our country during the Korean War.  Mr. Nelson enlisted  in  the United States  Navy before he had the opportunity to graduate from high school. He continued to serve  in the Navy during the Korean War. He served  honorably and  returned  to Liberty, Missouri.  Mr. Nelson recently received his high school  diploma  from  the Marcus School District  in  Marcus, Iowa.  Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join  me in recognizing Mr. Ted Nelson. His many  years of distinguished service and commitment to serving his country have been an inspiration. I commend him for his service, and  I am honored to represent him in the United  States Congress.  HONORING PRESIDENT GERALD  FORD  HON. JOHN L. MICA  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 4, 2007  ",2007
48,86,2007-01-05,Mr. MICA.," Madam Speaker, with the passing of President Gerald Ford our Nation, the  U.S. House of Representatives and the Ford  Family have  lost a  leader, a respected colleague and a loved one who was very special  to their lives.  Few American  leaders of our  time have  gained the admiration and appreciation so well  deserved and earned by our 38th President.  While our country has  lost a distinguished  leader and  the Congress has  lost a distinguished Member, Gerald Ford’s life and public  service will always remain a model for future  generations.  In October of 1999, I had the pleasure to  quietly sit and speak with President Ford at  the conclusion of a Capitol Hill reception that  was held after he was honored with the Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda.  While I had met him before, what struck me  on this special occasion was how such a great  man receiving the highest honor from our Nation and Congress could be so humble, so  gracious and so genuine.  How memorable it was for me to spend that  special  time with  that gentle man and great  American. How fitting it was that Gerald Ford  returned this week to the Capitol and the Congress he loved. While this gentle man belongs  to  the ages, he will always share a special  place in our hearts and fond memories.  f  TRIBUTE TO JOHN ABIJAH DAVIS  HON. STENY H. HOYER  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 4, 2007  ",2007
49,86,2007-01-05,Mr. HOYER.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to mark an important milestone in the life of  one of my  fellow Marylanders—John Abijah  Davis—who today celebrates his 100th birthday.  John Abijah Davis was born January 4,  1907 in an upstairs bedroom of his parent’s  house on North Sherman Drive  in  Indianapolis, Indiana—a home built by his Uncle, Issac  Davis. Named  after  another Uncle,  John  Davis, and his father, Abijah Alley Davis, John  A. Davis grew up in that home, attending St.  Phillip Neri school and parish, before moving  on  to Cathedral High School  in 1920, graduating in 1924 with the first full four-year class  in school history.  John Davis graduated from the University of  Notre Dame in 1928 with a BA in English. At  school, he counted among his friends Walter  ‘‘Red’’ Smith,  later a Pulitzer Prize winning  sports columnist for the New York Times, Miller Brewing Company heir Fred Miller and  Howard Phelan, who later in life donated the  famous ‘‘Touchdown Jesus’’ mural that adorns  the  facade of  the school  library overlooking  the football stadium.  In 1934, John A. Davis married Virginia  Lyon in Notre Dame’s historic Log Chapel in  a mass presided over by his cousin, Rev.  John O’Hara, then president of Notre Dame.  In 1936, John and Virginia had a daughter,  Mary Elizabeth Davis.  Moving  from  Indiana  to New York, John  Davis joined his brother Charles and opened  the Browne-Davis Furniture Co. The business  prospered and both became treasured members of the local community in Oswego. Selling  their successful business after 40-plus  years, the Davis brothers enjoyed a fulfilling  retirement.  John briefly became a constituent of mine  when he retired to Dameron, Maryland to live  with his daughter Mary Elizabeth. Following  her death in 2001, John moved to Cheverly,  Maryland,  residing with his grandson, John  Davis Porcari, and his wife and five children.  John Porcari served with great distinction as  Maryland Secretary of Transportation under  Governor Parris Glendening. He has recently  been  selected  by  Governor-elect  Martin  O’Malley to take on this position in his administration.  John Davis heads a family consisting of four  grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and two  great-great grandchildren. Dozens of nieces  and  nephews  from  four  generations  and  scores of friends continue to look up to Mr.  Davis,  including his grand-nephew, Lt. Col.  Harold VanOpdorp, USMC, who commands  the First Battalion, 24th Marine Regiment  in  Anbar Province, Iraq.  According to his family, John Abijah Davis  continues  to  teach  life’s most valuable  lessons—humility, duty and hard work, devotion  to one’s God, family and friends. These lessons are reflected in all those he has touched.  As he, his  family and  friends celebrate  this  milestone, they celebrate not the chronology  of years, but the character of the man.  I  join with his  family and many  friends  in  wishing him continued health and happiness  on his 100th birthday.  f  RECOGNIZING CHAD BRENTON FOR  ACHIEVING THE RANK OF EAGLE  SCOUT  HON.

Chad has been very active with his troop,  participating in many scout activities. Over the  many years Chad has been  involved with  scouting, he has not only earned numerous  merit badges, but also the respect of his family, peers, and community.

51,93,2007-01-05,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," Madam Speaker, New  Year’s Eve marked another grave milestone in  Iraq, as the United States lost its 3,000th soldier since  the war began. Attacks on our  troops are  increasing as civil war spreads.  America lost more troops in Iraq in December  than in any other month during the previous  two years.  As we honor the fallen, we must remember  the daily  life and death  consequences of  President Bush’s policies. The time to begin  withdrawing our  troops  from  Iraq has  long  since passed. The longer we have stayed the  course, the worse conditions in Iraq have become.  November’s elections were a mandate  for  change in Iraq. As more and more members  of the President’s own party deem the Administration’s policy a  failure, an overwhelming  majority of Americans are calling on President  Bush  to draw down our  troops  from  Iraq.  It  has become resoundingly clear that a military  solution is not possible. Our troops were not  trained for or sent to Iraq to referee a civil war.  An extended American military presence will  just continue to fuel the insurgency.  The Republican co-chair of the Iraq Study  Group, James Baker, warned  that  ‘‘We no  longer can afford to stay the course,’’ and Lee  Hamilton,  the Democratic  co-chair, agreed.  ‘‘The current approach is not working and the  ability of the United States to influence events  is diminishing. Our ship of state has hit rough  waters. It must now chart a new way forward.’’  Instead of continuing to stubbornly defend his  administration’s  failed  war  strategies,  the  President must now work with Congress and  foreign leaders to chart a diplomatic strategy  that reduces the violence in Iraq.  The President left the U.S. with no good options, but increasing the number of American  servicemen and women  in  Iraq  is an unacceptable course. The new Congress must use  its authority  to ensure  that  the calls of  the  American people do not fall on deaf ears.  It will take many years for the U.S. to move  beyond the setbacks we have suffered in Iraq.  Our military  is overstretched. Our diplomatic  authority has been severely diminished. We  have shifted our focus away from Afghanistan,  and a resurgent Taliban is increasing its attacks on American troops.  For those families whose sons and daughters died  in  the war,  the wounds will never  heal.  Illinois  is one of eight states  that  lost  more than 100 troops in Iraq. From Rock Island  to  Champaign,  from  Skokie  to  Carbondale, more than 100 families have suffered  the ultimate  loss.  It  is  time  to change  course.  f  RECOGNIZING  KENNETH  G.

HAROLD ROGERS  OFKENTUCKY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 5, 2007  ",2007
53,93,2007-01-05,Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.," Madam Speaker,  I rise today to pay tribute to an exceptional  Kentuckian, Mayor Charles  ‘‘Charlie’’ Beach  III. After serving 32 years as mayor of the City  of Beattyville, Kentucky, Mayor Beach is leaving office. I want to express my deepest gratitude for his many contributions and years of  public service.  Throughout his  tenure, Mayor Beach has  led a number of initiatives to improve the lives  of Lee County residents, build hope in our Appalachian region, and serve as an economic  and community development leader for the entire Commonwealth. Southern and Eastern  Kentucky has been plagued with inadequate  water and sewer infrastructure and poor housing opportunities. Mayor Beach has been the  driving force behind construction of two water  plants, a sewage treatment plant, and installation of necessary piping to serve and reach  the  rural  residents of Beattyville and Lee  County. In addition, Mayor Beach is well-regarded throughout the Commonwealth for his  vision of providing quality, affordable housing.  Since 2002, Mayor Beach has been a critical partner in our regional anti-drug initiative  ‘‘Operation UNITE.’’ Beach was a key early  supporter and critical ally in getting drugs off  our streets and cleaning up our communities.  He has consistently backed efforts to educate  our children on the dangers of drug use and  our program to help drug users find treatment  options.  In addition to his duties as mayor, Charles  Beach is also the Vice-Chairman of the Peoples Exchange Bank where he provides business development and public relations leadership. He is the former President of the Kentucky League of Cities and has served as the  Chairman of the Kentucky River Area Development District. These organizations promote  the welfare and economic growth of Kentucky’s rural and urban areas.  Madam Speaker,  I want  to  thank Mayor  Beach for his selfless sacrifice and service on  behalf of the people of the City of Beattyville,  Lee County, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. His dedication and integrity are an inspiration to us all and I know his contributions  will live on for many years to come.

54,100,2007-01-05,Ms. HARMAN.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to David Hermance, who was  killed in a plane crash in Southern California  on November 25th. David was  the North  American Executive Engineer  for Advanced  Technology Vehicles at Toyota, whose headquarters  is  located  in my congressional district.  Although most Americans may not know his  name, David Hermance was one of the most  influential engineers and environmentalists in  the country. He was only 59 years-old when  the  experimental  aircraft  he was  piloting  crashed into the Pacific Ocean, and his tragic  death is a stunning loss not only for his family,  but for the larger community he served.  Equally respected in the environmental community and the automotive industry, David was  known  as  the  ‘‘Father  of  the  American  Prius’’—and for good reason. He had a knack  for  translating  complex  systems and  technologies  into  easy-to-understand  concepts,  and he worked tirelessly to help lay-people understand the workings and benefits of hybrid  and other advanced-technology vehicles.  It was David’s passionate approach and  commitment  to  the environment  that helped  persuade a skeptical industry and auto-buying  public to appreciate the enormous potential of  his work. In fact, Madam Speaker, my family  drives two hybrid vehicles—one in California  and the other in Washington, DC.  David will be sorely missed—as an outstanding individual and beloved colleague. Our  thoughts and prayers are with his family: his  wife Mary, his children Keith and Kathy, his  grandson Colin and sister Bonnie.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE IMPACT  AID SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION BILL  HON. LEE TERRY  OFNEBRASKA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 5, 2007  ",2007
55,100,2007-01-05,Mr. TERRY.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  introduce legislation to help schools educating  the children of U.S. service members and  schools serving Native American children on  federal lands.  My legislation will improve the distribution of  school construction grants under  the  Impact  Aid program. Impact Aid compensates schools  affected by a federal presence such as military  installations or Native American reservations.  Because federal lands are exempt from local  property taxes, school districts located on or  near federal lands lose a major source of revenue without the federal Impact Aid program.  Currently, school construction grants under  Impact Aid allow unequal  funding between  military school districts and Native American  school districts. For example, although 36 percent of  the one million  federal students are  from military impacted schools, the majority of  school construction dollars are spent on  the  12 percent of Native American students.  In 2005 and 2004, $27 million in Impact Aid  competitive construction grants were awarded.  In 2005, only 1 of 8 competitive grants was  awarded to a military impacted school district.  In 2004, only three of 15 recipients were military school districts, and only one of 17 recipients in 2003 was a military school. In contrast,  the  formula  grants  under  the  Impact Aid  School Construction program are equally distributed between military and Native American  schools.  Considering that Impact Aid has historically  been underfunded  in meeting  the needs of  local school districts serving military and Native American families, this legislation is critical  to ensure the most equitable use of available  dollars.  Instead of sending 60% of funding toward  12 percent of federal students, the legislation  I am introducing today would ensure 80% of  school construction funding will be equally distributed between military and Native American  schools. This approach will help ensure a  high-quality education for the children of our  military members selflessly serving our Nation.  Priority would also be given to Native American districts in qualifying for emergency construction grants in recognition of the poor condition of too many Native American schools.  This  legislation will also help schools affected by Global Rebasing at the Department  of Defense (DoD). Over the next four years,  DoD estimates  that 38,000 military children  will be returning to U.S. schools from closing  overseas military bases. Under this legislation,  schools that experience a 10% increase in the  number of military students would be allowed  to apply for emergency Impact Aid construction grants.  I am confident this excellent legislation will  improve  the  Impact Aid program  to better  serve American families. I am proud that both  Native American school districts and military-  impacted school districts support the common-  sense approach of this bill. I look forward to  working with my colleagues on the reauthorization of Impact Aid later this year, and urge  every Member of Congress to review and cosponsor this legislation.  f  HONORING MICHAEL LOFTON AND  THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN  AND BOYS CONFERENCE  HON.

56,100,2007-01-05,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Michael  Lofton, an inspirational leader who is working  each day to make a difference in the lives of  young people  in his community. This past  summer Mr. Lofton  implemented an  idea  to  bring together 200 boys, men and parents in  the first African American Men and Boys Conference. His goal was to counteract the trends  where African American boys were  lagging  academically, disrupting classes, disrespecting  themselves, and often ending up incarcerated.  His passion for helping children led him to  the Austin School District, where he contacted  parents, school principals, health specialists,  professors, sociologists,  judges,  law-enforcement,  businesses,  community  leaders  and  clergy, in order to create a concentrated effort  to support young black men and boys in the  Austin community.  The monthly African American Men and  Boys Conference has continued to increase in  participation since its inception this past June.  It has also expanded from focusing on boys  and their academic needs to working with the  entire family to make a difference. Each month  these boys and their families focus good decision making, managing anger,  taking and  passing standardized  tests, completing high  school,  attending  college,  maintaining  a  healthy lifestyle, and knowing how and when  to seek assistance with school work,  It is people like Michael Lofton that are the  cornerstone of our communities making a difference each and every day. He was brave  enough and passionate enough to go out into  the community and establish his vision  for  change, and he has inspired others to work  with him to better our society. I commend Michael Lofton for all the work that he has done,  and know that this is merely the first step of  many great things to come.  f  HONORING SISTER MABLE  WILLIAMS  HON.

As Betty Suarez, her character  in  ‘‘Ugly Betty,’’ Ferrera plays a smart,  young Latina  professional  breaking  into the publishing world. The people  we see  in here on television and  in  movies have a great influence on our  communities  and  the  attitudes  of  Americans.  While 40 percent of American youth  ages 19 and under are children of color,  few of the faces that they see on television actually reflect those races and  cultures.  Through  her  work, Ms.  Ferrera is breaking down barriers for  Latinos and Latinas in prime-time television.  I commend America Ferrera and everyone involved in Ugly Betty for helping to break down the stereotypes and  provide a role model for young Latinas.  I hope we can work together to teach  everyone to appreciate diversity in our  country.  Congratulations, America Ferrera.  f  CONGRATULATING THE CITIES OF  NORFOLK, VIRGINIA BEACH, AND  PORTSMOUTH, VIRGINIA  (Mrs. DRAKE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)

This is the first complex in the Nation that is financed and  supported by more than one city. This  complex will serve over 60 adults from  our region who formerly lived in shelters, under bridges or on the street.  Congratulations to these three cities  who worked regionally and who worked  together  to address  the very basic  human need for shelter and providing  other comprehensive services such as  job  counseling, mental health,  substance abuse and drug-abuse treatment  as well. Congratulations to them, and  we hope other regions of the country  will follow their example, and they will  be a great model for our Nation.  f  COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT  OF 2007  (Mr. KLEIN of Florida asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2007
60,5,2007-01-17,Mr. KLEIN of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  the health of the American economy  depends on having a highly educated  skilled workforce, but studies show the  number one reason that students fail  to attend college today is cost.  In addition to tuition, fees, interest  rates on student loans have also risen.  Over the last 5 years the interest rates  on student loans have jumped by almost 2 percentage points, further increasing the cost of college. Many of us  were dependent on student loans to go  to college in the first place. I am one of  them.  Recently, when  I visited Pompano  High School in my district, I met many  exceptional  students who were concerned that they would have difficulty  managing tuition costs. These students  in Pompano High School deserve better, as students do all over the United  States. This Democrat bill would cut  the interest rate in half from the current 6.8 percentage to 3.4 percent over  the next 5 years.  This proposal will help over 5.5 million low- and middle-income students  and their families afford a college education and a way to a better life. As a  case in point, a study this year by the  U.S. Public Interest Research Group  estimates the average cost for a Florida student, what it will save over the  cost of its life is $4,400. That is a powerful incentive, and I ask everyone to  join us in passing this legislation.  f  AGAINST NEW IRAQ POLICY  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)  ",2007
61,5,2007-01-17,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker,  last week  something  very  disturbing occurred. President Bush had  an opportunity to demonstrate that he  understood the country’s concern, he  had a chance to finally articulate a  clear plan  for our country’s engagement in Iraq. But, instead, the President chose to escalate our involvement  in Iraq’s civil war by proposing a substantial  increase  in  the number of  American troops there, about half of  whom are based in Georgia.  Mr. Speaker, our troops have performed with great courage. They have  performed admirably in the Congress,  and the American people will continue  to support them and provide them with  every resource that they need. But we  need better leadership coming from the  President and his War Cabinet. This  new Democratic Congress is not going  to give the President a blank check,  and we will continue to demand answers to the tough questions that have  not been answered.  Rather than escalating our involvement in Iraq, I believe that any plan  should focus on shifting responsibility  to the Iraqis so that we can begin a  phased  redeployment. The American  people want change, of course, in Iraq,  and House Democrats intend to keep  pressing the President to provide it.  f  PASS THE COLLEGE STUDENT  RELIEF ACT  (Ms. SHEA-PORTER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I  am urging my colleagues today to pass  the College Student Relief Act. I speak  not only as a Congresswoman  from  New Hampshire, but also as the mother  of a college student and one about to  enter college.  These student loan interest rates are  absolutely crippling students’ ability  to go to college and putting a burden  on their families. These students are  also deeply concerned now about what  will happen when they go  into the  workforce and they have to pay a higher interest rate on their loans, as well  as paying for higher energy costs and  paying for rent and paying for all of  the other expenses that young adults  experience.  I urge my colleagues to please ease  the pain on these students, encourage  this higher education, because higher  education is the key to prosperity in  our country.  f  SUPPORT THE REDUCTION OF INTEREST RATES  FOR  STUDENT  BORROWERS  (Mr. AL GREEN of Texas asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)

64,12,2007-01-17,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding this time to  me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.  Res. 58. I saw Muhammad Ali as a man  of great courage, and I admired him for  this, not because of the courage that it  took to get in a ring and fight men bigger than he, but because of his stance  in 1967.  In 1967, he was 25 years old. He was  the  heavyweight  champion  of  the  world, and  for  religious beliefs, he  practiced what Martin Luther King  made popular, civil disobedience, because he disagreed with  the war.  I  thought his comments were rather astute at the time and were not complex,  but he merely said, I have no quarrel  with the Viet-Cong. He said the Viet-  Cong never called him a name, and because of his religious convictions, he  said he did not want to serve in the  military. He stood firm, a man of principle, and I really admired this as a  quality.  He is known, of course, for his athletic skills and his humanitarian concerns, and these are rightly mentioned  in a resolution like this. But I do want  to emphasize this because, to me, it  was so important and had such impact,  in reality, what Muhammad Ali did  eventually  led to getting rid of the  draft, and yet we as a people and we as  a Congress still do not have the conviction that Muhammad Ali had, because  we still have the selective service; we  say, let us not draft now, but when the  conditions are right, we will bring back  the draft and bring back those same  problems that we had in the 1960s.  I see what Muhammad Ali did as  being very great. He deserves this recognition, but we should also praise him  for being a man of principle and willing  to give up his title for 3 years at the  age of 25 at the prime of his career.  How many of us give up something to  stand on principle? He was a man of  principle. He believed it and he stood  firm, so even those who may disagree  with his position may say at least he  stood up for what he believed in. He  suffered the consequences and  fortunately was eventually vindicated.  ",2007
65,12,2007-01-17,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  do not believe we are going to have any  additional speakers so I am going to  yield myself such time as I might consume and close for our side.  Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate the  65th birthday of Muhammad Ali. Ali’s  charisma,  confidence and  skills not  only transformed boxing but the entire  sporting world.  b1115  His unmistakable one-liners and his  quick left jab enamored the public to  the point that Ali said, ‘‘I wish people  would love everybody else the way they  love me. It would be a better world.’’  Born on January 17, 1942 in Louisville, Kentucky, he started to train at  the age of 12 and earned Amateur Athletic Union and Golden Gloves titles as  an amateur. Then known by his birth  name, Cassius Clay, Jr., he became an  Olympic gold medalist and was  renowned for his strong right hand and  his dancing feet. He went on to fight  professionally and revived boxing at an  age when it was plagued by mob control.  The three-time heavyweight champion was  part  of many  legendary  fights,  including  opponents  Sonny  Liston, George Frazier, and George  Foreman. Ali used an unorthodox style  on which he relied on quickness to  dodge punches and to fool challengers  rather than holding his hands high to  defend his  face. Ali’s mix of poetic  movement and powerful blows in the  ring carried over to the comments he  made outside. His knack for creating  rhymes on the  fly and his powerful  paradoxes quoted  to  reporters made  him a magnet for the media. He once  said, ‘‘My way of joking is to tell the  truth. That is the funniest joke in the  world.’’ Ali made no qualms about  what he did or how good he was. He was  backed up in his claims and holds wins  over seven fellow International Boxing  Hall of Fame inductees.  In the early 1980s, Ali was diagnosed  with  pugilistic Parkinson’s  disease,  which  forced  him  into  retirement.  After his retirement and despite his  ailment, Ali has been committed to  many philanthropic efforts to reduce  poverty and hunger, to promote adoption, and to encourage cultural awareness. Ali was named Sportsman of the  Century in 1999 by Sports Illustrated  and is considered to be a modern legend  by many.  So, Mr. Speaker, Ali was indeed the  greatest, but he did leave Louisville  and  eventually moved  to  Chicago,  which is the greatest city, and so I was  fortunate as an individual to get to  know him and to get to know him well.  As a matter of fact, you could always  count on Ali to be present at community events, banquets, it didn’t matter,  local schools, playgrounds where kids  were.  He was a real ambassador for the Nation of Islam and was very involved in  his religious beliefs. A great man of integrity. As a matter of  fact, people  would often meet at his home for community meetings and gatherings and  people would just stop by. He lived in  what we call the Hyde Park community. And so he was indeed the greatest. He had no difficulty sharing himself with others.  So I commend Representative CARSONfor introducing this legislation and  urge its passage.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise in support of H. Res. 58, which honors  Muhammad Ali on  the occasion of his 65th  birthday. Muhammad Ali, who transformed the  sport of boxing with his unparalleled physical  gifts, social commentary, and poetry, is one of  the world’s most beloved athletes. Muhammad  Ali has been a fixture on the world stage since  the 1960, when he won the gold medal at the  1960 Olympics in Tokyo. He would go on to  win such legendary bouts as ‘‘The Rumble in  the Jungle’’ against George Foreman, and  ‘‘The Thrilla in Manila’’ against ‘‘Smoking Joe’’  Frazier.  Since his retirement in 1981, Muhammad Ali  has engaged  in many humanitarian endeavors, including a 1990 journey to Iraq to negotiate the release of 15 hostages. Muhammad  Ali may be out of the ring but interest in him  has not waned, 3 billion  television viewers  around the world watched him light the torch  that opened the Olympic Games in Atlanta in  1996.  In 1984 Ali was stricken with Parkinson’s disease. However true to form, Ali has  not let his illness stop him from being free to  do what he wants.  Never has a sports figure inspired so many  people  in so many different ways. Ali has  shown that a sport can be more than entertainment; it can also be a cultural event with  the power  to change social values. Muhammad Ali is one of the most recognized sportsmen of all time. His legacy is one that inspires  both in the ring and through his humanitarian  work.  Outside of the ring Ali was a tremendously  important  figure and ally  in  the Civil Rights  Movement of the 1960s. Ali refused to fight in  the Vietnam War due to his religion and because he said, ‘‘Ain’t no Viet Cong done nothing to me.’’ He has won countless awards for  his humanitarian efforts, including the Medal of  Freedom. If anyone is deserving of the accolades that are bestowed on him, Muhammad  Ali is certainly that person.  The Muhammad Ali  International Centre  opened in Ali’s home town of Louisville, Kentucky  in November 2005. The Centre holds  exhibits and provides  learning  initiatives.  It  was established to represent and promote the  values by which Muhammad Ali has lived his  life: confidence, dedication, respect, compassion, charity, and spirituality. It is hoped that  the Centre will provide those that visit the enlightenment and ability to become the greatest  they can be. Ali’s wife Lonnie said of the initiative: ‘‘the Muhammad Ali Centre is all about  searching  for  common ground and establishing peace.’’  On behalf of  the citizens of  the State of  Texas and my constituents of the 18th congressional district I would like to join my colleagues in honoring Muhammad Ali, a global  humanitarian, on  the occasion of his 65th  birthday and extend best wishes to him and  his family. Muhammad Ali reminds us all that  ‘‘learning to love yourself is the greatest love  of all.’’  Happy Birthday, champ! As you often said  after your many victories, you are the ‘‘Greatest of all time!’’  ",2007

67,19,2007-01-17,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina, the chairman of the Budget  Committee (Mr. SPRATT).  ",2007
68,19,2007-01-17,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of the rule providing for consideration of the College Student Relief Act. This bill is good for students,  it is good for the budget, and it is deserving of our support. This bill will  help make college more affordable to  students who need it most by cutting  the interest rate in half on subsidized  student loans.  College costs, as we all know, have  risen dramatically. In the last 5 years,  the cost of attending a 4-year public  college increased $3,095, or by 34 percent. Interest rates the students pay on  college loans have also risen this year  to a fixed rate of 6.8 percent. This combination of  factors makes attending  college more expensive, if not impossible, for some of today’s high school  students.  This bill, the bill before us, takes a  long first step towards making college  more affordable. Each year it cuts the  interest rate that undergraduates will  pay on the standard subsidized student  loans until that rate is cut in half to  3.4 percent  in the year 2011. At the  same time, the bill we have before us  will save the Federal Government by  reducing the deficit by a significant  sum.  That is why this bill meets all of the  tests laid down by the pay-as-you-go  rule which the House adopted on January 5. That rule requires that direct  spending or mandatory  spending be  budget neutral or deficit neutral over 6  years, 2007 through 2012, and over 11  years as well, 2007 through 2017, which  is as far out as our cost estimates run.  This bill is more than deficit neutral or  budget neutral because it actually reduces the deficits in most years, saving  $1.5 billion in 2007, $65 million over 6  years, and a total of $7.1 billion over  the next 11 years, 2007 through 2017.  So, overall, this bill helps students  get a good college education while  helping us reduce the deficit. It meets  the requirements of PAYGO. It is a bill  and a rule that deserves our support.  I would urge every Member on both  sides to vote for this rule and vote for  the rule that enables it to come to the  floor.  ",2007

70,19,2007-01-17,Mr. SESSIONS.," I thank the Speaker.  I also thank the gentleman, a dear  friend of mine from South Carolina, for  talking about how great this is for the  budget. Yet the rule waives points of  order that are contained in the budget.  Being specific, it is an explanation of  the waivers that we found out about.  The bill violates section 302(f) because its direct spending will exceed  the Committee on Education and Labor’s allocation, but that is good for  the budget.  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues have had  an opportunity on this side to talk  about why we are disappointed in this  closed rule and in the Democrats’ failure to provide a comprehensive solution to increasing higher education access  for our students that will help  keep America competitive.  Mr. Speaker, I would ask to insert in  the RECORDan article printed in The  Dallas Morning News, my home newspaper, from January 12, outlining the  way today’s Democrat proposal  fails  and falls short of their past promises.  [From the Dallas Morning News, Jan. 12,  2007]  DEMSPUSHRATECUTFORSTUDENTLOANS  WASHINGTON.—Following up on an election-  year promise, House Democrats said Friday  that they plan quick action to lower interest  rates for student loans.  Their proposal, scheduled for a vote next  week, would cut interest rates on some student loans in half. However, the college tuition plan has been scaled back since it was  first touted on the campaign trail last year.  The interest rate relief would apply only to  need-based loans and doesn’t help people who  take out unsubsidized student loans—a distinction not made in the campaign literature  Democrats handed out before winning control of Congress last fall. The measure also  abandons a pledge to reduce rates for parents  who take out loans to help with their kids’  college costs.  The rate cut for subsidized student loans—  from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent—would be  phased in over 5 years.  The measure would cost just under $6 billion, according to the Congressional Budget  Office.  To avoid increasing the deficit, the bill’s  cost would be offset by trimming subsidies  the government gives lenders and reducing  the guaranteed return banks get when students default. Banks also would have to pay  more in fees.  An estimated 5.5 million students receive  subsidized loans.  Republicans pushed a budget bill through  Congress  last session that cut $12 billion  from student loan programs. Democrats and  student groups argued  the money  should  have been preserved.

72,26,2007-01-17,Mr. KILDEE.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the College Student Relief Act.  By making college more affordable for  5.5 million students each year, this bill  is a big step in the right direction of  helping low- and middle-income families achieve the American Dream. Not  only is it a step in the right direction,  but it is a step in a new direction.  For years, the President and previous  Congresses have passed billions of dollars of  tax cuts  for  the wealthiest  Americans instead of investing in the  potential of average Americans. The  last Congress put college out of reach  for many families by passing a $12 billion raid on student aid, the largest cut  in the history of the student aid program.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 5 will save the  average borrower who starts at a 4-  year college at Michigan next year  nearly $2,200 over the life of the loan,  and will save the same student who  starts in 2011 more than $4,200.  Madam Speaker, when we debate the  Federal budget around here, we talk  about budget authority and outlays  and offsets, and other complicated accounting procedures. But, in the end,  what we really are talking about are  not just numbers but real people in  every corner of this country, making  tough decisions about their lives.  One of the toughest questions these  days is whether they can afford to attend or stay in college, especially because a college education is more important now than ever. These are real  people with names, not numbers, who  ask that question. They are people who  live in your district.  Very simply, the reason I support  this bill, and the reason I ask my colleagues to join me, is because this bill  will help thousands of students to say  yes to that question.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2007
73,26,2007-01-17,Mr. MCKEON.," Madam Speaker, at  this time I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. KELLER), the ranking member  on  the  Higher  Education  Subcommittee.  ",2007
74,26,2007-01-17,Mr. KELLER of Florida.," I thank the  chairman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise today as the  ranking member on the Higher Education  Subcommittee.  I  believe  in  higher  Pell  grants,  lower  interest  rates, and a leveling off of college tuition. I come to this belief through my  own life experiences. I grew up in relatively  humble  circumstances. My  mom was a single parent who raised  three kids on the modest salary of a  secretary. If it wasn’t for Pell grants  and student loans, I wouldn’t have been  able to go to college and, ultimately,  law school. I believe every child, rich  or poor, deserves the chance to go to  college.  Let us turn to student loans and how  that impacts that. When I graduated  from college in 1986, the student loan  interest rate I had on my loans was 9.5  percent. In 2002, during my first term  here  in Congress, we decided to do  something about that and we joined together, Republicans, Democrats, and  student groups, and approved legislation in January of 2002 fixing the student loan interest rate at 6.8 percent.  On  January  24  of  2002,  Chairman  GEORGEMILLER supported the 6.8 percent rate. He voted for the 6.8 percent  rate, and he said on this floor that we  should be commended for passing the  6.8 percent rate.  Last year, in March of 2006, when we  were passing the higher education bill  on the House floor, Chairman Miller  said that he wanted to now cut the interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. It had a big price tag of $18 billion. He didn’t offer any ways to pay  for it.  Today, he comes before us with another proposal to cut the rate from 6.8  percent, down to 3.4 percent, phased in  over a 5-year period, so you hit the 3.4  percent  in the  final year only. This  price tag is smaller, at $6 billion. And  to their credit, the Democrats have  come forward with a way to pay for it,  and that is mainly by taking money  out of the student lenders’ pockets.  The question before us is one of access. What is the best way to expand  college access? Should we help college  students on the front end afford to go  to  school  by  increasing  their Pell  grants, or do we help college graduates  on the back end by phasing down their  loan interest rates?  I think a better approach would have  been to take some of this $6 billion in  savings and invest it in the Pell grant  program. This is a program we Republicans have been pretty serious about  during my 6 years in Congress, and I  would like to show you a chart reflecting that.  This is the 20-year history of the Pell  grant program. As you can see, in yellow, this is the 10 years the Democrats  were in control of Congress. The red  represents when the Republicans took  control of Congress. You see a steep increase. If they had adopted the proposal we set forth, these charts would  be literally off the charts in terms of  such  a  dramatic  increase  in  Pell  grants.  Now, someone said earlier, well, we  haven’t done enough to increase Pell  grant funding during our time in the  majority over the past 6 years. Let us  take a look at that claim. Overall, Pell  grant funding from 2000 to today has  gone up 71 percent, from $7.6 billion to  $13 billion a year. And we have  increased by 36 percent the number of  children eligible for Pell grants from  3.9 million to 5.3 million. We have a  pretty good record on Pell grants, one  to be proud of.  If they had taken the $6 billion and  invested it in the Pell grant program,  what a dramatic difference  it would  make when you consider the Pell grant  program along with the Pell-eligible  programs  of  competitiveness  grants  and SMART grants.  This is the difference: First-year students would get up to $5,300 a year; second-year  students would get up  to  $5,850; third-year students would get  $8,050; and fourth-year students, up to  $8,050.

76,33,2007-01-17,Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas.," Madam  Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5.  This bill cuts student loan interest rates to a  fixed 3.4 percent over 5 years.  Right now, the average student loan debt is  around $13,800. By passing this bill, we are  saving a student with average debt $4,400  over the life of their loan.  Also,  this  legislation  targets middle-class  America. Half of the students that take on federally subsidized loans have incomes between  $26,000 and $68,000 a year.  This benefits millions of lower income families, but also hardworking middle-class Americans that are trying to give their children a leg  up in living the American dream.  College  tuition has risen 41 percent since  2001. Just  this year,  the percentage of students relying on loans to get through school  hit 52 percent.  This is a direct result of rising tuition costs  in both public and private institutions.  These  families need help and we should  give it to them. Twice a year, our office holds  a Paying for College workshop.  We bring in lenders and experts on filling  out the FAFSA to help our students navigate  through the application process and to come  they may  the amount of debt  to  terms with  take on.  The most important consideration for families in our Congressional District is what the  cost of going to college will be.  Financial barriers inhibit the ability of high  school graduates to go to college.  By reducing student loan interest rates, we  are encouraging families and students to get a  college education.  When we pass this legislation, we are investing in the future of our economy because  we will have more college graduates with a  lower debt burden.  This will enable graduates to do things like  buy homes, invest and fuel our economy.  To offset  the  costs of  reducing  interest  rates, we are reducing the amount the Federal  Government guarantees lenders.  While this is not a popular idea with large  lenders, smaller lenders will not be impacted  by this legislation.  Student loans are not the bread and butter  of large financial institutions, but smaller local  banks and credit unions often provide student  loans in smaller communities.  This is why lower volume lenders will not be  impacted.  Madam Speaker,  this  is a win  for middle  class America,  future generations of college  students and our Nation.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  ",2007

78,33,2007-01-17,Mr. HARE.," Madam Speaker, I thank  the chairman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, today’s college students are graduating with increasing  levels of student loan debt. In Illinois,  the average Stafford loan debt for students who graduate from a 4-year university is over $14,000. Unfortunately,  the  cost of  college  tuition  is  skyrocketing, forcing more and more students to rely on loans than ever before.  Because  I  believe higher  education  should provide economic opportunities  for our  students and not bankrupt  them, I rise today in support of H.R. 5,  the College Student Relief Act.  This  legislation will  cut  interest  rates on subsidized loans in half, saving  the average student thousands of dollars over the life of his or her loan. Additionally, by making student  loans  more affordable, H.R. 5 allows many  qualified  students  from middle- and  lower-income families to go to college  who would not have been able to go to  college before.  On behalf of the many students in my  district, such as those at Western Illinois University with whom I will be  discussing this issue this weekend, I  will vote for H.R. 5 and will work on  the Education and Workforce Committee to find better opportunities for  students and their hardworking families.

This bill will put college education  back in reach for millions of students  and their families.  The debt relief in this bill is targeted  to help the students who need it most,  students from 5.5 million working and  middle-class families across the country.  Here I am, a kid from a family of  seven whose parents came to this country without knowing English, without  much money, and without jobs waiting  for them. But with hard work, the  great support of  family and  friends,  and some good luck, and mostly because of affordable  student  loans,  I  made it where I am today. Each month  when I write that check to make that  payment on my student loan (because I  am still paying off my student loans) I  know that I am paying for an investment that was well worth it.  Many young people today find themselves where I was at age 18, wondering  what they will do with their lives; and  to  those  students,  especially  those  whose parents did not go to college, the  prospect of student loan debt can be  very frightening.  When I was working as a bilingual  aide in an elementary school to help  pay my college bills, I would always  talk to my students about going to college, what they would do when they  went to college, and how hard they  should work to prepare for college.  I used to talk to my kids about college all the time, and finally, one of  them asked me, Teacher, what is college?  It is a long road from discovering  what a college education is and what  doors it can open to choosing the right  college and then figuring out how to  pay for it.  This bill makes the paying-for-it part  a bit easier for millions of hardworking  students and families and helps students make an  investment  in themselves by reducing the burden of debt  that high interest rates create.  These students have worked hard to  open the door of opportunity that a  college education brings them. Those  of us who have already stepped through  that door have an obligation to hold it  open for those who follow, and the College Student Relief Act does just that.  This bill will help make the prospect  of college debt less daunting.  In this great Nation, what we teach  kids  from the youngest age  is that  there are no class barriers, that they  can achieve anything they work for.  Finances should not be a barrier between students and their educational  training.  This bill will save students and their families  thousands of dollars, giving them the opportunity to earn a college education. It will bring  many American dreams  that much closer  to  reality.

83,40,2007-01-17,Mr. MCKEON.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  I agree with much of what the majority leader just said. I think we do have  to expand access. We have to give opportunities to students.  My real concern is at the end of this  debate, I am hoping that students understand that the 6.8 percent interest  right now, tomorrow, doesn’t go to 3.4;  even if the Senate were to act on this  and pass this bill exactly, that it would  be almost 5 years, and then it only is  cut in half for a 6-month period. So  that if you look at how much they  really would save over the period of a  repayment, the way it works is when  they graduate, 6 months  later, they  have to, or they have the opportunity  to consolidate their loans and they can  take all the loans because they get one  their first year, one the second year,  third year, and if they go through in 4  years they probably up end up with  four  loans. They  consolidate  those  loans and they will take the interest  rates, well, anyway, they are 6.8 now,  and then they go to 6.1 and then they  work their way down to 3.4. They will  take how much they borrowed each  year. They  consolidate  those  loans.  They average those out, and they will  probably get a reduction of about like  41⁄2 percent. And  if they borrow the  maximum during that period of time,  they will end up with a savings of a little over $2,000, not $4,400, as some are  saying.  I think it is really important to really have the true facts out there so that  we don’t give people this idea that tomorrow my interest rate is cut in half.  And also, that only pertains to the 50  percent of students that are borrowing  on the subsidized basis. I know the  promise during the campaign was, we  are going to cut student loans across  the board in half for all students. But  when you tested that out you found out  it cost about $60 billion, and to comply  with the PAYGO they had to come  back with this reduced offer.  Again, it will help people that have  graduated from college, but those people are already well on their way to realizing  the American Dream.  If we  could just take this same amount of  money, the savings and try to help  those who are trying to get into college, that is probably the major difference in our debate, is how we help  people get an opportunity, not those  who are now graduating and are benefiting from the college graduation and  also benefiting from this reduced student loan rate.  Madam Speaker, I am happy now to  yield to my  friend  from Mississippi  (Mr. WICKER) 4 minutes.  ",2007
84,40,2007-01-17,Mr. WICKER.," Madam Speaker, I expect a lot of Members on both sides of  the aisle are going to vote for this legislation. I can’t vote for it because it  doesn’t live up to the rhetoric that we  have heard from the proponents of the  legislation in debate today.  If you want to come up with a bill to,  indeed, make college more affordable  for middle America, then count me in.  If you want to improve access to a college education  for millions and millions of American young people, then  count me in. If you want to do something about the very real problem of  slowing the growth rate of college tuition, which is really what we should be  getting at, then count me in. But I  don’t think this bill does any of that.  And frankly, I am afraid that in the  end this legislation, if enacted, would  actually make  a  college  education  more expensive.  But I have to respond to some comments made by my friend from Virginia, Mr. MORAN, just a few moments  ago to the effect that Republicans are  not  interested  in helping Americans  get a college education, that we somehow have a poor record in supporting  student aid and higher education.  I  would take strong exception to those  remarks, and I would submit to the  contrary, Madam Speaker, that House  Republicans, over 12 years of Republican majorities in this House of Representatives, have a proud record of  working  to  expand  college  access  through a two-pronged effort: Number  one, working to hold institutions more  accountable for their role in college  costs, and this bill does nothing to address  that whatsoever,  and number  two, maintaining a historic bipartisan  commitment to Federal student aid.  Under 12 years of a Republican majority in this House of Representatives we  have achieved record levels of overall  student aid, more than tripled what it  was a decade ago. We funded more Pell  Grants, a two-thirds increase over the  past decade. In addition, the Republican record on student aid  includes  new grant aid for Pell Grant students,  higher loan limits to give students access to more financial aid, lower loan  fees so that students can keep more of  what they borrow, tuition savings and  deductibility,  reduced  student  loan  payments and ending the single holder  rule, student loan relief for higher demand teachers—and certainly, that is  something that we could have hearings  about and have a bipartisan consensus  about, Madam Speaker, targeting this  student aid to those students who plan  to go into difficult areas where there is  a great need in this country—taxpayer  savings through fewer lender subsidies  and, finally, less fraud and abuse in  Federal student aid.  So I would submit that this party has  had a proud 12-year record of accomplishment in student aid, and I could  not let the statements of my very good  friend  from Virginia go uncontested.  We are all  for helping students,  for  making college education more affordable and more accessible and for helping move more people into a higher  education and a better way of life for  them and their families. And I don’t  think this bill gets us there. I think 12  years of Republican leadership is something that we can all be proud of. So I  will be voting against the bill.  ",2007

In listening to my friends from the  other side of the aisle, first of all, I am  sorry my friend from Georgia is not  here because I think I could tell him  who the 10 percent are who don’t believe in clean air, at least I could direct him to people in the administration and to the committee leadership  on the other side of the aisle for the  last 12 years who proposed policies that  clearly indicate that they don’t care  about clean air.  It  is  amusing  to hear  from  our  friends from the other side of the aisle  who for 12 years have run the show and  are complaining about  some of  the  choices that are being made by some  4,000 institutions of higher education.  If they had something that they wanted to do, I am sorry, but they didn’t for  the last 12 years. But what we have  done in the first 12 days is to act to  make a difference.  ",2007

93,47,2007-01-17,Mr. MCKEON.," I introduced a bill that  really would have addressed some of  these issues. In fact, in the last Congress we passed a bill out of this body.  It stalled on the other side of the Capitol, but we passed a bill out of this  body that would have addressed some  of those issues, and we did it in a bipartisan way. I appreciate those who voted  for it on that side of the aisle.  ",2007
94,47,2007-01-17,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," And I am saying  for 12 years they had a chance. I am  sorry if you couldn’t work with the administration and the Republicans who  ran the other Chamber. But my point  is I am not dealing with Taj Mahals; I  am dealing with community colleges  that have not had the basics. I am not  talking about rock walls for 50 students at one time; I am talking about  basic  laboratory  space,  classroom  space,  library space, people who are  having difficulty getting access.  The point is that the people on the  other side of the aisle have been talking about this while they have been  cutting  opportunities  and  cutting  budgets, cutting taxes. This bill continues our  commitment  to working  families, promoting competitiveness in  the workforce by starting by cutting  interest rates on these subsidized unBLUMENAUER.  I  would  be  to yield on  the gentleman’s  be  I  would  dergraduate loans. It targets the lower  and middle income students and their  families with the most financial need  and the least support.  The poor often get grants; the rich  don’t need them. This bill would save  that college borrower  in the middle  thousands of dollars. In my State in  Oregon, our students have the second  highest amount of debt in the country.  Over 40,000 Oregon students a year will  be substantially helped by this legislation amongst the 51⁄2million students  around the country in times of skyrocketing tuition.  Now, unlike the Republican approach  of the last 12 years of cutting budgets  and cutting taxes and putting the tab  on the credit cards of our youth, this  bill is fully paid for by offsets. Five of  these six were included in President  Bush’s fiscal year 2006 budget and have  bipartisan support.  We owe it to our students, our communities, and hard pressed families to  make college not just a dream but an  affordable reality, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5 as an important first step in making that happen.  ",2007
95,47,2007-01-17,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,  I yield to the gentleman  from New  York (Mr. ENGEL) for 1 minute.  ,2007
96,47,2007-01-17,Mr. ENGEL.," I thank the Chairman  for yielding to me.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5. This legislation will help  ease the burden of student loans that  so many of today’s young people face  by cutting loan interest rates in half  over the next 5 years.  As the father of three, I am all too  familiar with the challenges of financing a college education.  I have one  child  in  law  school, one  in undergraduate school. It is very, very difficult. I can imagine the vast majority  of the American  families that don’t  make what Members of Congress make,  how even more difficult it is for them.  So a college education becomes out of  reach  for many  families. It  is very,  very important.  We are going to cut student loan interest rates in half by the next 5 years.  The vast majority of student loan borrowers are low to middle income students who are burdened with huge  amounts of debt upon graduating. In  my home State of New York, the average subsidized Stafford loan debt for a  4-year graduate is over $14,000, and a  student  starting  school  in  2007 will  save $2,360 over the life of his loan; a  student who starts school in 2011 will  save over $4,500 over the life of this  loan.  These are real savings put directly  into the pockets of people who need it  most, and I am proud that Democrats  have made it a priority to make college more affordable in this 110th Congress. This is the right first step. I  commend the Chairman and  I commend the leadership of the Democrats  here in the 110th Congress.  ",2007

98,54,2007-01-17,Mr. SIRES.," Madam Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief  Act, which cuts interest rates in half over the  next  five years  for undergraduate students  with subsidized loans. As a former teacher, I  understand how  important education  is  to  every child. It ensures that everyone has the  opportunity to succeed and to make the most  of their dreams.  Yet college is soaring out of reach for American  students. Today  the average  student  graduates with $17,500 in loan debt; almost  45 percent more than just 11 years ago. H.R.  5 makes a great first step in reducing the burden on students with these loans. In my home  state of New Jersey, the typical student loan  borrower will save approximately $4,600 over  the life of their loan because of this legislation.  Not only does this bill make college more  affordable, it does so without further increasing the nation’s debt. Specifically, this bill is  paid for by six modest reductions in various  subsidies to lenders and guaranty agencies.  I urge everyone to support making college  more affordable by voting in favor of this legislation.  ",2007
99,54,2007-01-17,Mr. WILSON of Ohio.," Madam Speaker,  Ohio students and their families are struggling.  In fact, Ohio ranks 49th in affordability of college.  Sadly, this is a barrier many hard-working  families cannot overcome. Bright young Ohioans are being shut out because college costs  too much.  Today, by cutting student loan rates in half,  we are opening up important opportunities for  thousands of young Ohioans and young people across the nation.  Just in the first two years, this bill will save  Ohio students an average of $2,230 and  in  four years $4,320.  We should ease the burden on our working  families. We should put our students in a position  to succeed  in school and beyond. This  bill, which cuts student loan rates, does just  that.  ",2007
100,54,2007-01-17,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker, I rise in  strong support of the College Student Relief  Act, which over the next five years will cut the  student  loan  interest  rate  in half  for undergraduate students with subsidized loans. And,  I  take exception  to  this Republican  rhetoric  about what  the Democrats could have done  under Republican domination.  Madam Speaker, Since 2001,  tuition and  fees have increased by 41 percent, after inflation, at  four-year public colleges and by 17  percent (after inflation) at four-year private colleges.  Now, we have a chance to act; otherwise financial barriers will prevent more than 4 million students  from attending a  four-year college and more than 2 million from attending  any college in the coming decade.  That would be a crisis for millions of hard-  working families—but it also would be a crisis  for our country’s ability to compete in the 21st  century economy.  In his article, ‘‘It’s a Flat World, After All,’’  Thomas Friedman argues that America’s historical  economic  advantages  have  disappeared because ‘‘the world is flat, and anyone with smarts; access  to Google; and, a  cheap wireless laptop can join the innovation  fray.’’ No matter where they live in the world.  This means we must  invest more  in our  most valuable resource—our people—and this  bill would do just that.  For example, this bill will save the average  student borrower who starts at a four-year college in California next year nearly $2,500 over  the life of a loan—and will save the same student who starts in 2011 nearly $5,000 over the  life of a loan.  Those savings are necessary to make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans  and in the life of our country as to success  over failure.  I urge my colleagues to join me in support  of this bill.  ",2007
101,54,2007-01-17,Mr. WELCH of Vermont.," Madam Speaker, I  am proud, as part of our first 100 hours, that  Congress has committed to expanding higher  education opportunities  to more Americans.  Education has always been the great equalizer  in  this country. With each generation  doors are opened through greater access to  education.  The health of our economy and prosperity of  our middle class  rests on having a highly-  skilled and well-educated workforce. We all  know stories of working class families struggling to make ends meet to put a child, sometimes the family’s first generation, through college.  It  is a struggle millions of  families go  through, as college costs skyrocket year after  year. Reducing the debt burden these families  and students face is the least Congress can  do  to help meet  their commitment and sacrifice.  H.R. 5 will provide a significant reduction in  student  loan  interest rates  for students who  borrow under the subsidized student loan program.  This legislation is worthy in its intent and it  is legislation I support. However, it is my hope  I  in  rise  to work with my fellow members and the distinguished Chairman of Education and Labor  to recognize the important role small, not-for-  profit lenders play in opening doors to more  working families. I believe it makes sense to  distinguish not only between large and small  lenders, but those that lend on a not-for-profit  basis and who reinvest all revenues into additional student financial assistance.  Our goal is to improve educational opportunities for students and it is a goal I know our  non-profit lenders share.  ",2007
102,54,2007-01-17,Ms. ESHOO.," Madam Speaker,  strong support of H.R. 5.  In today’s increasingly competitive economy,  a college education  is more  important  than  ever. That’s why it’s essential for us to ensure  that anyone who has the desire to receive a  higher education has the opportunity to do so.  Higher education shapes citizens as well as  the future of our country.  Today escalating college costs and legislation passed by  the Republican Majority  in  2006  are  creating  insurmountable  barriers  across the country for students to afford a college education. According  to  the Congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, financial obstacles will prevent  at least 4.4 million high school graduates from  attending a four-year public college over the  next decade. This is an inexcusable waste of  our most valuable resource, the young people  of our country.  H.R. 5 will lower these barriers, cutting interest rates in half over the next five years for  undergraduate students with subsidized student  loans. This  relief  is  targeted  to  reach  those most in need . . . students and families  making between $26,000 and $68,000. When  fully phased  in,  this  legislation will save  the  typical borrower in California with $15,125 in  subsidized federal student loan debt approximately $4,830 over the life of their loan. All  told, this legislation will provide students with  $5.5 billion  in  financial relief and  is entirely  paid for through adjustments in lender rates,  participation fees for financial institutions and  collection fees for defaulted loans.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in supporting  this  legislation. By doing so we will  take an important step to improve access to  higher education across the country as well as  helping to relieve the burden on middle class  families across the nation.  ",2007

110,61,2007-01-17,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker,  today  Representative WOOLSEY, Representative LEEand I introduced a bill that  would  conclude our  involvement  in  Iraq and bring our troops home. The  bill, H.R. 508, is entitled, Bring Our  Troops Home and Sovereignty of Iraq  Restoration Act of 2007. The bill has 16  original  cosponsors.  Representative  WOOLSEYwas on the floor a moment  ago, and she shared with you some of  the provisions of that bill.  I will reiterate, I will repeat, if enacted, the bill would repeal the use-of-  force authorization passed by Congress  in 2002 and requires a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops and contractors  hired by the U.S. Government within 6  months of the enactment of this bill.  The bill authorizes the President to  support an international stabilization  force in Iraq, if the Iraq government requests such a force, but U.S. troops  would not be permitted to participate  in the international force.  It would turn security activities and  military operations in Iraq over to the  elected  Iraqi  government within  6  months of the date of enactment.  It would prohibit the U.S. from establishing permanent bases in Iraq.  It would cap the number of officers  and employees of the United States assigned to the U.S. embassy in Iraq at  500.  It would accelerate the training and  equipping of Iraq military and security  forces, and pursue security and stability in Iraq through diplomacy.  It would provide assistance to the  Iraqi government  in  recovering cultural and historical artifacts that have  disappeared since the U.S. invaded in  2003.  It will do a number of other things,  but let me wrap this up by saying it  would fully fund veterans’ health care,  including mental health care, for our  returning veterans.  Mr. Speaker, I am spending an inordinate amount of time on this issue,  along with many of my other colleagues, and I have chosen to be a  major cosponsor on this bill because I  feel it is absolutely my responsibility  to not only articulate what is wrong  with this war, but to do everything  that I can to encourage the President  of the United States, the commander in  chief, to bring our troops home.  I think it is important to do this because we have lost over 3,000 American  soldiers. As a matter of fact, I think it  is about 3,034.  I look at the continuing devastation  in Iraq, and I see that just day before  yesterday I believe over 100 Iraqis were  killed and maybe twice as many was  injured and we lost four more American soldiers.  b1815  This has got to stop. We are in control. We can stop this. I am encouraging our Commander-in-Chief to bring  our troops home, and to pursue diplomacy, save lives. Because I believe if  they continue down the path that they  are going, we are going to have a real  blood bath in a short period of time.  This surge, this expansion of the war  that has been advocated and pursued  and pushed by this President is absolutely the wrong thing to do. I know  that he has been advised and he has accepted the advice that he is to go into  Sadr City and he is to confront al-Sadr,  who is the head of a tremendous militia. They have over 50,000 signed up in  that militia and more coming each  day. I don’t want our American soldiers to confront that militia. I don’t  want our American soldiers in the middle of this civil war. I don’t want these  young boys who come from our cities  and our towns and these young girls  who come from our villages and our  hamlets of America to be caught in between Sunnis and Shiites and Kurds.  They don’t know a Sunni from a Shiite. We don’t speak the language. We  haven’t trained people. Even the soldiers that are supposed to be embedded  doing the training can’t speak the language. They are depending on interpreters. And let me tell you, even some  of the soldiers that we are training in  Iraq are turning their backs on us.  They desert our soldiers in the middle  of a conflict, in a confrontation. These  are the ones that we are training, that  authorization  we are depending on to take over the  security of  Iraq somehow.  It  is not  going to happen.  We have to leave, and we should not  be deterred from the mission of leaving  because someone is going to accuse us  of cutting and running. We know how  these sound bites take place. We know  what people do when they want to promote  their  position.  They  will  mischaracterize what is being done. We  have got to have the courage to stand  up and stand up for our American soldiers.  I support and cosponsor this new bill.  I would ask my colleagues to support  it.  Today,  Representative WOOLSEY,  Representative LEEand I introduced a bill today  that would conclude our  involvement  in  Iraq  and bring our troops home.  The bill, H.R. 508 is titled ‘‘Bring the Troops  Home and Iraq Sovereignty Restoration Act of  2007.’’  The bill has 16 original cosponsors.  If enacted, the bill would:  Repeals  the  use  of  force  passed by Congress in 2002.  Requires  the complete withdrawal of U.S.  troops and contractors hired by the U.S. government within 6 months of the enactment of  this bill. The bill authorizes  the President  to  support an  international stabilization  force  in  Iraq, if the Iraqi government requests such a  force, but U.S. troops would not be permitted  to participate in the international force;  Turn security activities and military operations in Iraq over to the elected Iraqi government within 6 months of  the date of enactment.  Prohibit  the U.S.  nent bases in Iraq;  Cap the number of officers and employees  of the United States assigned to the U.S. embassy in Iraq at 500;  Accelerate  the  training and equipping of  Iraqi military and security forces;  Pursue security and stability in Iraq through  diplomacy;  Provide Iraqi government assistance in destroying/cleaning up  land mines, unexploded  ordnance and depleted uranium shells;  Provide assistance to the Iraqi government  in recovering cultural and historic artifacts that  have disappeared since  the U.S.  invaded  in  2003;  Provide compensation for Iraqi noncombatant civilian casualties—except for those individuals  that participated  in  the armed  insurgency after May 1, 2003; and  Fully  fund  veterans healthcare,  including  mental health care, for our returning veterans.  This bill stands in stark contrast to President  Bush’s proposal to send more than 20,000 additional troops to Iraq.  The President proposes more of the same,  while we provide a way to remove our troops  from the sectarian civil war in Iraq, return our  troops to their loved ones and begin the process of restoring our credibility throughout the  world.  from establishing permaf  EVEN THE SOLDIERS WILL TELL  YOU: ‘‘NOTHING’S GOING TO HELP’’  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  CARDOZA).

112,68,2007-01-17,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I  want to thank the leadership for allowing me to host this hour this evening,  an hour once again of  the Official  Truth Squad. The Official Truth Squad  is a group of individuals who got together almost 2 years ago now, and we  are somewhat frustrated and concerned  about the level of not just rancor here  in  Congress,  but  the  level  of  disinformation and the kind of information that was often being put forward in support of certain legislation  that, in fact, well, Mr. Speaker, just  wasn’t true.  So what we did is to get together,  primarily, a group of freshmen from  the last Congress and put in place this  Official Truth Squad. Our goal, our  purpose, is to raise the level of the  rhetoric, to be a little more positive  than is usually the case here in Washington, and to use facts. To use facts.  We have a number of favorite quotes,  but one we like to use frequently is one  from  former United States Senator  Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who kind of  crystallized what is a real concern here  in Washington,  because  everybody  throws around their own opinions. But  his quote was, ‘‘Everyone is entitled to  their own opinion but not their own  facts.’’  We think that it is extremely helpful  when we are talking about issues to  talk about facts, because if we are not  using facts to base the decisions we  make here in Washington, if we are not  using facts to reach the conclusions,  then it is very likely that we will not  reach the right conclusion.  I have said before, Mr. Speaker, that  in my former life I was a physician,  and I knew if I didn’t use facts and I  didn’t make the right diagnosis, it was  virtually impossible to formulate the  right treatment plan and then have the  patient get well. So we can look at  that as an analogy for what we are trying to do for our Nation, which is to  make the right diagnosis, to formulate  the right proposals and plans and policies and put them in place so that the  patient that is our Nation survives and  thrives and does well.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able  to have the opportunity once again tonight to host an hour of the Official  Truth Squad; and I will be joined by a  number of colleagues, and we will address two or three issues this evening.  We are going to start by talking about  what many  people  have  discussed  around the Nation, and it has kind of  captured the attention of many in the  media, Mr. Speaker, and that is this  issue of the 100-hour agenda that the  majority party, the Democrats, have.  It is curious to look at that for a variety of reasons, but we will look specifically at the amount of time and  kind of what they have been doing with  that 100 hours.  Secondly, we will  talk about  the  issue of student loans. It is a bill we  had here in Congress today, and we are  trying to have facts back up policy as  it relates to how best to provide appropriate loans for students who are trying to reach that American dream all  across this Nation.  Thirdly, we are going to talk a little  about energy policy, something that I  would suggest, Mr. Speaker, needs a lot  of facts brought to the table.  The common theme that I think people will appreciate if they are truly interested in looking objectively at these  three issues, and so many others here  in Congress, the common theme about  these three issues tonight, I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, is broken promises.  Broken promises.  In fact, when you look at these issues  independently, I think you will be able  to see as we go through them the broken promises that have occurred just  in these first 2 weeks in Congress.  And why is it important, Mr. Speaker, for promises to be kept? Well, you  know, we hear all the time from the  other side that people voted last November for a change. And they did vote  for a change; there is no doubt about  it. There were a lot of things we in the  majority could have done better. But  people across this Nation based their  votes upon information that they had.  They based their votes upon what they  were being told and what they were  being promised by the other side. So if  those promises aren’t kept, then that  is important.  It is important for a variety of reasons. One is that the policies that were  promoted and were espoused as being  the be-all and end-all for our Nation  aren’t being carried out by the majority party. But as important as that is,  Mr. Speaker, maybe even more important is the fact that when people go to  the polls and they vote, and they rely  on what Members of Congress who are  ultimately successful have told them  they were going to do, and then those  things aren’t done, all that does, Mr.  Speaker, is breed a cynicism and a disgust with our form of government and  our Representatives, and makes it so  that it is extremely difficult to move  forward in a positive direction for our  Nation.  I want to talk a little bit about the  100-hour clock, and then we will have  some others, I know, who will be interested in speaking about that. There has  been a lot of talk about this 100 hours,  this wonderful 100 hours in which the  Democrat majority was going to get all  these grand things done. And it was  promised,  it was promised,  this  100  hours.  Now, what we have seen over this period of time is that that 100 hours has  changed. Initially, the first 100 hours  was going to be, to quote the Speaker  on October 6, 2006, she said,  ‘‘In the  first 100 hours the House meets after  Democrats win control,’’ and then she  went on to describe what they were  going to do. The first 100 hours the  House meets after Democrats take control.  Then it soon morphed into, well, it  will be the first 100 legislative hours.  On December  1, after  the  election,  when they began looking at what they  were going to do and how they were  going to make it happen, they said, on  December 1, 2006, ‘‘In our first 100 legislative hours in office we have a bipartisan and an achievable plan.’’  Mr. Speaker, as you well know, that  kind of went by the wayside as well.  And when we called them on it, we said  what 100 hours is it, the new majority  leader, Mr. HOYER from Maryland, put  it best when he kind of talked about,  well, we will try to do it in 100 hours.  Maybe we will get it done, maybe we  won’t. But then he said, ‘‘It all depends  on how you are counting 100 hours.’’  And he is right. He is right. It all depends on how you are counting the 100  hours. If you have the desire to deceive  the American  people  and  turn  the  clock on and off whenever you want to,  then you get to about 33 hours, which  is what the Democrat clock tells us  they have taken.  This is our third week, Mr. Speaker,  our third week here. So what does that  mean? It means that we are working  about 10 hours a week. About 10 hours  a week. I think the American people  are working a whole lot more than 10  hours a week. A reasonable amount of  time, given that we have been sworn in  for about 14 days, 2 full weeks, a reasonable amount of time may be 80. And  that is about the sense of how many  hours we have in fact been in session.  As of 7 p.m. tonight, Mr. Speaker, we  will have been in session 81 hours and  53 minutes. So that is a reasonable estimate. But the total,  if you really  keep track of 100 hours, the total time  as of noon today was 336 hours. As of  noon today, 336 hours.  Now,  people may  say, well,  that  doesn’t make a whole lot of difference  what the time is. But, Mr. Speaker, it  does, because the promises were made  and the promises have been broken.  Again, as Mr. HOYER says, it all depends  on  how  you’re  counting  100  hours. Kind of reminds me of the quote  about the definition of ‘‘is,’’ doesn’t it,  Mr. Speaker?  We are  so pleased  to have many  members of our conference who want  to  take part  in  the Official Truth  Squad, and  tonight we have a new  friend to me and to our conference,  Congressman DAVID the gentleman from Tennessee, who is a freshman. This is his first term in Congress.  He began a small business, a very  successful  individual  back  in Tennessee, and he has great perception on  the processes of legislation because he,  like I, served 8 years in his State legislature.

114,75,2007-01-17,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker, it  is an honor to come before the House  once again.  As  you  know,  the  30-Something  Working Group, we come to the floor  to share not only with the Members  but also the American people the great  things that are happening here under  the Capitol dome and some things that  Members should be informed of that  could happen under the Capitol dome if  we were able to work in a bipartisan  way.  But  I am so happy, Mr. Speaker,  today because we are on  the  floor  today, and we have a number of issues  that we want to share with not only  Members but also the American people.  I am excited about all these bipartisan  votes that have been taking place over  the last 90-something-odd hours that  have taken place.  I am glad to have good friends from  all over the country. We are going to  have the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. ALTMIRE) that is going to join us,  and also  the gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. MURPHY) is going to join  us tonight.  I think it is important for us to really reflect on some of the things that  have been happening.  Mr. Speaker, if I may make an inquiry, how much time do we have, sir?  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  of Ohio). The gentleman  from  Florida has 58 minutes remaining.  ",2007
115,75,2007-01-17,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Thank you,  Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to verify  that time check there.  In the 58 minutes we have left, I just  want to talk about a few of the bipartisan votes, and  then we will  talk  about this whole 100-hours agenda.  I was having a conversation before I  came to the floor, and I was stopped by  one of the outstanding staffers that are  here. They said, Congressman, it is just  interesting to see Democrats and Republicans voting  together on major  issues for a change.  Today, Mr. Speaker, we had a vote on  the College Student Relief Act, and I  am proud to say that not only did we  have every Democratic Member that  was in attendance today voting for it,  but we also had 124 Republicans that  voted for it. This was to take the interest rates down from 6.8 to now 3.4, and  it is going to help 5.5 million students  be able to afford college.  But  I definitely  love  for my colleagues to chime in, because this is a  good day of accomplishment whenever  you can come to the floor and vote and  be successful on something that you  talk about when you are running for  office; and now to see this legislative  accomplishment in such a very short  RYAN time is something that you should be  excited about. I know that all our constituents are, too.  ",2007

119,75,2007-01-17,Ms. WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ.,"  I know that because as a candidate  for office and as a student of American  politics I have had the honor of watching you stand here and really speak for  the American people,  for the  last 4  years in your case, Mr. MEEK, and for  the three of you, for the last 2 years. I  have been able to serve in the State  legislature and now obviously have just  a unique opportunity to be here and advocate on behalf of those people with  all of you.  If I could start by saying a tremendous and unconditional thank-you to  what you have been able to do. Those  of us in the political world and nonpolitical world sometimes do not get to  turn on the TV until late at night. I  will tell you, and speaking especially  for a lot of the younger people in the  State that I am from, Connecticut, who  are interested in this process either as  their profession or simply as an interested American, the work that you  have done in talking about the agenda  that was so badly needed, that was reaffirmed by the American people this  November, made a difference, made a  difference for me. I think I stole a lot  of your lines over the course of my  work this last fall.  So let me just say, by means of introduction, that it is a privilege to be able  the stand here with you as a new member of the 30 Something Caucus. There  are a few of us that came down here,  and I think that speaks to the agenda  that you have put forth that said the  American people need change. We need  change.  We especially heard it in our generation those of us who are looking at not  just the next 10 years, but the next 20,  30, 40 years and want to make sure that  things are happening here  in Washington, D.C., whether they be on the  100-hours agenda or whatever we do for  the next 2 years is looking to the future of our children and grandchildren,  and  that’s what  the  30 Somethings  have been all about.  ",2007
120,75,2007-01-17,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," While we were  down here, you were probably running  through bingo halls and bowling alleys;  and Mr. ALTMIRE, who is just across  the border from me in western Pennsylvania, I think the impact that you  have already had on Congress, you  have all spoken on the floor. You all  did and have done numerous press  events representing our party, and I  think you have done a tremendous job.  So it is good to have you here with certain expertise, whether  it  is health  care or labor, whatever the issue may  be. We have got a very talented freshman class.  The reason we are still down here and  we just did not quit when the elections  were over is that this is about more  than just the 100 hours, and we are  going to hammer this 100 hours home  and get it through and do what the  American people asked us to do. But  kind of the new energy and spirit that  you guys bring is going to move us well  past that 100 hours into something that  is going to be very special.  So I would be happy to yield over to  my  friend  from Pennsylvania  right  across the border, the same media market.  ",2007
121,75,2007-01-17,Mr. ALTMIRE.," Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk about what we did today. We  have had a fantastic couple of weeks  with the 100 hours, and we are going to  talk a lot about that, but today specifically we did something that is going to  impact just about every American with  children in this country. We cut the interest rate on student loans in half.  And currently  interest rates are 6.8  percent; we are going to cut them down  to 3.4 percent, and that is going to have  an  impact on people all across the  country.  I wanted to take a  few moments  today and talk about what this is going  to do for students in my district and  for the impact per college in my district.  I have a college called LaRoche College where I served on the board of  trustees for two terms. It is in my district. It is a private liberal arts college,  and for students who are entering this  year, over the lifetime of their loan,  they are going to see savings of $2,120  over the time of this loan. And because  this is phased in over 5 years, for students in 2011, for those parents who  may have children that are going to  enter college in 2011, over the lifetime  of their college, if they go to LaRoche  College, they are going to save over  $4,000. On average across the country,  it is over $4,500, and I think that is  something we can be proud of in this  House of Representatives.  ",2007
122,75,2007-01-17,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," I just want to  make a point, and we try to distinguish  our party from what the previous party  has done in that we are getting some  feedback from the other side, that we  are phasing this thing in and it is not  immediate, and we are not doing everything that we could possibly be doing.  We are doing a heck of a lot more than  they have done. We have done more in  the last 3 hours today on the House  floor than they have done in the previous 14 years in running this place for  average students.  So we are not going to take it. We  are doing more than they have done,  and you know what, if they did not  have us at a $400 billion deficit, we  would be doing a heck of a lot more.  The only constraints we have are the  fiscal mess that they left us.  ",2007
123,75,2007-01-17,Mr. ALTMIRE.," I would say to that  criticism, and we all heard it today on  the other side, that there is an immediate reduction.

124,82,2007-01-17,Mr. GILCHREST.," I have sort of a  summary,  I guess you could say, a  Global  Warming  101  Introductory,  which will take about 10 minutes, so I  am not sure how you want to proceed.  Do you want me to just give this sort  of a 10-minute introduction to global  warming, or break it up with your dialogue?  ",2007
125,82,2007-01-17,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland., I think  that would be very instructive for our  audience. Please do.  ,2007
126,82,2007-01-17,Mr.  GILCHREST.,"  Congressman  is talking about peak oil,  the idea that our energy from oil is a  finite resource, it is limited. And what  I would like to do, in conjunction with  that, is to give a perspective on one of  the legacies of the age of oil, and that  is global warming, heating the planet,  upsetting  that  delicate  balance  between what the Earth has been used to  for thousands of years, and the natural  range of fluctuation in the climate, to  what we have done in less than 100  years as a result of burning fossil fuel,  oil in particular.  So here is how I would like to proceed. Number one, the Earth has a livable climate. The biosphere, which is  the area of the planet that contains life  forms that we have become familiar  with is possible because of something  called the greenhouse effect.  Now, in our atmosphere, we have oxygen, water vapor, methane, carbon dioxide, a number of different chemical  mixes which provide us with the air we  breathe and the type of atmosphere  that produces, in part, the climate that  we have, hence the greenhouse effect.  It is warm enough and cool enough for  life, as we know it, to exist.  Now,  one  of  the most  important  greenhouse gases, other  than water  vapor, other than oxygen, other than  methane—all of these contribute to the  BARTLETT greenhouse effect—is carbon dioxide, or  CO2.  Now, even though carbon dioxide is  less than 1 percent of the makeup of  our atmosphere, it is critical in the  heat balance of our planet. Now, that  sort of gives us an idea of the importance of these greenhouse gases and  the importance of carbon dioxide.  Now, is the Earth warming? There is  no question, everybody would say yes,  the Earth is warming, and it has been  warming for the last 10,000 years. It has  been warming for the last 10,000 years  because that was the end of the Ice Age  10,000 years ago, and sea level has been  rising, and the planet has been warming all of that time.  b2100  It is warming, in part, because there  is an increase in carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere. Ten thousand years ago,  and you can evaluate this by looking  at ice cores and checking the bubbles  out, and see what the content in our  atmosphere of CO2was by looking at  those bubbles in ice cores from Greenland or the Antarctic, and CO2was  about 180 parts per million in the atmosphere  10,000  years  ago. CO2,  a  greenhouse effect, or a greenhouse gas,  was at 180 parts per million 10,000 years  ago.  If we move  forward almost  10,000  years to the year 1890, in 1890, CO2 in  the atmosphere was 280 parts per million. It took just about 10,000 years for  CO2, a greenhouse gas, which helps the  balance of Earth’s climate, it took almost 10,000 years for it to increase almost 100 parts per million.  Now, let us look at the year 2000. In  the year 2000, CO2was 380 parts per million. In effect, the natural causes before the Industrial Age were really in  full swing. The natural causes gradually warmed  the planet over  10,000  years very slowly.  What we have seen in the last 100  years, actually, about the last 50 years,  is a dramatic increase in the amount of  carbon  dioxide  in  the  atmosphere,  something like we have not seen for  hundreds of thousands of years and perhaps millions of years. So CO2 in the  atmosphere right now is 380 parts per  million. We haven’t seen that much  CO2in the atmosphere for 800,000 years.  Now, as a result of this, we are going to  see some changes in our climate.  Let me make  this  last comment,  though, about CO2 in the atmosphere,  about the heat balance, about how the  greenhouse gases intermix with the atmosphere. Human  activity,  burning  fossil fuel, has put into the atmosphere  in a little more than 50 years what the  natural processes took out of the atmosphere, and it took more than millions of years to effect. In less than 100  years we have changed the atmosphere  more than the natural processes of the  Earth have changed the atmosphere in  millions of years.  Now, what are the ramifications of  this? Well, warmer seas and warmer  temperatures.

127,89,2007-01-17,Mr. INSLEE.," I was talking to a businessman the other day who wants to  develop  the Chinese market  to  sell  China thin solar film technology to become the distributor  in China of a  technology developed in America. Talk  about a great thing for our balance of  payments.  You talked about the original Apollo  project. We have named our bill, the  first step we will talk about tomorrow,  the New Apollo Energy Project because  we believe, as John F. Kennedy did,  that we have unlimited innovative capacity. But what we don’t have at the  moment are policies to put that innovative genius to work.  For instance, we are spending less  than 16 percent on energy research in  total  in  this country. We are only  spending 16 percent of what we spent  on the Apollo project. That  is  just  abysmal. We had at least as much of a  challenge as trying to get to the Moon.  I had a utility executive in my office  today. He told me this  factoid: We  spend more on research about dog food  than the utility industry does on new  energy in this country. I don’t want to  belittle dog food, it is important, but  we need to boost our research. Tomorrow we will put $14 billion back into  the pockets of Americans to use in part  for  research,  the  tremendous  things  that are going on.

128,89,2007-01-17,Mr. HALL.,"  Mr. HALL of New York. I am just  looking at the uses of the Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve, and I will get that out in one  sentence, to accelerate the use of clean  domestic renewable energy resources  and alternative fuels, to promote the  utilization of energy efficient products  and practices and conservation, and to  increase research development and deployment of clean, renewable energy  and  energy  efficiencies  and  technologies.  The word ‘‘conservation’’ is in there,  and it is one that has been sadly neglected. In fact, it was unfortunate a  few years ago when our Vice President  said conservation may be a personal  virtue, but it is no way to build a national energy policy. I completely disagree. I think it is one of the most important ways to start building a national energy policy, and I was happy  Mr.  earlier was  talking  about energy efficiency. It is time all  of us on both sides of the aisle did that  and put our money where those words  are.  BARTLETT I see these pet peeves of mine as I go  through every day life. For instance,  walking down the aisle of the supermarket, in the Northeast, I can walk  through Hanford’s A&P  or Stop &  Shop, and there are aisle after aisle of  cold  cases with yogurt or beer or  cheese that is being kept cold by a refrigerator and a compressor running all  of the time, and an open top so it is  convenient. I can just reach in. But  there is no door or plastic sheet to  keep the cold air in and the warm air  out. Meanwhile, because we live in the  northern part of the country, half of  the year there is a furnace going to  keep the shoppers warm and the furnace and the compressor are working  at cross purposes. That is the kind of  blindness we have gotten used to, that  energy  is  something we  can  throw  away.  ",2007
129,89,2007-01-17,Mr. INSLEE.," There is so much good  work going in to stop those things that  you are talking about. To mention two  instances of  success on energy efficiency, I was talking to the Vice President of Dow Chemical yesterday. Dow  Chemical historically has not  been  looked at as a company on the forefront  on  environmental  issues,  but  they got a star last year for their energy efficiency program.  They have saved 42 percent of their  energy since 1990. They have reduced  their energy since 2000 by 22 percent by  just adopting commonsense measures,  some of which you might have talked  about, by having energy efficient appliances and lighting, by looking at how  they monitor the energy in their building. So a 42 percent reduction of their  energy usage, and they did that because it is good business, not because it  is some granola-crunching idea. They  did it because it is good business. And  we will create a fund tomorrow to help  businesses  and  individuals  go  down  that road.  Second accomplishment, California.  California has essentially, while the  average American uses 50 percent more  electricity than they did 10 years ago,  50 percent, California has been stable  for the last 10 years. They have not  gone up one kilowatt hour. And the  way they did that was to help people  invest in energy efficient light bulbs,  energy  efficient windows and appliances. As a result, they use 8,000 kilowatt hours per person per year, and the  average person uses 14,000 kilowatts.  Does that mean people in California  are living in the stone age? They are  still taking hot tubs in Marin County  and still putting out movies in Hollywood. They are living a good life there,  and their economy  is booming. But  they  are  doing  some  commonsense  things with energy. That is what we  are going to start tomorrow.  Mr. HALL of New York.

132,124,2007-01-17,Mr. REID.," I can give you this assurance: I will do everything I can to get  this to conference. I have not discussed  this with the distinguished Speaker or  anyone over there, but I will be happy  to work to see that that is done. As the  distinguished Senator knows,  I will  work to get it to conference, but as we  have learned—and if we get it to conference, it will be a public conference.  It will be one where Democrats will be  there and Republicans will be there  from both the House and the Senate.  But as you know, we have more votes  than you have, so I can’t guarantee  what would happen in conference. But I  will do everything I can to get it to  conference.  ",2007
133,124,2007-01-17,Mr. GREGG.," If the leader would yield  further, I don’t think this should be  characterized  as  an  amendment  to  bring down the bill. That is sort of a  unilateral authority of the leader, of  course. But it is certainly not my intention with this amendment, nor was  it my intention with this amendment.  I simply want to move this item along.  I think this is an appropriate vehicle.  But it sounds to me as if there might  be a framework here for some progress.  I will leave it to the good leaders to  discuss this.  ",2007
134,124,2007-01-17,Mr. REID.," I want the record to reflect that the Senator from New Hampshire offered this—and I said this in my  remarks—because he believes  in  it.  This is something he believes in. It was  not offered by the Senator from New  Hampshire to bring down the bill. But  that is what is happening. I am sorry  to say there are other Senators who see  this as an opportunity to bring down  the bill. I would hope we can work  something out on this. I want to move  forward on this legislation. I want the  Senator from New Hampshire to move  forward on his legislation.  As the Senator from New Hampshire  knows, I don’t agree with your legislation. But I will work, as I have indicated before to whoever  is watching  this Senate proceeding, to do everything I can to get a conference and  have an open public conference. If we  pass something here, of course.  ",2007
135,124,2007-01-17,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from California.  ,2007
136,124,2007-01-17,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  want to point out, I was on the floor  when this item was discussed, when the  Senator from New Hampshire offered  his line-item veto amendment. I was  also on the floor when Senator CONRAD,  who is our side’s budget expert, came  forward and debated it.  There was a rather fulsome debate. I  want to recount what Senator CONRAD  said about his belief about the amendment, that not only does it raise serious  constitutional  concerns,  but  it  would allow the President to unilaterally block enacted  funding, even  if  Congress rejects a proposed rescission.  In addition, rather than strengthening  fiscal discipline, the amendment could  lead to more spending, not  less. He  pointed out how it could be used to  eliminate entire new programs or improvements to benefits such as Medicare and Social Security. The President would have a year after a bill’s enactment to propose a rescission. The  President could package rescissions as  he or she wishes and could combine rescissions that have been enacted in several different pieces of legislation. Senators would be forced to vote on the  package with  little opportunity  for  public notice or input and no opportunity to offer amendments, nor would  there be any opportunity to filibuster  proposed rescissions. The new power  would make it much easier for a President to eliminate new Medicare or Social Security benefits to which he objects.  Now, I agree very much with what  the majority leader said. This is a very  problematic amendment.  It was debated on the floor of the Senate. It  needs further refinement if anybody is  going to move ahead with it. Clearly, it  is a major amendment. Clearly, it is a  real problem for our side. But for the  minority to take down the bill over  this amendment when the amendment  is not germane to the bill, when I have  tried very hard to keep matters that  are not within the scope of the bill off  the bill, including a matter I myself  very much wanted to present, I think  makes no sense.  The minority leader pointed out that  this bill passed before, 2 years ago, by  a vote of 90 to 8. The whole point of  this legislation is to show that the two  sides can come together, be bipartisan,  and enact a bill that will bring about  ethics, lobbying, and earmark reform.  And we have done that.  As Senator BENNETT,  the  ranking  member, and I have sat on this floor,  there has been ample time for Members  to bring their amendments to the floor.  I assure you that there has been a lot  of time when we have just sat here in  a quorum call. To allow this bill to be  pulled down at this time is just a special matter of some kind of pique, when  we  know  that  the  line-item  veto  amendment is extraordinarily problematic and deserves another venue, deserves more scrutiny, and should take  some time before it is passed in any  way, shape, or form.  So I am fully in support of what the  majority leader had to say. It makes  no sense  for the other side to take  down this bill over it. I hope the proposal made by the majority leader will  be accepted. I believe he will keep his  word. I will help in any way I possibly  can to see that that is, in fact, the  case. But we are so close to getting  this bill done, and it has some momentous things in it that represent a total  change of the way these bodies operate,  and they are  important, significant,  and timely. We ought to pass this bill.  We ought to show the American people  that we can work  together, Republicans and Democrats, for a common  purpose. So I just want to say that  after a week and a half, I am profoundly  disappointed  that  this  has  come about. I really thought we were  going to be able to work together and  pass a strong, bipartisan bill. And, in  fact, most of the amendments have  passed by huge majorities.  I  think  there have only been two that have  been relatively close.  I urge the Republican side to reconsider. There are so many positive elements of this bill, and the American  people will be so shortchanged if we  cannot solve whatever problem there is  between us and pass a bill that we  voted on 90 to 8 some time ago, which  has even been strengthened by some of  the eight members who voted against  it because they didn’t think  it was  strong enough. This is a very strong  measure.  Those of us who will work in conference will work to smooth out any  bumps. We will work in an open way,  and no side will be shut out of the conference. I pledge it will be a collegial  conference. This is our opportunity to  set an agenda for the 110th Congress.  Please, please, please, let us not reject  this.  I yield the floor.  ",2007

138,124,2007-01-17,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, we have  been working for a week and a half on  this bill, S. 1, which is the highest priority of the Democratic majority  in  the new Congress because we believe,  as  it  says, providing greater  transparency in the legislative process is a  starting point. Trying to restore public  confidence in the way we work here is  a starting point.  I was heartened by the fact that this  bill, as well as the substitute amendment and other amendments offered,  has  largely been bipartisan. Most of  the debate has been bipartisan in nature. With few exceptions, the rollcalls  have been bipartisan. It troubles me  that we have reached this procedural  impasse with the minority that, with  the power given to it in the Senate, is  threatening to bring down this bill. I  am searching my mind to understand  why they would want to bring down a  bill that would clean up this culture of  corruption  in Washington and make  substantial ethical changes.  I have come to the conclusion that it  has to do with indigestion. What I am  referring to is this: For every decision  in political life there is usually a good  reason and a real reason.

139,131,2007-01-17,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the  quorum call be rescinded.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.  CASEY). Without objection, it is so ordered.  ",2007
140,131,2007-01-17,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, to bring everyone up to date as to where we are, I  made a good-faith offer to the minority  that we will put the line-item veto off  to another day. Senator BYRDwas not  agreeable to that. I talked to Senator  BYRDon more than one occasion this  evening, the last time for a significant  amount of time, and he simply believes  this line-item veto is a matter of great  constitutional import, that for us to  agree at this time to debate this would  be wrong and that he simply will not  do that.  Having said that, I still say I think it  is a terribly unfortunate day for this  Senate that a bipartisan piece of legislation dealing with ethics and lobbying  reform that has been cosponsored for  the first time in three decades as the  first bill brought before the Senate by  the two leaders, Democratic and Republican leader, is not going to be allowed to go forward based on the Republicans not being able to have a vote  on a matter that is not germane or relevant to this legislation.  We have done so much with this legislation. We introduced the bill that  passed this Senate last year by a vote  of 98. We strengthened that significantly with the substitute. A number  of amendments were offered by my Republican  colleagues  and Democratic  colleagues. There are those who say  that Senators thought those amendments would not be agreed to. They  have been agreed to, with rare exception.  We have 15 or so amendments that  would be postcloture germane on the  substitute if cloture were invoked. We  have agreed those amendments should  go forward.  The point I am making is it is too  bad that  it appears this bill  is not  going to pass because of a line-item  veto. That is what it is all about. Members can talk about things in here that  may apply, and the Parliamentarian  says it is not germane. To think we can  dispose of this piece of legislation in a  few minutes  is not sensible. This  is  something that will take a lot of debate. Senator CONRAD, alone, would  take a number of hours. Senator BYRD  would take a number of hours. Senator  LEVIN, who is one of the plaintiffs taking this to the Supreme Court, would  take a significant amount of time.  I hope my friends on the other side of  the aisle would reconsider. After what  has gone on  in Washington,  in  the  courts alone, this requires our doing  something. We,  in good  faith, have  moved forward on this, playing by the  Senate rules. I hope people of good will  on the other side of the aisle vote to invoke cloture. If not, as I said earlier  today, there is only one reason this bill  is going to not pass. It is because the  minority does not want it to pass, period, underscore, exclamation point.  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous  consent  that  the Lott  amendments  Nos. 78 and 79 be withdrawn, that at 9  o’clock  p.m.  tonight  all  time  postcloture be yielded back, and without further intervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to vote in relation  to  the  following:  Feingold  amendment No.  65; Bennett amendment No. 81, as modified; Reid amendment No. 4, as amended, if amended;  motion to invoke cloture on the Reid  substitute amendment; provided  further that there be 2 minutes of debate  equally divided between each vote.

141,131,2007-01-17,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I might say  in response to my good friend, the majority  leader, there  is no particular  reason these votes could not be held in  the morning. It is clear we are at an  impasse. That  frequently happens  in  the Senate. It is not at all unusual. It  is also not at all unusual to have nongermane amendments offered on bills.  They are offered on virtually every bill  that goes through the Senate. So there  is nothing extraordinary happening on  this bill that we do not see in the Senate with great repetition on bill after  bill after bill after bill.  We have been working in good faith  to reach an agreement with respect to  Senator GREGG’s amendment on enhanced rescission. I wish to thank the  Senator from New Hampshire for his  patience in that regard. He was here  early on this bill. He offered it a week  ago—it has now been pending for an entire week—and is prepared for a vote.  Now, the majority leader, to his credit, was attempting to reach an agreement to allow for a vote on this issue  at a later date. He mentioned it needed  to be sufficiently debated.

142,159,2007-01-17,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President,  I rise  today along with my distinguished colleagues,  Senator  Senator  BUNNING, Senator INOUYE, and Senator  DURBIN, to introduce the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act  in  order to protect and preserve the Nation’s important fossil record for the  benefit of our citizens. Vertebrate fossils are rare and important natural resources that have become increasingly  endangered due to an increase in the illegal collection of fossil specimens for  commercial sale. However, at this time  there is no unified policy regarding the  treatment of  fossils by Federal  land  management  agencies which would  help protect and conserve fossil specimens. Consequently, we risk the deterioration or loss of these valuable scientific resources. This Act will correct  that omission by providing uniformity  to the patchwork of statutes and regulations that currently exist. By creating a comprehensive national policy  for preserving and managing paleontological resources  found on Federal  land, this Act will also be instrumental  in curtailing and preventing future illegal trade thereby ensuring that many  generations to come will have access to  these invaluable records of our past. I  would like to emphasize that this bill  covers only paleontological remains on  Federal lands and in no way affects archaeological  or  cultural  resources  under  the Archaeological Resources  Protection Act of 1979 or the Native  American Graves Protection and Rehabilitation Act.  I would also mention that this bill is  exactly the same bill that I introduced  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:14 Jan 18, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A17JA6.044 S17JAPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 7 C P 1 D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007
143,180,2007-01-17,Mr. SHUSTER.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to highlight an American success story,  an  inspirational Pennsylvanian and a great  American, Joe Hardy, III. Joe Hardy is the embodiment of the idea that, as Winston Churchill said, ‘‘We make a living by what we get and  we make a life by what we give.’’ This month  marks Joe Hardy’s 84th birthday and it is only  right  that his achievements  in business and  his contributions  to society be celebrated  in  this, the people’s House.  Joe Hardy  is perhaps best known as  the  founder of 84 Lumber,  the  largest privately  owned building materials supplier  to professional contractors in America. But he is much  more than this. He is a self-made man, a civic  leader and a great philanthropist. He  is  the  embodiment of the American Dream and his  story continues  to encourage  those around  him.  With 84 Lumber, Joe Hardy reached a level  in business that thousands of smaller entrepreneurs aspire to reach for themselves. And  like many Americans  just starting out  in  the  world of business, Joe Hardy did not inherit  his success; he built it from the ground up. His  is a true American success story, a story that  is alive and well today.  When Joe Hardy graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in engineering  he  joined his  family’s  jewelry company. He  demonstrated his business acumen early, and  quickly became the company’s best salesman.  But Joe Hardy wanted to make his own name  in the business world, so in 1952, with his own  savings and  the help of some  friends, he  opened a cash-and-carry lumber yard for contractors in the town of Eighty-Four, Pennsylvania.  In 1956 he changed his company’s  name from Green Hills Lumber to 84 Lumber  and the rest, as they say, is history.  84 Lumber grew quickly, reaching $84 million in sales in 1971 and $1 billion in sales in  1996. As his company and his fortune grew,  Joe Hardy began to give back to the communities that had given him the chance to succeed. In 1987, he bought the Nemacolin Resort in a bankruptcy sale and turned it into a  major economic draw and  tourist destination  for Western Pennsylvania.  He brought a PGA tournament to the world  class Nemacolin Resort that not only drew attention to the area, but raised money for worthy causes. The list of philanthropic achievements in this area is long, but a few examples  stand out.  Over  the past 15 years, Joe Hardy’s 84  Lumber Golf Tournaments have raised over  $1 million for the Westmoreland-Fayette Boy  Scout Council. He organized a PGA Tour  event from 2003 to 2006 that raised more than  $6 million for local charities and $1.3 million  for  Hurricane  Katrina  relief.  Additionally,  through his long collaboration with Habitat for  Humanity, Joe Hardy enabled the funding and  construction of 50 homes along the hurricane  ravaged Gulf Coast.  But his philanthropy does not end there. In  1990, Joe Hardy gave a grant to Washington  and Jefferson College  to start an Entrepreneurial Spirit Studies Program as well as a  scholarship  fund  its participation. This celebrated program continues to train tomorrow’s  business leaders today.  In addition  to philanthropy, Joe Hardy  is  also civically engaged. He continues to serve  as a County Commissioner for Fayette County  Pennsylvania and personally invested his own  money into the revitalization of Uniontown, the  hometown of General George C. Marshall.  The list of Joe Hardy’s accomplishments is  simply too long to cover here. However, to the  people of Fayette County, the contributions he  has made to their lives are evident everyday.  Whether you walk down the streets of a revitalized Uniontown, enjoy a jump in business  due to the Nemacolin Woodlands Resort, or  build your new house with 84 Lumber products, Joe Hardy’s impact is there.  I want to wish Joe Hardy a happy 84th birthday and  thank him  for all he has done  throughout his life. With his achievements and  outlook on life, I am sure we will see many  more successes in the years ahead.  f  HONORING THE CAREER OF BILL  SMITH  HON. BART GORDON  OFTENNESSEE  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 17, 2007  ",2007
144,180,2007-01-17,Mr.  GORDON  of  Tennessee.,"  Madam  Speaker, I rise today to honor the banking career of Bill Smith, who, as he puts it, started  out as an errand runner and left as chairman  of the board.  Bill began working  for  the Bank of Commerce in Woodbury, Tennessee, in 1950. At  the  time,  there were  five other employees  working at the bank on the west side of the  Cannon County Square. He began as a runner and went on to fill many other positions at  the bank, including using a pen and ledger to  keep the balance of the entire bank.  In 1954, the bank moved to its current location on the north side of the square, and Bill  continued moving up. In 1964, an addition was  added to the bank, and Bill earned the title of  vice president.  In 1967, the Bank of Commerce was sold to  Third National Bank, and Bill became president.  Another  addition  to  the Woodbury  branch was added in 1982. Under Bill’s leadership, the Bank of Commerce sponsored the  Cannon County Good Ole Days for 25 years  and started  the annual Red Apple Days  in  Auburntown. Bank branches were built and  obtained  in  the Edgefield community and  in  Auburntown.  When the bank sold in the early 1980s, it  had grown to about 50 full-time and 20 part-  time employees. The bank sold again in 1991  to Regions, and Bill’s son, Steve, who had  begun working  for  the bank while attending  Middle Tennessee State University, became  president. Bill became chairman of the board  until he retired from the banking industry on  August 31, 2005.  In his so-called  retirement, Bill has been  helping his son, Mike, with their family business, Smith Funeral Home, and managing his  family  farm. He  is an active member of  the  Church of Christ.  Christine Dillon, who has worked with Bill  since 1951, both at the bank and the funeral  home, says Bill  is described by  friends as  kind,  friendly, a good Christian and a great  marketing person. He  is much  loved by his  friends and former banking colleagues. I congratulate Bill on his retirement, and I wish him  many years of happiness.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE HAITIAN  PROTECTION ACT OF 2007  HON. ALCEE L.

This  important piece of  legislation would  designate Haitian  nationals  as  eligible  for  Temporary Protected Status (TPS),  The creation of TPS was intended to serve  as the statutory embodiment of safe haven for  those who are fleeing—or reluctant to return  to—a potentially dangerous situation  in  their  country of origin.  According to section 244A of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990, TPS may be  granted when: there is ongoing armed conflict  posing a serious threat to personal safety; it is  requested by a foreign state that temporarily  cannot handle the return of nationals due to  environmental disaster; or extraordinary and  temporary conditions  in a  foreign state exist  which prevent aliens from returning.

146,187,2007-01-17,Mr.  ISRAEL.," Mr. Speaker, on September  11th, 2001, my congressional district lost well  over one hundred people; and tens of thousands of lives were shattered.  So it is on their behalf that I rise today and  support passage of this bill, to implement the  recommendations of the bipartisan 9–11 Commission.  I am grateful that the first bill to be passed  in the first hours of a new majority is this one.  Because America can’t afford to wait another  minute. We’ve had 51⁄2 years of excuses,  delays, postponements and  lobbying. That’s  51⁄2years too long.  Even  today, Mr. Speaker,  there are some  who doubt we can meet  the deadlines  to  screen air cargo in 3 years and shipping cargo  in 5 years.  Mr. Speaker, America’s greatest  triumphs  were not achieved by saying ‘‘it’s too hard.’’  They were secured by refusing to take no for  an answer.  In  1962,  5  years  after  Sputnik  was  launched, John F. Kennedy said, ‘‘By the end  of the decade we will land on the moon.’’  In 2007, over 5 years after 9–11, we are  saying,  ‘‘by  the end of  the decade we will  screen all air cargo on our planes.’’  If we could research, develop, engineer and  build the systems that lifted people into space,  out of orbit, propel  them  to  the moon,  land  them on the moon, bring them back to their  capsule,  return  to earth, survive a  fiery  re-  entry and deposit them safely in the ocean—  then we should be able to figure out how to  screen air cargo in a way that minimizes risk  and  inconvenience  to people who get on  planes.  Mr. Speaker, when  it came  to securing  America’s place in the world, President Kennedy didn’t say ‘‘I wish we could land a man  on the moon but it’s not easy enough, so instead we’ll send a bus to Des Moines.’’  Mr. Speaker, when  it came  to preserving  our  national  survival, President Roosevelt  didn’t say, ‘‘Yesterday was a day of infamy, so  let’s spend 51⁄2years figuring out how to respond with  the  least  inconvenience  to  the  American people.’’  Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the safety  and security of my constituents, there can be  no more excuses, no further delay, no higher  priority.  And  to  those who disagree with me, who  earnestly and honorably believe we must continue to study feasibility and practicalities, I will  share other words of President Kennedy, from  that same speech when he told America we  would go to the moon:  We choose to go the moon in this decade  and do the other things, not because they are  easy, but because they are hard, because  that goal will serve to organize and measure  the best of our energies and skills, because  that challenge is one that we are willing to  accept, one we are unwilling to postpone,  and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.  HON. NEIL ABERCROMBIE  OFHAWAII  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 17, 2007  ",2007
147,187,2007-01-17,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to introduce a bill which is a companion  measure to legislation introduced by Senator  DANIELAKAKA in the Senate this morning. This  measure is called the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2007. The purpose of the bill is to provide a process for the  reorganization of  the Native Hawaiian governing entity  for  the purposes of a  federally  recognized  government-to-government  relationship.  On this day 114 years ago, the monarchy of  the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown by  agents of the United States. This injustice created wounds and issues that have never been  healed or resolved. Fourteen years ago, the  United States government took a step toward  reconciling  this part of history by passing a  resolution which acknowledged the overthrow  of the Kingdom of Hawaii and offered an apology to Native Hawaiians.  The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act would  take another step  in  the  reconciliation process by providing Native Hawaiians the same right of self-governance and  self-determination that are afforded to other indigenous peoples. Since Hawaii was annexed  as a territory, the United States has treated  Native Hawaiians in a manner similar to that  of American Indians and Alaska Natives. This  bill would formalize that relationship and establish parity in federal policies towards all of  our indigenous peoples.  This bill will also provide a structured process to address the longstanding issues resulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. This discussion has been avoided for far  too long because no one has known how to  address or deal with the emotions that arise  when these matters are discussed. There has  been no structured process. Instead, there has  been fear as to what the discussion would entail, causing people to avoid the issues. Such  behavior has led to high levels of anger and  frustration, as well as misunderstandings between Native Hawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians.  The bill provides a structured process to negotiate and resolve these issues with the federal and state governments and will alleviate  the growing mistrust, misunderstanding, anger,  and frustration about these matters.  This measure is supported by Hawaii’s Governor, Linda Lingle, Hawaii’s Congressional  delegation, and the Hawaii State Legislature.  The bill is also supported by a number of organizations in Hawaii who have passed resolutions in support of enacting this bill.  I ask my colleagues to support this measure  and advance the reconciliation process for our  people.

151,6,2007-01-24,Mr. SERRANO.," Reclaiming my time,  that is a great suggestion. I am sorry  that you didn’t do it for the last 12  years.  ",2007
152,6,2007-01-24,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, at this  time I am very happy to yield 2 minutes to a very hardworking Member of  Congress, our friend from Georgia, Dr.  PRICE.  (Mr. PRICE of Georgia asked and was  given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2007
153,6,2007-01-24,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman for yielding on  this extremely important issue. I, too,  rise with great respect for the individuals who are Delegates and our Resident Commissioner.  I also want  to  make it certain that I state up front  that we commend all of the men and  women who fight our battle in this war  on terror with the recognition and appreciation that those men and women  serve in a voluntary capacity, and our  hearts and prayers go out to them and  their families.  I  do want  to  say, however, Mr.  Speaker, that this process is a remarkable abuse of power. I oppose the rule  and the underlying bill on the basis of  both process and policy, which I believe  to be flawed, and also because it is remarkably unconstitutional.  I am oftentimes  reminded of  the  Lewis Carroll book, and sometimes I  feel that way: Just because you say it  is so doesn’t make it so.  Individuals who promote what we are  doing right now believe, in fact, that  they can just make up rules at a whim.  In fact, we are tied by the ultimate  document of our Nation, and that is  the United  States  Constitution.  It  makes it very clear in that Constitution, Article  I,  section  2,  that  the  House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second  year  by  the  people  of  the  several  States.  It doesn’t say territories,  it  doesn’t say the Delegates of the territories, it doesn’t say Resident Commissioner.  I might, indeed, support a move for  statehood  for any of those entities.  However, this is an unconscionable action. This is a violation of the public  trust, and it is a clear abuse of power.  Under this strategy, under this Democrat plot, the majority party could  seat anybody, anybody, in the House.  Who is next? Who would you like to  seat next? Howard Dean? He has a significant constituency. Why not have  Howard Dean have a seat in the United  States House of Representatives and a  vote in the Committee of the Whole?  Mr. Speaker, the American people  are disgusted with this level of arrogance and the abuse of power that this  demonstrates. I urge my colleagues to  defeat this rule and to defeat the underlying bill. We will ultimately see  the final defeat of this in the Supreme  Court of the United States.  ",2007
154,6,2007-01-24,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Let me encourage  the gentleman from Georgia to read  the rule. The Republicans were offered  the right for a substitute. They could  have had a substitute that null and  voided this entire resolution, and they  chose not to.  There  is an amendment made  in  order under the rule by the gentleman  from Illinois or his designee, which I  strongly disagree with, that would essentially gut this entire provision. It  would allow no one, with the possible  exception of the gentlewoman who represents the District of Columbia, to be  able to participate. So the opportunity  is there. What the gentleman needs to  do is read the rule.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2minutes to  the  gentlewoman  from Guam  (Ms.  BORDALLO).  (Ms.  BORDALLO  asked  and was  given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2007
155,6,2007-01-24,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in support of the rule under consideration which, if adopted, will allow this  House to openly and fairly debate an  issue  important  to my constituents  and to our fellow Americans who reside  right here in the shadow of the Capitol  dome, the citizens of our Nation’s Capital City, and our  fellow Americans  who reside in the U.S. territories.  I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this rule because it means we can move forward  with this important debate. Our participation  in  the Committee of  the  Whole, a symbolic vote, in the manner  proposed by  the amendment  to  the  rules would be consistent with the very  foundations of our representative democracy.  This issue is about elected public office for which we, as Members and Delegates alike, take a solemn oath. Like  all Members, we, too, solemnly affirm  to support and defend the Constitution  of the United States and to well and  faithfully discharge the duties inherent  with that responsibility.  Mr. Speaker, it is in keeping with  this oath that I come to the floor today  to appeal for support on the rule and  the resolution on principle and on the  merits of this issue.  This  is  about  representation,  the  very core of this institution. This is  about a symbolic but meaningful gesture. It is about inclusion. It is about  the principle that every American deserves to be represented with a vote in  Congress.  This is a step in the right direction.  It is not without precedent, and it has  survived review by the judicial branch.  The history of service by Delegates to  Congress  from  the  territories dates  back almost to the  founding of our  country. The noted and well-respected  historian Robert Remini, in his excellent history of the House published just  last year, notes that one of the most  unique features of the House of Representatives under the Constitution is  the fact that Delegates from the territories can participate, and have participated, in important debates.  I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this rule in the  spirit of this tradition.  ",2007
156,6,2007-01-24,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, at this  time I am very happy to yield 1 minute  to a very hardworking Member from  Pittsburgh (Mr. TIMMURPHY).  ",2007
157,6,2007-01-24,Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania.,"  Mr. Speaker, we certainly appreciate  and admire all of the citizens of the  United States and all those from territories, and they participate in debate  here.  One of the things that helps us understand what takes place here, I would  like to go back to what happens in  Alleghany County where I live in the  city  of  Pittsburgh. We  have  an  Alleghany County Council, and they  meet in the city of Pittsburgh regularly, and some members of that council are citizens of the city of Pittsburgh; but their jurisdiction is not the  city of Pittsburgh. What would happen  if they decided it would be their jurisdiction to vote on issues that affected  that city on matters of taxation and  other issues that take place? I believe  the courts would say that just because  you are citizens of this area does not  mean that your  jurisdiction of your  elected body extends to that city, and  courts would strike it down.  This is not an issue of whether or not  we respect and admire our friends and  fellow citizens from these territories.  It is the matter of the rules of what our  Constitution states and what people  can represent and what should be allowed in this body. It concerns me that  on the tote boards here of the list of  votes, it does not say whether somebody is a full Member or a Delegate.  That, I believe, is something that is  also going to mislead the American  public as to the vote totals here.  But more than anything else, to be  able to vote on issues that affect my  constituents, whether it is taxation or  other  issues of representation,  it  is  simply not in our Constitution to have  that there, and I urge Members to vote  ‘‘no’’ on this.  ",2007
158,6,2007-01-24,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  6 minutes to the gentlewoman from the  District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON), the  District of Columbia, a place where  there is taxation but not full representation.

165,20,2007-01-24,Mr. MCHENRY.,"  league.  Madam Speaker,  today  the House  Democrats  continue  their  abuse  of  power. They are pushing  forward a  measure to allow the territory Delegates, nonvoting Members of Congress  traditionally, actually, not Members of  Congress on a technical basis because  they don’t represent States, their constituents don’t pay Federal  income  taxes, they are going to allow these individuals to cast votes and even preside  when the Chamber meets. So let’s have  a quick Q&A on this; let’s talk questions and answers here.  Why would the Democrats do this?  Because 80 percent of the territory Delegates are, hold for an answer here,  they are Democrats. They want  to  cushion their numbers. Why is this an  abuse of power? Well, there is this little thing we Americans call the Constitution. It says, ‘‘The House shall be  comprised of Members chosen by the  people of the several States,’’ not territories, not mayors of cities allowed to  vote on this House floor, not any individual, but  ‘‘comprised of Members  chosen by the people of the several  States,’’ not non-State territories. But  plainly the Democrats are cushioning  their numbers and abusing their power.  thank my  colI  The Democrats’ power grab is a continuation of the abusive policies and  actions they have taken since day one  in this institution. Since day one they  have shut down all debate. Since day  one they have shut down the committee process. They held open a vote  to change the outcome because they  were  losing on  the vote. They  ran  through the Speaker’s special interest  project  affectionately  known  as  TunaGate, and all without  fulfilling  their pledge of working a 5-day week.  In fact, in 3 weeks we only worked 40  hours  in this House. That  is a new  Democrat majority, that is a continuation of the abuse of power.  What we have to do today is vote  down this legislation that is, first, unconstitutional, and second, an abuse of  power by the Democrat majority.  I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on  this measure.  ",2007
166,20,2007-01-24,Mr. HASTINGS of Florida.," Madam  Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished woman from the Virgin Islands,  my  good  friend,  Dr.  CHRISTENSEN.  ",2007
167,20,2007-01-24,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," Thank you for  yielding, ",2007
168,20,2007-01-24,Mr. HASTINGS.,"  Madam Speaker, I rise as a representative of the people of the U.S. Virgin  Islands, proud Americans who willingly  and gladly serve this country in every  way, including the ultimate sacrifice,  as I have said on two occasions on this  floor this morning, and who only seek  the  fullest  representation  possible  under the Constitution of the United  States, and that is purely and simply  what H.R. 78 does. I thank the Democratic  leadership, Mr. HASTINGS, and  my colleagues for their support.  Just as it did in 1992, the rule granting Delegates the right to vote in the  Committee of the Whole  includes a  mechanism which provided for an automatic revote in the full House of any of  the amendments which passed or failed  by a margin that included the votes of  the Delegates. That rule and procedure  was tested in Federal court and was  upheld as constitutional.  While this is less than perfect, as is  often said, we must not let the perfect  be the enemy of the good, or, I add, the  enemy of what is the right thing to do.  Listening to the strong objections  from the other side on the basis of unconstitutionality, taxation, and others  which are not relevant to the discussion, I have to wonder if these same objections would be raised by my Republican colleagues, an issue that is clearly one of participation and inclusion, if  there were four Republican Delegates  and one Democratic Delegate.  The one Resident Commissioner and  four Delegates in the House of Representatives are the sole congressional  representatives  of  over  4.5 million  Americans. It is apparently lost to my  friends on the other side of the aisle  that these Americans have no representation whatsoever in the U.S. Senate in  addition to their Delegates being unable to vote in the House of Representatives on legislation that has great and  enduring impact on the lives of those  we represent.  During the historic debate in 2002 on  the resolution authorizing the use of  military force against Iraq, for example, although I spoke on the record, I  was not able to vote ‘‘yea’’ or ‘‘nay’’ on  behalf of my constituents, many of  whom  I knew would soon be called  upon to serve and die for their country.  Madam Speaker, my fellow Delegates  and  Resident  Commissioner  have  worked closely with all of you at the  committee  level,  some  of  us  have  chaired subcommittees or will be doing  so in the near future. It is therefore fitting and proper that we be given the  right to vote in the Committee of the  Whole once again. It worked well in the  103rd Congress; it does not violate the  Constitution.  We should be given this greater degree  of  participation  in  the  forumlation of the laws that affect the  lives of the people who send us here to  represent them. And then once we have  passed this, we must go on from here to  give the residents of the District of Columbia full voting rights in this body  as they deserve.  I ask my colleagues to respect your  fellow Americans in the District and  the territories. Do justice to your colleagues; let’s get a unanimous vote for  democracy. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on H. Res. 78.  ",2007
169,20,2007-01-24,Mr.  HASTINGS  of  Washington.,"  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield  21⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. GARRETT).  Mr.  GARRETT  of  New  Jersey.  Madam Speaker, I rise, too, in strong  opposition to this resolution which violates the Constitution and the fundamental intent of the Framers of the  Constitution as well, and it does so in  four ways.  First,  it would allow Delegates to  vote, even though our Founding Fathers  intended  that  this  legislative  body  represent  the  people  of  the  States. The Constitution, Article  I,  section 2, clause 1, states, ‘‘The House  of Representatives shall be composed  of Members chosen by the people of the  several States.’’ By definition, Delegates do not represent States.  Secondly, this resolution violates the  principle of one person, one vote.  The average  congressional district  represents approximately 650,000 people, but three of these areas have populations of less than 160,000 people, and  American Samoa has residents of less  than 57,000 people.  The Supreme Court has already spoken on this. In 1964, the decision of  Wesberry  v. Sanders,  the Supreme  Court said,  ‘‘To say a vote is worth  more in one district than in another  would run not only counter to our fundamental ideas of a democrat government, but it would also cast aside the  principles of the House of Representatives elected by the people. That was a  principle tenaciously fought for and established at the Constitutional Convention.’’  Thirdly, the qualifications for these  Delegates are not the same as all the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:43 Apr 19, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD07\H24JA7.REC H24JA7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007
170,27,2007-01-24,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding. I certainly reassure you  we are moving in that direction, and I  would hope that would be the case. I  hope the gentleman will take this as a  very friendly observation that in this  case, the gentleman wouldn’t take apparently yes for an answer. We were  going to give him an amendment.  As you know, the day before we had  been bitterly criticized for not giving  amendments. I was not there and I did  not participate in this decision, but the  committee was confronted with wanting to be  in a position to give an  amendment. Then when they were told  the gentleman didn’t want the amendment, they in effect took yes for an answer. The gentleman did not.  I understand that. We want to accommodate that. You are absolutely  right.  If a Member doesn’t want to  offer the amendment, he didn’t have to  offer the amendment, he did not offer  the  amendment. Nobody  has  been  forced to offer an amendment. He was  given the opportunity to do so.  But we do understand that Members  make decisions that maybe that is not  what I want to do, and I would like to  withdraw it. Certainly I hope we will  accommodate Members in the future.  ",2007
171,27,2007-01-24,Mr. BLUNT.," I thank you for that response. I would hope that would be the  case. It has happened frequently. The  gentleman has made no  suggestion  that this is unique or no one has ever  thought about this before. It has happened  frequently. When  it has happened in the past, generally submitted  by Members on your side to a Rules  Committee at that time controlled by  our side, when the Member said, wait a  minute, I’ve changed my mind, that  was always honored, with no sense of  no, wait a minute; you put the piece of  paper down, you now have to stick with  it, even though we haven’t acted yet.  ",2007
172,27,2007-01-24,Mr. HOYER.," I want to say, Mr. Leader, we also wanted to give you a substitute, but you didn’t want that either, and we didn’t give you that substitute, then, I guess.  In any event, your point  is well  taken, and I don’t want to be jocular  about the fact. We really do want to  make sure that you can come to this  floor and think you are being treated  fairly and openly and have an opportunity to make your legislative case.  That is the way this body ought to  work.  I know the first 21⁄2weeks now we  have been moving on an agenda, rules  changes and others, that we wanted to  get done. As you know, some of these  have  involved rules changes, as this  particular bill did.  As you know, although Mr. DREIER  talked about having hearings on this,  rarely does either side have hearings  on  the  rules  it presents. The  rules  package is put together by the majority party and there aren’t hearings on  it. It is offered on the floor and it is  voted up or down. In this case we offered your rules, as you know, as they  were in being in the 109th Congress.  There were some additions we wanted  to make.  But your point is well taken. I share  your view that we want to make sure,  whether we disagree, that you feel you  got the opportunity on your side of the  aisle to make your case.  ",2007
173,27,2007-01-24,Mr. BLUNT.," Well, I appreciate my  friend’s comments. We look forward to  that happening. I think we all will benefit from more debate, more discussion.  That has always been the desire here,  and often the minority doesn’t feel like  they get quite their opportunity to do  that, but we hope that we have an opportunity to do that and look forward  to moving to a process to where all the  Members are involved, the new Members.  Some of these issues, I will admit,  that we have dealt with in the last 2  weeks, in fact in the last Congress, the  Congress  I was  in  the majority  in,  passed bills highly similar. But the 60  new Members didn’t get to participate  in committee.  But that is behind us. I am prepared  to look forward. I hope that we have  those opportunities. We will look carefully at the character of the CR and  hope  that  it  is as minimal  in  its  changes as possible and that all the  members of the Appropriations Committee are part of that discussion.  f  DISPENSING  WITH  CALENDAR  WEDNESDAY  BUSINESS  ON  WEDNESDAY NEXT  ",2007

In honor of that  ride in 1907, the Curtiss Museum and  the City of Ormond Beach, Florida,  which  is  the  ‘‘birthplace of  speed,’’  hosted a Curtiss motorcycle run on the  beach today, January 24, 2007.  In addition  to his  recordbreaking  speed, which was 137 miles an hour, Mr.  Curtiss was the founder of the Curtiss  Aeroplane and Motor Company, now  part of the Curtiss-Wright Corporation.  Glenn Curtiss also developed the first  successful sea plane and manufactured  the famous World War I Jenny training  plane.  Again, Madam Speaker,  it  is with  great pride that I rise today to honor  the memory of Mr. Glenn Curtiss, and  I encourage all Members to join me in  honoring the legacy of Mr. Curtiss and  cosponsoring House Resolution 84.

182,34,2007-01-24,Mr. HODES.," Mr. Speaker. Last night  I watched the State of the Union Address in this hall for the first time as a  Member of Congress. While I found the  pageantry inspiring, I wish I could say  the same about the speech itself.  We heard another attempt to allay  with hollow rhetoric the concerns of an  alarmed Nation about the war in Iraq.  And rather than seizing an opportunity  to level with the American people and  set the new course they rightly demand, the administration, once again,  chose to cling to its delusions and insist that its failing policies be enacted.  In 2003, the administration requested  and received from Congress authority  to invade Iraq on the basis of the claim  that Iraq possessed weapons of mass  destruction and presented an imminent  threat to our national security. Senior  administration officials claimed that  the Iraqi Government was connected  with the al Qaeda terrorists who perpetrated the attacks of September 11,  2001. And we now know that neither the  premise  for the  invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq nor the claim  of a connection to 9/11 was true.  After the fall of Baghdad, the administration sent in officials with little or  no knowledge and understanding of  Iraq, its people, its culture or its politics. Costly mistakes,  including  the  dismantling of the army and the failure to secure weapons stockpiles, paved  the way for the current situation in  Iraq: More than $450 billion spent with  billions unaccounted for; an undependable Iraqi Government, unwilling or incapable of controlling warring sects in  their militias; more than 3,000 American deaths, and more than 25,000 soldiers maimed or grievously wounded;  hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians  killed, wounded or driven from their  homes by sectarian violence; and a profound loss of respect for our country in  the region and around the world.  All in all, it constitutes an unparalleled  foreign policy disaster  for the  United States.  The administration still has no plans  for a responsible exit strategy to protect our security. And unbelievably,  the administration wants to send an  additional 21,000 troops to Iraq.  The proposal is a cavalier rejection  of the sound views of the American  people, the consensus of the bipartisan  Iraq Study Group, and the counsel of  wise military commanders.  In a city of some 7 million people,  and without a unified government or  the infrastructure to provide jobs to an  ever more agitated population, an injection of 20,000 troops will not succeed. It can only stoke the flames of  chaos and bloodshed in Iraq.  Our national strategic interests, Mr.  Speaker, require a change of course,  not an escalation. The imperative to  support our troops requires a change of  course, not an escalation.  Last year the Republican-controlled  House declared in the defense authorization bill that 2006 would be a year of  transition to Iraqi control of Iraq, and  that redeployment would begin at that  point. Yet here we are in 2007 with the  administration  calling  for  an  escalation supported by many in this body.  In my judgment, Mr. Speaker, the  time has come and gone for this Congress to say ‘‘enough is enough.’’ The  time has come and gone for statements  of concern. The time has come and  gone for ‘‘trust but verify.’’ The situation in Iraq is dire.  It is now time for this Congress to do  what  the American  people  said  so  clearly in November that they wanted  us to do: Change the course in Iraq. We  have a saying in my home State in New  Hampshire,  ‘‘When you’re  in a hole,  stop digging.’’  Mr. Speaker, I support our valiant  troops, and I oppose the administration’s proposed escalation. I resolve to  work with my colleagues over the coming weeks for a concrete new direction  in Iraq. In the absence of an acceptable  plan from the President, the American  people are calling upon Congress to  lead the way. Popular demand for new  direction in Iraq is, in large part, the  reason I am here in Washington and  the reason Democrats now hold the  majority.  b1545  We can no longer accept empty promises from the administration or hope  the administration will honestly confront the realty of  its  failures. The  American people are looking to this  Congress for leadership. They are impatient. And we must and we will respond.  f  OFF  30  DUST  FROM  CONGRESS  SHOULD  OVERSIGHT  PLAN  YEARS AGO  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  JOHNSONof Georgia). Under a previous  order of the House, the gentleman from  California  (Mr. SCHIFF)  is recognized  for 5 minutes.  ",2007
183,34,2007-01-24,Mr. SCHIFF.," Mr. Speaker, in December 2005, we learned that the Bush administration was using the National  Security Agency, the NSA, to eavesdrop on Americans on U.S. soil without  a warrant or judicial oversight, in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  Over a year later, Congress has yet to  address this issue, and the NSA’s secret  surveillance  program  has  continued  unabated. Just last week the administration  continued  its unilateral approach,  announcing  that  notwithstanding  its protestations  last year,  that it could not possibly allow the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court to oversee the NSA program; it  would now submit to the court’s jurisdiction, but not tell the Congress how  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Court would oversee the program or  why its policies have changed.  When Members  of Congress  questioned the Attorney General and the  National Intelligence Director regarding this shift in policy, both officials  refused to provide information regarding the nature of the administration’s  new policy in this area.  Indeed, we have no idea whether the  administration  is now  seeking warrants on an  individualized basis or  broad programmatic approval from the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court.  Congressional silence in this area and  others has had other  repercussions.  Earlier this month Congress was again  caught by surprise when we  learned  that the President has claimed potentially sweeping new powers to open  Americans’ mail without a court warrant.  Again, the administration could obtain a warrant, and quickly, from a  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Court judge, but has chosen not to submit this effort to court supervision. Interestingly, the developments over the  last year bear a striking resemblance  to events that occurred some 30 years  ago, when a series of troubling reports  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:43 Apr 19, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD07\H24JA7.REC H24JA7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007
184,41,2007-01-24,Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut.," Ms.  WASSERMANSCHULTZ, you are exactly  right. I remember standing at a supermarket in my district during the campaign or maybe a few years before, and  a woman who was, I think, 59, 58 years  old, who had been laid off, and who understandably was having trouble finding new employment. It is difficult for  older Americans to find a new job, especially one that has a comprehensive  package of benefits. And she looked at  me with this blank face and said, ‘‘Why  am I in this position? Why can I not  get health care when I know the Medicare program is right there? I am willing to pay for it. I am willing to contribute to it. And yet I can’t get access  to this program simply because I have  been put into a situation where I can’t  find a job or I can’t find a job with benefits, and I don’t qualify for the program.’’  So there are ways that we can help,  as you said, those older Americans who  are on the cusp of being able to qualify  for Medicare, and certainly the millions of children around this country  who have no health care insurance and  end up getting sick. I mean, they get  sick, and they come  into our emergency rooms to get the care they need.  Mr. RYANsaid here the other night, we  do have a system of universal coverage  in this country; unfortunately, it is in  our emergency rooms rather than in  our doctors’ offices and our primary  care doctors’ offices.  And maybe just to tie this back to  what we were  talking about before  when it comes to the war in Iraq. You  know, we have an obligation to our  veterans when they come back, and  what we have done here over the past  10 years to the health care system for  veterans is a travesty of justice to the  brave men and women who have fought  for this country.  I absolutely support moving towards  universal coverage.  I think you are  right, it doesn’t have to be done all at  SCHULTZ Ms. WASSERMAN once. In fact, I think the best proposals  before this body are to really take  some commonsense approaches to it.  But maybe the first thing we should do  is start to repair some of the damage  that we did to the veterans health care  system to make sure that when you  volunteer to serve this country abroad,  that when you come back, you are  going to get the mental health care  that you need, that you are going to  not have to wait in line for a surgery  that you badly need. Maybe that is our  first obligation is to take care of those  folks, because in the end we are here to  serve everyone, but we are certainly  here to make sure that those people  that fight for us, Mr. MEEK, are taken  care of. And I would yield to you.  b1645  ",2007
185,41,2007-01-24,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," All I am going  to do is do a close. I know we have the  Web site and all, but I want to yield to  because  I  want to tell you, I am not from Connecticut, but if I was one of your constituents, I would vote for you. You are  good.

188,41,2007-01-24,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Thank  you so much. One of the things that I  think  is  important  for the Members  and other folks to know is we did this  30-something hour night after night in  the minority for the last several years,  and we want folks to know that we are  not just shutting down and becoming  complacent and resting on our laurels  now that we are in the majority because there continues to be a need for  accountability, as  the State of  the  Union address demonstrated last night.  We are going to assert Congress’s  oversight role, reestablish the system  of checks and balances that was totally  absent the last number of years. We are  going to use the 30-something Working  Group forum to be able to do that and  also talk about what Democrats are  going to do,  implement our agenda,  talk about the priorities of the American people.  I am so thrilled that we have expanded our ranks and that we have an  opportunity to interact and dialogue  with you. I can tell you that on election night on November 7, I was cheering very loud that you were coming to  join us in the 110th.  Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield to  Mr. MURPHYand he is going to give the  Web site out and we will be ready to  shut down.  ",2007

So I am glad to maybe provide a  little bit of material for the next crop  of 30-somethings.  May I do Mr. RYAN’s job today?  ",2007

199,62,2007-01-24,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, I rise to  thank the Senator from Tennessee for  his  support at  this  second  look at  waste amendment which I have offered.  The Senator’s arguments, as always,  are extraordinarily cogent and logical.  He makes the point—which I think is  very valid, as a former Governor who  had the line-item veto, which is a much  stronger authority than what we have  in this amendment—that this is important, managing the  fiscal house, to  making sure that items which get into  legislation as a result of being put in  arbitrarily by some individual Member  of Congress but which are not subject  to the light of day in the traditional  way—by being brought across the floor  as individual items but, rather, are put  into major pieces of legislation, sometimes representing hundreds of billions  of  dollars  in  spending—that  those  items can be reviewed again and get a  vote as to their credibility and as to  their appropriateness and whether they  represent something on which American tax dollars should be spent.  This proposal, this fast-track rescission, which is what it really is, is not  a partisan proposal. In  fact, as proposed in my amendment, second look  at waste,  it would actually be primarily under the control of the next  President. It has a 4-year window of activity and then it is sunsetted. By the  time it would get into law, should it  pass  the Senate and  then pass  the  House, it is likely that this President  will only have, probably, a year and a  half to use this authority, and then the  next President, whoever that President  may be—maybe a Republican, maybe a  Democrat—will have the authority to  use this rescission ability for 21⁄2years.  So it is not partisan.  Second, it was drafted, as the Senator from Tennessee noted, basically to  mirror a proposal that was put forward  by Senator Daschle. In  fact, I have  called  this  amendment  daughter  of  Daschle. It is essentially the Daschle  amendment as offered back  in 1995,  which was  cosponsored  by Senator  BYRD.  There  are  only  two major  changes—well,  three major  changes,  and I have already said to those who  have asked me that I am willing to adjust those changes to bring  it even  more in line with Daschle.  One of the changes in this bill from  the Daschle bill was that the President  would have 300 days to send up his rescission notice. Some people have expressed concern that that gives the  President the ability to use that rescission notice as a club over people’s  heads. The reason we gave the President 300 days in this amendment was  we had reduced the number of rescission notices  in  the Daschle amendment. There were potentially 13 rescission actions available to the President,  and in this amendment, there are only  4 available to the President. Therefore,  in the Daschle amendment, it was required that the rescission notice be  sent up soon after the bill was signed.  But, of course, with 13 different opportunities, it could go on all year long.  We felt that since we were reducing it  to four, we should give the President  more leeway as to when he sent up  those rescission notices.  But I can understand the argument.  In  fact, I accept the argument that  maybe that is too much authority in  the sense it gives the President too  much leverage over the Congress. So  when,  I hope—I am using the term  ‘‘when’’—when this amendment comes  forward in an amendable form, I will  offer an amendment to reduce the 300  days back to 30 days. So the President  would have to send up his rescission  notices within  30 days of  it being  signed, or at least asking us to take a  second look at it, and that should adjust that problem and bring it directly  in line, pretty much in line with what  the Daschle amendment was originally.  The other area which was different  from the Daschle amendment  is the  issue that deals with mandatory spending. Some people have said new mandatory spending—not existing programs,  not existing veterans programs or farm  programs or Medicare or Medicaid, but  if there is a new mandatory program,  that can also be subjected to the President asking for a second look at it. It  has been argued by some on the other  side that this would undermine the  ability to reach a comprehensive settlement on entitlement reform. That is  really a straw argument. That argument has no legs.  The practical matter is, if a President reaches an agreement with the  Congress  on  something  as  extraordinarily  important as major entitlement reform, part of that agreement is  going to be that the President signed  off on it. So this argument of, well, but  the President might come back and  change it later on with a rescission notice really has no legs. It is just being  made for the purpose of giving comfort  to folks who believe they want to vote  against this amendment. If people want  to vote against it, that is their right.  But don’t use that as an excuse.  What  this  amendment  essentially  does is it allows the Congress to fulfill  its obligation to make sure that money  which is sent by our taxpayers is spent  effectively,  honestly,  appropriately,  and without waste. And, it gives the  executive branch a role in asking the  question of Congress: Did you really  mean to spend this money?  I have to say, I have been here for a  while—14 years in the Senate—and I  have seen a lot of bills come across this  floor which were fairly large, and when  I took a look at them after I maybe  had voted for it, I realized there were  some things  in them that  I wished  weren’t  in them. I didn’t happen to  vote for the highway bill which had the  bridge to nowhere—the famous highway bill. But had I voted for it, I think  I would have wanted to take a second  look at some of the projects in that  bill.  The same is true of a lot of our appropriations bills when we get to the  end of the year and we haven’t gotten  our appropriations process completed  effectively, so we lump 3 or 4 different  appropriations bills, sometimes 5 or 6,  occasionally  10,  appropriations  bills  into 1 and we call it an Omnibus appropriations bill. Those bills tend to get  items in them which have received no  scrutiny, which are simply the result  of an earmark for the purpose of accomplishing  something which  some  Member of the Senate or the House  feels is appropriate but which one suspects, if the entire House or the Senate  were to take a look at, we would say:  Well, better to put that money toward  reducing the deficit than toward spending the money in this specific area.  So this bill is, as I have said and as  the Senator  from Tennessee so eloquently said, a second look at waste.  The purpose is to give us, the Congress,  another tool to manage waste.  Now, I wish it had come up last week  because, quite honestly, I thought it  was much more appropriate  to  last  week’s debate when we were debating  earmarks and when about 50 percent of  the debate time was spent on earmarks  VerDate Aug 31 2005  23:55 Jan 24, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G24JA6.006 S24JAPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

201,69,2007-01-24,Mr. DEMINT.," Mr. President, I, too,  would like to speak on the line-item  veto amendment. This body has made a  lot of progress  in being much more  transparent in how we spend America’s  money. We can see, if we look back  over the  last couple of weeks, that  America  appreciates what we  have  tried to do to take these earmarks or  these pet projects or designated spending, whatever we call it, and make it  available for every American to see.  We could tell from our e-mails and letters and the reports in the media that  this was something which made Congress look as if we were genuinely trying to be much more open and honest  about how we spend America’s money.  The amendment before us now, what  we refer to as the line-item veto or  line-item  rescission, would  actually  make this whole process much more  accountable.  I was interested in hearing my colleague make his point that the President could take one good item and put  it with a really bad item and send it  over to us and force us to make a decision. But let’s think about what the  President’s options are now. We can  send thousands of earmarks over in a  bill to the President, and he only has  two choices—to take it or leave it, to  take the whole thing or veto the whole  thing—and work that has been done  here and in the House for months either has to be accepted  in total or  thrown out in total. That doesn’t make  any sense.  I will use the exact argument my colleague did. We should not be able to  package all this good with all this bad  and try to force it down the President’s  throat without the ability to have the  checks and balances, the discussions  that are needed so the American people  can  see we have  thoroughly vetted  these ideas and we are spending their  money wisely.  This line-item rescission package I  support because this Congress needs  the interaction with the President and  the working relationship that would be  caused by this particular bill. It allows  the President, no more than four times  a year, to go through our spending bills  and to send those things back which he  thinks are not national priorities. This  is not real complicated. He does not  veto what we send him; he just gets a  recommendation  in the process. And  since his agencies  in  the executive  branch are charged with carrying this  out  and  spending  this money,  the  President needs to be engaged in the  process  in more  than a  take-it-or-  leave-it  type of  relationship. So no  more than four times a year, the President can put  together  those  things  which he thinks are not national priorities and send them to the Congress.  And all this bill does is guarantee that  they get a vote.  If the President tries to use this  against  individual Members,  I know  this body well enough to know that we  are not going to pass his request.  Any President that tries to do that  for political purposes will find his rescission  package,  or  that  his  recommendations to Congress will be dispensed with very quickly.  This is important not only for this  President but for many Presidents in  the future. We know as Senators and  Congressmen that over the next several  decades this country  is going to be  faced with incredible fiscal crises. We  have no idea how we are going to pay  for Medicare and Medicaid in the future or Social Security. It is going to  become more  important  every year  that we cut wasteful spending and that  we work with the President and with  the House to do everything we can to  cut  those  things  that are not necessary.  In many bills—and we know it happens—many items, earmarks, are voted  on for political reasons, and it is a good  idea to allow the President to package  those things and send them back to us  so that we can vote on them and move  them out if they are not national priorities.  This is not dissimilar at all to the  BRAC process we created to eliminate  unnecessary military bases. We found  that Congressmen and Senators were  not going to vote on an individual basis  to eliminate a base in one State because we knew that then the Congressmen or Senators could vote to eliminate one in our State. It was a political  dilemma that caused us for years to  leave bases open that should have been  closed.  It is the same with Federal programs  and  spending year  after year. One  project might be in my State and one  in another Senator’s State. None of us  are willing to step up and eliminate  projects one at a time. We cannot vote  on them that way. This line-item rescission opportunity is for the President to take those things that we know  are not national priorities, put them in  a package, and send them back over for  us to vote on. We should not lose this  opportunity.  We need the President working with  the Congress  to  eliminate wasteful  spending—not this year or next year  but for decades to come. This may be  our only opportunity in a long time to  make it happen. We have made tremendous progress on identifying the problems with corruption, wasteful spending, identifying earmarks, and all this  VerDate Aug 31 2005  23:55 Jan 24, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G24JA6.019 S24JAPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

",2007
209,76,2007-01-24,Mr. SMITH.," Madam President, I rise  today to offer an amendment to H.R. 2,  the Fair Minimum Wage Act. My  amendment would make permanent existing education tax benefits that are  set to expire in the near future.  I am a big supporter of the Republican progrowth tax policies that have  been  implemented over the past  few  years. These policies have had a tremendous impact on our economy. Since  August 2003, more than 7.2 million jobs  have been created.  Our unemployment rate remains low  at 4.5 percent, which is well below the  5.1 percent average rate for 2005, and  below the average of each of the past  four decades.  And thanks to our strong economic  growth, tax revenues continue to pour  in. Tax receipts in December were $18  billion higher than a year earlier.  My amendment focuses on an important component of the Bush tax cuts—  education  tax benefits. This amendment would make permanent a number  of important tax provisions that make  it easier for Americans to save for college and pay for their children’s education expenses.  Educating our citizens is critical if  we want to remain competitive in the  global economy. But as tuition costs  continue to escalate,  it has become  more and more difficult for American  families to cover these expenses on  their own.  The education tax benefits that have  been enacted over the past few years  will help American families meet these  obligations. Therefore, it is important  that we don’t let these tax benefits expire.  My amendment would make permanent the deduction for qualified tuition  and related expenses which is set to expire at the end of 2007. The 2001 tax act  created this new deduction which allows middle-income Americans to take  a deduction for higher education expenses of up to $4,000.  In 2004, over 4.5 million American  families took advantage of this deduction. And in my home state of Oregon,  almost 65,000 families used the deduction.  In addition, if certain requirements  are satisfied, an employee can exclude  from gross income up to $5,250 annually  of educational assistance provided by  an employer. This exclusion applies to  both  graduate  and  undergraduate  courses.  Because of this favorable tax treatment, many employers provide their  employees with educational assistance.  However,  the exclusion will not be  available after December 31, 2010. My  amendment would make this provision  permanent.  Coverdell education savings accounts  are an important tool for Americans to  save for future education expenses. The  2001 tax act made a number of reforms  to enhance these accounts. For example, it increased the annual contribution limit to $2,000 from $500 and expanded the definition of qualified expenses to include elementary and secondary school expenses.  However, like the exclusion for employer provided educational assistance,  these enhancements expire after 2010.  My amendment would make these enhancements permanent.  Finally, the recently enacted tax extenders package extended the deduction  for  educator  expenses  through  2007. This provision provides a $250 per  year  above-the-line  deduction  for  teachers for expenses paid for supplies,  such as books and computer equipment.  Teaching is one of the most important professions  in our society. And  this provision provides teachers with a  little help in purchasing the supplies  they need to be good teachers.  In Oregon, over 33,000 teachers benefited from this deduction in 2003. And  my amendment would make this provision permanent.  I yield the floor.  ",2007

",2007
215,76,2007-01-24,Mr. ALLARD.," Madam President,  I  rise today to ask my colleagues to support amendment No. 116, which I will  discuss.  This amendment allows States the  rights and flexibility to determine a  minimum wage that works for them.  Every  State  has  its  own microeconomy, and the voters and legislatures in those areas have decided what  works best.  This is reflected in a map I have for  demonstration purposes, reflecting the  number of States in green that have  higher wage rates than the minimum  Federal rate. It reflects  in blue the  States with wage rates the same as the  Federal  rate. We  have  American  Samoa, which has a special minimum  wage rate, and States with no minimum wage rate, which are very few,  by the way. They rely on the Federal,  in that case, where they do not have  one. And States with a minimum wage  rate lower than the Federal, again, the  State is preempted.  I rise to point out that the merits of  increasing the Federal minimum wage,  for better or for worse, for days on  end—there is no debate on the cost of  living, and wages greatly differ from  State to state.

216,83,2007-01-24,Mr. VITTER.," Mr. President, I rise in  support of this amendment No. 110. It  is very simple, very straightforward,  very basic, but also very important. It  is to reduce, in a meaningful way, the  excessive  paperwork  burden  facing  small businesses.  As I begin, I also want to thank Senfor cosponsoring this  amendment. As have I, he has  long  been at work on this issue and has offered great leadership. I thank him for  joining with me in this effort.  Businesses  face  enormous  hurdles  and obstacles and challenges, particularly  small  business. Unfortunately,  one of them has become the enormous  paperwork burden created by all levels  of government. A small business  in  Louisiana, depending on the nature and  location of the business, has to deal  with myriad Federal agencies. Just off  the top of my head, these include the  EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  Coast Guard, SBA, Labor, Commerce,  IRS, and Customs, to name a few. That  doesn’t  include—and my amendment  doesn’t pertain  to—all of  the State  agencies with which  they  similarly  have to deal and  file paperwork because of regulations from local entities  at the governmental level.  The  compounded  effect of  this  is  enormous. All of those requirements,  paperwork and others, can be absolutely  suffocating. There  has  been  some quantification of this enormous  compliance cost. In September 2005, the  SBA Office of Advocacy  released a  study that gave us a glimpse into this.  It said businesses with fewer than 20  employees spend more than $7,600 per  employee just to comply with Federal  regulations. That is a staggering cost.  To a truly small business that doesn’t  have a vice president in charge of compliance, doesn’t have a team of lawyers  or a team of paper filers in the back office to take care of it, that is a real  burden. It distracts the principals of  the business from doing what they set  out to do, the main focus and mission  of the business.  All too often, the way those regulations and requirements are administered  is  in the tone of a  ‘‘gotcha’’  game, fining small businesses for paperwork  violations  just  to  say  ‘‘gotcha,’’ just for the sake of doing it,  of issuing those violations and in some  cases of gaining revenue for the department of government. All of that  is  wrong, and we need to change it.  Nobody here—myself included—is arguing that we don’t need a legitimate  layer of regulation to protect and promote health and safety, the environment, worker safety, et cetera. Nobody  is arguing against that. That is not  what we are talking about. What we  are talking about today is an amendment I offer on the minimum wage bill  which includes provisions I introduced  separately as the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2007. I thank Mr.  NEUGEBAUERof Texas in the House for  introducing identical companion legislation, as we both did in the last Congress. Again, this  is basic, straightforward, simple, but very important to  small business.  This is exactly how it would work. It  would direct Federal agencies not to  impose civil fines for a first-time violation of their agency’s paperwork requirements by a small business unless  the head of the agency determines the  following: the violation has the potential to cause serious harm to the public  interest; not issuing a fine may impair  criminal investigations; the violation  is a violation of Internal Revenue law;  the violation is not corrected within 6  months; or the violation presents a  danger to public health or safety. In  addition,  the amendment  says  that  fines can be waived in the case of a violation that could potentially present a  danger,  if the violation  is corrected  within 24 hours of the small business  receiving notification of the violation.  It is important that the first list of  those possibilities are mandatory. An  agency can’t issue civil fines for a first-  time violation unless one of  those  things happens. But the second part of  it—fines can be waived unless corrected  within  24 hours—is discretionary. A  fine doesn’t have to be waived in that  instance by  the appropriate Federal  regulatory agency.  This is very constrained, very limited, very common sense. Again, the  most important part of the provision  is, it is first-time violations. It is a  small business.  It  is civil penalties  only. We are not talking criminal. We  are not talking a big business with a  big compliance  section. We are not  talking a mandatory waiving of fines  for health and safety violations where  it goes to public health.  This is not only a reasonable thing to  do, it is long overdue considering the  enormous compliance costs I alluded to  before—$7,600 per worker for a small  business of 20 employees or less—just  to take care of Federal requirements.  That doesn’t count State or local. We  are only dealing with Federal because  we are the Federal legislature.  This bill is particularly relevant to  my home following the devastation of  Hurricanes Rita  and Katrina.  The  small business base in Louisiana was  devastated by those horrific events. In  many areas, small businesses are starting from scratch, and the whole community of small businesses is starting  from scratch as it begins to recover  from that destruction. Particularly in  that context, they need this sort of  reasonable relief—limited, focused civil  fines only, first-time violations only,  small business only, only mandatory  waiver when it doesn’t involve a threat  to public health and safety, all of the  very strenuous and carefully outlined  requirements I set out.  I hope everybody in this Chamber can  come together to support this commonsense proposal. In a broader vein, I  hope this is a part—not the only element but a part—of our coming together to pass a minimum wage  increase with small business regulatory  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:57 Jan 25, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A24JA6.014 S24JAPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P 1 D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

237,97,2007-01-24,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, just  for the information of our colleagues,  the Feingold amendment is an amendment that has been accepted by the  Senate on a number of different occasions. It provides information-reporting on the buying of American goods.  This is an effort to increase and support American workers. It has been accepted. We welcome that amendment.  The  other  amendment which my  friend and colleague will speak to, Senators KERRY, SNOWE, and SUNUNU,  I  strongly support. This deals with the  women’s business center amendment.  Our  friends on  the Small Business  Committee have worked long and hard  on this. It is a very interesting, innovative, and creative program that has  created thousands of jobs and millions  of dollars in wages, and it deserves favorable  consideration. My  colleague  will speak to that in just a few moments.  On the Allard amendment, Members  should understand what the effect of  the Allard amendment is, and that is  effectively  to  repeal  the minimum  wage  for any States among  the  50  States. That effectively is what the Allard amendment does. It says:  Notwithstanding, any employer should not  be required to pay an employee the wage  that is greater than the minimum wage provided by law of the State in which the employee is employed, and not less than the  minimum wage in effect in that State.  So effectively it eliminates the minimum wage.  It is true we have had the minimum  wage at $5.15 an hour. The underlying  bill raises it to $7.25, with a very modest tax offset. Hopefully we will have  an opportunity to vote on that.  It is true that the existing minimum  wage is $5.15 an hour and a number of  States have gone above this, but the  concept of the minimum wage was that  it was going to be a minimum payment, a minimum standard. What was  accepted at the time of the minimum  wage is that in this country, we didn’t  want to accelerate a rush to the bottom so that we would have competition  in the various States to pay the lowest  possible wages—sweat labor—in order  to try to attract industries into those  particular States, but to provide a minimum standard. Hopefully it was going  to be a living standard for workers who  worked 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of  the year.  I respect the Senator from Colorado,  his view on this issue, but if we accepted the amendment of the Senator, it  would effectively eliminate the minimum wage as we know it.  I think the reason for the minimum  wage, as we have tried to point out  during the course of this debate in discussion, was to establish a basic floor  as a standard for payment for individuals who worked long and hard in some  of the most difficult jobs in this country. We have eliminated child labor.  We have established laws with regard  to overtime. We have tried to be not  only  the  strongest economy  in  the  world but one that is going to respect  workers and workers’ rights and workers’  interests and workers’  families.  The minimum wage does not do so at  the present time, but many of us will  continue to battle to try to make sure  it does. The Allard amendment brings  us all in the opposite direction.  If I have any time left, I will reserve  it. I know the Senator from Colorado  will use his time.  ",2007
238,97,2007-01-24,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr. President, I reiterate, my amendment gives flexibility  to States to set their own minimum  wage. What is an appropriate minimum  wage level for one State does not apply  for another, and has different potential  effects on  the ability  for economic  growth in that State. When you vote  for my amendment, you are voting for  State  flexibility. The States are already fulfilling their responsibilities of  regulating wages. My amendment does  not allow the States to set a minimum  wage  lower than their current operating minimum wage as of January 1,  2007.  I ask my colleagues to join me in  voting for the Allard amendment.  I ask for the yeas and nays.  ",2007

245,97,2007-01-24,Mr. KENNEDY.," If the Senator will  yield, I find that there is strong support. We are just having difficulty getting a final time to be able to slot it in  at this particular time. I am very hopeful we will be able to have that sometime in the very near future, and I will  keep in close touch with the Senator. I  thank him for his cooperation. I hope  we will be able to.  if  AMENDMENTNO. 158  ",2007

247,104,2007-01-24,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Mr. President, I  regret that I was unable to vote the  evening of January 18 on a very significant amendment offered by my colleague  from Utah. During  consideration of S. 1 last week, I was concerned  with  section  220 of  the bill, which  would have severely undermined the  ability of Americans to be  informed  about what is happening here in the  Capitol and, thereby, to petition the  Congress with their thoughts.  I applaud Senator BENNETT for offering his  amendment to strike these so-called  grassroots  lobbying  provisions  from  the ethics reform bill, and I thank Senate Republican Leader MCCONNELLand  Senator BENNETT for their leadership  in ensuring this amendment’s success.  I ask that the RECORDreflect that, had  I been here, I would have voted in favor  of Senator BENNETT’s amendment No.  20 last Thursday night.  Additionally, I applaud the Senate’s  careful consideration and passage of S.  1,  the Legislative Transparency and  Accountability Act. Although I was unable to attend the vote on final passage  of S. 1, I support the bill and hope that  a conference to resolve differences between the House and Senate passed  bills is convened soon. Scandals involving lobbyists and members of Congress  from both sides of the aisle have shaken the American public’s confidence in  Congress’s ability to do business objectively and judiciously. Although S. 1  fails to address transparency  for so-  called 527 organizations and  fails to  provide the President the authority to  veto wasteful pork projects, passage of  this bill is an important step toward  broadening transparency in the legislative process, and  I  look  forward to  sending a balanced bill to the President’s desk. I ask that the RECORDreflect that, had I been here, I would  have voted for the bill, just as I voted  for a  similar ethics  reform bill on  March 29, 2006.  f  HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES  CAPTAINBRIANFREEMAN  ",2007
248,104,2007-01-24,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, a month  ago, I traveled to Iraq to meet there  with our men and women in uniform.  One soldier in particular stood out to  me, a bright young West Point graduate, CPT Brian Freeman. Our conversation  lasted  for no more than 5  minutes, and yet I was immediately  struck by his outspoken intelligence.  ‘‘Senator, it is nuts over here. Soldiers  are being asked to do work we’re not  trained to do,’’ he told me. ‘‘I’m doing  work that State Department people are  far more prepared to do in fostering democracy, but they’re not allowed to  come off the bases because it’s too dangerous  here.  It  doesn’t make  any  sense.’’  Now those words have taken on a  tragic resonance. Four days ago, according to media accounts, 30 gunmen  disguised as U.S. officials penetrated  an Iraqi checkpoint in Karbala. Once  inside the Army compound, the reports  say,  they opened  fire and mortally  wounded five American soldiers.  On Sunday, Charlotte Freeman was  visiting her family in Utah when she  found a message on her cell phone.  Army chaplains had been to her house  in California. The daily e-mails from  her husband Brian had stopped. I imagine that few things have more anguish  in them than waiting,  in suspended  fear,  for the news of a  loved one’s  death. Late that afternoon, the news  came.  So I rise to honor Captain Freeman  and to add my voice to his family’s  prayers. His giving spirit and his self-  sacrifice embodied all the best of our  Armed Forces, whether he was working  to take the son of a Karbala policeman  to America for heart surgery or fighting to secure death benefits  for the  family of his murdered interpreter or  organizing a charity to fund medical  care for Iraqi children. In his duty as a  liaison between the Army and the Government  of  Karbala  Province,  he  proved every day his dedication to the  Iraqi people; the Governor of Karbala  praised him as ‘‘a soldier and a statesman.’’  But  the virtues we  saw  in Brian  shone through even clearer to those  who loved him: Charlotte, his wife; his  3-year-old  son Gunnar  and  his  14-  month-old daughter Ingrid; his father  Randy and his stepmother Kathy; his  mother and his stepfather, Kathleen  and Albert Snyder. ‘‘Brian is a beautiful man,’’ his mother-in-law, Ginny  Mills, wrote to me shortly after his  death.  ‘‘He is loving, funny, and intelligent.  He had a spirit in him that saw the  good in life. A man who put his life on  the line to help those less fortunate  than himself. A man who was a loving  husband and a devoted father. A man  whose daughter will never know him  first-hand.’’  In the place of a husband and father  who will never see his children grow  up, Brian Freeman’s young family will  have to live on with the warm memories of the man who loved them and  who risked his life in the service of his  country. Memories and words of comfort are so insufficient, so small, next  to the flesh and blood. But there is  nothing else to put in their place.  I have nothing else to add—except to  note that the scenes of grief and comfort in the home of Charlotte Freeman  have played themselves out, in some  form or another, 3,000 times, in 3,000  families, for 3,000 lives. ‘‘Each story is  the same,’’ wrote Ginny Mills. ‘‘A wonderful, beautiful soul sacrificed.’’  ‘‘I cannot understand that this war  goes on and on,’’ she wrote. ‘‘It has to  stop. It has to stop now and I need to  know how to do that.’’  May God send comfort to her and to  all of Captain Freeman’s family and to  every family that is bereaved. And may  we remember, in every hour of our deliberations, the young lives that bear  the burden of the choices we make in  this Chamber.  f  COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL  RESOURCES  RULES  OF  PROCEDURE  ",2007

252,125,2007-01-24,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President, I today  introduce legislation that, if enacted,  will help ensure that returning servicemembers receive the care they need  from VA in the 5 years immediately  following detachment or deactivation,  without having to meet strict eligibility rules. The changes this legislation would make will contribute to the  ‘‘seamless’’ transition of military personnel from active duty to veteran status. This legislation is identical to the  bill I introduced last Congress.  Today, any active duty servicemember who  is discharged or  separated  from active duty following deployment  to a theater of combat—including Reservists or Guard who stand down but  remain on reserve duty—is eligible for  VA health care for a 2-year period. In  my view, it is vital that this period be  extended to 5 years to provide a more  appropriate window of time for servicemembers to access VA care. Since the  start of OEF and OIF, an average of  157,800 servicemembers have been discharged or deactivated per year. This  legislation will help the existing 315,600  veterans who have been  inactive  for  more than 2 years but fewer than 5, and  thousands more in the future.  Following the first Persian Gulf War,  and partially in response to the unexplained  illnesses  among  those who  served, Congress enacted the Veterans  Programs Enhancement Act of  1998.  This law gave 2 years of priority eligibility for health care to any veteran  who served in a theater of combat following discharge or deactivation from  active duty. The original intent was to  ensure health care for servicemembers  after their active duty health care benefits ended. It is now clear this the 2  year window of eligibility is insufficient.  There are two primary reasons to  amend the law to allow a greater period  of  eligibility:  protection  from  budget cuts and access to care for conditions, including mental health conditions, that may not be readily apparent  when a servicemember first leaves active duty. In recent years, funding for  VA health care has been delayed or cut  by the legislative and appropriations  processes, leading to delayed or denied  care to those veterans with lower priority for VA care. Those veterans who  have served in a theater of combat operations deserve to have their health  care guaranteed for at least the first 5  years immediately following their discharge or detachment.  With regard to mental health, 2 years  is often insufficient time for symptoms  related to PTSD and other mental illnesses to manifest. In many cases, it  takes years  for  such  symptoms  to  present themselves, and many servicemembers  do  not  immediately  seek  care. Experts predict that up to 30 percent of OEF/OIF servicemembers will  need some type of readjustment services. Five years would provide a bigger  window to address these risks. We face  a growing group of recently discharged  veterans, and this legislation will help  smooth their transition to civilian life.  One final reason, that I believe this  legislation is necessary, is that extending the window of eligibility for VA  health care services may also serve to  prevent homelessness among veterans.  We all know that veterans represent a  disproportionate segment of the homeless population, and that is a national  tragedy. While we continue to battle  homelessness  among  older  veterans  from Vietnam and other conflicts, we  must do all we can to ensure that none  of the new veterans returning  from  Iraq and Afghanistan fall through the  cracks. Providing more time for them  to access VA’s services is a key part of  that effort.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, as I believe it is truly a  way to honor the service of our men  and women in uniform.  By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself,  Mr. DURBIN, Mr. GRAHAM, and  Mr. KERRY):  S. 384. A bill to provide pay protection for members of the Reserve and  the National Guard, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.  ",2007
253,125,2007-01-24,Ms. LANDRIEU.," Mr. President, today  there are 91,555 members of the National Guard and our Reserve armed  forces serving bravely in Iraq, Afghanistan, and any other part of the world  our country calls them to serve. The  President  is  sending  an  additional  21,500 troops to Iraq in one final push  to bring stability to that country. Regardless of what we think about this  plan, Americans stand by our troops.  They have  the best equipment and  training for their mission and we would  never deny  them  the  support  they  need. But back at home, there is still a  great deal that we can do to support  our guard and reserves families.  When guardsmen and reservists are  deployed  they  leave  their  families,  their jobs, and their communities behind, causing tremendous stress on the  home front and in the workplace. Families often lose the main bread winner  when a citizen soldier gets deployed.  They may have trouble paying bills,  the rent, the mortgage, or buying medicine for their children.  The  reason  these  families  cannot  make ends meet is because for Guardsmen and Reservists military pay  is  often less than civilian pay. We call  that the ‘‘pay gap.’’ According to the  most recent Status Forces Survey of  Reserve Components, 51 percent of our  citizen soldiers take a pay cut when  they get deployed and 11 percent of  them lose more than $2,500 per month.  To help provide relief from the pay  gap for our Guard and Reserve, I am  pleased to introduce, along with Senators DURBIN, GRAHAMand KERRY, the  Helping Our Patriotic Employers at  Helping our Military Employees Act of  2007. I call the bill by its nickname:  HOPE at HOME. Our guard and reserve  families have enough to worry about  when a loved one gets called away, the  least we can do is relieve some of their  financial worry by encouraging employers to make up the pay gap. Let  me describe for my colleagues how this  legislation works.

255,132,2007-01-24,Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.," Mr. President, first of all, I thank the senior  Senator from Virginia for his considerable work in drafting this resolution  and working over the weekend with us  and our staffs, who worked very closely  together to prepare this Iraq resolution.  I think it is important to say as well  that I respect the work done by the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee  today  in  considering  the  resolution  submitted by, supported by their chairman, the distinguished Senator from  Delaware, ",2007
256,132,2007-01-24,Mr. BIDEN.," I have a great  deal of  respect  for Senator BIDEN’s  work.  This is an area where there can be  more than one idea about how to approach something, but at the end of the  day, it is going to be important to have  a resolution that has broad bipartisan  support.  I also appreciate the work of Senator  COLLINS, who, as our colleague, has  worked very closely on this resolution  together with her staff to be able to  submit it today in this fashion by putting it not only into the RECORDbut on  the floor so it can become part of the  business of the Senate.  There will be some who would say:  Why is there a need for a second resolution? Well, this resolution offers a new  set of ideas, more broadly worded, and  in some cases, clearly, more likely to  be bipartisan for Senators to consider.  Given the fact that the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee resolution came  out on  largely a partisan vote, we  think  this  resolution, because  it  is  picking up bipartisan support, will be,  in terms of content and support, consistent with an effort to bring about a  bipartisan resolution with broad support.  The  recommendations of  the  Iraq  Study Group have not been followed to  any significant extent to date. In some  respects, they have been almost on a  skyhook  for  future consideration.  It  was our feeling that many of these recommendations of the Baker-Hamilton  study group should be included in a  resolution, and we included many of  those recommendations in the body of  our resolution.  We also worked very carefully  to  avoid political rhetoric or any kind of  rhetoric that threatens the real objective. The real objective of this resolution is to stress to the White House  that we disagree with the approach  this plan takes by putting more men  and women in our uniform in harm’s  way to fight, to do battle, to overcome  the sectarian violence and the possible  civil war of the Sunnis and the Shias  and various subgroups within those religious and political elements. We also  believed  it was  important  to  stress  benchmarks and to empower the Prime  Minister and the Iraqi Government to  be able to meet certain objectives, certain goals, and to be able to deliver.  At the end of the day, we think it is  important to send a strong but unified  message to the White House and Iraq.  The more support the resolution receives in the Senate, the stronger our  message will be. So tonight I am very  pleased and am certainly proud to be  here with my colleagues to say that at  the  end of  the day, we  think  the  strength of this resolution to uphold  our responsibility will be in the best  interests of our country and our military and that our colleagues should  join together with us in opposition to  the surge of U.S. troops to be placed in  Baghdad. It is the responsibility of the  Iraqi Government and the Iraqi military to overcome the battles between  sectarian  groups within  their  own  country and to seek less of a military  resolution and certainly more of a political resolution to the problems that  exist at the present time.  With that, let me say that I would  like to see our unanimous consent be  modified to include up to 10 minutes  for Senator SALAZAR from Colorado to  speak on the resolution afterward, if  there is no objection.

So Members should  be on notice there will be a vote at approximately 10:30 tomorrow morning,  and there will be other votes throughout the day.  I would say that we have five or six  amendments all teed up to vote on. We  have a few more things—we have one  we thought we could vote on in the  morning, but we could not get the person offering the amendment on the minority side to allow us to go forward.  We hope we can work that out either  later tonight or in the morning.  We would like to move through this  bill, but we cannot do that unless people are willing to let us vote on their  amendments. So after the vote tomorrow at 10:30, hopefully we will have  more to tell the body as to what votes  have been able to be lined up for later  in the day.  Everyone should know that it is unlikely there will be any votes  from  about 1 to 2 o’clock tomorrow. Other  than that, everything is fair game.  f  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY,  JANUARY 25, 2007  ",2007

276,195,2007-01-24,Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania.," Mr.  Speaker,  I am pleased  today  to  rise once  again with my colleagues to recognize the students, teachers, faculty and graduates of our  nation’s Catholic Schools.  As Bishop Donald Wuerl has stated ‘‘Catholic schools are a  tremendous asset  to our  Church and our nation.’’ What graduates of  Catholic Schools offer to society is not only a  commitment to achieving academic excellence  but also of service to the community. These  are traits I learned at an early age as a student at St. Barnabas Elementary School and  Walsh Jesuit High School and I greatly value  both my Catholic and public school education.  For  instance, 86 schools, along with parishes,  youth ministry and CCD programs,  raised more than $300,000 over the last nine  years in support of the ‘‘Kids Share A Lunch  Nutrition Project’’ for the Pittsburgh diocesan  mission in Chimbote, Peru.  This  year’s  theme  for Catholic Schools  Week  (January 28–February 3)  is  ‘‘Catholic  Schools: The Good News in Education,’’ and  the good news is strong in Pennsylvania. With  a 15 to 1 student/teacher ratio, more than 97  percent of high school graduates from Pennsylvania’s Catholic Schools  (including both  Catholic and non-Catholics) went on to a post-  secondary education following graduation.  This year, Catholic schools in the Diocese  of Pittsburgh celebrate 178 years of quality  education.  Pennsylvania  alone,  has  650  Catholic  schools with  over  180,951 High  School and elementary students. (47,079 High  School Students:  133,872  elementary  students).  Dr. Robert Paserba, Pittsburgh diocesan superintendent of schools has stated  ‘‘parents  are choosing our schools because they teach  strong moral values in a disciplined environment—clearly a recipe for helping all children  in our schools achieve their highest potential.  As with our schools themselves, our graduates  become a source of hope for the world.’’  I believe Catholic schools do promote social  awareness and help make the world a better  place  to  live.  I am pleased  to commend all  those who teach and are students of Catholic  schools.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF THE RETIREMENT OF JUDGE SAM MONK  HON.

277,195,2007-01-24,Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.," Madam Speaker,  I respectfully ask the attention of the House  today to pay recognition to Judge Sam Monk  who is retiring after 28 years of service. Judge  Monk currently presides as Circuit Judge of  the Seventh Judicial Circuit in Anniston, Alabama.  Judge Sam Monk graduated from the University of Alabama School of Law  in 1975.  Prior to law school, Judge Monk served in the  United States Army. Judge Monk has worked  in both private practice and has served as  Presiding Judge  for  the 7th Judicial Circuit,  Circuit Judge for the 7th Judicial Circuit, and  as District Judge  for Calhoun and Cleburne  Counties.  Judge Monk will officially retire on January  15, 2007, but a reception in his honor will be  held on January 12, 2007 at  the Calhoun  County Courthouse.  I salute Judge Monk and congratulate him  on his service to the legal field over the past  28 years. I wish him all the best on this important occasion.  f  ACADEMY NOMINEES FOR 2007  HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN  OFNEWJERSEY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 24, 2007  ",2007
278,195,2007-01-24,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Madam Speaker,  every year, more high school seniors from the  11th Congressional District  trade  in varsity  jackets  for Navy pea coats, Air Force  flight  suits, and Army brass buckles than most other  districts  in  the country. But  this  is nothing  new—our area has repeatedly sent an above  average portion of its sons and daughters to  the nation’s military academies for decades.  This  fact should not come as a surprise.  The educational excellence of area schools is  well known and has long been a magnet for  families  looking  for  the best environment  in  which  to raise  their children. Our graduates  are skilled not only in mathematics, science,  and social studies, but also have solid backgrounds  in sports, debate  teams, and other  extracurricular activities. This diverse upbringing makes military academy recruiters sit up  and take note—indeed, many recruiters know  our towns and schools by name.  Since  the 1830’s, Members of Congress  have enjoyed meeting, talking with, and nominating these superb young people to our military academies. But how did  this process  evolve?  In 1843, when West Point was  the  sole academy, Congress  ratified  the nominating process and became directly involved  in the makeup of our military’s leadership. This  was not an act of an imperial Congress bent  on controlling every aspect of Government.  Rather,  the procedure still used  today was,  and is, a further check and balance in our democracy. It was originally designed to weaken  and divide political coloration  in  the officer  corps, provide geographical balance  to our  armed services, and to make the officer corps  more  resilient  to  unfettered  nepotism  and  handicapped European armies.  In 1854, Representative Gerritt Smith of  New York added a new component  to  the  academy nomination process—the academy  review board. This was the first time a Member of Congress appointed prominent citizens  from his district to screen applicants and assist with the serious duty of nominating candidates for academy admission. Today, I am  honored to continue this wise tradition in my  service to the 11th Congressional District.  The Academy Review Board is composed of  six local citizens, several of whom are distinguished veterans, who have shown exemplary  service to New Jersey, to their communities,  and to the continued excellence of education  in our area. Though from diverse backgrounds  and professions,  they all share a common  dedication  that  the best qualified and motivated graduates attend our academies. And,  as true for most volunteer groups, their service  goes largely unnoticed.  I would like to take a moment to recognize  these men and women and thank them publicly  for participating  in  this  important panel.  Being on the Board requires hard work and an  objective mind. Members have the responsibility of interviewing upwards of 50 outstanding  high school seniors every year in the academy  review process.  The nomination process  follows a general  timetable. High school seniors mail personal  information directly  to  the Military Academy,  the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy,  and the Merchant Marine Academy once they  become interested in attending. Information includes academic achievement, college entry  test scores, and other activities. At this time,  they also inform my office of their desire to be  nominated.  The academies then assess the applicants,  rank them based on the data supplied, and return the files to my office with their notations.  In late November, our Academy Review Board  interviews all of the applicants over the course  of two days. They assess a student’s qualifications and analyze character, desire to serve,  and other  talents  that may be hidden on  paper.  This year  the board  interviewed 38 applicants. Nominations included 19 to the Naval  Academy, 9 to the Military Academy and 5 to  the Air Force Academy—the Coast Guard  Academy does not use  the Congressional  nomination  process. The  recommendations  are then forwarded to the academies by January 31, where admissions staff reviewed files  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:08 Jan 25, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A24JA8.022 E24JAPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 1 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

281,2,2007-02-01,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, the  majority leader mentioned the baseball  career of my colleague from Kentucky,  JIMBUNNING, and we are immensely  proud of him in the Commonwealth of  Kentucky, not only as a great U.S.  Senator but also somebody who  literally put our State on the map during  his athletic career.  I might say to these young pages  here, Senator BUNNING is not only a  hall of famer in baseball, he is a hall of  famer in life. He has 9 wonderful children,  35 grandchildren, maybe  even  some beyond that. So it is an extraordinary Kentucky family, and I wish to  acknowledge with gratitude the observations the majority leader made of  my colleague, Senator BUNNING.  f  NOMINATIONS AND IRAQ  ",2007
282,2,2007-02-01,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, I  also wish to thank the majority leader  for his remarks about circuit court  judges. We all know the confirmation  of circuit court judges became unnecessarily,  it seems to me and  I think  seems to him, contentious at various  times in recent years. I think we are  off to a good start this year.  Each of  the  last  three Presidents  ended his term with the U.S. Senate in  the hands of the opposition party. Each  of these last three Presidents received  an average of 17 circuit court judicial  confirmations during those last 2 years  even though the Senate was  in the  hands of the opposition party.  As Senator REIDhas indicated, the  President has not  forwarded  several  nominations that were contentious in  the last session, and I thank the majority leader for his indication that we  will move forward with Randy Smith,  who is the nominee for the Ninth Circuit, before the Lincoln recess. That is  an indication of good faith on his part,  which is greatly appreciated by me and  others on our side.  With regard to Iraq, as the majority  leader indicated, we continue to be in  discussions about how to craft that debate. We certainly agree the debate  will occur next week, and we are trying  to  reach a consent agreement  that  would allow us to have several different options that would reflect the  sentiment of most Members of the Senate about the current situation in Iraq  and the decision to go forward and try  to quiet the capital city of Baghdad. So  those  discussions  will  continue  throughout the day.  With that, Mr. President, I yield the  floor.  f  RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, leadership time is reserved.  f  MORNING BUSINESS  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there  will now be a period for the transaction  of morning business until 11:45 a.m.,  with  Senators  permitted  to  speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each, with  the first 30 minutes under the control  of the Republicans and the second 30  minutes under the control of the majority.  The Senator from Kentucky.  f  ROLE OF AMERICAN DIPLOMACY  ",2007
283,2,2007-02-01,Mr.  BUNNING.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the majority leader and the minority leader for their nice words. They  might disagree on certain issues, but I  am glad they agree on one thing—that  I finally made it to the U.S. Senate  after spending 12 years in the House  and did have a private and professional  life prior to service here in the Federal  Government. I thank both Senators.  As we prepare to discuss the war in  Iraq, I would like to take a couple of  minutes to discuss the issue of personal  responsibility, civility, and the role of  American diplomacy.  Since the founding of our great Nation, we have had a long and proud tradition of international diplomacy. Our  diplomacy  has  taken many  forms,  whether it is through official state visits or through  less  formal channels,  such as congressional delegations traveling to individual countries. What we  all need to remember is that when we  are on a trip to a foreign country, we  act as American diplomats. This  is  something which I would like my colleagues to remember, especially when  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:27 Jul 29, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\S01FE7.REC S01FE 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2007

286,16,2007-02-01,Mr. KENNEDY.," Madam President, I  support the bipartisan compromise legislation on Iraq. I urge my colleagues  to support it as well. It is a stunning  repudiation  of  the President’s misguided strategy in Iraq, and it will put  the Senate squarely on record in opposition to the surge. It is a clarion call  for change and a vote of no confidence  in the President’s failed policy.  It was wrong  for the President to  take the country to war when we did,  the way we did, and for the false reasons we were given. It is wrong to compound that mistake now by sending  tens of thousands of additional American troops into the middle of a civil  war now taking place.  The American people oppose this escalation. Many generals oppose it. A  bipartisan majority of Congress opposes it as well. I especially commend  our colleague, Senator WARNER, for his  extraordinary  service  to  the Nation  and making this compromise possible.  Could  our message  to  the White  House be any louder or clearer? I intend, however, to press for binding action that will prevent the surge, unless  the President changes course.  If he  doesn’t, I will seek a vote at the first  appropriate opportunity. It  is wrong  for the President to escalate this war  and send more American soldiers into  the cauldron of civil war.  We are very hopeful that through the  course of the afternoon we are going to  be finally able to get a vote on the increase in the minimum wage from $5.15  to $7.25 an hour. This is the 9th day we  have been on this particular legislation. We have had over $240 billion  worth of increased tax preferences that  have  been  suggested  and  recommended—always on the increase on  the minimum wage.

At the final  moments here, I, first of all, thank my  friend and colleague  from Wyoming,  Senator ENZI,  for his willingness to  work together. We do not always agree,  but we agree more often  than one  might expect, and we have gotten good  things done in our committee.  I always enjoy working with him. We  have had  some  differences  on  this  issue, but we always know we have a  good deal of respect for each other; I  certainly for him. I know it is not appropriate to make personal comments  on the floor of the Senate, but I am, in  any event. It is Senator ENZI’s birthday  today, and we wish him the very best  on this particular occasion.  ",2007
291,30,2007-02-01,Mr. ENZI., Thank you.  ,2007
292,30,2007-02-01,Mr. KENNEDY.," Just finally, I think  those of us who are in this Chamber  understand we want to be one country  with one history and one destiny. We  want to make sure that for all people,  in all parts of our Nation, they are  going to have a part of the American  dream. We, as a nation, do not want to  have a subclass, a subclass of workers  who cannot emerge out of a minimum  wage for themselves or for their families. We recognize that work has to  pay.  What we are trying to do with the increase in the minimum wage is to say  to men and women of dignity—primarily to women because women are  the greatest recipients of the minimum  wage, to their families and their children, to men and women of color—that  we understand if you work hard in the  country that has the strongest economy in the world, you should not have  to live in poverty. You should not have  to live in poverty. And raising the minimum wage is going to help to make  sure that particularly those children—  those 6 million children—are going to  have a more hopeful future.  Additionally, we want to send a very  important message to all of those children. This is really just the beginning.  We have a change in direction in this  country, as we have seen in the House  of Representatives and here in the Senate. And we want to give assurances to  those families that hopefully are going  to get some boost  in the minimum  wage that we are going to work on the  education for those children. We are  going to work to make sure they are  going to get the kind of help and assistance so that education is going to  be available to them. We are going to  work to make sure we get a reauthorization of the SCHIP program, an expansion of the Medicaid Programs, because we want to make sure they are  going to be healthy, they are going to  have the opportunities for education.  We are going to make sure as well, to  the extent we can, they are going to be  able to live in safe and secure neighborhoods.  We have a responsibility in this country of ours to make sure—particularly  for children  in this Nation, but  for  workers  in  this country—that  their  work  is going to be recognized, respected, and they are going to be treated justly and fairly. That is what the  minimum wage  is all about. It  is a  moral  issue, as the members of the  church have all told us about. And we,  hopefully, will get a resounding vote of  support for a long-awaited increase in  the minimum wage.  ",2007
293,30,2007-02-01,Mr. KENNEDY.," Madam President, we  have now spent 8 long days debating  whether to raise the minimum wage by  $2.10 per hour. During this time, we  have had quite a bit to say about quite  a variety of  issues. We have talked  about education. We have talked about  heath care. We have talked about tax  policy  and  immigration  policy. We  have actually talked very little about  raising the minimum wage.  We have not had nearly enough debate about what this bill would actually do, so I can honestly say that I am  pleased when my colleagues on  the  other side of the aisle come down the  floor with the intent of actually talking about the Fair Minimum Wage Act.  Unfortunately, while I applaud them  for addressing the issue at hand, their  criticisms of the Fair Minimum Wage  Act are woefully misplaced. My Republican colleagues are perpetuating some  of the most common misconceptions  about raising the minimum wage, and  it  is  important  to  set  the  record  straight.  My colleague from Tennessee, Senator ALEXANDER, raised concerns about  the private sector costs of raising the  minimum wage. He argued that an increase will prove detrimental to the  economy in general, or to the business  community in specific. He is correct  that the Congressional Budget Office  has estimated that the bill will cost  the private sector more than $10 billion  over 5 years. However, this is a mere  drop in the bucket of the national payroll. All Americans combined earn $5.4  trillion a year. A minimum wage increase to $7.25 would be less than one-  fifth of 1 percent of this national payroll—far too trivial to cause inflation  or other economic harm.  The simple fact is that employers can  afford to increase wages in the current  economy. Workers are producing more,  but earning less. Productivity has increased by 31 percent since 1997, yet  minimum-wage workers have not received a raise. This increase ensures  that minimum-wage workers, not just  employers, benefit from the fruits of  their labor.  Now Senator ALEXANDER also suggests that we shouldn’t interfere with  the market forces that set wages for  low-wage workers. But we need to intervene when there’s a market failure  that needs correcting, and that’s clearly the case with our stagnant minimum wage. Low-skilled workers, unlike high-skilled workers, do not generally have the bargaining power to demand wage  increases. Even  if  they  work harder, all their extra efforts are  going  into profits. Corporate profits  have grown by 80 percent since Bush  took office, while wages are stagnant.  We need to act to make sure minimum  wage workers don’t get left behind.  My colleague also expresses concern  about the effect of a minimum wage on  small business. He claims that the majority of minimum wage workers are  employed by small businesses, and that  small businesses will suffer if the minimum wage is raised.  But the small business community  doesn’t agree. A  recent Gallup poll  found that 80 percent of small business  owners do not think that the minimum  wage affects their business, and three  out of four small businesses said that a  10 percent  increase  in the minimum  wage would have no effect on their  company. Additionally, nearly half of  small business owners think that the  minimum wage should be  increased,  and only 16 percent of owners think the  minimum wage should be reduced or  eliminated entirely.  In fact, historical evidence suggests  that a minimum wage increase can actually be beneficial to small business.  A 2005 study by the Fiscal Policy Institute found States with minimum wages  above the Federal level are generating  more small businesses than states with  a minimum wage at the Federal level.  Between 1998 and 2003, the number of  small businesses rose 5.4 percent in the  ten States,  including at had a minimum wage higher than the Federal  level, compared to 4.2 percent in the  other 40 States. The number of small  retail businesses also grew  faster  in  these States.  I  appreciate Senator ALEXANDER’s  concerns about the economic impacts  of a minimum wage raise, those concerns  are misguided.

307,51,2007-02-01,Mr. PRYOR.," Mr. President, In reflection of the New Year, I have thought  about what I wanted my New Year’s  resolution to be. I had a wonderful holiday that I was fortunate to spend with  my family, and I thought about those  in the world who did not have that  same opportunity. World peace is our  ambition, but, today I want to speak  about  our  hope  for  the  people  of  Darfur, Sudan.  I rise to add my voice, and that of my  constituency, on the crisis in Darfur.  Everyday I hear from Arkansans concerned about the escalating chaos and  destruction  happening  in  Darfur.  Whether it is through church groups,  schools, the newspaper, Internet, or the  television, the reports from Darfur are  shocking  and  disturbing.  Darfur,  Sudan, is 7,117 miles away from Little  Rock, AR, but it is not removed from  the thoughts and prayers of our citizens.  The  statistics  on  this  crisis  are  heartbreaking. It has been estimated  that between 200,000 and 400,000 people  have  been killed  and  thousands  of  women have been raped. Over 2 million  people have been displaced. Their lives  have been completely uprooted, and  their only chance of survival is refugee  camps. These makeshift camps provide  little shelter and are subjected to raids  by armed militias. Aid workers and organizations have recently pulled out of  the region due to safety concerns, and  the conflict is spreading to neighboring  countries,  destabilizing  governments  that may be ill-equipped to integrate  an influx of refugees. Moreover, the Sudanese  government  has  restricted  media and diplomatic access to the region.  While the United States has taken  considerable actions to support an end  to the horrible violence in Darfur, the  situation  continues  to  deteriorate.  Darfur  is the world’s crisis, and we  must do more to ensure that an effective peacekeeping force is in place to  stem the escalating rape, murder, and  destruction.  I am hopeful that the United Nations’ most recent effort will work. I  am encouraged that so many humanitarian organizations have worked tirelessly to find a resolution to this matter. It is my wish that peace and stability will come to Darfur in 2007.  The people of Darfur have been deprived of the most basic of human liberties: the right to live in peace. It is  our responsibility as U.S. Senators, as  Americans, and as humanitarians to do  all that we can to bring about an end  to this world crisis.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  USC-RIVERSIDE CITRUS RESEARCH  CENTER  ∑",2007
308,51,2007-02-01,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, today I  ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 100 years of groundbreaking research and education at the University  of California Riverside’s Citrus Research  Center—Agricultural  Experiment Station. This year, the university  celebrates a century of improving our  Nation’s agriculture, environment, and  natural resources.  The idea behind the creation of a citrus experiment center began with the  pioneering work of Riverside  citrus  grower John Henry Reed, who first proposed the idea in 1900. At the time Riverside was the hub of a rapidly expanding citrus industry, in part because refrigeration made nationwide shipments  possible. His proposal became a reality  in 1905 when the California Legislature  passed a measure authorizing the establishment of the Citrus Experiment  Station in Riverside. By 1907, the Citrus Experiment Station  became  an  open branch of the Statewide Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of California.  From that time on, the Citrus Experiment Station continued to grow and  develop, to become one of California’s  premier agricultural research institutions. In 1914, the station maintained a  staff of 18 with an annual budget of  $60,000. Over the next 40 years, the Experiment Station’s research area grew  from 30 acres to almost 1,000 acres, and  staff grew to 265.  During that time, Leon D. Bachelor,  as director, worked to initiate many of  the  long-term  fertilizer  experiments  and worked to ensure the strength of  the walnut  industry through disease  research. During his tenure, shipping  and processing of produce was vastly  improved, and improvements were implemented in citrus rootstocks, disease  resistance, and fruit quality.  While this was taking place, facilities and physical plant construction  continued to increase as more research  stations and research buildings were  being built. In 1954 Weber Hall was constructed, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Boyden Entomological Laboratory was built in 1961, and research  property increased to 1,100 acres. There  were also advances in research focus,  beginning in 1955 with the arrival of a  vegetable crops group from UC Davis.  During the next year, the Department  of Nematology and  the Biometrical  Laboratory were  established. Work  also came from UCLA focusing on entomology  and  plant  pathology  on  ornamentals.  Just after this, the Air Pollution Research Center was established on the  UC Riverside campus, and agronomists  from Davis were welcomed to join in  the research efforts. A Dry Lands Research Institute was added in 1963, and  in the year following, the UC Riverside  campus added a Department of Agricultural Engineering. The year after this,  the Department of Agronomy accepted  further work  from UCLA  on  turf  grasses.  With the expansion of research into  all of these areas, it became clear that  the university did not simply research  citrus, and the Citrus Experiment Station was appropriately  renamed  the  Citrus Research Center and Agricultural Experiment Station, CRC–AES,  in 1961. A full college devoted to this  research effort was added in 1974, establishing  the College of Natural and  Agricultrual Sciences.  Today, UC Riverside agricultural and  natural science researchers pave the  way for many of our Nation’s important  scientific advances. Studies  in  plant sciences and environmental and  natural resources continue to improve  the quality of life for our Nation and  our planet. As the Citrus Research Center—Agricultural Experiment Station  at the University of California, Riverside celebrates  its centennial,  I applaud the tremendous efforts and advances and  look  forward to another  century of progress.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO 2006 KENTUCKY  DERBY WINNER BARBARO  ∑",2007
309,51,2007-02-01,Mr. BUNNING.," Mr. President, today I  wish  to pay  tribute  to  the  life of  Barbaro,  the  2006 Kentucky Derby  Champion. He was an inspirational survivor and was beloved by the State of  Kentucky. Barbaro’s motivational rise  to the top of horse racing history and  relentless fight for his life against all  odds, serves as a shining example of  strength and courage to us all.  Barbaro first entered this world on  April 29, 2003, when he was foaled in  Nicholasville,  KY,  at  Springmint  Farm. He is the son of the great champion  racehorse Dynaformer and was  destined to be a champion from the beginning.  Barbaro was always a favorite of the  crowd, but it was his performance at  the Kentucky Derby, May 6, 2006, that  would make him a legend. He ended up  winning the Derby with a lead of seven  lengths, which was the largest margin  of victory since 1946. Because of this  spectacular race, many people believed  Barbaro was destined for greatness in  the horse racing industry and favored  him to go on to win the Triple Crown  of Thoroughbred Racing.  Later that same year, Barbaro ran  the Preakness Stakes on May 20, 2006,  as the crowd favorite. After an initial  false start through the starting gate  and signs of distress early on in the  race, it was clear that Barbaro had sustained  a  severe  injury. Laboratory  tests  showed  that he had  fractured  three bones in and around his ankle  and right hind leg.

311,65,2007-02-01,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, it’s a  privilege to join my colleague, Senator  in  introducing  the Student  Loan Sunshine Act, to provide greater  support  for  students  and  families  across America who  are  struggling  with great difficulty to pay for college.  Over the past 20 years, the cost of attending college has doubled. Today, the  average cost of attendance at a 4-year  public college is almost $13,000. As a result, students and families are going  deeper and deeper into debt to finance  the cost of higher education. In 1993,  fewer than a third of students at four-  year colleges graduated with debt to  pay on their student loans. Today that  number has doubled. Two-thirds of students now graduate with student loan  debt.  The average debt load has soared as  well. In the past decade,  it has  increased by 57 percent at public colleges  and  38 percent at private  colleges.  Today, the typical graduate leaves college saddled with $17,000  in student  loans.  Nowhere has this growth been more  pronounced  than  in private  student  loans. Until recently, most students  who borrowed  for  college  took out  loans under the Direct Loan program  and  the Federal Family Education  Loan program—the two main student  loan programs subsidized by the Federal Government.  With the cost of college rising rapidly and grant aid stagnating, however,  more and more students are turning to  the private loan sector and are taking  out so-called ‘‘alternative loans’’—private loans that lenders offer through  colleges and universities. Students are  also borrowing  increasingly  from direct-to-consumer  education  lenders,  which  include giant  lenders such as  Sallie Mae that also participate in the  FFEL program, as well as other companies  that  just  offer  private-market  loans, such as Loan to Learn.  A  decade  ago,  private  loans  accounted for only 3 percent of all funds  used  to  finance  students’  post-secondary education. Since then, the volume of private loans has grown by an  astronomical 1200 percent. Today, private loans now total $17 billion, and  represent 20 percent of all borrowing  for higher education.  Many lenders making these private  loans claim they’re providing an important service. They say that at a  time when college prices are rising rapidly, they provide needed funds to help  students pay for college.  What they won’t tell you is the exorbitant cost that countless students are  paying for these loans. Unlike loans offered  through  the  federal programs,  private  loans  frequently carry much  higher  interest  rates,  especially  for  students without credit histories and  families without strong credit ratings.  In some cases, the interest rates on private loans may be as high as 19 percent  a year, compared to 6.8 percent  for  loans offered through the FFEL and  Direct Loan programs.  The lenders also don’t tell you about  the aggressive tactics they use to persuade colleges to offer private loans to  their students—and to persuade students to borrow directly as well.  The private company Student Loan  Xpress has offered 100 percent loan approval at colleges if the college agrees  to ‘‘brand’’ the private loan with the  college’s name and emblem—making  the loan appear to be offered by the  college, not the private lender.  Other private loan companies encourage borrowers not to fill out the Free  Application for Federal Student Aid,  which allows borrowers to obtain loans  at  lower  interest  rates. They don’t  prominently  disclose  the  fact  that  their interest rates are typically much  higher.  Some lenders make gifts to college  and  university  employees. Loan  to  Learn  invited  college  officials  and  their spouses to an all-expenses paid  ‘‘education conference’’ in the West Indies. Many lenders who participate in  the FFEL program offer similar ‘‘educational conferences’’ at fancy hotels,  and offer free entertainment and tickets to sporting events to college officials. The Attorney General  in New  York State has opened an investigation  into such practices and is looking into  the practices of six lenders, including  Sallie Mae, Nelnet, and Educap, the  corporate name of Loan to Learn.  We need to take immediate steps to  stop  actions  that  prevent  students  from obtaining the best  loan agreement possible. That is what the Student Loan Sunshine Act does.  First and foremost, it is a consumer  protection measure. It will protect student and parent borrowers by ending  the inappropriate lender practices I’ve  just mentioned.  It prohibits lenders from offering to a  college employee any gift worth more  than $10, including free or discounted  trips, meals, invitations to entertainment events or other form of hospitality.  It prohibits  lenders  from offering  services to financial aid offices that  create a conflict of interest, such as  lending staff during peak  loan processing times. It also prohibits lenders  from ‘‘branding’’ their loans with a college name, emblem, or logo.  The Sunshine Act also arms students  and parents with the information they  need to make wise decisions when they  borrow funds for higher education.

The bill before us,  H.R. 434, was received in the Senate on  January 18. I don’t understand why the  committee has waited until the day before the program expires to act. If we  amend this bill and send it back to the  House, they will not be able to act before these programs expire.  It  is my understanding that  if we  allow this authorization to  lapse,  it  will result  in the dissolution of the  SBA’s Advisory Committee on Veterans Business Affairs.

331,72,2007-02-01,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, today we  pay our respects to a great son of Massachusetts who passed away on Sunday, an inspiration to me and a leader  beloved  by many,  Father  Robert  Drinan.  In all his life’s endeavors, from the  church pulpit to the halls of Congress  to the classroom, Father Drinan was  guided by a firm and unwavering moral  compass. He lived out in public life the  whole cloth of Catholic teachings.  In religion and politics alike, he followed his sense that we are all put on  this Earth for something greater than  ourselves. Wherever he went, he was  led there by a concern for the weak,  the helpless, the downtrodden. In religion and politics alike, that was his  calling.  And as he walked between  these  worlds, on a path unique in our Nation’s history, he was always unmistakably and wonderfully true to himself.  Father Drinan was a forever gentle,  resilient, tenacious advocate for social  justice and  fundamental decency.  In  the most divisive days of Vietnam,  when things were coming apart, this  incredible man, this most unlikely of  candidates, showed America how a man  of faith could be a man of peace.  As a politician, Father Drinan is best  remembered for his spirited opposition  to  the Vietnam war. That’s what  brought him to Congress in the first  place and  it  is how our paths  first  crossed. In 1970, after we first met as  opponents in the Peoples’ Caucus, I was  honored to support, campaign, and to  work with and learn from committed  Democrats  like  Jerome  Grossman,  John Marttila, Tom Kiley, John Hurley, and Tom Vallely. Together, many  of  these  committed activists would  spend the next decades championing  the  great  progressive  causes  that  marked the Drinan campaign.  Father Drinan’s slogan was ‘‘Father  Knows Best.’’ I began studying law at  Boston College—where Father Drinan  had been the youngest law school Dean  in  the country—while he was down  here,  in Congress, making  law, and  making history.  Father Drinan’s  testimony against  the war was remarkably powerful. He  toured jails in Saigon and met a South  Vietnamese politician there who had  been jailed after placing second in an  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:27 Jul 29, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00072 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\S01FE7.REC S01FE 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2007
332,79,2007-02-01,Mr. EMANUEL.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to congratulate Barry Rodgers on his  appointment as principal of Northside College  Preparatory High School  in Chicago. The  Northside school council voted unanimously to  name Mr. Rodgers to a 4-year term as principal beginning on July 1, 2007, and  they  chose an outstanding successor  to James  Lalley, who is retiring on June 30, 2007.  Mr. Rodgers received his B.S.  in zoology  from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in  1990. He then went on to graduate from National Louis University, in 1999, with a master’s degree in education specializing in curriculum and instruction, and he has continued  his education with a certificate in educational  leadership from DePaul University in 2005.  Throughout his career, Mr. Rodgers has  been an educator and a leader in a variety of  venues. He began his career at Mather High  School  teaching biology and chemistry. He  went on to become the department chairman  at Mather High. He then joined the Northside  science department, working his way up to department chairman  there as well. Currently,  Mr. Rodgers is the LAUNCH principal at Westinghouse Career Academy in Chicago assisting in the day-to-day operations of the school.  Mr. Rodgers has gone above and beyond in  serving the interests of the students wherever  he has taught. He founded the swim team at  Northside High School,  led  the Curriculum  Team, was a teacher-mentor for the Golden  Teachers program, coordinated staff development opportunities for five area schools, and  was a member of the leadership team at both  Northside High and Westinghouse Academy.  In addition  to coaching  the swim  team at  Northside, he is also affiliated with the Association for Supervision and Curriculum development, the National Science Teachers Association, the Friends of the Chicago River, the  National School Reform Faculty,  the North  River Commission,  the American Chemical  Society, and National Public Radio.  Madam Speaker, I congratulate Barry Rodgers on his appointment as Northside College  Preparatory High School’s new principal, and  I thank him for his many outstanding contributions  in educating  the young people of  the  Fifth District of Illinois. His efforts have had a  profound  impact on  the  lives of his  friends,  family, and countless other individuals. I wish  him the best of luck as he embarks on this  new journey, and continued happiness in all  his future endeavors.  f  HONORING MUHAMMAD ALI  HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 31, 2007  ",2007
333,79,2007-02-01,Mr. CONYERS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to support House Resolution 58 in honor  of Muhammad Ali—born Cassius Marcellus  Clay, on  the occasion of his 65th birthday.  Internationally known as  the  ‘‘greatest of all  time,’’ he single-handedly  revolutionized  the  sport of boxing.  Born on this day in 1942 in Louisville, KY,  by the age of 18, Clay had already become  the 1960 light-heavyweight Olympic Gold Medalist. It was then that he evolved into a professional fighter, and by 1963, he had won all 19  of his  first professional  fights. The  following  year, 1964, Clay won the world heavyweight  title against Sonny Liston. Two days later, he  announced his acceptance of the teachings of  the Nation of Islam and changed his name to  Muhammad Ali shortly after.  Ali defended his championship  title nine  times between 1965 and 1967, more  than  most heavyweight fighters in such a short period. Citing his  Islamic  faith, Ali  refused  to  serve  in  the U.S. military during  the war  in  Vietnam. As a result, his title was revoked, his  fighting license was suspended, and he was  sentenced to 5 years in prison for draft evasion. He was barred from fighting from March  22, 1967  to October 26, 1970, which many  feel were his peak years. Finally, in 1971, the  Supreme Court unanimously  reversed Ali’s  conviction, and his boxing privileges were restored.  Ali quickly set about regaining  the heavyweight title, which was now held by the indomitable Joe Frazier. In the first of three bouts  with Frazier, Ali  lost what was dubbed  ‘‘the  fight of the century.’’ In a rematch with Frazier  in 1974, Ali was victorious in redeeming his  championship  title.  In October of  that same  year, the fight considered to be his most anticipated and promoted of his career, was the  ‘‘rumble in the jungle’’ against a younger and  vibrant George Foreman. The fight took place  in Kinshasa, Zaire, and there were many who  doubted that Ali would emerge the victor. In  this  fight, Ali  introduced what he called  the  ‘‘rope-a-dope,’’ which he used to tire Foreman  and eventually sustain his position as the No.  1 heavyweight champion of the world.  In 1975, his  third and  final bout with Joe  Frazier, labeled the ‘‘the thrilla in Manila’’ by  Ali, proved  to be one of  the  toughest and  greatest fights of his career. Ali was victorious  once more. Sadly, in 1978, Ali lost the title to  Leon Spinks. That same year, in a rematch  with Spinks, Ali won the championship title for  the third time. In his final fight, ‘‘the drama in  Bahamas,’’ against Trevor Berbick in 1981, his  loss signaled the decline of the fighter’s reign,  and on December 12, 1981, Muhammad Ali  said goodbye  to boxing at  the age of 39.  There were also reports of his deteriorating  health, and in 1982, the world knew that he  was suffering from Parkinson’s disease.  Ali remains a beloved and active public figure. He has enjoyed countless honors, such  as becoming No. 13 of the Forbes Celebrity  100,  receiving  the Spirit of America Award  which named him the most recognized American in the world, named ‘‘Kentucky Athlete of  the Century,’’ and  lighting  the  flame at  the  1996 Summer Olympics. In 2005, Ali received  the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and  the  $60 million Muhammad Ali Center was opened  in his honor in Louisville, KY. He is a United  Nations Messenger of Peace and  the  first  sportsman  to  receive an Otto Hahn Peace  Medal. He is also the namesake of the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act.  More than a superior in the boxing world, Ali  took a stand against  injustice. He was a  champion of the civil rights movement, and an  involved activist who used his power and fame  to push noble social change. His refusal  to  fight in a war that he didn’t believe in made a  statement  to not only  the African-American  community, but to the world. Ali sacrificed boxing, the one thing he loved the most, to stand  up for that which he believed. His practice of  Islam and civil disobedience propelled him to  larger than life status. Muhammad Ali has inspired millions throughout the world. He has  given people hope and proved  that anyone  can overcome  insurmountable odds. He has  given people courage and shown us all that  with spirit and determination, a simple person  can make a difference. There will never be another Muhammad Ali.  So Madam Speaker, it is with great distinction that I stand here today to wish the champ,  the living legend, ‘‘The Greatest,’’ Muhammad  Ali, a happy birthday.

334,86,2007-02-01,Mr. COSTA.," Madam Speaker, as co-chair of  the Congressional Victims’ Rights Caucus,  I  rise  today  to  introduce  the 2007 National  Crime Victims’ Rights Week Resolution on behalf of myself and my caucus co-chair, Congressman TEDPOEof Texas. This resolution  expresses Congress’s support of  the goals  and ideals of National Crime Victims’ Rights  Week and the efforts to increase public awareness of  the  rights, needs, and concerns of  crime  victims and  survivors  in  the United  the  States. This observance will  take place  week of April 22 through April 28.  In 1980, President Reagan first called for a  national observance  to recognize and honor  the millions of crime victims and survivors in  America. National Crime Victims’ Rights Week  also pays tribute to the thousands of community-based and system-based victim services  providers and to the criminal justice and allied  professionals who provide critical support and  assistance  to  victims every day, of every  week, of every single year. National Crime  Victims’ Rights Week has since been proclaimed annually with ceremonies and observances in Washington, DC, and in thousands of  communities throughout our Nation.  President Reagan’s strong emphasis on the  rights and needs of crime victims led to the  passage of the Victims of Crime Act, which in  1984 created the Crime Victims Fund. Since  then, the Crime Victims Fund has dedicated  more  than $8 billion collected  from criminal  fines—not  taxpayers’  dollars—that  annually  supports more  than 4,400 victim assistance  programs serving some 3.8 million victims,  and compensation to more than 165,000 victims for their unreimbursed medical expenses,  lost wages and  funeral costs. The adage,  ‘‘crime doesn’t pay, victims do,’’ is challenged  by the VOCA fund, which rightfully holds offenders accountable for their criminal actions,  with fines ensuring that crime victims receive  the services and support they so greatly need  and deserve. And the Congressional Victims’  Rights Caucus has worked since its inception  to preserve  the  intent and  integrity of  the  Crime Victims Fund as created by President  Reagan nearly a quarter century ago.  The 2007 National Crime Victims’ Rights  Week theme is ‘‘Victims’ Rights: Every Victim.  Every Time.’’ Today more  than ever,  these  simple words resonate with greater importance  than ever before. In the decade between 1994  and 2004,  the National Crime Victimization  Survey found that violent crime rates declined,  reaching  the  lowest  level ever  recorded  in  2005. Unfortunately last year, the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports  reported  that crime  is,  once again, on the rise—violent crime rose 3.7  percent; murders increased 1.4 percent; robberies were up nearly 10 percent; and arson  increased by nearly 7 percent. This means  more victims than ever suffer the indignation  of crime, and have significant losses that affect  them physically, emotionally,  financially  and spiritually. Our caucus and our Congress  must  recommit our energies  to ensure  that  ‘‘every victim of every crime’’ has access to  support and services.  I know that my colleagues in Congress have  heard a great deal about violence and victimization, and have heard from those who are  directly affected:  The teenage girl who leaves home for the  first time to go to college, only to be drugged  and raped at a campus party; or the young  mother who is beaten by her husband on a  regular basis, but fears leaving him because  he’s threatened to kill her kids, and she has  no money, nor no place to go.  ‘‘Every victim. Every time.’’  Or  the elderly man—no different  from our  parents—who is abused in a nursing home; or  the parents whose only son is killed in a violent drunk driving crash.  ‘‘Every victim. Every time.’’  Or the horrific day that nobody will ever forget—September 11, 2001—when nearly 3,000  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:28 Apr 19, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD07\E01FE7.REC E01FE7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

He has proven himself a quality  writer who  fairly, accurately and completely  covers the information that is important to our  community in northwest Tennessee.  Even before coming to the State Gazette,  Bill was a distinguished scholar, journalist and  pastor. He received a Bachelor’s Degree  in  Philosophy at Transylvania College  in Lexington, Kentucky, and a Master’s Degree  in  Systematic Theology  from  the University of  Durham  in Durham, England. He has also  studied  at  Vanderbilt  University  and  the  George Peabody College for Teachers, taught  college—level writing  and  public  relations  courses and, having been ordained as a minister of  the Christian Church, Disciples of  Christ, served as pastor at several churches  throughout Tennessee. After working at  the  Associated Press and United Press  International, Bill was a general assignment  reporter  and  sports  columnist  at The Tennessean  in Nashville, Tennessee, where he  from  future Vice  once sat across  the desk  President Al Gore.  Madam Speaker, it has been a pleasure to  work alongside Bill during his long service to  Tennessee, and  I am proud  to call him my  friend.

337,93,2007-02-01,Mr. FATTAH.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to  recognize  the 150th Anniversary of  the  grand opening of Philadelphia’s Academy of  Music—our  ‘‘Grand Old  Lady  of  Locust  Street.’’ Since January 26, 1857, the Academy  has hosted more than one billion attendees at  almost half a million performances. Generations of the region’s children have sat in her  elegant auditorium and caught their breath as  the curtain rose on their first experience of an  opera or ballet performance. Millions of them  have sat up  in wonder as  they heard The  Philadelphia Orchestra’s  rousing sounds  for  the first time. Hundreds of thousands of Philadelphians have walked proudly across  the  Academy’s stage to accept their commencement certificate. Audiences and artists alike  have flocked to Philadelphia from around the  world because of the Academy of Music.–  What a  remarkable  legacy  for one building—a  legacy  that has a deeply personal  meaning for many generations of the region’s  families who share memories of attending special events within her walls; a legacy that laid  the foundation on which the city created the  Avenue of the Arts, built the shining new Kimmel Center, and made Philadelphia one of the  most vibrant cultural destinations in the world;  a legacy of which all Philadelphia—area residents can be proud.  The Academy of Music 150th Anniversary  Concert and Ball, held on January 27, 2007,  reflected many facets of the Academy’s rich  history. World—renowned artists host Tom  Brokaw, soprano Deborah Voigt,  tenor Ben  Heppner and  vocalists  John Lithgow, with  Music Director Christoph Eschenbach and our  own celebrated Philadelphia Orchestra and  Philadelphia  Singers,  presented  an  outstanding program of grand opera,  theater,  Broadway, classical and popular music.  The concert was attended by over 2,400 of  the region’s political, civic and corporate leaders as well as special guests Their Royal  Highnesses  the Prince of Wales and  the  Duchess of Cornwall. Even the Prince’s visit  has a historical precedent  in  the Academy’s  rich past: his great, great grandfather, Edward  VII, was one of the early visiting dignitaries to  grace the Academy at a gala performance by  the popular soprano Adelina Patti in 1860. The  Prince of Wales will sit  in  the same box,  dubbed ‘‘the Prince of Wales Box’’ since the  1860 visit  that his ancestor occupied before  him.  I congratulate the Academy on its sesquicentennial and  look  forward  to many more  years of important cultural contributions to our  city.

339,6,2007-02-14,Ms. GRANGER.," Mr. Speaker, on Sunday afternoon, I drove about 20 miles  to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Paul  Balint in Willow Park, Texas. I had the  solemn honor of presenting them with  congressional remarks commemorating  the noble and distinguished service of  their son, Paulie.  The parents of Captain Balint did not  complain to me or ask me to vote to  end the war. They talked about the  pride of their son and his lifetime desire to serve in the military.  The Balints have never waffled  in  their belief that the war in Iraq is one  that demands our Nation’s full commitment. They experienced a loss no  one ever wants to share. Paulie was  fighting to preserve our freedom and  our way of life.  As I wished them well and turned to  leave, the Balints asked me to bring a  message back  to Washington. They  said to tell you to stay firm because we  need to finish the job in Iraq.  So I am speaking today in memory of  Paulie and his mother and his father  and his brother and those who are still  fighting there for us and listening to  what we have to say.  I will not speak by calling into question anyone’s patriotism or motives.  All of us, Republicans and Democrats  alike, recognize that much is at stake  in Iraq and, undoubtedly, we all feel  passionately about doing our duty to  move forward and address what I consider to be the issue of our lives, the  worldwide war against terrorists and a  battleground of that war, which is Iraq.  The  issue of responsibility  in this  war has been discussed during this debate, and I believe it is an important  issue when addressing Iraq and in addressing this resolution.  b1045  Certainly in the change of direction  the President has presented, the Iraqis  have a clear responsibility to meet the  goals of  securing  their own  future.  Likewise, Congress has a clear responsibility to produce meaningful legislation and provide effective oversight of  our government’s actions, especially  during time of war.  Put another way, our citizens hold  their elected Representatives accountable to craft legislation that results in  meaningful and positive change. That  is precisely what is so disappointingly  unacceptable  about  this  nonbinding  bill, which fails to do anything, which  holds no one accountable, and does not  move our country forward on this critical issue.  Frankly, those many who have criticized the administration  for staying  the course too long are now presenting  us with a bill that is the  ‘‘stay the  course’’ piece of legislation that both  advocates failure and a position of status quo. More specifically, the bill ignores two of the most important parts  of our Nation’s role in Iraq: the consequences of failure and the principal  support that we should provide our  troops during times of war.  Let us say we do redeploy, which  means quit. Or let us say the Congress  takes the next step that is being talked  about, and that is stopping the funding  in Iraq. Let us look clearly at the consequences of a failed state in Iraq, not  only for America but for the world.  Let there be no mistake, Iraq is but  one front in a long war against a fanatical enemy who does not value human  life and who seeks to destroy those who  do. Failing to secure Iraq will result in  massive instability in the Middle East,  which will undoubtedly spill over to  the rest of the world.  Consider the fractured nature of the  Middle East and the nature of the dangerous threat we  face.  Iranian television  stations  routinely  broadcast  commercials that are designed to recruit would-be terrorists. In one ad specifically  for children, cartoon characters entice them to be suicide bombers.

340,13,2007-02-14,Mr. GILCHREST.," I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for being  generous with his time. I also want to  sincerely thank the gentleman  from  North Carolina for his effort to resolve  the issue successfully and for bringing  those of us who are speaking here this  morning together and  for organizing  this time.  Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote for  this resolution for many reasons that I  will explain, but this resolution is not  a retreat from Iraq. This resolution is  understanding the new phase that we  find ourselves in with the war in Iraq  and the war on terrorism. So it is a  step forward in the right direction.  I want to begin by commending our  American troops and the intelligence  community  for  their bravery,  their  professionalism  and  their  stunning  competence  in  Iraq and Afghanistan  under  very  difficult  circumstances.  Those young men and women have  eliminated  terrorist  training  camps  and gotten rid of Saddam Hussein and  his band of terrorists, who for years  have brutalized the Iraqi people and  many people, many thousands of people  in the region.  They have eliminated the potential  for weapons of mass destruction, these  young men and women, and we are  proud of that. The Taliban is disbanded  and al Qaeda is on the run. These are  our troops and the intelligence community.  Where are we now? We find ourselves  now, the war on Iraq, and the global  war on terrorism, in a new phase, the  President understands that phase. The  Congress is grasping with that phase.  We now know the war in Iraq is in a  new phase, and a global war on terror  continues, so how do we respond?  How do we approach this new phase?  Let’s look at the recent past. Let’s go  back  to  the  1950s. President Eisenhower said, for the United States to be  safe and secure we need a strong military, the best  intelligence, and consensus and dialogue.  President Eisenhower  implemented  all of those practices, especially after  Nikita Khrushchev pounded his shoe at  the podium of the United Nations and  pointed to the Western diplomats and  said, ‘‘we will bury you.’’  Eisenhower’s  response? He  invited  Khrushchev to the United States for a  dialogue.  President Kennedy was  told  there  were armed nuclear warheads in Cuba.  What did President Kennedy do? Proceed with dialogue and talking with  the Soviets. We did not go to war.  Nixon went to China.  Who during that period of time did  we not have a dialogue with? It was Ho  Chi Minh; 53,000 Americans died in the  Ten Thousand Day War. Hundreds of  thousands were wounded, and millions  of Vietnamese were killed. What if we  had a dialogue with Ho Chi Minh about  ending the French colonial period and  encouraging Vietnam to have self-determination, that which we fought for  in World War II? What would have happened?  Fifty-three years of dialogue with  North Korea just now may be yielding  results, 53 years of dialogue. Ask yourself this question. Is a century of dialogue without resolution better than  one day on the battlefield? Don’t be  quick to answer that, but ask that  question to yourself.  The world, rich and poor, the people  of the world, are intimately familiar  with American history, especially with  the  following man. They know  the  words of Thomas Jefferson. ‘‘We hold  these truths to be self-evident: that all  men are created equal; that they are  endowed by their Creator with certain  inalienable rights; that among these  are life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.’’  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:39 Feb 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K14FE7.020 H14FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007
341,20,2007-02-14,The SPEAKER pro tempore.," The gentleman from North Carolina has 253⁄4  minutes.  Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, this resolution 63 is first to  thank the troops for their service, and  we all support them. The second part of  the resolution is to oppose the surge.  I quote a great military general,  Colin Powell: ‘‘I am not persuaded that  another surge of troops into Baghdad  for  the purposes of  suppressing  the  communitarian violence, this civil war,  would work.’’ He supports our position.  He opposes the surge. That  is Colin  Powell.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. PAUL).  (Mr. PAUL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2007
342,20,2007-02-14,Mr. PAUL.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding, and I rise in  support of the resolution and in opposition to the escalation in Iraq. I want to  thank the gentleman from North Carolina for his very determined and principled effort to end this ill-advised and  dangerous war, and I am very pleased  that he brought together a group of  Members today who are representing  the traditional conservative position  on war and peace and I deeply appreciate that.  Mr. Speaker, this grand debate  is  welcomed, but it could be that this is  nothing more than a distraction from  the dangerous military confrontation  approaching with Iran, which is supported by many in leadership on both  sides of the aisle. This resolution, unfortunately, does not address the disaster in Iraq. Instead, it appears to oppose the war while at the same time offering no change of the status quo in  Iraq.  As such, it is not actually a vote  against a  troop  surge. A  real vote  against a troop surge is a vote against  the coming supplemental appropriation  which finances it. I hope all my colleagues who vote against this surge  today will vote against the budgetary  surge when it really counts, when we  vote on the supplemental.  The biggest red herring in this debate  is the constant  innuendo that those  who don’t support expanding the war  are somehow opposing the troops. It is  nothing more than a canard to claim  that those of us who struggled to prevent the bloodshed and now want it  stopped are somehow less patriotic and  less concerned about the welfare of our  military personnel.  Osama bin Laden has expressed sadistic pleasure with the invasion in Iraq  and was surprised that we served his  interests above and beyond his dreams  on how we responded after the 9/11 attacks. His pleasure comes from our policy of folly, getting ourselves bogged  down in the middle of a religious civil  war 7,000 miles from home that is financially bleeding us to death. Total  costs now are recently estimated to exceed $2 trillion. His recruitment of Islamic extremists has been greatly enhanced by our occupation of Iraq.  Unfortunately, we continue to concentrate on the obvious mismanagement of a war promoted by false information and ignore debating the real  issue which is this: Why are we determined to follow a foreign policy of empire building and preemption which is  unbecoming of a constitutional republic?  Those on the right should recall that  the traditional conservative position of  nonintervention was their position for  most of the 20th century, and they benefited politically from the wars carelessly entered into by the left. Seven  years ago, the right benefited politically by condemning the illegal intervention in Kosovo and Somalia. At the  time, the right was outraged over the  failed policy of nation building.  It is important to recall that the left  in 2003 offered little opposition to the  preemptive war in Iraq, and many are  now not willing to stop it by defunding  it, or work to prevent an attack on  Iran.  b1300  The catch-all phrase the ‘‘war on terrorism’’  in all honesty has no more  meaning than if one wants to wage a  war against criminal gangsterism. Terrorism is a tactic. You can’t have a war  against  a  tactic.  It  is  deliberately  vague and nondefinable in order to justify and permit perpetual war anywhere and under any circumstances.  Don’t forget, the Iraqis and Saddam  Hussein had nothing to do with any  terrorist attack against us, including  that on 9/11.  Special interests and the demented  philosophy of conquests have driven  most wars throughout all of history.  Rarely has the cause of liberty, as it  was in our own Revolution, been the  driving force. In recent decades, our  policies  have  been  driven  by  neoconservative  empire  radicalism,  profiteering in the military-industrial  complex, misplaced  do-good  internationalism, mercantilistic notions regarding the need to control natural resources, and blind loyalty to various  governments in the Middle East.  For all the misinformation given the  American people to justify our invasion, such as our need for national security, enforcing U.N. resolutions, removing a dictator, establishing a democracy, protecting our oil, the argument has been reduced to this: If we  leave now, Iraq will be left in a mess;  implying the implausible, that if we  stay, it won’t be a mess.  Since  it could go badly when we  leave, that blame must be placed on  those who took us there, not on those  of us who now insist that Americans no  longer need be killed or maimed, and  that Americans no longer need to kill  any more Iraqis. We have had enough  of both.  Resorting to a medical analogy: A  wrong diagnosis was made at the beginning of the war and the wrong treatment was prescribed. Refusing to reassess our mistakes and insisting on just  more and more of a failed remedy is  destined to kill the patient. In this  case, the casualties will be our  liberties and prosperity, here at home,  and peace abroad.  There is no logical reason to reject  the restraints placed in the Constitution regarding our engaging in foreign  conflicts unrelated to our national security. The advice of the founders and  our early Presidents was sound then,  and it is sound today.  We shouldn’t wait until our financial  system is completely ruined and we are  forced to change our ways. We should  do it as quickly as possible and stop  the carnage and the financial bleeding  that will bring us to our knees and  eventually force us to stop that which  we should have never started.  We all know in time the war will be  defunded one way or another and the  troops will come home. So why not  now?  ",2007

344,20,2007-02-14,Ms. PRYCE of Ohio.," I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I especially  thank you for your leadership on the  floor through this very important debate, a hard debate for us here in the  House of Representatives and a hard  debate for this country.  But, Mr. Speaker, a new plan is being  implemented, a new plan with political, economic and military components. Reinforcements are on their way  even as we speak. The Iraqis do need to  do their part, we know that. President  Maliki tells us that they will. And if  we reinforce now, they will take  it  over. They will stand up because they  must, and then we will come home.  Mr. Speaker, not everyone believes  that this is a good plan. It is sophisticated, it is comprehensive, but not everyone agrees that it is the right plan,  and I understand that.  This war certainly hasn’t achieved  its intended results. The President said  ‘‘stay the course,’’ and some said no.  The President now says, ‘‘change the  course,’’ and the same folks say no.  That’s fair; we have room in this great  Nation to disagree. But if that is the  case, that you don’t want to stay the  course or change the course, then use  the tools and the powers available to  you to stop the course.  The tools are at your disposal, the  power of the purse to defund the effort.  You  could  repeal  the  authorization  that most of us voted for this in 2002.  You could require troop withdrawal.  You have that power and you have that  right.

346,34,2007-02-14,Mr. HUNTER.," Mr. Speaker, thank  you, and I wanted to take this couple  of minutes to expand on my conversation with the majority leader.  Mr. Speaker, it has been said a number of times that we went over the  berm and went into Iraq without body  armor.  In  fact, no American troops  until just a couple of years ago, from  the time that we were first a Nation  and deployed military  forces on our  homeland or around the world, in all  those years, in that entire history of  the United States, we never had body  armor. I never had body armor in Vietnam. Nobody ever saw it. We had no  body armor in Korea. We had no body  armor in World War II, except perhaps  in very, very  specialized operations  where perhaps specialized custom-made  body armor, that is, bulletproof armor  would be manufactured for some special forces teams or special operations.  Now, I have in front of me a comparison. This comparison is between a soldier in 1999, at the end of the last administration and the equipment that  he has, and a soldier today. Now, as  you can see, this is a soldier in 1999. He  has a number of accessories. In fact, he  has an M–16; he has a flak jacket; he  has gloves; he has load-carrying equipment; he has protective goggles. He  does have a night vision device. He has  also got a helmet and accessories that  can be utilized when he is in combat.  Now,  the  soldier  today has a  lot  more. That soldier has, for example, instead of an M–16, he has an M–4 carbine. He has now body armor, including  an outer tactical vest body armor. He  has enhanced small arms protective inserts, called SAPI plates. He has deltoid  auxillary  protection  and  side  plates. He has knee pads. He has more  sophisticated aiming  equipment and  night vision equipment than his counterpart of just a couple of years ago.  My point is that whenever new systems are introduced into the force, and  the first thousand or so systems or several thousand systems go into the force  and a battalion or even a brigade has  those pieces of equipment, you can by  definition say that everybody else that  doesn’t have them is now deficient in  equipment. But, in fact, they are not  deficient in equipment. This point was  made by a leader in the 101st Airborne  who pointed out that one of his battalions that they looked at, which was  rated the top level of readiness, that is  C–1 readiness, ready to go, ready to  fight, in 1999. If you took all of the new  equipment that troops have today and  put that new equipment on as a requirement for that same battle-ready  battalion in 1999, they would be rendered C–4, or unready for battle by definition because they don’t have the new  equipment.  So I think one thing we need to do,  as we lean on the Army, the Marine  Corps, and the other services to move  equipment into the field quickly, let’s  not penalize them, and when they move  the first several thousand sets into the  field,  let’s not say, Congratulations,  you’ve just rendered on paper the rest  of your units unready because they  don’t have the new stuff you’re moving  in. That will have a chilling effect on  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:38 Feb 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K14FE7.057 H14FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007

348,41,2007-02-14,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.  Mr. Speaker, before I begin my comments, I must admit that it seems that  our friends from across the aisle have  forgotten what the subject of this debate remains. I was under the impression that we were here to debate a resolution opposing  the President’s  so-  called surge plan. Yet I keep hearing  commentary that appears to be designed to distract the American public  from the real reason that we are gathered for a conversation on our future  involvement in Iraq.  Let it be known, Mr. Speaker, that  when  it comes  time  to vote, HANK  will be voting  in  favor of  House Concurrent Resolution 63.  Now,  ‘‘help is on the way.’’ Those  were the watchwords of a former Presidential campaign 7 years ago. Yet here  we are, neck deep into the second term  of  the Bush-Cheney  administration.  And when one considers the current  state of our military’s readiness, our  proud military’s readiness, one has to  wonder, where  has  the  help  gone?  Where is the help?  b1540  If this was the help that was promised us 7 years ago, at the current state  of our readiness, I would be reluctant  to see what not helping our fine military men and women would mean.  I must point out that I, along with  each of my colleagues in this distinguished body, do support our troops.  But the issue at hand is whether, unlike campaign promises of the past, we  intend to back our rhetoric with action.  We are now engaged  in a debate  about committing more troops to what  can only be described as an  ill-conceived, poorly planned, and misguided  attempt to bring some sort of stability  to a region that has suffered terribly  JOHNSON since the President first decided to go  it alone and make his stamp upon history, for better or worse.  Although I must admit, it has even  become difficult to remember the exact  reason the President used to justify his  decision to take us to war in Iraq; but  allow me to briefly summarize for you  the  reasons  that  the President has  given the American public in his attempt to justify his decision to go to  war.  Number 1, weapons of mass destruction. There were none. Number 2, the  nuclear threat. There was none. Number 3, links to al Qaeda. There were  none. And yet now, when we debate the  wisdom of sending more than 20,000  young men and women into battle in  this so-called surge, we are expected to  trust an administration which has been  so consistently wrong. It is difficult to  remember that we are in Iraq fighting  for a war whose justification has not  yet been justified at all.  So at this point, when we look at the  state of the readiness of our military,  it has been called into question. Recruiting,  the Army  has  failed  to  achieve its recruitment goals by 17.8  percent in 2006, and moreover, recruitment quality has suffered. The percentage of Army recruits with high school  diplomas has declined. The above-average middle category test scores of our  recruits have declined, and the number  of recruits scoring in the lowest acceptable middle  category  has  increased. Our retention rates are soft.  We have got over 3,000 killed in Iraq,  20,000-plus wounded; meanwhile we are  having problems with our equipment  shortfalls, which are glaring  in  the  combat theater, and also for our nondeployed personnel who are in the process of training to be deployed to Iraq  and who cannot be properly trained  without adequate equipment.  Then we have got the issue of multiple deployments, people having been  deployed three and even four times to  the theater, but yet this President proposes  to  send  an  additional  22,000  troops, plus  support personnel,  into  this civil war in Iraq, where we are  simply sitting ducks and falling victim  to ever more sophisticated improvised  explosive devices, i.e., roadside bombs.  This killing is continuing at exorbitant rates, and so this is what we are  here to talk about with this resolution.  It is important for the American public  to know that we support our military.  We definitely want to see them do the  job that they must do. However, this  troop surge is wrong. Two wrongs do  not make a right.  ",2007
349,41,2007-02-14,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Georgia. I yield 5  minutes to my colleague on the Armed  Services Committee,  the  gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY).  ",2007
350,41,2007-02-14,Mr. COURTNEY.," Mr. Speaker, today  we are here, exactly 100 days after a  historic watershed  election  in  this  country, in which the American people  spoke  loudly and clearly  that  they  wanted a new Congress to rise to its  constitutional duty and hold this administration accountable  for  its war  policy in Iraq. The day I was sworn in  as a new Member of Congress, I accepted this responsibility, and I rise today  in opposition to the President’s escalation of the war and in support of H.  Con. Res. 63.  Make no mistake about the significance of what is happening this week.  America’s new Congress will go on  record for the first time in opposition  to  the Bush administration’s  4-year  legacy of mistakes and misjudgments  in Iraq. This will be in sharp contrast  to 8 months ago when the prior Congress did exactly the opposite. That  Congress lined up in lockstep with a  war resolution written by and for the  White House.  That resolution completely brushed  over the misleading and manipulated  intelligence that got us into this conflict, the strain of this war on our  brave men and women in uniform, and  the drain on our Nation’s military  readiness that is undercutting critical  efforts in Afghanistan and our overall  defense infrastructure. Instead of doing  their  constitutional duty,  the  109th  Congress instead just rubber-stamped  the administration’s rhetoric and failing policy.  Opponents of today’s resolution are  claiming  that  it will  damage  our  troop’s morale. As a member of the  Armed Services Committee, I believe  the opposite is true.  Let us be very clear about where the  20,000 new troops will come from. President Bush cannot simply dial 911 and  20,000 fresh new troops appear. This escalation can only happen by extending  the deployments of soldiers already in  Iraq, beyond their promised commitments, or accelerating the arrival of  preexisting rotations. Upon close examination, it is clear that the impact  of this surge  lands squarely on the  backs of our men and women in uniform who have already borne an unfair  burden.  As we debate this resolution, there  are nearly 1,900 men and women from  my State of Connecticut, including 962  from Connecticut’s National Guard,  serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. They  have all honored our Nation with their  service and sacrifice, and they have  done all that has been asked of them  and more,  and  their  families have  shown awe-inspiring strength in their  absence.  Earlier this month, I was forwarded  an e-mail from a constituent serving in  Iraq which  demonstrates  the  consequences of these unsustainable policies. In it he described how the morale  in his unit fell when they found out  that their tour was being unexpectedly  extended another 4 months. He wrote:  ‘‘These guys have seen so much of  the fighting here. To see the looks on  these soldiers’ faces was heartbreaking.  A lot of these guys had plans made already with their loved ones, like weddings, trips, or  family that traveled  from far away to see them get off that  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:38 Feb 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A14FE7.018 H14FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007

355,48,2007-02-14,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Speaker, this is  the moment that a majority of Americans who voted  last November have  been waiting for, a time when Congress  does something about Iraq. And that  something that the people asked of us  is to get us out of Iraq.  The resolution before us will not of  itself get U.S. forces out of Iraq, but to  paraphrase Winston Churchill, if it is  not the end, it is at least the beginning  of the end.  Our President is having trouble understanding  the message  from  the  American people. It is a simple message that I hear every time I go back  home to Minnesota. Time to bring our  troops home with honor. The people  are telling me our mission in Iraq is accomplished. The President already declared victory. The goals of the U.S. invasion have been met.  Iraq’s army was defeated, Saddam  Hussein  removed  from  power  and  brought to judgment. The Iraqi people  held elections to establish a new government. Mission accomplished. Time  to bring the troops home with honor.  No weapons of mass destruction were  found, despite extensive searches. The  Iraqis have a government, they have an  army, a police force. There is no further purpose of American policy to be  served by a continued military presence in Iraq.  What  remains  in  Iraq  is  religious  warfare between Sunni and Shia, with  our troops caught in the crossfire. This  is not the job our troops signed up for.  This is not the war President Bush sold  to Congress. People are  telling  the  President, it is time to bring the troops  home and to do it with honor.  President Bush has said he is concerned this resolution is prejudging the  outcome of our involvement in Iraq. I  would say the outcome is not in doubt.  We have spent and are continuing to  spend $9 billion a month in Iraq; 3,122  of our servicemen and  -women have  been  killed;  23,550-plus  have  been  wounded; tens of thousands more Iraqis  killed and wounded. The violence is escalating, our troops are the targets.  I do not think this resolution prejudges anything. The facts speak for  themselves. And the people are saying  bring the troops home with honor. I did  not support this war at its outset. We  had Saddam Hussein  contained. Al  Qaeda was not in Iraq. We had a job to  do in Afghanistan. I supported going  into Afghanistan to capture Osama bin  Laden. But I saw no clear rationale for  sending troops into combat in Iraq.  The resolution does offer a statement  of support for the troops. Their service  is an extraordinary gift. They volunteer to leave their homes and families  and risk their lives every day, at the  order of the President. All they ask is  that we never ask them to go to conflict unless that conflict is absolutely  necessary and in the national interest.  Lieutenant General William Odom,  in a recent article in The Washington  Post said, about the question that we  have to continue to fight in order to  support the troops, has anyone asked  the troops? During their  first tours,  many may have  favored staying the  course. But now in their second, third,  fourth  tours,  he writes, many  are  changing their minds.  We see no evidence of that in the  news  stories  about unhappy  troops  being sent back to Iraq. The strangest  aspect of the rationale, General Odom  writes, for continuing the war is the  implication that our troops are somehow responsible  for deciding to continue the President’s course.  That political and moral responsibility belongs to the President, not to  the troops. Didn’t Harry Truman make  it clear that the buck stops in the Oval  Office? The President keeps dodging it.  Where does it stop, General Odom asks,  with Congress? And that is why we are  here today to say it is up to us to make  a definitive statement with this resolution, a statement that it is time to end  the U.S. involvement in Iraq, to bring  the troops home with honor. And then  if the President does not heed, then we  must take more vigorous steps, steps  that I voted for in coming to end the  U.S. involvement in Vietnam over 32  years ago.  If that is what it takes, then we have  to say that the buck stops with us in  the Congress to stop the U.S. engagement in Iraq.  ANNOUNCEMENTBYTHESPEAKERPROTEMPORE  ",2007

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, as we all know, we lost  a true champion in the House of Representatives  on  yesterday: CHARLES  NORWOOD from Georgia. CHARLIE, as he  was known by most of us here, was  truly a friend across party lines and  across State lines. He was a true patriot. He served in the dental services  in the U.S. Army in the combat zone of  Vietnam.  He returned to a private dental practice in Georgia, and then in the election cycle of 1994 was elected to this  House  of Representatives. He  came  with a passion for many things. Health  care was at the very top of his list.  Education was very shortly thereafter.  And he worked on both of those issues  with all of his heart.  He  inspired many  people  in  this  House  because  he was  indeed  passionate about everything that he did. If  he was your friend, you knew he was  your friend. If you were on the opposite  side of an issue from him, he let you  know that as well, but he was still your  friend.  All of us watched as we observed  what had been diagnosed in 1998 as an  incurable disease. And following that  diagnosis, he underwent  lung  transplant surgery. That was a process that  most of us probably would have had  great difficulty undergoing. But CHARLIEdid it with courage. He rebounded  with the same kind of determination  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:07 Feb 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K14FE7.089 H14FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007

366,55,2007-02-14,Mr. WHITFIELD.," Mr. Speaker, all of  us join in wishing our condolences to  CHARLIE’s wife Gloria and his entire  family.  Those of us who were elected in 1994  and had the opportunity to know CHARLIE, to work with CHARLIE, and for me  personally I had the opportunity to sit  next to him on the Energy and Commerce Committee  for about 8 years,  CHARLIEwas many things. He was a  soldier in Vietnam, he was a businessman, he was a dentist, he was a great  United States Congressman. He also  was a Sunday school teacher at Trinity  on the Hill Methodist Church in Augusta, Georgia. And I know that that  church meant a lot to him because he  is asking for donations to that church  as a memorial.  Recently I attended a church service  in a Methodist church  in Kentucky,  and the title of the sermon was ‘‘You  Can’t Make a Success of Life Without  Making a Gift of It.’’ And when I think  that  is  really  what I think about: He made a gift of  his life. We will miss him. He has made  a tremendous impact on all of us. We  wish his family the very best.  ",2007

368,55,2007-02-14,Mr. CARTER.," I thank you for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about  my friend, CHARLIENORWOOD. I have  prepared remarks, but I would really  like to just relate like others have.  The first time I ran into CHARLIE I  was a new freshman in this body. He  sat behind me. And when you are brand  new here, you are listening and you are  trying to figure out what is going on.  And when CHARLIENORWOODopened his  mouth, he was saying things sometimes that others were not, and stood  his ground to those things, even though  they might be in conflict with both the  other side and his party, both. CHARLIE  had a way of standing up for his principles.  NORWOOD CHARLIENORWOOD I also want to talk about Gloria, because Gloria took my wife under her  wing and was kind to her. And I can  tell you for this last year and a half,  literally every week that I have served  in this Congress, my wife has asked  about CHARLIE’s health because she fell  in love with Gloria Norwood.  Everyone  in this House sends out  their hearts to Gloria at the loss of her  beloved husband. We were proud  to  serve with him. He was a great American.  Today  I rise  to honor my  friend and colleague Mr. CHARLIE from Northeastern Georgia who passed away yesterday  morning. As a man of strong character and  unwavering convictions, his passing is surely a  saddening loss to the American people.  CHARLIENORWOOD served as a brave soldier during Vietnam as part of the Army Dental  Corps in the 173rd Airborne Brigade. He was  honored for his courageous service with the  Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars.  Elected to Congress in 1994, CHARLIEwas  the  first Republican  to  represent his Northeastern Georgia district since Reconstruction.  During his time in Congress he was known for  his endless fight for the patients’ bill of rights  and his fight for stricter immigration policies.  CHARLIEbravely battled cancer and lung disease, and in his final days he returned to Augusta to be with his family. The Norwood family will be in my thoughts and prayers. Please  join me, Mr. Speaker, in expressing our deep  appreciation  for  the  lifetime of  service by  and extending our sympathies to his wife, Gloria Wilkinson Norwood,  and their family.  ",2007

370,55,2007-02-14,Mr. KING of Iowa.," I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in profound sorrow and gratitude for the life  of CHARLIENORWOOD. I believe I had  known CHARLIElong before I came here  to meet him in person. I got to know  him through C–SPAN and through the  media. When I met him personally, he  had matched up identically with the  person that I saw through the television screen. CHARLIEhad that light  within him, as John Shadegg said.  I look back at a time when CHARLIE  was not  feeling well. He came here  whenever it was physically possible for  him to do that, and I remember a day  when he  looked poor, but when he  spoke in that microphone right there,  that light came back on again and the  again blessed  this Chamber with his presence.  America will always be grateful. Gloria, Marilyn and I want you to know  that you and your family are in our  prayers. We will always look over to  this place on this floor where CHARLIE  always sat and recognize that as CHARLIE’s seat in the people’s Chamber.  ",2007

372,55,2007-02-14,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise to  express deep sorrow at the passing of  real CHARLIENORWOOD our friend and colleague, CHARLIENORWOOD. While most of us hope to make a  difference in this world, CHARLIENORWOODcertainly did that. He also made  a difference in the lives of those who  were fortunate enough to have known  him.  CHARLIEwas steadfast and did what  he thought was right. He was an immovable object in the defense of principle, and when met with irresistible  force, it wasn’t likely that CHARLIEwas  the one who was moved.  During the development of the Medicare  prescription  drug  benefit,  I  worked closely with CHARLIEand several of my colleagues to see if there  was an alternative plan and how we  were going to work this out. CHARLIE’s  contributions were  insightful,  they  were valuable, and added considerably  to the worth of our final product. During that process, he was constantly  mindful of two things, and that was the  need to help seniors who had no drug  coverage and the need to be wise stewards for taxpayers.  Coming to Congress with a medical  background, CHARLIEprovided a point  of view that enhanced any debate he  entered. While witnesses before him, at  the Health Subcommittee may have  cringed at times under his questioning,  the responses that were drawn out always added an important dimension to  our debates.  will be  sorely missed:  in  Congress, in the Health Subcommittee,  but more importantly in all our lives. I  give my deepest sympathies to his wife,  Gloria, his sons Charles and Carlton,  and his constituents.  ",2007

To Gloria, to the family, we extend  our most sincere, deepest condolences.  Kathy and I will keep you in our prayers.  I just want to tell one short story  about CHARLIE. When we came  into  Congress together back in 1994 and we  had the Contract With America, the  first 100 days, one of the very  first  votes that we had was H.R. 1. That was  an amendment to the Constitution to  balance  the budget.  I was  standing  right back here at the voting machine  beside  I  voted  ‘‘yes.’’ CHARLIE put his card  in, he  voted ‘‘yes,’’ and he turned to me and  says, You know what. That’s what I  ran on. I can go home now. I’ve done  my job. I’ve kept my promise.  That’s what CHARLIENORWOODwas  all about. I just want to say, CHARLIE,  you’re home now,  the Augusta,  the  Georgia  that  you  love,  and  our  thoughts and prayers will always be  with you and the great honor that you  have given all of us here to serve with  you in this great body.

375,62,2007-02-14,Mr. WICKER.," Madam Speaker,  I  thank my friend for yielding.  Madam Speaker, on December  31,  1776, with the fate of the Revolution in  doubt,  General  George Washington  faced a challenge of convincing his soldiers to stay in the fight. With their  enlistments over, they wanted to go  home. Washington made  an  impassioned plea and even offered volunteers  a bonus. But no one responded. He  spoke again, saying that all they held  dear was at stake. And finally one man  stepped forward. Then others followed.  Public opinion at that time was not  on Washington’s side. Only a third of  the population supported the war for  independence. One-third were openly  hostile, and another one-third simply  did not want to be involved.  We should be grateful that George  Washington was not obsessed with public opinion polls.  Only days earlier Thomas Paine had  written: ‘‘These are the times that try  men’s souls. The summer soldier and  the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis,  shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now deserves  the  love  and  thanks  of man  and  woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.’’  In the summer of 1863, Colonel Joshua Chamberlain of Maine faced a similar crisis. He had to convince a group  of mutineers to stand and fight in a  key battle. He promised to plead their  case later if they rejoined the ranks.  They did, and helped him win the Battle of Gettysburg.  Public opinion at that time was running against President Lincoln and the  war. It was lasting longer and costing  more  than anticipated.  In Congress,  Democrats demanded  the  troops be  brought home immediately, but Lincoln stood by his convictions and won  the war.  It is easy for us to look back on these  pivotal moments in our Nation’s history without remembering how tough  the going was, how reluctant many of  our own people were, and how it took  strong leadership to bring about victory.  Let’s contrast those times with the  situation today  in  Iraq. Clearly the  American people are tired and impatient with this war, and many believe  we cannot win. Yet troop morale  is  high. In testimony before Congress last  week,  the  senior  enlisted personnel  from each service, the National Guard,  and the Reserves, said our forces in  Iraq believe in what they are doing and  that positive things are being accomplished.  But you don’t have to take their  word for it. The enlistment and reenlistment figures themselves are a testimony  to  the  commitment  of  our  troops. All service branches met and  exceeded their goals in both categories  in 2006. The command sergeant major  of  the Marine Corps  told our committee that young people join the Marines today to get to the fight. Knowing full well they will go to Iraq, they  are signing up with enthusiasm and  purpose. It almost takes your breath  away to hear the troops who have been  there say they continue to believe in  our mission and want to see it through  to completion.  I hear the same thing from my constituents who have returned from Iraq.  They  express  frustration  about  the  news media’s focus on the bad news.  Returning troops tell of their successes  in helping steer Iraq toward a path of  democracy and freedom.  I received an e-mail this week from a  Mississippi soldier in Iraq. He said, ‘‘No  one wants everybody home more than I  do, but we must finish the job. We are  doing good things here and taking bad  guys out of the game.’’  The most important question in today’s debate is what message does this  resolution send to our military, to the  volunteers who have been serving so  proudly in harm’s way? And make no  mistake, they are listening to what we  say here and watching what we do here.  Will the passage of this resolution give  our  troops  encouragement?  I  don’t  think so.  The Americans are conflicted about  this war. A CBS poll this week showed  that only 44 percent of Americans support this resolution; 45 percent are opposed. That is all the more reason for  leaders to lead. Washington and Lincoln were not concerned about public  opinion polls. They did what was necessary to succeed, and that is what is  called  for  in  the halls of Congress  today.  I am convinced that deep in their  hearts, most Americans realize we are  in a serious global war  for survival  against an enemy that wants to wipe  us off the face of the Earth. When all is  said and done, the American people  want us to win this war. Success in  Iraq  is  a key  element  in winning  against the terrorists.  Osama bin Laden’s chief deputy has  urged al Qaeda operatives in Iraq to  expel the Americans, extend the ‘‘jihad  wave’’ to neighboring countries, and 2  weeks ago he spoke of Afghanistan and  Iraq as two ‘‘most crucial fields.’’ I regret to say that enemies like these will  be pleased when this resolution passes.  Madam Speaker, let’s send the terrorists a message of strength and resolve. Let’s send a message of support  and unity and confidence and appreciation  to our  troops. This  resolution  sends the wrong message, and I will  vote against it.  b1830  ",2007
376,62,2007-02-14,Mr.  FALEOMAVAEGA.,"  Madam  Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to my distinguished  friend and  colleague, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. WYNN), currently serving as  chairman of the Subcommittee on Environmental and Hazardous Materials  of  the Energy and Commerce Committee.  ",2007
377,62,2007-02-14,Mr. WYNN.," Madam Speaker, I would  like to thank the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of  House Concurrent Resolution 63, a bipartisan  resolution  supporting  our  troops  in  Iraq, while  opposing  the  President’s troop escalation strategy.  This marks the fourth year of this  war. It  is time to bring our troops  home now. We have not quelled the violence. We have not thwarted al Qaeda.  We have not stabilized the region. We  have not deterred terrorist radicals. In  fact, because of our presence, there are  more jihadists in Iraq than there were  before.  Thus, I find it inconceivable that the  President’s response to this situation, 3  years of military failure in Iraq, is to  suggest that we add more troops, 20,000  additional troops.  Since the start of the war in 2003,  over 3,000 U.S. troops have died, more  than 50 from my State of Maryland  alone. In addition, 23,000 American soldiers have suffered serious injury and  will have post-traumatic consequences.

378,69,2007-02-14,Mr. LATHAM.," I thank the gentleman  from New York for allowing me this  time.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to share  everyone’s  frustration with the mistakes that have been made in Iraq, and  the  fact that progress has not been  made as  fast as we would all have  liked. I would say, though, before you  cast your vote on this resolution, I  think it is only fair to remind Members  of this Chamber that the main thrust  of this resolution focuses only on one  of at least 10 of the recommendations  the  administration  is  carrying  out  based upon the work of the Iraq Study  Group. Others include shifting our primary mission to training and equipping Iraqi security units and embedding more U.S. soldiers in the Iraqi  military.  The administration has also pledged  to hold the Iraqi Government accountable to its commitments to take primary responsibility for security in all  of Iraq’s provinces by November, establishing a  fair constitutional amendment  process,  reforming  de-  Baathification laws, creating a fair oil  revenue sharing arrangement and holding local elections.  Let me also remind the Democratic  majority  that when  the  Iraq Study  Group announced its recommendations,  the Democratic leaders publicly stated  they hoped the President would embrace the report. But when the administration proposed carrying out policy  recommendations by the study group,  which included a surge in troops, the  Democrats backed away and took the  cynical approach, oppose and criticize,  rather than to offer to work for real solutions.  Some Members of this body will use  this week’s nonbinding resolution to  run away from the vote that they cast  in 2003. I will suggest to you that history will judge this Congress in a manner many of you have not considered.  In my judgment, every Member who  votes in favor of this resolution is endorsing the Democratic Party’s decision to manage the war from Capitol  Hill.  After all, as the debate on this resolution got under way this week, the  Democrat  leadership  in  this House  made it perfectly clear that the resolution is just the first effort by the majority to begin a Democratic-led legislative micromanagement of this war.  It is said that Colin Powell advised  the President on Iraq, if you break it,  you own it. So I want to tell the Democratic majority that with this resolution, your plan to micromanage this  war  through your  legislative  initiatives, you are taking possession of this  war.  With this resolution, you are taking  over  the day-to-day management of  this conflict, and at the same time taking the onus off of the President. Let  me say that again. You are now responsible for the outcome of this war.  The Democratic majority has determined that solutions to our most complicated  conflicts  can  be  solved  through nonbinding resolutions, and I  predict forcing the President’s hand by  cutting off the funding for our men and  women in uniform, just like they did in  Vietnam. Our soldiers fought gallantly  in Vietnam as they do today in Iraq,  but the legislative micromanagement  by the U.S. Congress during the Vietnam era, and in decisions to cut funding for our military mission in Southeast Asia, only tied the hands of our  warriors, but it not only tied the hands  of our warriors, it demoralized our men  and women in uniform for decades.  Ladies and gentlemen, the new majority has not learned from the mistakes of the past, but has arrogantly  concluded that House Democrats can  take  command  and  control  of  our  strategy and our troops in Iraq from  the  floor of  this Chamber. Keep  in  mind, now that the Democratic leadership has assumed  the  role of Commanders in Chief, the consequences of  failures are now also theirs. Just as the  North Vietnamese changed their strategy and were emboldened by the misguided actions of the Congress, so too  will the enemies of freedom in Iraq be  emboldened by this and subsequent resolutions by this Congress.  Furthermore, if the majority party’s  political  rhetoric  corresponds  with  their legislative agenda on Iraq, you  can rest assured that the humanitarian  disaster will be yours. The jihadist victory will be yours. The rogue state coalition of Iran and Syria will be yours.  b1930  A genocidal Sunni-Shiite-Arab civil  war will be yours. You will have handed al Qaeda victory and empowered its  homicidal leaders. Again with this resolution, the Democratic majority has  seized control of  this conflict. And  again,  remember what Colin Powell  said: If you break it you own it.  History will not focus on your voting  for  the  resolution  authorizing  the  force, but they will long remember you  unleashing the hell that is going to  come in Iraq by voting for this resolution.

Madam Speaker, I would say in response to the gentleman’s comments,  we gladly accept  the  responsibility.  That responsibility was truly exhibited  in the election in November. This is  the reason why we are taking action. I  think this resolution, every bit, is part  of that accepting the responsibility and  the will of the American people who  have spoken in the November election.  I just want to note that.

382,76,2007-02-14,Mr. TOWNS.," Let me say to you that  I read the resolution, and I don’t know  how you can arrive at that conclusion.  Mr. KING of New York. Reclaiming  my time, the reason I am saying that  is, you are opposing the 21,000 troop increase, and that is the policy of General Petraeus, who  is the new commander in the field. That is the policy  he is asking his troops to carry out,  and you are opposing the very policy  gentleman  the  the new commander says can work and  will work.  With that, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman  from South Carolina  (Mr.  BROWN).  Mr. BROWN of South Carolina.  I  thank the gentleman from New York  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, as President Bush and  his top military advisers  implement  the new plan for victory in Iraq, we  must be united in a common goal for  victory, and we should never  forget  that our enemy is listening to this debate, just as our troops are listening to  every word of every Member of this  Congress.  As many of my colleagues have done,  I have personally visited Iraq. I have  seen the progress and I have seen the  good  job  that  our  brave men  and  women are doing for us and for the people of Iraq.  We have achieved some major accomplishments  in  Iraq. Women are now  able to vote in real elections for the  first time in their lives. Iraqi citizens  are now able to protest and let their  opinions be heard in public, and Iraq is  a self-governing nation,  free of tyranny.  I was proud to sit down and share a  meal with many soldiers from South  Carolina’s First District. And the question many of our soldiers kept asking  me was, why are none of the good stories making it back to the folks at  home?  Mr. Speaker, I think that many of us  today are trying to share some of the  good stories and recognize some of the  positive things that our brave men and  women in Iraq are doing for us.  South Carolina’s First District has a  high proportion of active and retired  military personnel and are directly impacted by the war in the Middle East.  At the Charleston Air Force Base, the  C–17 aircraft that come and go are a direct link in the supply chain that assist our brave soldiers fighting for us in  Iraq.  At  Force  Protection  in  Ladson,  South Carolina, they continue to build  the Buffalo and the Cougar vehicles  that  save  the  lives of our  soldiers  against  the mines and  IED attacks  every day.  Last year on Memorial Day, in my  capacity as chairman of the Veterans  Affairs Subcommittee on Health, I was  fortunate  enough  to  be  the  guest  speaker at an American cemetery in  Normandy, France, which  overlooks  Omaha Beach.  Our brave soldiers during World War  II were  in France not to  fight the  French, but  to  fight  the occupying  Nazis. Today our soldiers are not in  Iraq and Afghanistan to fight the citizens of those countries, but are there  to fight the insurgents in Iraq and the  Taliban in Afghanistan.  In listening to the debate over the  past few days, it reminded me of my  visit and reading some of the names of  the brave soldiers that fought our Nation’s war during World War II.  Mr. Speaker, there are over 9,300 buried  in Normandy. Those brave souls  fought in a war against the forces of  evil then, just as our soldiers in Iraq  are fighting against the forces of evil  today.  What would have happened if Franklin Delano Roosevelt pulled our troops  out of France after the casualties we  took  storming  the beaches of Normandy? If Franklin Delano Roosevelt  was alive today, what would he think  of this debate which empowers and energizes our enemies and demoralizes  our brave  fighting men and women?  What would America have done if the  Congress enacted a nonbinding resolution to pull our troops out of France  after D–Day? What kind of world would  we be living in today?  Iraq is directly tied to the future security of our Nation, and consequently,  failure in Iraq is not an option.  I do not believe we have already lost  in Iraq, but we will lose if we don’t give  the troops what they need to win. I remain hopeful that the Democrats and  Republicans can unite around a new  policy,  clearly  defining  our  troops’  mission for the sake of our national security.  Mr. Speaker,  I  support President  Bush and his vision for the new strategy for victory in Iraq. I cannot in  good faith support this resolution because it sends our soldiers the message  that the United States Congress believes  that  they  cannot  succeed  in  their mission. It is much easier to complain, while offering no real ideas or alternatives. This resolution is all bark  and no bite.  I will conclude with a quote from a  good friend and someone I am proud to  have  as my  constituent, Medal  of  Honor recipient and retired Major General James Livingston. ‘‘Today we have  a choice of fighting the enemy in Iraq.  If we do not take them on in Iraq, then  we will be forced to fight the enemy  here on our homeland.’’  Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this  resolution.  b2040  ",2007

385,90,2007-02-14,Mr. TANCREDO.," Mr. Speaker, the  approaching vote on this resolution has  caused me and I am sure many of my  colleagues to give serious and considerable thought to the most difficult issue  that faces America today.  Like many of my  friends on both  sides of the aisle, and like many Americans I am opposed to increasing our  troop presence in Iraq. I am sure we  have all asked ourselves individually  what we would do if we were in the  oval office at this time.  If I were in the oval office, if I were  Commander in Chief, I would tell the  Iraqis something similar to what Benjamin Franklin  told a woman who  asked him as he came out of the negotiations on the Continental Congress,  Dr. Franklin, what have you given us?  He answered, a Republic  if you can  keep it.  Mr. Speaker, I believe we have with  our blood and treasure already won a  great victory when we deposed a dictator and helped the Iraqis set up a  fledgling democracy. Frankly, I believe  it is up to them to keep it.  Mr. Speaker, the fall of Saddam has  helped create a situation in the Middle  East that we did not anticipate but one  that can be exploited. I believe that the  ethnic and sectarian earthquake inside  and across the broader Middle East is  underway. I believe the fault lines in  this conflict can be seen moving today,  not just in Iraq, but in Lebanon, Iran  and elsewhere.  If  I were Commander  in Chief,  I  would do what I could to exploit the  situation. I believe it can be exploited,  but not if we are acting as a referee in  what has become a civil war. I believe  that prolonging or increasing the U.S.  presence  in Iraq will virtually guarantee this fault line will move in a way  not advantageous to us.  Sure, if I was President, Mr. Speaker,  I can tell you unequivocally I would  not be sending an extra 20,000 soldiers.  But I am not President of the United  States, I am not Commander in Chief,  I am a Member of Congress. And while  I have every right as a Member of Congress to voice my concerns and objections to what I see as  flaws  in the  strategies this President may choose to  employ, neither I nor this Congress has  the right to micromanage a war.  Mr. Speaker, our Constitution vests  sole authority of the U.S. military in  the President of the United States, not  in 435 Congressmen or 100 Senators.  Our Founding Fathers empowered the  President, not the Congress, with the  authority precisely to avoid the kind of  group micromanagement of our military strategy that we are seeing on  this floor today.  I differ with the President on many  things, Mr. Speaker.  Indeed one of  them is the recently announced surge  strategy. But while  I am concerned  about the wisdom of the strategic military decision, Congress does not have  the authority nor the ability to manage this war or any other by committee.  I fear that this resolution is just the  beginning of a long-term attempt by  Congress to become the micromanager  of the conflict in Iraq. As many Members have correctly noted, this resolution is nonbinding, but it has been described by its authors as just the bark  from the Congressional dog. The bite  will come as they say during the appropriations process.  As  I  said  at  the  beginning, Mr.  Speaker,  for a  time  this  resolution  posed a dilemma  for me. But after  hours of listening to the debate, reading the Constitution, it helped me to  decide how to vote, there is no longer a  doubt in my mind. I accept the wisdom  of the Founding Fathers and bend to  the constraints of the document that  we swear to uphold and defend.  I hope that Members of both sides  will think carefully about the precedent that this debate will set for the  future,  for  future Presidents,  future  wars, future soldiers. I would ask them  to  join me  in opposing this  ill-conceived resolution.  ",2007

387,90,2007-02-14,Mr. COSTA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise this  evening to welcome this much needed  debate, on perhaps one of the greatest  challenges facing our generation, our  country, this war in Iraq. I intend to  support this nonbinding resolution not  because I believe it is perfect, rather in  fact I feel it is probably imperfect.  But I am supporting it because I hope  this will be the beginning of a rational,  bipartisan dialogue for a new direction  to  be  employed  together with  the  House  of Representatives, with  the  Congress working together with the  President.  For after all, Mr. Speaker, we are the  people’s House. The choices that we  have before us today are more than  simply cut and run or stay the course.  For after all, we know a long time ago  that was nothing more than a sound  bite, and the American public understood that it was nothing more than a  political sound bite. We are a wonderful country. We have tremendous resources, ingenuity, and we have credibility notwithstanding our difficulties  today throughout the world.  And therefore, as the world’s greatest  super power, we have resources and  means  in which we can offer alternative choices to bring together people,  not only in the Middle East, but allies  throughout the world that supported us  in the past.  Everyone who has talked about this  nonbinding resolution talks about the  cost. We all talk about their support  for our men and women in uniform, our  support to continue to ensure that they  are properly funded and to ensure that  we always, always remember the current costs that have been expended,  over 3,000 lives, over 23,000 that have  been  injured, and a  fiscal accountability  that has gotten  lost  in  the  checks and balances of the Congress, a  war that  initially was advertised to  cost us $60 billion is now in excess of  $379 billion, $8 billion a month, with a  supplemental request for another $235  billion.  Mr. Speaker, we do not need nor  should we micromanage the war. But  we should, as an equal branch of Government, require and demand accountability. That is why I stood up on this  floor 2 weeks ago supporting the Blue  Dog Accountability Act to ensure that  we have an opportunity to review on a  regular basis the conduct of the war,  the  no-bid  contracts,  the  single  sourcing, putting our troops in harm’s  way without adequate armament.  Let us not forget, for almost 4 years  our President and the course that he  conducted and the case he has made  has had a blank check,  literally a  blank check to conduct this effort as  he saw fit.  b2245  And it has only been in the last 6  months when  it became abundantly  clear in the last year that it was determined that a new course or a new direction would be needed. But, unfortunately, so much of this new course that  the President offered  last month  is  more of the same and, unfortunately,  too little too late.  I told the President that I was doubtful on this surge. Why? Because we  have had previous surges, back in August of last year a surge in Baghdad  with six brigades that was promised by  the Iraqi Army. They delivered two.  They weren’t very good. We neutralized  Sadr City. Maliki got political pressure  placed on him. We were asked to leave.  Unless we have a robust political effort  that accompanies  this  surge,  I  fear, unfortunately, more of the same  will occur, which is why I asked the  Secretary of State last week what is  plan B?  We are, whether we like it or not, in  the middle of a sectarian civil war. And  unfortunately, the folks that we are  trying to referee are more concerned  about how power is distributed and how  oil revenues are distributed as opposed  to instituting a democracy in the Middle East. And therefore, we need a new  direction.  Have we not learned the lessons that  many of us remember from the Vietnam War? Secretary Powell knew those  lessons well. Remember what Secretary Powell advised our President?  He says, Iraq, Mr. President, is like a  Pottery Barn. We break it, we own it.  Unfortunately, how true those words  have come.  But Secretary Powell knew from his  experience as a general that the Powell  doctrine invoked four principles, one,  to have overwhelming support of the  Nation; two, in fact, to ensure that we  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:21 Feb 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00090 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K14FE7.177 H14FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007
388,97,2007-02-14,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentlewoman very much for  the time and for her charity and her  leadership on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this  evening with a whirlwind of senses and  emotions. I am disappointed. I am disappointed by the emptiness and the hypocrisy of this resolution.  Our men and women in the field, valiantly serving to protect our freedom,  they deserve more than this. They deserve a real debate that honors the job  that they are doing.  Instead, what we have this week is a  resolution that  is eight short  lines,  eight lines, that in their entirety stab  at the motives and undermine the difficult work that our patriot military is  doing. I am so disappointed in a majority party that has no more respect for  our military than that.  This debate has been called historic,  and historic it is. It is historic in its  hypocrisy.  If you truly believe that  this is not winnable with what has been  proposed, then it is incumbent upon  you to do everything that you can do  to stop it and stop it now. Doing anything less belies your duty and your responsibility.  This resolution says we support you  but we are going to hang you out to  dry, and this from the folks who say  they want a new direction. What a disgrace to the  integrity of this body.  How disappointing.  I am saddened. I am saddened by the  apparent fact that everything done by  the majority is absolutely political, all  form, no substance. Is there nothing  above politics? Surely the defense of  our Nation and  the preservation of  freedom should be above politics.  How did a once proud party,  the  party of FDR, who  said,  ‘‘We have  nothing to fear but fear itself,’’ and the  party of JFK, who said, ‘‘Let every Nation know, whether it wishes us well or  ill, that we shall pay any price, bear  any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty,’’ how did a once proud party drop  to such a depth? How very sad.  I am astounded by the seeming lack  of desire to study and to call upon historical events for a basis upon which to  develop policy. America is a great and  a good Nation, and we are great and  good because we have been blessed to  have been led by men and women who  until now did their level best to utilize  all the information available.  I urge my colleagues to be true to the  oath that we took just a few weeks ago.  Don’t you remember, we stood right  here and said,  ‘‘I do solemnly swear  that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against  all enemies, foreign and domestic?’’ All  enemies, foreign and domestic.  What is a glimpse of the recent history of our current enemy?  1983, a  truck bomb kills 241 Marines in their  barracks in Beirut; 1993, six killed in  the first World Trade Center bombing;  2000, al Qaeda’s attack on the destroyer  USS Cole, killing 17 American sailors;  and then September 11, 2001, al Qaeda’s  hijackers  fly planes  into  the World  Trade Center and the Pentagon, while  passengers on a fourth plane bring it to  a crash landing in Pennsylvania, total  number killed, 2,973.  Since then, there have been attacks  in England and Spain and elsewhere,  and just last summer, Scotland Yard in  Britain arrested a couple who planned  to destroy 10 civilian planes over the  Atlantic. They were going to use their  8-month-old baby to disguise the bomb  material as baby food. We as a Nation  are ill-prepared for the ferocity and the  hatred of people who will kill their own  baby in order to get a chance to kill us.  American  public  policy  failed  to  grasp the scope of the threat posed by  radical Islam until September 11, 2001.  On September 11, we reaped the consequences  of  decades  of  inaction  against the very real threat posed by  militant Islam.  These  are  extremely  challenging  times. Some would credibly  suggest  that  these are more difficult  times  than we have faced since World War II,  with the demographics of our society,  the changing nature of the world and  globalization and the nature of our  competitors, all overshadowed by the  nature of our avowed enemy, those who  have publicly stated their goal to see  the  end of  the Western world and  America and who are working to secure  the means to accomplish that goal.  I am perplexed. I am perplexed by the  apparent inability of many in Congress  to grasp this fundamental fact. We are  currently facing an enemy who is calculating, patient,  indiscriminate and  murderous, an enemy actively waging  war against us.  That is not just an opinion. That is  not just my opinion. That is their stated purpose and fact.  In their own words, Osama bin Laden  said,  ‘‘Hostility toward America is a  religious duty, and we hope to be rewarded for it by God . . . I am confident that Muslims will be able to end  the legend of the so-called superpower  that is America.’’  Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman  said,  ‘‘Oh, you Muslims everywhere, sever  the ties of their Nation, tear them  apart, ruin their economy,  instigate  against  their  corporations,  destroy  their embassies, attack their interests,  sink their ships, and shoot down their  airplanes. Kill them in land, at sea, and  in the air, kill them wherever you find  them.’’  So the impact of this resolution, Mr.  Speaker, is to give aid and comfort to  the enemy and to dishearten our own  military.  In a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on January 23, General  David Petraeus, now commanding officer in Iraq, agreed that a resolution of  disapproval for this new strategy would  ‘‘give the enemy encouragement.’’  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:54 Feb 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00097 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K14FE7.187 H14FEPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007

392,104,2007-02-14,Mr. REID.," Madam President, I would  like to say that this 110th Congress,  when we came here, Democrats and Republicans alike had a real problem because the last Congress only funded the  Government until February 15. With  cooperation  between Democrats  and  Republicans,  difficult  negotiations  took place, but  it was a  situation  where Senators COCHRAN and BYRD,  who lead us in the Appropriations Committee, working with Chairman OBEY  on the other side of the Capitol, together with all ranking members and  all chairs of  the  subcommittees on  both sides, worked through these difficult issues. And they were difficult.  We had not enough money to do all  that is necessary to be done, but we got  it done without a single earmark. I  know this was difficult.  There are issues that are so troubling. There is a Senator on the other  side of the aisle, JOHNNYISAKSON from  Georgia. I don’t know how you could  find a nicer person in the world than  JOHNNYISAKSON. He is pleasant. He always has a smile on his face. He has an  issue that is really important to him  concerning children and health—something that should be in this bill. It is  not.  KAY BAILEYHUTCHISON, the senior  Senator from Texas, has an issue dealing with BRAC that has bipartisan support. There are bases that we legislated  closure for, and communities are having difficult times as a result of these  base closures doing all that needs to be  done, and we promised them money to  allow  these  closures  to go  forward  without as much  concern and  real  hardship. But there wasn’t anything we  could do. If we had a single amendment  on this bill, it had to go back for conference.  As a result of that, it would mean  that very likely we couldn’t complete  this by tomorrow night at midnight. I  have made commitments to a number  of people that we are going to take  care of  these  things  in  the  supplemental which should be here the last  week in March, and I am going to do  E T A N E S h t i w 0 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

394,111,2007-02-14,Mr. BROWN.," Mr. President, today before the Senate Banking Committee,  the Federal Reserve Chairman testified  that the economy is doing well. I was  joined by my friend, the Senator from  New Jersey, Mr. MENENDEZ, who is in  the chair. He told us that consumer  spending is up, productivity is up, and  that  the  labor market  will  stay  healthy. At the very moment that the  Chairman delivered a rosy prediction  for our Nation’s economy, an AP story  broke that Chrysler is cutting 13,000  jobs. One hundred of those jobs are in  Cleveland. Those aren’t just numbers;  those are 100 families.  Two weeks ago, before the same Senate Banking Committee, the Treasury  Secretary testified that the economy  was  doing well. He  repeated many  times that the GDP had grown in excess of 3 percent. Earlier that same  morning, at  the Senate Agriculture  Committee, Rhonda Stewart, a single  mother from Hamilton, OH, testified  that despite working full time, caring  for her 9-year-old son Wyatt, and even  serving as president of the PTA and a  leader in the Boy Scouts, she and her  son must rely on food stamps to survive. At the end of each month, she  told us, she must forgo dinner so her  son can eat because the food stamps  just don’t go far enough.  Worker productivity is up, profits are  up, the stock market is doing well, and  millionaires are  enjoying  exorbitant  tax breaks. Thirteen thousand more  workers are about to lose their jobs,  and a single mother working full time,  involved in her community, doing her  best, can’t afford to eat dinner. There  is a clear disconnect between the corporate-driven myopia of this administration on our Nation’s economy and  the  real-world  economic  conditions  working  families  in  Ohio  struggle  through every day.  Our middle class is shrinking in large  part because our policies  in Washington have betrayed  the values of  working families across our country,  which is why we must revamp our economic and trade policies so that we invest  in our middle class. We must  shrink  income  inequality, grow our  business community, and create good-  paying jobs. We must establish trade  policy that builds our economic security. That is not what we have now.  Job  loss does not  just affect  the  worker or even just the worker’s family; job loss, especially job loss in the  thousands, devastates communities. It  hurts the  local business owners—the  drugstore, the grocery store, the neighborhood restaurant. When people are  out of work, they can’t support their  local economy, which forces owners to  close, in too many cases, their small  businesses. That means lost revenues  to  the  community,  which  hurts  schools, which hurts fire departments,  which hurts police departments. The  trade policies we set in Washington and  negotiated across the globe have a direct impact on places such as Toledo  and Steubenville, Cleveland and Lima,  Zanesville and Portsmouth.  We hear  the word  ‘‘protectionist’’  thrown around by those who insist on  more of the same failed trade policies.  It  is  considered  ‘‘protectionist’’  by  some of them to fight for labor and environmental standards, but they call it  free trade when we pass trade agreements to protect drug company patents  and Hollywood DVDs. If we can protect  intellectual property, as we should, if  we can protect  intellectual property  rights with enforceable provisions in  trade agreements, we can certainly do  the same for labor and environmental  and food safety standards. It is not a  question of if we trade, it is how we  trade and who benefits from that trade.  While it is unclear whether the administration will  ever  acknowledge  that our trade policy has failed, it is  very clear that this Congress is already  at work. Republicans and Democrats  are working cooperatively to revamp  our trade policy. We are working cooperatively to raise the minimum wage.  We will work cooperatively to make  education more affordable for middle-  class families and to lower the cost of  prescription drugs for our Nation’s seniors, and we will work cooperatively to  invest in new technology and new industry.  In my State of Ohio, we have a talented and hard-working labor force and  an  entrepreneurial  spirit  second  to  none that needs only the investment  dollars,  predictable  tax  policy,  and  commitment from our Government to  realize our economic potential.  Oberlin College,  in  the county  in  which I live, Lorain County, has the  largest building on any university campus in the country fully powered by  solar energy. However, the builder had  to buy the solar panels from Germany  and Japan because we do not make  enough of them in our country.  Through investment and alternative  energy, we can not only create jobs, we  can grow industry, and we can grow industry  through  biomedical  research  and development. Now is the time for  Government to do its part and direct  our  priorities  from  favoring  the  wealthiest 1 percent to growing our Nation’s middle class.  Mr. President, on a personal note, I  would like to take this opportunity to  wish my wife Connie, who is home in  Ohio under  several  feet of  snow, a  happy Valentines Day.  Connie, I am blessed to have you as  my wife.

395,125,2007-02-14,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Madam President,  this  joint  funding  resolution  is not  what anyone wanted. We are in this position because the last Congress failed  to do its job. We had no choice. We  were determined to stay within strict  spending limits while trying to address  compelling needs.  I believe we have  done the best we can do. We were able  to take care of the most important priorities facing the nation without going  over our spending limits.  In the Commerce, Justice, Science  chapter of this resolution, we were able  to increase funding for the Department  of Justice by $1.4 billion over last year  to ensure there were no cuts to the FBI  and the war against terror. We provided the FBI with a $333 million increase over the old CR which  fully  funds the FBI, U.S. attorneys and the  Bureau of Prisons. More importantly,  the additional $1.4 billion eliminates  the cuts to State and local law enforcement proposed in the President’s budget. At a time when crime rates are  going back up according to the most  recent FBI crime statistics, we fully  fund the COPS program, as well as programs to fight gangs and sexual predators. Protecting our neighborhoods and  communities remains our No. 1 priority and this extra funding is proof of  our  commitment  to make America  safer.  We were also able to make a down  payment on our innovation and competitiveness agenda. We added $335 million to the National Science Foundation’s research account to increase our  commitment  to basic  research  that  will  lead  to new  breakthroughs  in  science, technology and future innovation to keep America competitive in  the global economy. In addition, we  added $38 million to the National Institute of Standards and Technology to  increase research grants and an additional $12 million to modernize their  laboratory facilities. Finally, we gave  the Patent and Trademark Office the  full $1.7 billion called for in the President’s fiscal year 2007 budget request  and ensured that all patent fees stay  with the Patent Office.  While I would have liked to have increased funding for NASA, there was  simply not enough extra funding available for us to do so. Within the limits  of NASA’s fiscal year 2006 operating  plan, we added an extra $460 million to  exploration while protecting other critical NASA programs in science and aeronautics. With only 7 months left in  this fiscal year, I believe NASA will be  able to manage their programs in exploration with minimal impact to the  overall schedule.  This bill cuts $3.3 billion in Military  Constructions funds required to implement the 2005 Base Realignment and  Closure round. By putting the entire  year’s BRAC Military  Construction  program on hold, the current situation  has caused adverse disruptions to important military planning. In Maryland  alone, the Defense Department is unable to execute over $300 million worth  of projects, preventing the construction of badly needed facilities that directly support our warfighters. This  delay also has a huge impact on the  economy of the State of Maryland, in  the construction  industry and other  key  support  industries. Finally,  the  continuing resolution blocks critical  projects required to implement the 2005  Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC,  recommendations,  jeopardizing  the  ability of our military installations to  required BRAC actions on  complete  time.  I, along with the other members of  the Maryland congressional delegation,  have sent a letter to the Chairmen and  ranking members of  the House and  Senate Appropriations Committee, urging them to fully fund BRAC Military  Construction  in the  fiscal year 2007  emergency supplemental spending bill.  Both the House and Senate majority  leaders have pledged their support for  our effort. I will fight to add this vital  funding  to  the  emergency  supplemental when it comes before the Senate in March.  So while this bill is not what anyone  wanted, it is the best we could do considering what we were left with. I will  support this continuing resolution and  I will fight to do better next year.

396,125,2007-02-14,Mr. NELSON  of Florida.," Madam  President, I rise today to clarify an  issue of concern to communities in my  home state of Florida, particularly to  those who have been affected by natural disasters in recent years.  The continuing resolution, H.J. Res.  20, contains a revision to the formula  for funding the critical section 8 tenant-based  rental  assistance  voucher  program. Inefficiencies in the voucher  funding  formula  in place  since  2004  have resulted in the loss of vouchers  for an estimated 150,000  families nationwide. My understanding is that the  revised formula will provide sufficient  funding for the number of families assisted last year, and provides a $100  million pool to assist agencies who experience unusual circumstances during  the transition.  However, due to the devastating hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, several of our  Florida communities helped unusually  low numbers of families last year. This  is because the hurricanes devastated  their housing stock they simply did  not have the apartments and houses to  rent.  In some areas, the amount of  need did not decline; there was simply  a shortage of affordable housing options.  I rise to confirm my understanding  that the section 8 funds for housing assistance payments already allocated by  the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, HUD, to a local housing  authority will remain accessible.  If my understanding is correct, housing authorities may continue to use  the  funds  in their possession, along  with their  fiscal year 2007  funds, to  lease up to the authorized level of units  under contract. This will ensure that  our hurricane damaged communities  and others who have seen losses in recent  years  due  to  unforeseen  circumstances or  the dislocations  that  have occurred since 2004 will be able to  recover. As our communities rebuild, I  want to make sure that our housing  agencies will continue to have access  to the available resources needed to  serve low-income families.  ",2007

398,132,2007-02-14,Mr. KYL.," Madam President, 95 years  ago  today Arizona became  the  48th  State in the Union when, on February  14, 1912, President William Taft signed  the Arizona Statehood Act.  Today, just as almost a century ago,  Americans are drawn to Arizona’s economic opportunity, culture, and natural beauty. At the time of statehood,  Arizona’s population numbered in the  hundreds  of  thousands,  but  it was  growing quickly, from around 200,000 in  1910 to over 330,000 in 1920. Today, it is  the Nation’s  fastest growing State,  with a population of more than 6 million.  Tourists flock to the State for its  cultural heritage and scenic beauty.  Arizona is home to four national parks  and many other national monuments  and historic  sites. Many who visit  these sites are heeding the advice of  Theodore Roosevelt, who said of the  Grand Canyon,  ‘‘You cannot improve  on it. But what you can do is to keep  it  for your children, your children’s  children, and all who come after you,  as the one great sight which every  American should see.’’  From its days as a rough Wild West  territory to the dynamic State it is  today, Arizona’s beauty and culture  has captivated those who have experienced  it.  I wish the State a happy  birthday.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  KANSAS AIR NATIONAL GUARD  ∑",2007
399,132,2007-02-14,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Madam President,  I wish to acknowledge the accomplishments  of  the Kansas Air National  Guard, specifically the 190th Air Refueling Wing which celebrates its 50th  anniversary on February 23, 2007. The  enormous sacrifice and dedication of  these heroic men and women reflects  well on themselves, the 190th Air Refueling Wing, and the Kansas Air National Guard. They truly make all Kansans proud.  This outstanding military organization began as the 117th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron located at the Hutchinson Naval Air Station in Hutchinson,  KS. The unit was federally recognized  on February 23, 1957. Over the course of  its 50-year history, the 190th has flown  the F–80, B–57A, B–57G, RB–57, EB–57,  KC–135A, KC–135D, KC–135E and currently the KC–135R. The unit was stationed at Hutchinson Naval Air Station—later  the Hutchinson Air National Guard Base—until 1967 when the  unit was  transferred  to Forbes Air  Force Base in Topeka, KS.  The  190th Air Refueling Wing at  Forbes Field continues to be a leader in  the Air National Guard. The unit recently  received  two  prestigious  awards—the Spaatz  trophy—awarded  to the overall outstanding Air National  Guard Flying Wing—and the Air Force  Outstanding Unit Award. We owe these  brave servicemen, servicewomen, and  their  families a debt of gratitude. I  thank them for their 50 years of service  and extend my best wishes to them for  the next 50 years and beyond.∑  f  MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE  ENROLLED BILL SIGNED  At 12:03 p.m., a message  from the  House of Representatives, delivered by  Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks,  announced that the Speaker has signed  the following enrolled bill:  H.R. 742.

400,146,2007-02-14,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased today to join my friend and  colleague,  the  senior Senator  from  Georgia, as a cosponsor of legislation  to provide some needed improvements  to the Food Stamp Program’s eligibility rules.  Senator CHAMBLISS’ legislation, the  Food Stamp Personal Savings and Investment Act of 2007, would exempt retirement accounts and educational savings accounts from the current asset  limits test  in the Food Stamp Program. Additionally,  this  bill would  index the current asset limit to inflation.  For most households,  the  current  asset limit in the Food Stamp Program  is $2000; $3000 for households with an elderly individual or an individual with a  disability. This  limit has not been  raised in over 20 years, making it inconsistent with  the  economic  challenges  faced by  today’s  low-income  working families in America.  In addition, current Food Stamp Program resources rules are inconsistent.  Many types of retirement accounts and  all educational savings accounts are  counted against the asset limit, meaning that a working mother who has recently become unemployed but managed to save $2500 for her daughter’s  college education is actually ineligible  for food stamps. This forces otherwise  eligible households to have to choose  between  liquidating  such  savings,  which in many cases are also subject to  a financial penalty, or going without  needed food assistance.  It is clear that current Food Stamp  Program rules actually discourage people from planning responsibly for their  futures and deny them a helping hand  at a time when they need it most. It  makes no sense for the government to  force  families  that  are  suffering  through periods of unemployment to  spend down  the  savings which  represent their only source of security in  times of hardship. In essence we require people to trade-off their minimal  savings for meager food stamp benefits  that equal an average of one dollar per  meal per person.  If our true goal is to provide low-income families with a hand up—to help  make a better life for themselves and  their  children—then we must  enact  policies that actually encourage them  to build the resources that are necessary to get out of poverty and remove the barriers to saving that exist  in current law. Exempting retirement  and educational savings accounts from  the Food Stamp Program’s asset limits  test will help do that.  Similarly,  adjusting  the  current  asset limit so that it rises with inflation will provide a more reasonable,  less-restrictive threshold that, though  modest, will at least prevent further  erosion in the current asset limits. I’m  hopeful that we can do more than just  indexing the current limit, which is too  restrictive. I hope that we can first increase the asset limits and then index  them annually to inflation. But Senator CHAMBLISS’ bill is a good start,  and I commend him for seeking to address this problem.  Taken together, these are common  sense changes that are needed throughout our federal anti-poverty programs  to allow  low-income Americans who  are currently discouraged from saving  to invest in their futures. The Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and  Forestry obviously has no jurisdiction  over other anti-poverty programs, but  we can start by removing the unrealistic and damaging  limits that currently exist within the Food Stamp  Program.  I should also make clear that this is  not the only change needed to improve  upon the Food Stamp Program. We  clearly must do more to help those who  suffer  from  food  insecurity  in  this  country, and there are a number of  other  improvements  that we  should  make to our  federal  food assistance  programs to help low-income families  put food on their tables.  This legislation is a good start to the  larger  objective  of  simplifying  and  strengthening our food assistance programs to make them more responsive  and relevant to helping meet the needs  of today’s low-income American families. I commend Senator CHAMBLISSfor  introducing this bill, am happy to cosponsor  it and  look  forward to continuing to work with him to promote  economic and food security and stability  for  low-income Americans and  families.  By Ms. COLLINS:  S. 592. A bill to amend the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for a  manufacturer’s  jobs  credit,  and  for  other purposes; to the Committee on  Finance.  ",2007
401,146,2007-02-14,Ms. COLLINS.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  introduce  legislation,  the  ‘‘Growing Our Manufacturing Employment Act, or ‘‘GoME,’’ which is aimed  at  reinvigorating  the manufacturing  sector, boosting the level of domestic  manufacturing, and preventing the further loss of manufacturing jobs.  Few issues are as important to the  American people than the availability  of good  jobs  in  their  communities.  Manufacturing jobs have long provided  quality employment for generations of  Americans. But in recent years, employment in the manufacturing sector  has dropped, and over 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost since the  year 2000.  Few States have been hit harder by  the loss of manufacturing jobs than my  home State of Maine. According to the  National Association of Manufacturers,  Maine has  lost 22,000 manufacturing  jobs—nearly 28 percent of our total—  since  the beginning of  this decade.  These jobs once provided lifelong employment  to Mainers  in  towns  like  Millinocket, Wilton, Waterville, Fort  Kent, Dexter, Westbrook, and Sanford.  Here is but one example of the tragic  results of this ongoing trend, from my  home State of Maine: For 60 years,  Moosehead Manufacturing  produced  furniture of the highest quality—beautiful  designs  and  quality materials  combined with expert craftsmanship.  Last week, Moosehead closed its doors.  More than 120 skilled workers have lost  their jobs. A traditional Maine business, built from the ground up by a  Maine family, is gone.  Why  are American manufacturing  jobs disappearing? Three years ago, the  National Association of Manufacturers  released a study showing that American manufacturers  face  ‘‘structural  costs’’ that makes it 22 percent more  expensive to manufacture goods here  than overseas. Last fall, NAM updated  this study, and found that these costs  are escalating, with American manufacturers now facing a cost differential  31 percent higher than our nine leading  trading partners.  While it would surprise no one that  U.S. manufacturers face a higher cost-  of-doing business than manufacturers  in countries like China and Mexico, it  would be a mistake to assume that  wage  rates  alone  explain  this  difference. They do not. In fact, the productivity  of  American  workers  is  unrivaled, allowing American workers  to receive more value, in wages, for the  goods they produce. As the original  NAM study states, if wages were the  only factor, then ‘‘U.S. manufacturers  would be much more dominant . . . in  the global markets than the current  trade situation suggests.’’  It is other  ‘‘structural costs’’ that  make it more expensive to manufacture goods in the U.S. relative to the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:34 Feb 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G14FE6.043 S14FEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 0 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007
402,153,2007-02-14,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  today,  Senator SMITH and I are introducing  the School-Based Health Clinic Establishment Act of 2007. This legislation  will assist in the operation of school-  based health  clinics  (SBHCs) which  provide comprehensive and accessible  primary health care services to medically underserved youth.  Why is this legislation needed? Let’s  look at the facts. We have more than  eight million children in this country  who have no health insurance. According to recent data released by the Department of Health and Human Services, between 2003–2005, the percentage  of high school students who reported  smoking cigarettes was around 23 percent. In 2005, 30 percent of students in  grades 11–12 reported binge drinking,  which is five or more alcoholic drinks  in a row. Twenty-two percent of students in grades 11 and 12 reported using  marijuana in the past month.  In addition, the same Department of  Health  and Human Services  report  found that the United States spends  more on health per capita than any  other country. The  report,  ‘‘Health,  United States 2006,’’ specifically stated  that ‘‘much of this spending is for care  that controls or reduces the impact of  chronic diseases and conditions affecting an aging population.’’ Fewer dollars are spent on preventative care for  our children.  Another fact I would like to bring to  your attention is one found in a document released today by the United Nations Children’s Fund. The U.N. Children’s Fund  report  found  that  the  United States  ranks  last  in  child  health and safety, with the highest  rates of  relative  child poverty and  teenage obesity.’’  The points I have just made should  not only shock us, but should be a  wake-up call to each member of this  body and to the American people that  we need to take action and we need to  take it now.  With the introduction of the School-  Based Health Clinic Establishment Act  of 2007, Senator SMITHand I are seeking to change the data I have outlined.  School-based  health  clinics,  where  available, have a demonstrated record  of improving the health care of our nation’s youth. A study by Johns Hopkins  University found that SBHCs reduced  inappropriate emergency room use and  increased  primary  care  utilization,  which  resulted  in  fewer hospitalizations for those who used SBHCs. SBHCs  also  save money. For example,  the  Emory University School of Public  Health attributed a reduction in Medicaid expenditures related to inpatient  care and emergency department registration to the use of SBHCs.  In Connecticut, we have 73 school-  based health clinics. The SBHCs have  provided health care to many elementary, middle, and high school students  who would not have access to care if  SBHCs did not exist. The Connecticut  clinics provide an array of  services  such as comprehensive physical and  mental  health  assessments,  dental  care, asthma treatment, and conflict  resolution.  The bill we are  introducing today  will help enable school-based health  clinics  to  continue  providing  these  much needed services. Although these  clinics function totally in accordance  with state laws and regulations, the  federal government needs to provide  funding so these clinics can continue to  be a key component of our health care  delivery system.  This year, we will be working on the  reauthorization of the State Children’s  Health  Insurance Program  (SCHIP).  The program was created to provide  health care to millions of children who  were previously uninsured. SCHIP is an  outstanding  program.  I  believe  the  ‘‘School-Based Health Clinic Establishment Act of 2007’’ would be a good complement to SCHIP.  The School-Based Health Clinic Establishment Act of 2007 is an important  step in making sure that the next time  the United Nations Children’s Fund  issues  their  rankings  on  children’s  quality of life, that the United States  is no longer listed in last place. I look  forward to working with Sen. Smith  and my colleagues to see that this legislation is not only passed by this body  soon, but that it is signed into law.

407,15,2007-03-02,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, 46 years  ago, President John F. Kennedy proposed to the Congress one of the most  successful and influential programs in  the history of our Nation. It was on  March 1, 1961, that President Kennedy  asked the Congress to establish the  Peace Corps.  In making that request, President  Kennedy pointed out that the program  would be of great benefit to struggling  nations that were in ‘‘urgent need for  skilled manpower.’’ The program has  helped meet that need as more than  187,000 volunteers have served in the  Peace Corps since its inception, in 139  countries.  President Kennedy  also  explained  that the program would benefit developed nations as well.  ‘‘The future of  freedom around the world,’’ President  Kennedy explained,  ‘‘depend[s],  in a  very real sense, on the ability to build  growing and independent nations where  men can live in dignity, liberated from  the bonds of hunger,  ignorance, and  poverty.’’ In pursuit of the Peace Corps  mission of helping people help themselves  throughout  the world, Peace  Corps volunteers have served as school  teachers, economic development advisers,  agricultural  and  environmental  specialists, and in various capacities as  skilled laborers. These dedicated Americans have helped developing nations  with health and sanitation projects and  have assisted them in increasing their  agricultural  production.  They  have  helped these nations to combat diseases, including malaria and HIV/AIDS,  that have, for too long, plagued underdeveloped nations. Because of the outstanding work of  its volunteers, the  Peace Corps has become an enduring  symbol of the American commitment  to freedom through the encouragement  of the social, as well as the economic  progress of all nations.  And, in proposing the creation of the  Peace Corps, President Kennedy forthrightly acknowledged that American  self-interest was involved in the creation of the program. ‘‘Our own young  men and women,’’ he explained, ‘‘will  be enriched by the [Peace Corps] experience . . . an experience which will aid  them in their future careers.’’ And it  did.

408,4,2007-03-15,Mr. SESSIONS.," Madam Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  in  strong opposition to this closed rule  and to the financially irresponsible underlying  legislation. I also rise with  great regret to report to the American  people that for the third week in a row  the Democrat  leadership  is bringing  legislation  to  the House  floor  that  stacks the deck in favor of big labor  bosses at someone else’s expense.  Madam Speaker, in just a few minutes I am going to ask that we submit  this into the CONGRESSIONALRECORD,  but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill will cost a new  $20 billion for 4 years after it is implemented. $20 billion. Yet we have just  heard from the other side that this is  responsible and the right way to do  things. What do we expect? An additional $20 billion worth of spending. It  is a real sad day, Madam Speaker.  Two weeks ago, American workers  were the main losers in the Democrat-  controlled House when the majority  leadership  forced through  legislation  that would provide  for an unprecedented  intimidation of employees by  union bosses under a  fundamentally  anti-democratic  process  known  as  ‘‘card check.’’  Last week, in another unprecedented  expansion of Davis-Bacon to important  water projects across this country, the  Democrat leadership set its sights on  one of their all-time favorite targets,  the American taxpayer. Other  losers  that were targeted in that bargain included some other perhaps more surprising targets, including local communities, small and minority-owned businesses and, perhaps most of all, the environment.  But I suppose that that is everything  that the Democrat-controlled  leadership says is good. Everything is a fair  game when tilting the playing field in  favor of labor bosses. That is what this  new Democrat majority is about.  Given  this well-established  track  record, it should come as no surprise  that today, once again, the Democrat  majority has placed a bull’s eye squarely on the American taxpayers’ back on  the floor of this people’s House. The  legislation that we are being asked to  consider today represents the triumph  of politics over policy by attempting to  taint  every  government  contractor  with  the  high-profile  transgressions  that only a few have done.  I do commend Chairman WAXMAN for  his desire to provide proper and appropriate oversight for the use of government funds, and I do share his desire to  prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in government contracting. However, the approach that he has brought to the floor  is  far-reaching and  intrusive, expensive; and it misses the mark. The problem is primarily one of enforcement,  and this is where Congress should be  focusing its efforts on behalf of the taxpayer.  While these proposals may seem beneficial and look good on paper, in practice they add up restrictions upon restrictions simply for the sake of regulation. They would increase the cost  and reduce government access to the  solutions it needs, while increasing the  burden on an already-overworked Federal contracting workforce.  While I am concerned about fiscal responsibility as a Member of this body,  I do not believe that adding layer upon  layer of additional regulations is a way  to save taxpayer money or to be responsible.  Every day, private contractors provide  the entire Federal Government  with  effective  cost-saving  solutions,  and this legislation represents a large  step backwards in giving these contractors the flexibility they need to provide  these vital services. Rather than taking Chairman WAXMAN’s approach and  discouraging the vast majority of contractors that do not play by the rules  from wanting to do business with the  government, Congress should focus on  dealing with those bad actors that have  violated the public trust.  b1030  Right here on our Capitol campus,  private contractors provide us with the  services that we need to function on a  daily basis. They  include  inspecting  and delivering the mail, mowing the  Capitol grounds,  installing signs, repairing sinks, providing IT consulting  and technology systems maintenance,  and they do so at the lowest cost to  taxpayers through competition.  The Federal Government should not  be competing with a vibrant private  sector that can provide these services  better, faster, and cheaper than we can  do them ourselves. I find that a good  rule of thumb that I have used  for  years is if you can open up the Yellow  Pages and find professionals willing to  do the same services listed, then the  government should not try to perform  these tasks on its own, because it will  end up costing the taxpayers a great  deal more money.  Madam Speaker,  I  do understand  that  the Democrat Party wants  to  change this slowly and to stack the  deck in favor of big labor bosses whose  ranks have dwindled to 12 percent from  a high of 35 percent in the 1950s. I understand that a very few contractors  have behaved dishonorably and  illegally, and for that they should reimburse the taxpayer and be prosecuted  to the fullest extent of the law.  But I simply don’t believe that limiting the Federal Government’s flexibility to contract, especially  in the  case of an emergency, is the answer to  this problem. Nor do I believe that this  legislation that is a new private sector  mandate and that the CBO estimates  will cost taxpayers over $20 billion, 20  billion new dollars, should be considered reasonable or should be considered  financially responsible. This is not the  correct solution to this problem.  Madam Speaker,  I  include  for the  RECORDthe CBO cost estimate for H.R.  1362.  H.R. 1362—ACCOUNTABILITYINCONTRACTING  ACT  Summary: H.R. 1362 would amend federal  contracting rules. Specifically the  legislation would require federal agencies to limit  the length of noncompetitive contracts and  limit the use of solesource and cost-reimbursement contracts when possible. H.R. 1362  also would authorize an increase in funds  used to pay for contract oversight, planning,  and administration equal to 1 percent of the  value of an agency’s contracts. The legislation would require various reports to the  Congress on noncompetitive contracts and  contractor overcharges and amend employment restrictions on federal procurement officials.  CBO estimates  that  implementing H.R.  1362 would cost $20 billion over the 2008–2012  period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts  to provide additional  resources for contract oversight, planning, and  administration. That estimate does not include any costs or savings that could result  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:26 Mar 16, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K15MR7.007 H15MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2007

410,11,2007-03-15,Mr. LYNCH.," Madam Chair, I want to,  first of all, thank the gentleman for  yielding.  I rise in strong support of H.R. 1362,  the Accountability in Contracting Act.  This is contract reform legislation that  was reported favorably out of our Oversight Committee by unanimous consent, and I think that speaks to the  merits of this bill. As a result of the  hard work of Chairman WAXMAN and  Ranking Member DAVIS, this is a good  first step in bringing accountability to  contracting practices  in our government.  By minimizing  the use, as others  have said, of the abusive no-bid contract  practice, we will  reintroduce  competition into this contracting protocol used by our government. As well  as limiting the use of cost-plus contracts, we will strengthen the reporting and disclosure  requirements  for  contract  overcharges  and  increase  funding  for  contract  oversight  personnel. H.R. 1362 will address the glaring weaknesses in our Federal procurement system that have caused considerable waste, fraud, and abuse of American taxpayer dollars.  The need  to  reform Federal  contracting law has been with us for some  time and demonstrated, I think, glaringly during our series of contracting  hearings in the House Oversight Committee, as we continue to examine a  variety of misguided and poorly managed, poorly designed, and extremely  costly Federal  contracts  that have  been issued.  In the area of Iraq reconstruction,  where we have spent a lot of time, we  have learned from William Reed, the  Director of the DCAA, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, of more than $10  billion, 10 billion with a ‘‘b,’’ in questioned and unsupported costs related to  our Iraq reconstruction and troop support contracts. In addition, based on  updated data provided  to  the  committee  by  DCAA,  we  know  that  Halliburton’s three massive cost-plus  contracts alone are the source of at  least $2.7 billion in questioned and unsupported billings. And until recently,  unfortunately, we have not had auditors on the ground in Iraq. The DCAA  did not have contractors on the ground  to review these contracts. They were  auditing these contracts from Alexandria, Virginia. We have changed that  process and put people on the ground.  In the area of homeland security, we  recently examined the Department of  Homeland Security’s $24 billion contract to modernize the Coast Guard’s  aging fleet and the $30 billion SBInet  contract to design and  implement a  modernized border security plan. Based  on thousands of pages of documents  provided by DHS to our committee, we  have  learned  that  the Department’s  oversight of these massive contracts is  severely limited by what they call the  ‘‘prime  integrator’’ contracts. These  prime  integrator contracts vest  the  government oversight responsibility in  program design and construction  to  contractors to do this very work. In addition, we came to find out the Department had actually contracted out oversight  functions that  it had retained  under the contract terms.  This is a good first step. And I want  to give great credit to Chairman WAXfor his good work and also Mr.  DAVIS for building compromise in this,  and I think that the American taxpayers will be better served by the result of the work of these two gentlemen.

413,18,2007-03-15,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  strong support of H.R. 1362, the Accountability  in Contracting Act. With the alarming increase  of no-bid contracts and cost-plus contracts  under this administration, I am very gratified to  see the Democratic majority bring this bill up  for a vote so that we can put an end to these  scurrilous practices.  The United States government has paid  hundreds of millions of dollars in the past few  years to contractors that did not even have to  submit a bid for the work it wanted to conduct.  So much  for good old  fashioned American  competition! In addition, there have been very  few penalties  for  the contractors when  this  work went far over budget and Federal dollars  were misused  such  as  in  the Hurricane  Katrina  recovery effort. American  taxpayers  have had  to pick up  the  tab  for  these cost  overruns, and they have been on the hook for  millions and millions of dollars.  Mr. Chairman, in this week devoted to oversight legislation, this is a necessary bill to protect the taxpayers of this Nation from paying  too much for too little work. This bill will reduce  the number of no-bid  contracts and  strictly control cost overruns. Further, new  rules will be promulgated for disclosing contractor overcharges.  The Accountability in Contracting Act is long  overdue, and I thank the Speaker, the Majority  Leader, and Chairman WAXMAN for bringing  this bill up for a vote.  ",2007
414,18,2007-03-15,Mr. ARCURI.," Mr. Chairman, it is time to rein  in this administration’s prevalent use of no-bid  contracts.  I urge all my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support this rule and the  Accountability in Contracting Act.  In the last five years, spending on ‘‘no-bid’’  or ‘‘sole-source’’ contracts has more than doubled. The  administration  contends  that  in  every one of these cases there were ‘‘urgent  and compelling needs’’  that  required  these  contracts to be awarded without a competitive  bidding process. In the case of the emergency  response to disasters like hurricanes Katrina  and Rita, I don’t dispute that the need was urgent,  but  for  non-emergency  contracting  needs, we must get our fiscal house in order.  Just as any family has a budget to stick to,  shouldn’t we reach a point after an emergency  when there has been enough time to consider  multiple, competitive bids? A point after which  the  ‘‘compelling needs’’ are a  little  less urgent? By last June—nine months after Hurricane Katrina—$10.6 billion had been awarded  to private contractors for recovery efforts, but  only 30 percent of  that had been awarded  competitively.  I know of no small business in Upstate New  York, who could get by without  reasonably  budgeting for their expenses—even in times of  emergency. Why should  taxpayer dollars be  spent differently?  Oversight of  these contracts has been no  better. Audits have revealed that post-Katrina  contractors have over-billed, double-billed, and  billed for work that was never completed. The  Defense Contractor Audit Agency  found  that  through  fiscal year 2006, over $10 billion  in  contractor charges in Iraq have been identified  as ‘‘questioned’’ or ‘‘unsupported.’’  Under this administration, the use of ‘‘cost  plus’’ contracts has increased more than seventy-five percent. These cost-plus contracts  guarantee a contractor a fixed profit, regardless of how efficiently they spend the government’s money—taxpayers’ money. These contracts provide no  incentive  to  look after  the  bottom line because they guarantee there will  always be money off the top. When indefinite,  no-bid  contracts  contain  ‘‘cost-plus’’  provisions, the opportunity for foul play is only amplified.  The Accountability  in Contracting Act addresses  these concerns. This bill  limits  to  roughly 8 months the time that federal no-bid  contracts can  last.  It  requires each  federal  agency that has awarded at least $1 billion in  the preceding fiscal year to develop and implement a plan to minimize the use of contracts entered  into using no-bid procedures  and cost-reimbursement  type contracts. The  bill also establishes a system to increase competition in contract bidding and requires agencies that enter into a no-bid contract to make  ‘‘justification and approval’’ documents public  within fourteen days after awarding a contract.  Mr. Chairman, we have a responsibility to  the American people  to spend  their hard-  earned  tax dollars  in a  fiscally  responsible  way. And the Accountability in Contracting Act  will help reach  that end by providing much-  needed  transparency  to  the way  the  federal  government awards contracts.  ",2007

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS TO EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS NOT SUPPORTING U.S. DEFENSE EFFORTS.  An executive agency may not award a contract to an institution of higher education  (including any subelement of such institution) if that institution (or any subelement  of that institution) has a policy or practice  (regardless of when implemented) that either  prohibits, or  in effect prevents, the Secretary of a military department or the Secretary of Homeland Security from gaining  access to campuses of the institution, or access to students (who are 17 years of age or  older) on campuses, for purposes of military  recruiting, in a manner that is at least equal  in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any  other employer. For purposes of this section,  the term ‘‘institution of higher education’’  has the meaning provided in section 101 of  the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.  1001).

428,32,2007-03-15,Mr. MARKEY., Why do you think it is  so hard to convince people that we  don’t have the oil reserves that would  allow us to have a healthy relationship  with the rest of the world that does  have the oil reserves that ultimately  we are going to need to import if we  don’t change our habits?

429,32,2007-03-15,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland.," Well,  thank you. I think there are several  reasons for this. One is an irrational  confidence, worship almost, of the marketplace,  and  technology. And  the  third is that people just don’t like to  think about tough, hard things. I love  to think about those things because  there is no exhilaration like the exhilaration of meeting a big challenge and  overcoming it. So this is exhilarating  to me, and there are many people that  don’t like this. And my wife tells me  that I shouldn’t be doing this because  don’t you remember that  in ancient  Greece they killed the messenger that  brought bad news? And my response is  this is a good news story. If we start  today, we will have a less bumpy ride  than if we start tomorrow.  ",2007

432,32,2007-03-15,Mr. MARKEY.," You tell your wife  that in Massachusetts the messenger’s  name was Paul Revere and we actually  built statues to him up in Massachusetts for telling us the Red Coats were  coming, the British were coming, the  regulars were coming. And that is what  you are telling us right now, that at 60,  61 percent dependence upon imported  oil, we are heading inexorably towards  a very, very dangerous foreign policy,  national security crisis in our country  because we are averaging about 11⁄2percent per year increase in our dependency. So in order to move from 27 percent back in 1985, 1986 to 60, 61 percent  today, it just has to go up that much.  So if we come back here in 67 years and  we haven’t done anything, we will be  over 70 percent, 75 percent dependent  upon imported oil, all unnecessary if  we looked at the facts and looked at  the facts today and began to change  our national habits.  So tell your wife that Paul Revere is  more likely the analogy that applies to  you rather than the messenger that  they shot.  ",2007
433,32,2007-03-15,Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland.," I want  to thank my friend for joining me. This  is absolutely a bipartisan issue. I don’t  know that energy and oil knows the  difference between a Democrat and a  Republican. So I am very pleased that  you joined me on the floor.  I might say just a word about these  two philosophies that are keeping us  from really focusing on this issue. One  is an almost reference for the marketplace. There are many people who believe that the marketplace is both omniscient, it knows everything; and it is  omnipotent, it is all powerful and it  will solve everything. Well, I believe  the market  is really very powerful.  But, you know, there are some things  that even God can’t do. God can’t make  a square circle, can he? So there are  some  things  that  the marketplace  won’t be able to do.  I do not think that the market signals will be able to be responded to  quickly enough to meet this challenge.  If there were infinite resources, then  this blind faith in the market might  have some relevance. But there clearly  are not infinite resources. The amount  of oil out there is, in fact, finite.  The other is the near worship of scientists and technology: Don’t worry,  they will fix it. I mentioned to one of  our really high officials in government  that peak oil was a reality and that it  just wasn’t going to be there in the future in the amounts that we need for  our economy. And he said, Well, I guess  when that happens, the price will go up  and people will use less and they will  find something else and that solves the  problem. Don’t worry about  it, they  will fix it.  Well, I point to two different societies: The Mayan society down in Central America. That didn’t get fixed and  they are gone. Our cliff dwellers out in  the West. I am sure that a number of  folks have been there and seen those  cliffs, and their world is gone. And I am  sure when it was deteriorating, they  were saying to each other, Don’t worry,  they will take care of it.  Easter Island, a vigorous civilization  there, and when we finally found the  last survivors of it they were living in  caves. They were eating rats and each  other because they had done, in that  little part of the planet, what we may  one day do to our total planet; that is,  they were living beyond the renewable  resources of their little island there in  Easter Island and somebody didn’t fix  it. There wasn’t somebody there to fix  it.  The next chart looks at a number of  the experts and what their predictions  are as to when this peak oil that Mr.  MARKEYwas talking about is going to  occur. And we are now here in 2007 and  notice that there is a large number of  them here: Colin Campbell, Kenneth  Deffeyes, Matt Simmons. Several of  these I know personally. And their predictions are all in the very, very near  timeframe.  As  a matter  of  fact,  Deffeyes believes that we now have  passed peak oil. He said he used to be  a prognosticator and now he is an historian. He is now looking back at the  event of peak oil. And then we have a  few that believe it will be between 2010  and 2016. And then CERA. CERA is the  largest  one here. Shell. No  visible  peak. Very few who believe that it may  be some time off in the future.  We will have an opportunity in a few  moments to talk about CERA and some  of their projections. But notice that  most, the  large percentage of all of  those who have been looking at this  and studying this believe that peak oil  is either present or imminent.  The next chart is a really interesting  one. And if you had only one chart to  look at, this I think is the most instructive of all of the charts that we  have because on  this one chart,  it  shows the discovery, and that is the  large bars here. And you see that back  in the 1940s we were discovering lots  and in the 1950s, and, boy, in the 1960s  and 1970s huge amounts of oil. But notice what has happened. Since about  1980 it has been down, down, down. And  that is in spite of ever better technologies for discovering oil and ever  better incentives.  When Reagan came to office, that  was in 1980, and we were already 10  years down the other side of Hubbert’s  Peak; so we knew darn well that M.  King Hubbert was  right,  that  the  United States had reached its peak and  we were sliding down the other side of  the peak. And I really liked Ronald  Reagan. I can like a person without  liking everything that they do. And I  thought then and I am more convinced  now that his solution to this oil problem was totally the wrong solution. His  belief was that if you gave them a profit incentive they would go out there  and find it. So they gave them a profit  incentive, and, boy, did they drill. And  I don’t have it with me, but I have a  chart that shows the number of wells  that were drilled and how much oil was  found. And drilling didn’t help. You  can’t find what is not there and you  can’t pump what you haven’t found. So  in spite of ever better techniques like  3D seismic and computer modeling, we  now pretty much know what the whole  globe  looks  like geologically except  maybe we would like to know a little  more about Saudi Arabia and some of  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:07 Mar 16, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K15MR7.072 H15MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w 5 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2007
434,39,2007-03-15,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," I am  so glad that you went through those  benchmarks and  stressed  that  these  were the President’s benchmarks that  we used. The President, on January 10,  outlined the benchmarks for success,  that he felt were imperative that we  need.  Those were that we must give the  United States the authority to pursue  all extremists, we must rein in the militias and have Iraqis step up to the  plate to enforce security. They have to  decide how their oil revenues are going  to be distributed. That is a very important benchmark that has to be accomplished, and they have to pass reconciliation  initiatives  to keep  their  country together. Their country is essentially about to fall apart. They are  in the midst of civil war and are absolutely at the breaking point.  Besides those benchmarks that we  had  in  that  supplemental  that we  passed out of the Appropriations Committee today, and besides the incredibly necessary emergency funding that  the troops need and that our veterans  need, we also put provisions in that  legislation  to make  sure  that  our  troops can catch their breath.  I referred to that soldier who I met in  Walter Reed, whose  little boy  just  wanted him to come home, and who  had missed half his little boy’s life. We  have  soldiers, many, many  soldiers,  who have completed  three  tours of  duty, are about to go on their fourth,  who are deployed for 365 days and then  that deployment is extended.  The language we put in that bill ensures and says to the Army that they  need to make sure that those deployments are not beyond 365 days.  b1630  The President can waive that provision by submitting a report to Congress detailing why that unit’s deployment is in the interest of national security. But that is the kind of accountability that we are inserting to protect  our  troops,  to make  sure  that  the  President certifies that that deployment, that extension is absolutely essential to protect national security, despite the assessment that the unit is  not fully mission capable.  Our readiness is shot. We are spread  so incredibly thin, and we are talking  about the  impact on human beings’  lives.  How about the length of deployment?  The language in our bill requires the  Defense Department to abide by  its  current policy and avoid extending the  deployment of units in Iraq in excess of  the 365 days. We have to make sure  that those units are fully mission capable, and the time between deployments  is essential as well.  The Defense Department would be required to abide by, again, its current  policy and avoid sending units back  into Iraq before troops get the required  time out of the combat zone and training time, 365 days for the Army, and 210  days for the Marines. And the President can also waive that provision in  the interest of national security. He  just has to certify to Congress that  that is the case.  And that  is the kind of accountability that the American people insisted upon on November 7. They asked  us for a new direction, in the 6 in 2006  items of our agenda that we have already passed, and they insisted that we  move this war in a new direction so  that there would be an end in sight, so  that the President would no  longer  have a blank check, and so that we  could make sure we could protect our  men and women in uniform who are  SCHULTZ WASSERMAN protecting us. And I would be happy to  yield to the gentleman. And I am going  to have to take my leave of the gentleman because  I have  constituents  that are in town that I need to speak  with. I look forward to you carrying on  ",2007
435,39,2007-03-15,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," I look forward to  the old team being back down here.  And I just want to continue as to what  we are doing to try to fix this problem.  As I said, with the benchmarks and  making sure the Iraqi soldiers stand  up, but a key component of this, as Ms.  has  just mentioned is that we are saying that our  troops can’t  leave here,  the United  States, and go to Iraq if they don’t  have the requisite level of equipment  and training. And I don’t think there is  anybody  in  the country who would  want to send one of our soldiers or lots  of our soldiers off to war knowing, and  the legal term is mense rea, you know,  with intent, send kids that don’t have  the proper equipment and training.  And the training part is something  that Ms. WASSERMANSCHULTZwas just  talking about. We have a readiness crisis in the Army. We are not capable  now  of handling  another  situation,  military situation.  Now, I think if you would ask the  American people are we overstretched,  they would all say yes. And if you talk  to the military families, they say, yes,  we  are  overstretched  to  the  point  where we have kids in battle who don’t  have everything that they need. And  that  is unacceptable. And so  in our  supplemental bill, we are saying that if  you don’t have the training and the  equipment and the proper amount of  rest, you are not going.  Now, we put a waiver in there so that  the President could waive it if there is  a national security interest involved.  But we don’t like it. I know I don’t like  it. I shouldn’t speak on behalf of everybody.  But the bottom line is, the President  is the President. He is the Commander  in Chief. He won the election in 2004.  So we are left to deal with the situation.  And if you look at some of the polling in the country, 76 percent of Americans  favor requiring U.S. troops returning from Iraq to have at least 1  year  in the U.S. before being redeployed. That is a Gallup poll. Seventy-  seven  percent  favor  requiring U.S.  troops to come home from Iraq if Iraq’s  leaders fail to meet promises to reduce  violence there. And 76 percent of the  American people don’t think the Bush  administration  has  done  everything  they could reasonably be expected to  do to care for the needs and problems  of veterans.  But the bottom line is the American  people want accountability, and the  American  people  want  to  change  course. You don’t see the kind of tidal  wave election that we had in November  without a message that comes with it.  And the message is, we need to change  direction.

437,53,2007-03-15,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. President, I have not  had a whole lot to say in the Senate  about  the process,  the various proposals, and even the substance of the  Iraq resolutions. But it obviously is a  very troublesome issue for me.  One of my concerns is the process.  How bad could we possibly look as an  institution? We can’t come to an agreement on how to have a full debate and  votes. Everybody says we will agree to  this but not that, and it goes back and  forth. For the life of me, I cannot understand why we cannot have some  clear identification of some different  approaches to this issue and have debate and vote on them.  The majority  leader has to understand he cannot dictate what amendments the Republicans are going to  offer and the substance of those amendments or resolutions, if you will, any  more than we can dictate that to the  Democrats. It has to be a fair process.  I think that can be worked out. I know  our  leaders are talking—and  I wish  them the best—so that we can have debate and a vote on different approaches  and move on to other issues.  My  second problem  is, how many  iterations is this going to go through?  I remind my colleagues that the election is over. It was last year. All we  have been doing in the Senate is political partisan positioning, all sound and  fury, achieving nothing. What is the  score in the Senate? 0 to 0. Democrats  haven’t gotten anything done. Not one  bill of any substance that we have  passed has been signed into law, except  a continuing resolution, which we acknowledged had to be done to keep the  Government  operating  and,  frankly,  because we didn’t do our work like we  should have on that issue last year.  That is all. It is all about positioning.  There is one other score that is the  worst of all: Democrats, 0; Republicans,  0; American people, 0. We have to figure out a way to quit finding what we  can  disagree  about  and  find  some  things we can work together on for the  good of the people.  Regarding this Iraq issue, on the one  hand, we say we want to succeed. On  the other hand, you have the out-of-  Iraq caucus saying get out of there, set  deadlines, and withdraw the troops. We  say we are giving General Petraeus our  total confidence with a unanimous approval in confirmation. He is there trying to get the violence calmed down  and to do a better job and get an opportunity  for  their Government  to do  what it needs to do, have economic development. So while we are saying:  Congratulations, we all vote for you  and wish you will succeed, we are over  here doing things that could potentially undermine his ability  to get  them done.  You might say: Oh, well, that is not  really what is at stake with the Iraq  resolutions. Remember, to show you  what positioning is going on, today,  let’s say we come to the conclusion  that we are going to have two or three  different votes and we will finish at  some point this afternoon on the latest  iteration of the Reid positions and we  will move on to the budget. Well, the  problem with that is we have already  been told this will be back on the supplemental  appropriations—the  emergency appropriations to fund the needs  of our men and women in uniform. We  are being told: By the way, we are  going to put this restrictive language  on the funding resolution. So we are  going to revisit this  issue the week  after next.  I think what we are doing  is the  worst of all worlds. We have had nonbinding  resolutions  to  express  the  sense of the Senate, which is a misnomer in itself. Then, now we finally  come to what would be statutory language in a joint resolution by Senator  REID, which has deadlines and begins a  process of Congress micromanaging a  war.  We have tried it before and it didn’t  work, or it led to what some people  consider a disaster. For us to state  some opinions is one thing, but it has  gone beyond that now. This is going to  have an effect. I don’t think there is a  lot of language or a lot we can do that  can positively affect what is going on  in Iraq right now, but there is a lot we  can do that will negatively affect it.  So I think to start setting deadlines  and having  the Congress  trying  to  micromanage what is going on in Baghdad—we cannot even manage the process. How are we going to manage a  war? Even the New York Times—and I  don’t usually quote them because most  of the time I disagree with everything  they have to say—is raising questions  about  the  different  resolutions  and  what would be the effect of what we are  trying to do in the Congress about Iraq.  The Economist, I think the world’s  most respected magazine, said there is  actually progress being made. General  Petraeus  is doing  some  things  that  have made a difference. Maliki and the  Government  there are beginning  to  make  some decisions. We  say meet  your benchmarks, but as progress is  being made, we say: If you don’t do it  like we have outlined, we are going to  begin to just withdraw.  Mr. President, I wish my colleagues—  all of us on both sides of the aisle—  would think seriously about what we  are doing in Iraq.  Then also, of course, we are going to  go to the budget resolution next week.  I have been through a lot of budget  battles. Again, we are going to fuss and  we are going to fight and we are going  to have lots of amendments and we will  have a vote-arama, which is the worst  exhibition imaginable.

443,67,2007-03-15,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President,  the  Senate is now engaged in a historic debate about what the United States of  America should do with respect to the  conflict in Iraq. We are scheduled to  vote on three resolutions at 3:45 this  afternoon.  I was advised early  this  morning, about 8 a.m., that we would  have four resolutions to vote on and  that there would be a time agreement  of some 6 hours, with votes to occur  late this afternoon. Two of the resolutions among the four were not in existence, one of the resolutions has since  been dropped, and the fourth resolution  was made available less than an hour  ago. This kind of a timetable, it seems  to me, is not conducive to the kind of  deliberation and thought necessary to  make intelligent decisions on the momentous questions which we are facing.  We are asking the U.S. military to  adopt a timetable to clear out of Iraq  no later than a year from now, and we  have a tough time establishing even a  timetable as to what the Senate will do  in the course of a single day.  As I review the proceedings, it seems  to me that the Congress is not prepared  to act on this subject on this state of  the record. It may be that the Congress  is not competent to act on this kind of  an issue. There is a maxim that you  can’t manage  effectively  by  committee, and what this concurrent resolution seeks to do is to have management by two committees—that is perhaps twice as bad as trying to manage  by one committee—a committee of 435  in the House of Representatives and a  committee of 100 here.  Yesterday, I spoke briefly about S.  Res. 9, which has been cosponsored by  41 Democrats, no Republicans. I think  it is regrettable that there appears to  be a partisan divide on this subject.  This matter is too important to be determined by party loyalty. Perhaps a  more important aspect of noting that  the resolution is supported by 41 Democrats is that it is not supported by 9  Democrats, with 50 Democrats in this  body. So perhaps it is significant that  it is not supported by 9 Democrats.  I would be prepared to cross party  lines, as I have done in the past when  I thought it warranted, if I agreed with  the thrust of the resolution. Seven of  us joined with the Democrats in voting  for cloture several weeks ago to move  ahead with the debate and try to come  to a resolution on the Iraqi issue, and  I was one of the seven. I would not  hesitate to do so again if I agreed, but  I cannot agree with the proposal which  would require that not later than 120  days after enactment to have phased  redeployment of U.S. forces, with the  goal of redeploying by March 31, 2008,  all U.S. combat forces in Iraq except  for three conditions: to protect U.S.  and coalition personnel, training and  equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting  targeted counterterrorism operations.  The thrust, however, is to leave Iraq  in about 1 year, and that is to ensure  defeat. Setting a timetable simply enables our opponents to wait us out.  I think beyond that, the idea of having the Congress of the United States  micromanage the war is simply not realistic, and perhaps it may even be unlawful. As I noted yesterday, in the  case of Fleming v. Page, in 1850, the  Supreme Court said:  As Commander in Chief, he is authorized to  direct the movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at his command,  and to employ them in the manner he may  deem most effectual to harass and conquer  and subdue the enemy.  That is a fairly forceful statement  that it is not up to the Congress to  micromanage a war but that it is up to  the Commander in Chief, the President  of the United States.  That is not to say that the Congress  does not have authority in the premises. Yesterday, I put into the RECORD  a lengthy letter which I had written  calling for additional hearings by the  Judiciary Committee on the relative  powers,  authority  of  the  Congress  under the Constitution, with our power  of the purse and our power to maintain  and direct armies, contrasted with the  President’s power as Commander  in  Chief.  I believe, however, it is of questionable legal authority to micromanage,  and it is definitely impractical for us  to seek to micromanage  if the consequences of giving an order to the  President would just enable the enemy  to wait us out. That is not to say that  at some time in the future it may be  necessary, and there may be a considered joint judgment by the Congress, to  use  the extraordinary power of  the  purse to implement our constitutional  authority to maintain armies to effectuate a withdrawal.  Yesterday, I commented on the Senate floor that it would be most helpful  to have an update from the Department of Defense and the Department of  State as  to whether,  since General  Petraeus went to Iraq, implementing a  new strategy as he articulated it to  many of us in the Congress in meeting  with him, whether there have been improvements, so that there was some realistic prospect of victory, which  is  what we want. The consequences of defeat are disastrous, but that does not  mean that we can be in Iraq forever.  The President, in his State of the  Union speech, set two objectives  for  the Iraqis. One was to end the sectarian violence and, secondly, to secure  Baghdad as indispensable prerequisites  for maintaining U.S. forces in Iraq. The  Iraqis have shown neither the capacity  nor the will to carry out those objectives.  In evaluating the strategy of  General Petraeus, it would be helpful  to know if there have been any positive  signs or negative signs, giving us some  clue as to the prospects of victory.  Through staff, I made an inquiry of  the Department of Defense for some  updated material, and none was available. Similarly, through staff, I made  an inquiry of the Department of State,  asking if there had been any results  from the change in policy to negotiate  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:18 Mar 16, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G15MR6.023 S15MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 0 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

447,74,2007-03-15,Mr. REED.," Madam President, we are  debating a serious proposal with respect to the future of our involvement  in Iraq and the future of Iraq and, indeed, that region of the world. I believe  the proposal Senator HARRYREID of  Nevada advanced is a sensible way to  begin to change our policy, so it can be  sustained over time and it can lead to  a successful termination of our operations in Iraq but, more importantly,  give the Iraqis the opportunity to establish a stable government in a very  difficult part of the world.  The elements of the proposal that  Senator REIDhas advanced, are right  on target. First, to define the mission  in a way that they can be fully supported by the United States and also  that they are congruent with our best  interests in the region and the world.  Next, obviously, is force protection. We  have to be able to assure our forces  that they can protect themselves at all  times. Third, to continue to develop  the Iraqi security forces—not just to  put guns in their hands but to develop  their capacity to do other things, such  as civil affairs, intelligence operations,  those critical military skills that will  allow them to be an effective force in  their country, to bring not just stability but a sense of competence, coto  herence to the operation of their Government.  The next mission is the constant attention to counterterrorism. This is a  mission that I believe transcends every  border in the world. Wherever there are  those elements that are actively plotting to attack us or our allies, we  should be prepared, together with local  authorities, if they are cooperative, to  take these elements out very dramatically, preemptively. That is essentially  what we did in Somalia, without the  presence of hundreds of thousands of  American troops in Somalia. But we  had the special operations capacity, intelligence, and the cooperation of local  parties so we could do that.  Those are the three critical missions  I believe we have in Iraq that will be  longer term. But I think, also, when  recognizing  those missions, we  can  begin to recognize and begin to redeploy our  combat brigades  that are  there. They are essentially now engaged in a civil war, a sectarian battle  between the Sunnis and Shia in Baghdad, but not just there. These forces we  have to begin to redeploy away from  Iraq.  Initially,  they  could be  redeployed within the country, to adjacent  countries, and at some time back to  their home stations. I think this is the  wisest course.  I hope, as the legislation suggests, we  could at least have as a goal March of  2008 for the redeployment of these combat brigades, understanding that these  residual missions—force  protection,  training  Iraqi  security  forces,  and  counterterrorism—will endure. That is  a wise policy that is consistent with  our national security objectives and  also consistent with our ability and the  ability of the American people to sustain these efforts over many months.  The continued course of simply adding more troops and hoping  for the  best, which is the President’s strategy,  is not going  to work. More  importantly, I cannot see it being sustained  indefinitely by the American people or  supported by a terribly overstretched  military force, particularly our Army  and Marine Corps.  This whole approach to Iraq, I believe, from the very beginning, was a  flawed strategy. It disregarded fundamental aspects of any coherent strategy—identify the most serious threat  and apply adequate, very robust resources to the threat. Iraq wasn’t the  most serious threat in that region. Iran  is much more powerful and much more  potentially  dangerous  and,  also,  at  that juncture, the most serious threat,  and  still  lingering  are  the  international terror cells.  But this administration, against my  judgment, entered into this conflict in  Iraq. Not only did they have a flawed  strategy, but the execution has been  horrific,  incompetent. Today, we are  left with very few good choices. One of  the most revealing aspects of why the  strategic decisions made by the administration were so faulty was given a  few weeks ago when I asked Admiral  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:18 Mar 16, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G15MR6.040 S15MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 0 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007
448,81,2007-03-15,Mr. HATCH.," Madam President, I wish  to take this opportunity to explain  why I will vote against S. Res. 107.  First, I must applaud Senator MURRAY for what I believe was the overall  premise of her amendment, to show the  entire Congress’s resolve in supporting  our troops.  I fully agree with the portion of the  amendment that reaffirms the Senate’s  commitment  to providing  the  ‘‘necessary funds for training, equipment,  and other support  for troops  in the  field, as such actions will ensure their  safety and effectiveness  in preparing  for and carrying out their assigned duties.’’  This is a policy to which I have dedicated my entire Senate career.  However, as a lawyer, I believe that  it is also my duty to evaluate and work  toward ensuring  that all  legislation  which  the Senate passes  is  strictly  within the limits of our constitutional  powers. As the preamble states, ‘‘Under  the Constitution,  the President and  Congress have shared responsibilities  for decisions on the use of the Armed  Forces of the United States, including  their mission, and for supporting the  Armed Forces, especially during wartime.’’  Unfortunately, S. Res. 107 does not  meet that test. While at first glance  the passage I just cited may seem innocuous, the phrase  ‘‘shared responsibilities’’ raises important separation  of powers questions.  As we all know,  the Constitution  does not speak of shared powers,  it  speaks of the different branches of government having separate and distinct  powers—a point which is at the core of  the debate on our nation’s policies toward Iraq.  Under article II, section 2 of the Constitution, the President is the ‘‘Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy  of  the  United  States.’’  However,  Congress’s role is limited in article I,  section 8 which, in part, reads  ‘‘. . .  The Congress shall have power to . . .  provide for the common defense and  general  welfare  of  the  United  States. . . To declare war . . . to raise  and support armies . . . to provide and  maintain a navy . . . to make rules for  the government and regulation of the  land and naval forces; . . . to provide  for calling forth the militia to execute  the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel  invasions  . . . to  provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining,  the militia, and  for governing such part of them as may be employed  in the service of the United  States . . .’’  These are very different powers; they  are not shared. The Constitution provides for only one Commander in Chief.  Our  troops are  facing enough challenges  in  the  weeks  and months  ahead—they do not need to worry if  there will be 435 commanders in chief.  It  is  important that we remember  this point now more then ever. And so,  it is my analysis that the ‘‘shared powers’’ reference in S. Res. 107 clearly  raises  constitutional  concerns,  and  that is why I voted against S. Res. 107.  Madam President, I yield the floor.  ",2007

460,81,2007-03-15,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, what I  wish to do at this moment is address  one of the arguments  I have heard  many of my colleagues make over the  past 2 days of this debate. The argument I have heard when I was on the  floor yesterday, and again I have heard  it today, is that the joint resolution we  are debating  is an effort  to micromanage the war by focusing the mission of U.S. Armed Forces on training  Iraqis, denying terrorists a safe haven  in Iraq, and force protection.  If you listen to my colleagues who  oppose this, you hear them recount  that as if somehow that is exceeding  the power of  the people  to  speak,  through their Congress, as to what role  American military  forces  are  permitted to play. Many of my colleagues  on the other side go on to argue we are  somehow  overstepping  our  constitutional boundaries in defining the purpose for which U.S. forces can be used  in Iraq.  Well, that argument, I respectfully  suggest, is dead wrong. Defining the  overall mission of U.S. troops is entirely within the power of the Congress  under the U.S. Constitution.  Indeed,  not doing so would be an abdication of  our fundamental duty under the Constitution, which clearly manifests war  power in the hands of the Congress.  Now let me give you a few illustrations, if I may. In 2002, when we voted  to authorize the use of force against  Iraq, we defined the purpose. We defined the purpose for which the President was permitted to use American  forces against Iraq. It was to defend  the national security of the United  States against the continuing threat  posed by Iraq, and, further, to enforce  all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.  During the course of the negotiations  on that resolution, in which I was deeply involved, Congress made it clear, at  least on this side—as one of the several  people speaking for the Democrats at  the time in the Senate—we specifically  and clearly rejected the Bush administration’s  initial  proposal  for  using  force in Iraq. President Bush sought  what I believe to be, and the majority  of the Senate eventually did, an overly  broad authority to use force: to restore  international peace and security in the  region.  I read that at the time as a grant of  authority to the President that far exceeded what arguably was necessary at  all in Iraq. The function of our military  force was not to restore  international peace and security in the region. We struck that and said: The use  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:20 Mar 16, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G15MR6.066 S15MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 0 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

467,88,2007-03-15,Mrs. MURRAY.," Madam President,  the Senate is about to vote on the Murray  resolution. There  should be no  question that the Members of the Senate support our troops. We all do. In  this resolution, we want to make sure  we go on record saying we support our  troops from the time they go to battle  and are sent on their missions to the  time they come home.  We make very clear in the Murray  resolution that this Senate will go on  record saying the support of our troops  extends far beyond their mission in the  field. It means when they come home  and are sent to Walter Reed or one of  our other medical  facilities, we will  support them with what they need. It  says we will  support  their  families  throughout their  lifetime,  if that  is  what it takes, for their service to this  country.  I hope this is passed on a strong,  loud, bipartisan vote.  I yield the floor.  ",2007
468,88,2007-03-15,Mr. INHOFE.," Madam President, ironically, I agree with the Senator from  Washington, although I disagree with  the characterization of this resolution.  First of all, the resolution does essentially the same thing the Gregg resolution does. No. 1, the Gregg resolution uses the language that ‘‘Congress  should not take any action that will  endanger United States military forces  in the field.’’ That is exactly the same  language that is in the Murray resolution:  ‘‘Congress should not take any  action that will endanger the Armed  Forces.’’  The Gregg resolution talks about article II, section 2, of the Constitution,  in terms of the President’s constitutional powers, and article I, section 8 of  the power of Congress; and the Murray  resolution does essentially the same  thing, except it doesn’t cite it. It merely  says Congress and  the President  should continue to exercise their constitutional responsibilities.  So I am going to vote for the Murray  resolution and vote for the Gregg resolution. I don’t see any difference  in  them. I think we are supporting the  President, and this is the right thing to  do.  ",2007

479,95,2007-03-15,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, I rise to  commend the great State of Illinois for  receiving the National Award for Passing Most Local Smokefree Laws  in  2006. This honor was awarded to Illinois  by the national organization Americans for Nonsmokers Rights.  Last year, a recordbreaking 36 Illinois  cities  and  counties  enacted  smokefree laws, more than any other  State in the Nation. In doing so, Illinois has taken a firm stance against  the  devastating  consequences  that  smoking has on our communities.  The 2006 Surgeon General’s report,  ‘‘The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure  to Tobacco Smoke,’’  concluded  that  smoking  rooms  and  ventilation  systems  cannot  protect  people from secondhand smoke. The report reaffirmed previous health findings  that  secondhand  smoke  causes  heart disease, cancer, respiratory problems, and even death.  I am honored to acknowledge the  tireless efforts of public health advocates and State legislators who helped  make it possible. Before 2005, Illinois  communities  were  preempted  from  passing local laws. Now, the local community has the right to deal with this  important issue and help improve the  health of millions of Illinoisans. The  following communities have enacted  smokefree laws in the State: Arlington  Heights,  Barrington,  Bedford  Park,  Bloomington,  Buffalo  Grove,  Burr  Ridge,  Champaign,  Chicago,  Cook  County, Deerfield, DeKalb, Elk Grove  Village, Evanston, Hawthorn Woods,  Highland Park, Hinsdale, Hoffman Estates, Lake Forest, Libertyville, Lincolnshire, Lindenhurst, Long Grove,  McLean County, Mt. Prospect, Normal,  Northbrook, Oak Forest, Oak Park,  Orland Park, Palatine, Park Ridge,  Rolling Meadows, Sangamon County,  Schaumburg,  Skokie,  Springfield,  Tinley Park, Urbana, Vernon Hills,  Wheaton, and Wilmette.  Again, I extend my deepest congratulations to the citizens of Illinois, who  now can breathe a little easier.  f  SECURE  RURAL  SCHOOLS  AND  COMMUNITY  SELF-DETERMINATION ACT OF 2000  ",2007
480,95,2007-03-15,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to discuss the importance of the  need to reauthorize the Secure Rural  Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000.  This act expired September 30, 2006,  and now over 700 counties and 4,400  school districts in 39 States are in financial limbo.  In simple terms, this means that 8  million kids in rural America are going  to be impacted by Congress’s inaction.  This is simply unacceptable.  I have been joined by several of my  colleagues in introducing, S. 779, a simple  one  year  reauthorization. This  measure would provide some certainty  to the impacted counties and schools  while Congress works to address the  larger issue of a multiyear reauthorization.  It is clear to me that the safety net  payments need to continue, but in a  manner that encourages and focuses on  building collaboration—one of the cornerstones of this act.  For my colleagues who are unfamiliar with this issue, let me quickly  review how the Congress got to this  point.  In 1992, Congress provided some counties in the Pacific Northwest with a  temporary  financial  ‘‘safety net’’ to  help them transition from the timber  boom years of the 1980s.  The  safety net was  scheduled  to  gradually phase out over a 10-year period, but demands for a more inclusive  program resulted  in  its early termination and the enactment of another  temporary program, the Secure Rural  Schools  and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000.  This act was designed to allow counties an opportunity to transition back  to the traditional revenue sharing programs.  The temporary safety net was originally recommended to Congress by the  National Forest County Schools Coalition.  One  of  the  Coalition’s  principles  States that special payments to States  under this  legislation will provide a  short-term safety net with a specific  termination date.  The county payments program dramatically broadened the geographical  and substantive scope of the original  safety net payment.  The large majority of the funds still  were focused on the Pacific Northwest,  but  the new national program permitted most States and counties across  the country to participate and benefit  from it thus, providing a measure of financial certainty to all counties that  rely on revenues from Federal forest  lands.  The act has been an enormous success, not just achieving but surpassing  the goals of Congress.  This act has restored programs for  students in rural areas and prevented  the  closure  of  numerous  isolated  schools. It has been a primary funding  mechanism to provide rural school students with educational opportunities  comparable to those enjoyed by suburban and urban students.  Next, the act has allowed rural county road districts to address the severe  maintenance backlog. Snow  removal  has been restored for citizens, tourists,  and school buses. Bridges have been upgraded and replaced, and culverts that  are hazardous to fish passage have been  upgraded and replaced.  In addition, over 70 Resource Advisory Committees, or RACs, have been  formed.  Nationally,  these  15-person diverse  RAC  stakeholder  committees  have  studied and approved more than 2,500  projects on Federal forestlands and adjacent public and private lands.  These projects have addressed a wide  variety of  improvements drastically  needed on our public lands. Projects  have included fuels reduction, habitat  improvement, watershed  restoration,  road maintenance and rehabilitation,  reforestation,  campground  and  trail  improvement, and noxious weed eradication.  RACs are a new and powerful partnership between county governments  and the land management agencies.  They are rapidly building the capacity for collaborative public land management decision making in over 150 of  our largest forest counties in America  and are reducing the gridlock over public land management, community by  community.  In the future, I feel the RACs will be  providing the leadership to build consensus for projects that will keep our  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:35 Mar 16, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00046 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A15MR6.028 S15MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 0 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

",2007
482,102,2007-03-15,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I rise  today as the lead Republican sponsor of  the Genocide Accountability Act of  2007. I thank my colleague, Senator  DURBIN, for introducing this important  piece of legislation.  Senator DURBIN serves as the chairman and I serve as the ranking member  of the new Subcommittee on Human  Rights and the Law in the Senate Judiciary Committee. We held our  first  hearing, entitled  ‘‘Genocide and  the  Rule of Law,’’ on February 5, 2007.  There could not be a more appropriate  way to begin examining the law as it  relates to human rights than to determine what we can and must do to prevent and stop genocide. The United  States is a signatory of the Convention  on the Prevention and Punishment of  the Crime of Genocide. This convention  provides that the contracting parties  must  ‘‘undertake to prevent and to  punish’’ the crime of genocide. We have  also passed a  law  implementing the  Genocide Convention.  However, our hearing demonstrated  that there are changes that need to be  made in law and foreign policy to respond to the ongoing genocide in Sudan  and to any genocide that may occur  elsewhere in the future. Fortunately,  two of these changes can be accomplished right now.  The first change can be accomplished  through a bill Senators DURBIN and  CORNYN introduced last week, of which  I am a cosponsor. That bill, the Sudan  Divestment Authorization Act of 2007,  will allow State and local governments  to prohibit the investment of State assets in the Government of Sudan or  companies with certain business relationships with Sudan, while the Government of Sudan is subject to sanctions  under U.S.  law. The  second  change can be accomplished through  the bill we are introducing today, the  Genocide Accountability Act of 2007.  This act will ensure that our justice  system has the authority to prosecute  someone who has committed genocide  if that person is found or brought into  the United States.  Under current law, the United States  can deny admission  to and exclude  aliens  from  the United  States  on  human rights grounds. The Attorney  General can also consider avenues for  the prosecution of aliens who have  committed certain crimes,  including  genocide. However, the Attorney General can only prosecute a perpetrator  of genocide if he committed his crimes  within the United States or is a U.S.  national.

483,109,2007-03-15,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, today I  am introducing the Health Centers Renewal Act with my colleagues, Senators KENNEDY, ROBERTS, DODD, BOND,  HARKIN, SNOWE, MIKULSKI, DOMENICI,  BINGAMAN, MURKOWSKI, REED,  NETT,  CLINTON,  GRASSLEY,  OBAMA,  BENBURRand BROWN.  The Health Centers program, created  over 40 years ago, has an outstanding  record of providing quality health care  services to many Americans who do  not have adequate health  insurance.  This ranges from children to parents  and grandparents,  in virtually every  comer of the United States. In fact,  Health Centers are a necessary component of our nation’s health care safety  net—they  supply health  services  to  over 15 million people in our country.  Health Centers  include community  health centers, which are local, not-  for-profit  50l(c)(3)  corporations  that  give community-oriented health care  and are governed by Boards of Directors that are made up of at least 51 percent health centers patients, to ensure  that the patients and their communities are well represented.  From my work in Utah, I know how  important Health Centers are. They  have made a tremendous difference for  Utah’s citizens with insufficient health  coverage—Utah community health centers  serve  close  to  85,000  patients.  Whenever I come home to Utah, I always hear wonderful things about the  work of Community Health Centers.  Since 2001, Congress has consistently  increased  funding  for  Community  Health  Centers  to meet  President  Bush’s goal of having 1,200 new or expanded centers. The new dollars have  provided services to four million new  patients and have added facilities in  over 750 communities across the country. By  reauthorizing  this program,  Health  Centers  will  give  low-cost  health care to many more deserving individuals.  S. 901 I will reauthorize the Health  Centers program for 5 more years; it  includes funding levels of: $2,188,745,000  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:48 Mar 16, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00060 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G15MR6.068 S15MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 0 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007
484,116,2007-03-15,Mrs. CLINTON.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to  introduce the Gestational  Diabetes Act of 2007 with my colleague  Senator COLLINS, to bring attention to  an  important  health  issue  facing  women and children.  I don’t need to tell anyone that we  have an obesity epidemic in the United  States. Many of us realize that as parents, it is our responsibility to pass on  good nutritional habits to our children.  But many women may not realize that  watching what you eat, exercising regularly, and having  control of your  blood sugar levels are serious health  considerations  during  pregnancy.  In  fact, these factors are serious enough  that they can affect both the health of  the mother and the life of the child  into adulthood.  More women than ever are entering  their pregnancies overweight but without an understanding of how their own  weight and nutritional habits can trigger gestational diabetes—a type of diabetes that only occurs during pregnancy. Women who are overweight before pregnancy are not only at greater  risk of having gestational diabetes but  are also more likely to have a c-section  and are at an increased risk for other  serious pregnancy complications.  In New York, gestational diabetes is  on the rise. In New York City alone,  gestational diabetes has risen by nearly 50 percent in about 10 years. This  means that gestational diabetes affects  1 in 25 women, about 400 women per  month. But across the Nation, between  4 and 8 percent of pregnant women in  the United States are affected by gestational diabetes.  Infants of women  who have gestational diabetes are at  increased risk for obesity and developing type 2 diabetes as adolescents or  adults.  As women, we need to pay attention  to our health. We are always worrying  about the health of our children, our  husbands, and our parents, but we  often forget to take care of ourselves.  Today, I am introducing the Gestational Diabetes Act, also known as the  GEDI Act. This  legislation will  increase our understanding of gestational  diabetes by determining  the  factors  that contribute to this condition and  help mothers who had gestational diabetes reduce their risk of developing  type 2 diabetes post-pregnancy.  The GEDI Act will provide funding  for projects to assist health care providers, as well as for communities to  find ways to reach out to women so  that they understand how their own  good health during pregnancy can decrease serious health risks  for their  children.  The GEDI Act would expand research  to determine and develop interventions  to lower the incidence of gestational  diabetes. We need to alert women to  the risk before this condition becomes  an epidemic and, as we have seen so  many times before, education is critical.  We should be doing everything we  can to address the impact of obesity  during pregnancy and to reduce the  prevalence of gestational diabetes  in  pregnant women. The GEDI Act is an  important step in assuring that women  understand this critical issue and that  we fully understand how to equip pregnant women to make the best choices  for their health.  The GEDI Act is supported by the  American Diabetes Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, National Research Center for  Women & Families, International Community Health Services, American Association of Diabetes Educators, and  the American Association of Colleges  of Pharmacy.  By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself,  Mr. AKAKA, Mr. KERRY,  and  Mrs. CLINTON):  S. 909. A bill to amend title XIX of  the Social Security Act  to  permit  States, at their option, to require certain individuals to present satisfactory  documentary evidence of proof of citizenship or nationality for purposes of  eligibility for Medicaid, and for other  purposes;  to  the Committee on Finance.  ",2007
485,116,2007-03-15,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, the  legislation I am introducing today is  designed to make several very important changes to current law to ensure  that U.S. citizens receive the Medicaid  to which they are entitled.  Since July 1, 2006, most U.S. citizens  and nationals applying for or renewing  their Medicaid coverage  face a new  Federal requirement to provide documentation of their citizenship status.  Recent reports indicate that tens-of-  thousands of U.S. citizens, and in particular  children,  inappropriately are  being denied Medicaid benefits simply  because  they  don’t have  access  to  newly required documentation. The articles below and report by the Center  on Budget and Policy Priorities highlight this very serious problem. Hospitals, physicians, and pharmacies may  not be willing to treat these individuals until they have a source of payment, but they cannot qualify for Medicaid until they produce a birth certificate and ID.  This new Federal requirement was  added to Medicaid by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, DRA, enacted February  8,  2006. The Tax Relief  and  Health Care Act of 2006, TRHCA, signed  into law December 20, 2006, included  some amendments to the DRA citizenship documentation requirement, primarily to exempt certain groups. Prior  to enactment of the DRA, States were  permitted to use their discretion in requiring  such  citizenship documentation.  Under Section 6036 of the DRA, citizens applying  for or renewing their  Medicaid coverage must provide ‘‘satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship  or  nationality.’’ The DRA  specifies documents that are acceptable for this purpose and authorizes the  HHS Secretary to designate additional  acceptable  documents.  No  Federal  matching funds are available for services provided to  individuals who declare they are citizens or nationals unless the State obtains satisfactory evidence of  their citizenship or determines that they are subject to a statutory exemption.  It is important to note that citizenship documentation  requirements do  not affect Medicaid rules relating to  immigrants—they apply to individuals  claiming to be citizens. Most new legal  immigrants are excluded  from Medicaid during their first 5 years in the  U.S. and undocumented immigrants remain eligible for Medicaid emergency  services only.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  would make  several very  important  changes to current law to ensure that  U.S. citizens receive the Medicaid to  which they are entitled.  First, the legislation would restore  citizenship verification to a State option. Specifically, States would be permitted to determine when and to what  extent citizenship verification  is required of U.S. Citizens. States would  also be permitted to utilize the standards most appropriate to the their population as long as such standards were  no more stringent than those currently  used by the Social Security Administration and includes native American  tribal documents when appropriate.  Second, the legislation would ensure  that individuals are afforded a reasonable time period to provide citizenship  documentation utilizing the same reasonable time period standard that is  available to legal immigrants to provide satisfactory evidence of their immigration status.  Third the legislation protects children who are U.S. citizens by virtue of  being born in the United States from  being denied coverage after birth because of  citizenship verification  requirements.  Fourth, the legislation also clarifies  ambiguities in federal law to ensure  that these citizen children, regardless  of the immigration status of their parents, are treated like all other low-income  children  born  in  the United  States and are deemed eligible to receive Medicaid services for one year.  Finally, the legislation also ensures  that the thousands of citizen children  and adults, who were erroneously denied Medicaid coverage, may receive  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:07 Mar 16, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A15MR6.075 S15MRPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 0 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘The American National Red Cross Governance Modernization Act of 2007’’.  SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.  (a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes  lowing findings:  (1) Substantive changes to the Congressional Charter of The American National  Red Cross have not been made since 1947.  the  fol(2) In February 2006, the board of governors  of The American National Red Cross (the  ‘‘Board  of Governors’’)  commissioned  an  independent review and analysis of the Board  of Governors’ role, composition, size, relationship with management, governance relationship with chartered units of The American National Red Cross, and whistleblower  and audit functions.  (3) In an October 2006 report of the Board of  Governors, entitled  ‘‘American Red Cross  Governance for the 21st Century’’ (the ‘‘Governance Report’’), the Board of Governors  recommended changes to the Congressional  Charter, bylaws, and other governing documents of The American National Red Cross  to modernize and enhance the effectiveness  of the Board of Governors and governance  structure of The American National Red  Cross.  (4) It is in the national interest to create a  more efficient governance structure of The  American National Red Cross and to enhance  the Board of Governors’ ability to support  the critical mission of The American National Red Cross in the 21st century.  (5) It is in the national interest to clarify  the role of the Board of Governors as a governance and strategic oversight board and  for The American National Red Cross to  amend its bylaws, consistent with the recommendations described in the Governance  Report, to clarify the role of the Board of  Governors and to outline the areas of its responsibility, including—  (A) reviewing and approving the mission  statement for The American National Red  Cross;  (B) approving and overseeing the corporation’s strategic plan and maintaining strategic oversight of operational matters;  (C) selecting, evaluating, and determining  the level of compensation of the corporation’s chief executive officer;  (D) evaluating the performance and establishing the compensation of the senior leadership team and providing for management  succession;  (E) overseeing the financial reporting and  audit process, internal controls, and legal  compliance;  (F) holding management accountable for  performance;  (G) providing oversight of the  stability of the corporation;  (H) ensuring the inclusiveness and diversity of the corporation;  (I) providing oversight of the protection of  the brand of the corporation; and  (J) assisting with fundraising on behalf of  the corporation.  (6)(A) The selection of members of the  Board of Governors is a critical component  of effective governance  for The American  National Red Cross, and, as such, it is in the  national  interest that The American National Red Cross amend its bylaws to provide  a method of selection consistent with that  described in the Governance Report.  (B) The new method of selection should replace the current process by which—  (i) 30 chartered unit-elected members of  the Board of Governors are selected by a  non-Board committee which includes 2 members of the Board of Governors and other individuals  elected by  the  chartered units  themselves;  (ii) 12 at-large members of the Board of  Governors are nominated by a Board committee and elected by the Board of Governors; and  (iii) 8 members of the Board of Governors  are appointed by the President of the United  States.

CHARLES B. RANGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 15, 2007  ",2007
503,144,2007-03-15,Mr. RANGEL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to recognize the birth anniversary of General  Casimir Pulaski, the Polish Hero of the Revolutionary War.  Often referred to as the father of American  cavalry, Kazimierz Michal Waclaw Wiktor Pulaski herbu Slepowron, more commonly  referred  to as General Casimir Pulaski, was  born in 1746 in Winiary. Born into one of the  most notable  families  in  the region, he was  sent away at a young age to be educated.  Working alongside his father Jozef in 1768,  Pulaski co-founded the Bar Confederation, an  insurrectionists group  that aimed  to  limit  the  spread of Russian hegemony, a threat to Policy  liberty and Catholicism,  throughout  the  commonwealth. With the motto of ‘‘For Faith  and Freedom,’’ Pulaski participated in leading  a confederation which fought for these goals.  Pulaski gained  renown during  the battle of  1771 and went on  to assert his  leadership  skills, military adroitness and valor in several  battles before being exiled for a failed attempt  to abduct the king. Although his efforts failed,  Pulaski’s  leadership  and  courage  inspired  many.  In  1777 Pulaski  traveled  to  the United  States and met with General George Washington. Pulaski transformed soldiers into highly  mobile forces, instituting the idea of a cavalry;  soldiers who  fought mounted on horseback.  He would go on  to  lead several successful  battles  before  sustaining  a  fatal  gunshot  wound in 1779.  Americans and Polish citizens alike have  recognized Pulaski’s heroism and commitment  to  freedom  for centuries. He  is honored,  in  both countries, in statue and in ceremony. In  death, as in life, he remains a symbol of courage, commitment and friendship between Poland and the United States.  f  TRIBUTE TO JOHN GAINES  HON. JANE HARMAN  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 15, 2007  ",2007
504,144,2007-03-15,Ms. HARMAN.," Madam Speaker,  the community of EI Segundo, located in my congressional district, sustained a genuine  loss  this  week. John Gaines, a former member of the  EI Segundo City Council, highly  influential  community  leader, and my dear  friend, succumbed on Monday night following an inspirational battle against a rare form of cancer.  John was a terrific guy. Even as he struggled with his  illness, John never  lost heart,  and continued to be a rock for his family and  friends. When  I  last saw him only a  few  months ago, he told me his doctors had advised that he move up the date of his daughter’s December wedding.  In  typical  John  Gaines fashion, he not only ignored their advice, he walked his daughter down the aisle.  He even joked with me that, having lost 100  pounds, he had become an adult sex symbol  in his form-fitting blue jeans. This kind of levity  in a time of extreme pain and uncertainty is a  powerful testament to who John Gaines was:  strong, compassionate, and charismatic.  Though it ended too soon, John led a full  and accomplished  life. A  long-serving Naval  Officer and Aviator, he attained  the rank of  Lieutenant Commander by  the  time he  left  military service in 1979.  Following his naval service, John returned  to Southern California to start a distinguished  career in the South Bay’s booming aerospace  industry. He quickly became an industry leader and worked at senior levels for some of the  region’s leading firms.  Ironically, it took the prodding of his son to  get John  into politics. But once elected, he  was a natural and I believe John will be remembered most for his unwavering dedication  to public service.  As a member of the EI Segundo City Council, he made emergency preparedness, homeland security and community development priorities. During his  tenure, John was  instrumental in securing funds to better prepare El  Segundo for any possible man-made or natural disasters. He also oversaw projects that  helped to revitalize the city’s downtown.  Over the years, John had a profound influence on so many people and literally helped  change the face of his community. He and Assemblyman Mike Gordon, our mutual  friend  who died at age 47 of a brain tumor in 2005,  are now local legend. John’s wife, Susan, told  me she is certain they are reunited.  My heart goes out to his wife Susan and  their three children, Rebecca, Robert and Benjamin. Susan says the two boys are so much  like their father. How fortunate!

505,151,2007-03-15,Mr. HIGGINS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  to  commend Father Robert Anthony Mack for his  50 years of service as an ordained priest, and  his  significant  contributions  to  the western  New York community and Catholic Church.  Father Mack will be honored  in a special  Mass at Saint Louis Parish on Sunday March,  25, and  today  I honor his accomplishments  and devoted service to his parish and community.  A passionate and dedicated man, his contributions to Buffalo include service as chaplain of Nardin Academy, Catholic chaplain of  the Buffalo Fire Department, chaplain at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium and War Memorial  Stadium, and division chairman of the Public  and Service Division of the Erie County United  Way.  A native of Riverside, Father Mack’s  first  pastorate began  in 1973 at Saint Matthew’s  Parish in Buffalo where he served until 1978.  Father Mack also served as pastor of St.  Bridget’s in Newfane, NY, as well as at Saint  Francis Xavier Parish of Buffalo. During his  time at Saint Francis Xavier, Father Mack  served as regional coordinator  for Region 1  parishes and was a member and secretary of  the Black Rock Riverside Clergy Association.  In August 1989, Father Mack was honored in  front of 25,000 people as Irishman of the Year  at a home game of the Buffalo Bisons by the  United Irish American Society of Erie County.  Father Mack also served as the pastor of All  Saints and served as an administrator of the  Rosary Parish in Niagara Falls before being  appointed pastor of St. Louis Parish where he  retired from in 2002. Father Mack also chaired  the Peace and  Justice Committee of  the  Priests’ Senate and was appointed to the Arbitration Section of the Diocesan Due Process  Committee.  Madam Speaker, Father Mack’s experience  during his 50 years as an ordained priest is  unrivaled  in our community. He has been a  leader and an inspiration to countless parishioners and to the community at large. Father  Mack is one of Buffalo’s most prolific men of  faith and on this special occasion, I recognize  his vast accomplishments and dedication  to  our community.  f  RECOGNIZING  RETIRING  SUISUN  CITY POLICE CHIEF RON FORSYTHE  HON. ELLEN O. TAUSCHER  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 15, 2007  ",2007
506,151,2007-03-15,Mrs. TAUSCHER.," Madam Speaker, I rise to  recognize Suisun City Police Chief Ron Forsythe, who after nearly 30 years of service to  the community of Suisun City has retired from  the Suisun City Police Department.  Chief Ron Forsythe has unselfishly served  his community with great dedication and pride,  and will leave the department with special recognition and with the highest commendation.  Chief Forsythe began his professional career in 1973, as a student aide in the Daily  Republic  newsroom,  eventually  being  promoted to reporter and photographer.  His time spent in the newsroom piqued his  interest in law enforcement. In 1977, he became a dispatcher and reserve police officer  for the Suisun City Police Department. Working his way up the ranks, Chief Forsythe was  promoted to chief of police in 1993.  During his career in Suisun City, Chief Forsythe was known for his innovative and forward  thinking policies. He  took  leadership  roles in introducing technology, such as automation and car-mounted computers to the department.  Chief Forsythe also instituted the first ‘‘citizen police academy’’ in the county and later  introduced  the  first  ‘‘teen academy’’  in  the  country. Moreover, Chief Forsythe’s role in implementing community policing in Suisun City  played a key role in turning around a city that  was once considered the worst city in the bay  area to live in.  Police Chief Ron Forsythe has served the  citizens of Suisun City with great distinction,  evidenced  by  policing  policies  that  have  served as nationwide models and the numerous State and national awards the department  received.  As Chief Ron Forsythe  retires  from  the  Suisun City Police Department, I would like to  thank him, and his partner, Matthew Forsythe,  for his record of service and concern for the  protection of life and property in the local community, and extend to him sincere best wishes  for continued success in his future endeavors.  f  JUDGE ELISEO B.

507,151,2007-03-15,Mr. ORTIZ.," Madam Speaker,  the nation—  and South Texas—lost  a  valuable  patriot  today with the passing of longtime Port Isabel  municipal judge and community leader Eliseo  B. Vega. Known affectionately as  ‘‘Cheo,’’  Judge Vega died following a lengthy illness.  Judge Vega was an extraordinary caring  and hardworking man. He was a familiar face  in  the Port  Isabel area and was a political  powerhouse. Despite his several setbacks due  to  illness, when most would  think  that he  couldn’t pull through, the man just kept going  and wouldn’t miss working. He was a man of  great faith and loved life fully. He loved life so  much he didn’t want a sad funeral, so we will  celebrate his life this week.  His  life  touched so many people. Judge  Vega was best known for his role as judge in  the municipal court system. His lengthy judicial  career, beginning  in 1971, spanned generations. He was what you wanted a judge to be:  fair and even-handed. He understood people,  he understood  justice, and he stood at  the  intersection of both.  Prior  to his  legal and  judicial career,  the  Judge was a banker and also served in a law  VerDate Aug 31 2005  07:08 May 11, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD07\E15MR7.REC E15MR7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2007

515,1,2007-03-23,Mr. KUCINICH.," Four years ago, Congress was told we had no alternative  but to go to war; that was wrong. Now  Congress is telling the American people we have no alternative but to continue the war, and that by continuing  the war for just another year or two we  will then be able to end the war. War  equals peace. I don’t think so.  This war has achieved a momentum  that has swept up into its tragic hold  people  of  otherwise  good will who  would vote to continue a war when  they really want peace and when the  American people want peace.  I believe you cannot say you are for  peace and vote to keep this war going.  You cannot say you are for peace and  facilitate the theft of Iraqi oil. You  cannot say you are for peace and give  the President enough money not just  to keep this war going, but to attack  Iran  if he  so chooses.  If you want  peace, vote for peace now. If you want  peace, stop funding this war. If you  want peace, stand for the truth.  What America must do and what  Congress has the power to do is to stop  the war now, use the money in the  pipeline to bring the troops home, set  in motion a diplomatic process that  would involve the world community in  moving into Iraq as our troops move  out. We need to stand for peace. H.R.  1234 is the vehicle to do that.  f  WE WILL NOT RUN FROM DUTY  (Mr. POE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2007

We vote to retreat even  if  it  means defeat. We vote to quit while  our troops are in the field. And we vote  for peace at any price.  This bill will put American troops at  risk.

555,8,2007-03-23,Mr. EMANUEL.," Mr. Speaker, today  this Congress, the 110th Congress, faces  an historic vote, a vote to truly change  the direction of the Iraqi conflict.  Let us review the cost America has  borne in 4 years: 3,200 lives have been  lost, 25,000 of our citizens have been injured, and nearly a half a trillion dollars have been spent, and America’s  reputation around the world has been  sullied.  And under the President’s leadership,  his Iraqi policy comes down to something very simple: more troops, more  money, more time, more of the same.  That is it.  Now, there is a lot of rhetoric going  around. We fund our troops. You fund  the troops. There is one fundamental  difference: We require the  Iraqis to  bear responsibility for Iraq, and you  provide them and the President another blank check  for another year.  And that is the fundamental difference,  whether you will bring accountability  and  responsibility  to  the  Iraqis  to  stand up for Iraq.  Now, some bemoan and say we are  micromanaging. I would say to you,  you rubber-stamped 4 years of mismanagement. Not enough troops, not a  plan  for  the occupation and  elimination of the Iraqi Army has brought  us in from in search of WMD to policing a sectarian civil war.  And when you talk, as the President  said on January 10, that he wants the  Iraqis to meet his benchmarks, but you  don’t have any benchmarks or any accountability for Iraq, I can only say  one  thing,  as we  say  in Chicago,  ‘‘You’re all hat and no cattle.’’  It is time, after 4 years and an unbelievable  cost across America, borne  mostly by our troops and their families  and our military,  that we ask  the  Iraqis to do for Iraq what they have  asked us to do for them for 4 years, and  that is to be accountable for their own  future.  And I am proud that we have finally  done  something. We will  fund  the  troops, and we will also demand that  Iraq stand up for Iraq’s future and stop  leaning on America alone.  And we have done something that is  so important that has been missing in  this policy, and that is not only a new  direction, but fundamentally bringing  the responsibility and accountability  to the Iraqis, which is why many in the  Armed Forces are happy we are forcing  Iraqis to do for Iraq’s future what they  have asked us to do, which is stop policing their civil war, but demand accountability, bring a new direction to  this,  because  after  4  years, more  troops, more money, more time is only  rubber-stamping more of the same.

But there is another aspect to this  bill. There are literally 2 million children who are without health care. I  want to at this point recognize and  give due thanks and appreciation to  Congressman JOHNMURTHA. No State  has suffered because of the CHIP program  as  the  children  of Georgia’s  273,000 children who would be without  their health insurance if it were not for  this war supplemental.  When the  issue was taken to the  White House, he said no. All hope was  gone. I went to JOHNMURTHA, and JOHN  MURTHAsaid, we will help you, and we  will attach it to the Iraqi war supplemental. And he took it to Mr. OBEYand  to the Speaker.  Ladies and gentlemen, I make this  plea  to you, as  the Scripture  says  clearly, suffer not the little children.  This is the only hope for getting our  insurance  for  our  children  in  the  SCHIP program. I urge you to not let  the children of the United States of  America go down the drain.

562,15,2007-03-23,Mr. FRANKS of Arizona.," Mr. Speaker, before we vote on this bill, we need  to remind ourselves one more time, the  jihadist terrorism is what this debate  is all about.  Brink Lindsey put it in such succinct  terms when he said, ‘‘Here is the grim  truth: We are only one act of madness  away from a social cataclysm unlike  anything our country has ever known.  After a handful of  such acts, who  knows what kind of civilization breakdown might be in store?’’  Mr. Speaker, as we anticipate future  actions of jihadists and our place in  Iraq, we would do well to consider their  words very carefully. Al Qaeda’s al-  Zawahiri said this: ‘‘The jihad movement is growing and rising. It reached  its peak with the two blessed raids on  New York and Washington. And now it  is waging a great heroic battle in Iraq,  Afghanistan, Palestine, and even within the crusaders’ own homes.’’  Osama bin Laden himself said: ‘‘The  most important and serious issue today  for the whole world is this third world  war. It is raging in the land of the two  rivers,’’ Iraq.  ‘‘The world’s millstone  and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of  the caliphate.’’  Mr. Speaker, if Democrats are correct that the struggle in Iraq is not  crucial  to winning  the war against  jihadism, then for God’s sake, I wish  they would explain that to the terrorists. Instead, we hear the most senior  Democrat in this House quoted as saying, ‘‘I don’t take sides for or against  Hezbollah, or for or against Israel.’’  Mr. Speaker, a blind relativism that  deliberatively  ignores all  truth and  equates merciless terrorism with free  nations defending themselves and their  innocent citizens is more dangerous to  humanity than terrorism itself, and it  is proof that liberals completely misunderstand the enemy that we face.  Because of this kind of relativist neutrality, jihadists now believe they have  a crucial advantage over the free world  and its people. They believe their will  is far stronger than ours, and that they  need only to persevere to prevail.  Mr. Speaker, the passage of this bill  will only encourage them in that belief. And if liberals in this body are  willing to see freedom defeated in Iraq,  they must also be willing to take responsibility for almost certainly what  will follow.  Mr. Speaker,  finally, we can have  peace with jihadists tomorrow if we are  willing to surrender today. And that  kind of  surrender will be on  their  terms, and it will ultimately bring a  nuclear jihad to our children. Future  American generations will despise this  one.  Mr. Speaker, there is still time to defeat this bill. Let us not take this ominous step in this direction.  ",2007
563,15,2007-03-23,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I understand that at the  end of the debate the closing speech on  the Republican side will be given by  our good friend from Texas ",2007
564,15,2007-03-23,Mr. JOHNSON.," I think everyone in this place respects him and loves him.  I must say that having gone through  this for the last 3 weeks trying to talk  to each and every person who I could  reach about this measure has given me  a profound respect for a good many  Members of this  institution whom I  had not known before, especially the  newcomers.  The caucus that we had this morning  was one of the most moving experiences that I have ever felt in my 38  years in the Congress. I heard Member  after Member stand up and discuss this  issue as a matter of high principle; but  they also discussed it in terms of what  the impact of their votes would be, not  on themselves, but on the people of  this country, on the soldiers who are  fighting in the field, on the people in  Iraq, and on our country’s ability to influence the world.  This is a very tough issue. There are  many considerations that each of us  brings to this judgment, but in the end,  I think we have a choice. As I said earlier today, we have a choice in determining what kind of Congress this is  going to be. We can continue the practices of the past which rubberstamped  virtually  everything  the  President  wanted on Iraqi policy. We can continue to do what he wants and only  what he wants and only when he wants  to do it and only in the way he wants  to do it; or we can do what our Founding Fathers envisioned when they created  the Congress. We can exercise  checks and balances in order to try to  move policy into a more constructive  direction for this country.  If you oppose this bill today, and if  you take the position that all it should  contain  is what  the President  sent  down, then you would be saying that  you wanted to finance BRAC, the base-  closing program, by gutting key education programs as the President recommends. You would be opposed to additional  border  security,  additional  port security and additional cargo security.  You would be opposed  to  finally,  after all of the horrendous pictures and  all of the horrendous human suffering,  you would be opposed to finally meeting our total obligations to the victims  of Katrina.  You would be opposed to asking for  the money which the President himself  asked that we provide in 2005 on an  emergency basis to prepare this country to meet the pandemic flu epidemic  which will surely at some time come.  You would be opposing the additional  $3.5 million that we have provided in  this bill for veterans’ health care and  defense health care, and you would be  opposing the timelines and the benchmarks which we place in this legislation, not because they are so perfect,  but because they are the instrument by  which we communicate to the Iraqi  politicians that they must begin to resolve their differences, they must step  up, because we are not going to run our  baby-sitting service forever.

566,22,2007-03-23,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  acknowledge the extraordinary leadership of Mr. DAVIDOBEY, who understands that the strength of our country  is  indeed measured  in our military  might but also in the health and well-  being of the American people.  Thank you for bringing this important legislation to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, today is indeed an historic day. Today, this new Congress  will take the first step: it will vote to  end the war in Iraq.  Any statement on the war in Iraq  must  begin with  a  tribute  to  our  troops. Today and every day we thank  our troops for their courage, for their  patriotism, for the sacrifice that they  and their families are willing to make.  For 4 years and under the most demanding  and  dangerous  conditions  imaginable, they have worked together  to do everything that was asked of  them. As Members of Congress, our  first responsibility under the Constitution, the preamble to the Constitution  to which we take an oath of office, is to  provide for the common defense. We  here in this body have an obligation to  work together to do that for the American people.  Mr. JOHNSON,  our  colleague, you,  PATRICKMURPHY, and everyone in between who has served our country have  helped make it the home of the brave  and the land of the free. I salute you  both.  I would like to also acknowledge two  people who have been the champions of  our troops and experts on our national  security in this body. The two of them  are the leading proponents on the legislation that is on the floor today: the  Chair of  the Armed Services Committee, IKESKELTON; and the Chair of  the  Defense  Appropriations  Committee, JACKMURTHA. The two of them  care deeply about the well-being of our  troops, the readiness of our troops and  its importance to our national security, and they are proposing that we  pass this legislation today.  I have said from the beginning of this  war, this war is a grotesque mistake.  Last  year’s  bipartisan  Iraq  Study  Group said: ‘‘The situation in Iraq is  grave and deteriorating.’’ They called  for action.  The facts on the ground are these:  after 4 years, Iraq is in chaos and the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:42 Mar 24, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K23MR7.050 H23MRPT1 E S U O H h t i w 2 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2007
567,29,2007-03-23,Mr. TERRY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in strong  opposition to H.R. 1591, a pork-laden $124.3  billion war supplemental that would force U.S.  troops to withdraw from Iraq.  I strongly support benchmarks and high accountability for military and political progress in  Iraq, but not  in a manner  that hurts our  chances of accomplishing those goals. Under  this  legislation, U.S.  troops would be withdrawn from Iraq unless the President’s benchmarks for progress are met by July. This unreasonable requirement would not give General Petraeus enough time to show if the new  ‘‘troop surge’’ is effective.  In addition, this bill would force U.S. troops  to withdraw by August 2008  regardless of  whether the benchmarks are met. Members of  Congress should not be dictating strategy to  our generals in the field.  The authors of  this bill are  talking out of  both sides of  their mouths.  In attempting  to  reach a compromise,  they would  fund  the  troop surge while dooming it to failure by not  allowing enough time to see if it works. It is  clear that a forthright and honest vote on withdrawing U.S.  troops would  fail. The Majority  Party’s Leadership has instead chosen to entice Members of Congress with pork-barrel  spending in exchange for their vote on this bill.  The Washington Post  reported:  ‘‘House  Democratic leaders are offering billions in federal  funds  for  lawmakers’’ pet projects  large  and small to secure enough votes this week to  pass an Iraq funding bill that would end the  war next year.’’  This  so-called  ‘‘emergency’’ war  supplemental  includes non-defense spending such  as $283 million in milk subsidies, $474 million  in peanut subsidies, and $25 million in spinach  subsidies.  This legislation abandons the Majority Party’s supposed leadership on fiscal discipline. It  is a hypocritical and blatant attempt  to gain  votes from Members of Congress through special interest spending. The bill includes non-  military items such as an increase in the minimum wage,  tax relief  for small businesses,  drought aid, hurricane relief, agricultural subsidies and  funds  for child health  insurance.  Each of these items should be debated under  regular order in the House.  I  strongly  support  the  defense-related  spending  items  in  this  legislation,  including  critical equipment  for our  troops and health  care improvements for our veterans such as  funding for Walter Reed Army Medical Center.  I was also proud to sign the discharge petition  to vote on Congressman SAMJOHNSON’s legislation to ensure full funding of our troops.  We must demand meaningful progress  in  Iraq to curb sectarian violence, disarm militias,  train security forces and strengthen the arm of  the new Iraqi government until Iraq can govern  itself. However, H.R. 1591 is clearly not the  answer. Immediately withdrawing U.S. troops  would be an  irresponsible display of politics  that would endanger  future generations of  Americans.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting against this legislation, and to demand a  ‘‘clean’’ war  supplemental  that meets  the  needs of our troops without pork-barrel politics.  ",2007
568,29,2007-03-23,Mr. ETHERIDGE.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important legislation.  This supplemental appropriations bill contains vitally important funding for critical priorities and unmet needs. For example, this bill  includes $1.7 billion more than the President  requested  for military health care,  including  funds to correct the scandalous conditions at  Walter Reed and other military hospitals. It includes another $1.7 billion for veterans’ health  care, $2.5 billion for improving the readiness  of our stateside troops and $1.4 billion for military housing allowances. A nation at war simply must provide necessary funds to support  our troops.  In addition, this legislation includes $3.1 billion for military construction to implement the  BRAC mandates that impact Fort Bragg in my  Congressional District and military  communities all across the country. It is important to  note that the former Republican Congressional  Majority failed to pass the military construction  appropriations  and  imperiled  these  priority  projects. This legislation corrects that failure.  Mr. Speaker, the standards and benchmarks  in this legislation will assert some measure of  oversight and accountability  to a war policy  that has been tragically mismanaged by this  administration  for  too  long.  I have  resisted  supporting date certain language for troop redeployment because it is preferable that the  executive branch have the lead in foreign policy in partnership with the legislature. Unfortunately, this Administration has mistakenly interpreted that deference as a blank check for  its go-it-alone approach. No more.  The President’s speech this week calling for  ‘‘courage and resolve’’ demonstrated a continued state of denial. The American people do  not need more  lectures  from  this President  about resolve. Our troops do not need more  lectures about courage. What we need  is a  new  direction  to  rebuild  our military  and  refocus on the true threat to America from al  Qaeda and the Islamic jihadists who attacked  us on 9/11. We must deploy our military might  to Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere  to  eliminate Osama bin Laden and  the  true  ‘‘grave and gathering threat’’ to America.  We must pass  this  legislation  to send a  wake-up call to the President that ‘‘Stay The  Course’’ is no longer an option. Denial is no  longer an acceptable policy.  I urge my colleagues to support a new direction and vote  for this bill.  ",2007
569,29,2007-03-23,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Speaker, I will  vote for this Defense Supplemental appropriations bill.  Whatever some may say, I think it would be  grossly  irresponsible  to vote against  it. That  would be to vote against providing America’s  men and women  in uniform with  the equipment and  resources  they need and against  providing them the best health care they may  require when they come home.  I understand why some are urging a vote  against the bill. Many Americans are frustrated  and angry because we are four years into a  war the Bush Administration assured us would  be short and decisive. The Administration’s  misjudgments, lack of planning and poor leadership have made a bad situation worse. So  there are many who do not trust the Bush Administration to find a way to end this war, and  who believe Congress should simply act to cut  off additional funds.  But whatever may be said about the wisdom  of invading Iraq four years ago—and I am one  who believed it was a mistake to do so—the  fact is that we are still deeply engaged in Iraq.  We also must  finish  the  job of securing Afghanistan and defeating  the Taliban and al-  Qaeda. So long as our troops are in the field,  we must provide them what they need even  as we move to change the mistaken policies  of the Administration in Iraq.  This bill begins that change. It includes important  language  to hold  the president accountable to the benchmarks set by his own  administration and the Iraqi government.  Those benchmarks were outlined  in January, when President Bush announced that the  Iraqi government had agreed to pursue all extremists, Shiite and Sunni alike; to deliver Iraqi  Security Forces  to Baghdad  to  join  in  the  ‘‘surge’’; and to establish a strong militia disarmament program. President Bush also announced  that Prime Minister Maliki and his  government agreed  to pursue  reconciliation  initiatives, including enactment of a hydro-carbon  law; conducting of provincial and  local  elections; reform of current laws governing the  de-Baathification process; amendment of  the  Constitution of Iraq; and allocation of Iraqi revenues for reconstruction projects.  By holding the president and the Iraqi government  accountable  for  achieving  these  benchmarks,  this  bill will  provide General  Petraeus and the Administration with the leverage necessary to help the Iraqi government  forge a political solution. And we all know that  it will take a political solution—not a military  one—to end this war.  The bill is an important step toward what I  think must be our goal—a responsible end to  the war in Iraq, based on a strategy of phased  withdrawal of  troops, accelerated diplomacy  and redeployment that is based on Iraqi stability and not arbitrary deadlines.  It is true that this legislation includes a date  certain  for withdrawing U.S. combat  troops  from  Iraq.  I do not believe  this  language  is  wise and were  it up  to me,  this provision  would not be included in the bill. As a matter  of national security policy, we should steer  clear of arbitrary public deadlines and  focus  instead on realistic goals. Our military needs  flexibility to be able to link movements of U.S.  troops to the realities of the situation on the  ground.  The deadline established in this bill—August  of 2008—is far enough away that I believe we  may be able to revisit it if need be, and while  I find its inclusion troubling, I do not believe in  letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.  And the bill’s language does give the president flexibility to protect U.S. interests, since it  allows sufficient  troops  to  remain  to protect  U.S. military and civilians  in  Iraq, conduct  counterterrorism operations, and train Iraqi Security Forces.  The bill also protects our troops by limiting  deployment schedules and setting minimum  readiness standards—based on current Defense Department standards—for U.S. troops  deploying to the region.

570,36,2007-03-23,Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today in opposition to H.R. 1591. This is  not an Emergency War Supplemental; it is the  Partisan Repayment Act. Indeed, this legislation  is  less about supplying  the  troops  than  feeding the base.  There is desperate need for a new Iraq policy, and we should be using this opportunity to  have a serious discussion.  It  is unseemly,  even embarrassing, to use pork to buy support  for bad policy on a bill as important as this  one. It makes us look as trifling and greedy as  our enemies claim. The well-being of our men  and women in uniform is in the balance, as is  the future of the Middle East. If ever there was  a time to win on the strength of one’s ideas,  this is it.  I share the concerns of my colleagues regarding the progress of the war, and I believe  there  is value  in setting benchmarks. Ours  should not be an open-ended, unquestioning  commitment to the Iraqis. They do need to assume more responsibility for their own affairs.  It is not the job of our troops to referee partisan quarrels, nor is it our job to baby-sit the  Iraqi government.  It  is  foolish, however,  to make such milestones public. It is even more foolish to announce a date for withdrawal. Doing so gives  the enemy too much information and too many  options.  It is also foolish to codify deadlines. Who’s  to say  the  Iraqi government won’t make a  good faith effort to accomplish the tasks required of them? It would be wise to allow them  flexibility, not give them a drop-dead date. We  ourselves are working under a continuing resolution because we could not pass more than  two appropriations bills  last year. Our 5-day  workweeks are often 4 days  long—who are  we to set a deadline in statute?  There is a pressing need to formulate a new  policy for Iraq. I am disappointed the Democrats have yet to allow a serious debate on  this, the most important issue facing the Congress  today. Rather, we have wasted  time  with a non-binding  resolution  regarding  tactics—not even strategy. Now we send  the  Iraqis a laundry list of errands and a pre-determined result.  Success in Iraq will require a broad based  policy shift. The Iraq Study Group report includes 79 recommendations covering all facets of public policy—military, diplomatic, economic, and social. This report should form the  basis of a productive discussion. Unfortunately,  the Democratic  leadership has opted  for  a  hodge-podge  of  sound  bites  masquerading  as  serious  legislation. They  have stifled debate rather than encouraged it  by refusing to allow any amendments.  Mr. Speaker, this is but the first act in the  play. Our own servicemen and women do  need the funding this bill would provide. I am  confident once we get beyond this charade we  will be able to craft responsible legislation to  give it to them.  ",2007
571,36,2007-03-23,Mr. YARMUTH.," Mr. Speaker, we began this  week by solemnly marking the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq, the more than 3,200  brave soldiers who have been killed there, and  the 378 billion dollars that have been appropriated thus far. But we end the week with the  historic opportunity to bring about an end to  this catastrophe.  Over the last 4 years, the President not only  failed to provide a plan to win in Iraq, he failed  to offer our troops concrete and attainable objectives. Where he has  let down our  forces  and  the American people, Congress has a  Constitutional obligation  to step  in, and  this,  ‘‘The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans’ Health,  and Iraq Accountability Act,’’ is our chance. It  is our only real chance, to see this war end,  to comply with the stated will of the American  people, and to bring our troops home.  It  is  important  to  remember  that  this bill  does more  than  set  benchmarks  and  a  timeline; it also provides much needed funding  to protect our troops abroad and care for our  veterans at home. A vote against this bill is a  vote for the President but against our soldiers;  it supports the war but abandons our young  men and women in uniform.  That being said, whether we authorize it or  not, the President will find the funding to prolong this war, even if it is at the expense of  our soldiers, our veterans, and other crucial  programs. This country cannot afford another  Walter Reed, nor can  it afford  to send  the  to  indefinitely  President another blank check  extend this occupation.  The President has asked for a bill without  strings attached. He doesn’t deserve a bill  without strings.  In 4 years of acting without  strings,  this war has never had an end  in  sight. We have before us  today  the opportunity to bring finality into view, and I urge my  colleagues, members  of  the Senate,  and  President Bush not  to squander  this opportunity. I ask that we unite in support of Iraqi  independence, U.S. troops, and H.R. 1591.  Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker,  4 years that have been difficult for our country,  we have had to watch the administration bungle  the war  in  Iraq  in  just about every way  imaginable. As war became civil war in Iraq,  we watched our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle act as a rubber stamp for this misguided war while refusing to ask the pertinent  questions, the questions we were asking, the  questions the American people were asking.  And we watched as 3,200 of our brave troops  lost their lives in another country’s civil war,  while 24,000 came home with permanent injuries and billions upon billions of our taxpayers’  dollars have been sunk into the quicksand Iraq  has become.  This will be the case no more.  With  the scores of oversight hearings our  leadership has already conducted  this year  and now with this legislation, we are, for the  first time, bringing accountability, timelines and  end to the mismanaged war in Iraq.  Congress is no longer a rubber stamp.  The President has asked us time and again  for money  for  this war without any strings.  This, despite the fact that they let many of our  troops go to battle without the proper equipment, and that they can’t even account for $12  billion of taxpayer money for reconstruction.  With this bill, we will bring accountability as  well as money  for our  injured soldiers who  have been neglected. We are adding a total of  $3.4 billion for the military health care system,  including money to address the problems at  Walter Reed and money for head injuries and  post-traumatic stress disorder.  For 4 years,  the administration’s war policies have been risking lives and spending this  country’s treasure without any accountability.  This legislation will end the free ride and it  will end the war.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor.  ",2007
572,36,2007-03-23,Mr. COSTELLO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 1591, but with some reservations. While I appreciate the care with which  Speaker PELOSI, Chairman OBEY and  the  Democratic  leadership have approached  this  supplemental appropriations bill, we are  left,  as we often are, with a flawed product. But I  do believe, in regard to Iraq, that it is the best  we are able to do right now.  The legislation for the first time establishes  performance benchmarks for the Iraqi military  and government, and  firmly states  that  it  is  time to bring the troops home sooner rather  than later. I did not vote to authorize the Iraq  war, and  I do not support President Bush’s  troop surge, but if this bill does not pass we  will be forced to pass a funding bill that does  not have these benchmarks, and that would  be nothing more than the status quo, which is  a blank check for President Bush. I say again,  I do not support everything in this legislation,  but it is the best alternative available to us at  the present time.  I am particularly troubled by the non-military  and non-veteran spending in this bill.

What  is the gentleman’s sense on  when the work that was stopped in the  middle, right before a vote yesterday  on the D.C. bill, when will we see that  again?  ",2007
574,43,2007-03-23,Mr. HOYER., As soon as possible.  ,2007

576,43,2007-03-23,Mr. HOYER.," I don’t know that we  will see it next week, although I would  like to see it next week.  As the gentleman knows, I was very  concerned and remain concerned about  the  interpretation  of  germaneness.  And, frankly, that wouldn’t have been  a problem either had the minority been  willing to offer the traditional motion,  which was to recommit and have it immediately reported back to the floor. I  will tell my friend we would have had  a vote on that. I think you would have  probably  prevailed  on  the motion  itself, and we would have prevailed on  the bill. It would have carried that  rider with it, of course. But the minority,  frankly,  from  our  perspective,  chose to try to defeat the bill by not  just making the motion to recommit to  adopt the proposition that you offered,  but sending it back to committee for  that purpose, which was obviously not  necessary, which leads me to believe, I  want to tell you honestly, my friend,  that this was a procedural device to  kill the bill rather than let it come to  a vote on its merits.  As the gentleman knows, I feel very  strongly personally, others do as well,  but I feel very strongly personally that  we ought to extend a full voting franchise to the Representative who sits on  this floor and represents 600,000 of our  fellow Americans. The answer to your  question is, I hope to bring that to the  floor as soon as possible under conditions where we will protect ourselves  from procedurally losing a bill which  has the majority of votes on this floor.  ",2007
577,43,2007-03-23,Mr. BLUNT.," I thank my friend for  that response. On the issue of merit, I  suggest that the use of the procedural  availability to the minority wouldn’t  be nearly as necessary if this bill is  meritorious  and has  a majority  of  votes on the floor to actually have a  debate where the bill  is amendable,  where there are substitutes available,  where the other side of this debate has  an opportunity  to  truly offer other  ideas. And so far in this year we have  not really seen an openness on any bill  that was a bill that didn’t pass in the  last Congress on suspension to competition of real  ideas and debate.  I  think that is what we saw on that bill.  That is one of the reasons that that is  one of the few alternatives we had to  push back a bill that was not adequately debated, that has significant  constitutional questions. We look forward to the bill being on the  floor  again.  ",2007
578,43,2007-03-23,Mr. HOYER.," I appreciate the views.  Although, as  the gentleman knows,  that bill was reported out of the Government Reform Committee chaired by  a Republican, with a Republican majority, with a majority of Republicans  voting for the bill to report it out of  the committee in the last session. So  while I understand your view, it is not  as if we were taking up a bill that  hadn’t already been processed by your  committee  in the  last Congress, reported out of that committee, and because obviously there is opposition to  it on your side of the aisle, not brought  to the floor.  I understand the gentleman’s point;  but very frankly, the only reason it has  not passed, because it has the majority  of votes on this floor, was because the  motion that was made was not the traditional motion of adopting a proposition,  in this case the gun control  issue, and  reporting  it  immediately  back out with  that amendment attached.  I appreciate what the gentleman is  saying, but I can’t feel too guilty about  bringing to the floor a bill that was reported  out  of  a Republican-chaired  committee with a Republican majority.  ",2007
579,43,2007-03-23,Mr. BLUNT.," I appreciate my friend’s  sense of that. But I would also say that  if this bill has such broad support and  such  unquestioned  merit,  there  shouldn’t be any fear in having a full  and open debate where  the bill  is  amendable, where alternatives can be  proposed, and where the only opportunity to slow this process down would  not be to take advantage of the only  possible rule available to us under a  rule that was otherwise closed. That is  my view of that.  I thank my friend for his comments.  We look forward to the budget debate  next week.  f  ADJOURNMENT TO MONDAY,  MARCH 26, 2007  ",2007

584,43,2007-03-23,Mr. PEARCE.," Mr. Speaker, ever since  9/11,  law enforcement agencies have  been telling the American people they  should immediately report suspicious  activities. This important step is one  of the best ways we have to stop terrorism. Sadly,  last week, Americans  who were  simply  trying  to protect  themselves in their country have now  found themselves subject to a lawsuit  for reporting suspicious activity.  In a  lawsuit  filed against US Airways, 60 moms removed from planes in  Minneapolis have named ‘‘John Does’’  as defendants. These are simply people  who were watching suspicious activities and called to report those suspicious activities, and now they are  going to be terrorized in our court system in this country.  Mr. Speaker, I think that that is unconscionable, and so I am presenting  the Protecting Americans Fighting  Terrorism Act to keep people safe who  report suspicious activity in this country to law enforcement officials to protect the American people.  I urge my colleagues to support this  important measure to help us be able  to police ourselves and  report  suspicious activity.  f  SUPPLEMENTAL BILL PASSED  FOR PEANUTS  (Mr. KIRK asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

585,43,2007-03-23,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Speaker, today the  House passed a bill claiming to be the  U.S. Troop Readiness Act that included  billions in pork barrel spending unrelated to the needs of our troops. The  funding restrictions included in the bill  were so unpopular that the congressional leadership loaded a $25 million  bailout for spinach farmers, a $74 million payment for peanut storage, and a  $283 million subsidy for milk producers,  all to attract votes for the unpopular  bill.  As USA Today stated: ‘‘Votes were  won for peanuts, or to be more accurate,  for peanut subsidies.’’ The bill  also declares all of this spending, for  spinach, for milk and peanut subsidies,  as emergency wartime  supplemental  appropriations.

586,50,2007-03-23,Mr.  SMITH.," At any rate, we would  limit  that organ. But there are 28 organs  that we believe we can utilize in transplanting those organs from a hog into  a human being. We had success doing  that with anterior cruciate ligaments  and with heart valves. We can surely  do that with all the other organs.  And one of the most important is  skin  transplants. The  burn  victims  that we have, the burn victims coming  back from Iraq, to be able to give them  a new skin that is custom raised in the  feed lot in a sterile, sterile environment. And then the next step after that  is to match your identical DNA, Mr.  Speaker, so you can have your own  customized hog there that has got customized organs that are identical as if  they happened to have been your twin  brother.  We will get there with this science,  and it won’t be there very long from  now, 2 to 3 years on the first part of  this matching the DNA chains exactly  to take a sample. And raising those organs will happen within about, I am  going to say, 12 to 15 years. But those  are some of the things that we can do  with biotechs in both the plant and  animal science. And couple that with  the renewable fuels, couple that with  the  tremendous production  that we  have provided. At the same time, we  have more  soil conservation, better  water  conservation, more  fertilizer  conservation, better land management,  better processing and handling of our  manure, for example.  There is no better steward for the environment than the American farmer.  No one cares more about their water  quality. No one cares more about their  air quality. They live right in the middle of that every day, and they care  about their land. They want to hand  that along to the next generation and  the next generation. The best stewards  are the ones in charge, and they are in  Iowa, they are in Nebraska, they are  all across the Corn Belt, all across the  soybean area, and they go from coast  to coast with the specialty crop farmers.  This is a tremendous production system that we have in the United States,  with outstanding and impressive people  that commit their lives to feeding the  world. And we need to honor them  today on Ag Week here on the floor of  Congress. And I certainly appreciate  and respect the gentleman  from Nebraska for raising this issue and being  here tonight and for the opportunity to  say a few words.  ",2007
587,50,2007-03-23,Mr. SMITH of Nebraska.," I thank the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING). I appreciate the fact that you speak to the  future. As we look at so many of the  aspects of agriculture, I think sometimes we forget about the future and  how far we have come.  We have water  challenges  in Nebraska. And it is interesting, in the  middle of about a 7-year drought, I  don’t think enough credit is given to  the better practices that have been engaged in Nebraska relating to irrigation,  that  we  are  seeing  record  amounts of yields, record yields amidst  about 50 percent reduction in irrigation.  Now, there are also those critics out  there, they tend to be critical of the  fact that there aren’t return flows from  the former flowing of irrigation perhaps that many would consider waste.  But it is interesting that as farmers become more and more efficient, they are  also criticized along the way, and I  think that that is unfortunate. When  you talk about energy, it is absolutely  vital that we realize that, even amidst  corn prices that are strong, we have  unprecedented  costs of  inputs  especially related to energy, whether it is  the fertilizer or whether it is the diesel  for the tractor.  And that is what makes me nervous  about these urges to regulate industry  even more, that it will drive up the  cost. And not only electricity for the  consumer in their residence, but it will  drive up the cost of energy, as we see it  on farms and ranches. And that will  drive up the cost of food, plain and simple. And as I stated earlier, we have  come a long way in terms of producing  food in an affordable format.  I was reading through, and I noticed  part of the essay contest winner from  the Ag Council of America, and this is  the 2007 winner, LaTasha Cote, a 12th  grader  from Myrtle, Missouri Couch  High School. And students from 7th to  12th grade submitted original essays of  450 words about the importance of agriculture in the United States. Under the  theme,  ‘‘American  Agriculture  in  2025,’’  students were  encouraged  to  focus  their essays on  the potential  landscape of American agriculture in  2025 based on where we are today and  the opportunities that lie ahead. And  Ms. Cote read her essay to industry  representatives, Members of Congress,  Federal agency representatives, media  and others  in a celebration of agriculture; and let me share with you just  an excerpt:  ‘‘The alarm sounds off at about 8:00  a.m. A young man reaches over to turn  it off, gets up, jumps in the shower,  eats his breakfast, and then heads out  the door toward the milk barn. There  is no rush to get to the cows because  they have already been milked.  ‘‘He begins to check the computer  system to see the amount of milk produced from the third milking of the  day. Immediately, a very precise chart  pops up and gives the percentage of  milk given per second, the amount of  butter  fat, and accurately  tells  the  farmer the exact weight of the milk.  ‘‘Wait, where is the reality check?  Well, there isn’t one. This is only one  example of how far the industry in all  farms has come since the year of 2007.’’  And I haven’t had a chance to read  the entire piece, but I wanted to take  this opportunity to congratulate Ms.  Cote and every student who submitted  an essay in the contest. I think that it  may be even sooner than 2025 when we  see these things come about, but it is  great to see young people looking to  the future.  As we look at the big picture of agriculture, certainly globally we always  think of trade, and I think the unfortunate situation with the closure of our  beef, the rejection of our beef in many  cases to Asia, but it does I think send  a message to the larger issue of where  we are at with livestock in America. It  is interesting that we do find ourselves  with a bit of a shortage of grain to feed  our livestock.  b1415  And as we try to address this shortage, certainly, I think it can be best if  the government stays out of the way.  But when I hear concerns of this and  the  livestock  industry, perhaps, getting a little worried, it worries me, too,  because  the  livestock  industry  has  been absolutely crucial to economies of  rural America. And the fact that these  economies are not, I think, appreciated  like they should be, it is interesting to  note how further regulations of the recent past have led to many livestock  operations having  to become much,  much larger. And as they become much  larger, certainly, others become concerned about the livestock waste.  And it was encouraging to me last  year to finally see some understanding  that we don’t want policies that force  the producer to get larger. We want  them to have the options of getting  larger should they pursue that. Should  they feel comfortable with their current status, that is fine, too.  It is interesting, though, as we see  large operators, small operators, middle-size, medium-size  operators, we  have to realize that I believe our fundamental responsibility is to create opportunities. Government can create opportunities, not through a check necessarily, but we can create policy opportunities so that the little guy has  the option of getting larger and can  prosper  and  pursue  the  economic  dreams that they wish to.  And the gentleman from Iowa certainly pointed out the fact that there  are a lot of promising scenarios out  there. As I go across the Third District  of Nebraska  and  I  visit  operators,  whether they are small or large, it is so  encouraging to see people engaged in  the economy. And as they are engaged,  whether it is at a beef cattle processing  plant or a pork processing plant, or an  ethanol plant, or whether  they are  even creating biodiesel in their garage,  I think there is just tremendous opportunity, and that I believe it is my responsibility to maybe not protect that  opportunity, but to expand that and to  make sure that every producer, every  taxpayer has that opportunity to grow  and, hopefully, make a greater living,  and the government won’t take it all  away from them, and they can reapply  that  through available capital back  into the economy.

588,57,2007-03-23,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Mr. Speaker,  we have all worked very hard this week  to see the positive outcome of the legislation today.  As I started, I would like to close in  my comments today by saying that I  am glad that the Members voted in the  affirmative  for  this  legislation  that  passed. I think the American people  will reflect on this day, and historians  will reflect on this day that this has  been the first day by the House of Representatives since the start of the war  in Iraq that there were true accountability measures in there. There is reporting back to the Congress that the  troops were protected by the language  that the Department of Defense used as  relates to its own policy of deploying  troops, of sending troops back into theater on another rotation of what they  have to have. I think men and women  in uniform and their families will be  forever appreciative of our action here  today.  It is like when you are working at a  work site, not at headquarters, you are  working in a subsidiary, and you know  there are certain policies management  is supposed to meet, but because nobody is watching, they decide to waive  the policy manual and have you work  overtime without being paid overtime,  or have you working in conditions that  you should not be working in just to  keep their numbers up so they don’t  get in trouble with their bosses.  Well, with  the  emergency  supplemental that we passed here today, we  have the backs of those workers. In  this case, we have the backs of the men  and women who wear the uniform.  Furthermore, I think it is important  for those who have served in a battle  zone that we have started down the  track of making sure that we provide  the kind of funding so when they get  back, they will be able to get the counseling  that  they  deserve. There  is  money in here to prevent abuse as it  relates to children and families when  they get back to military bases, and  there is money to make sure that veterans don’t have to wait months to be  able to see a specialist. I think it is  very, very important because there is a  back end to this war, and there is a reality to this war, and it is our responsibility to ensure there is assistance to  those who need  it when they come  back.  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the  American people for the role that they  have played during  this whole war.  This week here at the Capitol we had  people that were supporting the war,  and against war but saying we have to  support our troops. And  I commend  both of them for exercising their rights  as Americans to be able to speak to  their government about their feelings.  I am glad that we live in a country  that you can do that.  I am glad that Members did come to  the floor. Some of them voted their  conscience, some voted partisanship,  and some voted because  it was the  right thing to do on behalf of this legislation.  As we move on with this process of  bringing accountability to the war in  Iraq and bringing an end to the war in  Iraq with troops on the ground, that  Members continue to pay attention to  what our democracy  is all about.  I  commend the Speaker for standing in  the wind, getting bugs in her teeth on  this issue and being tough on this issue  even when we were in the minority.  Now we are  in the majority, and  I  think the American people are going to  be very appreciative.  I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for hosting this hour today. It is always an honor to come to the floor and  talk about the actions of today and  look forward to tomorrow.  ",2007
589,57,2007-03-23,Ms. WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ.," We  have locked elbows for 12 years, Mr.  MEEK, worked together and fought together. As we close, I was thinking as  you were closing that you and I, we  were born 3 weeks apart. The Vietnam  war, when the Vietnam war was ending, we were less than 10 years old. We  were  little kids.  I don’t  remember  much about how  the Vietnam War  closed out, but that was the beginning  part of the history lessons that we had  in public school.  I remember  learning about, and  I  have read articles and read textbooks  and studied for exams learning about  what happened to our men and women  in uniform when they came back from  that war. As they came back, they  were spat upon and disrespected and  unappreciated. We see sadly the results  of that with so many of the homeless  and mentally disabled veterans that  scatter on our Mall and who stand up  for the rights of veterans.  I have to tell you, I am also proud of  the American people because as we  grew up, and as we spent the balance of  our lives until this point without there  being war, that is not how our troops  are treated any longer. The American  people grew, and they learned, and that  is what I am incredibly proud of.  I am proud that our colleagues today  did two things that are important: We  used our heads, and we listened with  our hearts, and we will be able to bring  our men and women in uniform home  from  this war. Until  then, we will  make sure that they have the funding  that they need, the equipment that  they deserve, and the plan to get them  home.  Mr. Speaker, the 30-Something Working Group is always proud to be able to  come to the floor at the pleasure of the  Speaker of the House and our leadership team. If anyone wants to contact  us or see any of the charts or see any  of the information that we have talked  about on the floor this afternoon, they  can  e-mail  us  at  30SomethingDems@mail.house.gov  or  visit  us  at  our  Web  site,  www.speaker.gov/30something.  f  OMISSION  FROM  THE  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD OF THURSDAY,  MARCH 22, 2007 AT PAGE H2954  f  CORRECTION  TO  THE  CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD  OF WEDNESDAY, MARCH  21,  2007 AT PAGE  H2760  ",2007
590,57,2007-03-23,Ms. WATERS., I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. TAYLOR)  for 2 minutes.  ,2007
591,57,2007-03-23,Mr. TAYLOR.," First let me tell the  gentleman from Georgia I appreciate  him  trying  to  save  some money.  I  think his efforts, though, are a year  late. If you want to look for Katrina  fraud, look for Katrina fraud that was  perpetrated by the Bush administration.  In south Mississippi we had 40,000  people at one point living in FEMA  trailers. We are grateful for every one  of them, but those trailers were delivered by a friend of the President, Riley  Bechtel, a major contributor to the  Bush administration. He got $16,000 to  haul a trailer the last 70 miles from  Purvis, Mississippi down to the gulf  coast, hook it up to a garden hose,  hook it up to a sewer tap and plug it in;  $16,000.  So the gentleman never came to the  floor once last year to talk about that  fraud.  But  now  little  towns  like  Waveland, Bay Saint Louis, Pas Christian, that have no tax base because  their  stores were  destroyed  in  the  storm, a county like Hancock County  where 90 percent of the residents lost  everything,  or  at  least  substantial  damage to their home, he wants to  punish Bay Saint Louis, he wants to  punish Waveland, he wants to punish  Pas Christian.  * * *  ANNOUNCEMENTBYTHEACTINGCHAIRMAN  The Acting CHAIRMAN.

594,64,2007-03-23,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, might I  say the Senator now has hurt my feelings. Would the Senator’s staff put up  the caveman chart? That now has hurt  my feelings. I don’t know how I am  going to be able to get through the day  after the caveman chart. I don’t think  that is even a good likeness of the Senator from North Dakota.  ",2007

The legislative clerk read as follows:  The Senator  from New Hampshire  [Mr.  GREGG] proposes an amendment numbered  622.  ",2007
599,64,2007-03-23,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President,  I ask  unanimous consent that further reading of  the amendment be dispensed  with.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment is as follows:  (Purpose: Point of order against using reconciliation to create new mandatory programs and 20% limitation on spending reconciliation)  SEC. . POINT OF ORDER—20% LIMIT ON NEW DIRECT  SPENDING  IN  RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION.  (a)(1) In the Senate, it shall not be in order  to consider any reconciliation bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, or any conference report on, or an amendment between  the Houses in relation to, a reconciliation  bill pursuant to section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, that produces an  increase in outlays, if—  (A) the effect of all the provisions in the  jurisdiction of any committee is to create  gross new direct spending that exceeds 20%  of the total savings instruction to the committee; or  (B) the effect of the adoption of an amendment would result in gross new direct spending that exceeds 20% of the total savings instruction to the committee.  (2)(A) A point of order under paragraph (1)  may be raised by a Senator as provided in  section 313( e) of the Congressional Budget  Act of 1974.  (B) Paragraph (1) may be waived or suspended only by an affirmative vote of three-  fifths of  the Members, duly  chosen and  sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of  the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and  sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal  of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order  raised under paragraph (1).  (C) If a point of order is sustained under  paragraph (1) against a conference report in  the Senate, the report shall be disposed of as  provided  in section 313(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.  ",2007
600,64,2007-03-23,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President,  I ask  unanimous consent that the amendment be accepted.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?  ",2007
601,64,2007-03-23,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I will  not object. This,  frankly,  is a complicated amendment. I am not sure I  fully understand all the implications or  ramifications of it, but the basic notion that we try to make certain that  reconciliation is used for deficit reduction is one I embrace and, in fact, one  that is in the budget resolution before  us.  We have a requirement in this budget  resolution that reconciliation only be  used for deficit reduction. The amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire is an attempt to send that signal  even more clearly, if I understand it  correctly, and the Senator can correct  me if I misinterpret it. That is my interpretation, and on that basis I would  accept the amendment.  ",2007
602,64,2007-03-23,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President, I say to  the Senator  from North Dakota the  purpose of this amendment is to make  it absolutely clear we do not make reconciliation a stalking-horse to spend  money. You have to use it to reduce  the deficit.  ",2007
603,64,2007-03-23,Mr. CONRAD.," Maybe we should explain what the term means. Reconciliation is a special process here in the  Senate that gets around the regular  order.  It creates a superhighway to  pass something. Reconciliation was designed and implemented to permit a  fast-track basis for reducing deficits.  Unfortunately, it can be abused and it  has been abused in the past and used to  actually  increase deficits. That was  never the intention.  We have prevented that from occurring in the budget resolution. So this is  an attempt to prevent something that  would have minimal deficit reduction  from being used as a stalking-horse for  a significant expansion of spending.  On that basis, I accept the amendment.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the amendment is adopted.  The amendment (No. 622) was agreed  to.  ",2007
604,64,2007-03-23,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President,  the  Senator from Arkansas has an amendment, but do we have an order that indicates on every amendment that there  be 2 minutes evenly divided and that  there be no second degrees?  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order provides that once voting begins, there is 2 minutes between  each amendment.  ",2007
605,64,2007-03-23,Mr. CONRAD.," And do we have an  agreement that there be no second degrees, but that we would reserve the  right, based on the managers’ decision,  to have side-by-sides in any case where  that is required? Do we have that as an  order?  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order is not for second degrees.  ",2007
606,64,2007-03-23,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, I ask  unanimous  consent  that both  those  provisions be in order, that we have 2  minutes of debate equally divided on a  vote, that there be no second degrees,  that at the discretion of the managers  there be the opportunity for side-by-  sides, and that we order rollcall votes  at this juncture on all those votes that  are presented.

607,71,2007-03-23,Mr. CONRAD.," Mr. President, there  have been a number of  statements  about the previous amendments that  are  factually wrong.  The  previous  amendment had a $5 million exemption  per person, plus a top effective rate of  35 percent. My colleagues on the other  side have misread the previous amendment. It had a top effective rate of 35  percent. I wanted to state that for the  RECORD.  The fundamental difference between  the two is that the previous amendment was paid for. This amendment, by  Senator KYL, whom I respect, is not  paid for. I would say to my colleagues,  if this is a priority, why not pay for it?  The hard reality is that if this amendment before us now is adopted—the Kyl  amendment—it blows a hole  in  the  budget, puts us back into deficit, after  we have worked so hard all these hours  to get a balanced budget by 2012. This  proposal would put us back into deficit  by over $15 billion in 2012. It would add  $35 billion to the deficit.  I urge my colleagues to reject this  amendment.  In  the previous Baucus  amendment, we provided for all of the  middle-class tax cuts and fundamental  and significant estate tax reform. It  was paid for. This amendment is not. It  ought to be rejected.  ",2007

611,71,2007-03-23,Mr. CONRAD.," The Senator is wrong.  I know why the Senator is reading it to  conclude that. My tax experts tell me  that the way the interactive effect occurs, the top effective rate  is never  more than 35 percent. I know why the  Senator is reaching that conclusion. I  would be glad to have my tax counsel  visit with him because they assure me  that in the previous amendment, the  top effective rate was 35 percent.  I  know the Senator agreed about the 5-  percent surcharge. I think time has expired.  ",2007

I want to make clear that while we believe the Nelson amendment had a top  effective rate of 35 percent, just looking at the amendment, one could easily  conclude that is not the case. So I want  to make that clear. In no way were we  denigrating Senator KYL’s honor with  respect to accurately and honestly depicting that amendment.  ",2007

631,78,2007-03-23,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. President, the  amendment the majority leader and I  are offering today is the first step in  our effort this Congress to undo a fundamental unfairness that affects over  300,000 disabled veterans in this country who also happen to be military retirees. In short, this amendment creates a reserve fund that will allow this  Congress to once and for all eliminate  the offset that exists between military  retiree pay and VA disability benefits.  At a time when we have men and  women in harm’s way in Iraq, Afghanistan and in other locations around the  globe, it is appropriate that the budget  resolution we pass out of the United  States Senate acknowledge and seriously address the unmet needs of our  Nation’s veterans.  It is wrong that our veterans are enduring  long waiting  lines to receive  health care from the VA due to inadequate funding. It is wrong that the  Bush  administration  slammed  the  doors of the VA health care system on  hundreds  of  thousands  of  so-called  ‘‘higher  income’’  veterans—veterans  who in reality make as little as $28,000  a year. And it is wrong for this administration to try to impose higher copayments and enrollment fees on our  veterans. As someone who sits on both  the Budget Committee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, I am incredibly proud that on all these issues, this  budget resolution is on the side of veterans and rejects administration proposals  that  short-change and nickel  and dime those who have served.  The scandal at Walter Reed has highlighted that even here in Washington,  only a short distance from this chamber, some of our servicemembers were  living in sub-standard conditions with  moldy walls, rodents, and holes in the  ceilings. Thankfully, this budget resolution also addresses this outrage.  In addition, this budget resolution  also provides for substantial, new investments in mental health services for  our veterans to help us treat the thousands of veterans returning from the  Iraq War with Post Traumatic Stress  Disorder, PTSD. Also this budget resolution recognizes that we need to significantly increase funding to treat the  large number of  servicemembers  returning with traumatic brain injury.  Finally, this budget resolution  includes an amendment I added in committee  that will allow us  to make  other important improvements to veterans’ programs  later  this year.  In  short, the budget resolution we are  considering is a huge step in the right  direction when it comes to veterans’  health  care and benefits. Chairman  CONRADand his staff deserve tremendous credit for recognizing the very serious needs of our veterans and moving  boldly to address them. I also want to  commend Chairman AKAKAof the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and his staff  for their work and support throughout  this budget process.  Even with  the  tremendous  strides  forward we have made for veterans in  this budget resolution there is one additional  issue  that needs  to be addressed. Today, Senator REIDand I are  offering this amendment to take care  of that very important issue. Before  getting into the details first let me  start off by saying that I am honored  to be working with the majority leader  on this issue. I know that, year after  year, he has been the leading voice in  the Senate to eliminate the Disabled  Veterans Tax. And today, he continues  that leadership with this amendment.  This amendment would create a reserve fund to allow for the elimination  of the remaining offset between military retiree pay and VA disability payments. In my view, this is an issue of  basic fairness. Military retirees earned  their retiree pay based on their long-  term service to the Nation. They earn  their VA disability benefits based on  the disability they acquire or aggravate in the service of their country.  The current offset between these separately-earned benefits originates from  a 19th century law that required a dollar-for-dollar offset of military retired  pay for VA disability compensation. In  my view and the view of millions of  veterans across the country, it is clear  that veterans deserve to receive both  their military retirement which they  receive for their service and their VA  disability payments as additional compensation  for  the  injuries and  lost  earning power due to their service-connected disabilities.  Let me provide just a bit of background on some of the progress Congress has made on this issue in recent  years, thanks in large part to the work  of Senator REID. In the fiscal year 2003  Department of Defense Authorization,  Congress  created  a  special  benefit  called  ‘‘combat-related  special  compensation’’ or CRSC. It expanded it in  the fiscal year 2004 DoD Authorization.  CRSC gives certain combat disabled  veterans a cash benefit equivalent to  what they would receive if full concurrent receipt were allowed.  In the fiscal year 2004 DoD Authorization bill, Congress approved phasing-in concurrent receipt for military  retirees rated as at least 50 percent disabled. The fiscal year 2005 DoD Authorization ended the phase in for 100 percent disabled veterans.  So, today we find ourselves in a situation where retirees who are less than  50 percent disabled are getting no relief  from the Disabled Veterans Tax and  veterans at least 50 percent disabled  but less than 100 percent disabled are  in the middle of the phase period that  will not be complete until 2014. Frankly, if Congress has made the determination that the ban on concurrent receipt  of military retiree pay and VA disability compensation is wrong—and I  think the legislation passed so far demonstrates that Congress has made that  determination—there is no excuse for  making veterans wait for the benefits  that we have acknowledged they are  due. Now  is the time—once and  for  all—we need to eliminate the disabled  veterans tax.  The Reid-Sanders amendment is just  one important step we need to take to  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:25 Sep 11, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\S23MR7.REC S23MR 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 4 2 C P D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2007

664,99,2007-03-23,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Mr. President, the  great untold story of the post–9/11 period is the recovery of America’s will  to move on, despite new threats, and  build an even stronger economy, an  even stronger America than before. We  gave the American people the tools  they needed to help themselves and  then we got out of the way.  We eliminated the marriage penalty  and doubled the child tax credit. We  created a tuition tax deduction. We increased  the deduction on charitable  gifts and put the death tax on the road  to extinction. We slashed the tax on  capital gains and dividends.  The American people took care of the  rest. They took all these things and  unleashed a flood of economic activity  that is still lifting the tide for tens of  millions of working families and retirees. We look out at the American economy today with amazement. Despite  9/11,  despite  a  recession,  despite  Katrina, despite a war, we see: 4.5 percent unemployment—lower  than  the  average of the last four decades. An  economy that is grown at 3.4 percent  over the last four quarters. More than  7.2 million new jobs since August ’03  That  is more  jobs over the  last 4  years than the European Union and  Japan—combined.  China may have the world’s fastest  growing economy. But its entire GDP  is less than the amount that ours has  grown in the last 51⁄2years.  New jobs create new revenue, and it’s  been pouring into the U.S. Treasury at  a staggering clip. Since we cut taxes on  capital gains, tax revenues exceeded  government estimates by more than  two-thirds.  President Bush looked out over this  economic landscape too, and he gave us  a budget that builds on it, that advocates discipline and anticipates continued strong revenues by keeping tax  cuts in place.  That is the formula for continuing to  shrink the deficit and leading us to a  surplus. And we had reason to think  the Democrats would embrace it, even  on taxes, when my good friend the senior Senator from Nevada said back in  November that raising taxes would be,  ‘‘Unacceptable.’’  Well, we should have known better.  Budget week is like an annual debutante ball for the Democrats. They step  out so everybody can take a good look  at them, but their budgets never look  good in the lights.  The budget they proposed this week  was a disaster. It restored the marriage  tax, cut the child credit in half, lowered deductions on everything  from  charitable gifts to college tuition, and  raised taxes on capital gains and dividends. It wasn’t just a tax increase. It  was the mother of all tax increases.  Nearly four times bigger than the previous record.  It reversed every tax cut we passed,  and its passage would have resulted in  a tax increase on every single taxpayer  in America.  A family of four with two kids and an  annual income of $56,300 would pay an  extra $2,000  Nearly  50 million married couples  would pay an extra $2,700 each year in  taxes.  More than 10 million single mothers  would see their tax bill go up by more  than $1,000.  Seventeen million seniors would see  their taxes go up by more than $2,000.  Spending wasn’t any better.  Here too, we thought the Democrats  might be coming around. The day before  the President’s budget was  released, my good friend, the Senior Senator from North Dakota, said:  We need to be tough on spending. The week  after that, he went even farther, saying we  should sharply inhibit the growth of spending.  But then the curtain fell, and we saw  the reality. The Democrats proposed to  increase nonessential spending over the  President’s budget by nearly $150 billion.  And as if that wasn’t enough, in addition to the tax hikes we could see, they  set up  20 new  accounts  that  they  planned to fill up with money they had  raised from a raft of new taxes they  didn’t even specify. Most of these funds  are for worthy purposes. But let’s be  honest with the American people and  pay for these programs by trimming  waste,  fraud,  and  abuse  instead  of  open-ended tax hikes down the road.  Republicans  opened  this Congress  with a pledge to work with Democrats.  We gave them a soaring economy and  an offer to take advantage of divided  government to do big things, as divided  governments have in the past. One of  the big things we proposed was entitlement reform. Every Member of this  Chamber knows Social Security  is  unsustainable in its current form. Yet  the budget writers ignored the problem  altogether. They proposed to raise $916  billion in new taxes—and to spend it.  Budget week  is when  the  rhetoric  meets reality: and one of the sad realities  this  budget  revealed was  that  Democrats weren’t serious about reform this week.  Oh they will deny it. Just like they  have tried to deny that the tax hikes in  this budget are tax hikes.  After I and my colleagues pointed  out the new taxes in this budget, the  senior Senator from North Dakota rose  to say that we were letting our imaginations get the better of us. He said  the Democratic budget contained ‘‘no  proposed tax increase.’’  But then, one day after rising on the  floor to insist that there were no new  taxes in this budget, he and his Democratic colleagues admitted as much.  They voted  for an amendment that  would reduce some of the more unsavory tax increases in their budget.  Well, you don’t need to be Einstein to  know that you can’t lower a tax increase that doesn’t exist.  The upshot of that amendment  is  that the budget we are now being asked  to vote on no longer represents a tax  hike four times larger than the previous record.  We are being asked to vote on a tax  hike nearly three times bigger than the  previous record—and, in the process, to  get in the way of an economic expansion, increase nonessential spending by  tens of billions of dollars, and do absolutely nothing about a pending entitlement crisis.  Republicans wouldn’t do any one of  those things, let alone all four. And we  urge our colleagues on other side to reconsider the damage they plan to inflict on Americans who have worked  hard  to  rebuild and  reenergize  this  country over the last 5 years.  Their current budget would squeeze  three-quarters of a trillion dollars out  of  the American  taxpayer without  shaving so much as a dime from a single government program. This is the  very definition of tax and spend. It represents a  tremendous missed opportunity. And it is a terrible disappointment.  When Republicans proposed  to accomplish big things, this isn’t what we  had in mind.  This budget is a big mistake. Republicans can’t support it.  ",2007

666,106,2007-03-23,Mr. THUNE.," Mr. President, today I  rise to honor the Madison High School  gymnastics team. On February 16, 2007,  the Lady Bulldogs won the South Dakota Class A State Gymnastics Title.  This  impressive  accomplishment  allowed the Lady Bulldogs to tie the national record of 13 consecutive championship wins. They currently share  the national record with Sehome High  School in Bellingham, WA, who set the  record from 1973 to 1985.  The Lady Bulldogs finished the season with an outstanding performance  at the South Dakota Class A State  Gymnastics Meet. With a final score of  141.893 points they not only tied the national  record  for  consecutive State  championships, but also set a South  Dakota Class A State record. These  two records highlight the talent and  dedication  that  has  characterized  Madison’s  gymnastics  team  for  the  past 13 years.  Head Coach Maridee Dossett  has  demonstrated her allegiance  to  the  Lady Bulldogs both as an athlete and a  coach. She was a senior on the team  that brought home the first State title  for  the Madison  gymnasts  in  1995.  Since that time, she has continued to  contribute to the success of the team  through  her  dedication  and  strong  leadership.  Leading Madison  to  victory was  Katie Finck in the uneven bars and  floor  exercise  categories, and Katie  Breuer in the balance beam, vault and  all around categories. Following the  example set by these two gymnasts,  the Lady Bulldogs illustrated their extraordinary teamwork and successfully  dominated each category of the competition.  I would like to take this opportunity  to honor and thank all those dedicated  to the Madison Central School District:  Head Coach Maridee Dossett, Assistant  Coach Kindra Norby, Athletic Director  Bud  Postma,  Principal  Sharon  Knowlton,  and  Superintendent  Dr.  Frank Palleria. The time and effort put  forth by these individuals have made it  possible for the Lady Bulldogs to be  one of the most successful gymnastics  teams of all time.  I would also  like to recognize the  gymnast’s parents  for  their  support  and devotion to the team. This great  honor was made possible by your encouragement and dedication to your  daughters and their teammates.  Most of all I would like to congratulate the women who won the State  championship this year and all the athletes who have been a part of this  record-tying streak. The gymnasts of  the 2006–2007 Lady Bulldog team, in alphabetical order, are as follows: Katie  Breuer, Kassie Finck, Theresa Knapp,  Katie Mackenzie, Heidi Mogck, Mara  Riedel, Sara Rogers, Kaitlyn Walker,  and Heather Williams.  These  student-athletes  should  be  very  proud  of  their  remarkable  achievements over the past years. The  inspiration of the gymnasts that began  this record success in 1995 has empowered those who have followed in their  footsteps and will continue to bring  motivation to Madison’s student-athletes in the future.  On behalf of the city of Madison and  the State  of South Dakota,  I  am  pleased to say congratulations Lady  Bulldogs on this  impressive national  accomplishment and keep up the great  work.∑  f  HONORING DEPAUW UNIVERSITY’S  WOMEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM  ∑",2007
667,106,2007-03-23,Mr. BAYH.," Mr. President, I wish to  pay tribute to the DePauw University  women’s basketball team for winning  the 2007 NCAA Division III National  Championship.  The  Tigers  defeated  Washington University in St. Louis on  Saturday at the ‘‘Birthplace of Basketball,’’  Springfield  College.  This  is  DePauw University’s  first  national  athletic championship and a proud moment for our State.  In being told of their victory, I was  reminded of what people  say about  teamwork, that at the end of the day  we are only as strong as the shoulders  we lean on. The talent of the Tigers  was apparent throughout their school  record 31–3 season, but it was their extraordinary  teamwork  that  brought  the  championship  trophy  back  to  Greencastle. These young women are a  testament  to what  student athletes  should be, and they should be commended for winning with class, courage, and character.  While the members of the team have  put in countless hours practicing and  developing their skills, the parents and  coaching staff dedicated should also be  recognized  for  their  role  supporting  and preparing the team. As a father of  two young  boys who  love  to  play  sports, I know how rewarding it can be  to watch my sons’ games. I also know  how dedicated parents must be to drive  their children to practice every day,  make it to the games, and cheer the  whole game through. It is this kind of  dedication that builds a support network worthy of a national championship.

680,134,2007-03-23,Mr. BURTON of Indiana.," Madam Speaker,  since the United States embarked on a mission to rid the world of terrorism, many of our  friends around the world have distanced themselves  from America, hoping  that will shield  them from the wrath the terrorists will one day  bring  to  their countries.  Indonesia has done  the opposite:  the government of  the country  home to the world’s largest population of Muslims has instead forged stronger ties with the  United States.  Recognizing Indonesia’s importance on the  global  stage,  its  government—first  under  Megawati  Soekarnoputri,  and  since  then,  under  the  leadership  of Susilo Bambang  Yudhoyono—has worked  closely with  the  United States  to  fight  terrorism,  and  the  spread of radical Islamism. This alliance has  come at no small cost to the Indonesians, as  terrorists have repeatedly punished Indonesia  by targeting hotels, nightclubs and other tourist attractions with deadly acts of  terrorism.  Nevertheless,  the government of  Indonesia  has not wavered in its commitment, and has  proven itself to be a great friend to the United  States.  As  Indonesia has  supported  the United  States in our Global War against Terrorism, it  is important that the United States continues  to support  Indonesia by recognizing  its sovereignty, and that it doesn’t intervene into Indonesia’s internal matters. The government of  Indonesia has proven itself to be more than  sufficiently mature and responsible to handle  its own internal issues, which relate only to Indonesians, and the United States should respect  its abilities. The government of  Indonesia has shown America that respect, and I  believe we owe it to them to do the same.  THE INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PENSION ADJUSTMENT EQUITY ACT  OF 2007  HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN  OFMARYLAND  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 22, 2007  ",2007
681,134,2007-03-23,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Madam Speaker, along  with my  colleague  from Pennsylvania, Mr.  PLATTS, I am proud to I introduce the Federal  Law Enforcement Pension Adjustment Equity  Act of 2007. I am also very pleased to have  other distinguished members of this body as  original cosponsors of this important bipartisan  legislation, including Mr. STUPAKof Michigan  and Ms. JOANNDAVIS, Mr. MORANand Ms.  DRAKEof Virginia.  Retirees of  the United States Park Police  and  the Secret Service Uniformed Division  who began  their careers before January 1,  1984, were promised  that, upon  retirement,  the would receive increases in their annuities  proportional to pay increases for active duty  servicfmen and women. However,  language  included  into  the 2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act specifically denied this promise to  this group of retirees as a cost-saving measure.  As a  consequence,  these  retirees have  been denied an annuity increase at great personal financial cost, even though they entered  federal uniformed service with  the promise  that these annuities would be there for them  upon retirement. This  is a gross  injustice  to  those who put their lives on the line every day  in service to their country.  That is why we are introducing the Federal  Law Enforcement Pension Adjustment Equity  Act of 2007,  to ensure  that Congress does  what is right, what is just and what is fair. This  legislation is bipartisan and should not be controversial.  It  is my hope  that  this body can  move this bill expeditiously through the legislative process and correct an injustice against  uniformed  federal personnel who have been  willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to serve  our country.  f  NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY  HON.

682,134,2007-03-23,Mr. SMITH of Nebraska.," Madam Speaker,  today is National Agriculture Day. National Agriculture Day occurs every year on  the  first  day of Spring. This is a week when we honor  agriculture  for providing safe, abundant and  affordable  products,  a  strong  economy,  a  source of renewable energy, and a world of  job opportunities.  It goes without saying that agriculture is tremendously important to my district and the nation as a whole, and I hope you join me in  celebrating everyone who works so hard  to  provide for the world.  The Third District of Nebraska is one of the  largest agricultural districts in the country. Our  district  ranks  first  in  the value of sales of  grains and oilseeds, second in total value of  agricultural products sold, and  first  in cattle  and calve inventory.  Simply put: Agriculture matters. National Agriculture Week is about celebrating the impact  the industry has on our State, our Nation, and  our everyday lives. I’m proud to represent the  Third District of Nebraska, a district that truly  embodies the spirit of this celebration.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE MAIL-IN-  BALLOT TRACKING ACT OF 2007  HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 22, 2007  ",2007
683,134,2007-03-23,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  introduce  the Mail-In Ballot  Tracking Act of 2007—a bill to implement procedures  for  tracking  the growing number of  ballots  in States  throughout  the country  that  are transmitted through the mail.  Although voters across  the Nation are  increasingly choosing  to cast  their ballots by  mail because it is more convenient and they  have more time to study their choices, many  voters have been hesitant to do so because,  quite frankly, they are worried that they cannot  determine for certain where their mail ballots  are in the system and whether they were actually received and counted.  In most cases, the fears of one’s mail-in ballot somehow being lost in the system are unfounded—but we all know  the  fear  is still  there. Our Nation’s voters deserve electoral  procedures  that are  transparent and which  strengthen their faith in democracy.  Sometimes  there  is reason  for concern.  I  have heard horror stories  from people who  simply did not receive a ballot they requested.  Other voters have called their overwhelmed  elections offices and waited on hold  for  too  long trying to find out whether their ballot has  been mailed or received. Even when they get  to speak with an  informed elections official,  that official often cannot tell the voter where  the ballot is because it is somewhere in the  postal system.  The good news  is  that  it  practical to track mail ballots.  We have been tracking the process of overnight packages for years by using the Internet  and the telephone. There is no reason why we  cannot track ballots using similar technology.  In  fact,  some  jurisdictions  such as San  Mateo County, CA are already tracking ballots  with great success.  The United States Postal Service  is currently introducing an ‘‘Intelligent Mail’’ system  which, if applied to election mail, will allow voters to find out via the Internet or the telephone  which postal processing  facility  last handled  their ballots and when  they were handled  there.  Quite simply, the technology will soon exist  to seamlessly track ballots from the time they  are sent out from the appropriate elections office to the time they are received back and include all the key postal points along the way.  Implementing ballot  tracking systems will  bring voters peace of mind and reduce  the  burden on elections offices which are often  barraged with phone calls from voters trying to  determine the status of their ballots.  This  legislation will also allow a voter  to  know whether his or her ballot passed  the  verification stage and will be counted.  Not only is mail ballot tracking feasible and  helpful, but it is also affordable.  is possible and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:34 Apr 19, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\RECORD07\E23MR7.REC E23MR7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

Johnson Community Service Award. This great honor has been bestowed upon Mr. Booker for his commendable  efforts to reduce teen automobile crashes in  my home state of Delaware as well as for his  dedication  to numerous other philanthropic  causes.  Julian, better known as Pete, created Delaware’s SMARTDRlVE program, which educates high school students about safe driving  techniques. Through  this program nearly a  dozen local agencies are partnered with more  than two dozen high schools in order to ensure young drivers are able to safely handle  the challenges of being behind the wheel. The  program has achieved great success and has  largely  impacted many people  in Delaware.  This success was recognized  in 2006 when  the program received a national safety award.  Pete is currently finishing his second three-  year term on the United Way of Delaware’s  Board of Directors, where he has volunteered  since 1994. His talents and tireless dedication  to such a worthy cause have facilitated and  enhanced much needed programs  in Delaware communities.  Pete  further demonstrates commitment  to  his community by volunteering a great deal of  time and resources to numerous other charities. The American Red Cross of  the Delmarva Peninsula, the Delaware Association of  Non-Profit Agencies, and Catholic Charities  are but a few causes he has volunteered to  assist.  Pete has also utilized his professional success  to  further  the many causes he champions. As the president and CEO of Delmarva  Broadcasting Company, he is able to donate  generous portions of air-time  to  campaign  thank-you ads as well as underwrite a portion  of United Way’s public events. The state of  Delaware is greatly indebted to Mr. Booker for  his selfless efforts. He has created a charitable  legacy  that has, and will continue  to,  touch many. I would like to congratulate Pete  for receiving the Wallace M. Johnson Community Service Award, I cannot think of a more  deserving recipient.

685,141,2007-03-23,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Madam Speaker, I am  honored to rise today and join the millions of  my fellow Americans in commemorating Greek  Independence Day which, on March 25th celebrates the 186th anniversary of the rebellion  and the struggle of the Greek people against  the Ottoman Empire.  Thomas  Jefferson  referred  to  ancient  Greece as the ‘‘light which led ourselves out  of Gothic darkness.’’ What makes Greek Independence Day so special here in America is  that it reminds us of the strong principles and  bonds  that  the U.S. and Greece share.  In  looking into the struggles of our two nations,  we realize how much our struggles have  in  common, and how much each country has  been influenced by the other.  Greece and the United States are bound by  an absolute commitment  to  the democratic  ideals of justice and freedom and continue to  be strong allies. By commemorating Greek  Independence Day, we also  celebrate  the  strength and the resolve of the human spirit  that has been the inspiration of us all.  On the occasion of the anniversary of Greek  independence, I join all Americans in wishing  the people of Greece congratulations and best  wishes. We will remain eternally grateful to the  Greek  people  and  the  legacy  of  ancient  Greece for the shining example it set for democracies the world over.  f  CHRISTIAN ANDRICK II FOR THE  AWARD OF EAGLE SCOUT  HON.

Christian has been  very active with his  troop, participating  in many scout activities.  Over the years Christian has been involved in  scouting and has held numerous  leadership  positions. He has served as Senior Patrol  Leader, Patrol Leader, and Troop Bugler.  Christian is in the Tribe of Mic-O-Say and in  the Order of the Arrow.  For his Eagle Scout project, Christian completed a landscaping beautifications project in  front of  the First Christian Church  in Blue  Springs, Missouri.

687,141,2007-03-23,Mr. BONNER.," Madam Speaker, the city of  Mobile, Alabama, and indeed the entire First  Congressional District,  recently  lost a dear  friend, a talented journalist and a lovely lady,  and I rise today to pay tribute to her memory.  Delores Freeny Mayes—or ‘‘Lowey’’ as she  was known to her many friends—was reared  in Mobile and graduated from Bishop Toolen  High School.  After working  for many years at Mobile’s  Brookley Field, Delores went on to write for  the Mobile Beacon, where she spent the past  25  years providing unique  insights  to her  many faithful readers.  Dubbed the ‘‘Helen Thomas’’ of the south  Alabama press  corps by my predecessor,  former Congressman Sonny Callahan, Delores  was always fair to those she interviewed and  covered. Although she was proud of her chosen profession, she was first—and foremost—  always a lady.  Over the years, Delores had the opportunity  to interview former President Ronald Reagan,  former Alabama Governor George C. Wallace,  Mississippi Senator TRENTLOTT, former Congressman Callahan, as well as his predecessor,  former Congressman Jack Edwards,  not to mention a host of other local, state and  national political figures.  While  she wrote about a wide-array of  issues affecting Mobile and south Alabama,  politics was never far from Delores’ mind, and  she was someone that public officials from all  walks of life knew they could trust.  In recent years, Delores turned her love for  writing into a celebration of her many other talents when she learned to draw and paint. I am  the proud beneficiary of a number of her original etchings and paintings, and at  this particular time when we are celebrating her life,  each one carries a special meaning to me.  Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues  join me  today  in  recognizing  this beloved  member of the Mobile community.  Delores Mayes will be deeply missed by her  sister, Jeanne Phillips; three brothers, Tommy  Cain, Hubert Cain, and  John Cain; many  nieces and nephews; as well as countless  friends she leaves behind.  Above all else, Delores was a devoted  daughter, sibling, wife and mother. Moreover,  she epitomized what a ‘‘true friend’’ really is.  Our thoughts and prayers are with her family during this difficult time.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF CHRISTINE  CARZO  HON. MICHAEL N.

689,148,2007-03-23,Mr. STUPAK.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to an extraordinary woman who  has made tremendous contributions to Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, to the County and City  of Marquette and to Northern Michigan University.  A Marquette native, Phyllis Maki is a graduate of Bishop Baraga High School. She has  spent nearly her entire life in Marquette and,  over the years, Ms. Maki has involved herself  in countless  local community organizations,  winning  the admiration of her  friends and  neighbors as someone upon whom her community could always depend.  Phyllis Maki is active on the Board of the  Lake Superior Community Partnership, which  fosters economic growth throughout Marquette  and surrounding, smaller communities. She  was Treasurer of the Lake Superior Community Partnership and Lake Superior Jobs Coalition. She  represented  the  interests of Marquette City by serving as a ‘‘Marquette County  Ambassador,’’ traveling to Lansing to advocate  for the community before the state House and  Senate and  to bring money back  from  the  state capital to invest in important programs in  the Marquette area. She further helped drive  economic growth in the area by serving on the  board of  the Economic Club of Marquette  County.  She has served on the boards of the Marquette County YMCA, the KI Sawyer Heritage  Museum and the Northern Michigan University  Centennial Committee. She has worked  towards access  to healthcare  for my constituents by serving on the Marquette Community  Access  to Health Care Finance Committee.  She has served as a member of  the U.S.  Olympic Education Committee and the Michigan  Department  of  Transportation  Focus  Group. As one of her  friends recently commented, ‘‘She is involved in everything!’’  She  has  been  recognized with multiple  awards  in  the past,  including  the Athena  Award in 1998, which recognizes excellence  of female leaders in their profession. She herself served  for several years on  the Athena  Board Steering Committee. She also received  the Paul Harris Fellow Award, an International  Rotary Award for assisting others in the community to reach their goals.  An honorary alumna of Northern Michigan  University (NMU), Ms. Maki’s ties to Northern  Michigan University run deep. She has served  many years on the Northern Michigan University Foundation Board of Trustees and as past  president of  this Board of Trustees  for 11  years. She was also a member of NMU’s  Golden Wildcat Club, Blue Line Club and a  member of NMU’s Forest Roberts Theater.  Ms. Maki can perhaps best be described as  ‘‘tireless.’’ In all areas of her life, Phyllis Maki  exhibits a tenacious, irrepressible spirit. While  her involvement in her community demanded  much of her time, she also made time for family: a single parent, she raised  two children  largely on her own.  She is known for waking early in the morning to tackle the day. She would start almost  every morning with a 4:30 a.m. run, finishing  in time to be in her office or in meetings as  early as 6 a.m. Her runs were so notoriously  early that one morning, she is said to have encountered a moose. She was up so early that  the only  living creatures up with her at  that  hour were wildlife!  While she has given freely of her personal  time and raised a family, Ms. Maki was also  able to lead a rich and rewarding career in the  private sector. In February of this year, she retired as the Chief Financial Officer of a local  car dealership. During her 37 years of work  there, she was the driving force in building the  company’s  philanthropic  activities,  encouraging them to regularly donate vehicles to various charities and non-profits. Coincidentally,  the name of her long time employer reflects  Ms. Maki’s altruistic spirit: the car dealership is  called Public Service Garage.  An active member of St. Peter’s Catholic  Church, Ms. Maki’s faith has always been a  strong foundation in her life, providing her the  spiritual endurance  to give so much  to so  many.  Tomorrow, Phyllis Maki will  receive  the  Northern Michigan University President’s Lifetime Achievement Award. This  prestigious  honor  is bestowed upon men and women  whose lives are truly outstanding. As the citation for this award reads, ‘‘A beautiful person  inside and out, she leads with strength and vision and lives with a kind heart and generous  soul. She is the best kind of friend—the forever kind.’’  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and the entire U.S. House of Representatives join me in  saluting my  friend, Ms. Phyllis Maki,  for her  lifetime of contributions and  in wishing her,  Carlo, Deborah, David and Michael all  the  best on this momentous occasion.  f  PUT  ASIDE  PARTISANSHIP  TO  PASS  COMPREHENSIVE  IMMIGRATION REFORM  HON.

690,148,2007-03-23,Ms. GIFFORDS.," Madam Speaker,  I am  pleased that we in the House of Representatives finally have a comprehensive immigration  reform bill that we can debate, and I am proud  to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation  authored by Congressman GUTIERREZ and  Congressman FLAKE.  Members in this chamber now have the opportunity to pass a bill that will secure the border and end our nation’s  illegal  immigration  crisis.  Given that the challenge of illegal immigration is complex, the solution must address all  aspects of this problem—border security, the  hiring of illegal immigrants, labor shortages in  certain sectors of our economy, and the millions of illegal immigrants currently living in the  United States.  A piecemeal approach will simply not work.  If we truly want to end illegal immigration, the  only option  is  to pass a comprehensive bill  that is tough, practical, and effective.  I stand here today ready to work with members of both parties, ready to listen to everyone’s concerns, and steadfast in my conviction  that,  if we can put aside partisanship and  compromise with each other, we can reach an  agreement.  In my district in southern Arizona, the need  for reform is critical. In 2006, 4,000 illegal immigrants a day crossed  the border  into Arizona. Our schools, hospitals, and law enforcement agencies are overwhelmed. Our environment and homeland security are threatened.  In the weeks ahead, I will be holding several  forums on this legislation in my district, so I  can receive  feedback  from  the  folks on  the  front lines of the immigration crisis. After listening  to a range of experts and  local residents,  I will  recommend possible  improvements before we vote on this bill.  f  WOODROW WILSON PRESIDENTIAL  LIBRARY  HON.

691,148,2007-03-23,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  today to introduce legislation that will establish  the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library  in  Staunton, Virginia.  In studying  the  life and  times of  the 28th President, we see how  Woodrow Wilson affected and continues to influence how the United States responds to national and international crises. This bill is identical to legislation that passed on the House  floor by Voice Vote  in  the 109th Congress  September 28, 2006.  As a statesman, scholar, and President,  Woodrow Wilson faced economic crisis, democratic decay, and a world war. Presidential historians agree that World War I, and President  Wilson’s leadership, radically altered the role  of diplomacy as a tool of foreign policy—a policy that established a new path for America’s  role in promoting democracies throughout the  world. So too did Wilson’s high-minded ideals  craft a legacy that shaped the powers and responsibilities of the executive branch in times  of war.  As a professor and president of Princeton  University, Wilson created a more selective  and accountable system for higher education.

And I want to salute you, Congresswoman KILPATRICK  and Congressman BOBBY for  your hard work, your diligent work in  putting forth a budget that we can all  be proud of. And also I want to thank  our staffs for their dedication and their  expertise in putting this together.  A budget is a road map that identifies and invests in the critical priorities of a Nation, and I am pleased to  say that this budget does exactly that.  For example, this budget takes the  very important step, and this is important, to address the waste, fraud and  abuse at the Department of Defense by  urging the  implementation of GAO’s  recommendations to the Department of  Defense. By incorporating just a fraction of GAO’s suggestions, DOD, for example, has saved over $52 billion over  the last few years. Imagine how much  more could be saved by fully implementing these recommendations which  are  included  in  the  Congressional  Black Caucus budget.  While addressing critical reforms at  the Defense Department, this will go a  long way also in shoring up our national security. I am pleased to say  that  this  budget  shows  an  understanding that really the Republicans  have never shown during their years in  power, namely, that domestic security  is national security.  This budget invests in our communities. It invests in our health care. It  invests in our future. It helps to lift  the 37 million people living in poverty  into a standard of living which each  and every American deserves, living in  the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world.  It puts $1.5 billion into HOPE VI, into  public housing and homeless assistance  programs. It allocates another $1.5 billion to the Community Development  Block Grants and brownfields redevelopment. These are all critical plus-ups  that strengthen and add value to our  communities and provide that national  security and economic security of our  people.  This balanced budget also adds over  $1.3 billion to the Ryan White CARE  Act and the Minority AIDS initiative,  and $10 billion into children’s health to  ensure that no child is without health  care in this country.  Madam Chairman, this takes a good  budget, our Democratic budget, and  makes  it  simply much better. This  budget is balanced. It is fair, it truly is  a moral  document, which  budgets  should be.  So, Madam Chair and Mr. SCOTT, I  want to thank you for giving our country really a moral document.  ",2007

695,24,2007-03-29,Ms. LEE.," Madam Chairman, first, I  would like to thank my friend and colleague, our co-Chair of the Progressive  Caucus, Congresswoman WOOLSEY, for  her  leadership on this  issue and so  many issues that relate to peace and  security.  Also to our executive director, Mr.  Goold, for all of your hard work and all  of our staff. You all have done a phenomenal job in putting this together.  As I said with regard to the Congressional Black Caucus budget, a budget is  a moral document. It defines what we  as a community, as a Nation, as a society hold as sacred. That is why I am  pleased that this Progressive Caucus  budget also is a reflection of our values  and our priorities.  There are several key elements  in  this budget I would like to focus on, especially five main items.  First, this budget will save up to $623  billion over the next 10 years by ending  the occupation of Iraq and bringing our  troops home starting at the end of the  year. The costs are simply untenable.  CRS estimates that we will have spent  over a half trillion dollars by the end of  fiscal 08 on this unnecessary occupation of Iraq. This rate of expenditure,  not to mention the cost in lives and  cost to our international stability and  credibility, is simply untenable.  Next, this budget takes steps at reducing our bloated military budget  without  compromising,  actually,  in  fact, it enhances our national security.  It accounts  for eliminating obsolete  Cold War era weapon systems and saves  $600 billion over the next 10 years.  Additionally, this budget would save  tens of billions of dollars over the next  10 years by implementing recommendations  by  the Government Accountability Office, which they have actually made, to eliminate waste, fraud  and abuse at the Department of Defense, which our taxpayers should not  allow to occur any longer.  This budget  increases  funding  for  critical components to help rebuild our  communities, including those ravaged  by Hurricane Katrina. For example,  our budget  increases  funding to the  Community Development Block Grants  to  $4.1 billion  in  2008, whereas  the  President has repeatedly targeted this  program for cuts.  This budget also  invests an additional $1.6 billion per year in section 8  housing vouchers to ensure decent and  affordable housing for all of those who  need housing assistance.  Fourth, this budget contributes to  our  national  security  interests  by  doing more to meet the growing humanitarian  needs  throughout  the  world, especially with regard to  increasing our contribution to the Global  Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis  and Malaria. We increased this by $100  billion.  Also, let’s just say our Nation’s security  is predicated on a  strong and  healthy  domestic  population.  It  is  critically  important  to  adequately  fund prevention and treatment of HIV/  AIDS in the United States.  The statistics, as it relates to HIV/  AIDS here in America, are staggering.  According to the Center  for Disease  Control and Prevention, racial and ethnic minorities represent 71 percent of  new AIDS  cases and  64 percent of  Americans living with HIV/AIDS. African Americans represent 50 percent of  new AIDS cases, although only 12 percent of our population. Latinos account for 19 percent of new AIDS cases,  although 14 percent of the population.  I urge our colleagues to support this  budget. It clearly is a budget that is  fiscally responsible and is a moral document.  ",2007

697,24,2007-03-29,Mr. HERGER.," Madam Chair, I rise in  strong opposition to the alternative  budget before us now and the Democrat  budget. The Democrat majority party  seems intent on raising taxes and increasing spending. American families,  seniors, and small businesses would all  experience major tax hikes. Virtually  no American would be spared.  The budget before us ignores the benefits of the tax relief passed since 2001.  This tax relief has spurred economic  growth and created literally millions  of new jobs. Meanwhile, tax revenue to  the Federal Treasury is surging, helping to reduce the deficit. Their budget  also ignores the out-of-control growth  in entitlement spending. This is deeply  irresponsible. The tax-tax/spend-spend  philosophy  supported by my  friends  across the aisle is bad economics and  bad  for  the American people. Vote  ‘‘no.’’  ",2007
698,24,2007-03-29,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Chair, I yield  21⁄2minutes  to  the gentleman  from  California, the Chair of the Veterans’  Committee, BOBFILNER.  ",2007
699,24,2007-03-29,Mr. FILNER.," I thank the gentlelady,  and  I  thank  the  leadership of Ms.  WOOLSEYand Ms. LEEof the Progressive Caucus.  Madam Chair, I rise this morning as  the Chair of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee in proud support of  the Progressive Caucus budget.  Other budgets  fund  the war;  this  budget funds the warrior. I am going to  repeat that: Other budgets  fund the  war; this budget funds the warrior.  Most of us in the Progressive Caucus  are against the war in Iraq, but we are  united  in our view that when these  young men and women come home and  all the other young men and women  who came home in the past, that they  get all the care, the support, the honor,  the dignity, the love that a grateful  Nation can bestow.  We are united in saying we will honor  those who come home. They have done  everything we have asked, they have  been brave and courageous, they have  had incredible wounds both physically  and mentally, and we are going to give  them the care, love, respect, and honor  that they deserve.  This  is the only budget before us  today that says we will have what is  called  ‘‘mandatory  funding’’ of veterans health care. Mandatory funding  means we don’t have to wait 5 months  like the Republicans did last year when  they didn’t fund the Veterans Administration for the first 5 months of the fiscal year. Assured funding, mandatory  funding, means that they will be funded on the first day of the fiscal year,  and they will get automatic funding  that doesn’t have to go through a political fight.  We have a President that says support the troops, support the troops,  support the troops. The speakers on  the other side say support the troops,  support the troops, support the troops.  But when they get home, who is supporting them? Who is supporting these  brave young men and women when  they come back? We saw what happened at Walter Reed. We saw what  happened to Bob Woodruff when he had  traumatic brain injury—and those who  were less fortunate than he didn’t get  the treatment they needed. We heard  about the young marine who went to a  Minnesota  hospital  saying  he  had  PTSD and was thinking about committing suicide, and they said he was number 28 on the waiting list, come back in  a month. He went home and he committed suicide. That is not a Veterans  Administration, that is not a country  that is welcoming its troops home. It is  time that we fund the warrior and not  just the war. Vote for the Progressive  Caucus budget.  ",2007

701,24,2007-03-29,Mr. WELDON of Florida.," I thank the  gentleman  for yielding,  and  I  rise  today in opposition to the Progressive  Caucus budget.  This debate today could be described  as a debate about the good, the bad,  and the ugly. A kinder way you could  describe it is the responsible, the irresponsible, and the reckless.  We are going to have the House Republican budget brought  forward on  this floor today, brought forward by  our chairman, Mr. RYAN, a responsible  budget, a good budget, a budget that  comes to balance in 5 years without  raising taxes and tries to address the  challenge that we face in the category  of entitlements.  We have  the Democrat  leadership  budget that is going to be brought forward, a budget that has the biggest tax  increase in our Nation’s history, and a  budget, I might add, that not only includes significant increases in spending, but as well makes no effort to deal  with the challenge of entitlements.

703,45,2007-03-29,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Mr. Chair, I  yield myself 10 seconds, as I yield to  our minority leader, simply to say the  gentleman from Maryland comes from  a State which under their budget will  see an average household tax increase  of $3,238 per household. This will affect  2,259,000 Maryland taxpayers.  At this time, Mr. Chairman, I would  like to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Missouri, the  minority whip (Mr. BLUNT).  ",2007
704,45,2007-03-29,Mr. BLUNT.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I’m confident that my  3 minutes will go quicker than my good  friend’s 1 minute just did.  I don’t hardly know how to respond  to what I just heard on the floor from  my good friend from Maryland. Whenever we had budget chairmen in those  years when we balanced the budget, apparently there is no credit given for  that. Mr. Kasich did draft a budget  that balanced; certainly Mr. Nussle  did; certainly there was a precedent.  And I agree with my friend when he  said 9/11 did have an impact. 9/11 did  have an impact. The defense cost after  9/11 had an impact. The cost after 9/11  of homeland security had an impact.  The flat economy coming out of 2000  had an impact and our tax policies had  an impact. In fact, in 2005, the largest  increase in revenue in the history of  the Federal Government, 14.5 percent  in 2005, because our tax policies worked  and produced more than a shallow recovery.  Permanent tax cuts? We would like  to see permanent tax cuts, but, as my  good  friend and others know, unless  you have 60 people on the other side of  the building in the 100-Member Senate,  you can’t have permanent tax cuts.  We have extended these tax cuts in a  way that has extended our economy,  extended our growth,  increased our  global competition in the marketplace.  Mr. RYAN’s alternative continues to do  those things. The overall budget that  we are talking about today as the underlying budget doesn’t do that.  Our friends on the other side, in fact,  my very good  friend  from Maryland  just said that they aren’t increasing  taxes, they are just letting current tax  policies expire. When you make the  same  income and your taxes go up,  that explanation rings pretty hollow.  Your taxes increase as this budget anticipates they would.  And  then  they  say  that many of  these tax increases don’t occur until  the third year of this budget, so you’re  not going to see an immediate tax increase. But of course you’re going to  see  an  immediate  increase  in  the  spending of the money that those new  tax revenues provide. Those tax  increases do happen to start for some  American families as early as the 1st of  January, next year.  Take, for example, the line in the  Tax Code allowing many of our Nation’s veterans and warfighters to collect the earned income tax credit. This  budget anticipates that when that expires on December 31, 2007, it does not  come back as part of the Tax Code, and  the money that is produced by that tax  increase is part of what this budget  spends.  The majority’s budget  renews  the  death tax. The majority’s budget renews  the marriage penalty  that we  have eliminated, and 48 million couples  in 2011 would pay $2,900 more every  year in Washington taxes than they did  the year before.  For that and many other reasons, Mr.  Chairman, I urge that we stick with  the policies that have grown our economy, that let us compete, that appreciate families and support this alternative.

706,45,2007-03-29,Mr. EMANUEL.," Mr. Chairman,  I  would like to thank the minority whip  for his comments.  And, yes, in the nineties we did balance the budget. I would just remind  him, and  I don’t want to start my  speech this way, but the first budget  you proposed led to a government shutdown. It was President Clinton that led  the way to a balanced budget and a  surplus.  Now I want to thank you. Some of  my colleagues have criticized you. I  want to thank you. I want to thank  you because to govern is to choose. We  have two clear choices here, and there  is no doubt about it. President Kennedy  once  said,  ‘‘to  govern  is  to  choose.’’  We’re offering a new direction. You  are offering the status quo. There is no  doubt about it. Because you have given  us, and nobody has really quite said  thank you enough to your $4 trillion of  new debt, and you need to be appreciated for it. Because, as I’ve always  said, if there is one thing you can say  about George Bush and  the Republicans when it comes to the economy,  we will forever be in your debt. And  that is the one thing that is absolutely  clear about your stewardship with this  economy.  Four trillion dollars, the largest accumulation of debt in the shortest period of time in American history. Don’t  look at your shoes when I’m saying it  now, because you know that is your  legacy.  Now, what are the priorities and the  differences?  In Medicaid and Medicare, let’s just  take a look at health care, number one  economic issue for the American people. You cut $250 billion for Medicare  and Medicaid. Democrats double the  size of the children’s health care program  in  this country. Two choices:  Status quo, a new direction.  You cut $5 billion from college assistance  for people who are  trying  to  achieve the American dream. We expand college assistance by $3.5 billion.  You have made a decision to make  cuts in other areas like agriculture. We  make sure that our farmers have a future where their children can inherit  the farm and have a future in rural  America.  The choices are clear. We have a balanced budget that is balanced with our  priorities. You maintain an economic  strategy that adds to the Nation’s debt  as you have in past years.  Every year of our budget, the deficit  declines. Every year under our budget,  5 years in a row, the budget deficit declines until  it  reaches balance and  eventually a surplus. Every year. You  achieve your goals by cutting $250 billion from health care assistance, Medicare and Medicaid.  POINTOFORDER  ",2007

711,52,2007-03-29,Ms. DEGETTE.," Mr. Chairman,  strong support of H. Con. Res. 99.  For the last 6 years we have been swimming in serious red ink. Deep red ink. Thanks  to President Bush and  the Republicans  in  Congress we have added almost three trillion  dollars to our Nation’s debt. This red ink also  seemed  to be without end.  In  the past  the  other side of the aisle put forward budgets that  did not reflect a serious commitment  to responsible  fiscal policy. Those budgets also  failed to reflect the priorities of the American  people.  Well, Mr. Chairman, Congress is under new  management. That new management has produced a budget  for  the House  to consider  about which  the American people can be  proud.  The Democratic budget  is  fiscally responsible.  It  reimposes pay-as-you-go  (PAYGO)  budgeting principles and achieves balance in  2012. At the same time, this budget puts our  priorities in the proper order.  For example, it provides tax relief to those  who it needs it most—the middle-class. This  tax relief includes the extension of certain tax  breaks, such as the child tax credit, and reform of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).  This budget also increases spending on the  things that matter most to the American people, such as our children, education, health  care, and veterans. Today we will be providing  for a $50 billion increase in funds to provide  health insurance to millions of more uninsured  kids. Education, training, and related programs  will receive three billion more than current levels and almost eight billion more  than  requested by  the President. Funding  for veterans’ health care services  is  increased by  14.4 percent.  I am proud to support this budget. It reflects  a responsible fiscal position and puts our limited resources towards programs and policies  that are important to this nation. I encourage  all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H. Con.  Res. 99.  ",2007
712,52,2007-03-29,Mr. SALI.," Mr. Chairman, today Members of  Congress  faced  two budget resolutions. The  choice is a clear one between bigger, more  expensive  and more  intrusive  government  versus fiscal discipline based on key priorities.  Now, fiscal discipline is hard, which is why  it is not always popular. It is easy for some to  vote to increase government spending, but ultimately someone must pay for it. It is common  to hear about  the  ‘‘government’’ doing  this project or that project. We hear a lot about  the  ‘‘government’’ spending money, but we  must not allow the idea of ‘‘government’’ doing  something to lead us to forget that, ultimately,  ‘‘We the People’’ are the ones who have to  pay for what government does. The nineteenth  century economist Frederic Bastiat once said  that ‘‘government is the great fiction through  which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.’’  Although  the Federal Government  is not  known for its fiscal discipline, we are now facing a budget that exceeds even the most fevered  imaginings of history’s biggest spenders. It would enact the largest tax increase in  history—an almost $400 billion increase.  This  is one path, and  it  is  the one down  which the new Majority proposes to take us.  We also had the opportunity to take another  path, a roadway to a balanced budget without  raising taxes on working Americans.  The choice is clear. The Democratic budget  would do serious harm to Idahoans, their families and  their businesses. The Democratic  budget would: Raise  taxes on 436,000  Idahoans who benefit from the current 10 percent  tax bracket; force 176,000 married couples in  Idaho to pay for an increase in the marriage  tax penalty; force 133,000 Idahoans with children to pay higher taxes because of the expiration of the current child tax credit; and raise  tax rates on capital gains and dividends  for  74,000 Idaho investors, including Idaho senior  citizens.  The Democrats are demanding  that hardworking Idahoans further subsidize the already  bulging government coffers. More  than  that,  the reckless increases in entitlement spending  included in their bill would require that generations to come pay for our present unwillingness to make tough decisions.  As many know but few heed, the explosive  rate of entitlement spending is simply not sustainable. If the current rate of federal entitlement spending remains unabated, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will consume  20 percent of the Nation’s economy annually  by 2040. If trends continue, entitlements will  take up over 60 percent of the entire Federal  budget in less than a decade. Our Nation is  one of great prosperity, but no nation can expect to maintain economic and political greatness by feeding government programs at the  expense of working families.  Few will  be  untouched  by  this  vicious  money-grab. Seniors, married couples, parents,  small business owners,  lower-income  earners—all will be forced to turn over more of  their earnings to the Federal Government.  In contrast, I support the Republican-offered  substitute  budget.  The Republican  budget  reaches a balanced budget by 2012, but retains the important tax cuts adopted in 2001  and 2003. The Republican budget does not  arbitrarily raise the 10 percent bracket to 15  percent;  it preserves  the current 10 percent  rate. Lower-income earners need that money  more than the government does. The Republican budget: Stops raiding the Social Security  surplus; reins-in unsustainable, runaway entitlement spending by slowing the rate of annual  entitlement spending growth,  thereby saving  money for the taxpayers; prepares for the future by budgeting  in advance  for national  emergencies and crises; refines and strengthens the so-called ‘‘pay as you go’’ (PAYGO)  rules to require that spending increases be offset with spending  reductions  instead of  increasing  taxes; caps discretionary spending  through  2010  so Congress  cannot  simply  throw more money at problems  that require  real solutions.  In short, we in Congress are accountable to  our constituents. We must remember that real  people and their livelihoods are at stake back  home. If we wish to help those back in our  districts, we must bear in mind that we do not  have all  the answers here  in Washington.  Congress did not earn the money that we took  in taxes. It was hard-working Americans that  earned it. If we fail to make the direly-needed  tough choices about  runaway spending, we  are merely fostering a tax-and-spend culture  that demands our constituents make pay a  greater sacrifice in their earnings.  This is an unacceptable demand to make.  Thankfully,  the President has said he would  veto the Democratic bill. Yet unless Congress  begins to take seriously the need for economic  growth,  tax  reduction  for  families and balancing the Federal budget, relying on the nation’s Chief Executive to exercise his veto pen  is like depending on a child to put his finger  in the leak of a dyke. It will only work for a  short time. We’ve got to do better, soon.  ",2007
713,52,2007-03-29,Mr. ORTIZ.," Mr. Chairman, Federal budgets  reflect our values as a nation. This Nation has  rejected passing the monumental debt run up  by this administration and past congresses on  to their children. We are bringing a new fiscal  direction to our budgeting process.  Correcting the fiscal course of the country  will not be easy, or fast. We did it before, but  success only comes with  the hard work of  passing budget and appropriations bills every  year . . . unlike the way past Congresses did  it: not paying the bills, running up huge waves  of debt in the form of higher taxes on our children. We’re about to start doing this right.  Our fiscal outlook deteriorated dramatically  over the past 6 years. In 2001, the administration inherited a projected 10-year (2002–2011)  budget surplus of $5.6 trillion. After paying for  tax cuts for the richest among us, that surplus  was gone. Between that and the 9–11 attacks,  the United States accumulated a mountain of  debt, adding $2.8 trillion to our Federal debt  burden since 2001. Most of this debt has been  purchased by  foreign  investors, making  the  U.S. economy more vulnerable  to economic  and political  instability and political pressure  from abroad.  Deficits matter. It is our moral responsibility  to start cleaning up the fiscal chaos wrought  by the last Congresses and the President. Living beyond our means comes at a cost to our  children and grandchildren who will have  to  pay off that debt. The irresponsible economic  policies of the past 6 years have left a debt  burden of $29,075 for a typical middle-income  family of four in Texas.  Deficits also hurt economic growth by slowing down national savings, which  leaves us  less to invest in our future. That means lower  productivity and wages for future workers. The  President’s budget continued  the  fiscal approach that has brought us large deficits and  growing debt.  This budget is in sharp contrast to the trend  of spending our children’s money  like mad.  Today’s budget takes the necessary steps to  eliminate our long-term budget deficit by adhering to the pay-as-you-go principle, just as  families at kitchen tables do every day across  the country.  A balanced budget must  include balanced  priorities. For the first time in 6 years, the congressional budget resolution will balance the  Federal budget—in 2012—while also defending our country, delivering critical services to  children and families, caring for our veterans,  educating our children, and growing the U.S.  economy.  The 2008 budget is the blueprint for the new  direction we are taking the American people.  It provides greater deficit reduction  than  the  administration in the first 5 years, leading to a  budget surplus in 2012 . . . we pay for the  budget as we go, not as we hope we’ll have  a windfall of money . . .

No funds made available under this Act  shall be used to make payments to growers  and first handlers, as defined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, of  fresh spinach that were unable to market  spinach crops as a result of the Food and  Drug Administration Public Health Advisory  issued on September 14, 2006.

737,94,2007-03-29,Mr. DEMINT.," Mr. President, my  amendment  simply  states  that  no  funds in this act shall be used to make  payments to spinach producers.

Last week, the Senate spoke  unanimously and we voted to block  this spending from our budget process  last year.  I am asking all my colleagues to support the removal of this  wasteful spending  in this emergency  war supplemental bill.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.  ",2007

I was there throughout the  entire committee markup. There was  never any money for spinach in the  Senate version of this bill. There is not  now any money for spinach in the Senate version of this bill, so adoption of  this amendment will not change the  substance of this bill one iota. But if  the Senator insists, we will go ahead  and move forward on his amendment.  We are happy to take it by a voice vote  if the Senator would consider that.  ",2007

742,143,2007-03-29,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, the  Senate has just made a tremendous effort in moving forward to make sure  we support our troops in every sense of  the word. I thank all of my colleagues  who voted ‘‘aye’’ in moving this forward.  It  is  important to remember that  this is an emergency supplemental bill.  I have heard others on the other side  call it a war supplemental. It is true,  indeed, that over the last several years,  the President has insisted that we pay  for the war in Iraq on an emergency  supplemental. But I remind everyone  that there are countless emergencies  across this country, and we, as Democrats, believe it is critical that we address those concerns—whether it is our  agricultural industry, which has faced  drought, severe weather, family farms  which have been inundated and unable  to continue to provide the crops all of  us rely on to feed our families; whether  it is our veterans who, as the occupant  of the chair well knows as a member of  the Veterans’ Committee, have been  left behind time and time again.  We all know of the Walter Reed issue  that hit the papers several weeks ago.  But this is not a new issue for many of  us who have been following this issue  for  some  time. We have men  and  women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  who are coming home and have severe  traumatic brain  injuries. They have  been lost in the system. We are now  starting the fifth year of this war, and  to date this President has not planned  and supported funding to make sure  those men and women—whether it is  traumatic brain injury or whether they  lost a limb or whether they have post-  traumatic stress syndrome or whether  it is just coming home and being able  to find another job—have been paid attention to.  In this supplemental, we say we are  going to pay for all costs of the war  and certainly pay for those men and  women who paid the ultimate price,  along with their families, and taking  care of them is part of that cost of war.  In this critical bill which the Democrats voted for, we make sure they are  a part of this.  So we provide funding to repair the  facilities at Walter Reed and also to  make sure that across the country the  Walter Reed syndrome is paid attention to. Those veterans facilities we  have gotten the reports from—the 1,100  sightings of mold on the walls, of bats  that have not been gotten rid of in the  Oregon VA facility, of peeling paint on  the walls—these kinds of conditions  are not ones we as Americans should  allow to continue.  In the supplemental bill, we say we  are going to take care of those issues,  and we require specifically that the VA  come back to us in 60 days and identify  every one of those 1,100 sightings and  say whether they have fixed those facilities. If they have not, we want to  know the exact cost, because we are  not going to let those men and women  sit in those deplorable conditions.  Under this bill, we address the issue  that has faced many of our soldiers  who have returned home with traumatic brain injury. Many of us saw the  Bob Woodruff  special  several weeks  ago, a reporter who was in Iraq and  who suffered a traumatic brain injury.  We saw how he struggled with his recovery and now has presented an amazing news story to let all of us know  what is happening not just with him  but to men and women across this  country as they come home. It is true  when a soldier is in a vehicle that is  immediately affected by a blast, they  often know they have traumatic brain  injury. It is also true soldiers who may  be 100 or 150 yards away from that blast  may also receive an injury but may not  know it.  We have all talked to these men and  women when we go home, and their  wives normally say to us, my husband  can’t remember where he put a piece of  paper I just handed to him, not realizing he had been a victim of a blast  and that his injury had caused brain  damage. We need to make sure those  soldiers are treated and are treated  well, and that we have the research and  the capability to make sure they are  not lost when they come home from  service to this country. That funding is  in this bill, and that funding was voted  on by a majority of Senators in this  body. We are going to keep working to  make sure it is there.  We also have in this bill money for  Katrina. It seems a long time ago now  that our country was stunned by the  impact of Katrina and other hurricanes  in the gulf coast. Americans across the  country said, what are we going to do?  We know since that time there have  been major stumbles. As Democrats,  we are not stepping back. We believe  that is as much an emergency as what  the President has asked  for  in this  emergency supplemental focusing only  on Iraq, the war, and the reconstruction efforts there.  We have a reconstruction effort that  is absolutely critical here in this country. Democrats are standing up and  saying we are going to take responsibility and pay for it. There is $6.7 billion in here for the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. I believe that is as much a critical emergency spending item as the reconstruction dollars the President has asked for  in the supplemental, and that is why  we are supporting this bill.  This bill also addresses the issue of  homeland security. We have heard a lot  of rhetoric about homeland security  and protecting our own. That  is an  emergency because that  funding has  not been there. Rhetoric protects no  one here at home. We provide $2 billion, critical infrastructure dollars, for  port security, mass transit security,  and explosive detection equipment at  our airports. We are putting it into  this bill because it has not yet been  funded, and across this country Americans are at risk without that funding.  We have heard a lot of talk on this  floor over the last several days about  extra  porkbarrel  spending. Well,  I  would say to all of my colleagues there  is  $4.2 billion  that  is provided  for  Americans here at home—not for reconstruction efforts out in the world  but for right here at home, $4.2 billion.  Senator BOXER from California was  out here yesterday showing tremendous pictures of the agricultural disasters that have occurred in California.  These are farmers whom we rely on as  Americans when we go to our grocery  stores to be able to buy food to feed our  families. If their farms are lost because  they do not have the support after a  disaster that has affected them, every  one of us suffers. As Democrats, we say  that is as much an emergency as what  we are putting into this bill for reconstruction in Iraq. We need to reconstruct here at home.  On this side we are playing catchup.  For a number of years now we have  seen  emergency  supplementals  that  were just war supplementals. We are  saying that, as Democrats, we know we  have to invest in ourselves across the  country. We have to invest in our future. We will only be as strong abroad  as we are at home. If we abandon our  farmers, if we abandon our children because they do not have health care—  and there  is SCHIP  funding  in this  bill—if we abandon our gulf coast residents, who have not yet been able to  rebuild their homes and their  infrastructure, if we abandon our veterans  when they come home and don’t take  care of them, if we abandon our military  personnel without  the  proper  equipment and supplies, then we are  not doing the job we have been sent  here to do.  We are proud of this supplemental we  are putting forward because, in addition to everything else, we are taking a  major step forward and saying we are  no longer going to idly stand by without  any  debate, without  any  consequences, and move continuously to  increase the war in Iraq. We have said  it is time for us as a nation to tell the  Iraqi people they need to stand up for  themselves. That language is critical  in this bill.  We have worked with colleagues on  all sides to put together what I think is  a very important, very critical bill for  us here in America—here at home. We  are going to work very hard now in  conference with our House colleagues  to come together with a bill to bring  back to the Senate and then to send to  the President.

745,150,2007-03-29,Mr. REED.," Madam President,  the  emergency appropriations bill passed  by the Senate this morning is urgently  needed for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, for our wounded veterans,  and for scores of Americans facing natural disasters on the homefront.  I commend Chairman BYRDand Senator COCHRAN for their hard work and  close  collaboration. As  the  acting  chairman of the Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee, I also wish to thank  Senator HUTCHISONand her able staff,  along with my committee staff, for the  help they gave in crafting the portions  of the supplemental which dealt with  military construction and veterans affairs.  The total for military construction  and veterans affairs  in  this  supplemental is $6.548 billion. It includes in  title I $1.644 billion for military construction. Also contained in this section is a proviso restricting the obligation of $280 million until the Secretary  of Defense certifies that none of the  funds will be used for the purpose of establishing  permanent U.S. military  bases in Iraq. I think that is an important point to clarify.  Title II of the recommendation includes a total of $4.9 billion for military construction and also for activities at the Department of Veterans Affairs. This includes $3.137 billion to restore funding for BRAC, which is very  important to reset our forces as they  are returned from overseas and to help  reconfigure all of the services. This  fully funds the request of the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2007 for  this account and will keep the BRAC  process on track.  Because the costs of the war are not  associated strictly with activities on  the battlefield,  the  recommendation  includes $1.767 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs.  In crafting the VA portion of this  bill, we targeted the funding specifically for purposes of building capacity  to deal with the influx of OEF and OIF  veterans, hiring  claims adjudicators  and leveraging technology to expedite  benefit claims, and upgrading existing  VA facilities.  The VA health care system is one of  the best in the world. It has specialties  in a number of areas, including spinal  cord  injury and blind rehabilitation.  Because of these specialties, the VA  has become a great resource for the  treatment of troops wounded in Iraq  and Afghanistan. However, due to the  nature of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, coupled with the advances in battlefield medicine, both the DOD health  care system and the VA health care  system are treating more military personnel with  complex  and multiple  wounds  and  particularly  traumatic  brain injuries.  In response to this, in 2005, the Congress provided funding to the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish  polytrauma centers. The funding contained in this bill builds on the success  of these centers by providing a total of  over $163 million in polytrauma care  for services ranging from establishing  more  level  1  comprehensive  polytrauma  centers  to  creating  polytrauma residential transition rehabilitation programs, to upgrading the  entire polytrauma network system.  The bill also adds $150 million for enhancements  to  readjustment  counseling, substance abuse programs, and  mental  health  treatment  capacity.  These are specialty areas that the VA  will need to continue to expand to deal  with readjustment  issues  facing veterans returning from the war zone. In  order to begin making progress toward  deficiencies identified by the VA’s facilities condition assessment and  to  prevent a possible Walter Reed Building 18 situation, the recommendation  includes $550 million in nonrecurring  maintenance and $356 million in minor  construction.  In addition to  funding provided to  the Department, the supplemental also  includes a general provision directing  the National Academy of Public Administration  to  conduct  an  independent analysis of the management,  structure, and processes that are  in  place at the VA with regard to providing health care to active duty and  veterans of the wars  in Afghanistan  and Iraq, as well as providing benefits  to veterans of  these conflicts. This  study will assist the VA and Congress  in identifying the cumbersome bureaucratic redtape that far too many of our  soldiers go through in their transition  to the VA.  The bill also includes a provision requiring the Congressional Budget Office to conduct a budget study of the  current and  future  long-term budget  impacts of OEF and OIF on the Department of Veterans Affairs. We know  with a number of these young men and  women who have been  severely  injured—many with brain  injuries and  likely lifespans of 50 or 60 more years—  that we will have to provide long-term,  consistent, robust funding. We should  identify that number now and provide  that continuing support for the next  several decades.  This supplemental marks the continuing high priority the Senate places  on ensuring that yesterday’s, today’s,  and tomorrow’s soldiers are cared for  in the highest manner once they have  done their duty and once they have  come home to America.  Let me make one other point. I was  somewhat disappointed in this bill because I was attempting to include an  amendment to rehabilitate a levee system in Woonsocket, RI, to ensure it is  up to Federal standards.  This amendment would have provided  $3.25 million for the city of Woonsocket  to rehabilitate the levee, including replacing  important  gate  cables. The  present cables are about 40 years old.  According to the Army Corps of Engineers, failure of a cable during operation could result in an uncontrolled  discharge  downstream  of  the  dam.  Woonsocket is an old industrial city,  densely populated, and  these  levees  protect that city.  The Woonsocket project was built between December 1963 and April 1967 by  the Army Corps of Engineers. The  Corps estimates that cumulative flood  control benefits  for  the Blackstone  Valley project are more than $82 million. This project in place protects at  least $82 million worth of property.  Given the importance of this flood  protection to Woonsocket and communities on the Blackstone River, I believe Federal assistance is warranted  to protect life and property.  These deficiencies were discovered as  a direct result of Katrina. We learned  in Katrina there were projects, levees  that were unsatisfactory. They failed  and they caused billions of dollars of  damages. Being forewarned—I hope we  are  forewarned—that having  studied  these problems,  I hope we can now  come together in Congress to provide  the resources and help these local communities, many of which do not have  the resources to sustain this kind of  immediate and rapid expenditure.  A recent assessment by the Corps  found that the Woonsocket levee and  dam is in need of repairs. The Corps  has given the city until February 2008  to make these repairs, otherwise the  project will no longer be eligible for  Federal construction funding through  the Army Corps of Engineers.  In addition, if these repairs are not  made, the Federal Emergency Management Agency could, and likely will, determine the levee no longer offers adequate  flood protection and could require residents to buy flood insurance,  which is a very expensive proposition.  The city of Woonsocket  is economically distressed. It needs Federal assistance. There are other communities  around the country that might be in a  similar situation.  The devastation wrought by Katrina  in New Orleans shows us what could  happen. Now we have the knowledge—  the foreknowledge—and now we have  to act. I am disappointed we did not  act in this situation to protect this  complex of levees.  I will continue to bring this issue to  the attention of my colleagues again  and again because I believe that with  this knowledge, action  is  required—  prompt, appropriate action—to ensure  this community is protected.  I wish to make a final point because  my colleague has been very patient and  very considerate in allowing me to go  ahead.

753,157,2007-03-29,Ms. STABENOW.," Mr. President,  I  rise today to urge the Bush administration to look beyond the next 48 hours.  Right now, in Seoul, Korea, U.S. negotiators  are meeting  nonstop  with  South Korean officials to finish up the  so-called Korean Free Trade Agreement. They are rushing because if they  don’t finish it by Saturday night at  midnight, the trade agreement would  not be eligible for fast-track authority.  My colleagues understand what that  means. They would not be eligible to  move it through in a way that would  not allow us to change the agreement  in any way but puts it on fast-track authority so that if many of us believe  there are concerns with it, we would  not have the full range of options that  we normally do in the Senate to be  able to correct it or object to it.  Mr. President, these negotiators are  not discussing some minor trade deal.  They are debating what could be the  largest U.S.  trade  agreement  since  NAFTA,  the North American Free  Trade Agreement.  I urge the White  House and its negotiators to look beyond the final hours left on the fast-  track clock. What happens in the next  48 hours could affect  the American  economy, American  businesses,  the  American auto industry, and American  workers for decades to come. The goal  is not to race to the finish line. The  goal should be to have the very best  possible  trade  agreement—an  agreement that raises the standards of living for everybody by creating a level  playing field, an agreement that ensures market access  for both countries—not just South Korea.  This cannot be a one-way deal. It has  to be an opening of markets for both  American businesses, American agriculture, as well as South Korean agriculture and business, and so on, including the  industry that has built the  middle class of this country, which is  the U.S. auto industry.  There seems to be an agreement that  upholds the value of what has made  this country successful. Fair competition, competition that rewards hard  work, deserves our attention, and it is  based very simply on what we happen  to think in Michigan is just plain common sense, having the rules be the  same.  It  is pretty simple, but even  though they are basic, right now there  is a question as to whether they will be  included in this rush to this final trade  agreement, to beat the clock.  We don’t need an agreement that  sells out American workers or pits  American companies against  foreign  governments that cheat the system. In  this rush to the finish line, this administration has failed to remember that  there is an alternative. This Congress  will pass good trade agreements without fast track. We have done it before.  I have  supported good  trade agreements. I want to vote for good trade  agreements. We want to export our  products, not our  jobs. That  is  fundamentally what is at stake in this negotiation that is going on right this  minute.  I believe we must be a key player in  the global economy. We are a key player, and trade agreements are part of  that role. In fact, the old argument of  protectionism versus free trade doesn’t  fit  anymore. When you Blackberry  your phone, the Internet can jump any  wall that could be put up. There is a  fundamental question  for us  today:  How are we going to compete in a global economy and keep the middle class  of this country, keep our way of life in  this country? That is what is at stake  in the negotiations going on right now.  Unfortunately,  fast-track authority  has been used in the past to pass bad  agreements through Congress. We undermine the integrity of our trade policy if the administration’s agreements  sell out our workers or export our middle class.  Sadly, this administration makes it  even worse by not enforcing our trade  laws. We all know about what is happening when other countries, such as  China or Japan, manipulate their currency—or, in some cases, even South  Korea. We all know what happens when  there are counterfeit products brought  into this country and our ideas and  patents are stolen, when other countries don’t follow the rules. We need to  make sure the rules are working and  they are being enforced right now as  we look to expand any agreements.  We are talking about the next 48  hours. Simply put, racing to the finish  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:31 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S29MR7.REC S29MR7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007

757,164,2007-03-29,Ms. CANTWELL.," Mr. President,  I  rise this evening to talk about House  bill H.R. 137, which has a companion  Senate bill, S. 261, the Animal Fighting  Prohibition Enforcement Act. This is  legislation that both the House and  Senate have had much discussion on in  the last several years, and something I  hope will make its way to the consent  calendar and final action this evening.  I come to the floor tonight as someone who has been a cosponsor of this  legislation for several years now, and  as someone who has seen the impact of  animal fighting in the state of Washington where animal fighting organizations have not only been a source of all  sorts of cruel and inhumane treatment  of animals, but also other illegal activity. To me this is legislation that is  much needed, and we have passed similar legislation in the State of Washington. It is something we should have  a strong Federal statute on.  During October of 2004, there was a  major raid in Vancouver, WA, where  police found 21 pit bulls, as well as  training logs and other evidence of animal fighting. It got quite a bit of attention as well because there were very  high-profile people involved with the  animal fighting ring.  There is a long list of other incidents  that  have  happened  in Washington  State, other activity in Yakima, WA,  where various animal fighting organizations were discovered by law enforcement who have done a terrific job of  uprooting these organizations  in our  State. It is important we take an aggressive stance and pass this legislation.  The House bill we are talking about,  H.R. 137, recently passed the House of  Representatives, I believe with over 300  cosponsors. I am sure it had quite a few  others who actually supported the legislation as it passed. We have over 35  cosponsors here with S. 261.  When I look at the legislative history  of  this bill,  it has had  remarkably  broad bipartisan support. It was passed  by both the House and the Senate in  the past. It was passed in both Chambers in 2001 and then struck in the conference report. It passed in 2003 in the  Senate. It passed in 2005 again in the  Senate, a unanimous measure. As  I  mentioned, it passed the House of Representatives. I think it is fitting that it  should be on our consent calendar and  hopefully pass this body this evening.  The bottom line is, there are many  organizations across the country that  have seen the inhumane treatment of  animals and have supported this legislation. The American Veterinary Medical Association supports the bill, obviously. The National Sheriffs Association supports this  legislation. Police  departments  have  been working  in  every part of the country and have endorsed this legislation because they see  what kind of criminal activity is associated with animal fighting—gambling,  drugs, and in one case in Washington  State  actual murder.  The  Federal  antianimal fighting legislation is important. While we already have a Federal statute on the books, what we  don’t have is a Federal statute that effectively helps law enforcement meet  this growing challenge. That is, with a  simple misdemeanor, which  is  currently on  the Federal books,  sometimes  it  takes  law  enforcement as  many as 7 to 8 months to investigate  these kinds of crimes. To investigate  and put that kind of energy into fighting this kind of criminal activity in  our States, and then to have a maximum penalty of only up to 1 year is  not adequate.  In fact, in Washington State, in response to the activities that occurred  in Vancouver and other parts of our  State,  our  Governor  signed  an  antianimal fighting bill that has been a  great model  for what we should be  doing at the Federal level. As Washington did, this bill would make sure  this crime is a felony and that it has  adequate penalties. In fact, when the  current Federal animal  fighting  law  was enacted  in 1976, only one State  made it a felony. Today dogfighting is  a felony in 48 States. We need to make  sure that it is also a felony at the Federal level for transporting these animals and products associated with animal fighting across State lines. In fact,  we are seeing that in many cases.  In Washington State and in Oregon,  we have seen this activity, because  people in several States are joining together to locate and to make a profit  and make investments in these kinds  of criminal activities.  We want to make sure we are stamping out this activity. With this legislation, we believe we have a very good  chance to say that the Federal Government views this kind of animal fighting as cruel and inhumane, that we  consider it a serious criminal activity  to drug and force animals to fight and  then to enclose them in pits while spectators engage in all sorts of gambling,  narcotics  trafficking,  public  corruption, and, in some cases, even violence  toward people. That is something we  ought to take a tough stance against.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation. I hope we can consider it in  tonight’s consent calendar, given how  the Judiciary Committee has supported  this legislation, and how it has passed  both the House and Senate in the past.  f  EASTER  ",2007
758,164,2007-03-29,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, the poet  Alfred  Edward  Housman,  1859–1936,  wrote  in his  poem,  ‘‘A Shropshire  Lad,’’ the following verse:  Loveliest of trees, the cherry now  Is hung with bloom along the bough,  And stands about the woodland ride  Wearing white for Eastertide.  The trees are  in bloom.  In Washington, the annual cherry blossom festival begins this Saturday, March 31,  and runs through April 15. It is always  a beautiful sight, whether viewed under  warm and sunny skies or as the blossoms fall like rain on a misty morning.  It is a lovely celebration of Spring and  a welcome complement to Easter.  This year Easter  falls on April 8,  when the Senate will not be in session.  Each year, of course, Easter falls on a  different day, sometimes with many  weeks’ difference from year to year.  Easter is a very moveable feast and has  been throughout its long history. The  calculation of when to celebrate Easter  has varied through the centuries, being  settled for just over 1,427 years by the  Council of Nicea in 325 A.D. But even  today, Easter  remains  a moveable  feast.  The Roman Emperor  Constantine  convoked the Council of Nicea in 325  A.D. to resolve a number of important  differences between the religious practices across his empire. The council decided that the Easter festival should be  celebrated on the  first Sunday after  the  full moon  following  the vernal  equinox, thus eternally linking the return of spring with the resurrection of  Christ.

759,185,2007-03-29,Mr. CORNYN.," Mr. President, I rise to  introduce the Workforce Health  Improvement Program Act of 2007, otherwise known as the WHIP Act. This bipartisan bill I introduce today is the  same  legislation I  introduced  in the  109th Congress. I am very pleased to be  joined again by my good friend and colleague,  Senator  HARKIN, who  shares my  commitment  to  helping  keep America fit.  Public health experts unanimously  agree that people who maintain active  and healthy lifestyles dramatically reduce their risk of contracting chronic  diseases. And as the government works  to reign in the high cost of health care,  it is worth talking about what we all  TOM can do to help ourselves. As you know,  prevention is key, and exercise is a primary component in the prevention of  many adverse health conditions that  can arise over one’s lifetime. A physically fit population helps to decrease  health-care costs, reduce governmental  spending, reduce illnesses, and improve  worker productivity.  According to the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC), the economic cost alone to businesses in the  form of health insurance and absenteeism is more that $15 billion. Additionally, Medicare and Medicaid programs  currently spend $84 billion annually on  five major chronic diseases: diabetes,  heart disease, depression, cancer, and  arthritis.  Reports also show that only about 15  percent  of  adults  perform  the  recommended amount of physical activity, and 40 percent of adults do not participate in any physical activity. With  physical inactivity being a key contributing factor to overweight and obesity, and adversely affecting workforce  productivity, we quite simply need to  do more to help employers encourage  exercise.  Given the tremendous benefits exercise provides, I believe Congress has a  duty to create as many incentives as  possible  to  get Americans  off  the  couch, up, and moving.  With this in mind, I am introducing  the WHIP Act.  Current  law already permits businesses to deduct the cost of on-site  workout facilities, which are provided  for the benefit of employees on a pre-  tax basis. But if a business wants or  needs to outsource these health benefits, they and/or their employees are  required to bear the full cost. In other  words, employees who receive off-site  fitness center subsidies are required to  pay income tax on the benefits, and  their employers bear the associated administrative costs of complying with  the IRS rules.  The WHIP Act would correct this inequity in the tax code to the benefit of  many smaller businesses and their employees. Specifically, it would provide  an employer’s right to deduct up to  $900 of the cost of providing health club  benefits off-site for their employees. In  addition, the employer’s contribution  to the cost of the health club  fees  would not be taxable income for employees creating an incentive for more  employers to contribute to the health  and welfare of their employees.  The WHIP Act is an important step  in  reversing  the  largely preventable  health crisis that our country is facing,  through the promotion of physical activity and disease prevention. It is a  critical component of America’s health  care policy: prevention. It will improve  our nation’s quality of  life by promoting  physical  activity  and  preventing disease. Additionally,  it will  help  relieve pressure on a  strained  health care system and correct an inequity in the current tax code.  I ask unanimous consent that the  text of  the bill be printed  in  the  RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 1038  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

761,220,2007-03-29,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, with my  colleagues, Senator BLANCHELINCOLN,  Senator GORDON and Senator  I rise to  introduce the  Elder Justice Act of 2007.  Senators LINCOLN, SMITH, KOHLand I  introduced similar legislation last Congress and former Senator John Breaux  and I were the lead sponsors of the  Elder Justice Act in the 107th and 108th  Congresses, with the strong support of  Senators LINCOLN, SMITH and KOHL.  While the legislation has been reported  unanimously  by  the Finance Committee  in  the  109th and  108th Congresses, it, unfortunately, has not become law. I am here to say that will  not be the case this Congress.  I would like to take this opportunity  to highlight the provision of the Elder  Justice Act. This  legislation  establishes an Elder Justice Coordinating  Council to make recommendations to  the Secretary of Health and Human  Services on the coordination of activities of the Federal, State, local and private agencies and entities relating to  elder abuse, neglect and exploitation.  It also provides a  first  time direct  funding stream separate from the Social Services Block Grant  for adult  protective  services.  In addition,  the  Elder Justice Act creates an advisory  board to create a short and long-term  multidisciplinary strategic plan for the  developing field of elder justice.  The legislation creates new forensic  centers to promote detection and increase  expertise—new programs will  train health professionals in both forensic pathology and geriatrics. The  bill also authorizes $10 million for national organizations or States that represent or train long-term care ombudsman representatives to provide training, technical assistance, demonstration programs and research to improve  ombudsman effectiveness in addressing  abuse and neglect  in nursing homes  and assisted living facilities.  In addition, the Elder Justice Act requires immediate reporting to law enforcement of crimes  in a  long-term  care facility. It also allows the seven  State demonstration projects authorized through the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 to be completed and directs  the Secretary  of Health  and  Human Services to report the findings  to the appropriate congressional committees no later than six months after  the completion of the demonstration  projects.  The  bill  also  authorizes  $500,000 to determine the efficacy of establishing and maintaining a national  nurse aide registry. Finally, the legislation authorizes $20 million in grants  to  enhance  long-term  care  staffing  through training and recruitment to  establish employee incentives including career and wage benefit ladders and  programs  to  improve management  practices.  With more  than  77 million  baby  boomers retiring over the next three  decades, we cannot wait any longer for  this legislation to pass. One of my top  priorities of the 110th Congress is having the Elder Justice Act signed into  law. Older Americans deserve nothing  less.  In closing, our legislation has been  endorsed by the Elder Justice Coalition, a national membership organization  dedicated  to  eliminating  elder  abuse,  neglect,  and  exploitation  in  America. This  coalition, which has  been a strong advocate and supporter  of the Elder Justice Act, has over 500  members.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation  so we can provide older  Americans the same protections that  we provide to our children and victims  of domestic violence.  ",2007

Importantly, it gives tribute to hundreds of  thousands of people who have died from  exposure.  To me, this resolution is very personal Deaths from exposure to asbestos  are common in my home State of Montana—all too common. Libby, MT is a  small community in the western part  of Montana. Libby  is a very unique  place.  It is surrounded by the beauty and  splendor of the Cabinet Mountains. But  it is also plagued with sickness and disease. The extent of asbestos contamination in Libby, the number of people  who are sick, the amount of people who  have died from asbestos exposures just  staggering.  The community of Libby suffers from  asbestos related diseases at 40 to 60  times higher than the rest of the country. Folks in Libby are diagnosed with  mesothelioma, the deadly form of cancer from asbestos, at 100 times higher  than the average rate.  Mesothelioma recently took the life  of a very dear  friend of mine  from  Libby—Les Skramstad.  Just  a  few  weeks ago, I came to the floor to talk  about Les and how he was an outspoken advocate for Libby.  Until the day he died, Les worked  tirelessly to share his story and the  story of Libby’s quiet emergency.  The first night I met Les in January  of 2000, he challenged me to help all  those in Libby suffering from asbestos-  related diseases. Les challenged me ‘‘to  do something.’’  He said: MAX, please, as a man like  me—as someone’s father too, as someone’s husband, as someone’s son, help  me. Help us.

Leavitt, S.S.,  commend him for his 27 years of service as  President-Rector of St. Mary’s Seminary and  University  in Baltimore, Maryland, and wish  him well in his retirement.  In 1962, Father Leavitt began his philosophical and theological studies at St. Mary’s  and has since remained fully dedicated to the  spirit of  the seminary.  In 1968, he was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Hartford,  Connecticut and appointed to the faculty of St.  Mary’s.  His ability to articulate a compelling vision  for the seminary led to his being elected the  fourteenth President and first President-Rector  of St. Mary’s, a position he has held longer  than anyone in the seminary’s proud 215–year  history.  Saint Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of  San Francisco, was once asked what a person had to do to lead a good life, to which he  replied, ‘‘Preach the Gospel. Sometimes use  words.’’ Father Leavitt has done  just  that,  preaching by example to generations of students.  As President-Rector, Father Leavitt has presided over construction and rebeautification efforts of the seminary as well as successfully  enlarged the endowment to ensure the long-  term viability of the institution. He has worked  to expand the spiritual, intellectual, and pastoral resources necessary to prepare students  for the priesthood.  As a philosopher, theologian, teacher, and  preacher, he has re-energized the St. Mary’s  community and  instilled a sense of principle  and potential to our nation’s first Catholic seminary.  It is an honor for me to congratulate Father  Leavitt  for his  tireless commitment  to education, faith, and leadership and recognize the  truly exemplary impact he has made within our  greater faith community. I wish him well in his  retirement.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF BRIGADIER  GENERAL WILLIAM J. SHARROW  HON. DON YOUNG  OFALASKA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2007  ",2007
777,241,2007-03-29,Mr. YOUNG of Alaska.," Madam Speaker,  today I wish to honor Brigadier General William J. Sharrow—a truly great American. Bill  has  tirelessly served  this country  for many  years, managing some of our country’s important military  programs. Most  recently, Bill  served as my State Director, where he dedicated himself to tirelessly working for the people of Alaska.  Born in Witherbee, New York on August 19,  1932, Bill entered  the Army  in 1952. He  served with the 867th AAA Battalion at Fort  Richardson, Alaska until his discharge in November 1954. He returned home to New York  and joined an Army Reserve Unit. However,  he realized his heart was back in Alaska and  returned a short time later to make Alaska his  permanent home. Bill joined the Alaskan Army  National Guard where he served as First Sergeant of Company D, 207th Infantry Battalion  until he was commissioned in November 1956.  Some of Bill’s many roles  in  the National  Guard include: radio repairman, supply officer,  administrative assistant, personnel officer and  Command Administrative Assistant to the Adjutant General. His military assignments range  from platoon leader to battalion commander.  He served as Chief of Staff  for  the Alaska  Army National Guard from 1972 to 1974 and  was appointed as Assistant Adjutant General  on February 7, 1974. Bill’s dedication to our  Nation was federally recognized on June 25,  1974 when he was promoted  to Brigadier  General.  During his 20 plus years of service to Alaska and to his country, Bill remained a strong  leader who set an example of achievement  that was  unmatched. He  represented  the  United States with honor and dignity and continuously strove for excellence. The loss to the  United States the day Bill left his post, was a  great gain to me and to all Alaskans.  Bill worked for me for 24 years as my State  Director. When I was unable to attend an important function or meeting, it was Bill that I always be trusted to represent me. We share a  common love of Alaska and its people and it  was comforting for me to know that when work  forced me to remain in Washington, Bill would  always be there to listen to the Alaskan people and keep them informed of our work.  Bill has been happily married  to Margaret  for 52 years and is the father of 3 sons: David  who lives in Anchorage, AK; Phillip who lives  in Auckland, New Zealand; and Steven who  lives in Fairbanks, AK. He is also the grandfather to 6 grandchildren. I know that Bill is  looking forward to spending more time with his  family and traveling around the world with the  love of his life, Marg.  Bill has always provided sage advice to colleagues and staff and done so with quick wit  and much humor. Bill was an invaluable employee and he will be sorely missed but he  continues to be a dear friend and confidant. I  will miss his daily leadership and guidance but  know that our friendship will endure. My wife  Lu and I wish him and Marg all the best as  they embark on this new chapter of their lives.

778,241,2007-03-29,Mr. KUCINICH.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor Thurman R. Payne, a man who  worked  tirelessly at Brookpark Ford  for 50  years and served diligently as the President of  Local 1250  for  two  terms, as  the Building  Chairman of the Cleveland Casting Plant, and  as President of the Foundry Council.  Thurman R. Payne is an advocate of worker’s rights, supporting equality for all of his fellow brothers and sisters. Thurman’s advocacy  garnered enough national attention  that  the  great civil rights leader Rosa Parks visited the  Union Hall.  During Thurman’s first term as President of  Local 1250, challenging economic conditions  caused layoffs and a decrease in morale. During these tough times, Thurman rallied his co-  workers to take a stance against layoffs and to  advocate for quality products in order to assure job security in the future.  Thurman R. Payne was an  innovator  in  many ways. As President of Local 1250, Thurman began a program to help further the education of all of his brothers and sisters. He  made educational opportunities accessible to  these men and women of Local 1250 by placing a  trailer on  the Union’s  lot, where any  member could go for various educational opportunities.  Thurman R. Payne retired on September 1,  2006 after 50 years of advocating  for  labor  rights. Thurman  is currently battling cancer.  Though this is a different sort of challenge, we  know that he will battle this disease with the  same amount of energy and optimism as he  had during his years at Ford.  Madam Speaker and colleagues, please join  me in honoring Thurman R. Payne, a man that  dedicated 50 years of his life to ensure that  his  fellow brothers and sisters were  treated  with equality, had opportunities to further their  education, and had job security.  f  IN HONOR OF THE BRAVE AND  COMMENDABLE PUBLIC SERVICE  OF MARY CODY  HON.

784,6,2007-04-10,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for representation of the Committee on Finance in a  proceeding in the U.S. District Court  for the District of Columbia. The Finance Committee has obtained  from  that court, in connection with a hearing  the  committee  is holding  this  Thursday, a writ compelling the production of a Federal prisoner, whom  the committee has scheduled to appear  as a witness before it.  Notwithstanding the long history of  congressional committee seeking, and  the court’s approving, such writs to authorize the production of Federal prisoners to provide needed testimony before Congress, the U.S. Department of  Justice has moved to quash the writ in  response to objections made by the Bureau of Prisons to decisions the committee made about the organization of  its hearing and presentation of its witnesses. The Justice Department’s motion to quash challenges the authority  of the court to issue a writ compelling  a federal prisoner to be produced to appear in a congressional as opposed to a  judicial proceeding.  This  resolution will authorize  the  Senate legal counsel to represent the  Finance Committee in connection with  this proceeding in order to protect the  committee’s interests in obtaining testimony it needs.

801,20,2007-04-10,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  I  wish to explain to my colleagues why I  will vote against S. 5 in its present  form, and I believe it will probably be  in its present form as we vote on it.  We in Congress are petitioned every  day by  individuals, by  families, by  companies,  by  interest  groups,  and  other entities that have a stake  in  what the Federal Government does. We  were elected to this great body to represent people back home, and to provide reasonable solutions to everyday  problems that we confront here in the  Congress.  I meet people  in Iowa every week  who seek cures for different diseases  and different disorders. They seek results, and we fight to provide them results so that life is better, life expectancy is longer. Americans want Congress to fund medical research, and we  do it in a big way. That is why we provided nearly $30 billion annually for  the National  Institutes  of Health,  which is the leading organization on  health-related research.  We all know and love someone who  has suffered from a devastating disease  or disorder. My wife is a breast cancer  survivor; my brother died of a stroke;  my sister died of an aortic aneurysm. I  have  friends with diabetes, Parkinson’s, and Lou Gehrig’s disease. I have  known many who have lost a battle to  cancer, and others who  face a  long  struggle with Alzheimer’s disease.  I want cures as well as everybody  else wanting cures. I want to believe  that the pain and suffering will end as  much as anyone wants it to end. But I  cannot in good conscience support a  bill that forces American taxpayers to  fund  research  that  requires  the destruction of innocent human life. This  is a slippery slope.  I wish to address six key points that  have  been  put  forward  by Robert  George and by Thomas Berg. They were  made in an op-ed piece from the Wall  Street Journal on March 13, this year.  These authors state that responsible  and productive debate  is often  lost  amidst confusion and misperceptions  surrounding  the  issue of  embryonic  stem cell research. Both sides of this  debate have reasonable arguments. But  these authors, including this Senator,  believe embryonic-destructive research  cannot be morally justified.  First, Professor George and Reverend  Berg rightly point out there is not a  ban on human embryonic stem cell research in the United States. Yet I believe people in this body leave that impression.

I yield to a leader on all our health  care issues for so many years, and I  think he is recognized as such by the  entire country.

805,27,2007-04-10,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  I  thank my friends, Senators HARKINand  SPECTER, for the extraordinary leadership they have provided on the extraordinary leadership they have provided  on this issue, which is so important to  families in our country. We deal with a  lot of issues around this body. But this  particular  legislation probably offers  more hope to more people than perhaps  anything else we will do here in the  Senate this year.  When we think of all of the various  kinds of illnesses and diseases and accidents that have affected so many families here in the Senate—and, most importantly, the American families—we  know we have the best  in terms of  treatment for these illnesses and sicknesses in the United States for those  who are able to receive it. Still, all of  these illnesses and sicknesses have defied the ablest and most gifted minds  until very recently, and that is with  the discovery that started about 10  years ago with  the opportunity  for  using stem cells, which can play a very  indispensable role in providing a cure  for these individuals.  That  is what this  is basically all  about—an  extraordinary  opportunity  that is out there, and whether we in  the United States are going to permit  the great institution—the greatest institution for research—the National Institutes of Health to be able to unleash  the vastness of the creativity, brilliance, and ability of those researchers  and scientists to try to unlock the  cures for so many of these diseases, and  do it in a way that is ethically sound,  and for so many of the reasons that  have been spelled out.  This is an enormously timely bill. I  thank Senator HARKIN for his persistence and for ensuring we were going to  be able to have this on the floor of the  Senate in a timely way. I thank Senator REID for scheduling this. I thank  the broad bipartisan coalition that has  come together on our side and on the  other side of the aisle which has given  strong support for this legislation.  It is pretty popular at this time in  Washington  to  talk  about  the  differences that exist in our Nation’s Capital. There are some very important  ones. We have come together, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate—those who have over a long period  of time advocated the pro-life position  and those who have felt there should be  an ability for individuals to make judgments about their own future—in support of this legislation. So this is a  very special time, and this vote we are  going to have tomorrow is enormously  important.  Again, I thank my colleagues and  friends  for bringing us to the point  where we are today. Nearly a decade  ago, American scientists made the revolutionary discovery that tiny cells,  called  stem cells, held  the extraordinary potential to offer new hope and  new help in the fight against diabetes  and Parkinson’s disease, spinal injury,  and many other illnesses.  Six years ago, many of us in the Senate  joined millions of patients and  their families in calling on President  Bush  to  support  this  lifesaving  research. Sadly, he rejected those calls  and instead imposed severe restrictions  on the search for the cures.  Since those severe limitations were  imposed, we have  struggled  to  free  American scientists from these unwarranted  restrictions.  Last  year, we  scored a great victory when the House  and Senate, with broad bipartisan majorities, voted  to end  those  restrictions. But those efforts came to naught  with a veto, and we are back at the  battle again.  I share that view of my colleagues  and friends in saying if we are not successful—although we are hopeful we  will be—we are going to continue this  battle day in and day out until we are  successful.  Today we renew our hope that the  President will start anew and consider  the merits of this new legislation instead of automatically picking up the  veto pen. When Congress passed the bipartisan stem cell bill last year, we  voted for hope, for progress, and for  life. But President Bush chose to dash  those hopes by vetoing the legislation.  Now we are taking up the cause once  again. Our legislation again brings together conservatives and progressives,  Members of Congress on both sides of  the debate over a woman’s right to  choose. Representatives from big cities, small towns, rural communities—  we all agree stem cell research must go  forward.  This legislation before us is only six  pages long. It is a short, simple bill  with enormous goals and vast potential. It overturns the unrealistic and  unreasonable restrictions on the embryonic stem cell research imposed by  the President’s Executive order 5 years  ago. His unilateral action bypassed  Congress  and  froze  progress  in  its  tracks by barring the NIH from funding  research using any stem cells derived  after August 9, 2001, an arbitrary date  chosen  solely  to  coincide with  the  President’s speech.  Many of us warned at that time that  this policy would delay the search for  new cures and put needless barriers in  the way of medical progress. At a  HELP Committee hearing days after  the Executive order was issued, many  of us raised concerns about the new  policy and urged the President to reconsider.  Our concerns were dismissed by the  administration, but  time has  shown  that each of the drawbacks we feared  then has become a  real barrier  to  progress today.  At the time of the Executive order,  the administration claimed that over  60  independent  stem  lines would be  available to NIH researchers. We found,  as our friend from California, Senator  FEINSTEIN, and Senator HARKINpointed  out earlier, that 21 of those stem lines  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:35 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S10AP7.REC S10AP7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007

I speak today in support of S. 5, the  Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act,  offered  by  the majority  leader,  to  whom we all owe a debt of gratitude for  bringing  this  important bill  to  the  floor. As a new Member of this body, as  is the Presiding Officer, it also gives  me great pride to express my appreciation for the leadership of Senator HARKIN, Senator SPECTER, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator HATCH, whose voices  over the years have placed us in the position to pass this legislation, as I hope  we will tomorrow.  I also wish to recognize the exceptional work and extraordinary leadership of my colleague and friend from  The  to  Rhode Island, Congressman JIMLANGEVIN. Congressman LANGEVINhas been  both a State and national leader on  this issue, championing the passage of  H.R. 810 in last year’s Congress and of  H.R. 3 in January, as well as playing an  integral role  in Rhode Island’s stem  cell dialogue. Just today he was with  our  Lieutenant Governor  Elizabeth  Roberts, as she issued her report, ‘‘Discovering Rhode Island’s Stem Cell Future:  Charting  the  Course  Toward  Health and Prosperity.’’ This report is  an important step toward developing a  comprehensive statewide plan for stem  cell research initiatives in Rhode Island.  Congressman LANGEVINdid not arrive  at his position on stem cell research  easily. He grappled, as we all do, with  the ethical and scientific  issues  involved, meeting with a host of individuals and groups spanning the ideological spectrum. After serious and heartfelt  consideration, he  concluded, as  have many of our Senate colleagues,  that a central part of his deeply held  beliefs about life is a commitment to  those who are challenged by diabetes,  by heart disease, by Alzheimer’s, by  Parkinson’s, by spinal cord injury, by  stroke, and by the myriad of diseases  and conditions that stem cell research  might help or even cure. I share this  deep commitment to stem cell research  and a sincere optimism about the hope  it offers for so many lives.  I want to share the story of one of  those lives. It is the story of Lila Barber, a 12-year-old girl from Westerly,  RI, who came to visit me here in Washington 2 weeks ago. In 2005, Lila started experiencing pain in her leg. The  pain got progressively worse over a 5-  month period, until it was keeping her,  and her parents, up all night. The Barbers began a medical  journey,  from  doctor to doctor and test to test, only  to be told that Lila had bursitis. As it  turned out, Lila did not have bursitis;  she had  osteosarcoma,  a  cancerous  bone tumor on her tibia below her  knee.  Years ago, doctors would have had no  option but to amputate Lila’s leg. But  reconstructive  techniques  have  improved, and most limbs can now be replaced with a metal and plastic artificial joint or a cadaver bone transplant.  Fortunately, Dr. Richard Terek, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in musculoskeletal oncology at Brown University, was able to save her leg using  such a cadaver bone transplant, which  preserves as much normal tissue as  possible. In the year following Lila’s  surgery, she was home-schooled as she  underwent 16 rounds of chemotherapy.  Lila’s chances of  long-term survival  are now good—75 percent.  But even if Lila remains cancer free,  she will  face a painful and ongoing  medical struggle. Since the donor bone  and cartilage are not  living, Lila’s  transplanted tibia will not grow as she  does. Even worse, it will break down  over time. This is a place where stem  cell research could vastly improve care  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:35 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S10AP7.REC S10AP7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007

820,41,2007-04-10,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President,  I  rise today in support of the Isakson-  Coleman stem cell research bill. For  me, this issue is personal on many levels, and it weighs heavily on my heart,  my mind, and my conscience. I have  given great care in coming to my decision to be a cosponsor of this bill and  have  spent much  time  reflecting,  thinking, and praying about making  the right decision on this issue of stem  cell research because it is a very controversial but yet a very forward-leaning issue.  Today we are debating the various  types of research and what many view  as the potential to cure diseases. There  is no question that everyone here is  supportive of medical research and, in  particular, of stem cell research. However,  there  is  still  so much  to be  learned from science, so many discoveries yet to be made, and so much that  we still do not know.  I am aware that there are very promising alternatives to embryonic stem  cell research, such as deriving stem  cells  from umbilical cord blood and  bone marrow. Those cells have demonstrated  the  capability of  turning  into most tissue types, thus helping to  provide the basis for advanced research  to find cures for diseases such as juvenile  diabetes,  Parkinson’s  disease,  sickle cell anemia, and heart disease.  Research  from adult stem cells has  saved thousands of lives, and funding  for this research certainly should continue.  While  I am  familiar with the advancements made  in the adult stem  cell research, there is still a lack of  scientific evidence to show that embryonic  stem  cell  research yields  the  strong results we have from the adult  stem cell lines. There is also the issue  of whether taxpayer dollars should be  used for research that many believe is  morally wrong.  While  the morality  of  embryonic  stem cell research is an issue for many  Americans, including myself, I also believe there is a constant need to continue working to advance science and  medical research. As a country, it is  important that we stay on the cutting  edge of medical research and remain  globally  competitive,  because  the  United States offers the best health  care in the world.  This legislation, introduced by Senators ISAKSON and COLEMAN, will not  only advance science, it will allow for  embryonic research to take place using  non-viable embryos. The cells in those  embryos have naturally quit dividing  and therefore would not be used for fertilization. Even if these embryos were  frozen or saved, no practicing physician would ever attempt to  implant  them because the developmental stages  have naturally stopped.  This legislation will allow the Department of Health and Human Services to extend Federal funding for research on embryonic stem cell  lines  only if the lines were derived without  harming a viable embryo. I believe this  approach is an effective way to provide  for advancements in science and give  them to those who are waiting  for  cures without compromising the value  of life.  Many of us have personally benefitted or had family members who benefitted from the advancements made in  modern medicine over the past 5, 10, or  20 years. I think we are all grateful for  the progress that has been made. It is  my most sincere hope that we continue  to see monumental steps made in medical  research—stem  cell  and  otherwise—and that we find cures for those  suffering  from diseases such as Alzheimer’s,  cancer, multiple  sclerosis,  and spinal cord injuries.  Make no mistake about it, if you sincerely, as a Member of this body, want  to see an advancement in the area of  medical stem cell research, this is the  alternative you must vote for because  this is a bill, if it gets the required  number of votes, which will go to the  President’s desk, and  it  is  the bill  which the President will sign, and we  can move forward on the issue of embryonic stem cell research. I am proud  to be a cosponsor and intend to vote for  this legislation. I urge my colleagues  to do the same.  I yield my unused time back to the  manager of the bill.  ",2007

823,48,2007-04-10,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, I thank  the Senator from New Jersey for a very  eloquent and poignant presentation of  his position on embryonic stem cell research. I think what the Senator reflected is, again, the hopes of so many  families in America who have a loved  one suffering from Alzheimer’s or juvenile diabetes, or a young person who  has had an accident and is a paraplegic  for life with a spinal cord injury. You  say: What can we do to help? How can  we help? Well, it is one thing to be  sympathetic—and we are sympathetic  to those who suffer from illnesses or injuries—but  if we have  it within our  grasp, as the Senator from New Jersey  said, to open some doors and see what  is behind those doors, it seems to me  we are compelled to do that.  We don’t know where the scientific  research may lead. But we do know if  we don’t do it, it is not going to lead  anywhere. We know that. As I said earlier, the foundations are there to give  hope to people that embryonic stem  cell research will lead to great discoveries  and  treatments  and  interventions. I can only say to my friend from  New Jersey that, in all of my meetings  with  scientists over  the  last dozen  years or more—and especially  since  Gerhardt and Thompson isolated stem  cells  in  1998—the  scientific  community’s enthusiasm  for this  is almost  boundless because  they  realize  that  harnessing  the  power  of  embryonic  stem cells that can develop into any  form of a cell in the body could lead to  interventions and cures that are now  beyond our grasp.  I listened to the Senator from New  Jersey,  especially when  he  talked  about opening doors. I have often likened biomedical research, scientific research, to saying if there are 10 doors,  and you don’t know what is behind any  of those doors, if you are only going to  open one door, what are your odds of  finding the right answer? Well, if you  open two doors, the odds get better. If  you open five doors, you know it is 50–  50. So the more doors we open, the better our chances are of finding these discoveries.  The Senator is right. If we open one  door at a time, the odds are always  going to be 10 to 1—or I guess it would  be 9 to 1. It would be 9 to 1 that you are  not going to find the right answer.  If we start opening all these doors  and get the scientists talking with one  another and looking at things, well,  that means the span of time that it  would take to find these cures is collapsed.  Scientists don’t work in a vacuum.  They collaborate. They talk with one  another. They read one another’s papers. They  find out what other scientists are doing. They find out if a scientist has opened a different door and  collaborate on that. That is why it is  necessary to begin to open these doors.  I thank the Senator from New Jersey  for talking about that point.  Earlier I was responding to the comments of my friend from Kansas, Senator BROWNBACK. He was talking about  72 diseases being treated with adult  stem cells. I pointed out his list inRECORD cluded several types of leukemia and  lymphomas, but I had printed in the  earlier a letter from George  Dahlman  of  the  Leukemia  and  Lymphoma Society saying they support S. 5.  Senator BROWNBACK’s  list also  included testicular cancer. I have a letter  from Craig Nichols, M.D., board member of the Lance Armstrong Foundation. Here is what he says:  As a member of  the Lance Armstrong  Foundation Board of Directors, I am writing  in response to assertions that adult stem  cells have treated or cured the disease of testicular cancer. . . . I feel it is important to  set the record straight on this issue. . . .  There is not an FDA-approved adult stem  cell treatment generally available to treat  testicular cancer. Rather, adult stem cells  enable testicular cancer patients to withstand a higher dose of chemotherapy during  treatment for the disease.  We support exploring every avenue of research,  including embryonic stem cell research within specified ethical limits, until a  cure is found.  The Lance Armstrong Foundation asks  that you and your colleagues pass S. 5, and  not accept any substitutes.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy  of this letter be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  LIVESTRONG,  LANCEARMSTRONGFOUNDATION,  APRIL6, 2007.  Hon. HARRYREID,  Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,  Washington, DC.  DEARSENATORREID: As a member of the  Lance Armstrong Foundation’s (LAF) Board  of Directors, I am writing in response to assertions that adult stem cells have treated  or cured the disease of testicular cancer.  While the mission of the LAF is to inspire  and empower people affected by all types of  cancer, I feel that it is important to set the  record straight on this issue.  Testicular cancer is the most common cancer among men ages 15–35 and approximately  8,000 men will be diagnosed with testicular  cancer in the United States this year. While  testicular cancer is one of the most curable  forms of cancer, our organization would like  to emphasize as the Senate debates S. 5, the  Stem Cell Research and Enhancement Act,  that we have not completely eradicated the  disease.  There is not an FDA-approved adult stem  cell treatment generally available to treat  testicular cancer. Rather, adult stem cells  enable testicular cancer patients to withstand a higher dose of chemotherapy during  treatment for the disease.  We support exploring every avenue of research,  including embryonic stem cell research within specified ethical limits, until a  cure is found. The most respected scientists  in our field view embryonic stem cells as an  area of research that must be explored, and  one that our government must make a commitment to support. The Lance Armstrong  Foundation asks that you and your colleagues pass S. 5, and not accept any substitutes.  Sincerely,  CRAIGNICHOLS, M.D.,  Member of the Board,  Lance Armstrong Foundation.

826,55,2007-04-10,Mr. SESSIONS.," I had heard at some  point that those lines may not be continuing, but I am informed that in fact  those lines do continue, at least some  of them, and that there is a substantial  number of embryonic cells available  for research if they were asked for, but  they haven’t been all utilized; is that  correct?  ",2007
827,55,2007-04-10,Mr. BROWNBACK., That is correct as  well.  ,2007
828,55,2007-04-10,Mr. SESSIONS.," So when we get up to  this line of experimenting with human  life, one of the things I would ask myself is, is this medically necessary? Is  this a matter about which we are debating that would prevent some sort of  research? The way I see it, there are  federally  funded stem cells available  for research today, as you have explained. Then there is no limit whatsoever on the number of stem cells that  are available in the private sector, at  our universities and our great research  centers in the world and in the United  States; is that correct?  ",2007
829,55,2007-04-10,Mr. BROWNBACK.," That is correct.  Any sort of private sector investment  can take place, any sort of State or  local  investment can take place, although, as I noted in the article, the  private sector does not seem to be putting much money into the field. I believe that is clearly because of a lack  of results.  ",2007
830,55,2007-04-10,Mr. SESSIONS.," I think that is important for you to share with us. Because decisions become easier when  there is not a crisis. We deal with self-  defense issues and moral issues a lot of  times, but doesn’t seem to me we are  at that critical  juncture  in our scientific activity that would require the  American people, through the expenditures of their dollars, to affirm this  procedure. Would  the  Senator  not  agree if the American people fund this  procedure,  then  it  represents a national blessing of the procedure, in effect, an approval of this procedure as  moral and legitimate?  ",2007
831,55,2007-04-10,Mr. BROWNBACK.," Well,  it clearly  does. It says you treat the youngest of  human life as property, not as a person. You noted this is alive. Yet some  would say it is not a life. It is alive,  but it has not yet risen to the level of  being a human life. This would say we  can treat humans at the youngest age  of their life continuum as property and  that we will use Federal taxpayer dollars to destroy them and to do research  on them at that point in time. If you  can do that at earlier stages, why not  later? What is the differentiation? At  what point in time does this become removed  from property to becoming a  person as it somehow does magically in  this process? My point is, the place to  start is at the beginning, when the life  begins. Otherwise, there is no significant place you can draw any line along  the way saying at this point in time it  becomes a person entitled to the protection of the law and society. Right  now we are treating the youngest of  humans as property.  ",2007
832,55,2007-04-10,Mr. SESSIONS.," I am uneasy about it.  I don’t claim  to know all of  it.  I  haven’t studied it to the extent you  have. I know entities of great augustness such as the Catholic Church have  serious  theologians  and  scientists.  They are uneasy with  it.  I am not  Catholic, but I understand that. People  have invested a lot of time and effort  and feel this is crossing a line that is  dangerous for us to cross. From what I  am hearing  from your remarks, you  don’t think it is necessary to cross that  line to do the kind of research that  could actually save lives and that we  all hope will save lives one day?  ",2007
833,55,2007-04-10,Mr. BROWNBACK.," If our objective is  healing people, if that is our objective,  we have a  far more  likely route, a  route that is already producing substantial success that is lying right in  front of us, without ethical concerns or  dilemmas—adult  stem  cells,  cord  blood. Increasingly, in the future, in  amniotic fluid we will find abundant  supplies of stem cells with no moral  problems whatsoever. That  is what  doesn’t make any sense to me either.  We are going to take away all human  dignity from the youngest humans. We  are going to do so in an arbitrary fashion because we are not saying where  you develop the status of human dignity at some point in time, but we are  going to take it away from you here.  We are going to use Federal taxpayer  dollars to destroy you. Yet we have another way that is producing good results in the adult stem cells, stem cells  in your body and in mine, and this  route is producing tumors. It doesn’t  seem to make a whole lot of sense why  we would invest $613 million more into  the future as we have in the past since  2002. Why would you put more into this  area that has all these problems? I respect my colleagues who are on the  other side of this debate. They want to  produce results and they want to cure  people. But it seems as if all the evidence is leading us the other way without ethical dilemma. So why would we  then do that,  if all the evidence  is  pointing another way and we don’t  have unlimited resources, we can’t put  this to better, higher use, and not having hopefully people in the future have  to leave our country to get adult stem  cell therapies from out of country?  ",2007
834,55,2007-04-10,Mr. SESSIONS.,"  I will say this,  I  thank you for utilizing the free speech  this great Senate allows us to raise  questions that some perhaps  just as  soon would not talk about. I do think a  decent respect  for those millions of  Americans who strongly believe this is  not a good thing to do, that this is  crossing boundaries we ought not to  cross, and saying we are going to take  your money in disrespect of your views  and spend it on a procedure you strongly feel is not the right thing, committing our Nation officially as approving  this procedure is not a bridge we have  to cross. That is where I come down at  this point. I do not claim to be all  knowing, but that is what I would say.  I say to Senator BROWNBACK, I would  share with you a letter I received in  March, just about a month ago, from a  constituent in my State who e-mailed  me in support of S. 5, and I sent back  some of the thoughts my staff and I  had put together on it. I got this letter.  It is addressed to me, but it could probably be better addressed to you based  on the work you and others have done.  He had a child who had a recent four-  wheeler  accident  and was  a  quadriplegic. This is his quote:  In our desire to see our son again have use  of his limbs, we allowed our opinions to be  influenced by the media. You were so kind to  respond to our e-mail with a letter stating  your opinions and  thoughts. After doing  more research, listening to the opinions of a  long-time quadriplegic, and praying about  this issue, we are pleased with the position  you have taken against this legislation. We  felt we owed you an apology—  They certainly did not—  and thank you for your adherence to Christian moral boundaries when voting on public  policy.  I know a lot of people have different  views on this issue, and some think everybody in the country has a certain  view on it. But I think if more people  understood the remarks you made, the  great research that  is ongoing that  could actually cure or heal spinal cord  injuries, could help with diabetes and  Parkinson’s and other diseases—if this  were critical to the passage of this legislation, I think we would have a more  difficult choice to make.  But I think, as you have explained it,  at this point in history and in science,  we are at a point where that research  can continue. It is not stopped, and it  is not necessary for us to make that  final step to cross this barrier and  begin to officially, as a nation, experiment with human life.  So I say to the Senator, thank you  for your work. You have led me around  to this position. I think I will not be  supporting S. 30 and will be supporting  S. 5. I think it is a better way—excuse  me, which one  is  it,  I ask Senator  BROWNBACK?  ",2007
835,55,2007-04-10,Mr. BROWNBACK., S. 30.  ,2007
836,55,2007-04-10,Mr. SESSIONS.," Yes, I think you are  correct. I will be supporting S. 30 and  voting against S. 5. And this has been  an  important debate. The American  people have had the opportunity to  hear some good arguments and a great  deal of science and research. We are  heading in the right direction, I believe, with the President saying he will  not accept S. 5. I respect him for it. He  stood up, absolutely. He has studied  the issue, and he has firm views about  it. Whereas the legislation may pass  here, I am hopeful it will not finally  become law.  Thank you very much.  ",2007

838,62,2007-04-10,Mr. ISAKSON., Those embryos developed in in vitro fertilization would in  all cases be eggs fertilized for the purpose of creating a viable embryo.  ,2007
839,62,2007-04-10,Mr. HARKIN., Right.  ,2007
840,62,2007-04-10,Mr. ISAKSON.," The difference, with  all due respect—and I have great respect for the Senator and the character  and the quantity and the content of  this debate—if you ultimately want to  further embryonic stem cell research  in the environment that we have, the  Gardner principle division in in vitro  fertilization for level 3 for the natural  death of the embryo, that bridges the  ethical question on the destruction of  an embryo that was otherwise viable  and would be  something  the White  House would sign. So it would further  embryonic stem cell research under a  proven method which exists today, and  NIH, in five different cases, is invested  in in terms of BG01, 02 and 03, which  happen to be the lines with which I am  familiar. With all due respect, since we  both prohibit the fertilization of eggs  for the purpose of deriving cells for scientific research, it is a matter of how  you draw that line.  I appreciate the Senator giving me  the time to make that explanation.  ",2007
841,62,2007-04-10,Mr. HARKIN.," Again, it is a good debate. We should have more of these  kinds of exchanges on the Senate floor.  I respect my friend, and I respect his  approach. Again, we have  our  differences  in  the way we  approach  things. I picked up on one word my  friend just said—the ‘‘environment’’ in  which we are operating. I assume he  means the environment being the Presidential declaration of August 9, 2001,  that only Federal  funding could be  used for stem cells derived prior to 9  p.m. but none after that. I assume that  is  the  environment we are  talking  about.  ",2007
842,62,2007-04-10,Mr. ISAKSON.," If the Senator will let  me respond, that is precisely what I am  talking about. As we have had 51⁄2years  since the Presidential directive, and  since  we—fortunately,  and  unbeknownst to me certainly, and probably  the Senator  from  Iowa, none of us  knew you would have these five lines in  those original lines that were grandfathered. So we have had 51⁄2years of  experience at NIH, with lines derived  without destroying physically a viable  embryo, but it would, rather, be a natural death. So since you have that, and  since it doesn’t cross that ethical line,  that is what I was referring to. And  you would have the opportunity to further the science in a bill that can be  passed and not vetoed. So, with all due  respect, that is what I was referring to.  ",2007
843,62,2007-04-10,Mr. HARKIN.," That is what I thought.  My proposal is to change the environment. That is what we have to do. I say  we have to change the environment.  The American people want it changed,  the  scientific  community wants  it  changed, the head of NIH—former head  of NIH  and  525  different  advocacy  groups out there want it changed. Why  should one person—the President of the  United States—have the say-so of what  is moral and what is not moral, depending upon a time?  ",2007
844,62,2007-04-10,Mr. ISAKSON., May I respond?  ,2007
845,62,2007-04-10,Mr. HARKIN.," Sure, but why is 9 p.m.  of August 9 the moral dividing  line  that Federal funds can be used on stem  cell lines? Before that it is moral, but  after that it is immoral. I cannot understand that.  ",2007
846,62,2007-04-10,Mr.  ISAKSON.,"  I will never, hopefully, debate or question any individual’s judgment and morality. I admire  it in everybody, and I admire the Senator from Iowa and his principles. The  President has made his statement and  has said what he would do. My reference was that if science, in the last  51⁄2years, has shown us this is a way to  further that science without crossing  that  line, then with respect  for his  principles and morals, I am looking to  find ways that fit rather than ways to  argue. That is my point.  ",2007
847,62,2007-04-10,Mr. HARKIN.," I appreciate that. We  have to do what we can do sometimes  here. Certainly, we have been funding  adult stem cell research. Senator SPECTERand I have made certain of that in  our Appropriations Committee.  ",2007
848,62,2007-04-10,Mr. ISAKSON., And also $132 million  for embryonic—those 21 lines.  ,2007
849,62,2007-04-10,Mr. HARKIN.," Don’t get me started  on that because those have all been  contaminated on mouse  feeder cells.  My  friend  from Oklahoma said that  was not true the other day, but it is  true. They have been growing on mouse  feeder cells, every one of them. Again,  we don’t know if they will ever be able  to be used  for any kind of human  therapies. Maybe yes, maybe no. We do  know that the 400-some stem cell lines  derived  since  then privately, or by  State involvement, or whatever, have  not been used on mouse feeder cells. We  know  those, more  than  likely, will  have  the capacity of being used  in  human therapy.  I respect people’s morality, but I just  don’t know that I like it when somebody imposes their self-imposed morality on all of the American people. I respect the President’s moral views, I  really do. But I have a hard time understanding how the President can say  Federal funding should not be used for  embryonic stem cell research if they  were derived after 9 p.m., August 9,  2001, and before that it is morally OK.  For the life of me, I have never been  able to understand that.  If it is morally unacceptable to use  Federal dollars for embryonic stem cell  research, then it ought not to be used  for these 21 lines either.  ",2007
850,62,2007-04-10,Mr. ISAKSON.," The Senator makes  the point, but if the Senator will yield,  I will simply respond.  The President issued that directive  in August of 2001. He established that  date of August 9. The White House has  now said that in the case of S. 30, had  the stem cells survived from the naturally dead prohibition, they would live.  That is not everything the Senator  from Iowa would like. I understand and  respect that. Acknowledging the nice  things you said about the legislation,  it is a ray of sunshine in the furtherance of that research. I am grateful to  the Senator for the time he has allotted me.  ",2007
851,62,2007-04-10,Mr. HARKIN.," Quite frankly, that is  why I don’t have any problems with  this line of research. All I can say to  my friend is that all of the scientists  who write me  letters and who have  weighed  in  on  this  issue,  and  the  groups that rely upon scientists and  Nobel laureates, they all say that this  might be an area of interest, but it  doesn’t substitute for lifting the ban. I  am hopeful. I guess I am a hopeful person.  I am hopeful that the President will  understand that we are not asking him  to cross his moral line. He said repeatedly through his spokespeople, very recently, that the one bright  line the  President will not cross is using Federal funds to destroy embryos. I wish  they would read the bill. S. 5 doesn’t  provide money for the destruction of  embryos. We don’t do that now. We  have not done it in the past. So, therefore, this bill should be able to be  signed because it doesn’t provide one  single cent of taxpayer dollars for the  destruction of embryos. Of course, neither does the bill of the Senator from  Georgia; of course not. So that is why  I am a hopeful person, thinking that  the President or his people will read  this and say: You are right. We have  stricter ethical guidelines in this bill  than exist right now.  So I am hopeful. I am hopeful that we  can get this job done.  Anyway, I just wanted to make one  other point tonight before I yield the  floor.  ",2007
852,62,2007-04-10,Mr.  ISAKSON.," Before the Senator  does  that,  I appreciate  the Senator  asking the questions and allowing me  the opportunity to respond and, hopefully, in some way clear up, if not totally at least say where we are coming  from based on the scientists I have  talked to. I respect him very much.  ",2007
853,62,2007-04-10,Mr. HARKIN.,"  I wish we could do  more of this on the Senate floor. By  having respect for one another’s opinions and thought processes and sources  of information, I think we can get a  clearer understanding of where people  are coming from. Lots of times we give  our speech and  leave and nobody  is  around discussing anything.  Some of the best times I have had on  the Senate  floor were debating Phil  Gramm of Texas. We used to get into  some good debates. He was always willing to give and take and talk back and  forth in a congenial manner. We need  more of that on the floor of the Senate.  That is just my opinion.  Mr. President,  I want to say one  other thing that came up. Again, it has  to do with understanding these kinds  of moral lines, so to speak. It is true  that we all started out as an embryo. I  want to remind people what an embryo  is. It is a blastocyst that has between  100 and 200 cells.

854,69,2007-04-10,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute  to Robert D. Evans, who retired on  February 28, after 35 years of distinguished service with the American Bar  Association, including services as director of the ABA’s Governmental Affairs Office.  Born in Vermont, Bob received his  B.A. from Yale University in 1966 and  his law degree from the University of  Michigan in 1969. He began his legal career at the Chicago firm known today  as Sachnoff & Weaver, practicing corporate and commercial law. When an  opportunity to work on public policy  issues arose, he joined the ABA Chicago staff in 1972, and soon found himself working in the ABA’s Washington,  DC, office. Since 1982, Bob has served as  director of the Governmental Affairs  Office, providing strong leadership on  many  issues,  including  judicial  independence, tax reform, the PATRIOT  Act, and numerous anticrime and antiterrorism bills. Perhaps what people  will remember most is Bob’s career-  long effort to guarantee access to justice for all through the development  and preservation of the Legal Services  Corporation, which  funds  local  legal  aid programs to help low-income individuals and  families deal with basic  legal problems that affect day-to-day  living.  Bob is listed in ‘‘Who’s Who in America’’ and  ‘‘Who’s Who  in American  Law.’’  He  has  received  numerous  awards  and  commendations  for  his  dedicated and tireless work in seeking  equal justice for America’s poor, including recognition from the National  Legal Aid and Defender Association  and the National Clients Council.  Bob has also made outstanding contributions to Washington-area communities.  He  has  served Washington  Grove, MD, as mayor and town council  member, and  currently  sits on  the  Washington Grove Planning Commission. Bob has also chaired the Associations Division of the National Capital  Area United Way Campaign, and has  helped to raise millions of dollars for  DC area charities to support those in  need. He also was president of Project  Northstar, a homeless children’s tutoring program for homeless children in  the District of Columbia.  With his dedication to the rule of  law, his professionalism, his expertise  and his unfailing good humor, Bob has  fulfilled the highest ideals and goals of  the legal profession. He has improved  the  administration  of  justice,  and  brought greater access to  legal representation and American justice for  all persons,  regardless of  their economic or social condition. Bob will be  greatly missed. I join his many colleagues and friends in wishing Bob, his  wife Kathie, and their daughter Sarah  much happiness in the years to come.  f  HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES  PRIVATEFIRSTCLASSSTEPHENK. RICHARDSON  ",2007
855,69,2007-04-10,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to humbly honor a Bridgeport,  CT, soldier who lost his life in the service of our country: Private First Class  Stephen K. Richardson.  On Tuesday, March 20, the 22-year-  old Private First Class Richardson and  another  soldier were killed when a  roadside bomb exploded near their vehicle in Baghdad. Now Stephen is being  remembered for his spirit of service,  for his devotion to his country, and for  his love of his family.  Stephen  served with  the  1st Battalion, 28th Infantry, 4th Brigade, 1st  Infantry Division, which  has  been  charged with securing Baghdad. Private First Class Richardson took on  that mission willingly: ‘‘He wanted to  be part of America’s protection,’’ said  his grandmother,  Ina Jackson.  ‘‘He  wanted to help resolve the problems in  Iraq.’’ Like nearly every other soldier  who has enlisted since the start of the  Iraq war, Private First Class Richardson knew exactly where he was going  and exactly what risks he’d be facing  which makes his sacrifice all the more  admirable.  Those who were close  to Stephen  know just what a fine young life has  been cut off. Edward Geist, a professor  at the University of Bridgeport, remembers teaching him. ‘‘He was older  than my other students he took the  work more seriously,’’ said Professor  Geist. He still remembers an essay Private First  Class Richardson wrote  about his future plans returning to his  family’s home in Jamaica and starting  a business to help improve living conditions. ‘‘It was much more reflective  and serious than what we normally  get,’’ Stephen’s professor said. I think  that seriousness of purpose was exactly  what drove Private First Class Richardson  to  serve his  country and a  glimpse of the bright future he might  have had in store.

858,5,2007-04-19,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MATSUI)  for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  (Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked  and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)  ",2007
859,5,2007-04-19,Mr. HASTINGS of Washington.," Mr.  Speaker, in the 107th, 108th, and the  109th Congresses, the House considered  and passed legislation to provide for  conservation and development of water  and related resources, and to authorize  the construction of various projects in  order to improve rivers and harbors in  the United States.  Unfortunately, differences could not  be resolved with the other body, and  these bipartisan bills,  therefore, did  not become law. The legislation before  us today mirrors legislation that was  approved by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of the House in the last  Congress, and I am confident it will  enjoy large bipartisan support today.  Mr. Speaker, our Nation’s water resource infrastructure is critical to our  economy,  transportation  system,  power generation, flood control and environmental  protection  and  restoration. This is especially true in my area  in the Pacific Northwest. Our region’s  major river, the Columbia River and its  tributaries,  is a great resource, one  that must be well managed and protected.  Hydroelectric  dams  provide  clean,  low-cost, renewable power. These  facilities also provide a system of locks  that allow for the efficient transportation of tons of agricultural products  to coastal ports, which reduces congestion on our highways and our rail systems.  The coastal ports that receive the  river-barged goods and products are the  gateways to overseas markets and also  need careful attention. The success of  farmers and manufacturers throughout  the Pacific Northwest depend on these  ports  being  navigable  and  appropriately maintained.  Mr. Speaker, there are several provisions in the Water Resources Development Act that are important to individuals and communities that I represent  in central Washington, and  I  would  like to highlight those provisions.  Like the WRDA bill passed by the  House in the last Congress, I am particularly pleased that the committee  has included language in the manager’s  amendment to permit Corps of Engineer employees working at dams in the  Pacific Northwest  to participate  in  wage surveys that are conducted to determine their rate of pay. This important provision would allow these employees the same participation allowed  to similar employees at dams in the region operated by the Bonneville Power  Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation. This is a matter of fair and  equal treatment, and I appreciate the  committee agreeing with my request  on this matter.  This bill also includes language that  would allow the Corps to officially give  credit to the Port of Sunnyside  for  funding  it has  invested to maintain  progress on its wetland restoration and  wastewater  treatment  project. This  project is a creative initiative by the  Port of Sunnyside to  improve river  habitat in the Yakima River, and provide  for greater economic growth  in  the  local community. This provision  ensures that the Port of Sunnyside  gets proper credit for funds it invested  as it works with the Corps to make this  project a reality.  Finally, this legislation lifts Corps  restrictions on the development of several Port of Pasco properties. I am very  hopeful that elimination of these flowage  easements will allow beneficial  uses of this prime riverfront property  to move forward for the betterment of  Pasco and the Tri-Cities.  Mr. Speaker, we must keep our commitment to sustain and enhance our  Nation’s water resource infrastructure,  and that requires a regular review and  updating of congressional direction to  the Corps of Engineers to ensure that  existing projects are maintained and  that new needs are met.  I am hopeful that this necessary legislation will soon become law.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
860,5,2007-04-19,Ms. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 8  minutes to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. BLUMENAUER).  ",2007
861,5,2007-04-19,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker, I  appreciate the gentlelady’s courtesy in  permitting me to speak on this rule  and on this bill.  I further appreciate what this represents. It has been my privilege to  PETERWELCHand TOMPETRI serve for the last 10 years on the Water  Resources Subcommittee for Transportation and  Infrastructure. Over that  period of time, I have watched as we  have focused legislation to deal with  the amazing needs that face water resources around the country.  Unfortunately, the  legislation that  we have passed  through  this House  with  strong  support  in  recent Congresses has never been able to find its  way into law. I think that with this  legislation, we are able to find a way to  help break the impasse.  I would like to speak to one of the  elements that was in that legislation  that has been made in order by the  Rules Committee, an amendment that  I am offering along with my colleagues  to help  bring the Corps of Engineers into the  21st century by updating the principles  and guidelines under which it operates.  Our amendment takes a step back  from  the politics and  controversies  that have surrounded the Corps’ activities over recent years. In fact, there  has been some finger-pointing at the  Corps, but frankly, Congress itself is  part of the problem and can be part of  a process that can help move this forward.  These principles and guidelines are  used for the formulation, evaluation,  and implementation of water resources  projects. The current rules under which  the Corps operates have not been updated since 1983. It seems hard to believe, given how important water resources are and how much we have  learned about the science, about hydrology since 1983.  Think about it for a moment. In 1983,  Ronald Reagan was President. We were  dealing with the movie ‘‘Return of the  Jedi.’’ A year later, the 3.5-inch floppy  disk was introduced, and IBM was soon  to launch the first portable computer  which weighed 30 pounds. Half the people who work for me in my congressional office weren’t even born in 1983.  Every Member of the House is aware  how much has changed since 1983 in  terms of technology, science, environmental policy, our national priorities,  and our understanding of water  resources. Yet, the Corps of Engineers  and the thousands of dedicated men  and women who work for them have a  planning process that has not kept up.  It was my privilege with the former  head of the Corps, General Flowers, to  meet with representatives of all of the  planning agencies for the Corps across  the country. They understand the problems; they are striving to make some  adjustments. We are still developing  projects, yet they are still working  under an umbrella that was based on  principles and guidelines when James  Watt was Secretary of the Interior.  This amendment is very simple. It directs the Secretary of the Army to update the principles and guidelines in  consultation with all the other Federal  agencies that have a stake in the process, to work with the public to deal  with what we have learned over the  last quarter of a century.

The least of all  who know is the other side.  One thing we do know is that it was  a perversion. It would have been a perversion to even allow a vote about  guns, a vote about guns that would  have deprived the District of its own  right to decide the issue in order to decide whether it should have a vote.  The decision therefore to pull the bill  was legal and the delay saved the principle that we should be voting on one  basic right, the basic right that is before us  today  in  the House Voting  Rights Act.

863,12,2007-04-19,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY).  ",2007
864,12,2007-04-19,Mr. MCHENRY.," I thank my colleague  from Texas (Mr. SESSIONS) for yielding  the time.  Mr. Speaker, today we are engaged in  a very serious debate. It is a constitutional debate. Having served on the  Government  Reform  and  Oversight  Committee, we actually passed  this  bill. I opposed it in committee on constitutional grounds. I offered amendments to actually fix what I feel are  constitutional problems in this legislation, and there are constitutional ways  to achieve what my colleague, the Delegate from the District of Columbia,  seeks to do.  There are constitutional ways to do  that. Just as in the 19th century, the  part of the District of Columbia that  was part of Virginia was ceded back to  the State of Virginia;  likewise,  the  part of the District of Columbia that  was Maryland could be ceded back for  representation purposes to the State of  Maryland. So there are constitutional  ways  to achieve what  the Delegate  seeks to achieve.  But the Constitution clearly provides  how Congressmen and Senators are allocated, and they are allocated to the  States. The District of Columbia was  provided for. The District of Columbia  is a Federal city and it is not a State.  Presently, D.C. has a Delegate who  votes  in committee. Actually, under  the new Democrat rules, they also vote  here on this House floor. I believe that  is unconstitutional as well. But what  this bill does is allow the District of  Columbia to keep that Delegate vote  and supplement it with another vote.  Now, what I would submit is that the  new Democrat majority  is trying to  pad their numbers on this House floor.  That is why they gave Democrats who  are nonvoting Members of this body  the ability to vote on the House floor.  That is also why, I submit, that this  Democrat majority is submitting this  bill for approval on this House floor,  and keeping not only  the Delegate  vote, but adding another Democrat  vote to this House floor.  I don’t oppose it for personal reasons.  I oppose this legislation for constitutional reasons, and I would submit to  the Delegate from the District of Columbia that we all must make a judgment on the constitutionality of legislation that we see before us on the  House floor, and in that way, we must  be constitutional scholars and study it.  So, beyond that,  let’s think about  what  the Democrats are doing, Mr.  Speaker. They are looking for a raw  power grab. They not only want to add  another seat in Democrat hands to this  body, but they want to allow nonvoting  delegates the ability to vote on this  House floor. I think that is wrong and  unconstitutional,  and  I  think  the  American people need to understand  what is happening here. It is a raw  power grab by the new Democrat majority.  b1145  Now, I think there are a lot of valid  reasons for us to look at ways to allow  the people in the District of Columbia  to vote for Congress and for Senate,  and I think the way to do that is to  cede that part of Maryland that is now  the District of Columbia back to the  State of Maryland for voting purposes.  And if they truly seek to do what they  seek to do today, they could propose a  constitutional amendment which has  previously been rejected. I urge us to  vote down this rule.  ",2007
865,12,2007-04-19,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, at this  time I yield, with Mr. ARCURI’s concurrence, 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. PRICE).  ",2007
866,12,2007-04-19,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank the gentleman for yielding. And  I am opposed to this rule for specific  reasons about the process and about  the unique and unheard of change that  would state that if a recommital motion passes, that that is laid upon the  table. That strips completely the authority of the minority to have input  into the process. And I would think,  Mr. Speaker, that Members of the majority party would be ashamed. I would  think that that would be the appropriate course of action, and that they  ought to rethink what they are doing.  But I came down to the floor to talk  about the substance of the bill, because  I believe passionately  in representation. I believe passionately in the importance of members, of citizens, residents of the District of Columbia to  have representation, voting representation in this House. I believe passionately in the Constitution. And I believe  that those two beliefs are not mutually  exclusive.  There is a particularly appropriate  way to proceed, and that is through the  issue of  retrocession, which as you  know, Mr. Speaker, provides that that  portion of the District of Columbia  that has residents in it, citizens in it,  could be moved back into the State of  Maryland and thereby obtain appropriate representation.  Mr. Speaker, I know that facts are  troubling things, and the supreme law  of our land, the Constitution, requires  us to do certain things and one of them  is to follow the Constitution.  Article I, section 2 of the Constitution states: ‘‘The House of Representatives shall be composed of members  chosen every second year by the people  of the several States.’’ It doesn’t say,  and the District of Columbia. It says:  the people of the several States.’’  Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that  that, along with the next paragraph  which states: ‘‘No person shall be a representative who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State in  which he shall be chosen.’’ It is clear  that this action will be unconstitutional if it moves forward.  Even Peter Rodino,  former Democratic Chair of  the Judiciary Committee in the 95th Congress, when confronted with this issue said:  ‘‘If the  citizens of a district are to have a voting representation in Congress, a constitutional  amendment  is  essential.  Statutory action alone will not suffice.’’  So, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that this  action that is being proposed by the  majority party  is  indeed unconstitutional, and I would agree with the delegate  from  the District of Columbia  that there is a body in our system of  government that will determine that.  That  is the  judiciary branch.  I am  hopeful that it will occur rapidly.  And I would be happy to yield to the  delegate from the District of Columbia  to see whether or not she would support, along with this, a demand for an  expedited review of this legislation and  would it move forward.  ",2007

868,12,2007-04-19,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Reclaiming  my time, I thank the gentlelady for  supporting it because I think that is  important. I think it is important that  if this in fact moves forward, I am not  certain that it will move through the  other body, but if it does move forward,  that it gets the expedited review that  is so imperative for our Constitution to  be followed appropriately.

I believe this bill to be unconstitutional. I  also believe that others may have a different perspective, and  I appreciate  that, and that the place to decide that  is in the court. And I would hope that  we would have an expedited review.  ",2007

Ladies and gentlemen, we have here a  very  interesting constitutional question. My good friend and distinguished  member of the Judiciary Committee I  think  has  raised  four, maybe  five  points that disturb him greatly, but  the main one is that it is unconstitutional. The point of the matter is that  there are those who think it is constitutional and those who think it is  unconstitutional.  Can’t we  let  the  courts decide this besides 435 great lawyers working on this?  Mr. Speaker, I now yield 3 minutes to  the distinguished gentleman from Alabama, ",2007
876,19,2007-04-19,Mr. ARTURDAVIS.,  ,2007
877,19,2007-04-19,Mr. DAVIS of Alabama.," Mr. Speaker,  I thank the distinguished Chair of the  committee for honoring me by giving  me a chance to speak during this momentous debate.  And I want to begin with a simple observation. If you scour the globe and  you look at the places that are listed  as democracies, the places where the  consent of the governed is what drives  the politics, there is not a single one  where the people who live in the capital do not have a representative to  their parliamentary body. No, not one.  That is telling, and it ought to frame  everything that we say here today because the system of government in this  country and the way we have gone  about business until now has been  unique in the world. This is the only  place in the world where the people  who live in the capital have no voice.  Now, let me speak to some of the  constitutional  arguments  that  have  been raised. I find it very telling, Mr.  Speaker, that many of my very able  colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have spent a lot of time in their recommit motion and other places, making a  point about the recent D.C. Circuit ruling about the right to bear arms. They  have brought that unrelated issue into  this debate.  But it is interesting for this reason,  and I take out this dog-eared copy of  the Constitution. If there is one document that ought to be well worn, I suppose it is the Constitution.  If you  look at the second amendment, Mr. Speaker and Mr. Chairman,  that our opponents in this debate rely  on, it says ‘‘A well regulated militia  being necessary to the security of a  free State, the right of the People to  keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,’’ a clear-cut reference to the  security of a free State.  Our friends on the other side of the  aisle say that  is relevant to Washington, D.C. They say there is a right  to bear arms  that  the people  shall  enjoy. If it is so in the context of someone carrying around a 9 millimeter or a  semiautomatic, it must be so in the  context of people walking into a ballot  and voting for a delegate who is a representative who has a voice here.  What kind of a system of government  says that the right to have a 9 millimeter outweighs the right to vote? You  can’t have it both ways in this argument. You can’t say you throw out the  State in the second amendment, but  somehow you make the State giant and  bold and capitalized and italicized in  the context of this representation.  Another  point  that Mr. NADLER  touched upon: We hear from the opposition that D.C. is a special thing, a Federal district, that  it  is neither the  United States nor the States so, therefore, it belongs in its own special category. If that is the case, to my friends  on the other side, take out your copy  of the Constitution, plow your way  through  it, and  look at amendment  after amendment. If that  interpretation is so, that D.C. is not a State or  the U.S. Government,  it means  the  equal protection clause doesn’t apply  to Washington, D.C. It means that the  antipoll tax provision doesn’t apply to  Washington, D.C. It means that every  other provision of  the Constitution  that  contains  the word  ‘‘State’’ or  ‘‘U.S.’’ does not apply.  No one makes that argument that  the people of Washington, D.C. are utterly shorn of rights because they are  neither a State nor the United States.  If you don’t make it in another context, you cannot make it in this one.  ",2007
878,19,2007-04-19,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself 30 seconds to respond to  the gentleman from Alabama.  The second amendment to the Constitution refers to the ‘‘State.’’ When  the  Constitution  refers  to  the  ‘‘States,’’ meaning  today  50 States,  then 13 States, it is referring to them  in the plural. The ‘‘State’’ in the second amendment refers to the country  collectively.  And to the distinguished chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, for whom I  have great respect but also great disagreement on this issue, I hope that  given the fact that we do acknowledge  a difference of opinion on what the  Constitution says means that he will  join with us in seeking for expedited  judicial review if, as I hope is not the  case, this should be passed and sent to  the courts for their review.  Mr. Speaker,  at  this  time  I  am  pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey  (Mr. GARRETT).  Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr.  Speaker, before I begin to set forth my  opposition to this piece of legislation,  let me refer back to the comments  made by the previous speaker, which  looked back over 150 years to try to  find a case to provide some substantiation for their argument, and they  did so by finding a case with regard to  judicial intervention.  In that case they cited that the Supreme Court held that this Congress  could allow or broaden the judicial authority,  if you will, of the Federal  courts. I think their example, in essence, proves too much. You cannot  simply take one sentence or two sentences out of the U.S. Constitution and  draw a conclusion from that. What you  have to do is read the entirety of the  Constitution.  If you had done that, you would realize that the courts have always held,  and the Founders’ intent always was,  that this body, this House, and this  Congress has broad  latitude when  it  comes to judicial issues and reining in  the Federal courts or expanding their  authority of jurisdiction. And that is  all that that Supreme Court case was  doing. It was not addressing the issue  of infringing upon the rights of other  citizens  by what  is  occurring here  today by granting more authority to  other States as far as voting is concerned.  More to the point on this legislation.  As I said before, I rise in strong opposition to this legislation because it is, A,  unconstitutional, and, B, unfair. It violates the Constitution and the very  fundamental  intent of the Founding  Fathers of this country and the Framers of the Constitution. It would give  the District, which is by no definition  a State, a vote in this House and simultaneously the citizens of another State  two Representatives, which is unfair to  the State of New Jersey and all States  in this country.  Furthermore, by allowing, unfairly,  the District of Columbia to have their  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:24 May 13, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD07\H19AP7.REC H19AP7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2007

880,26,2007-04-19,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. Speaker, we had distinguished speakers on both sides of  this issue argue the constitutionality  in the Judiciary Committee, both conservative and liberal members on each  side, and they both gave arguments it  was constitutional.  In baseball, the tie goes to the runner, and it goes to the runner because  the runner is trying to make an advancement, trying to score, trying to  make progress. And I would submit,  Mr. Speaker, that this is progress. This  is an advancement to allow the enfranchisement of these people who have  been denied the vote and their ancestors for many years. The tie should go  to the runner, we should pass this bill,  and I am proud to vote for it today.  ",2007
881,26,2007-04-19,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker, at  this time I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  POE).  ",2007
882,26,2007-04-19,Mr. POE.," Mr. Speaker, I appreciate  the opportunity and the time to make  some brief comments on this legislation.  The debate has been, as said previously, lively and very good. And it is  good that we are actually having a bill  presented to this Congress where the  issue is whether it is constitutional or  not. Too often this House seems to run  through  legislation. A  lot  is mentioned, a lot is said on this House floor,  but the issue of whether it stands muster with our Constitution is not said.  For the last 30 years, I have been in  the legal profession, 8 years as a trial  lawyer and 22 years as a trial judge in  the State of Texas. And the issue always in court, especially in criminal  cases, is: Is it constitutional what occurs in that courtroom? That is always  the question of the day. And I think  that is the question of today as well.  I respect the remarks of the majority  leader on his comments about how important it is for the folks in Washington, D.C. to have the right to vote  for a Member of Congress. I couldn’t  agree with him more. It is the moral  decision as well as an appropriate decision for us to make, at some time.  But under this current piece of legislation, it is not constitutional, unless  we want to take the word ‘‘state’’ in  the U.S. Constitution and change it to  something else. Now, that does happen  with the Supreme Court from time to  time; they give a new definition to the  word. I don’t know if they will give a  new definition to the word ‘‘state’’ and  apply it to the State of D.C. or not. We  shall see, probably, if this legislation  passes.  But I think the better avenue would  be to file a constitutional amendment.  No question about it. A constitutional  amendment cannot be ruled unconstitutional even by our Supreme Court.  And I think that is the better way to  proceed. I think this piece of legislation for the reasons stated by many  people  is  unconstitutional  and  it  should not pass.  Let’s do it the right way, the proper  way, and of course the moral way: file  a constitutional amendment.  ",2007

885,26,2007-04-19,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise in strong support of the District of  Columbia’s Voting Rights Act. As  chairman of the Subcommittee on the  Federal Workforce Postal and the District of Columbia, I have listened closely to the debate, and I am firmly and  thoroughly convinced that every procedural concern has been met, every rationalization has been met with logic,  and every constitutional question has  withstood its challenges.  The only question before us now is: If  not now, then when? If not us, then  who?  The real deal is that the people of the  District of Columbia have waited far  too long. Justice delayed is justice denied. We must correct this  injustice  and do it today. I urge passage of this  legislation.  ",2007
886,26,2007-04-19,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker,  it  is  now time for us to hear the Delegate  from the District of Columbia. I am  honored to yield to ELEANORHOLMES  NORTON5 minutes.  ",2007
887,26,2007-04-19,Ms. NORTON.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the distinguished chairman for yielding and for his ceaseless fight for the  District’s rights. During the rule,  I  thanked the many others who are responsible for this historic day.  Today’s vote will allow the House to  erase many deep historic wrongs from  the Nation’s conscience. As the House  votes, District’s residents are serving  in Iraq and Afghanistan in a shooting  war, as they have in every war, including the war that established our Republic.  Andy Shallal, a District  resident,  said it best: ‘‘People like me of Iraqi  ancestry and even my son, who was  born in the United States, are entitled  to vote in Iraq elections due in large  part to the service of the citizens of the  District of Columbia and other Ameriin  fought and died  cans who have  Iraq.’’  And today’s vote will erase the slander that the Founders of our country  who staged the revolution for representation would then deny it to the residents of their own capital.  Professor  Viet  Dinh,  President  Bush’s former point man on constitutional matters, has wiped away the  major argument that because the District is not a State its American citizens cannot vote in the people’s House,  by detailing the many ways in which  ‘‘since 1805 the Supreme Court has recognized that Congress has the authority to treat the District as a State, and  Congress has repeatedly exercised that  authority.’’ My  favorite  is  the  sixteenth  amendment,  which  requires  only that citizens of States pay Federal income taxes. Why then have District residents continuously been taxed  without representation?  And  today’s vote will  relieve  the  House of the shameful racial burden  that has been at the core of the denial  of the rights of D.C. citizens. Congress  required the same racial segregation  here as  in  the Southern States,  in  schools and in public accommodations,  until the 1954 Brown decision. As one  Southern Senator put it: ‘‘The Negroes  flocked in, and there was only one way  out, and that was to deny suffrage entirely to every human being in the district.’’  Former Republican Senator Edward  Brooke, a native Washingtonian and  the Nation’s  first popularly  elected  black Senator, wrote: ‘‘The experience  of living in a segregated city and of  serving in our segregated Army perhaps explains why my party’s work on  the Voting Rights Act reauthorization  last year and on  the pending D.C.  House Voting Rights Act has been so  important to me personally. The irony,  of course, is that I had to leave my  hometown  to  get  representation  in  Congress and to become a Member.’’  Today, I ask the House to abolish  that  irony and the tragedy  for the  many who have come to the Nation’s  Capital seeking freedom for 206 years,  among  them my great grandfather,  Richard Holmes, a slave who ran away  from a Virginia plantation in the 1850s  and settled our family here. I appeal to  your conscience and ask for your vote  so that finally there also will be a vote  for your  fellow Americans here who  have paid for this precious right many  times over in blood and in treasure.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",2007
888,26,2007-04-19,Mr. GOODLATTE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  yield myself the balance of the time  and simply say that I think this has  been an excellent debate. I think there  is good faith on both sides. But I do believe very, very strongly, as do I think  many, many other people, that this is  the wrong way to go about correcting  the lack of a vote for residents of the  District of Columbia, which the other  side has clearly pointed out should be  corrected. But there are correct ways  to do it.

I simply want to rise to say that the  bill that just passed, which I actually  supported because I think it was the  right thing to do constitutionally, and  just  good  government,  it  violated  PAYGO for 2 hours. So what we have  here is a too-cute-by-half PAYGO fix.  And it is my hope that when the majority brings new bills to the floor that  the bills themselves will be fixed with  respect to PAYGO.  This rule tactic that  is being deployed, I think, denied the minority  rights to have the kinds of motions to  recommit that the minority traditionally has been given.  But more importantly, this really is  a violation of PAYGO. It is fixed now  because it was broken just a minute  ago. It is a half-hearted attempt for the  majority to submit to their own rules.  The PAYGO principle of pay-as-you-go  ought to apply every minute, every  second, every hour. If you believe in it,  don’t make it just apply for 2 hours  and then bring it back an hour later  just because you want to deny the minority an ability to have an effective  motion to recommit.  I would be happy to yield to the leader.  ",2007

If my memory serves  me, having served on the Ways and  Means at the time that bill was written, all tax bills which originate in the  Ways and Means Committee  in  the  House were permanent.  It was  the  Democrat Party  in the Senate that  made it temporary, that put in, because of a cloture vote, put the temporary nature of the tax cuts in. The  tax cuts sunset in 2012 because of the  Byrd rule and because we did not have  sufficient numbers of  the Democrat  Party at the time vote for cloture so  that we could make these tax cuts permanent.

902,33,2007-04-19,Mr. HILL.," Mr. Speaker, I would like  to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished majority leader.  Mr. Leader, the minority side has  been talking about PAYGO rules and  that somehow we have violated them.  They sound very convincing. And as  you know,  the  fiscally conservative  Blue Dog Coalition are also strong supporters of the PAYGO rule, as are all  members of our Democratic Caucus.  This pay-as-you-go rule was an important step in restoring fiscal discipline  in Congress. The Members of the Blue  Dog Coalition believe it is important  that the House comply with this rule.  Can you explain how this bill complies with PAYGO and specifically, for  the benefit of the Members on both  sides, I ask, will the PAYGO rule that  we established in January be fulfilled  when the House completes action on  the District of Columbia Voting Rights  Act?  ",2007
903,33,2007-04-19,Mr. HOYER., If the gentleman will  yield.  ,2007
904,33,2007-04-19,Mr. HILL., I will yield.  ,2007
905,33,2007-04-19,Mr. HOYER.," I thank the gentleman  for his question. It  is an  important  question. And the answer to that question is, absolutely. And I am glad that  we have this opportunity to clear up  any confusion. I want to assure the  gentleman, and all Members of  the  House, that the District of Columbia  Voting Rights Act will not violate  PAYGO, period. The House just voted  to approve the D.C. Voting Rights Act  of 2007. We have now proceeded to consideration of H.R. 1906, which amends  provisions  of  the  Internal Revenue  Code regarding estimated taxes to pay  for all costs attendant within the D.C.  House Voting Rights Act.  b1500  While those costs are de minimis, essentially about $1.6 million out of $27  trillion if there is no escalation in government  revenues,  notwithstanding  that, we wanted  to  adhere  to  the  PAYGO rule, as the gentleman from Indiana has stated and for which he has  fought so hard and been a leader on.  The rule provides that the text of H.R.  1906 will be incorporated into the D.C.  Voting Rights Act when H.R. 1906 is  passed; in other words, every Member  who voted for the rule voted to honor  PAYGO.  The Congressional Budget Office and  the Budget Committee have certified  that when the text of H.R. 1906 is incorporated into the bill and the bill is engrossed, the bill will comply with the  PAYGO rule. The rule further provides  that if either bill fails to pass, both  bills will be tabled. In other words, if  the bill providing the offset to ensure  compliance with PAYGO is not added  to the bill, the D.C. bill would be rejected.  This process guarantees that two important things will happen, first, that  an unmitigated injustice, the denial of  voting for the citizens of the District of  Columbia, is considered on its merits  and remedied; and secondly, that we  abide by our commitment to PAYGO.  Again I state, the gentleman from Indiana has been an extraordinarily consistent and strong leader on behalf of  that premise.  The House, in conclusion, will not  send a bill that does not comply with  the PAYGO rule as a result of the rule.

And we have  seen the mistakes and the errors of our  ways in Katrina. Mr. BAKERcan speak  to what he has gone through in Louisiana. We need not repeat those errors.  So here we have in this legislation an  opportunity to help her and 299 other  districts. I wish it was 435. So it has  been put together in a bipartisan way.  And finally, on my effort, I tried to  do it in a transparent way. All of the  Republican projects have been on file,  open to the public, and any of the earmarks, open to public and press scrutiny. So I have tried to do it in a manner that restores public faith, because I  would rather have elected Members of  Congress make those decisions, fight  for them, and have it done and conducted in a transparent fashion rather  than have some bureaucrat down there  decide where  the  taxpayer money,  which  they  just  paid  in  in  huge  amounts over the past week to Washington, get expended.

I join him in his statement  on the administration’s statement of  policy. I think they have it wrong, and  the gentleman stated it just right.  Over  the past  6 years,  if we had  passed the water resources bill  in a  timely fashion, it would have been in  the range of $2 billion a year. That is  normal. So what we are dealing with is  a huge, pent-up backlog.  Again, as the gentleman said, this is  an investment in America, and Members  of Congress  representing  their  constituents,  their  businesses,  their  water resources, know what they need.  They have come forward with thoughtful recommendations, and this bill reflects those recommendations.  We have served as a filter to weed out  those in our best judgment that did not  measure up on cost-benefit analysis. So  we have set a standard for the future  and we have, in accordance with the  rules of the House, made all of the  Member projects available, and will  continue to do that.

Water resources legislation is most  effective when it is considered biennially.

And, unfortunately, no  water resources bill has been enacted  since 2000, the entire term of our current administration. This is a result, in  part, of a failure of the current administration to engage in this important  legislation, as well as a failure of the  Congress to reach agreement.

915,47,2007-04-19,Mr. EMANUEL.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today  in strong support of H.R. 1945, the Water Resources Development Act  (WRDA). As  the  Democratic Majority begins our second 100  days, we are continuing to move America forward, and WRDA does just that.  This bill will help commerce by  improving  navigation on waterways and making it easier  to bring products to market. This bill will invest  in our  future by modernizing  the  locks and  dams on the Mississippi River and elsewhere.  This bill will protect the Great Lakes by finally  making  the Asian Carp barrier permanent.  This bill  invests  in rural and urban America  alike by  renewing our commitment  to protecting the environment and the economy.  The Water Resources Development Act is a  good bill that has been written in a bipartisan  process  to address  the needs of  the whole  country, but there are two parts of the bill in  particular  that  I am especially proud are  included.  The locks on the Mississippi River and Illinois Waterways are  in need of  repair, and  WRDA  finally addresses  the  long overdue  need for lock modernization. Navigation in the  upper Mississippi supports more than 400,000  jobs and 90,000 high-paying manufacturing  jobs, and passage of WRDA will create more  jobs in the region. Every year, shipping in the  upper Mississippi River adds up to about $1.2  billion to our economy. Modernizing the locks  will go a long way to ensuring the livelihoods  of the men and women that rely on these waterways.  Another project in WRDA that is critical to  the Great Lakes and important to all of Chicago is the Asian Carp barrier. As the residents of the Fifth Congressional District know,  invasive species pose a severe threat to Lake  Michigan, capable of billions of dollars in economic  losses and  inestimable environmental  damage.  The Asian Carp  in particular has affected  Great Lakes fisheries, and I have been working with my Great Lakes colleagues in making  sure that this barrier is funded and operational  to protect the Great Lakes from Asian Carp.  Mr. Chairman, the Water Resources Development Act is a hat trick—it’s good for the environment, it’s good for the economy, and it’s  good for America’s future. I want to thank Mr.  OBERSTARand Mr. MICA for all of their good  work, and I am glad that we are getting this  bill done. I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2007

917,96,2007-04-19,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Chairman, I offer  an amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amendment No. 4 offered by Mr. STUPAK:  Page 116, after line 8, insert the following  (and conform the table of contents of the bill  accordingly):  SEC. 2041. CRITERIA FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF HARBOR DREDGING  PROJECTS.  The Secretary shall budget and request appropriations for operation and maintenance  of harbor dredging projects based only upon  criteria used for such projects in fiscal year  2004 and shall not use a budget standard for  such projects based on the amount of tonnage a harbor handles.  The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House  Resolution  319,  the gentleman  from  Michigan (Mr. STUPAK) and a Member  opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Michigan.  ",2007
918,96,2007-04-19,Mr. STUPAK.," Mr. Chairman, in fiscal  year 2006, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Office of Management  and Budget  set new  guidelines  for  maintenance dredging of commercial  harbors in their budget for fiscal year  2006. The Corps excluded harbors that  move less than 1 million tons of cargo  each year.  The House  is on  record  that  the  Corps’ neglect of these harbors is unwise and unreasonable. With Members’  help during consideration of WRDA,  the Stupak-Hoekstra-Delahunt amendment to prohibit the Corps from using  a tonnage-based standard was included  in the House bill by voice vote.  Now the Corps is back with a similar  tonnage-based  formula. This  formula  essentially credits $2 for maintenance  dredging  for  every  ton  of  product  moved. The harbor  is then provided  only the amount from the formula, regardless of the actual cost to dredge a  harbor. This policy not only discriminates against rural America by significantly limiting dredging of harbors in  smaller communities, but it is pound  wise and penny foolish.  For example, under the Corps proposal, my harbor in Ontonogan, Michigan, will move just over 300,000 tons of  material,  so  the Corps will provide  $643,000 worth of maintenance dredging, even though its dredging cost is  more than $1 million.  Again, there are almost 300 harbors  across this country that face the same  problem. Our small harbors will never  be able to adequately dredge, but will  silt in with each passing year. Thus,  pound wise, penny foolish.  These Corps guidelines will have a  detrimental effect on small-town, rural  America, causing job losses, increased  hardship for business, and endanger our  Nation’s entire shipping infrastructure.  Each harbor  that has been maintained by  the Corps  for years has  unique characteristics other than just  the amount of tonnage it moves. For  example, annual dredging helps prevent flooding in Ontonogan, and dredging plays an essential  role  in preserving the economy and  lifeline of  this harbor town. By only considering  the amount of tonnage a harbor handles, the administration  ignores the  benefits provided  to businesses and  residents that depend on electricity,  flood mitigation and other purposes beyond the tonnage handled.  With this new policy, the Corps also  disregards the fact that approximately  two-thirds of all shipping in the United  States either starts or finishes at a  small port. By  ignoring the smaller  communities, the Corps is also significantly harming the Nation’s economy.  With  the Corps’ proposed maintenance dredging guidelines, in each year  our  small harbors’ maintenance  remains uncertain. Without this Stupak-  Hoekstra-Delahunt  amendment,  the  economic vitality and the dream of  economic expansion for these 300 communities remain uncertain.  As the House considers this WRDA  legislation, I am again offering this  amendment with Congressmen Hoekstra and Delahunt, which keeps the  maintenance dredging the same as it  has been before the Corps and OMB  came up with these tonnage proposals.  For the sake of our Nation’s small  harbors, from which two-thirds of all  shipping in the United States either  starts or finishes at small ports, I encourage my colleagues to adopt our  amendment, which would ensure that  all harbor maintenance is funded fairly, regardless of the amount of tonnage  a harbor handles.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2007
919,96,2007-04-19,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Mr. Chairman, I ask  unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition to the amendment, although I do not oppose the amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection  to the request of the gentleman from  Minnesota?  ",2007
920,96,2007-04-19,Mr. BAKER.," Reserving the right to  object, if I may make an inquiry of the  gentleman, we have a cosponsor on our  side of the amendment. Will the gentleman be happy to yield?  ",2007

923,96,2007-04-19,Mr. OBERSTAR.,"  In  the preceding  Congress, this amendment was offered  on the floor during consideration of the  WRDA bill, and it passed by voice vote;  WRDA passed by 406 votes. It requires  adequate budgeting by the administration for maintenance of small, low-use  harbors. These are relatively smaller  harbors; they may not handle thousands of containers or millions of tons  of bulk commodities shipped on the  Great Lakes, as we do in the Harbor of  Duluth,  but  they  are  important  projects and facilities that place lives  and livelihoods at risk on the fierce  storms of the Great Lakes, because  these are also harbors of refuge. So I  strongly support it.  Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield to  the  gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr.  HOEKSTRA).  ",2007
924,96,2007-04-19,Mr. HOEKSTRA.,"  I thank my colleague for yielding and I am thankful  for his support and help on this amendment.  I would also like to thank my colleague from Michigan for bringing this  amendment together. I think we both  recognize  the  importance  of  this  amendment. My congressional district,  I think we kind of represent God’s  country. I represent about 200 miles of  Lake Michigan shoreline. I don’t think  I want to get into an argument with  my colleague from Michigan as to how  much shoreline he represents from the  Great Lakes, but it is well in excess of  that number.  But we both have recognized that the  current Corps guidelines present a distinct hardship  to our  communities,  many of the communities along the  Great Lakes. We don’t meet the newest  guidelines that establish the roughly 1  million tons or whatever of cargo that  need to flow through a harbor. And this  is a change in the Corps’ position. For  the last 14 years that my colleague and  I have been in Congress, the Corps has  done a very, very good job and recognized its responsibility for taking care  of these small and medium-sized harbors  which  they  classify  as  recreational harbors.  But they are much more than recreational harbors. For many of our  communities they do, we do transfer  cargo through these ports, but the harbors form the economic development  zone for these communities. And if the  harbors  and  the  channels  are  not  dredged,  this economic  lifeline goes  away. And when the economic lifeline  goes away, eventually these communities go away.  This is a policy that Congress needs  to  address  because,  from  a  disappointing standpoint, the administration has made an administrative decision that these harbors will not be  taken care of. Congress needs to speak  on this issue. I am glad that we can  move this forward in a bipartisan basis  and send a piece of legislation to the  administration that no longer provides  them with the latitude as to whether  these harbors will be dredged or not.  These harbors need to be dredged. They  will be dredged. This is exactly the appropriate message to send.  I thank my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle for taking the initiative  in bringing this  legislation  forward.  ",2007
925,96,2007-04-19,Mr. OBERSTAR.," I thank the gentleman  from Michigan  for his statement.

930,103,2007-04-19,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  In doing so, I rise to offer a very simple, straightforward motion to instruct  conferees on the fiscal year 2007 emergency  supplemental  appropriations  bill.  The motion to instruct simply insists  that House conferees support the previously adopted House position with regard to a timetable for the withdrawal  of troops from Iraq. This motion, which  I will oppose, puts Members on record  as either fully supporting our troops or  agreeing to a surrender date in Iraq. It  is that simple.  It is no secret that many Members of  the  House,  both  Republicans  and  Democrats, have  strong  reservations  about the manner in which this legislation undermines the authority of the  President, our  commander  in  chief.  Members are also  rightly concerned  about how this legislation places military decisions in the hands of politicians rather than the military commanders in the field.  This legislation ought to focus on our  troops. It ought to focus on providing  those in harm’s way with the resources  they need to complete their mission  successfully. It ought to respect, not  micromanage,  our  combatant  commanders in whom we place the ultimate  responsibility  for  prosecuting  military actions.  Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress  are many things. We are elected to represent the interests of our constituents  from our congressional districts. However, as presently written, this legislation makes the dangerous assumption  that Congress  also  has  an  on-the-  ground role in prosecuting the war in  Iraq.  In closing, let me remind my colleagues of this: We are not generals. We  are not the Secretary of State. And we  are most certainly not the commander  in chief.

As a  representative of  the  international community, the United Nations must be the leading voice against  genocide. That includes all genocides,  including the Armenian genocide. Unless the United Nations takes a stand  against Turkey’s denial, its value to  the international community is greatly  undermined.  As the 92nd anniversary of the Armenian genocide approaches, Turkey’s recent behavior is yet another example of  why it is so important for Congress to  reaffirm  the Armenian genocide by  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:24 May 13, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00110 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD07\H19AP7.REC H19AP7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2007

At this time, I do want to ask Mr.  KLEIN to sort of pick up a little bit  where Congressman MURPHY left off.  What did this Congress do to make  America safer? Could you share that  with us?  ",2007
942,117,2007-04-19,Mr. KLEIN of Florida.," Sure. I listened to Congressman MURPHY, and I  listened to veterans in my home district of Broward and Palm Beach Counties, and whether it was World War II,  the Korean War or the most recent  conflicts we are involved in, these are  brave men and women that put their  lives on the line, and they deserve to be  supported, both on  the ground and  when they come home.  I thank you for your service, and I  certainly thank your colleagues over in  Iraq and the men and women that are  fighting and protecting our freedoms  all over the world.  b2145  You know, when I think about September 11, which was a dark day for  our country, and what happened in our  country with the failures that allowed  these terrorists to attack us, and the  deaths, the needless deaths that occurred in our major cities, it was an  awakening for this country. But it was  also a time when we had an opportunity to really take stock of where  our shortcomings were. Where were the  intelligence failures? Where were the  communication  failures? Where were  the vulnerabilities in our airports and  our seaports and all these other places  where people came in from other countries to harm us and kill our people in  this country?  And there was a man named Osama  bin Laden who is still out there. Hard  to believe today. When you think about  what our number one strategy should  have been was to find the perpetrator  and the perpetrators of this terrible,  terrible tragedy, and he  is still out  there today. That needs to be rectified.  But beyond that, I think we all recognize things that came together after  that; and there was this 9/11 Commission report, which was probably one of  the most prestigious, important, qualified  incredible groups that came together, Democrats, Republicans, professionals which said, let’s figure this  out. This isn’t a Democrat/Republican  issue; it is an American issue, and protecting our territory, our homes, our  streets. And they came up with this 9/  11 report. Which, if you haven’t had a  chance to take a look at it, it is not  just reading you read before you go to  bed and it will put you to sleep. This is  gripping. This is really a very thorough  analysis of what we need to do.  Unfortunately, it was a number of  years that passed. Some things were  adopted from that plan, but many were  not. And I don’t think it was anybody  questioning the fact that this was a  priority, but it wasn’t passed. Many of  the items weren’t passed.  So one of the things that we said in  our campaigns and we took up right  away, and we are still obviously waiting for the process in Washington to be  finished, but the House quickly took up  the rest of the 9/11 Commission report  and passed it. And I just want to highlight a few key elements.  We know that there were problems  with  aviation  security. Those  elements,  those  recommendations have  been adopted. We know that there were  port problems and port security issues.  Most containers that come in, substantially most of the containers that come  into our ports are not inspected. I come  from southeast Florida. We have Port  of Palm Beach and Port Everglades.  Port Everglades is a main oil terminal  among cargo and container  in great  bulk. Tremendous risk if you happen to  be  anywhere near  those  areas  and  something, God forbid, comes in in the  form of nuclear materials or biohazardous materials or anything else that  comes into those ports. And this is all  over the United States. Ownership of  the ports. We all know about the Dubai  Port issue. That has been straightened  out through our legislation.  Certainly the idea of preventing terrorists  from even getting  into  this  country, visa changes, rules changes,  all these things are so important. And  not to mention the people that are on  the ground fighting for us every day,  our  firefighters,  our  emergency  responders, our police officers. Every one  of us feels very strongly about them.  And as we grew up and you wanted to  be a fireman or you wanted to be a policeman, not everybody chose that profession, but, boy, on September 11 did  we as Americans have a newfound respect for what they did for us.  But what we needed to do that wasn’t  done was to give them the tools, the  communications tools like they needed  in New York and other places so they  can make sure that they can communicate with each other, and that local  and State and National Federal intelligence agencies  can properly  share  that  information. These things have  now been passed by the House of Representatives, and it was one of the first  things we did. And that is the right  thing to do. And whatever it costs, that  should be at the top of our budget. People say, well, it is expensive. You know  something? You prioritize. You say,  what is first? Homeland security, protecting our troops, making sure they  are properly funded. And I know that  Congressman YARMUTHis going to talk  about the  incredible great work we  have done for our veterans.  These are the things that are our Nation’s priorities.

944,124,2007-04-19,Mr. WALBERG.," You raised a  good point. It has only been 100 days,  and in less than 100 days, the largest  tax  increase  in America has  taken  place.  During the campaign, you heard from  both parties, you heard what people  said they would do. In less than 100  days, they were broken.  If you happen to be sitting at home  and you are married, you have some  children, you are going to pay more. If  you are elderly, you are going to pay  more. If you happen to maybe seek the  opportunity of America, worked hard,  made a business, saved, bought some  land and went forward, you happened  to pass away, this majority party, the  Democrats, want to take 55 percent of  that. That is the difference.  I appreciate your principled view, let  people keep their hard-earned money,  and make sure that you bring accountability back.  Now we want to go to another place  in middle America because  that  is  where solutions are. We want to get an  update from Ohio. In Ohio, you can find  a lot of individuals, but you can’t find  someone who works harder. Congressman JIMJORDAN, along with his wife,  Polly; I think they hold the American  dream.  b2245  They are doing a fantastic job of raising their own children. They reach out  into this community. They help others  and make sure they are able to have a  place to stay, a place a work and place  for education. But JIM, Congressman  JORDAN is the only Republican freshman to get placed on Judiciary. Why?  Because of his work, not only as an attorney, but his work in the Senate in  Ohio, that stood out across this Nation.  And I want you to give us an update.  Talk a little further more about taxes  and what this 100 days have meant to  America and how much this Democratic Party is going to reach into your  pocket.  ",2007
945,124,2007-04-19,Mr. JORDAN of Ohio.," Well, I thank  the gentleman for yielding some time  and for his work in putting this together and his passion and intensity  and energy that he brings to the Congress and what he has done  in our  freshman class.  I appreciate the remarks of  the previous  speaker. He  talked about Tax Day, and he is right  on target when you think about the  amount of money government takes.  And I just want to start with a question. And there is probably a few people watching, probably mostly in the  gentleman  from California’s district.  Most people in Ohio are smart enough  to get in bed at this hour. But there are  a few people watching out there. And I  just want to ask those Americans who  are watching, do you think government  has enough of your money already, or  do you think they need more? And my  guess is the vast majority of people in  California who are watching, or in Ohio  who are sleeping, understand that the  government, the billions and billions  and the trillions and trillions that the  government takes in already is probably enough.  And the gentleman  from Michigan  was great in outlining what is at stake  and what the Democrats want to do,  because the Democrats obviously think  different. The American people think,  you know what, the government probably takes enough of my money. But  based on what took place 2 weeks ago  with the budget that was passed by the  majority party, over the next 3 years  the spending they want to do is going  to take more and more money out of  the private sector, where good things  happen in our economy, where jobs are  created, where prosperity takes place,  more and more money out of the private sector and more money from the  families across this great country, in  Ohio, in the Fourth District, and across  the Nation as whole.  So I just want to provide some perspective and context and  framework  for why that is a bad thing. And I think  we just start with this basic premise:  the stakes are high today. It is important that the elected officials, the politicians here in Congress, get it right  for a change. There was a point in the  past where, in spite of bad policies that  the  politicians may  have  enacted,  America, because we were so uniquely  positioned coming out of World War II,  we were the economic superpower. We  were the economy that was growing. It  didn’t really matter if bad public policy was put in place. We were going to  excel. We were going to prosper in this  world market  in spite of the things  that the politicians might have done.  But today the stakes are high and  the competition is stiffer. And I just  want to give some facts and figures and  I will yield back to the gentleman from  California. But recognize the  framework we are in. Today, China has 1.4  billion people. India has close to 800  million people. Those two countries,  over two billion people. United States  of America, we just hit 300 million population last summer. Those two economies, China and India, over two billion  people combined  in those two countries, China’s economy is growing at  approximately  10  percent  annual  growth rate. India is growing at about  7,  71⁄2 percent  annual  growth  rate,  quickly moving towards middle class.  The competition is stiffer. And it is important today when you think about  those numbers, those facts, those figures, that we in elective office do the  policies right.  Raising  taxes on business owners,  raising taxes on families, $400 billion,  as  the  gentleman  from  California  pointed out, doing those things makes  it tougher for our families, our small  business owners, our economy to compete in that world market. And that is  why it is important we not go along  with these tax increases. That is why it  is important we try to keep those tax  cuts that are in place, so that family  and businesses can prosper. It is that  fundamental.  The  gentleman  from  Michigan was exactly right. And he  ticked off, he read off the tax increases  that will happen under the Democrats  budget plan. And it is important we  not go there.  I always come back to, you know, the  very first thing we did in this Congress,  the majority party,  the Democratic  Party  enacted  some PAYGO  rules,  which  sound great. But what  those  PAYGO rules did was make it easier to  raise taxes.  The last thing this Congress did before we went home for Easter break to  see our constituents and visit our districts, the last thing we did before we  went home for the Easter break was  raise taxes. So they started off the  Congress by making it easier to raise  taxes. The last thing we did before we  went home for break was raise taxes.  And so that should tell you what is at  stake here and why  it  is  important  that we fight for the American families,  like  the gentleman  from California has been doing, and it has been  a pleasure to serve along with him in  that regard. And I will yield back some  time and we can discuss some of this  maybe as we move along.  ANNOUNCEMENTBYTHESPEAKERPROTEMPORE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (",2007

947,124,2007-04-19,Mr. MCCARTHY of California.," Mr.  Speaker, one thing we know on this  floor, and you brought up a very good  point, Mr. Speaker, as we talk, we listen to other Members here, the largest  tax increase in American history happened within the last 100 days. And,  Mr. Speaker, when we think about is  America taxed enough, I simply, and I  think about  the average American,  they wake up in the morning and they  take a shower, they pay a tax on that  water.  They  maybe  stop  off  at  Starbucks or someone else, and get a  cup of coffee. They pay a tax on that  coffee. They stop off, fill their car up so  they can make it to work, drop their  children off at school, they pay a gasoline tax. They go to work, for the first  3 hours they are paying the Federal  and State tax. They go home, they turn  on the TV, maybe to watch a little C–  SPAN, Mr. Speaker,  if anybody at  home is watching this, they are paying  a cable tax.  Maybe their business says they have  got to get up and try to find more opportunity because the world is being  very competitive, so they have got to  get on a plane. They pay an airplane  tax. They rent a car. They pay a rental  tax. They stay at a hotel, they pay an  occupancy tax. Lo and behold, God forbid they get very successful and they  save some money, and they put it away  and they want to give their children,  their grandchildren some opportunity  for  the  future. This majority party  wants to take 55 percent of that.

955,138,2007-04-19,Mrs. LINCOLN.," Mr. President,  I  would like to take a few moments to  extend my heartfelt condolences to the  Virginia Tech community and the families comforting them. The entire Nation obviously is grieving with them  over their tremendous loss. We want  them to know that all of our States,  particularly the great State of Arkansas, stand with them as they cope with  this senseless tragedy. We will continue to be with them, keep them in  our thoughts and prayers in the coming weeks and months.  I attended Randolph-Macon Woman’s  College  just  down  the  road  from  Blacksburg  in Lynchburg, VA.  I remember when I was in college, Virginia  Tech was well known for its strong and  passionate student body. They had tremendous strength. They had a strong  will, a  strong determination, and a  strong and bright spirit. I certainly  know that all of those strengths remain in today’s student body at Virginia Tech.  I also know  that  their  alumni will be there to comfort them  and stead them well  in the coming  months. We hope they know we have  them in our thoughts and prayers.  f  WAR IN IRAQ  ",2007
956,138,2007-04-19,Mrs. LINCOLN.," Mr. President, news  from the Pentagon last week hit so  many  families throughout our great  State of Arkansas particularly hard.  Four years into the conflict in Iraq,  the Army National Guard put 13,000 reservists,  including nearly  2,000  from  the largest National Guard unit in Arkansas, the 39th Infantry Brigade, on  notice that they should be prepared for  a second deployment at the end of this  year. The Pentagon’s decision to potentially deploy these troops marks the  first time during Operation Iraqi Freedom that full Guard units would be  called up for a second tour of duty. Our  Arkansas  troops  already  have  performed bravely in Iraq, and we know  they will do so again.  Today, along with many Arkansans  honorably serving in the Active-Duty  military, over 1,600 of our citizen soldiers have been activated for service in  the Middle East and along our southern  border with Mexico. The 142nd Fire Brigade based in Fayetteville, AR, mobilized last week and is expected in Iraq  this summer. Eighty members of the  213th Area Support Medical Company  are preparing for their mobilization orders in June. Many of these members  served in Iraq before with the 296th  Ambulance  Company.  The  headquarters  company,  the  871st Troop  Command, is also expected to be mobilized in June.  Since the war began, our troops have  performed their mission with incredible bravery and skill in some of the  harshest conditions imaginable. Their  families have supported them and kept  them in their prayers, have been there  with them each step of the way, both  in the harsh conditions and when they  have returned. Their communities have  supported them, many of which are  rural communities. They are communities that, when these soldiers have  been deployed, have to find someone  else to  fill positions while they are  gone, positions such as mayor or principal of the school, fire chief or police  chief, small businesses that keep the  economies in those small rural communities thriving.  Because of  the  sacrifice of  these  brave men and women, their families,  and these communities, we have seen a  popularly elected government replace a  ruthless dictator.  We have seen a democratic constitution approved by the Iraqi people replace the authoritarian rule they had  known. Tragically, we also have seen  civilian mismanagement of this war  which is not reflective of the tremendous sacrifice put forth by our men and  women in uniform.

959,145,2007-04-19,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, we are  considering the court security bill. At  the moment, there is no one who wishes to speak on that legislation. I wish  to speak about the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is now holding a  hearing. I just finished testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee. I wish to talk about that testimony.  The  Armed  Services  Committee,  under  the  chairmanship  of Senator  CARLLEVIN, is holding a hearing this  morning on contracting abuses; that is,  contracting abuses in Iraq especially  under what is called the LOGCAP contract.  I  testified  that  I  chaired  in  the  Democratic Policy Committee,  over  the last 3 years, 10 hearings on these  issues of contract abuses. I suggested  to the Armed Services Committee that  they look into what is not only called  the LOGCAP, which is a logistic contract which, in this case, Halliburton,  or their subsidiary, KBR, provided certain logistics assistance to the Department of the Army under a contract  worth billions of dollars, I suggested  they also look into the RIO contract,  which is Restore Iraqi Oil contract.  I  pointed  out  to  them  that  the  woman who rose to become the highest  contract official in the U.S. Corps of  Engineers—she  rose  to  become  the  highest civilian contract official in the  Army Corps of Engineers—she said the  awarding of the RIO contract, the Restore Iraqi Oil contract—Restore Iraqi  Oil is what RIO stands for—to Halliburton and KBR was ‘‘the most blatant  contracting abuse I have seen in my  entire career.’’ This is from the top civilian contracting officer.  What happened to her? She paid for  that with her job. For that she was demoted. Before she said that publicly,  she was given outstanding evaluations  every year. Once she said publicly what  she had told them privately, and they  ignored, they began the process of giving her performance evaluations that  were inferior for demotion.  A couple of nights ago, I called the  general, now retired, who brought this  contracting officer in as the top civilian contracting officer. I said: What’s  the story?  He said: She has been dealt an awful  hand, and it has been very unfair to  her. She is a straight-shooter, she is  competent, she speaks the truth. The  fact is, she is paying for telling the  truth.  I suggested to the Armed Services  Committee that this woman, named  Bunnatine Greenhouse, who had the  courage  to  speak  out  against  contracting abuse, should be called to testify.  We ought to put a stop to this stuff  that when someone in the Federal Government speaks out and says there is  abuse  occurring,  the  taxpayers  are  being abused, the soldiers are being  disserved, that somehow they  injure  their career by telling the truth. But  let me go on.  I suggested the committee look into  the RIO contract.  I sent the  issues  raised by Bunnatine Greenhouse, who  paid for her honesty with her job: she  was demoted. I sent all that material  to  the  inspector general. Seventeen  months ago, I got a letter from the inspector general saying they received it,  they looked into all those allegations,  it has now been referred to the Justice  Department, it is for their action, and  because it is a criminal matter, they  would not comment further.  Obviously, they believed there was  something that was serious. That is the  RIO, the Restore Iraq Oil contract.  There is another contract, and that is  the purpose of the hearing this morning, the LOGCAP contract, once again,  given to Halliburton and their subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown  and Root.  What I told them this morning is what  I found in 10 hearings. I held up a white  towel, a white hand towel that most  would recognize. It hangs in the bathrooms in most homes.  A man named Henry Bunting came to  us. Henry Bunting was in Kuwait. He  was actually buying supplies for the  troops in Iraq. Henry Bunting was a  purchaser  for KBR  in Kuwait. They  said to Henry Bunting: Buy some towels for the troops. So Henry goes about  buying towels for the troops. But then  the supervisor said: No, you can’t buy  those towels. You have to buy towels  that have the embroidered name of  KBR on  the  towel,  triple  the cost.  Henry  said  it would  cost a  lot of  money.  It doesn’t matter,  the  taxpayers are paying for this, cost plus.  Triple the price of the towels so you  can put the embroidered initials of the  company on the towels.  How about $45 for a case of Coca-  Cola? How about $7,500 a month to  lease an SUV? Henry Bunting told us  about that as well.  I described the other  issues. Rory  Mayberry—Rory showed up at a hearing. He was a food service supervisor  for KBR in Iraq at a cafeteria. He said  he was told by his supervisor: Don’t  you dare talk to Government auditors  when they show up. If you do, you will  get fired or you will get sent to an active combat zone. Don’t you dare talk  to a Government auditor.  He said: We routinely provided food  to the soldiers that had expired date  stamps on it.  The supervisor said: It doesn’t matter—the expired date stamps—feed the  expired food to the troops.  We know  from previous press accounts that at one point that company  was charging for 42,000 meals a day to  soldiers when they were actually only  feeding 14,000 soldiers. Rory said the  same thing. Rory Mayberry, a supervisor in one of the KBR food service  situations in Iraq said they were charging for meals for soldiers who weren’t  there, and the supervisor said: We are  doing that because we had lost money  previously, so now we are charging for  meals that aren’t being served to soldiers.  How  about  an  eyewitness  to  an  $85,000 brand new truck left beside the  road in a noncombat zone in Iraq to be  torched because they didn’t have the  proper wrench to fix the tire? It doesn’t  matter,  the American  taxpayer  is  going to buy the new truck, cost plus.

960,166,2007-04-19,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce the ‘‘Specialty Crop  Competition Act of 2007.’’ This bipartisan legislation co-sponsored by the  distinguished Senator from Michigan,  Senator STABENOW, increases the focus  on  the  contribution  that  specialty  crops add to the United States agricultural economy. This bill specifically  provides the proper and necessary attention  to many  challenges  faced  throughout each segment of the industry.  Most do not realize the significance  of specialty crops and their value to  the U.S. economy and the health of  U.S. citizens. According to the United  States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service,  fruits  and  vegetables alone added $29.9 billion to  the U.S. economy in 2002. This figure  does not even include the contribution  of nursery and other ornamental plant  production, which our bill recognizes.  The specialty crop industry also accounts for more than $53 billion in cash  receipts for U.S. producers, which is  close to 54 percent of the total cash receipts for all crops. A surprising fact to  some is that my State of Idaho is a top  producer  of  specialty  crops.  Idaho  proudly boasts production of cherries,  table grapes, apples, onions, carrots,  several varieties of seed crops and of  course one of our most notable specialty crops, potatoes.  Maintaining a viable and sustainable  specialty crop  industry also benefits  the health of America’s citizens. Obesity continues to plague millions of  people today and is a very serious and  deepening threat not only to personal  health and well-being, but to the resources of the economy as well. This  issue is now receiving the necessary attention at the highest levels, and specialty crops will continue to play a  prominent role in reversing the obesity  trend.  The  ‘‘Specialty  Crop  Competition  Act’’ will also provide a stronger position for the U.S. industry in the global  market arena. This  legislation promotes initiatives that will combat diseases, both native and  foreign, that  continue to be used as non-tariff barriers to U.S. exports by foreign governments. Additionally, provisions in this  bill seek improvements to federal regulations  and  resources  that  impede  timely consideration of industry sanitary and phytosanitary petitions.  This bill does not provide direct subsidies  to producers  like other programs. This legislation takes a major  step forward to highlight the significance of  this  industry  to  the agriculture economy, the benefits to the  health of U.S. citizens, and the need for  a stable, affordable, diverse, and secure  supply of food.  Senator STABENOW,  I, and our co-  sponsors  fully  intend  to work with  Chairman HARKIN, Ranking Member  CHAMBLISSand the entire Senate Agriculture Committee to include this legislation in the new Farm Bill that Congress will soon be debating. Specialty  crops have never sat at the head of the  farm policy table, but their importance  to our Nation’s health, security, and  economy cannot be avoided any longer.  I look forward to working with my  colleagues and the Administration to  consider this comprehensive and necessary legislation as we begin to discuss new initiatives for the 2007 Farm  Bill.  By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself,  Mr. CRAIG, Mr. CONRAD, Mr.  SCHUMER, and Ms. CANTWELL):  S. 1161. A bill to amend title XVIII of  the Social Security Act to authorize  the expansion of medicare coverage of  medical nutrition therapy services; to  the Committee on Finance.  ",2007
961,166,2007-04-19,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased today to  join with my colleagues Senators CRAIG and CONRAD  and others in introducing the Medicare  Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 2007.  This marks  the  fourth  consecutive  Congress  that Senator CRAIG and  I  have joined together in introducing a  bill to expand the current Medicare  Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) benefit.  In 2000, the Congress passed a bill authorizing Medicare payment for MNT  services, but only for patients with diabetes and renal diseases. Recognizing  that many other diseases also have a  nutrition component  to  their  treatment, Congress asked the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid services to report  back  to  Congress  their  recommendations on MNT coverage. That  report was submitted to Congress in  2004 and recommended that patients  with conditions such as hypertension,  dyslipidemia, and certain cancers be eligible to receive MNT therapy.  Medical Nutrition Therapy is not nutrition counseling, it is much more. It  involves a specific diagnosis of a disease, condition, or disorder that can be  treated with nutrition  intervention.  That is why Congress limited MNT provider status to Registered Dietitians;  they have the specific training necessary to address nutritional interventions as part of a diseased related therapy.  As we all know, Medicare is under  tremendous financial stress. It is therefore critically important that bills designed to expand Medicare’s coverage  be both necessary and cost effective.  This is exactly why Senator CRAIGand  I have been such consistent supporters  of expanding the MNT benefit.  Under our current bill, there is no  mandated expansion of the benefit. Instead, we simply give the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services the authority to expand coverage using the  National Coverage Determination process. The Congress has mandated that  the criteria used in that process is necessary and reasonable.  As a result, the MNT benefit will not  be expanded beyond diabetes and renal  diseases unless such expansion is proven to be cost effective. This is likely  not a difficult test for MNT to meet.

I feel much more  comfortable with this legislation today  than I did with any I helped introduce  last year or the year before because I  have learned a lot more. But I will  guarantee my colleagues that there are  several areas in which I would welcome  advice. Over the last several weeks, I  have met with a dozen, two dozen environmental groups, utilities, Tennessee  citizens, others who had suggestions.  For example, the discussion points that  I have put into the record contain five  points that are arguable. I have come  to a  tentative conclusion on  them.  That is in the bill. But there is another  side to the point. I am looking for advice.  For example, should we cap only carbon or all greenhouse gases emitted  from electricity plants? I chose to cap  CO2only. That is because this is a four-  pollutant bill—sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, and carbon. It is not primarily a  climate change bill.  Another  consideration  is  that  it  seems Europe’s experience is that it  may be better to cap just carbon and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:23 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G19AP6.055 S19APPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007
964,180,2007-04-19,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I am  very pleased to again  join with the  Senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN, as an original cosponsor of legislation, America’s Red Rocks Wilderness  Act of 2007, to designate areas of pristine Federal lands in Utah as wilderness.  I had an opportunity to travel twice  to Utah. I viewed firsthand some of the  lands that would be designated for wilderness under Senator DURBIN’s bill. I  was able to view most of the proposed  wilderness areas from the air, and was  able  to  enhance my  understanding  through hikes outside of the Zion National Park on the Dry Creek Bench  wilderness unit contained in this proposal and inside the Grand Staircase-  Escalante  National  Monument  to  Upper Calf Creek Falls. I also viewed  the lands proposed for designation in  this bill from a river trip down the Colorado River, and  in the San Rafael  Swell with members of  the Emery  County government.  I support this legislation, for a few  reasons, but most of all because I have  personally seen what is at stake, and I  know  the marvelous  resources  that  Wisconsinites and all Americans own  in the Bureau of Land Management,  BLM, lands of southern Utah.  Second, I support this legislation because I believe it sets the broadest and  boldest mark for the lands that should  be protected in southern Utah. I believe that when the Senate considers  wilderness  legislation  it  ought  to  know, as a benchmark, the full measure of those lands which are deserving  of wilderness protection. This bill encompasses all the BLM lands of wilderness quality  in Utah. Unfortunately,  the Senate has not, as we do today, always had the benefit of considering  wilderness designations for all of the  deserving lands in southern Utah.

It is  my privilege to applaud Ms. Mark as a deserving community member and  friend  for her  many years of entrepreneurship, community  service, and civil activism on a day when she  is being acknowledged for her vast achievements.  As President and Chairman of the Board of  The WW Group,  Inc., Ms. Mark displays a  keen business sense and devotion  to promoting the physical and mental well-being of  her fellow citizens, a commitment that she has  worked diligenty  to nurture and expand  for  over 30 years.

The American Heart Association, Detroit Institute for Children, Detroit Renaissance  and Seeds of Peace are  just a  few of  the  many organizations that have benefited from  her involvement.  Beyond her role as a business leader and  pillar of the community, Ms. Mark is also the  proud mother of 5 children and 19 grandchildren who share a bond of giving and receiving  to each other,  their neighbors and  community.  I am honored to express my gratitude and  admiration to Ms. Mark for the profound impact she has on the lives of men and women  around  the country and her  impact on  the  Metro-Detroit Community. She  truly exemplifies ‘‘Boneh Kehilla’’.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in recognizing Ms. Mark on this momentous occasion.

EDOLPHUS TOWNS  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 19, 2007  ",2007
966,201,2007-04-19,Mr. TOWNS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to commemorate Yom HaShoah, Holocaust  Remembrance Day. I join the Jewish communities of my district  in Brooklyn,  the entire  American Jewish community, and the State of  Israel in recognizing this barbaric chapter of  world history.  Over 60 years ago, the Nazi regime in Germany began  the wholesale slaughter of  the  European Jewry. This occurred with little public outrage in the United States and the international community. The world, as well  the  American government under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, refused to act to save  European Jewry and that silence undoubtedly  contributed to the death of six million Jews, a  million of whom were children.  When we hear the number six million, we  shudder. The enormity of that number is paralyzing. Merely  trying  to count  to six million  would take months. Imagining the Nazi death  machine executing so many human beings is  daunting. Particularly for those of us who have  not survived the Holocaust, absorbing the reality of that destruction from survivors is so essential to passing on the history of the Holocaust.  The moving museums and heart wrenching  memorials dedicated to the Holocaust across  the United States are vital in educating today’s  youth about the horrors of the Holocaust, and  I want  to  commend all organizations and  groups  that are committed  to  this  important  work.  It  is additionally critical  that European  countries preserve the glaring remnants of the  Holocaust that still exist today. Whether they  are death camps, mass gravesites, cemeteries, synagogues or other holy sites  from  pre-Holocaust Europe, European governments  have an obligation to preserve those sites for  future generations. Sadly, numerous European  countries including Lithuania, Ukraine and Romania have on occasion shirked their responsibilities in this regard.  While we remember the absolute devastation  the Holocaust wrought on  the Jewish  community, we also mark  the  strength of  those who heroically resisted the Nazis including those who fought in the Warsaw Ghetto  Uprising and at  the Sobibor extermination  camp.  I am privileged  to  represent a  large but  dwindling population of Holocaust survivors in  my district. Many of  these survivors  rebuilt  their lives with nothing more than the shirt on  their back. Today, based on the strong foundations  of  those Holocaust  survivors,  the  beautiful Jewish communities of Williamsburg,  Midwood and Canarsie have flourished. These  communities represent the best of Jewish life  and have been instrumental in resurrecting religious life in the aftermath of the Holocaust by  creating synagogues, yeshivas, and other religious institutions.  Madam Speaker,  I would  like  to  take  this  opportunity to recognize the efforts of organizations that have taken extraordinary steps in  servicing and caring for the Holocaust survivor  population  in my district: The Metropolitan  Council on Jewish Poverty; The United Jewish  Organizations of Williamsburg; The Council of  Jewish Organizations of Flatbush; The Jewish  Community Council of Canarsie; The Conference of Jewish Material Claims Against  Germany; Peasch Tikvah and all  the Bikkur  Cholim organizations. Their selfless work for  Holocaust survivors continues to serve as an  inspiration to me and I am honored to recognize their hard work.  Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues here  today in remembering the Holocaust. Though  there are still Holocaust deniers today, it is imperative that we never forget.  f  TRIBUTE TO THE TUCKER HIGH  SCHOOL BOYS BASKETBALL TEAM  HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR.

969,208,2007-04-19,Mrs. DRAKE.," Mr. Speaker, this has been a  very somber week for the Commonwealth of  Virginia as we have watched  tragedy unfold  on one of our proud universities.  As Virginia’s largest University, the Virginia  Tech family extends into every corner of our  Commonwealth and we have all been affected  by Monday’s events.  Unfortunately, we are not able  to explain  such unthinkable tragedies. Furthermore, mere  words seem small under the weight of such a  heartbreaking event. However,  I express my  deepest sympathy  for  the victims and  their  families and I offer a prayer of support and  condolence for the Virginia Tech community.  As Virginia, and  indeed  the entire Nation,  grieves so many young lives being lost, it is  important  to  remember  the grace,  love and  goodness exhibited by those who survived this  horrible tragedy.  I was  inspired by  the ability of students,  alumni, faculty, family and neighbors to come  together driven by a sense of community and  compassion to support others in their time of  need.  As I took part in yesterday’s convocation at  Cassell Coliseum,  I was encouraged by  the  leadership demonstrated by Gov. Tim Kaine,  President George W. Bush and the numerous  dedicated educators at Virginia Tech.  The coming days, weeks, and months will  continue  to be difficult ones as  the Virginia  Tech community comes  to  terms with what  took place on a dark day in April. But it will  also be a time of healing and I am confident  that Hokie nation will be able to come back  stronger because of the compassion and character that has been displayed since this tragedy.  Just as the heinous actions of one troubled  individual so obviously filled with hate has left  us grasping for answers, the reaction of the  Virginia Tech family gave reason to make all  Virginians proud and demonstrate the tremendous promise of our future generation.  f  COMMEMORATING HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY AND REFLECTING  UPON  THE  GENOCIDE  IN  DARFUR  HON.

970,208,2007-04-19,Ms. WASSERMAN  SCHULTZ.,"  Madam  Speaker, last Sunday marked Holocaust Remembrance Day, which honors the memory of  the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust  during World War II. We are now in the midst  of the Days of Remembrance established by  the United States Congress as our Nation’s  commemoration of these victims. We remember the Holocaust so that the lessons and responsibilities left from this tragedy are not lost.  Always, but especially now, it is imperative  that we remember and take action against the  genocide  that  is  currently  taking place  in  Darfur. As we look to the past to remember  those that perished at the hand of Nazi Germany, we must  not  forget  the  2,500,000  Darfurian civilians targeted and displaced because of their ethnic or racial identity or the  more  than 300,000 people killed  thus  far.  Tragically, over 1,600 villages have been destroyed by Sudanese government soldiers and  government-backed militias. The growing number of destroyed homes and lives is a testament to the fact that simply remembering is  not enough.  Madam Speaker, as you know, children are  among the most helpless victims of any genocide. One million of the six million Jews that  were killed  in  the Holocaust were children.  Jewish children were targeted by the Nazi regime, and now the children of Darfur suffer the  brutal effects that burning villages, shootings,  rapes, and the search for refuge have on the  youngest victims of this tragedy.  My heart is warmed by the work of grassroots  organizations  in South  Florida  and  across the country that bring attention to the  crisis in Darfur. We must heed the lessons of  Holocaust Remembrance Day and make sure  that another Holocaust never happens again.  Racially  inspired hatred has surfaced many  times in the decades since the Holocaust, and  it is our duty to stop the disaster in Darfur and  make it the last genocide of the 21st century.  f  INTRODUCTION OF THE TAX EXEMPT QUALIFICATION FOR FEDERALLY  GUARANTEED WATER,  WASTEWATER, AND OTHER ESSENTIAL COMMUNITY FACILITY  LOANS  HON. RON LEWIS  OFKENTUCKY  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 19, 2007  ",2007
971,208,2007-04-19,Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky.," Madam Speaker, I  rise  to  inform my colleagues of  legislation  I  have introduced today to assist some of our  Nation’s most underserved  communities  in  funding essential infrastructure.  The legislation that I have proposed will permit  interest on  federally guaranteed water,  wastewater, and other essential community facility loans to also qualify to be tax exempt. I  introduced similar legislation in the 109th Congresses.  Rural communities throughout America continue  to  face challenges  in accessing basic  needs. We can improve this situation by supporting  the development of necessary  infrastructure  such  as  dependable water  and  wastewater systems, and essential community  facilities like schools, hospitals, and police and  fire stations.  Unfortunately, many of these same communities struggle to acquire sufficient funding to  support local development projects. Increased  access  to  federally guaranteed  tax exempt  loans would provide significant assistance in  these efforts.  I believe the incentives offered in this bill will  allow small and rural communities better opportunities  to  receive  increased credit  to  finance community facility projects.

972,208,2007-04-19,Mr. BONNER.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor the life of a young man from the First  Congressional District of Alabama who  recently made the ultimate sacrifice in defense  of his country while helping to spread freedom  abroad.  Army Staff Sgt. Harrison Brown, formerly of  Prichard, was assigned to the 2nd Battalion,  69th Armor Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat  Team, 3rd  Infantry Division, based at Fort  Benning, Georgia. He was killed  in combat  earlier  this month while bravely serving and  protecting this great nation in Operation Iraqi  Freedom.  ‘‘Duck,’’ as he was known  to his  friends,  joined the Army 13 years ago to provide for  his wife and children. During his career in the  Army, including multiple tours of duty in Iraq,  Sgt. Brown set a standard of excellence and  displayed the qualities of discipline, devotion,  and dedication  to country  that are  the hallmarks of men and women throughout the long  and distinguished history of the American military.  A 1994 graduate of Blount High School,  ‘‘Duck’’ played baseball and basketball and  was a standout wide receiver on the varsity  football  team. Blount won  the state 5A high  school  football  championship while  ‘‘Duck’’  was on the team. He went on to play one year  of college football at Tuskegee University on  scholarship before he joined the Army.  Madam Speaker, at this difficult time, it is  only appropriate  for us  to pause and give  thanks to God that there are still young men  like Harrison Brown. His life and actions personify  the very best America has  to offer.  I  feel certain his many  friends and  family, as  well as his comrades  in  the United States  Army, while mourning  the  loss of  this  fine  young man, are also taking this opportunity to  remember his many accomplishments and to  recall the fine gift they each received simply  from knowing him and having him as an integral part of their lives.  Madam Speaker,  I urge my colleagues  to  take a moment and pay tribute to Sgt. Harrison Brown and his selfless devotion to not  only our country and the freedom we enjoy,  but to a people who are in the demanding but  important stages of a new  life—a new  freedom—in their own land.  We should also remember his wife, Delisha  Brown; their three children; his mother, Chris  Ann Brown; his sister, Mary Dozier; and his  other relatives and many friends. Our prayer is  that God will give them all the strength and  courage that only He can provide to sustain  them during the difficult days ahead.  It was Joseph Campbell who said, ‘‘A hero  is someone who has given his or her life to  something bigger than oneself.’’  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:09 Apr 20, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A19AP8.028 E19APPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 2 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n a r o c r o c j         ",2007
973,215,2007-04-19,Mr. MARKEY.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to introduce the Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act.  The nexus between global warming and the  national security of the United States is a crucial, yet long-ignored, issue. The adverse consequences  of  rising  global  temperatures  present not only a potential environmental catastrophe but a national security emergency.  The security-related consequences of global  warming will range from hampering U.S. military operations  to worsening  the scarcity of  essential  resources  in already unstable  regions—which can lead to the failed states that  are a central breeding ground  for  terrorism,  But because the U.S. intelligence community  has never analyzed  the potential  for global  warming to harm our national security, we lack  a  thorough  understanding  of what  these  threats are. This means that the Department  of Defense and other security agencies cannot  comprehensively plan  for  the security consequences of global warming  the way  that  they plan for countless other serious contingencies.  Today, I am introducing the ‘‘Global Climate  Change Security Oversight Act.’’ This bill  is  cosponsored by the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. BARTLETT)  the  gentleman  from Connecticut, Mr. LARSON, the gentlelady from California, Ms. ESHOO, the gentlelady from California, Ms. SOLIS,  the gentlelady  from New  York, Mr. HALL,  the gentleman  from Washington, Mr. MCDERMOTT, and  the gentleman  from Massachusetts, ",2007
974,215,2007-04-19,Mr. OLVER.," This legislation will jump-start U.S. defense planning for  the security consequences of global warming  by authorizing a National Intelligence Estimate  (NIB)  to assess  the  implications of global  warming to United States security and military  operations. Our bill, the House companion to  legislation already introduced by Senator DURBINand Senator HAGEL, will provide a crucial  planning and risk-assessment tool as the Congress  seeks  innovative  solutions  to global  warming. Developed to assess the most serious threats to the United States, NIBs are the  most authoritative  intelligence  judgments on  national security  issues. This  legislation will  also  fund  research by  the Defense Department into the consequences for U.S. military  operations posed by global warming.  It seems clear that our geopolitical and national security posture will only grow worse if  we do not act forcefully to curb our dangerous  dependence on imported oil and reduce our  emissions of global warming pollution. At the  beginning of February,  the world’s  top scientists, as part of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),  provided a scientific smoking gun that human  activities were unequivocally  responsible  for  global warming. Two weeks ago, their second  report told us what happens when the climatic  bullet hits. The developing world will bear the  brunt of the collateral damage from our historic global warming emissions, but the United  States will experience  its own self-inflicted  wounds, including threats to our national security and military readiness.  The United States must act now to understand the security implications of global warming. The Global Climate Change Security  Oversight Act will allow us to do so.  f  CONGRATULATIONS  TO  MR.

975,215,2007-04-19,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Madam Speaker, It is  with great pleasure that I rise to congratulate  Mr. Willie Beasley on the occasion of his 94th  birthday which will  take place on April 28,  2007. Madam Speaker, to live a long life is indeed desirable and many of us would find it  most  desirable. However,  to  live  a  long,  healthy wholesome and productive life is awesome. Such has been the blessed fate of Mr.  Willie Beasley who has been a great husband,  wonderful father, tremendous churchman and  a civic  leader who has understood what  it  should mean to live in a free and democratic  society. For many years, Mr. Beasley was an  outstanding leader at the Carey Certentenary  AME Church, he and his family were anchored  in the community and to this day his children  Ward and Carol continue in his and the family’s tradition.

976,4,2007-05-02,Mr. WALZ of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago today, President Bush  landed for a photo opportunity on an  aircraft carrier in front of a banner  that said ‘‘Mission Accomplished’’ and  declared an end to major combat in  Iraq. Four years later this President  refuses to even discuss the reality of a  military mission that has entered its  fifth year.  Yesterday the President vetoed only  the second bill that has ever come to  his desk. He called it a ‘‘prescription  for chaos and confusion.’’ I ask, how is  that different from what we have now?  He refuses to even hold the Iraqis accountable  for making political, economic or diplomatic reforms that he  promised and they promised to make.  He’s holding up funding for our troops  and for our veterans.  But what exactly  is the President  waiting for? Now that the President  has rejected our legislation, he has the  responsibility  to  tell  the American  people how many more years does he  expect us to stay. Do you think it will  be 5? Maybe 10? And what exactly do  the ground  conditions  look  like  in  order to have us beginning to withdraw? Wishful thinking, political talking points and rigid ideology do not  make good foreign policy.  This President was wrong when he  declared an end of combat operations,  and he has been consistently wrong  about every single thing in Iraq. It’s  time that this President works with  the new Congress, elected by the majority of the American people, so that  we can bring about a change to this  war and truly secure America.  f  STOP THE POLITICAL GAMES  (Ms. FALLIN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)  ",2007
977,4,2007-05-02,Ms. FALLIN.," Mr. Speaker, this is a  difficult time for our Nation. We are  all war weary. We are all heartbroken  over any loss of life, and we are all concerned about the cost of the war.  All Americans, Republicans, Democrats, and, yes, the President, want  this war over as soon as possible. It’s  time to stop the political games and  put  the needs of our men and our  women defending our Nation first.  The people of America want a solution to bring the troops home, but not  at the expense of jeopardizing the safety and the future of our Nation. As a  Nation, we must make a strong commitment and a declaration to the world  that  the United States will defend  itself and will not tolerate terrorism,  nor will we coddle terrorists or surrender or appease them.  The Commander  in Chief vetoed a  bill which sought to micromanage the  war on terror, tie the hands of our generals, and provide a surrender date to  the enemies. Congress must uphold the  President’s veto, set aside the cut-and-  run attitude, the  loser attitude,  for  good.  Where is the pride for the defense our  Nation, the liberty and the freedoms  that thousands of men and women have  given their lives for in earlier years?  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  MCNULTY). The Chair would  remind  guests in the gallery that any expression of favor or disfavor for what is  said on the floor is a violation of the  rules.  f  THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE  IN  IRAQ AND PRESIDENT BUSH  IS  NOT WILLING TO TAKE THE WAR  IN A NEW DIRECTION  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2007
978,4,2007-05-02,Mr. PAYNE.," Mr. Speaker, over this  past weekend, five more American soldiers were killed in Iraq, bringing the  number killed in April to over 100 U.S.  soldiers. It was the deadliest month for  American soldiers this year. Sadly, the  total number of Americans killed now  stands at 3,351, along with thousands of  innocent Iraqi men, women and children.  The realities on the ground that our  brave soldiers continue to face day in  and day out stand in stark contrast to  President  Bush’s  pronouncement  4  years ago  that major combat operations in Iraq were over.  If major operations were over 4 years  ago, what have our troops been fighting the last 4 years? If indeed our mission was accomplished 4 years ago, as  the banner behind the President on  that aircraft carrier proclaimed, what  are American troops still doing in Iraq?  If the President truly wants to bring  our mission to a just conclusion, he  should work with Congress instead of  simply vetoing our funding bill as he  did. It’s now up to the President to decide if he will support accountability  for Iraqis, benchmarks for success, and  new direction in Iraq, for we cannot  stay this course.  f  b1030  H.R. 2027, THE MILITARY PAY  IMPROVEMENT ACT  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",2007
979,4,2007-05-02,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker, under  current law, military pay rates must  be reasonably comparable to those in  the private sector with similar skills,  education, and experience.  Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints over the years, the military  pay increase has not always met this  criteria and a ‘‘pay gap’’ was created.  This gap is not only unfair to our brave  men and women in uniform. It also has  raised  retention  and  readiness  concerns.  For this reason, I have introduced  H.R. 2027, the Military Pay Improvement Act, which would give them a  minimum 3.5 percent pay raise.  Our Nation’s brave men and women  in uniform have fought gallantly to ensure  the continued  safety,  security,  and prosperity of this great Nation. I  believe it is unacceptable that we task  these men and women with extraordinary responsibilities especially, during wartime, and cannot compensate  them accordingly. The debt we owe  them for their sacrifices can never be  repaid. However, my bill will take a  small step  in the right direction to  show our appreciation for their valor.  I urge all my colleagues to cosponsor  the bill.  f  COMMUNICATION FROM HON. JOHN  A.

982,11,2007-05-02,Ms. CASTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 348  provides for consideration of H.R. 1429,  the Improving Head Start Act of 2007,  under a structured rule.  The rule provides 1 hour of debate  equally divided and controlled by the  chairman and  the  ranking minority  member of  the Committee on Education and Labor. The rules waive all  points of order against the bill except  those arising under clauses 9 or 10 of  rule XXI. The rule makes in order and  provides  appropriate waivers  for  12  amendments, all contained in the committee report.  Mr. Speaker, for more than 40 years  Head Start has served as the premier  educational  and  developmental  program for more than 20 million American children and families. Head Start  works. It works because it is a well-researched,  comprehensive  initiative  that combines children’s educational  needs with health care and parent outreach.  This  comprehensive  approach  to  child health, nutrition and learning is  one of our best tools to tackle the  achievement gap in education for children living in poverty across our Nation.  The achievement gap begins far before children enter elementary school.  Head Start tackles the achievement  gap through cognitive, social and emotional  child  development,  each  of  which is a key contributor to entering  elementary school prepared to succeed.  Today 20 percent of America’s 12 million children under age 6 live in poverty. We know that a family’s income  level greatly affects their children’s access to educational opportunities. The  reality of poverty for so many children,  unfortunately, is tied to low success  rates in our classrooms. This is true in  my home State of Florida. In my community in the Tampa Bay area, over  5,300 children currently are served by  Head Start, but many thousands more  are on waiting lists and are eligible.  They are on waiting lists because for  so many years  previous Congresses  have failed to reenact Head Start, and  the White House has proposed flat-line  budgets, so our kids merely have been  treading water. With no improvements  or increases in funding since 2003, and  inflation going up, it has become more  difficult to maintain the well-known,  high-quality elements in Head Start.  The good news is that this new Congress will change that today and make  the smartest investment for our country’s future workforce. We are going to  put more kids on the path to success  when we pass this bill and rule today.  This bill will  improve teacher and  classroom  quality,  strengthen  the  focus on school readiness, expand access to thousands more children across  America,  strengthen  comprehensive  services, increase the number of children in early Head Start, because we  are a lot smarter these days based upon  the research that has been done on  early child development and the development of the brain. We are going to  allow homeless children to enroll, and  we are going to do a better job, my colleague from Florida, for children who  are just learning English.  On Monday, I paid a visit to the West  Tampa Head Start Center and delivered  books to the kids and teachers to mark  the four decades of smashing success of  this  holistic, wraparound  initiative  that empowers all of us. These children  are eager and ready to learn if we give  them the tools.  We need to raise strong and healthy  children. Head Start prepares children  to succeed in school and in life. The administration’s  slow-motion  cuts  of  Head Start over past years will now be  reversed. The American people stood  up in November and asked for change,  and today we are going to stand up for  them.  b1130  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr.  LINCOLN  DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would like to  thank my  friend,  the  gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. CASTOR) for the time,  and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  It is very important for the future of  our children  that  they develop  the  skills and receive the education necessary to make them a success later in  life.  Unfortunately, many  children  begin their education without the proper foundation, putting them at a disadvantage that has long-term effects  on their education.  We must do all we can so that low-income children do not begin their education at a disadvantage. That is why  the Head Start program was created.  In order to give children the proper  foundation they need to begin their  education, the Head Start program provides comprehensive early childhood  education development services. These  services  include  child  development,  educational, health, nutritional, social  and other activities. These  services  prepare children to enter kindergarten  and  for  their continued educational  success.  In fiscal year 2005, the Head Start  program provided developmental services to over 900,000 children, 35,000 of  them in my State of Florida. Most of  the children that receive the critical  developmental  skills offered by  the  Head Start program come from low-income families, and at Head Start they  receive the early educational foundation to do well in their later education  and hopefully break the chain of poverty.  The  underlying  legislation  being  brought to the floor today builds on  the success of the program and  improves  its weaknesses.  It authorizes  over  $7 billion  for  fiscal year  2008,  strengthens  Head  Start’s  academic  standards by emphasizing cognitive development and topics critical to school  readiness.  It is important that the children in  Head Start receive the best education  possible. There are, Mr. Speaker, several provisions in the underlying legislation that I believe will help with this  goal. First, the bill seeks to ensure  that a greater number of Head Start  teachers are better trained and educated in early childhood development,  particularly in fundamental skills such  as language, pre-reading and pre-mathematics, within 2 years.  Competition encourages better quality. As recommended by a 2005 GAO  study, the bill seeks to increase competition among Head Start grantees to  help weed out poor performers and  offer stronger programs.  The bill also  seeks greater  transparency and disclosure regarding how  Head Start funds are spent. This will  help to fight financial abuse and further ensure that Federal Head Start  funds reach the disadvantaged children  that they are meant to serve.  Yesterday, in the Rules Committee,  Mr. Speaker, Resident Commissioner  FORTUN˜Ooffered an amendment to this  legislation to allow religious organizations to not ignore religion in their  hiring practices. The provision was included  in previous Head Start reauthorization bills. However, the majority on the Rules Committee blocked  that amendment  from  consideration  today by the full House.  Head Start has a proud history of inclusion of  faith-based organizations.  Approximately 80 grantees have religious affiliations. Without the Fortun˜o  amendment,  faith-based Head Start  grantees may decide to stop offering  Head Start programs. That would hurt  the children in those programs.  In 2004, the Department of Health and  Human Services issued regulations requiring any organization that receives  direct financial assistance from the Department, such as Head Start, to not  engage in inherently religious activities such as worship, religious instruction or proselytizing as part of the program or services funded by HHS. So objections to the Fortun˜o amendment, in  my opinion, are unfounded.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
983,11,2007-05-02,Ms. CASTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I anticipate on the floor of the House today we  will hear some debate over the role of  faith-based  organizations  in  Head  Start. Republicans would like language  that would repeal existing civil rights  protections in this Head Start law that  ensure the program’s Federal funds discriminate, and we are opposed to that.

989,25,2007-05-02,Mr. DOGGETT.,"  I  thank  the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, I believe our Republican colleagues are correct. This Congress spoke with one voice on the war  on terrorism, and we continue to do so.  Indeed, if President Bush had pursued  the war on terrorism and the perpetrators of 9/11, instead of getting diverted  to Iraq, which had nothing to do with  9/11, then when he hoisted that ‘‘Mission Accomplished’’ banner four years  ago, it would have had meaning.  Instead, we have a burn rate of $10  billion every month in Iraq, $14 million  every hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a  week, every week, every month of the  year. More importantly, the real burn  rate is in the loss of more than 3,300  American lives, brave men and women  over there fighting for our country; 96  percent of those deaths, almost all of  them,  lost their  life after President  Bush  declared  ‘‘Mission  Accomplished.’’  Today, the President can veto our attempt to secure a safe, orderly, phased  redeployment of our troops from Iraq,  but he can’t veto reality. Our troops  are coming home. It’s just a question  of what price  is paid  in blood and  money before that happens.  The President talks about listening  to the commanders and the generals. I  wonder if he was listening to General  William Odom, the former National Security Agency Director, last Saturday  when he said the President has let the  Iraq war proceed on ‘‘automatic pilot,  making no corrections in the face of  accumulating evidence that his strategy cannot be rescued.’’  If the President had listened to the  generals, we would never have gone  into Iraq in the first place. It was General Schwarzkopf who said, we would  become ‘‘like [a] dinosaur in a tar pit.’’  If he had listened to the generals like  General Shinseki, if he had insisted on  going into Iraq, he would have sent  enough troops to get the job done and  not  turned  over  all  those weapons  dumps to be converted into IEDs.  If he had listened to the generals, he  would have provided our veterans with  the health care that they have earned  and  deserved  instead  of  subjecting  them back here to the facilities and  care they found in the United States.  The generals who disagree with this  President earn a new title: Retired.  ",2007
990,25,2007-05-02,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the  former chairman of the Armed Services  Committee, DUNCANHUNTER of California, now the ranking member.  ",2007
991,25,2007-05-02,Mr. HUNTER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I think it’s important  to interpret this debate. I have heard  the Speaker talk about redeployment  and say that there is a lot of discretion  that  is  left  to  the  administration.  There is no discretion. The dates of so-  called redeployment are defined. You  either start going out July 1 or October  1. Redeployment means withdrawals.  If generals do not start redeploying,  do not start withdrawing from the battleground, you  can  bet Democratic  leadership will be here pulling them  into hearings, asking them why they  didn’t saddle up their brigades, their  battalions and their divisions and start  to move them off the battlefield. So  let’s get this straight. This is about  withdrawing from the battlefield.  Listening to this debate, and listening to the controversy and the statements by Democratic leadership that  have preceded this vote today, there is  a constant theme: Somehow American  soldiers and marines are victims. They  are victims of extended tours; they are  victims, the last gentleman said, they  claim, of not getting enough health  care. They are people that have been  victims in the war against terror.  Let me tell you,  I have seen the  timelines that are given, the 270 days  for Marines, the 365 days. A number of  them have gone  through one,  two,  three and sometimes four tours. Our  Americans, and that includes my son,  who  is deploying now  for the third  time, will not fail, they will not crack,  they will not stretch. They will hold,  and they will carry out this mission  against terrorists.  We are right now in the second phase  of a program we have used for 60 years  to stand up free governments around  the world. You stand up a free government. We have done that.  Secondly, you stand up a military capable of protecting that free government. That is a second stage. That is a  stage we are in right now.  Thirdly, we leave, because America  doesn’t covet anything that another  nation has.  We are in the second stage right now.  It’s tough, and it’s difficult. This is a  tough, difficult mission, but it is a mission that we can accomplish.  I  am  reminded,  lastly,  that  the  Speaker talked about stopping the war.  That is how she described this bill. The  Democratic leadership does not have  the power to stop the war against terror. All they have the power to do is to  leave the battlefield. That would be a  disaster for the United States of America.  ",2007
992,25,2007-05-02,Mr. OBEY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 20 seconds.  I would also observe that our soldiers  don’t have the power to require Iraqi  politicians to quit killing each other  and make the diplomatic and political  compromises necessary  to  end  this  civil war. Only Iraqi politicians have  that, and we are trying to send them a  message with this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. ANDREWS).  (Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2007
993,25,2007-05-02,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker,  by  vetoing this bill, the President refuses  to sustain the troops that we have sent  to Iraq. Every dollar they need, every  ounce of protection they need, and the  health care they need when they come  home is in this bill that he has vetoed.  We refuse to sustain a failed, endless  policy that takes us nowhere.  The President refuses to acknowledge  the reality that we have sent our sons  and  daughters  to  be  referees  in  a  bloody civil war. We acknowledge that  reality, and we want to stop it.  The President refuses to acknowledge  the  comments of General Petraeus,  who says that ending this civil war is a  political mission, not a military one.  We acknowledge that reality, and we  provide the tools to achieve success in  that political mission.  Today the President has refused to  acknowledge the will of the American  people, but we are expressing the will  of the American people.  We will vote to override this veto,  and the result will obtain. But we will  never yield, never quit, never back up  in this effort to change this failing policy and bring our troops home from  Iraq.  Vote to override this veto.  ",2007

997,25,2007-05-02,Mr. KINGSTON.,"  I thank the gentleman from California.  Mr. Speaker, I think that we have to  sustain this veto today. I think it’s the  right thing to do, because I think we  need to go back to the drawing board  on this. Number one, the President  does have the constitutionally defined  duty to fight wars, to direct the militia, particularly in a time of war, and  I think that we are getting into a position where we have a lot of folks on  Capitol Hill, perhaps as high as 535 of  us, who think we can run the war more  than the Commander in Chief.  I think we have to recognize that  constitutionally the President has to  do that. I think the President really  has to veto this bill. It’s as much for  the preservation of the office as it is  for his own personal views today.  I think, secondly, while the benchmarks  themselves make  sense,  and  there is a lot of bipartisan agreement  on the benchmarks, there is also great  division as to can these benchmarks be  achieved by the dates outlined in the  bill.

998,32,2007-05-02,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,  I yield 4 minutes now to the gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr.  subcommittee chair and responsible  for  bringing this bill to the floor.  ,2007
999,32,2007-05-02,Mr. KILDEE.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  Mr. Chairman,  in March, the Education  and Labor Committee  overwhelming passed by a vote of 42–1 H.R.  1429, which was my privilege to introduce with both Democrats and Republicans as cosponsors. I hope at the close  of today’s debate the full House will do  similarly.  Head Start has served our most vulnerable children and families well for  42 years; and more recently, early Head  Start has done the same for infants and  toddlers.  Head Start works, and this bill will  make it work even better. This bill increases Head Start’s authorization by  $461 million  to benefit as many as  10,000 more  children,  and  increases  funding  for  Indian and migrant and  seasonal Head Start programs. It sets  aside 60 percent of new funds for activities such as teacher salaries, professional development and extended program hours. It suspends the flawed naKILDEE),  MILLER tional reporting system. It  improves  teacher qualifications. It increases access to Early Head Start. It improves  training and technical assistance to  help programs identify their strengths  and weaknesses. And it strengthens the  quality of Head Start boards and maintains  strong  parental  involvement  through  shared governance of Head  Start programs.  I would note that we are expecting a  motion to recommit that would allow  faith-based programs to discriminate  in hiring based on religion using Federal funds. Before supporting this bill  by 42–1, the committee considered and  rejected such a policy. Faith-based programs can and do participate in Head  Start and have done so for many years,  and I support that strongly. However,  this motion is wrong, and I encourage  my colleagues to oppose it.  In closing, I want to thank Chairman  for  his  outstanding  work  through the years on this program and  for his specific work this year. This is  a very good bill. I want to thank Ranking Members MCKEON and CASTLE, it  was really a pleasure to work with  them, and all the members of the committee for their hard work on this bill.  I would like to thank the staff, especially Ruth Friedman, Chairman MILLER’s senior policy adviser; Susan Ross  and  James Bergeron with Ranking  Member MCKEON; and Jessica Gross  with Ranking Member CASTLE; and  Lloyd Horwich of my staff.  Mr. Chairman, I look forward to passage of this bill today and to working  through the conference committee to  see that this bill becomes law.  ",2007
1000,32,2007-05-02,Mr. MCKEON.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 5  minutes at this time to the senior Republican on the subcommittee. I am  proud of all the work that he has done  to bring this bill to the floor last Congress and this Congress, the gentleman  from Delaware (Mr. CASTLE).  ",2007
1001,32,2007-05-02,Mr. CASTLE.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the distinguished ranking member of  the subcommittee for his kind words  and for yielding. I also obviously thank  Mr. MILLERand Mr. KILDEE for their  work on this, and Ms. WOOLSEY, who  has worked on it before with me. And I  am pleased to be able to be here.  I support the  legislation before us  today which will reauthorize the Head  Start program. And like almost every  other Member of this body, I believe  strongly in the benefits of this program. I trust that H.R. 1429, the Improving Head Start Act, will improve  Head Start by emphasizing that every  child, regardless of their economic status, should have the best chance possible to succeed.  In 1965, Head Start was created to  give economically disadvantaged children access to the same educational,  health, nutritional, social and other  services that were enjoyed by their  more affluent peers. The goal of the  program was, as it remains today, to  provide  children  a  solid  foundation  that will prepare them for success in  school and later in life.  As the centerpiece of the Federal  Government’s efforts to support quality early childhood education for our  Nation’s most  disadvantaged youth,  Head Start has served nearly 20 million  low-income children and their families.  Currently  Head  Start  serves  over  900,000 children every day and has over  1,600 grantees across the United States.  In my home State of Delaware, Head  Start programs serve over 2,000 children, with over 800 additional 3- and 4-  year-olds receiving assistance through  State government funding.  We all can agree on the need for Head  Start and its successes. We must also  recognize that Head Start can produce  even greater results for children. Students who attend Head Start programs  do start school more prepared than  those with similar backgrounds who do  not attend Head Start. However, Head  Start students continue to enter kindergarten well below national norms of  school readiness. By moving to close  the school readiness gap, this bill will  improve results for almost a million  Head Start students across the Nation.  Toward the goal of closing the readiness gap, the Improving Head Start Act  strengthens  Head  Start’s  academic  focus  while maintaining  its  comprehensive nature that is imperative to  its success. The bill improves the academic focus of the program by establishing new quality standards that ensure  enrolled  children  develop  and  demonstrate  language  skills;  prereading knowledge, including an interest  in and appreciation of books,  reading and writing; premathematics  knowledge, such as recognition of numbers and counting; cognitive abilities  related to academic achievement; and  social development important for environments constructive for child development, early learning and school success.  Research consistently demonstrates  a link between the learning potential  of children and the level of education  and training of classroom teachers. For  that reason, we improve the quality of  teachers in Head Start classrooms by  requiring that in time 50 percent of all  Head Start teachers nationwide must  have a baccalaureate degree.  b1500  As I am sure some of my colleagues  know, this bill does not include a proposed  State  demonstration  project,  which was incorporated into the legislation the House passed in 2003. I believe strongly, however, in the policy  goals of increased coordination and integration that were and continue to be  at the heart of efforts to remove barriers  and  prevent  collaboration  between Head Start and successful State  and local early childhood initiatives. I  believe the proposal to be offered by  TOMPRICEof Georgia would foster integration among quality early childhood programs, and plan on supporting  Mr. PRICE’s amendment.

1002,39,2007-05-02,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  strong support of the Improving Head Start Act  of 2007 (H.R. 1429).  Since 1965, Head Start has served millions  of  low-income  families and helped children  prepare for school. It is an essential program  and one whose success has a major impact  on children,  their  families,  their community,  and ultimately the future of our country. We  owe  it  to our children  to pass  this bill and  make improvements that strengthen and grow  the Head Start program.  Scientific research shows us that 80 percent  of brain development occurs by age 3 and 90  percent by age 5. Studies also show that education achievement gaps between poor and  minority students and affluent and non-minority students are already in place when children  begin elementary school. These achievement  gaps, once in place, tend to persist and are  exceedingly difficult to remedy. Head Start and  Early Head Start  are  effective  in  closing  achievement gaps and foster both short and  long-term success in participating children.  In addition to preparing children for success  in  school,  recent  research  clearly  demonstrates that children enrolled in Early Head  Start and their parents realize other very significant gains. Early Head Start children show  better approaches  to  learning, demonstrate  more appropriate  language acquisition, and  exhibit less aggressive behavior. Early Head  Start parents create a stronger home environment with more parent-child  reading and a  greater repertoire of discipline strategies. Early  Head Start  parents  also  show  significant  progress  toward  economic  self-sufficiency.  These  impacts are significant and  result  in  children with increased linguistic, cognitive, social and emotional competence. What better  investment could we be making for our children?  Unlike programs dreamed up by ideologues  in  the Bush Administration  like  ‘‘abstinence  only education’’ and ‘‘marriage promotion,’’ we  know  that Head Start works. Unfortunately,  less than half of eligible children are enrolled  in Head Start. Even worse, less than 5 percent of eligible  infants and  toddlers are enrolled in Early Head Start.  If we are serious about providing all children  with an opportunity to succeed in school and  in life, we must expand Head Start and particularly Early Head Start. This bill is a step in  that direction.  It will more  than double  the  amount of money available  to Early Head  Start programs. The bill will also expand services to infants and toddlers that are so crucial  to child development, but often difficult for parents  to access.  In addition,  the  Improving  Head Start Act will increase eligibility levels so  that children from families making up to 130  percent of the Federal poverty level can participate. This change is especially important in  areas of the country with high costs of living,  including my district where the poverty threshold is well below what it actually costs a family  to live.  This bill’s expansion of Early Head Start and  Head Start should be applauded. We cannot  lose sight, however, that these programs only  address the tip of the iceberg. This Congress  must focus more of our attention on all children birth to age 5 and guarantee that all families have access to high quality comprehensive early care and education programs. This  is an investment that our country must make  if we are serious about giving all of our children a chance at the American dream.  Despite the strong bipartisan support for this  legislation, the White House has indicated that  the President does not support this legislation  as written unless we insert a special interest  provision for the religious right. The President  and many Republicans want to allow religious  organizations  to discriminate  in  their hiring  practices. Religious organizations have been  Head Start providers since the program was  established and have done quite well playing  by the same rules that prohibit all employers  from discriminating. Pandering  rhetoric and  veiled threats from the White House will not  improve the life of a single family.  In closing, I hope that all of my colleagues  will see the importance of investing in our children and supporting families. I urge a ‘‘yes’’  vote on this legislation and a ‘‘no’’ vote on Republican attempts to turn this into a vehicle for  religious discrimination.  ",2007
1003,39,2007-05-02,Mr. WU.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation.  Head Start has proven its ability to improve  the lives of disadvantaged children. Numerous  studies have demonstrated that children who  attend Head Start come to school more prepared  than children who do not participate,  and  that  these effects  last over a period of  years.  I have personal experience with  the program—my wife, Michelle, was a Head Start  teacher for 7 years in Oregon. In her classes,  I saw  the children of  janitors and security  guards.  Their parents worked in the sparkling towers  of downtown Portland, but  they  themselves  never got  to visit downtown, except  in  their  Head Start field trips.  The Improving Head Start Act makes several needed changes to current law. It ends  the use of the National Reporting System—a  flawed  testing system  that has  tested over  500,000 4-year-olds, despite strong opposition  by child development experts.  The bill also improves current law by making clear that Head Start agencies must establish and maintain a formal structure of shared  governance with parent policy councils. This  will codify in law that parents have the ability  to shape and share a role in the success of  their local Head Start program.

1005,67,2007-05-02,Mr. MCKEON.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2007
1006,67,2007-05-02,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. Chairman,  I’d  yield 2 minutes to my good friend and  colleague from New York, JOHNHALL.  Mr. HALL of New York. Mr. Chairman, I won’t need that much time.  Thank you  to my colleague  from  Rhode Island and from the other side of  the floor, who just spoke in favor of  this amendment. I would like to take a  moment to commend all who support  this issue.  There are 27 Head Start facilities in  my district, and they provide critical  services to  families that want their  children to have every opportunity to  grow and succeed. I’m glad that the bill  we are considering today will expand  access to Head Start and help make  sure that America’s less well-off children can have a great chance of long-  term success when they arrive in our  schools.  The amendment will help to meet  these goals by providing more support  for  inclusive education. This  is  the  practice of teaching children with disabilities  in  the  same classrooms as  those without disabilities, and it has  largely been shown to have a positive  effect on the development of those children with disabilities.  The Head Start Act already requires  that 10 percent of enrollment slots go  to students with disabilities, and the  actual number of  enrollees  is  even  higher, at about 13 or 14 percent.  Although these classrooms can provide  increased  educational  benefits,  they also present teachers and staff  with increased demands. Teachers and  staff have often been forced to try to  handle greater responsibilities without  the necessary resources. This amendment would help to bridge that gap by  allowing training and technical assistance funds to be spent to enhance the  ability of classroom staff to meet the  needs of eligible children in inclusive  classrooms.  Providing more resources for teacher  training and support, this amendment  would make great strides in improving  the quality of the educational experience for all children in a class.  Another  fundamental  goal  of  the  Head Start program is to make sure  that all children have the best chance  of success in school and in life. The second provision of this amendment will  help to further serve those goals by  working to make sure that the inclusive classroom environment benefits  every student, including typically developing children. It would do so by allowing research and evaluation funding  to be used in further studying the impact of  inclusive classrooms on the  educational experience of children with  or without disabilities.  I urge my colleagues to support it.  ",2007

Head Start is a tremendously important program in the early childhood  education continuum, but  it  is also  desperately in need of reforms.  As we all know, the purpose of Head  Start is to help disadvantaged children  be better prepared to enter school. But  we are doing those children an enormous disservice and squandering taxpayer dollars if we do not hold the providers of Head Start services to a higher level of accountability. The existing  language in 1429 allows for automatic  5-year renewal of applications, automatic renewal,  if they simply meet  minimum standards to the satisfaction  of  the  review panel. Providers  that  don’t meet the standards must enter  into open competition for acceptance  of their applications. I would respectfully  submit  this  does not  go  far  enough.  For the sake of ensuring the programs are performing better than minimal or better than good enough and as  a safeguard for the taxpayers who foot  the bill, I believe we should require  that all Head Start providers face open  competition. Such competition will encourage a higher level of performance  and serve as a check on unscrupulous  practices.  Mr. Chairman, I am very familiar,  unfortunately, with what can happen  when a provider is allowed to skate  through without  the discipline  that  comes from competition. In my own  district, the Polk County Opportunity  Council became a poster child for mismanagement and abuse since its dealings first became public in 2003, which  actually had followed a probationary  status just several years before. Years  of investigation have revealed breath-  taking examples of malfeasance and  mendacity.  There  has  been  everything  from  sweetheart deals  involving  the purchase of office equipment to claims for  nonexistent hurricane damages, essentially amounting to insurance fraud.  At one point the PCOC even fabricated  a  false  ‘‘certificate  of  compliance’’  from the U.S. Department of Health  and Human Services, which it tried to  use to short-circuit other  investigations of  its misdealings.  It  took  3  years, 3 years, to defund that agency,  and the entire appeals process along  the way, and this only applies to the  Head Start program, the entire appeals  process was paid for not by the agency,  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:07 May 03, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K02MY7.108 H02MYPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007
1011,74,2007-05-02,Mr. SPACE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support  of  the  Space-Hare-Welch-Altmire  amendment to H.R. 1429.  Mr. Chairman, I believe that Head  Start is critical for our Nation’s working families. We are a Nation founded  on equality and opportunity for all. All  of our Nation’s children deserve the opportunity to participate in early childhood development programs regardless  as to the financial standing of their  families.  Head Start programs in rural areas  face many unique challenges in delivering services. The January 2007 report  from the National Advisory Committee  on Rural Health and Human Services  confirms the unfortunate reality that  rural Head Start  programs  are,  in  many ways, disadvantaged.  Simply put, in rural and geographically  isolated areas the distance between Head Start providers and participants is a significant mountain to  climb. Especially as gas prices continue  to  stretch both program and  household budgets, the cost of transportation can be prohibitive. These distances can also impede Head Start programs from reaching out to families eligible to participate. It is certainly a  tragedy when families can’t enjoy the  opportunities offered by Head Start  programs because  they didn’t know  about them, not because they weren’t  there.  I am particularly concerned about  barriers to parental involvement. I believe that parental  involvement  fostered by Head Start programs is incredibly important. There is no responsibility of our society more sacred or  profound  than  raising our  children.  Bringing parents together to share in  this experience strengthens our communities,  creating  bonds  that  can  bring them closer together.  In rural areas, parental involvement  is again a challenge. The realities of  less advantaged areas can keep parents  away from these programs. This is simply a missed opportunity to build our  communities.  I believe that H.R. 1429 offers significant improvements to rural Head Start  programs, and I applaud the work of  my colleagues on the Committee on  Education and Labor for making assistance to these areas a priority.  In particular, I wish to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. HARE) for his  amendment in committee that draws  attention to the challenges of teacher  retention and the recruitment of new  participants  in  our Nation’s  rural  areas.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2007
1012,74,2007-05-02,Mr. MCKEON.," Mr. Chairman, I rise to  claim the time in opposition, though I  am not opposed  to  the gentleman’s  amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the gentleman from California  is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  ",2007
1013,74,2007-05-02,Mr. MCKEON.," Mr. Chairman, I think  that  this  amendment makes  it  a  stronger bill. Rural grantees are more  likely to rely on home visits due to  problems associated with staffing and  transportation. Head Start  in-home  programs are required to make a minimum of 32 visits per year, or one per  week. In addition, there must be a minimum of 16 group socialization activities per year.  For this reason, I rise in support of  this amendment to provide additional  training and  support  to  rural Head  Start programs facing these challenges  to ensure that all children can access  the  skills  necessary  to  succeed  in  school.  I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2007
1014,74,2007-05-02,Mr. SPACE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. HARE).  ",2007
1015,74,2007-05-02,Mr. HARE.," I thank the gentleman for  yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I am honored to join  Congressmen  and  in  introducing this amendment to improve Head Start programs  for rural communities.  Much of my congressional district is  rural. Therefore, I am very sensitive to  the unique challenges that Head Start  centers and rural families face in providing or accessing Head Start programs. Some of these challenges  include  instructor shortages, access to  Head Start programs and outreach to  eligible families.  As a member of the Education and  Labor Committee, I had the privilege  of addressing these concerns during the  markup of this bill. The amendment we  present today expands those efforts by  directing the Education Secretary to  provide the technical assistance and  training to remove barriers to professional development, parental involvement, home visits and health screening  in rural areas.  ALTMIRE SPACE,  WELCH It is my hope that with this commitment from the Secretary and with the  addition of services geared towards the  needs of rural families, more eligible  children will enroll in and experience  the benefits of the Head Start program.  Rural communities consist of the low-  income populations that Head Start  was created to serve. Therefore, it is  critical that we address the challenges  these  communities  face  in  administering Head Start  to  ensure  that  those families have the access to the  opportunities they need and they so  much deserve.  Again,  I  thank my colleagues  for  helping me on this issue, and I urge all  Members to vote ‘‘yes’’ to improve the  rural Head Start program by passing  the Space-Hare-Welch-Altmire amendment.

1016,74,2007-05-02,Mr. SPACE.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. ALTMIRE).  ",2007
1017,74,2007-05-02,Mr. ALTMIRE.," Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman from Ohio for his  leadership on this issue, and I rise in  strong support of this amendment. I  am happy to lend my name to it, because this amendment simply says that  rural communities which have distinct  needs in Head Start programs will now  have a  level playing  field with the  changes that have been made under  H.R. 1429, which I strongly support.  This bill builds on Head Start’s proven success in a way that is going to  benefit parents and teachers who are  involved in the program. We want to  ensure through this amendment that  those  successes  carry  forward  into  rural communities, specifically as  it  relates  to professional development,  parental involvement, home visits and  health screenings.  So I am pleased to lend my name to  this. It is a great amendment, and I  thank the gentleman from Ohio for his  leadership.  ",2007

1019,74,2007-05-02,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman  from Ohio for offering this amendment  and  for bringing this perspective to  this legislation, along with Mr. HARE  and Mr. ALTMIREand Mr. WELCH, and  for representing the rural communities  and raising these issues during this debate and during the consideration of  this legislation.  Sometimes issues get overlooked in  the rush to reauthorize the bill and to  reauthorize it from a single perspective, so I appreciate this information  that they have brought to us. I think  the direction to the Secretary to review and to look at these barriers and  to see what we can do to remove them  so that we can assure both the participation of the children in the program  and of their families and their parents  as is designed by the law is important.  Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of  the amendment.

1024,81,2007-05-02,Mr. EDWARDS.," Mr. Speaker,  this  motion should be called the ‘‘religious  job discrimination act.’’  As a person of  faith who believes  strongly  in the good work of  faith-  based groups, I rise to passionately oppose this ill-advised motion, a motion  also opposed by the Baptist Joint Committee,  the American Jewish Committee, the Episcopal Church, and the  NAACP.  Our principle  is simple but deeply  profound.  No  American,  not  one,  should ever have to pass another American’s private religious test to qualify  for a tax-funded Federal job. Not one  American. Mr. Speaker,  I  shouldn’t  have to pass Mr. MCKEON’s test if I am  applying for a Head Start job program,  and he should not have to pass my religious test.  The fact is that no group in America,  which would be possible under this motion, should be able to accept a $1 million Head Start tax-funded grant and  then literally, with your tax dollars in  mind, put up a sign that says no Jews  nor Catholics need apply here for a federally funded job. To do so is morally  wrong. To do so  is constitutionally  wrong. No American, no American, not  one, should ever have to choose between being true to his or her private  religious faith and having a federally  funded, tax-funded job.  This motion will harm  the Head  Start program. It will harm the work  of faith-based groups. Vote ‘‘yes’’ for  Head Start and ‘‘no’’ for this motion to  recommit.  ",2007
1025,81,2007-05-02,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER).  ",2007
1026,81,2007-05-02,Mr. CLEAVER.," Mr. Speaker, I have  been  the  pastor  of  the St. James  United Methodist Church for 33 years.  The bishop gives me the authority to  bring pastors onto our staff, and I discriminate. I have five pastors. All of  them are Methodists, and they are paid  with Methodist dollars. Each one of  them. They are paid out of the stewardship of the church, and I have the  right to do that. But I don’t have the  right to accept Federal dollars and discriminate.  Minorities have come to Washington  over the years because this was the  seat of power and it was believed that  if you could get close to the seat of  power, freedom would be more available. The same thing holds true with  dollars. People go to work for the Federal Government, and if they see dollars going to a Head Start program,  they believe automatically that there  will  be no  discrimination. And we  should not, we  should not,  turn  it  around now.  ",2007
1027,81,2007-05-02,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT).  ",2007
1028,81,2007-05-02,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker,  a few weeks ago, Don Imus provoked a  national discussion about  race, but  that was just talk. If we pass this motion, we will take action and turn the  clock back before 1965.  This amendment doesn’t allow faith-  based programs  to get  funded. The  Shuler amendment that we passed reminds us  that  faith-based organizations can and do sponsor Head Start  programs.  The fact is that any program that  can be funded under this amendment  could be funded anyway if they would  agree not to discriminate in employment. It has nothing to do with symbols. It is absurd to suggest that this  has  anything  to  do with  symbols.  Whatever problem there is with symbols is a constitutional problem that  cannot be solved with a motion to recommit.  This is all about discrimination. And  if you can discriminate based on religion,  it has  racial  implications. So  since the 1960s, for 40 years, when you  talk about civil liberties, you are talking about the victims of discrimination. We decided 40 years ago that it  was so reprehensible to discriminate in  employment that we made it illegal,  even with your own private money.  And today, as we talk about discrimination, we ought to think about the  victims, not the right of the person to  discriminate against the victim.  The present law allows the church to  use its own church money, as the gentleman  from Missouri  said,  to hire  whom they want. But with Federal  money, just with the Federal money,  you have not been able to discriminate.  So for 40 years, all children in Head  Start programs have learned that their  parents are eligible to be hired by the  Head Start program regardless of the  race or religion of the program. They  have known that for over 40 years. This  amendment will determine what the  next generation of Head Start students  will learn.  We need to defeat this amendment.  ",2007

1035,95,2007-05-02,Mr. BAIRD.," I thank the gentleman  from California. Just a couple of brief  comments, and it’s getting late, so we  don’t want to carry this forever.  I would suggest that we all agree  that consistency is a very dangerous  thing. If the gentleman talks about  being consistent, I would ask the gentleman why they chose not to micromanage the vast expenditures of dollars, not even to have oversight hearings of the vast expenditure of dollars  on the war.  If you really want to save the taxpayer dollars, we are burning $2.5 billion a week in Iraq. This entire bill is  $21 billion over 3 years. We’re talking  about 3 full years to fund the basic scientific research of this entire Nation,  from mathematics to physics to chemistry to social sciences. That’s about 6  or 7 weeks or so of what you spend in  Iraq. And yet when it came to oversight of the expenditures in Iraq, the  majority,  then-majority  party  was  then just virtually silent. If you really  want to save the taxpayers’ money,  and I do, you could have  looked at  that.  But  let me suggest what the gentleman from New Jersey misrepresents.  And I asked earlier if any folks on the  other side were qualified to study this.  The gentleman from New Jersey just  doesn’t seem to understand how this  legislation works. He completely misrepresented when he said that it is incumbent upon the majority and the  chairman who is bringing this forward  to defend these studies. Sir, this bill  does not  authorize  specific  studies.  That is not how the authorizing language for the National Science Foundation works. It would be ludicrous, and  you should know that; and if you don’t  know it, you are not qualified to speak  to this. But it would be ludicrous to  suggest  that when you authorize a  foundation, that you are authorizing  every single specific study or that you  know what all those specific studies  are. That’s  not  how  the National  Science Foundation works. That’s not  how we authorize it. That’s not how  this bill functions. And it’s indeed not  how many, many of the authorizing  bills function here. So to suggest that,  to bring forward a broad authorization  bill that gives responsibility to a foundation, one has to justify every single  study is to misrepresent how this legislation works. And that’s the problem. I  think the gentleman either misunderstands or misrepresents how the legislation works.  I thank the gentleman  fornia for yielding.  The Acting CHAIRMAN  (Mr. ANDREWS). The question is on the amendfrom Caliment offered by the gentleman from  California (Mr. CAMPBELL).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes  appeared to have it.

1037,95,2007-05-02,Mr. CAMPBELL of California.," Mr.  Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amendment No. 4 offered by Mr. CAMPBELL  of California:  At the end of section 3, add the following  new subsection:  (h) REDUCTION.—Each of the amounts authorized to be appropriated or made available under this section shall be reduced by 1  percent.  ",2007
1038,95,2007-05-02,Mr. CAMPBELL of California.," Mr.  Chairman, my colleague  from Washington mentioned that he didn’t think  this last amendment that I proposed  was the correct way to save money, so  perhaps this is the more correct way;  maybe this is something that he would  find more to his liking.  H.R. 1867, this bill before us, would  increase  spending  for  the National  Science Foundation by 9.9 percent in  the first year, 7.4 percent in the second  year and 7.3 percent in the third year,  for an increase of over 25 percent over  a 3-year period. Now, Mr. Chairman,  that is an amount, and I, too, am someone who has sympathy for some of the  things that the National Science Foundation does. However, even over the  last few years where we have had very  large percentage increases in our revenues to the Federal Government, they  haven’t been as large as this over the  last 3-year period. In fact, in the next  3-year  period,  any  of  the  prognosticators, whether it be the Office of  Management and Budget or any of the  other prognosticators, are not  estimating that we will have a 25 percent  increase  in revenue over the next 3  years. So therefore, this proposes to increase spending at a rate greater than  revenue is projected to increase over  the next 3 years.  This amendment would simply reduce the amount of this increase by 1  percent per year. So instead of increasing by 10 percent the  first year,  it  would increase by only 9; instead of increasing by 7.4 percent, the second year  would increase by 6.4 percent; and 7.3  percent, it would increase by 6.3 percent in the third year. These are still  large  annual  increases,  larger  than  most taxpayers at home are likely to  see the increases in their incomes, in  their salaries, in their wages.  So this is just a small reduction. It  does not deal with, as the gentleman  from Washington mentioned,  it does  not specifically say what, it leaves that  issue open. So, therefore, it does not  interfere with the selection of these  various proposals and research things  that the gentleman from Washington  just supported in the last amendment.  So with that, Mr. Chairman, I would  ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote.  ",2007
1039,95,2007-05-02,Mr. BAIRD.," Mr. Chairman, I move to  strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, here’s  the problem  with what the gentleman is proposing,  however well-intentioned  it may be.  And I am deeply concerned; as the gentlemen know, I serve on the Budget  Committee with some of the gentlemen  who are speaking, and we are all concerned about the long-term deficit picture for this country. However, if you  cut investments in scientific research  and scientific education, in the long  run you will increase the deficit of this  country, and you will decrease our national  security, our national health  care  and  our  national  and  international competitiveness. That is why  this is a mistake.  And don’t just take my word for it.  The National Academies of Science, in  Rising Above the Gathering Storm, a  2005 publication, called for more than a  10 percent increase; the U.S. Commission on National Security, the Hart-  Rudman report, a similar level of increase; the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, in  their publication, Assessing the U.S.  R&D Investment in 2003; a coalition of  15 industry associations, in the publication Tapping America’s Potential, in  2005; the Council on Competitiveness in  their publication, Innovate America.  This is not just a Democratic proposal or Republican proposal. I would  remind the gentleman that this bill  passed unanimously out of committee  with bipartisan support.  I would also encourage you to ask  your faculty administrators, ask your  high  technology  industries,  do you  think this country is spending sufficient quantities on fundamental basic  research and investment such as that  funded by National Science Foundation? And do you think we are doing  enough to keep our young people educated in science and math in ways such  as  supported  by  this  legislation?  I  guarantee you most of them would say  no. You would, I think, by this cutting,  with due respect, significantly be impairing, and  it sounds  like a small  measure, but remember, we are already  falling behind in a number of areas in  science and math, not only in the education, but in the applied fields.  This  is  consistent with President  Bush’s own administration request of a  7 percent per year increase. Again, this  is a bipartisan approach, not a Democratic or Republican approach. The  President has  called  for  this. And  again, as Dr. EHLERSsaid so eloquently  earlier, our return on investment from  research is profound. And when you cut  that investment, I think you’re cutting  that return on investment.  ",2007

I appreciate the valiant effort on behalf of my friend from Washington in  attempting to dissuade Members from  voting against this amendment, which  I think is well founded. I appreciate the  gentleman from Arizona for offering it.  I would remind the gentleman from  Washington that one of the roles of our  office, one of the roles of our office is  to assist individuals with grant applications. So there are other resources  which the Federal Government supplies  for individuals who are searching to  try to fill out their grant applications.  We are happy to help.  I would also suggest, Mr. Chairman,  that the gentleman makes the point,  appropriately, that only 25 percent of  the grants are accepted. So why should  we waste Federal dollars on teaching  individuals who have other avenues to  be able to determine how to fill out  their grant application appropriately?  Why should we waste precious Federal dollars that could go to, in fact,  the kinds of cures that he is endeavoring to fund with the moneys that he is  promoting? Why should we waste those  Federal dollars in this kind of endeavor, which, I think, is frankly ill-founded and not needed.  I am pleased to yield to my good  friend from Arizona.  ",2007

First, he mentioned that  the private sector groups are in support of this  legislation and the National Science Foundation. I have no  doubt. It doesn’t surprise me at all.  But I would submit that that’s akin to  the government saying we are in a position now to fund free lunches for everyone out there, and you can do it on  the government’s dime.  I would say that virtually every company in America would say that’s a  great idea. Now we don’t have to fund  that. We don’t have to subsidize it for  our employees. We can keep the profits, invest them elsewhere. If private  companies don’t have to expend that  money  in  their R&D budgets,  they  would like not to. But that was a point  I made,  that  this  often  supplants  money that would be invested in the  private  sector,  probably more  efficiently if overall government spending  is any guide.  To the amendment in specific, the  gentleman from Georgia said it well.  With all the high-priority items in the  National Science Foundation budget,  to take money out of that and to give  it to those who didn’t present a successful proposal would seem to me not  the highest-priority use of money.  Remember, this is a new program. I  am not cutting a program that exists.  This is a new pilot project. I just don’t  think this is a road that we want to go  down. I started to mention, before my  time ran out before, we have seen this  in other fields, in other earmark fields,  where people are funding business consortiums. Many of the earmarks in this  body go to business consortiums to  help them draft grant proposals to get  other earmarks or to get grants from  government or to  lobby to get earmarks. It’s simply not a road that we  want to go down as a Congress, I would  submit.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",2007
1043,102,2007-05-02,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," I thank the  gentleman, and I commend him for his  amendment.  I am pleased to yield to my good  friend from Michigan.  ",2007
1044,102,2007-05-02,Mr. EHLERS.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  First, to the gentleman  from Arizona, I totally agree with your comments about earmarks. I have fought  hard here to keep this body and the  other body  from providing earmarks  for  scientific  research,  because  all  grants should go through the peer review process.  I might also add parenthetically that  when the gentleman from Arizona was  on the antiearmark bandwagon a few  years ago, I believe I voted with him  more than most Members of the House,  because I oppose earmarks in general,  but particularly in scientific research.  I would also comment that the fact  that industry supports us is not indicative of the National Science Foundation  doing  industry’s  research. National Science Foundation does  the  basic  research,  the  fundamental  research, which has no apparent immediate use. Industry picks up on that  and says, okay, let’s see whether we  can develop something out of that. In  other words, industry does not do very  much research, they do a lot of development. NSF does almost totally research and essentially no development.  So it’s a very good symbiotic relationship.  As I mentioned earlier, before most  of the people here were on the floor,  the  rate of  return on our  research  money in the National Science Foundation has been incredible. Any accountant looking at this would say this is  the best investment that the United  States Government makes because it  has great results in our economy.  The Acting CHAIRMAN.

In the midst of all this serious debate  about an extremely important bill, I  would like to pause just a moment to  have a lighter moment that we can all  enjoy as we recognize that one of our  leading Members in this Congress tomorrow reaches a major milestone. The  ranking member of the Science Committee, the gentleman from Texas, Mr.  RALPHHALL, tomorrow will begin the  second half of his life. He reaches the  age of 84 tomorrow. So we can all celebrate with him and appreciate the tremendous contributions he has made to  this Congress and to this country.

Congratulations, RALPH. You are a  dear friend and a model to many of us,  and I very much appreciate all your  service.  I also want to thank Chairman GORDON for his leadership in not only this  bill but the entire innovation agenda  that has been moving  through  this  Congress so efficiently and with, again,  good bipartisan support.  I mentioned Mr. EHLERS repeatedly  earlier tonight. He has been so central  to the passage of this bill. And I especially want to thank the majority staff  and the minority staff. We have worked  very well together.  And I want to thank my dear friends  and  colleagues  on  the  other  side.  Though we have had a spirited disagreement on some issues and agreed  on some, it has been a civil debate, a  well-intentioned debate, and I think it  has advanced our discussion of the important role of this legislation.  The amendment by the gentleman  from Georgia has been offered before.  It has been defeated before on other  bills. I would urge its defeat. And after  we accomplish that, I would urge passage of this otherwise outstanding bill.  ",2007

1055,116,2007-05-02,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to honor the memory of C.W.  Matthews, a long-term businessman in  Cobb County, Georgia. Mr. Matthews  passed away on Sunday at the age of 84,  and with his passing, our Nation lost of  one of its most inspired industrialists  In the 1940s, a 23-year-old Matthews  established  the C.W. Matthews Contracting Company, which today is the  largest  highway  contractor  in  the  southeastern United States. C.W. was a  natural businessman, making  friends  with ease, growing his company the  old-fashioned way, through hard work.  Over the past 60 years, the company  has employed thousands of workers,  built many of the roads that help Cobb  County thrive, and even worked on the  expansion at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson airport.  In  fact, Mr. Matthews,  with only an eighth-grade education,  created one of the most successful family-run businesses in the Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I want to tell Mr. Matthews’ wife, Myrtle, of 66 years, his two  sons, two grandsons, and seven great-  grandchildren, the entire Cobb County  community shares in your loss. We will  always remember C.W. as a man of passion, drive and ingenuity.  I ask all my colleagues to join me in  honoring the legacy of C.W. Matthews.  f  REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER  AS COSPONSOR OF H.

1061,116,2007-05-02,Ms. LINDA T.," SA´NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to  draw the attention of the House and  the Nation to Public Service Recognition Week, which will take place May 7  through May 13.  This week is set aside to remind us  all of the vital work that public employees do every day across our country and to honor that work. In many  ways, public employees are the daily  embodiment of our democracy. Every  day they carry out the programs and  services chosen by our elected government from the Federal to the State to  the local level.  Locally, where democracy has the  most direct impact, public employees  carry out the programs of elected city  councils and school districts as they  teach  our  children,  run  parks  and  recreation programs, police our neighborhoods, and perform a myriad of  other services to make our communities continually better places to live.  Public employees are there for us, the  public, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In  the middle of the night when a water  main breaks and floods a street, when  a home catches fire, or when a terrorist  threat is identified, it is public employees who respond for our communities  and for our Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I am continually impressed with the creativity and innovation of public-sector employees and  leaders, as they deliver better services  and value to the public, whether it’s  creatively  combining  scarce government resources to improve public safety,  or  teaming up  government  resources with community volunteers to  provide needed home improvements for  disabled seniors, or finding new ways  to reduce air and water pollution. I  think the public would be impressed to  know that their tax dollars do have  many good stewards who take pride in  bringing them the best possible service  for their tax dollars. My own mother is  a public school teacher, so I know from  experience how gifted public servants  are at providing first-class services on  a steerage budget.  On May 9 in Los Angeles, public employees representing a wide variety of  Federal, State and  local government  agencies and school districts will gather  for a Public Service Recognition  Week ceremony. Thirteen individuals,  teams and projects will be honored as  winners of the public service recognition awards for outstanding contributions and service to the public.  Over  200  individuals,  teams  and  projects were  nominated  for  these  awards. Since I will be performing my  own duty as a public servant on May 9  here in this House, I want to take this  opportunity to extend my appreciation  and congratulations to everyone who  will attend that Los Angeles ceremony  and ceremonies like it all across our  Nation.  Let me conclude by urging all of my  colleagues to honor their public employees by cosponsoring House Resolution 307, which would  formally designate  Public  Service  Recognition  Week and to support public service recognition  events  in  their  districts  around the Nation in the coming week.  f  ",2007

1064,123,2007-05-02,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, the Senate  will now begin a 60-minute period of  morning business, the majority controlling the first half, Republicans controlling the  final portion. Following  the usage of all morning business, we  will resume consideration of S. 1082,  the FDA authorization legislation.  Yesterday, Senator DORGAN offered  an amendment  relating  to drug  reimportation. A  cloture motion was  filed on that last night. The cloture  vote will  occur  tomorrow morning.  Amendments in the second degree to  the Dorgan amendment would have to  be  filed 1 hour prior to the cloture  vote. I hope other Members who have  amendments will file them as quickly  as possible, to work with the managers.  We have Senators KENNEDY and ENZI  who are handling the legislation. They  have a good relationship. They have  done a lot already on this complicated  legislation.  Yesterday, I indicated to the staff on  both sides of the aisle that it may be  necessary to have votes as early as  noon on Monday. I hope we can finish  the FDA bill tomorrow. If we can, then  likely there would be no votes and we  would move to other legislation, which  would be WRDA, which has passed the  House overwhelmingly. It came out of  committee under the guidance of Senators BOXERand INHOFE, and we should  be able to finish that bill next week.  Immigration is still on line to come  up in the last 2 weeks of this work period. Next Wednesday, a week  from  today, I will rule XIV legislation that  will put us in line to move to this during the last 2 weeks of this work period.  It  is  legislation that  is badly  needed. We have had numerous meetings  of Democratic  and Republican  Senators that have been going on for  about 3 months. Progress has not been  as we anticipated on either side, but we  are going to move to this. Something  has to be done. If we don’t complete  this legislation over here, then it certainly won’t be done this year. Next  year, a Presidential election year will  make it very difficult. The three areas,  of course, that are of concern are border security, and it is necessary that  we visit that to see what can be done;  with temporary workers, a pathway to  legalization for the 12 million people  who are here with bad paper; then we  have to finally make sure we do something to make sure the employer sanctions aspect of the law is meaningful.  At the present time, it is not. We have  a lot to do there. I have had conversations with Senator KENNEDY, Senator  LEAHY, and a number of other interested Senators over the  last several  weeks, including Senator KYLand others on the Republican side.  Mr. President, the President did veto  the  spending bill we  sent him  last  night. It is unfortunate, but he did veto  it. There will be a veto-override vote in  the House tonight,  it  is my understanding.  The first piece of legislation dealing  with another bill to send to the President will come to us from the House. I  have had a number of consultations  with Speaker PELOSI. At this stage, we  are going to wait and see what happens  at the White House today. The ball is  in the President’s court. He has to  come forward with something that is  satisfactory to Democrats and a significant number of Republicans.  There has to be some change of direction in the war.

1065,130,2007-05-02,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, in a  few moments we will hear from Senator DODD, who was the architect for  the whole undertaking in terms of testing for children, and also for the children’s prescription drug program which  has been immensely successful. He deserves great credit for it. I am sure he  gets a great deal of satisfaction from  it.  It was bipartisan, with Senator  DeWine, going back many years, and  certainly Senator CLINTON has added  an additional dimension to this whole  proposal. But Senator DODDhas studied this issue very carefully, and he  really is the originator of the concept.  He has followed it closely, and he will  speak to the Senate on this matter in  a very short time.  I see my friend from Ohio on the Senate floor, who also wishes to address it,  but I will just say a brief word. I believe what we have in the legislation,  which was earlier fashioned by the Senator from Connecticut, is the way to  go, and I would hope the Allard amendment will not be accepted.  One of the major elements  in the  FDA bill is the program providing incentives for developing the new drugs,  and Senator DODD, Senator CLINTON,  Senator ALEXANDER, and many others  have been champions of this program,  as was our former colleague, Senator  DeWine. The reauthorization of an effective program is an opportunity to  strengthen  those aspects  that work  well and to improve those that need adjustment. Senator DODD took up this  challenge and renewed the information  about how the program has worked  over the years since Congress last reviewed it.  He found that companies were sometimes rewarded with billions of dollars  in additional sales in return for doing  studies that cost them only a few million. Clearly, one must provide incentives to develop new drugs for children,  but we must be responsible in doing so.  That is why in this reauthorization,  Senator DODD included a proposal to  adjust the period of market exclusivity  for drugs that generate over a billion  dollars in sales. If they generate over a  billion dollars  in sales, these blockbuster drugs will receive only 3 months  of exclusivity  instead of  6 months,  available to other drugs.  The Allard amendment would delete  this  sensible provision and give all  drugs the full 6 months. That could be  worth billions of dollars for a major  medication. Those  extra  6 months  don’t just apply to sales for use in children,  they apply  to all  sales. That  means a heart drug tested in children  would get 6 months protection  from  competition, so it can wrack up big returns.  The amendment we face embodies a  policy that has no proportionality. It  gives the same broad protection to a  drug such as Lipitor or Xanax as it  does to a specialty drug that might be  helpful  in treating ear  infections  in  children. Senator DODD’s proposal has  that sense of proportional reward, but  the amendment overturns it. That is  the wrong approach, and I hope the  Senate will reject it.  Mr. President, I see my friend and  colleague from Ohio wishes to address  this issue, and I yield the floor.  ",2007
1066,130,2007-05-02,Mr. BROWN.," Mr. President, I thank  Senator KENNEDY, and I want to join  my colleagues, and I will precede Senator DODD and join him and Senator  KENNEDYand others in urging a ‘‘no’’  vote on the amendment offered by the  Senator from Colorado.  Drugmakers, as we know, have exclusive rights to market a prescription  drug under a patent. That means no generic drugs are allowed on the market.  There  is no  price  competition  and  nothing to prevent drugmakers from  charging top dollar for their products.  Top dollar, as many of our constituents  know all too well, for a prescription  drug can be breathtaking. A 30-day  supply of Nexium, the little purple pill,  costs about $193; a 30-day supply of  Exelon, an Alzheimer’s drug, is $214; a  30-day supply of Pravachol, a statin  drug, is $168. Under current law—under  current law—drugmakers are rewarded  an additional 6 months of competition-  VerDate Aug 31 2005  23:44 May 02, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G02MY6.043 S02MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007
1067,137,2007-05-02,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President,  for  the benefit of the Members and the  greatest convenience, we will vote on  the Allard amendment at 12:25.

1073,144,2007-05-02,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr. President, I join  my colleagues in recognizing the fine  work that Senator DODDhas done in  the area of  children and  children’s  health. He recognized one decade ago  how important it was to have incentives in place for drug companies to  properly label drugs so they are available and a physician has some guidance  when they are putting therapy out.  I particularly thank Dr. COBURN for  bringing a message to the floor that reflects his practical experience, in a period of time when there weren’t a lot of  drugs specifically labeled for children,  to help him establish the proper dosage  and to be aware of the side effects that  may happen  to various age groups.  Also, I thank the Senator from North  Carolina for his comments.  I think I bring a certain degree of  practical experience to this debate as a  veterinarian. We are frequently put in  a  position where we have  to  recommend  drugs  for  therapy without  having had research done. You have to  extrapolate what you think might happen. The drug companies will do research on those products on which they  can make a profit. I am talking about  veterinary  prescription  drugs  right  now. There is a plethora of medications  available in the human market. Many  times,  in treating eye conditions or  some exotic problem in a species where  there isn’t much of a market, we have  to take the scientific literature that  we know, and perhaps we know what  the  reaction may be  in humans or  maybe in some other species, where the  drug company has done the research to  reflect what the adequate dosage  is,  and we extrapolate that and predict as  best we can what the reaction and how  effective that drug may be at a certain  dosage.  I think our children’s health is too  valuable to put a physician in a position where they have to make those  sorts of subjective evaluations. I happen to believe the incentives we put in  place a decade ago are working. That  belief is substantiated by people who  have looked at the program—the Best  Pharmaceuticals for Children Act—and  what happened as a result of that. I am  not the only one who believes that. We  had a study by the GAO, whose responsibility it is to look at programs to see  whether they are working. They give  this program a strong A. It is working.  I don’t think we ought to be messing  with a program that has worked. Three  months may be adequate, but there are  a lot of other drugs that we have to  still get on the market.  Several  years  back,  during  the  Reagan administration—and it might  have been President Reagan who said  it—there was a general belief in Washington that if it is making a profit,  let’s tax it; if it is working, let’s regulate it to death. Here is a program that  is working because we have backed off  on the rules and regulations. I don’t  think we ought to be making a decision, in light of the work that has yet  to be done in moving pediatric medications to the market, to mess with this.  Maybe 10 years from now it might be  even more appropriate; I don’t know.  This  is, to a certain degree, subjectivity. I think we have a huge need in  making sure we have adequate medications available to treat children.  I agree with many of my colleagues  that we should not be messing with a  program that works, and we need to  support this. I also wish to point out  that this doesn’t have an impact. There  is not a budget point of order on this  particular amendment. It doesn’t add  to the deficit of this country. So it is a  program we can move forward on, without increasing the cost to the Federal  Government.  I hope my colleagues will join me in  supporting this most important amendment because it is very important, it is  important to the practitioner who is  trying to provide the best care that scientists will allow him to provide to patients—in  this case, children.  If we  don’t keep these choices available for  the practitioner, then what happens is  he doesn’t have the options he should  have to give the best care to our children?  So for our children’s health in the future,  I think we need to pass this  amendment and go back to current  law, which has been working so very  well for us today.  ",2007

1078,144,2007-05-02,Mr. ENZI.," Mr. President, I, too, encourage people  to get  their amendments to us, so we can talk about the  amendments. The amendment process  is a difficult thing around here because  it doesn’t allow for some of the tweaks  noticed by people who have expertise in  that area. If we get to talk about them  first, sometimes there can be modifications to them before they are put in.  We want to move this along and have  some things to vote on at 4 o’clock  today. I hope everybody will cooperate  on it.  I thank Senator KENNEDY and his  staff and my staff who have been working together with anybody who has an  amendment. They were working at 3  and 4 o’clock this morning on different  things, trying to get them ironed out  so that it would be possible to move  the bill forward.  Mr. President, what’s wrong with  limiting  exclusivity  for  blockbuster  drugs? It is the exact opposite of what  we should do. The whole point of the  law is to leverage the large adult market for the benefit of the smaller kids’  market. The effect of the cap will be to  discourage companies  from  studying  the effects of  the most-widely used  drugs on kids. Seventy-five percent of  the drugs are not being studied under  the current incentive. We need more  studied, not less.  Are not  companies  only  studying  blockbuster drugs that make the most  money, not the drugs needed most in  kids? No. According to a Tufts University study, only about 10 percent of  drugs with pediatric exclusivity are  blockbusters. GAO says most products  obtaining exclusivity have annual sales  of less than $200 million.  Do companies get to choose the drugs  they study?

1079,151,2007-05-02,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President,  I  join  with the ranking member of the HELP  Committee—the  Health,  Education,  Labor,  and Pensions Committee—in  raising the concerns and agreeing with  the concerns he has raised about the  reimportation proposal which has come  forward from the Senator from North  Dakota, which has been debated on this  floor a number of times.  The issue, of course, is the safety and  efficacy of products which Americans  buy. The FDA has been given the responsibility and has executed that responsibility  extraordinarily well  to  make sure when an American citizen  buys a pharmaceutical product or a  medication, it is what it says it is and  it does what the doctor prescribes.  If  you  start  buying medications  internationally, you are in the position  where you have no capacity  for the  FDA to monitor that purchase. So the  drug may be represented to be an FDA-  approved drug, but it could easily not  be. In fact, case after case has been discovered of adulterated and  changed  medication coming into this country  under the representation the medication which is being purchased is medication which has been approved by the  FDA. So you are basically opening up a  massive loophole in the area of safety  for the American citizenry.  Now, the demand for this comes from  the cost of the drugs. People want to be  able to go across the border to Canada,  which is obviously a very sophisticated  nation, and buy a pharmaceutical product  there, which costs  significantly  less  than  the  same  pharmaceutical  product may cost in the United States.  That is a natural instinct of the market economy and of people. But critical  to this exercise, of course, is the ability to get a safe drug.  If you go across the border, and you  buy a pharmaceutical product which is  alleged to be one thing, and it turns  out to be another thing, the damage it  causes you is going to be economically  much more significant than the savings which you may have accomplished  by purchasing that drug across the border.  Also, it should be noted that with the  Part D pharmaceutical program which  we now have relative to Medicare, the  pressure—because  pharmaceutical  products are now insured and people receive them under the insurance plan as  created under  the Part D program,  which has been an extraordinary success  to  supplying  pharmaceuticals,  though  its  cost  remains  extraordinarily expensive for the next generation of Americans—but pharmaceutical  products are now available under an insurance program  to most American  seniors, and, as a result, if you are a  senior, one of the people most likely to  use a large number of drugs, and most  often are on a fixed income and have  problems purchasing drugs as a result  of the  fixed  income situation—those  issues were addressed by Part D to a  large degree relative to the senior purchasing drugs; and it did create the ancillary problem of creating a huge cost  which has to be borne by the next generation—but relative to the supplying  of drugs, the pressure which was forcing people to take the chance of purchasing  a  drug  internationally  has  been relieved to some degree, significantly in the area of senior citizens.  I proposed language which would create a safe pharmaceutical approach,  where you would create an Internet  pharmacy approach, where you would  create a regime under the FDA where  people could go on the Internet and  buy pharmaceutical products knowing  they have been approved by the FDA.  Today, unfortunately, that is not the  case. If you go on the Internet, and you  purchase something through a pharmaceutical firm off the Internet, you do  not know whether that product—even  though  it may be represented to be  FDA-approved—is  FDA-approved  because there is no way to certify the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:59 May 03, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G02MY6.045 S02MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007
1080,158,2007-05-02,Mr. BROWN.," Mr. President,  I rise  today to offer the Brownback-Brown  amendment, No. 985, which provides incentives for pharmaceutical companies  to develop and manufacture treatments  for neglected tropical diseases. According to the World Health Organization,  more than 1 billion people—that is one  of every six people worldwide—are affected by at least one neglected tropical  disease.  In  addition,  neglected  tropical diseases claim roughly 500,000  lives every year. However, less than 1  percent of the roughly 1,400 drugs registered between 1975 and 1999 treated  such diseases.  This disparity is obviously due to the  lack of financial incentives for pharmaceutical  companies  to  bring  neglected tropical disease treatments to  market  because  these  diseases  disproportionately  affect  low-income  countries, mainly in Africa. Creating  incentives for companies to invest in  treatments  for these diseases  is not  only in our country’s national interest,  but  it  is consistent with  the  longstanding tradition of this country of  caring for those less fortunate around  the world.  This amendment would award a priority review voucher to any company  that brings a neglected tropical disease  treatment to market. Priority review  is an existing FDA process by which  drugs are reviewed in 6 months as opposed to the average time of 18 months.  This priority review voucher would be  transferable and could be applied to  any drug in a company’s pipeline.  This voucher, which would be worth  hundreds of millions of dollars for a  company with a new blockbuster drug,  would also benefit consumers. That is  because it would give consumers earlier access to a new prescription drug.  Most importantly, creating incentives  for pharmaceutical companies to develop and manufacture neglected tropical disease treatments will obviously  save lives.  I commend Senator BROWNBACK for  his hard work on behalf of impoverished populations who desperately need  our attention. He is offering Members  of this body the opportunity to simultaneously save lives in developing nations, get U.S. consumers access to new  medicines more quickly, and engage  the drug industry in a win-win proposition. It is a rare opportunity, and I  urge Members on both sides of the aisle  to  support  the  Brownback-Brown  amendment.  AMENDMENTNO. 1011  Mr. President, I would like to make a  few comments on two other amendments, the  first being the Stabenow  amendment, which I have also cosponsored, along with Senators LOTT and  THUNE. That amendment will save U.S.  taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars while restoring the integrity of the  citizen petition process. That is important because the citizen petition process  is  fundamental  to our Nation’s  democratic system.  Under U.S. law, individuals and organizations have the right and should  have the right to petition the Federal  Government, which is another way of  saying they have a right to communicate their views and have their views  heard. The Federal Government  is,  after all, an employee of the American  people. Americans absolutely  should  have the right to weigh in on Government policies and actions.  Unfortunately,  some  brand-name  pharmaceutical companies have regularly  exploited  the  citizen  petition  process, filing frivolous petitions solely  for the purpose of delaying the approval of generic drugs. They have been  quite successful at it. Since 2003, brand  drug companies have filed dozens and  dozens of citizen petitions trying to  stop or delay FDA approval of competing  generic  products. Ninety-five  percent—roughly 19 in 20—of these petitions  have  been  denied  outright.  What about the other 5 percent? FDA  either hasn’t acted on them or has approved them in whole or in part because they had no other choice—the  brand companies had simply reiterated  a factual issue that had already been  addressed by FDA. In other words, even  the approved petitions, the approved 5  percent, were frivolous.  While drugmakers waste FDA’s time  and taxpayers’ money, American patients are forced to continue paying  top dollar—the name-brand price—for  the medicines they need. Frivolous citizen petitions have created delays that  often range from 11 to 15 months, preventing price competition  for drugs  that generate millions of dollars in revenue each day. American consumers—  American taxpayers, who help finance  Medicare, Medicaid, and VA health  care—can’t afford it. These costs are  borne not just by consumers and taxpayers but also employers.  I have worked closely with Senator  STABENOW to make sure this amendment doesn’t interfere with the right of  individuals or companies to petition  FDA and that the amendment ensures  these  individuals  that  the  concerns  raised in their petitions will still be  taken  seriously by FDA. What  this  amendment  does  do  is  fight  back  against  the unjustifiable and costly  delays caused by  frivolous petitions  submitted for the express purpose of  blocking price competition in the marketplace.  No one, not the drug industry or any  other industry, should be allowed to  make a mockery of one of our democratic rights—the right to petition our  Government—particularly at  the expense of patients and taxpayers. Ms.  STABENOW’s amendment,  cosponsored  by Senator THUNEand Senator LOTT,  will put a stop to a tactic which is as  costly as it is unethical. I urge every  Member of this body to support it.  AMENDMENTNO. 990  Mr. President, I also would briefly  speak out on the Dorgan reimportation  amendment,  joining Senators GRASSLEYand STABENOWand so many others  in both parties in supporting the reimportation amendment.  Some time ago, about 10 years ago,  from my northeast Ohio congressional  district when I served in the House of  Representatives, along with the Presiding Officer, I used to sponsor bus  trips to Canada where we would take  mostly senior citizens to a Canadian  drugstore right across the river from  Detroit—Windsor—which was about a  3- or  4-hour bus drive  from Lorain  County, where I lived. We would take a  busload of 40 seniors and others—mostly seniors, as I said. We would buy prescription drugs in Canada—same dosage, same package, same drug manufacturer, for half or even sometimes a  third the cost because the Canadian  Government directly negotiated on behalf of  30 million Canadians, negotiated directly with the drug company  for specifically less expensive drugs. It  was clear to me then that reimportation was legislation we needed so seniors did not have to go to Canada; instead,  that  wholesalers,  the  Drug  Marts and the CVS’s of the world and  the mom-and-pop drugstores can negotiate, could get those prices wholesale  from Canadian drugmakers or companies and bring  those prices  significantly down for American consumers.  As Senator COBURN said, when we  were House Members we passed legislation 8 or 9 years ago. That legislation  was never  implemented  the way  it  should have been. The Dorgan amendment will save money for America’s  seniors, for America’s drug consumers,  for prescription drug users. It is an important amendment, and I ask for support for the Stabenow amendment, the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:59 May 03, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A02MY6.013 S02MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007

1082,165,2007-05-02,Mr. KENNEDY.," Madam President, I  wish to  join with Senator ENZI and  thank our friend and colleague, Senator DURBIN, for his strong leadership  on this issue. This is an issue of enormous importance to families across the  country.  As Senator ENZIjust mentioned, over  a year ago we made a strong commitment to the Senate that we were going  to work on this drug safety issue, and  we have come here in a bipartisan way  to put forward a very strong bill that  will ensure greater safety for American  families  in  the area of prescription  drugs. I think we are here to say that  we will join with our friend and colleague from Illinois to build on what is  an enormously important amendment  and commitment to ensuring that we  are going to have food safety as well as  pet food safety in this country.  I think this amendment, as has been  outlined by Senator DURBINand Senator ENZI, reaches the heart of the  challenges we face. One is on the issue  of surveillance. We understand that is  an essential aspect, whether it is food  safety or prescription drugs, or whether it is in the area of avian flu, bioterrorism—whatever the challenge that is  out  there,  surveillance  is  the  first  thing that needs to be done. We know  that today the system is grossly inadequate.  Second, we know  the  information  about food and food safety is scattered  through  a number  of  agencies  and  through a number of different kinds of  delivery systems, and that the coordination between the Federal and State  is  loose.  In all of these areas, this  amendment addresses these issues and  questions in a very effective way, to  bring common sense to and put real  teeth into the safety provisions.  The pet food standards that are in  this legislation are strong and effective  and would be very much appreciated by  all Americans who are concerned about  this issue. The standards are variable  at the present time. The reporting is  not good today, and this particular  amendment is particularly responsive  to that kind of challenge.  Finally, this addresses the central  concern all of us have read about and  are concerned about, which the Senator has spoken to, and that is the  issue of importation. When you add up  all of those kinds of elements, we find  this  is a very solid and meaningful  amendment. I think it strengthens the  legislation immensely. We have every  purpose, as we move forward, to find  ways we can provide even a greater  kind of protection and safety to the  food supply for American families.  I commend the Senator from Illinois.  I think we will be ready to have a vote  on this at the earliest time.  ",2007

So I give the assurance we are  going to address that issue in a timely  way. That will ultimately be part of  this legislation.  We also will be able to report on  progress we have made on several other  amendments. There are a  few  items  that are going to necessitate our attention through the evening. We had a  very good debate earlier today on the  children’s provisions; we had an important vote and discussion on that.  This addition this afternoon is enormously  important, and  I  think  the  time  that has been  taken  to work  through this legislation has made it  even stronger and better than I think  it otherwise might have been. I am  grateful to all of our colleagues who  are working with us on both sides of  the aisle, and particularly the staffs.  We are moving forward. We are going  to be busy this evening trying to work  through some of the items, and we will  have the cloture vote tomorrow and  the follow-on Cochran amendment.  There is a glimmer in sight about  reaching a conclusion to this legislation. Again, we are very appreciative of  all who have helped us up to this point.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  ",2007

I was happy to cosponsor this amendment, and I agree  with all of the sentiments expressed by  the Senator earlier today.  This amendment deals with many of  the underlying problems  that allow  food safety issues, such as the ones we  have dealt with in recent months that  have affected not only humans, but  their pets as well.  It requires the FDA to set standards  for pet food and to update them as necessary, and it directs the Secretary of  Health and Human Services to establish a system capable of detecting pet  food contamination and outbreaks of  pet illnesses and death—this will prevent the type of confusion that continues  to  surround  the  recent melamine outbreak, and will help detect  these problems much earlier.  It  requires FDA to develop effective communication plans to coordinate with  stakeholders during outbreaks of both  pet and human foods, so people know  what is going on—quickly—and know  what to do. It directs the Secretary to  work with States to collaborate on activities and programs that assist in improving the safety of raw agricultural  products such as spinach, which was  the cause of a major food safety recall  last fall.

1102,172,2007-05-02,Mr. GREGG.," Madam President, I understand that I may go forward. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator  from Massachusetts.  AMENDMENTNO. 993  (Purpose: To provide for the regulation of  Internet pharmacies)  Madam President,  today we have  been discussing, at some depth, and appropriately so, how to protect American citizens who purchase drugs overseas—from  overseas  pharmacies  or  from  Canadian  pharmacies—or  purchase drugs on the Internet. This is a  very significant issue for Americans,  especially as more and more Americans  use the Internet for the purposes of  buying all sorts of  items,  including  pharmaceuticals.  So we need to be sure this extraordinary regime we have set up in this  country stays intact that allows a person, when he or she goes into an American drugstore or goes into an American  supermarket,  to be  fairly confident the product they buy is not adulterated and the product they buy is  what it says it is and that in the instance of a pharmaceutical or a medication, it is going to be what the doctor told them to take. That has been  one of the great successes of American  Government. It  is because the Food  and Drug Administration is overseeing  this effort to protect the food supply  and the pharmaceutical supply.  Whether the Food and Drug Administration has the wherewithal, the legal  ability, and the technical and physical  ability to protect an American who  buys an overseas product, a medicine,  and imports it into the United States  is very much an issue. The FDA is very  concerned about their capacity to police effectively drugs coming into this  country, especially over the Internet.  So I have an amendment to this bill  which basically  is the Safe Internet  Pharmaceutical Act,  the purpose of  which is to give the FDA the authority  necessary to protect people who are  buying pharmaceutical products over  the Internet. This is, in my opinion,  very important.  The importance of this has only been  further stressed and exemplified by a  warning that came out today, fortuitously, from the FDA on the issue of  Internet pharmacies. I want to read extensively from this warning because it  goes to the essence of the debate we  have heard on  the  floor, especially  from Senators supporting the proposal  from the Senator from North Dakota  relative to reimportation and safety  and their representation that it is safe  to buy over the Internet and that their  amendment will make it legal to buy  drugs from outside the United States  over  the  Internet  through  their  reimportation language.  This warning from the FDA states as  follows: ‘‘FDA Warns Consumers about  Counterfeit Drugs from Multiple Internet Sellers.’’ I am going to read quite a  bit of the text because I think, first, it  is so on point and it is so important:  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  is cautioning U.S. consumers about dangers  associated with buying prescription drugs  over the internet. This alert is being issued  based on  information the agency received  showing that 24 apparently related Web sites  may be involved in the distribution of counterfeit prescription drugs.  On three occasions during recent months,  FDA received information that counterfeit  versions of—  I may not get all these medical terms  correct, but I hope I do.  On three occasions during recent months,  FDA received information that counterfeit  versions of Xenical 120 mg capsules, a drug  manufactured  by Hoffmann-LaRoche  Inc.  (Roche), were obtained by three consumers  from two different Web sites. Xenical is an  FDA-approved drug used to help obese individuals who meet certain weight and height  requirements  lose weight  and maintain  weight loss.  None of the capsules ordered off the Web  sites contained orlistat, the active  ingredient in authentic Xenical. In fact, laboratory analysis conducted by Roche and submitted to the FDA confirmed that one capsule contained sibutramine, which is the active ingredient in Meridia, an FDA-approved  prescription drug manufactured by Abbott  Laboratories.  While this product is also used to help people lose weight and maintain that loss, it  should not be used in certain patient populations and therefore is not a substitute for  other weight loss products. In addition the  drug interactions profile is different between  Xenical and sibutramine, as is the dosing frequency; sibutramine  is administered once  daily while Xenical is dosed three times a  day.  Other samples of drug product obtained  from two of the Internet orders were composed of only talc and starch. According to  Roche, these two samples displayed a valid  Roche lot number of B2306 and were labeled  with an expiration date of April 2007. The  correct expiration date for this lot number is  actually March 2005.  Pictures of the counterfeit Xenical  capsules can be seen on the Web site at  FDA. I would note they look exactly  like the Xenical that is legitimate. We  had a Senator here earlier holding up  two prescription bottles of, I think it  was Lipitor, saying: These two bottles  are exactly the same, and one could be  bought in Canada for about a third of  what  it costs  in the United States.  Well, you can buy this Xenical over the  Internet for probably about a third of  what it costs in the United States. The  only problem is it might kill you. I am  going to read further:  Roche identified the two Web sites  involved  in  this  incident  as  brandpills.com  and  pillspharm.com.  Further  investigation  by FDA  disclosed that these Web sites are two of  24 Web  sites  that  appear  on  the  pharmacycall365.com home page under  the ‘‘Our Websites’’ heading. Four of  these Web sites previously have been  identified by FDA’s Office of Criminal  Investigations as being associated with  the distribution of counterfeit Tamiflu  and counterfeit Cialis.  At this point, it appears that these  Web sites are operated from outside of  the United States. Consumers should  be wary, if there is no way to contact  the Web site pharmacy by phone, if  prices are dramatically lower than the  competition, or if no prescription from  your doctor is required. As a result,  FDA  strongly  cautions  consumers  about purchasing drugs  from any of  these Web sites which may be involved  in the distribution of counterfeit drugs  and reiterates previous public warnings  about buying prescription drugs online.  Then it lists the 24 Web sites, and  some  of  them have  very  seductive  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:31 May 03, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A02MY6.018 S02MYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 4 7 C P D O R P n o n a m l e o c c         ",2007
1103,186,2007-05-02,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President,  I have  sought recognition to comment on legislation I am introducing that will continue a positive trend in the provision  of  benefits  to  severely  injured  servicemembers and their families by  making assistance available when it is  needed most. My bill would give active  duty servicemembers who utilize VA’s  specially adapted housing grant assistance with the ability to also purchase  Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance, or  VMLI, through VA. Under current law,  the receipt of specially adapted housing grants is the gateway to VMLI eligibility. And only those separated from  service and legally classified as ‘‘veterans’’ are able to purchase coverage  through VMLI.  Servicemembers and veterans who  are blind, have lost the use of both  their legs, and who have other severely  disabling conditions are eligible to receive up to $50,000 in grants from VA to  assist with needed housing  adaptations, such as the widening of doorways, the construction of wheelchair  ramps, and the installment of handrails. Notwithstanding this grant assistance, servicemembers and veterans  must still pay any underlying mortgage that exists on the modified home.  To ensure that survivors are not saddled with mortgage debt they cannot  afford following the death of a severely  disabled veteran, VA’s VMLI program  is available. Under VMLI, up to $90,000  of coverage, or coverage in the amount  of  any  outstanding mortgage  debt,  whichever is less, is available. Veterans  pay premiums at standard mortality  rates and VA contributes subsidy payments so that all program expenses are  met.  Until recently, grants under the specially adapted housing program could  only be made to individuals who had  separated from military service. In recognition of what can be an extremely  lengthy recovery and separation process for those with profoundly disabling  conditions, in 2004 we in Congress allowed housing grants to be made to active duty servicemembers. However, we  did not extend the same access to VA’s  VMLI program for those still on active  duty, an oversight that my legislation  would remedy.  VA  estimates  that  roughly  30  servicemembers per year will receive  specially adapted housing grants, thus  giving rise to VMLI eligibility should  my bill be enacted. Because it is optional,  VA  expects  only  15  servicemembers per year to purchase  VMLI policies. Therefore, subsidy costs  associated with my  legislation  are  minimal,  less  than  $500,000 over  10  years.  This Congress increasingly is recognizing that the benefits provided to our  wounded servicemembers need to flow  immediately, and that outmoded distinctions between ‘‘veteran’’ and ‘‘active duty servicemember’’ mean little  when it comes to honoring our commitment  to  them. My  legislation  continues what I believe is an encouraging  trend that looks at the career of a military man or woman as a continuum. It  is a continuum that begins the day  they enlist and it ends the day they  die. Our Government’s benefits should  reflect that reality.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 1265  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

Nicole was known to many as a person who  possessed the heart of a servant. She found  ways to invest in those around her, whether it  was through conversation, friendship, lending  a helping hand, or through volunteer work. As  a trained emergency medical technician, she  is believed to have even been helping people  in the final moments of her life. Those who  were close to her know how passionately Nicole gave back to her community, classmates,  teachers, and  family. She was a committed  member of her church’s outreach program, a  Sunday school teacher, an EMT for the Smithfield Volunteer Fire and Rescue Squad, and a  lifeguard at her local YMCA.  Many say that one of Nicole’s greatest loves  in life was taking care of animals. During high  school, Nicole volunteered at local stables and  barns to take care of horses. In this hobby, it  is clear to see that Nicole’s heart and mission  in life was to serve and care for others. Nicole  was a double-major in International Relations  and German at Virginia Tech.  Nicole was a person who loved life, loved  serving people,  loved her  family, and, most  importantly, loved the Lord. Although her life  was tragically cut short, many are blessed to  have known and loved her.  f  RECOGNIZING THE FIRST MAJORITY WOMEN  CITY  COUNCIL  IN  KANSAS  CITY, MISSOURI  HISTORY  HON.

The women that stand before the City Clerk  today and take the oath of office as members  of the first majority women City Council are:  Deb Hermann—serving  the  1st District-at-  Large, Melba Curls—serving the 3rd District-  at-Large, Sharon Sanders Brooks—serving the  3rd District, Beth Gottstein—serving  the 4th  District-at-Large, Jan Marcason—serving  the  4th District, Cindy Baker Circo—serving  the  5th District-at-Large, and Cathy Jolly—serving  the 6th District-at-Large.  Deb Hermann was first elected to the City  Council in March 2003 and was immediately  appointed Chairwoman of  the Neighborhood  and Housing Committee and member of the  Operations Committee. She brought with her  experience and leadership ability through active participation and  involvement  in nearly  thirty civic and community organizations since  1979. She was a member of  the Gracemor  Randolph Community Council  for 24 years  and served as  its President  from 1994 until  her election to the City Council. Councilwoman  Hermann served as the Chairwoman for the  Property Maintenance Advisory Committee in  2001, and in 1999 was appointed as a Kansas  City Plan Commission Board Member. Councilwoman Hermann has proudly served  the  citizens of the 1st District-at-Large for the past  four years and continues to place a high priority on her commitment to neighborhoods.  Melba J. Curls has served the 41st District  in  the Missouri House of Representatives  since 1999, ending her service in 2006 to run  for City Council. While  in office, she championed many causes, the most notable being  legislation  that extended renewal of  the KC  Area Transportation Authority’s taxing ability to  ensure that the critical needs for public transportation  services  remained  funded  in our  community. This helped the less fortunate with  their need for public access to jobs and health  care. Curls has a long history of public service. Prior to her State election, she was employed in the Mayor’s Office with the City of  Kansas City, and before that, she served as a  staff assistant in the Kansas City office of U.S.  Senator Tom Eagleton. Curls  is a  life-long  resident of Kansas City, and attended the University of Missouri-Columbia.  Sanders Brooks has served the 37th District  in  the Missouri House of Representatives  since 2000, ending her service in 2006 to run  for City Council. While in the State Legislature,  she championed many causes, the most notable being a bill  that outlived mandatory set-  asides  for Minority and Women-owned businesses. She has long been committed to protecting our community’s history and brings that  passion to fight for the causes of her constituents with her to City Hall. Prior to her State  election, Brooks was successful civil rights investigator. A long-time friend and parishioner  of mine, Brooks  is a graduate of American  University  in Washington, DC where  she  earned a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism.  Beth Gottstein formerly served as the Resource Development Manager at the Hispanic  Economic Development Corporation  before  stepping  down  to  run  for  City  Council.  Gottstein has also been known to spearhead  several  local candidate campaigns and has  long been active in our region’s political organizations, including assisting with my first election to Congress. Gottstein has prior City Hall  experience and has also been  intimately  involved with the Greater Kansas City Women’s  Political Caucus, a local organization that promotes  women’s  involvement  in  politics.  Gottstein earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political  Science from the University of Missouri and a  Master’s of Public Administration from University of Missouri-Kansas City.  For the past sixteen years, Jan Marcason  has served as the Executive Director of the  Mid-America Assistance Coalition, where she  managed an annual budget of more  than a  million dollars and helped direct millions of  dollars  to  local social service organizations.  She was also  the  former President of  the  Women’s Political Caucus. Previously, Jan’s  public service extended  to Washington, DC,  where she worked for former Vice President  Walter Mondale. Marcason was born and  raised in Kansas City. She earned a Bachelor  of Arts  in Education  from  the University of  Kansas, and a Master’s in Business Administration  from University  of Missouri-Kansas  City.

1127,221,2007-05-02,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to celebrate the 100th birthday of  Oliver White Hill, who dedicated his life and  legal talents to making the City of Richmond,  the Commonwealth of Virginia, and this entire  country a place of promise and opportunity for  all. Mr. Hill used his legal talents to bravely  confront and help eradicate decades of racial  inequality and injustice.  Oliver White Hill was born Oliver White in  Richmond, Virginia. After his mother  remarried, the Hill family moved to Washington, DC,  where Oliver White Hill graduated  from  the  legendary Dunbar High School. Mr. Hill went  on  to earn his undergraduate degree  from  Howard University, and then attended Howard  University’s Law School, where, as destiny  would have  it, he was a classmate, rival  in  academic achievement, and close  friend of  Thurgood Marshall. Upon graduating in 1933,  second in his class only to the future Supreme  Court Justice, Mr. Hill spent his early years as  a civil rights attorney in Richmond, Virginia.  It was there that Mr. Hill grudgingly worked  within the confines of the separate-but-equal  framework of Plessy  v. Ferguson, but he  fought hard for better pay, full access to transportation, and better educational facilities for  African American  teachers and students.  In  fact,  in 1940, working with civil  rights  legal  stalwarts  Thurgood  Marshall, William  H.  Hastie, and Leon A. Ranson, Mr. Hill won his  first of many  landmark cases  in Alston v.  School Board of Norfolk, Va.  In Alston,  the  Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered equal  pay for black and white teachers within Norfolk’s school system. Despite the decision, Mr.  Hill was not completely satisfied as race barriers remained, and, as he once said, ‘‘I went  to law school so I could go out and fight segregation.’’  That fight would have to wait. Oliver White  Hill  joined  the Army  in 1943 and admirably  served his country in the European Theatre in  World War II. After a distinguished military career, Mr. Hill immediately began to fight for democracy on a different  front—back  in  the  courts against racial discrimination.  Soon after his return, Oliver White Hill won  the  right  for equal  transportation  for Black  school children in the Virginia Supreme Court.  But once again, he was not satisfied with this  ‘‘separate-but-equal’’ victory. The course of  history was about to change, however, as Mr.  Hill partnered with another civil  rights  legal  legend, Spottswood Robinson III, in 1948.  Together, Mr. Hill and Mr. Robinson brought  dozens of civil rights lawsuits against school  districts throughout the State of Virginia, with  as many as seventy-five (75) cases pending at  one time. By some estimates, Mr. Hill and Mr.  Robinson brought more lawsuits than the total  filed  in all  the other Southern States during  this era.  Despite the burning of a cross in his front  yard and despite almost daily threatening telephone calls to his home, Mr. Hill persevered.  In 1951, undeterred and emboldened, Oliver  White Hill and Spottswood Robinson decided  to move beyond ‘‘separate-but-equal’’ and attack segregation head-on.  That year, Mr. Hill and Mr. Robinson shouldered the cause of the African American students at the all-black R.R. Morton High School  in Farmville, VA, who had walked out of their  leaking, poorly heated classroom building. The  resulting  desegregation  lawsuit,  Davis  v.  County School Board of Prince Edward County, was one of several cases decided collectively as Brown v. Board of Education by the  U.S. Supreme Court in 1954.  While Oliver White Hill is best known as the  fierce, tireless civil rights litigator who helped  bring to a close America’s segregation-era, his  involvement  in  the community went beyond  the courtroom. In 1949, he became the first  African American elected to the Richmond City  Council  since Reconstruction.  In  the early  1960s, Mr. Hill served as Federal Housing  Commissioner in the Department of Housing  and Urban Development.  In addition  to his  local and Federal government posts, Mr. Hill  served as an officer or member on the boards  of many organizations, including the National  Legal Committee of the NAACP, the National  Bar Association, the Southern Conference for  Human Welfare, the Virginia State Bar Bench/  Bar Relations Committee, and the Old Dominion Bar Association, which he co-founded.  For his decades of dedication to the law and  accomplishments in the field of civil rights, Oliver White Hill has earned many accolades, including the ‘‘Lawyer of the Year Award’’ from  the National Bar Association  in 1959,  the  ‘‘Simple  Justice Award’’  from  the NAACP  Legal Defense Fund in 1986, and the ‘‘Justice  Thurgood Marshall Award’’ from the American  Bar Association  in 1993.  In 1999, President  Clinton awarded Mr. Hill the highest honor the  nation can bestow, the Presidential Medal of  Freedom. A year  later Mr. Hill received  the  American Bar Association Medal, the National  Bar Association ‘‘Hero of Law Award,’’ and the  ‘‘Harvard Medal of Freedom’’ for his role in the  landmark Brown decision. Most  recently,  in  2005, Mr. Hill was awarded  the NAACP’s  highest honor, the Springarn Medal.  In 2000, several legal admirers founded the  Oliver White Hill Foundation. The Foundation  encourages young lawyers to become advocates in the field of individual rights and liberties and  to carry on Mr. Hill’s civil  rights  work. Lawyers  inspired by  the Foundation  work with the hope that discrimination based  on race, gender, national origin, sexual preference, and  religion will ultimately be abolished, just as Mr. Hill has spent his life hoping  for and working towards.  Madam, Speaker, I offer my congratulations  to Oliver White Hill and pay tribute to him for  being one of history’s most  important civil  rights legal pioneers.  f  CONGRATULATING MR.

1128,221,2007-05-02,Mr. BURGESS.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to congratulate Mr. Bill Mullican of Lubbock, Texas on his recent appointment to the  National Advisory Council  for Environmental  Policy and Technology (NACEPT).  Mr. Mullican was appointed to the NACEPT  by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  Administrator, Stephen Johnson, on April 23,  2007. The Council is comprised of outside experts representing diverse interests from academia,  industry, non-governmental organizations, and state, local and tribal governments.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) established  the NACEPT  for  the purpose of providing expert advice  to  the EPA  Administrator on a wide array of environmental  policy,  technology, and management  issues.  Due to his vast knowledge of water development policies and  issues, Mr. Mullican will  prove to be a valuable asset to the NACEPT.

1129,228,2007-05-02,Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I  rise today in strong support for H. Res. 243.  The  imprisonment of political prisoners and  prisoners of conscience by  the Republic of  Vietnam  is unconscionable.  I  join my colleagues  in urging  the communist  regime  in  Hanoi to cease with these repressive actions.  Father Nguyen Van Ly and human rights attorneys Nguyen Van Dai and Le Thi Cong  Nhan were arrested earlier this year for allegedly disseminating propaganda against  their  government. Their actions were peaceful and  nonviolent, and are protected by  the Vietnamese Constitution.  In  the 12th  round of  human rights  talks between our government  and the government of the Republic of Vietnam  last week,  the assistant  to  the Vietnamese foreign minister attempted to highlight  their achievements  in  this arena, citing  the  protection and execution of basic rights and  freedoms of their people.  Madam Speaker,  these words  are  not  enough. We need action. The government of  Vietnam needs to show us their commitment  to providing basic human rights  to  their citizenry by releasing these Vietnamese patriots.  Their alleged crimes amount to nothing more  than advocating freedom of religion, speech,  movement  and  association;  these  actions  should be celebrated, rather than punished by  their government.  I support this resolution and call upon the  Socialist Republic of Vietnam to immediately  and unconditionally release these political and  religious prisoners. Further,  I call upon  their  government to embrace differing opinions, and  ensure their government’s vitality through the  strength  of  its  principles,  rather  than  the  strength of its police force.  f  A TRIBUTE TO JACK VALENTI  HON. HOWARD L. BERMAN  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 2, 2007  ",2007
1130,228,2007-05-02,Mr. BERMAN.," Madam Speaker, this week,  the Nation  lost one of  its most colorful and  wise counselors: Jack Valenti, who was  the  personification of the motion picture industry in  Washington. I can’t think of another industry  that has had a representative so well known  and so highly regarded, or one so accessible  in spite of his considerable fame. Much more  than ‘‘just’’ a lobbyist, Jack had an intense interest in public policy and a wisdom about him  that made him an extremely valuable counselor to Presidents, to Congressmen and Senators and to his peers and colleagues. He was  a great man with a charm and wit that won  him genuine affection as well as near universal admiration.  The following op-ed article from the Washington Post of Saturday, April 28 was written  by Matt Gerson, who worked with and was  mentored by Jack.  It describes perfectly  the  loss felt by those of us who were also fortunate enough to learn from this extraordinary  man.  WHATJACKVALENTITAUGHTUSALL  Jack Valenti lived a unique life between  two of society’s  fascinations—politics and  Hollywood. For Republicans and Democrats,  for senators and young aides, for celebrities  and the legions behind the cameras, interactions with him were graduate seminars in  history, politics, human nature and common  sense.  This  extraordinary  communicator  punctuated every conversation with a witticism linked to his beloved Texas, a quote  from an obscure historical figure or a rule  passed on to him by his mentor, Lyndon  Johnson. In the weeks  leading up to his  death Thursday, all over  town a  simple  ‘‘How’s Jack?’’ almost always led to, ‘‘You  know, I try to live by something I once heard  him say.’’  I first noticed his reach when a lunch companion said, ‘‘I try to return every phone call  the same day I receive it, and I try to treat  an appointment secretary like a Cabinet secretary.’’ That was followed by a senator who  revealed: ‘‘Jack was the first one to contact  me after my son died. I will never forget his  concern and support. How can I reach his  family?’’  For those Jack mentored during the 38  years he dedicated to America’s film industry, it became clear that character was defined by loyalty. In both Washington and  Hollywood, people often desert ‘‘friends’’ at  the first whiff of public disfavor. Not Jack—  time and again he insisted that you never  abandon a friend who was going through a  rough time, and he always stood with a beleaguered colleague or public official who  was receiving unwanted publicity.  He would tell his team to respect every  elected official (‘‘because you never even ran  for dog catcher, and they were sent here by  the people’’). He admonished us that your adversary today might be your ally tomorrow.  ‘‘In a political struggle, never get personal—  else the dagger digs too deep.’’  Jack rejected the partisanship that gripped  Washington and would warn that ‘‘nothing  lasts—today’s minority backbencher will be  tomorrow’s  subcommittee  chairman.’’ On  the day the Motion Picture Association of  America headquarters was named the Jack  Valenti Building, Senator TEDSTEVENSobserved, ‘‘Jack works across the aisle because  he doesn’t see an aisle. It is the root of his  success and what others ought to emulate.’’.  Each of the six studio chiefs who spoke at  the dedication ceremony emphasized that  Jack’s word was his bond—if he made a  promise, he never wavered. His rock-solid  commitment gave him unusual credibility  with leaders on both coasts and around the  world.  Jack was a gifted public speaker who put  incredible effort into making it all look effortless. He would rework his text behind  closed doors, reciting it until the cadence  was just right. Jack was ebullient when a  president complimented him once on the  ‘‘extemporaneous’’ remarks he had made at  the Gridiron Club. ‘‘The president couldn’t  believe I didn’t have a prepared text. I neglected to mention that I didn’t need notes  because I spent several days getting ready,’’  he said.  It was especially fun to watch Washington’s most accomplished professionals try to  decipher one of his homilies. They eventually got the point and often adopted the line  as their own. When a project was in trouble,  it was time to ‘‘hunker down like a mule in  a hailstorm.’’  [Modified  from the original  Texas vernacular for a family newspaper.]  When prospects got even worse, ‘‘The ox was  in the ditch.’’ But every problem could be addressed if you remembered ‘‘the three most  important words in the English language:  Wait a minute.’’  When someone from the MPAA left to take  a new job, Jack would say, ‘‘I like to think  I teach my people everything they know. But  I know I didn’t teach them everything I  know.’’ That  line always got a  laugh.  I  worked with Jack for 6 years and was friends  with him for nearly two decades. In the past  few years, frankly, I thought I had gleaned  every  lesson he had to offer. But then I  picked up the galleys of his soon-to-be-published memoir,  a  book  that  tracks  his  ‘‘Greatest Generation’’ fable. This grandson  of Sicilian  immigrants, decorated combat  pilot, Harvard MBA (‘‘thanks to the greatest  piece of social legislation ever devised by  man—the G.I. Bill’’), presidential adviser and  confidant of America’s business leaders has  left a treatise with even more rules to live  by.  One paragraph  is a must-read  for  the  BlackBerry-addicted. Jack quoted Emerson’s  observation that ‘‘for every gain, there is a  loss. For every loss, there is a gain.’’ While  lamenting the number of nights he spent  away from his family, he reminded us that  attending one more reception meant missing  a meal around the dinner table, and one  extra night on a business trip would mean  one less chance to help with homework or  watch a soccer game.  I have recounted that quote many times  over the past few weeks. And while this loss  is devastating for many in Washington and  Los Angeles, the life lessons that are his legacy are our gain.  f  SAN  JOSE  STATE  SESQUICENTENNIAL  SARY  UNIVERSITY  ANNIVERHON.

1131,228,2007-05-02,Mr. HONDA.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor San Jose State University on the occasion of its founding 150 years ago. For a  century and a half, San Jose State has provided affordable, quality education. From  its  humble beginnings as a normal school to train  teachers, San Jose State has grown  into a  comprehensive university, offering bachelor’s  and master’s degrees in 134 programs.  The University reflects the ethnic diversity of  California and particularly, that of Santa Clara  County with no single ethnic group comprising  a majority of  the student population. As a  graduate of San Jose State, I am particularly  proud to note that the University ranks tenth  among the Nation’s top public universities in  the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded to  minority students across all disciplines. Additionally, San Jose State University has conferred bachelor’s degrees  in business management and the health professions to more  Asian American and Pacific Islanders than any  other college or university in the Nation.  I would  like  to  thank my colleagues Representative  Representative  ANNAESHOO, Representative SAMFARR and  Representative JERRYMCNERNEY for  joining  LOFGREN,  ZOE VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:32 Jul 28, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\E02MY7.REC E02MY 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2007
1132,235,2007-05-02,Mr. ELLISON.," Madam Speaker,  it  is an  honor for me to speak in support of the Paul  Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity  Act of 2007. I want to thank both Congressman KENNEDYand Congressman RAMSTAD for  their dedication to ending insurance discrimination and ensuring all Americans have access to mental health and addiction services.  I also want to thank Speaker PELOSI, Majority  Leader HOYER, and Majority Whip CLYBURN for  their  leadership  in championing  this bill and  mental health access issues.  As a Minnesotan, I’m struck by the emotion  of  this day because  the  late Senator Wellstone’s tireless efforts to ensure mental health  parity might finally be realized. Paul Wellstone  knew it was wrong for health insurers to place  discriminatory  restrictions on  treatments and  I’m honored to be a part of this effort to finally  guarantee that the millions of Americans who  need mental health and addiction services can  obtain the treatment they deserve.  The urgent need  for  the Paul Wellstone  Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of  2007 is surely best expressed by those who  have seen a loved one in need denied coverage.  I  think  immediately of Kitty Westin,  whose daughter Anna suffered from anorexia,  a deadly disease that affects approximately 8  million  Americans  and  ultimately  claimed  Anna’s life. During her daughter’s battle with  anorexia, Kitty took Anna to the hospital. Anna  was refused care by their insurance company  because it did not consider access to mental  health treatment important enough to cover.  Kitty knows this is completely unacceptable  and has been fighting selflessly to make sure  no other family experiences the same frustration and pain. I commend her for carrying on  Anna’s legacy so impressively through her advocacy efforts and community work. For Kitty  and all of the others who have encountered insurance  discrimination,  I  carry Paul Wellstone’s message that mental health care is an  imperative part of all heath care. My hope is  that this bill in his name will finally pass, guaranteeing  that all Americans have access  to  mental health and addiction services.  f  TRIBUTE  TO  RYAN  JOHN  BURGESS, UNITED STATES MARINE,  LANCE CORPORAL  HON. DAVE CAMP  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 2, 2007  ",2007
1133,235,2007-05-02,Mr. CAMP of Michigan.," Madam Speaker,  the events of  the  last  few years have  reminded us that ‘‘eternal vigilance is the price  of liberty.’’ The United States stands as a beacon of hope and liberty for the world because  of the eternal vigilance of the men and women  who have  served and are  serving  in  the  United States military.  Marine Lance Corporal Ryan John Burgess  was one such soldier. A patriot through and  through, Ryan did not hesitate to answer the  call  to duty when his country went  to war.  Never an easy decision, and one that causes  great concern amongst parents, Ryan enlisted  and excelled as a marine. His leadership was  often recognized by his superiors in the form  of being granted additional responsibilities.  Today, I want to recognize on the floor of  the United States House of Representatives  the life and service of Ryan John Burgess—a  life given in full so that our freedom may be  preserved. Ryan’s bravery serves as a stark  reminder of  the  responsibility we have as  stewards of this great country—the land of the  free and the home of the brave.  So, as we salute heroes  like Ryan John  Burgess, we  remember  them with undying  gratitude. And we resolve, though we cannot  repay the debt we owe them, to live our lives  in such a way as to be worthy of their sacrifice.  May God keep Ryan; may God watch and  comfort his family; and, may God continue to  grant this Nation with the courage to defend  life and liberty.  HONORING THE CAREER OF  STEPHEN MCKENNEY STECK  HON. TOM FEENEY  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 2, 2007  ",2007
1134,235,2007-05-02,Mr. FEENEY.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor Mr. Stephen McKenney Steck for his  40 years of service to the WMFE public broadcasting stations that serve the greater Orlando  area.  An Orlando native, Steve began his only career in 1959 at WFTV (then WLOF) as a television director and later as senior producer/director for news and public affairs programs.  Steve started a 40-year  run at WMFE  in  1967 as production manager and was appointed operations manager in 1970. In 1972,  Steve was elected President of WMFE and  held that position with distinction for 34 years.  Steve’s major accomplishments during his  tenure include moving WMFE’s physical plant  to a multi-million dollar broadcast center  in  East Orlando,  the activation of public  radio  station 90.7 WMFE–FM, expanding both station’s programming to a full 24-hour per day  schedule,  overseeing  a  program  schedule  viewed each week by more than 485,000 Central Florida households and a radio schedule  listened to each week by more than 194,000  Central Florida residents.  Steve concluded a $4 million expansion of  the Public Broadcasting Center in 1992, a $2  million reexpansion in 2003, and a $10 million  Campaign  for Program Excellence  in 2002  generating  funds directed  to  local programming that connected the community in a manner not duplicated by local electronic media.  Steve recently concluded WMFE’s $7 million  Campaign for Digital Television that activated  WMFE–DT/Channel  23  in  2003. He  has  launched  the creation of a new $2.4 million  program vision for these stations. A transition  to digital radio broadcasting rests in the short-  term future. Under his leadership, WMFE’s annual budget has grown from $250,000 to more  than $8 million.  At age 63, Steve attained a 10-year goal:  starting in and finishing a marathon in all of  the 50 states and the District of Columbia and  on  all  7  continents—including  Antarctica!  Steve is married to Desta L. Homer, a former  teacher at Winter Springs High School  in  Seminole County. They have three adult children and five grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, in closing, I would like to  extend my heartfelt  thanks  to Steve  for his  years of service and dedication to his Orlando  community. I ask my colleagues to join me in  congratulating Mr. Steve on his retirement and  wishing him the best of luck in all future endeavors.  f  INTRODUCTION  OF  REPAIRING  YOUNG WOMEN’S LIVES AROUND  THE WORLD ACT  HON.

1136,1,2007-05-14,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise to call for an explanation and a  full accounting from the Department of  Defense concerning an attack on Camp  Falcon last year. This much is not in  dispute: Under cover of darkness on October 10, 2006, Camp Falcon, America’s  largest military base in Iraq, which is  10 miles south of Baghdad, was attacked by insurgents, and the base was  shelled with mortars and rockets. An  enemy round struck an ammunition  store which triggered massive explosions and huge fireballs that lit up the  night sky in Baghdad.  News footage and amateur video were  shown on television in the Middle East,  and a BBC reporter described the explosions as immense. In the days following  the attack, U.S. military officers  in  Iraq repeatedly said that the damage  would not degrade U.S. military capacity and that the attack did not injure  or kill anyone at the base.  In a briefing on October  12,  2006,  Major General William Caldwell told  reporters, ‘‘Very fortunately, no coalition forces or Iraqi security forces were  injured, nor civilian casualties  that  anyone is aware of at this point. We  lost some munitions, but took no personnel casualties.’’ That is the official  line for the military.  But the questions are beginning to  surface as to whether the official line  is the truth. It was brought to my attention yesterday during a meeting in  my congressional office with Mohammed al Deeni, an independent member  of the Iraqi Parliament. He came to the  U.S. to talk with Members of Congress  about the realities of life in Iraq. At  my invitation, other Members of Congress joined me in this face-to-face legislative exchange of information. They  heard what I am about to share.  During our meeting, I asked Mr. al  Deeni if Iraq was so unstable that a  terrorist attack could claim a  large  number of Americans in one attack. As  many of us remember, that  is what  happened in 1983 when a massive terrorist truck bomb struck and killed 241  U.S. Marines in Beirut. I wanted to  know if such an attack was possible in  Iraq. Without hesitation, Mr. al Deeni  said such an attack had already occurred. He said—and others are saying  online—that the attack on Camp Falcon killed 300 Americans, wounded another 200 Americans and killed or injured another 200 Iraqis.  The Pentagon says there were no casualties. But a member of the Iraqi Parliament and others claim there were  significant casualties. Which story is  true? Satellite  images, aerial photographs, videos and written accounts  that purport to be  firsthand can be  found online.  I will enter  into  the  RECORDa list of some of these sites so  that people can see for themselves.  Internet sites which contains video, photographs, or written accounts of the attack on  Camp Falcon on October 10, 2006:  http://www.cawa.fr/destruction-du-camp-  americain-falcon-explosions-d-armes-a-l-ua-  et-ou-d-armes-nucleaires-tactiques-  article00913.html.  http://www.dailymotion.com/related/966319/  video/xkpjv_base-falcon-irakexplosion-  nucleaire/1.  http://abutamam.blogspot.com/2006/10/no-  reported-casualties-at-camp-falcon.html.  http://zennobia.blogspot.com/2006/10/al-  rashid-falcon-military-bases.html.  Here is one excerpt from a site written after the attack by French journalists: ‘‘Nine big carriers marked by the  Red Cross sign transporting the dead  and injured were seen by journalists  . . . Silence still wraps the whole event  from the side of the American military  as well as the Bush administration,  since there remains only a few weeks  before the legislative elections, with a  public opinion more and more against  the war.’’  This happened  just before the  last  elections, and it is unclear as to what  happened. I don’t know if these stories  are credible. But these reports cannot  be ignored. If we lost hundreds of U.S.  soldiers and other Americans in one attack, Congress and the American people have a right to know about it.  I looked at the videos and the aerial  photographs, and the damage appears  quite extensive to buildings and military  vehicles  like  tanks.  Perhaps  American soldiers and others miraculously escaped injury. That would be  very good news. Or perhaps we don’t  know what  really happened on  the  night of October 10, 2006 in an insurgent attack on Camp Falcon.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

1137,8,2007-05-14,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the  House Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform, I am pleased to  join with my colleague  in consideration of H.R. 1617, which names a postal facility in University City, Missouri,  after Harriett F. Woods.  H.R. 1617, which was introduced by  Representative  on  March 21, 2007, was reported from the  Oversight Committee on May 1, 2007,  by a voice vote. This measure has been  cosponsored by 74 Members and has the  entire support of the Missouri delegation.  Ms. Harriett F. Woods was elected  from the 13th District of Missouri in  St. Louis County to the Missouri State  Senate in November of 1976. She was  reelected for a second term in November of 1980. She was the first woman to  win statewide offices in Missouri, becoming Lieutenant Governor in 1984.  She ran for the U.S. Senate twice in  the  1980s, and while both attempts  failed, it inspired other women to run  for and win political office. Ms. Woods  was an activist who promoted women  politicians. She served two terms as  President of the National Women’s Political Caucus and led the Clinton administration’s Coalition  for Women  Appointments in 1993.  Before becoming an elected official,  Ms. Woods was an  independent  film  producer and served 10 years as the  Public Affairs Director at KPLR–TV in  St. Louis. At KPLR,  she  produced  CARNAHAN RUSS many  noted  documentaries,  among  them the award-winning film on child  abuse, ‘‘Broken Children,’’ ‘‘Don’t Go  to Jail  in Missouri’’ and  ‘‘Piedmont  UFO.’’  Mr. Speaker,  I commend my colleague RUSSCARNAHAN for introducing  this legislation and urge its swift passage.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

Woods Post Office Building.’’ Harriet Woods will long be remembered as a pioneer in American politics.  Born in Cleveland, OH, Harriet Woods received a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy  from the University of Michigan. She married  Jim Woods on January 2, 1953. Before beginning her career in politics, Woods worked as  a journalist and television producer.  Woods’ political career began in 1962, when  she became a member of the University City  Council. In 1976, she was elected to the Missouri State Senate and was  re-elected  in  1980. Dedicated  to women’s participation  in  government, Woods was  the  first woman  to  win statewide office in Missouri when she was  elected Lieutenant Governor  in 1984. While  she was not successful  in  the  two Senate  races in which she was a candidate, her actions and  leadership  inspired hundreds of  women nationwide to participate in politics.  ",2007

White Post Office  Building.  Willye B. White was born to run. She  was a five-time Olympic track and field  athlete from Money, Mississippi. She  was the best female long jumper of the  time. She made Chicago her home in  1960 until her untimely death in February, 2007.  She wasn’t a household name, but  she should have been, especially if your  household happens to be one of the millions that includes a female athlete. Or  an athlete of color. Or a once or future  Olympian. She was better known for  her  actions  than her name,  better  known for her deeds than her medals.  At 16, she competed in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games and became the  first American woman to ever medal in  the long jump, earning a silver medal.  She participated in the next four Olympiads as well, and is the first American  to compete on five Olympic track and  field teams. She won another silver  medal in the 1964 Tokyo Games in the  4-by-100-meter relay. Ms. White competed in more than 150 nations as a  member of 39 different  international  track and field teams.  Over the years, White remained active  in the  field of sports. She represented track and field on the U.S.  Olympic Committee, coached athletes  in the National Sports Festival in 1979  and 1981, coached and managed at the  1981 World Cup Track and Field Championship Games in Brussels and Rome,  and served as the head coach for the  1994 Olympic Sports Festival.

1151,22,2007-05-14,Mr. ORTIZ.," Thank you, Charlie, for  allowing me some time to speak tonight, and I would like to acknowledge  your leadership in bringing this to the  forefront.  Mr. Speaker, as we continue the national discussion of immigration and  the value of immigrants to our Nation,  we must not forget the immigrant men  and women who populate our Armed  Forces, who fight for freedoms that we  all enjoy each day, yet who in the current debate are cast aside as unworthy  for citizenship. Yes, more than 70,000 of  them serve our military today.  Now,  they have a unique  love of  America. They consider this great Nation as a beacon of light that drew  them here, with a promise of freedom,  of democracy and opportunity.  The voices of these immigrant soldiers are remarkably missing from the  debate on the value of immigrants in  this Nation. I would like to add their  voices today. For them, the United  States is their only chance to make a  new life. Like all soldiers, they don’t  want our Nation to be harmed. This is  their brass ring, the key to the rest of  their lives.  They are willing to risk their life for  this country because it is the promise  of what working hard can give you.  They come to the United States longing for a better life than they had in  their homeland. Their  last  light of  hope resides in what this Nation promises in terms of honoring our soldiers  and supporting our troops.  Many have said that they would rather fight and die for the United States  because they so desperately want their  home countries to emulate, to copy,  their adopted Nation. They hope beyond hope that their public service in  our military will someday  influence  their  home  countries,  the  ones  in  which they were born, so their families  will someday have similar living conditions promised by this Nation and the  same economic opportunities.  They fear that if America’s beacon of  light is extinguished, the long-lasting  effect of that would inspire great fear,  in  this hemisphere and around  the  world.  One of the most heartbreaking exercises for me is going to military funerals, as it is for all of us. One of the  most heartbreaking moments is with a  family after losing a loved one and bestowing citizenship upon the lost soldier after he’s buried.  At this point, I would like my colleagues to join me in commending the  service  of Private First Class Rey  Cuervo, killed in Baghdad by an IED  just before New Year’s Eve in 2003. He  left behind a young wife, pregnant with  his first child, a child of immigrants  who will never see his father again,  who died for this Nation.  I still remember the moment I was  there for the ceremony granting Rey  his citizenship in 2004 after his death.  b2000  Tears in the eyes of all who attended  the funeral spoke volumes. Yes, so far  to the price of citizenship, now so close  to God, so that you and I and the rest  of the citizens of this great country  could enjoy the freedoms and privileges  and liberties that we have today.  ",2007
1152,22,2007-05-14,Mr. GONZALEZ.," I yield at this time  to my colleague  from Colorado, an  Army veteran himself. I do want to  point out, without his permission, but  knowing this particular fact, that the  Salazar family, I know that he lost his  uncle during World War II, and that  was incredible and brave service by the  Salazar  family,  Congressman  SALAZARof Colorado.  ",2007
1153,22,2007-05-14,Mr. SALAZAR.," I want to thank the  gentleman from Texas for yielding, Mr.  JOHN  GONZALEZ, and I want to thank your  leadership for bringing this very important issue to the forefront.  Tonight,  I would  like  to  tell  the  story of Christopher Herrera. Lance  Corporal Evenor Christopher Herrera  was just 9 years old when his family  came to the United States from Honduras  in  search of opportunity. He  found that opportunity for himself in  the United States serving in the Marine Corps, which he joined a year after  graduating from Gypsum’s Eagle Valley High School in Colorado.  He  figured that enlisting he could  pave the way to a better future, or, as  he  told his  family,  the  22 year-old  would be considered a hero if he should  die while serving his adopted country.  Fate chose him the latter. On August  10, 2005 while manning a machine gun  during a clash near Ar Ramadi in Iraq,  an  improvised explosive device detonated. Herrera was killed in combat  with a month and a half left before he  was to return home.  From  the  time his  family  immigrated from Honduras, he began talking about  joining  the Army. Christopher, as he was known to his family  and friends, was not naive about the  dangers he faced in Iraq. His brother,  who was also a Marine, said that Christopher was happy to fight for the country that he loved. He would rather die  over there as a hero and be remembered as doing something good, as opposed to being here and not remembered at all.  His mother, Blanca,  said  that he  joined because he wanted to have more  opportunity in this country. He wanted  a career in the Marines. The stories  about Christopher come easily. His sister recalled about how shy he was, but  yet he was fearless, and once drove a 4-  wheel-drive vehicle down a muddy hill,  nearly flipping it over. Christopher enjoyed typical mountain activities like  most young men in Colorado, like fishing and snowboarding.  The brothers often went camping.  The brothers were close, but because  they were both deployed Balmore Herrera  hadn’t  seen  his  brother  in  7  months. When Christopher was killed,  Balmore was called to act as official  military  transport  as  his  brother’s  body was transported from Maryland  to Colorado.  There have been 3,396 servicemembers killed  in Iraq and Afghanistan,  and over  25,000 Americans wounded.  This evening, members of the Hispanic  Caucus  rise  to  recognize  immigrant  servicemembers because  these brave  men and women didn’t have the privilege of being born  in this country.  They chose to live here, and also made  the choice to serve the country they  loved in the Armed Forces.  Many immigrants, like Christopher,  have paid the ultimate sacrifice  for  their country. Each of  them has a  story. Each story is filled with struggle  and a hope for opportunity. Like Christopher, each story is also filled with  sacrifice.

1175,64,2007-05-14,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I thank  the Senator for yielding.  I would  like  to make  some comments. First of all, we do not take this  out. We do not eliminate it. We just  say there ought to be a priority on the  funds, and the funds for housing ought  to come ahead of this. No. 2 is, 3 years  ago, a new visitor center was opened  for  this  very  purpose  for  the  Atchafalaya Basin, which is the focus  of the new visitor center. This  just  opened 3 years ago.  Again, in a quote from it: Smack dab  in the center of the Atchafalaya Basin  is a very welcoming site for those traveling on Interstate 10. The Atchafalaya  Welcome Center is open seven days a  week from 8:30 to 5. The center is located off Interstate 10 at exit 121. It is  a first class facility, quite impressive,  with historical information within the  walls. It is an Acadian-style cottage  museum. Outside, wildlife and nature  will take you back in time.  It was completed in June 2004. It has  many of the same things the Senator  wants to support. There are also two  other visitor centers in Morgan City,  so it is not that there is not some process out there already to do that.  Again, the point is not to eliminate  this visitor center. The point is to say,  shouldn’t we have a priority—before we  allow money to go for another visitor  center where there is already one that  has just opened 3 years ago, shouldn’t  we have the people who need housing  taken care of? So I will stand with that  and will not continue the debate on  that.  AMENDMENTNO. 1090TOAMENDMENTNO. 1065  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be  set aside and call up amendment No.  1090.  ",2007

1178,64,2007-05-14,The PRESIDING OFFICER.," Without  objection, it is so ordered.  The amendment is as follows:  (Purpose: To prioritize Federal spending to  ensure the residents of the city of Sacramento are protected from the threat of  floods before spending money to add sand  to beaches in San Diego)  On page 11, strike line 5 and insert the following:  (6) IMPERIALBEACH, CALIFORNIA.—  (A) INGENERAL.—Subject to subparagraph  (B), the  On page 11, between lines 15 and 16, insert  the following:  (B) REQUIREMENT.—No Federal funds shall  be used for beach nourishment for Imperial  Beach, California, until the date on which  the Secretary certifies to Congress that the  Sacramento River Bank Protection Project  has been completed.  ",2007
1179,64,2007-05-14,Mr. COBURN.," This, again, is for the  restoration of beaches. It is a 30- or 40-  year project, which I do not object to  on its face. I love beaches. I take my  family to Florida. I noticed recently  they  restored  beaches  down  there.  Again, the question is priorities. We  have a tough time setting priorities.  We take authorizations bills, we don’t  look at them. What we do is we get  them authorized and then we fight like  heck when  the  appropriations  time  comes around to get our projects funded.  The Sacramento  levee system, according to the Corps of Engineers, is  one of the most  important projects  they have in terms of reducing risk for  people at risk of flood. We had a debate  on this floor less than a year ago with  the Senators from California. I talked  to the Governor of California. I had attempted to strip out some of the funding of an emergency bill for emergency  funds for the Corps of Engineers for  this basin and for these levees. They  convinced me with their argument that  was a high priority. I actually withdrew my amendment. I did not ask for  a vote on it.  We have a WRDA bill that has this in  it, and then we have a beach restoration project, over which there is some  significant debate in terms of Imperial  Beach in southern California, restoring  that beach over the next 40 to 50 years,  with intermittent projects every 4 to 5  years, pumping  sand  to  restore  the  beach. I am not against that, either.  But what I think we have to do is set  a priority.  Why shouldn’t the priority be that  we protect the people of Sacramento  and finish the levee system? The answer will be: We can do both. Well, we  really cannot do both. We will do both  probably, but we cannot do both. We  cannot do both with the money we  have. So then it comes to: Where are  the priorities? We will have this debate  again when the bills come forward in  the appropriations process, of where  the priority is. We will probably fund  both  these  projects. But when  the  American taxpayers ask: Now, which  one is most important, which one is a  true Federal responsibility, which one  is  a State  responsibility,  they  are  going  to want  some answers. When  asked about protecting a major city  such as Sacramento with a levee system that the Corps of Engineers designed, which was substandard to begin  with, and redoing that to make sure we  protect all these people, or letting the  State of California  restore  its own  beaches  from sand erosion, I believe  the vast majority of Americans will  say: As to the beach, probably the local  community can afford to do that. They  get the benefits off of it. They get the  property taxes off of it. They get the  tourism off of it. But Sacramento is a  different  story.  It  is  something  the  Federal Government  started.  It  is  something the Federal Government is  responsible for, and something the Federal Government should respond to and  finish.

1180,85,2007-05-14,Mr. NELSON of Florida.," Mr. President, I have introduced a bill that will  honor one of Florida’s great jurists, the  Honorable C. Clyde Atkins, by naming  the Federal  building  at  301 North  Miami Avenue in Miami, FL, the ‘‘C.  Clyde Atkins United States Courthouse.’’ This  is a  fitting tribute to  Judge Atkins. His public service provides a model for members of the legal  profession, indeed, for all Americans,  who respect the rule of law and believe  in equal justice under law.  Before becoming a judge, Judge Atkins, who earned his law degree at the  University of Florida, already had distinguished himself in private practice.  He served as the president of both the  Florida bar and the Dade County Bar  Association. In 1966, President Johnson  appointed Judge Atkins to serve on the  U.S. District Court for the Southern  District of Florida. He served until his  death in 1999 at the age of 84. From 1977  until 1982, Judge Atkins was the chief  judge for the Southern District, and his  leadership ensured that the court remained effective through a period when  Miami confronted serious problems involving  refugees, violence, and drug  smuggling.  Judge Atkins rendered important decisions in the areas of civil rights and  civil liberties. By the luck of the draw,  he was assigned to many controversial  cases, earning him the nickname ‘‘Hard  Luck Clyde,’’ and it was for those rulings, often  involving  important civil  rights and civil liberties issues, that he  will be best remembered.  For example, in a decision involving  Miami’s homeless population, he ordered  the  creation  of  ‘‘safe  zones’’  where the homeless could congregate  without fear of arrest. This important  decision had a ripple effect, helping to  give rise to efforts throughout the Nation  to  rehabilitate  the  homeless  through training and the creation of  shelters. He also ruled in support of  Cuban and Haitian refugees who were  held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and  against the government’s repatriation  policy. And finally, he presided over  the desegregation of Dade County’s  public schools for more than 20 years.  Judge Atkins was a person of faith.  He was the first Catholic appointed to  the bench in the Southern District, and  Pope Benedict VI named him a Knight  of St. Gregory. Judge Atkins  also  earned recognition from the National  Conference of Christians and Jews, the  Anti-Defamation  League,  and  the  American Judicature Society, to name  a few.  The proposal to name the courthouse  in Miami after Judge Atkins has been  supported by leaders of the bar in the  Southern District, including the Dade  County Bar Association. Passage of my  bill will ensure that the C. Clyde Atkins Courthouse will stand as an enduring tribute to an admired and respected Federal  judge and the principles for which he stood for generations to come.  By Mr. REED:  S. 1386. A bill to amend the Housing  and Urban Development Act of 1968, to  provide better assistance to low- and  moderate-income  families,  and  for  other purposes; to the Committee on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.  ",2007
1181,85,2007-05-14,Mr. REED.," Mr. President, today I introduce the Homeownership Protection  and Enhancement Act of 2007, HOPE  Act. This legislation would reauthorize  and amend Section 106 of the Housing  and Urban Development Act of 1968, so  that we can improve on Federal efforts  to support and sustain homeownership.  As we all know, during the past several years, housing prices in cities and  States around the country have  far  outpaced any increase in wages. Families have been stretching themselves financially to get into homeownership,  and many families have started using  alternative or exotic mortgages loan  products to purchase their homes.  According to First American Loan  Performance, in 2006, in my own State  of Rhode Island, nearly 16 percent of all  home-purchase  loans were  ‘‘interest  only.’’ However, as home prices have  declined, many people who took out  these exotic loans are now finding they  owe more than the value of their property.  The Center for Responsible Lending  estimates that nationally one in five  subprime loans originated during the  prior 2 years will end in foreclosure,  costing homeowners $164 billion, mostly in lost equity.  ‘It appears that we are just at the beginning of what could be a perfect  storm, as many credit-stressed borrowers still face resets of these exotic  adjustable-rate  and  payment  option  loans. There were  1.2 million  foreclosures reported nationwide last year,  up 42 percent from 2005, according to  RealtyTrac, a database of  foreclosed  properties. RealtyTrac  also  reports  430,000 foreclosure filings in the first  quarter of 2007, a 35 percent jump over  the same period in 2006.  The  increasing rate of  foreclosures  across the country  is troubling. Not  only  are  individual  families  losing  their homes and their financial nest  eggs, but there is a negative ripple effect across communities and the economy. That is why I am introducing the  Homeownership Protection  and Enhancement Act, or HOPE Act.  This bill seeks to help States establish and enhance outreach programs to  proactively find homeowners at risk of  losing their homes and help them avoid  foreclosure. States will be rewarded for  having set up effective programs to  help  curtail  foreclosures with additional funding and resources. An incentive is provided for more States to follow suit and reach out to delinquent  borrowers, offer them access to financial counseling, and, when appropriate,  help them negotiate a plan to restructure their debt.  In particular, the HOPE Act provides  $50 million for the creation and operation of State Homeownership Protection Centers. The centers can serve as  a one-stop resource, offering consumers  a broad range of services and assistance, such as  financial assessments,  counseling, or referrals to families in  need. It authorizes $260 million in competitive grants to States who operate  State Homeownership Protection Centers for revolving loan funds to offer  one-time grants or subsidized loans to  qualified families. It increases funding  to $300 million for effective HUD-approved counseling agencies. Finally, it  sets aside $5 million for the creation of  a Federal database on defaults and  foreclosures to  improve oversight of  public and private efforts to sustain  homeownership.  In addition, to help prevent future  borrowers  from  taking  on  unsustainable mortgages and  falling  into foreclosure, the HOPE Act would  create an affirmative duty for lenders  and servicers to engage in reasonable  loss mitigation prior to foreclosure. It  would  also  require notifications  by  lenders and servicers to borrowers regarding the  full array of counseling  services available  in  their State at  every critical step, at application, at  closing, and upon delinquency. Finally,  if a State has a State Homeownership  Protection  Center,  lenders  and  servicers would be required to refer  borrowers who are 60 days or more delinquent to the center so that it can  proactively attempt to reach distressed  borrowers.  I am introducing the HOPE Act because when homes get foreclosed on, it  is not just the borrowers and lenders  who pay  the price, whole neighborhoods suffer. Housing industry experts  estimate  that  for  every  foreclosure  within an eighth of a mile of a house,  two and a half city blocks in every direction,  the property value of  surrounding homes drops by about 1 percent. I believe that the Federal Government has a responsibility to step in  and ensure that millions of Americans,  including neighbors who never  took  out a risky loan and have scrimped and  saved to pay their bills on time, are  not adversely affected by the subprime  foreclosure crisis.  This  legislation  is  targeted  relief  that will help more families keep their  homes and save communities nationwide millions of dollars. We need to act  swiftly before personal financial tragedies turn into a full blown national financial crisis.  The HOPE Act will set us on the path  to meeting an important national goal,  creating sustainable homeownership. I  hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill and other foreclosure  prevention efforts.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.

1182,99,2007-05-14,Ms. MCCOLLUM of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  to support  the Student Loan Sunshine Act, and to congratulate Chairman MILLERand Ranking Member MCKEON for moving  quickly on this critical issue.  The recent investigation by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has brought attention to serious problems in our student aid  industry. While it is unfair to malign all schools  and all lenders, it is clear that in large part due  to  lax oversight by  the Department of Education, there have been many instances of actions  intended  for profit—rather  than  for  improving student access to education. It is time  to put an end to the conflicts of interest and  corrupt practices that increase costs for students and taxpayers.  This legislation is an important first step in  improving oversight of the student loan industry and  in ending  inappropriate relationships  between lenders and colleges and universities.  H.R. 890 will ban loan arrangements that include benefits to higher education institutions,  prohibit lenders from serving as staff in campus  financial aid offices, and ban gifts  from  lenders to campus officials and their families.  It allows the continuation of preferred lender  lists but  requires  that  these  lists  include at  least 3 lenders and that the institutions explain  their choices. This bill includes civil penalties  for companies that violate the new regulations  and increases the Department of Education’s  authority to regulate the private loan market.  The Student Loan Sunshine Act also makes it  clear that lenders who are transparent in their  processes and advocate on behalf of students  continue to be an important part of the student  aid system.  Mr. Speaker, the recent scandals in the student loan industry illustrate the Department of  Education’s failure to adequately regulate the  student loan industry and the conflicts of interest too often noted in this administration. As  the New York Times reported, Department officials were alerted  to  inappropriate  lender  subsidies in 2003 and failed to act. This week  a top ED official, who formerly worked for Sallie Mae, has resigned. It has also been noted  that a recently investigated lender was a top  contributor to the Republican party. It is time  to  refocus higher education policy where  it  should be—on the student.  This Congress has made access to higher  education a priority. It is critical to the future  of students, our communities and our Nation.  With more and more students and parents relying on student loans and with student debt  burden increasing, clearly we must do all we  can to ensure the integrity of student aid programs. The Student Loan Sunshine Act is an  important  first step.  I also  look  forward  to  working with Chairman MILLERand the other  members of  the Education and Labor Committee to pass a strong Higher Education Act  Reauthorization  that  protects  students,  increases access to higher education, and improves our Nation’s global competitiveness.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in supporting H.R. 890.  f  RECOGNIZING THE DEDICATION OF  DOCTOR SUSAN A. COTA  HON. ELLEN O.

She has also served as the Statewide  Administrator of Disabled Students Programs  and Services.  Dr. Cota holds a doctorate in organization  and  leadership  from  the University of San  Francisco, a Master of Science degree in Vocational Rehabilitation Counseling  from San  Francisco State University and a bachelor’s  degree in English from Immaculate Heart College.  Dr. Cota is active in a wide variety of national, state, and local organizations. She was  elected to the Board of the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), and currently serves on the Executive Board and as  Chair of the Community College Futures Committee and on  the Board of  the Community  College  Leadership Development  Initiatives  Foundation at the University of San Diego.  In 2006, she  received  the Harry Buttimer  Distinguished Administrator Award  from  the  Community College Administrators. She has  also received the Community College League  of California’s Courageous Leader Award, and  the Outstanding Educator  in Administration  Award.

MIKE THOMPSON  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 14, 2007  ",2007
1184,99,2007-05-14,Mr.  THOMPSON  of  California.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today to recognize Acme Rigging & Supply Company in Ukiah, California,  on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. Acme  has been locally owned and operated for the  past 50 years, and for the last 18 years has  transitioned  into a wholly employee-owned  business while continuing to expand its operations and the markets it serves.  Acme Rigging started out in 1957 as the vision of Pete Dunnebeck, when  five  rigging  shops went out of business on the northern  California  coast.  Initially, as  the  sole employee, he took orders, performed the assembly, and  then delivered  the  final product  to  customers.  Thirty-two  years  later  Mr.  Dunnebeck was getting ready to phase out of  the business when he  learned about Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP).  In 1989, Mr. Dunnebeck sold forty-nine percent of  the business  to his employees. By  1997,  the employees had  fulfilled  the payoff  on their shares and approached the Savings  Bank of Mendocino County to borrow money  to purchase  the remaining 51 percent. This  was the first loan of its kind for the local bank,  and they put the deal together and agreed on  a ten-year payback. The employees met that  obligation in nine years, one year earlier than  expected.  Upon  the  retirement of Mr. Dunnebeck,  John Peaslee took the reins of the company  and has guided an impressive expansion. In  1997, Acme Rigging had less than three million dollars in sales. By 2006 that number had  tripled. The company grew from eight employees to a total of 29 today. A second location  was opened  in Sacramento  in 2000. Acme  Sacramento started with four employees and  now has 10.  Madam Speaker and colleagues, there are  more than 10,000 ESOP companies employing nine to ten million employee/owners in our  country. Acme Rigging & Supply Company is  a superb example of how well employee stock  ownership plans can work.  It  is appropriate  that we honor  the successful  transformation  and expansion of this local, employee-owned  business on the occasion of its 50th anniversary.  ∑ This ‘‘bullet’’ symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

1186,106,2007-05-14,Ms. ZOE LOFGREN of California.," Madam  Speaker, I rise because May 11 is Vietnamese  Human Rights Day, and my conscience will  not  let me stay quiet on  this very  troubling  issue. I also rise today to applaud the efforts  of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom on their recent report on the  status of religious freedom in the world.  I am deeply troubled by the findings of the  Commission, but I can’t say that I’m surprised.  The  Commission  made  the  same  recommendation  last year: Vietnam should be  placed on the State Department’s list of Countries of Particular Concern because of government repression  towards many religious believers.  The Vietnamese government’s campaign to  force people to renounce their faith, their detainment of dozens of religious prisoners, and  the harassment and physical mistreatment of  some believers and their families amounts to  inexcusable human rights violations.  In Vietnam’s quest to gain Permanent Normal Trade Relations with  the United States,  and access to the WTO, the Vietnamese embarked on a disingenuous public  relations  campaign  to cleanse  its  image as a human  rights violator.  Secretary Rice caved in to the campaign of  their  communist  government  and  removed  Vietnam from the Countries of Particular Concern list.  But some of us in Congress were not fooled  by this advertising campaign.  My constituent, Cong Thanh Do, a United  States citizen, was unjustly arrested  in Vietnam last August while on a family vacation.  Mr. Do is no criminal. He is nothing more than  a peaceful democracy and human rights activist who wrote articles that he then posted on  the internet while he was living in the United  States.  Vietnam held Cong Thanh Do  imprisoned  for over a month before he was released after  we pressured the Vietnamese government.  Because of  the evidence suggesting  that  Vietnam made  little  progress  on  human  rights—especially given  the detention of my  constituent, Cong Thanh Do—I told the administration it would be a mistake to grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations with Vietnam  and I voted against it.  Three of Mr. Do’s supporters  in Vietnam  were tried and sentenced yesterday for 3 to 5  years of prison each. Their crime? Promoting  a multi-party democratic system  in Vietnam  through peaceful means and sending email  communication to my constituent.  After Vietnam joined the WTO, I think it is  obvious  that  the conditions of religious  freedom in Vietnam did not improved. They have  worsened severely.  The Vietnamese government removed Father Nguyen Van Ly from his parish and on  March 30th sentenced him to 8 years in prison  for allegedly conducting propaganda activities  to harm the security of the state. His sentence  is an outrage.  Vietnamese police, on March 6, 2007, arrested a pair of human-rights lawyers, Nguyen  Van Dai (‘‘Die’’) and Le Thi Cong Nhan (pronounced  ‘‘Lay Tee Kohng Nhun’’),  for organizing training sessions for political activists in  the capital. There are many other dissidents  who have been imprisoned simply for expressing their thoughts and attempting to practice  their faith freely and openly. Nguyen Van Dai  has since been charged with disseminating  propaganda against the Socialist Republic of  Vietnam, and faces up to 20 years in prison if  convicted. Their  trials and  sentencing are  scheduled for this Friday in Vietnam.  Le Quoc Quan (‘‘Lay Kwook Kwun’’) and his  law colleague Tran Thuy Trang (‘‘Truhn Twee  Trahng’’) were arrested on the day Mr. Quan  returned to Vietnam from his congressionally-  sponsored National Endowment  for Democracy fellowship in the United States. His arrest  is not only a human rights violation, it is a calculated  insult  to America and specifically  to  the United States Congress.  With all of  the human  rights problems  in  Vietnam, the question we must ask is, ‘‘What  can we do to help?’’ The United States has  the power to influence Vietnam on these important moral issues through the use of our  many diplomatic and economic tools—if only  we have the political will and moral courage to  use these tools.  One tool is the Countries of Particular Concern list.  I believe it was a mistake to take Vietnam  off the list. I agree with the U.S. Commission  on International Religious Freedom that Secretary Rice  should  redesignate Vietnam a  Country of Particular Concern.  I believe the U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam,  Michael Marine, should provide financial support to the loved ones of the political detainees, using the Human Rights Defender’s fund.  The wives of many of these political prisoners  are left without any financial support. We have  a moral commitment not just to these people  who have been imprisoned unjustly; we have  a moral obligation to relieve the financial burden  that  these arrests have caused  for  the  families of the brave.  Vietnam  claims  it  has made  significant  progress in allowing more freedom of religion  under  its Ordinance on Belief and Religion,  but this is simply untrue. Under this law, affiliated organizations of  recognized  churches  may ‘‘register for religious operation.’’ In practice, however, only 2.5 percent of all house  churches have been approved for registration.  And of the one hundred house churches that  actually have been registered, only five have  been registered for religious operation. No real  progress has been made.  Until Vietnam makes real progress on religious freedoms and human rights, instead of  paying lip service in order to get trade agreements, I will continue to press this administration  to stand up  for  the  rights of  the Vietnamese people to speak their minds and practice their faith.  f  SUPPORT FOR H.R. 1429,  IMPROVING HEAD START ACT  HON. BETTY McCOLLUM  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 14, 2007  ",2007
1187,106,2007-05-14,Ms. MCCOLLUM  of Minnesota.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  1429,  the  Improving Head Start Act. Having  had the opportunity to serve on the Education  and Workforce committee  for 6 years,  I am  very pleased to have the opportunity today to  finally vote for a Head Start reauthorization bill  that will improve on the success of this critical  program.  Head Start  is one of  the most successful  programs  funded  by Congress. Research  shows  that children who attend Head Start  enter school better prepared, are less likely to  need special education services, and are more  likely  to graduate. The Minneapolis Federal  Reserve Bank reported a few years ago that  there is actually a 16 percent rate of return on  investment  in quality early education.  In my  opinion,  funding education  for our youngest  children is the most efficient and important investment we can make.  The biggest challenge facing Head Start has  been  lack of  resources.  In Minnesota,  less  than half the children eligible for Head Start  are served due to funding shortages. And nationwide, only 2 percent of children eligible for  Early Head Start receive services. We can do  better.  Increasing access  to Head Start  is  good for children, for families, for communities  and for the federal budget.  The Improving Head Start Act will expand  and improve Head Start. It will allow access  for 10,000 more children and prioritize expanding Early Head Start. It increases teacher  qualifications  and  helps  to  attract  quality  teachers by improving salaries. It will also improve coordination with other early education  programs, ensure that parents continue to play  VerDate Aug 31 2005  05:20 May 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A14MY8.028 E14MYPT1 S K R A M E R h t i w 6 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l i t s k c o t s m         ",2007

1191,6,2007-05-21,Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts.," Mr.  Speaker, the House today revisits the  subject of the industrial loan corporation.  Industrial  loan  corporations were  created early in the last century as a  kind of a niche at a time when it was  felt  that banks did not adequately  serve working people, people of lower  incomes.  When Congress dealt with the situation of banking reform in the 1980s,  Congress decided to limit this form to  six States, which now have the right to  issue industrial loan charters, and recognize  that  the general business of  banking was now being carried out in a  way that did not require these niche  banks, which Congress did not want to  at that time wipe out banks that had  been appropriately established under  existing law.  But  it’s clear  that  they were  regarded as a somewhat nonconforming  use. There are people today who talk  about what a good thing the industrial  loan corporations are. None of them,  however, seem to me to have shown the  courage of their convictions, because  those who believe that the industrial  loan corporation should continue to  flourish and grow, as will happen if we  don’t pass the bill, ought to be abolishing that restriction that says only  six States can issue those charters.  I cannot think of any other financial  instrument of which we have general  approval where only six States are allowed  to charter  them. People who  genuinely believe in the ILCs are the  ones who ought to be pushing legislation. They do not. They implicitly accept the fact that they are an exception to a general principle.  The particular general principle to  which they are an exception is the one  which we have affirmed recently when  we did the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill,  namely that banking and commerce  should be separate.  Now, let me be very clear. If an entity that is in the manufacturing business or the retail business or any other  business wants to get into financing its  purchases,  or  even wants  to  lend  money to people, they wouldn’t be affected by this as long as they were willing to forgo deposit insurance.  We are here because if you become an  official bank, as ILCs can be to this extent, you get various benefits from the  Federal Government, including deposit  insurance. So this is not the Federal  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:04 May 22, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A21MY7.004 H21MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 7 C P D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

1199,20,2007-05-21,Mr. MELANCON.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am here today with a  resolution with my  friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. MARIODIAZ-  BALART), that will help to make America aware of hurricanes and the devastation. This  resolution  supports  the  goals and ideals of National Hurricane  Preparedness Week. It encourages the  staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, especially  at the National Weather Service and  the National Hurricane Center  and  other appropriate Federal agencies, to  continue  their outstanding work  to  educate people  in the United States  about hurricane preparedness.  It also urges the people of the United  States to recognize such a week as an  opportunity to learn more about the  work of the National Hurricane Center  to forecast hurricanes and to educate  citizens about the potential risks associated with hurricanes.  In light of the storms and devastation caused by Katrina and Rita in August and September of 2005, I think it  is appropriate that America be aware  of the situations with hurricanes, particularly since some 53 percent of all  Americans live along the coastal areas  of this country.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr. MARIO DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  gentleman from Louisiana for his help.  Before I discuss this important issue, I  want to thank Chairman GORDONand  Ranking Member HALLand their great  staffs for allowing this important resolution that has been brought here before you to move forward so quickly.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of House Resolution 402, supporting the  goals and ideals of National Hurricane  Preparedness Week as established by  the National Hurricane Center. Hurricane Preparedness Week began yesterday, May 20, and lasts through May 26  of this year.  Next Friday, June 1, marks the beginning of the hurricane season, unfortunately, in the Atlantic and central  Pacific Oceans. Hurricane season lasts  6 months, until November 30, and those  are 6 months that those of us in Florida pay close attention to.  The goal of Hurricane Preparedness  Week is to inform the public about hurricane hazards and to provide knowledge that can be used to take action.  We have to be ready. This information  can be used to save lives and to protect  your home and your property.  History has taught us that a lack of  hurricane awareness and preparation  are common among all major hurricane disasters, but by knowing your  vulnerability and what actions you as  an individual and family can take, you  can reduce the effects of a hurricane  disaster.  One of the biggest  lessons  learned  from the recent wave of hurricanes is  that residents should have enough supplies to survive for at least 3 days after  the landfall of a hurricane. Oftentimes  government and law enforcement personnel are engaged in restoring safety  and calming the situation and trying  to reach people after a landfall of a  hurricane.  Ideally  residents  should  have enough food, water and supplies  to at least last them 3 days until the  authorities can actually get there and  lend a hand.  Millions  of Americans  face  great  risks from tropical storms and hurricanes. More than 50 percent of Americans live along the coast, and millions  of tourists visit the oceans and the  coasts each year.  The statistics associated with hurricanes are frankly staggering. An average of 11 tropical storms develop each  year over the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Six  of those storms will probably become  hurricanes.  The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season  was the busiest on record, including 28  named storms, 15 hurricanes in which 7  were a Category 3 or higher. As a  Coastal State, Floridians are keenly  aware of Mother Nature’s wrath and  fury, especially when it comes to hurricanes.  In just 2 short years, eight hurricanes  have made  landfall  in Florida  from  2004–2005. They were Charlie, Frances,  Ivan, Jeanne, Dennis, Katrina, Wilma  and Rita. We have heard and read and  had to deal with the consequences of  those storms.  As we have learned in the past few  years, hurricanes pose serious threats  to our country. Unfortunately, massive  storms can result in casualties, deaths,  and millions of dollars  in economic  damage and destruction. During hurricanes, homes,  businesses  and  other  buildings can be damaged by heavy  rain, strong winds, and storm surge.  Homes can be flooded. Tornadoes can  be spun off, and power can be wiped out  for  days  or weeks  and  sometimes  longer.  Experts at NOAA’s National Hurricane Center in the National Weather  Service agree that it is critical to do a  few things: Number one, to determine  if you live in a hurricane-prone area.  Much of Florida is. Also, know your  home’s vulnerabilities to storm surge,  flooding, wind, and develop a written  family  disaster  plan  based  on  this  knowledge.  Once you  determine your  vulnerability to a hurricane, the National  Hurricane  Center  recommends  that  people in hurricane-prone areas, such  as Florida, assemble a disaster supply  kit before the hurricane season begins.  Be ready now; don’t wait until the  storm  is on  its way. That  includes  things like a first aid kit with essential  medications, and nonperishable  food  items such as canned goods; at least 3  gallons of water per person per day for  at least 3 to 7 days, and that is crucial.  You might be able to survive without a  lot of things, but you cannot survive  without clean water. They recommend  battery-powered radios and flashlights  and extra batteries; and special items,  including  formula  for  infants,  and  medications  for  elderly  or  disabled  family members.  As we have learned in south Florida,  the forecasters, the meteorologists and  hurricane specialists at the National  Hurricane Center are often the best  source of the most valuable information on hurricane preparedness. They  spend countless hours providing valuable information and warnings to individuals located in the potential path of  a hurricane, and millions of Americans  have come to rely on their steady advice and counsel.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Americans  living in hurricane-prone areas to use  Hurricane Preparedness Week as an opportunity to learn more about the approaching hurricane season and to be  prepared before a hurricane threatens  our land. We must all learn from our  experiences and be prepared.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

Mr. Speaker, Mr. MARIODIAZ-BALART  covered the subject matter of the resolution with a tremendous explanation  of why we need to be attentive to National Hurricane Week. This June 1 begins the 2007 hurricane season here in  the United States, and I hope that recognition here on the floor today will  make people aware  throughout  this  country, particularly  the people affected by these hurricanes, aware of  the dangers and the need to pay attention to oncoming storms.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Mr. MARIO DIAZ-BALART of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS), who I served with in the State  legislature.  ",2007

It is a very important resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of this resolution supporting  the goals and ideals of National Hurricane Preparedness Week.  As we approach what is expected to  be yet another very active hurricane  season, it is imperative that we help  raise awareness on the importance of  being the best prepared for the worst-  case scenario.  How can any of us ever forget the  horrific scenes etched into our minds  after witnessing the devastation caused  by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita? Nearly 2 years later, the gulf coast region  and those affected by these storms are  still suffering.  I was alarmed when FEMA Director  David Paulison  testified  before  the  Homeland  Security  Committee  last  week and informed us that FEMA’s revised national response plan will not be  completed until sometime in June.

1204,41,2007-05-21,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr. Speaker, in  recent months, the American people  have been riveted by the disclosure surrounding the firing of eight U.S. Attorneys,  including John McKay of my  hometown of Seattle.  The other day, the number two person at the Justice Department testified  before  the  Senate  Judiciary  Committee. Even  in  jaded Washington,  D.C., the revelations were so shocking  that the Washington Post published an  editorial, which I submit for printing  in the RECORD. Let me read part of it.  ‘‘James B. Comey, the straight-as-an-  arrow former number two official of  the Justice Department, yesterday offered the Senate Judiciary Committee  an account of Bush administration lawlessness so shocking it would have been  unbelievable coming from a less reputable source.’’  The  American  people  understand  that political appointees are a fact of  life when a new President takes office,  but the American people demand that  competence and integrity overrule political party affiliation.  The Justice Department has thousands of dedicated public servants who  know what it means to be respected  and uphold the law. And then there is  Gonzalez.  The revelations began over the firing  of eight U.S. Attorneys. Now there is a  new revelation about Gonzalez trying  to force the previous Attorney General  to agree to anything the White House  wanted. What else don’t we know?  For the last 6 years, congressional  oversight was nonexistent. What cases  were priorities and what cases were  not? And why not? What did and did  not happen following the murder of an  Assistant U.S. Attorney in Seattle?  My friend, Tom Wales, had been the  Assistant U.S. Attorney  in Seattle  under the previous administration. He  was a well-respected law enforcement  officer known for his pursuit of white  color criminals. He was also a vocal  and strong advocate for gun control.  Tom was shot and killed in his home  while working at his computer one late  night in October. If Tom was killed, as  some  suspect,  because  of  those he  brought to justice, then he died in the  line of duty. No one has ever been  charged, although there are news accounts that indicate authorities have a  prime suspect.  Now there is a new suspicion. Did the  White House want its appointee in Seattle, John McKay, fired in part because he was vigorously pursuing the  Tom Wales case?  Someone  sent me a blog  recently  asking the same fundamental question:  Why would Justice not throw every  available resource into finding Tom’s  killer? Why would they not want the  investigation by their own U.S. Attorney in Seattle to proceed with every  possible resource?  Some bloggers say it is all because of  Tom’s advocacy for gun control, but  the answer may be tragically simpler.  Maybe Gonzalez wanted the Republican  U.S. Attorney appointee in Seattle to  spend all his time on something else; to  find or, if necessary, invent voter fraud  in a close Washington governor’s race,  narrowly won by the Democrat. Could  they have been  that arrogant,  that  uncaring about the death of a good  man, an Assistant U.S. Attorney? Most  people would have dismissed that notion until recently. Now the revelations about the Attorney General and  the attitude he took toward cases, perhaps including the murder of a Federal  officer in Seattle, cannot be adequately  described by words like shocking.  At this point, I believe there are two  necessary mandatory  actions  that  must be taken. The Attorney General  must go, now. His allegiance to partisan political interests above his oath  to uphold the laws of the United States  is outrageous.  Secondly, even if it requires the appointment of an outside independent  prosecutor,  the  Justice Department  should  immediately,  vigorously  and  conclusively investigate the murder of  Tom Wales and not stop until the killer is charged and brought to justice.  We owe that to Tom Wales, his family,  and every law enforcement officer who  risks his or her life every day in service  to the American people.  [From the Washington Post, May 16, 2007]  MR. COMEY’STALE: A STANDOFFATAHOSPITALBEDSIDESPEAKSVOLUMESABOUTATTORNEYGENERALGONZALES  James B. Comey, the straight-as-an-arrow  former No. 2 official at the Justice Department, yesterday offered the Senate Judiciary  Committee an account of Bush administration lawlessness so shocking it would have  been unbelievable coming from a less reputable source. The episode involved a 2004  nighttime visit to the hospital room of then-  Attorney General  John D. Ashcroft  by  Alberto Gonzales,  then  the White House  counsel, and Andrew H. Card Jr., then the  White House chief of staff. Only the broadest  outlines of this visit were previously known:  that Mr. Comey, who was acting as attorney  general during Mr. Ashcroft’s illness, had refused to recertify the legality of the administration’s warrantless wiretapping program;  that Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Card had tried to  do an end-run around Mr. Comey; that Mr.  Ashcroft had rebuffed them.  Mr. Comey’s vivid depiction, worthy of a  Hollywood  script,  showed  the  lengths  to  which the administration and the man who  is now attorney general were willing to go to  pursue the surveillance program. First, they  tried to coerce a man in intensive care—a  man so sick he had transferred the reins of  power to Mr. Comey—to grant them legal approval. Having failed, they were willing to  defy the conclusions of the nation’s chief law  enforcement officer and pursue the surveillance without Justice’s authorization. Only  in the face of the prospect of mass resignations—Mr. Comey, FBI Director Robert S.  Mueller III and most  likely Mr. Ashcroft  himself—did the president back down.  As Mr. Comey testified, ‘‘I couldn’t stay, if  the administration was going to engage in  conduct that the Department of Justice had  said had no  legal basis.’’ The crisis was  averted only when, the morning after the  program was reauthorized without Justice’s  approval, President Bush agreed to fix whatever problem Justice had with it (the details  remain classified). ‘‘We had the president’s  direction to do . . . what the Justice Department believed was necessary to put this matter on a footing where we could certify to its  legality,’’ Mr. Comey said.  The dramatic details should not obscure  the bottom line: the administration’s alarming willingness, championed by, among others, Vice President Cheney and his counsel,  David Addington, to ignore its own lawyers.  Remember, this was a Justice Department  that had embraced an expansive view of the  president’s inherent constitutional powers,  allowing the administration to dispense with  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:56 May 22, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K21MY7.046 H21MYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 4 7 C P D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007
1205,48,2007-05-21,Mr. HARE.," I thank my friend from  California. And let me just say that  those who would question your intelligence and your wisdom on this issue  of trade do so at their own peril.  Now, if I could, Mr. Speaker, introduce someone I have known for many  years prior to coming to the House of  Representatives,  a  person who  has  stood up for senior citizens, working  people in her legislative district here  in Congress, and someone who serves as  my mentor and a great friend, someone  who  is never afraid to take on the  tough battles, my friend I would like to  introduce, JANSCHAKOWSKY.  ",2007
1206,48,2007-05-21,Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.," I thank the gentleman whose leadership I appreciate  so much on this very important issue.  You have beautifully filled the footsteps, the shoes, of your predecessor,  Congressman Lane Evans, who was also  a champion for workers’ rights, for the  rights of ordinary people. And I appreciate that you are standing up for millions of American workers who have  suffered from the trade policies that we  have had.  b2015  I think it is important to note that  the new class of Members who joined  this Congress, far from being unsophisticated, understand that the trade policies that have been negotiated have  harmed their constituents not just in  the Rust Belt of  the Midwest but  around this country and brought those  issues to their constituents and, vice  versa, listened to their constituents.  Look, we all understand that this is a  global world, that globalization is a reality, but now we need to control it  and this Congress now has to reassert  its authority over U.S. trade policy. We  have an opportunity to do that now, to  make sure that it works not only for  the wealthiest multinational corporations but for workers and for our environment. So I appreciate very much  the leadership that others have shown,  particularly you, Mr. HARE,  tonight  with this special order.  On May 10, 2007, the Bush administration officials and congressional leaders  announced a new trade deal. While the  agreement does show real progress in  terms of moving the Bush administration in the direction of enforcing labor  and environmental standards, the details of the negotiated package and  their real-life impact are not clear and  are troubling.  So while I want to applaud the work  of Chairman RANGEL and others  to  make major improvements to the labor  and environmental provisions, I have  to say, frankly, that I have no confidence that the Bush administration,  the same administration that has relentlessly attacked the rights of workers right here at home, let alone in  other countries, would enforce those  standards.  We have yet to see the text of the  proposed agreements, ‘‘the deal,’’ but a  detailed  description has  been made  available by the Ways and Means Committee and the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative, and  I am concerned  that an outdated trade model that has  decimated U.S. manufacturing remains  intact.  Over 3 million manufacturing  jobs  have been lost since NAFTA took effect. I think many of those who voted  for NAFTA would agree that it has not  worked out  in  favor of  the United  States and  its workers, or Mexican  workers either, for that matter. American wages since then have stagnated  and our trade deficit has ballooned to a  staggering  $717 billion.  It  is not a  model we want to mimic. It is no wonder that no union or environmental  group or small business has supported  the deal, while all of big business has.  There are those who suggest that  those of us who have serious questions  about the deal on trade are just mad  about being left out of a press conference or, similarly, are wasting time  so we delay the process. But the truth  is there are substantive critical issues  that affect these millions of Americans  that we are speaking for tonight.  The deal provides no assurances, for  example, against a  free trade agreement with Colombia, the country with  the world’s highest rate of labor union  assassinations, or countries like Korea  that continue to use every means to  block American products, or the renewal of Fast Track trade authority.  Instead of delivering on the public’s  demand for a new trade policy, the deal  facilitates more Bush trade deals that  contain the worst provisions of NAFTA  and CAFTA. Even if the deal is 100 percent  implemented,  resulting  trade  pacts  would  extend  the  NAFTA–  CAFTA model.

1207,69,2007-05-21,Mr.  BUNNING.," Mr.  President,  I  thank Senator SESSIONSand thank him  for his input and insight into what has  gone on  for the  last 8 weeks or 10  weeks. I thank the Senator for his explanation today on his perception of  what is in this bill. I wish to add a few  other comments, and I do have a couple  charts that are on their way down to  the Chamber.  I rise to address some of the concerns  I have about last week’s so-called immigration compromise and the way it  is  being  shoved—or  trying  to  be  shoved—through the Senate this week.  Last  week’s  so-called  immigration  agreement is not a compromise in the  traditional sense of the word. The proposal was written in secret by a small  group of Senators and our current administration. This bill may not be a  compromise, but it is compromising to  this country’s economy, national security, and the very foundation as a democracy rooted in the rule of law.  America  is a democracy operating  under the rule of law. Since the very  beginning of the American experiment,  people came from all over this world—  many countries with corrupt governments—where the law only applied to  some and could be bought by the highest bidder for others. They came to live  where the Government respects the individual and where the individual respects the law.  From our recent history, we have  seen an alarming increase in immigration from people who don’t think they  have to wait in line or play by our  rules. Instead of punishing these people, a few Senators and the administration have crafted a large-scale ‘‘get out  of jail free’’ pass. No matter what you  call it—X, Y, or Z visas—this bill will  grant amnesty to millions of  illegal  immigrants all over this country. My  wife and  I, our 9 kids, and our 35  grandkids are all descendants of immigrants. Mary and I have taught our  family to be grateful for our Nation’s  rich  tradition  of  immigration. But  more importantly, we have tried to instill in our family a deep respect of  law. Appreciating  the  contributions  the  immigrant brings to our Nation  does not mean we will surrender the  right of our Nation and its citizens to  decide who comes here.  Like many people in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and all over this  Nation, I have serious concerns about  an  immigration policy  that  rewards  lawbreakers. Is granting amnesty to  those who were  lucky enough to be  born or get to one of our border countries, and enter our country illegally,  fair to those potential immigrants who  have been waiting in other parts of the  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:21 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S21MY7.REC S21MY7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007

First, to the majority leader, Senator  REID, for having kept the feet to the  fire in this Chamber so that we finally  will have an opportunity to move on to  one of the most important national security  issues  that our Nation  faces  today. I appreciate his efforts and his  leadership to help lead our country in a  way where we deal effectively with this  very difficult and contentious issue of  immigration reform.  I also thank the President of the  United States, President Bush, and his  Cabinet  Secretaries  Chertoff  and  Gutierrez for the work they have done  now over the last 3 months as we have  tried to put together a comprehensive  immigration reform proposal that will  work for our country.  I thank my colleagues in the Senate,  both Republicans and Democrats, who  have come together in good faith to try  to deal with this very important issue.  I know we have a long week ahead of us  as we move forward with the immigration debate on the reform proposal in  the Senate.

1220,83,2007-05-21,Mr. DOMENICI.," Madam President, I  thank the Senator from Florida for his  dedicated work on this bill and for his  efforts heretofore a couple of years ago,  when he worked very hard on  this  issue. We  didn’t have  success,  but  maybe this bill, in spite of all the early  talk against it, may succeed. Maybe  with some amendments and some work  it may become the new law with reference to illegal aliens for the United  States of America. It is good enough  for America. It is sufficiently clear for  America. It will clear up the status of  the  10  to  12 million undocumented  aliens who live here. It will clear that  problem up. Everywhere you look, we  have let the problems of illegal aliens  grow out of all proportions.  It is a hard job to put a bill like this  together. It is not easy. It is one of the  most difficult jobs you can have to put  legislation together to try to fix the  last 15 years of letting our laws be ignored. We have not cared about them,  letting the borders become porous, letting millions of people  in  illegally,  which has caused all kinds of problems.  But I can tell you, if you look at this  bill carefully and you don’t look at it  with any preconceived  ideas or  ideology, but look at it and ask: What are  the practical problems and what are  the practical solutions here? I submit  that it comes close to solving these  problems in the very best way possible.  I am sorry I already heard this morning Senators talking for a very long period  of  time  about why  they  are  against this bill. In the end, I listened  and, after listening, I concluded that  most of them had it wrong. I don’t like  to say that about my fellow Senators,  but they had it wrong on the major  issues, which they said made up their  mind to be against the bill.  Let me tell you what is going to happen under this bill. Before anything  else in this bill is used or implemented,  our borders must be secure. Let me repeat: whatever you hear from Senators  that this bill is going to do, none of  those provisions are going to be implemented unless and until we have secured the border. I don’t know how we  can say it any clearer. Senator KENNEDYand Senator JONKYL from Arizona, the leaders on each side on this  issue with Senator SPECTER, maybe  what you are going to have to do is  pull the text of this bill that secures  the border and distribute it to the Senators so they will have it right in front  of them to see that there is a border security part of this bill. It is there. It  says, before you can  implement the  other provisions of this bill, the border  will be made secure.  It doesn’t stop there. It tells you  what a secure border is. It says 18,000  Border Patrol agents must be hired. We  are well on a path of getting them  hired and trained. We can do this because we finally, for the last 3 years,  we have been funding. We have been  hiring thousands of them. But the bill  says none of the bill’s other provisions  shall go into effect until the border is  made secure.  Then it says that secure means 370  miles of border fencing must be built.  The Department of Homeland Security  is committed to building 370 miles by  December 31, 2008. We are being honest.  We didn’t have to say that date. We  didn’t have to talk about it. But we  cannot get fencing built any sooner. So  that period of time is going to have to  be used before we do other things in  the bill. The bill cannot change anybody’s status this year because those  provisions are dormant until the border is made secure. They are dormant.  It also says 200 miles of vehicular  barriers must be in place. It says 70  radar and camera towers must be on  the southern border. It says four unmanned aerial vehicles must be in operation we have to leave undocumented  aliens apprehended on the border in detention facilities to wait until they are  deported. Right now if you don’t have a  place  for  them,  the  judges  release  them. That has been one of our problems. The bill has 27,500 detention beds  to end  the  ‘‘catch and  release program’’, which we are aware of, those of  us who represent the border. You have  to have all that done before the bill becomes operative.  So if any one of those is not done, it  is just like not having an immigration  reform bill; isn’t that correct?  ",2007
1221,83,2007-05-21,Mr. MARTINEZ., That is right.  ,2007
1222,83,2007-05-21,Mr. DOMENICI.," People say you are  going to do immigration reform before  the border is secured. How are we going  to do that when the law says you throw  the rest of the bill away until we have  secured the border, and then it tells  you what border security is? That has  been worked on day and night. That  has been done to try to calm so many  thousands of people who have been indoctrinated to believe that the only  thing we should do is make the border  secure. So all they are going to ask you  when you go home is: Did you secure  the border, Senator? And, Senator, I  heard  from such and such that you  didn’t secure the border.  Senators ought to carry around a  piece of paper that has this border security provision on it, and you ought  to take it out and read it to your constituents. They deserve the truth. They  want the truth. We are not trying to do  anything to hide what we did. We are  trying to make sure they know it.  I mentioned the name of a Senator  from Arizona.

The Senator  from Connecticut approaches this issue, which is an important issue—it is a real issue; we have to  deal with  it—in a way which he  is  known for in this Senate, which is in a  thoughtful, constructive way, a way  which takes into account the concerns  and the impact upon employees, upon  consumers, and, perhaps most importantly, upon our kids and grandkids in  the next generation. For that I thank  him and say it is a privilege to work  with him—a man of great character  and great dedication.  Mr. President, with that I yield the  floor.  f  U.S. TRADE POLICY  ",2007
1225,90,2007-05-21,Mr. BROWN.," Mr. President, the trade  policies set in Washington and negotiated across the globe have a direct  impact on places such as Toledo and  Steubenville, on Cleveland and Hamilton. That is why voters in my State  of Ohio and across the country sent a  message loudly and clearly in November demanding a new direction, a very  different  direction  for  our Nation’s  trade policy.  Working men and women  in Ohio  know that job loss doesn’t just affect  the worker or just the worker’s family;  job loss—especially the kind of job loss  we have seen in the last 5 years, the  kind of manufacturing job loss—when  we see that kind of job loss in the thousands, that job loss devastates communities.  It  hurts  the  local  business  owner,  the  drugstore,  the  grocery  store, the neighborhood restaurant. It  hurts communities. It hurts schools. It  hurts police forces. It hurts fire departments.  Two weeks ago,  leadership  in  the  House of Representatives and in the  White House announced a new outline  for  trade policy, one  that  included  labor  and  environmental  standards.  The fact that the Bush administration  was willing to negotiate at all, the fact  that they were willing to pay even lip  service  to  labor and  environmental  standards, underscores the November  elections’ importance.  Every Member of Congress,  in the  Senate and  in  the other body,  the  House of Representatives, is now on notice that we will be held accountable  for our  trade votes—accountable  to  workers, accountable to business owners—accountable  for our trade votes  and accountable  for American trade  policy when we go home. However,  since the announcement made by the  Bush administration and some congressional leaders in the House about labor  and  environmental  standards,  backpedaling by  the administration and  sidestepping by supporters of the deal  indicate that we may be in for another  round of more of the same in our trade  policy.  The administration already has hinted at side deals for labor standards instead of putting those standards in the  central, core part of the agreement.  They are talking now about not reopening negotiations with Peru and  not reopening negotiations with Panama but instead adding a little sidebar,  a little letter, a little statement of support for environmental labor standards  but not actually putting them in the  central core of the agreement. If that  is the case, if these labor and environmental standards are not in the agreement but in a side letter of some sort,  then really,  frankly, nothing new  is  being offered. It is the same old jalopy  with a new coat of paint.  Voters in my State demanded real  change, not symbolic gestures.  What is even more disturbing about  the new outline is it appears to rely in  good faith on the administration to enforce standards. Given this administration’s abysmal record on enforcement  of labor standards and environmental  standards, not just in trade agreements  but enforcement of those standards in  our domestic economy, we know what  this administration—we know its failed  environmental policies. Given this administration’s abysmal record on enforcement, relying on blind trust isn’t  just foolish, it is downright irresponsible.  The Jordan Free Trade Agreement  passed by the House—I supported  it  and many others did; it passed in both  Houses  overwhelmingly—the  Jordan  Free Trade Agreement was once held  up as a standard in labor provisions. It  had strong  labor and environmental  standards in it. It passed in the year  2000, but come 2001, with a new President  of  the United States, George  Bush, and a new U.S. Trade Representative, Bob Zoellick, the Bush administration simply turned the other way  while  rampant  human-trafficking  plagues that nation of Jordan. Shortly  after the Jordan agreement was enacted, the new USTR, Bob Zoellick,  sent a letter to Jordan’s Trade Minister saying the United States simply  wouldn’t enforce the labor provisions.  So even  though we passed a  trade  agreement with labor standards inside  the core agreement, this administration, this same crowd who now says  they will enforce labor standards and  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:21 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S21MY7.REC S21MY7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007
1226,104,2007-05-21,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to introduce a joint resolution  that would grant the consent of Congress to the International Emergency  Management Assistance Memorandum  of Understanding, IEMAMOU compact.  This  joint resolution would  formally  approve of the IEMAMOU compact, a  mutual  emergency assistance agreement entered into by the New England  States,  including my home State of  Vermont and several Canadian Provinces, who are our neighbors to the  north. This mutual assistance compact, which has been agreed to and operating in principle for more than 5  years, allows for cooperation between  emergency responders  in the United  States and Canada during natural disasters and other serious emergencies.  This compact is an extraordinary example of the international cooperation  and good will which makes our countries more  secure  and  our  citizens  safer. Congress should pass this joint  resolution to give this vital compact  the full force of law.  We must all do our best to prepare  for the most serious emergencies that  can harm our communities. These crises may arise from natural or manmade disasters, or from technological  hazards or civil emergencies. As those  who live in the Northeast know, extreme weather  is not uncommon  in  New England, or in the eastern Provinces of Canada. Together with our Canadian neighbors, we have endured catastrophic blizzards and ice storms over  the years that have closed roads and  highways,  shut down power  for extended periods, and stranded travelers  and rural residents for days, or longer.  At times, we have also suffered the  misfortune of responding to serious accidents, such as train or plane crashes.  Of course, our concerns for safety surrounding  nuclear  powerplants  and  other industrial sites warrants extensive planning and preparedness for even  the possibility of technological disasters. During these events, we turn to  our first responders and our emergency  management professionals to provide  assistance and secure public safety no  matter how grave the danger, and no  matter how challenging the task.  The IEMMOU compact was created in  response to the devastating ice storm  of 1998. In January of that year, an unprecedented 3-day ice storm paralyzed  portions of the northern New England  States  and  the  adjacent  Canadian  Provinces causing massive damage to  the electrical and transportation infrastructure. Millions were  left  in  the  dark for days and even weeks, leaving  more than 30 dead and shutting down  normal activities in large cities like  Montreal and Ottawa. Following this  devastation,  the governors and premiers of those regions affected recognized the need for greater cross-border  emergency cooperation, and they directed  their emergency management  leaders to develop and create a memorandum  of  understanding  on  these  issues that benefit all parties north  and  south  of  the  border.  The  IEMAMOU compact was the result of  this collaborative, international process, and now stands as a model compact  for  cross-border mutual  emergency assistance.  The compact allows for international  sharing of resources and expertise in  times of extreme emergency or disaster. For example, rural States, such  as my own, may need to call upon specialized resources found in other larger  States or neighboring Provinces to respond immediately to events, such as  chemical disasters or mass transit accidents. With natural disasters, such as  prolonged, severe winter storms, the  areas affected may be so vast, stretching across several States or Provinces  that no single jurisdiction alone could  respond fully to the crisis. There are  also events that occur along or near  our border with Canada which require  the  immediate response and  full cooperation of States and Provinces in  both nations. The IEMAMOU compact  meets these needs with a thoughtful  and forward-looking outline of how to  address issues that face first responders and their managers  in times of  cross-border emergency.  This international compact provides  a legal framework for cooperation and  mutual assistance between the States  of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine,  Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, and the Canadian Provinces  of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward  Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. The compact  requires  each participating member,  whether State or Province, to formulate plans and programs to facilitate  international and interstate or provincial cooperation in case of natural or  manmade disaster, technological hazard, or civil emergency. The compact  also provides for the temporary suspension of statutes or ordinances in each  jurisdiction that may impede the implementation of these plans. For example, under the compact, government officials and law enforcement authorities  from one member State or Province  can officially work in other jurisdictions during times of emergency, a circumstance that would not be permitted  otherwise.  The compact also creates a formal  mechanism for making assistance requests from one state or province to  another, and encourages frequent consultation between the emergency management  leaders to develop  free exchange of  information and resources  across borders. In addition, the compact provides a Good Samaritan provision, which gives liability protection  for emergency responders who act in  good faith in providing assistance in a  legal  jurisdiction outside their own,  and creates reciprocal workers compensation and other benefits to emergency responders who may get injured  in responding to an emergency under  the compact. Finally, the compact allows for reimbursement between members States or Provinces for losses or  damages incurred in responding under  the agreement.  All members of this compact have  agreed to its terms and join in requesting Congress’s consent for the agreement.  Vermont,  New  Hampshire,  Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode  Island,  and  Connecticut  have  joined  the  IEMAMOU compact, and many of these  States have passed legislation adopting  the compact under State law.

1227,118,2007-05-21,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr. Speaker.  I  rise  today  in  support of S. Con. Res. 21, a budget resolution designed and drafted by Democrats  to  end over a decade of Republican fiscal irresponsibility.  One of  the best results of  the Democrats  gaining the majority in the Congress is the fact  that we can realign the priorities of the Federal  government. Instead of Republican tax cuts for  the richest 1 percent, we can put those same  resources into health care for our children and  veterans. Instead of driving our Nation deeper  and deeper into debt, we can put us back on  track towards a balanced budget.  Twelve years of Republican budgets have  left our  fiscal house  in shambles. We are  nearly $9 trillion in debt, and if Republicans  had their way, we would never end the deficit.  However, the Democratic budget resolution is  a good first step towards ending the sea of  red ink on our budget. Within the next 5 years,  we will have balanced the budget, while at the  same  time providing necessary services  to  those who need them most.  This budget resolution incorporates the pay-  as-you-go rule that the Democrats passed as  one of our first acts in the majority. The rule  is simple. Any additional funds we spend, or  any taxes that we cut, have to be paid for with  cuts in other areas.  The budget resolution finally fulfills some of  the promises we made  to our military veterans. This legislation includes a $6.6 billion  increase  in veterans spending, which  is  the  largest increase in history. The Congress has  failed to meet our obligations for over a decade in providing necessary services to our veterans, and this budget aims to correct some of  this neglect.  In addition,  this budget also provides $50  billion over 5 years towards children’s health  care. The State Children’s Health  Insurance  Program  (SCHIP) has been extremely successful in improving access to healthcare for  children whose parents earn too much money  to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to purchase private health insurance. Two-thirds of  all uninsured children in this nation are actually eligible but not enrolled  in SCHIP. With  this  budget, we  can  significantly  improve  health care coverage to millions more children  across the country.  This budget resolution will also help protect  our Nation  from  its enemies. The 9/11 recommendations, most of which have been ignored by the Republican Congress, can be implemented under this budget framework. We  have  also  included  additional  funding  for  homeland security  in order  to better ensure  the safety of our citizens.  It is no great secret that the Administration  has severely underfunded schools across the  nation with the No Child Left Behind Act. This  is another program we intend to fix with our  budget resolution. In this budget, we have included $9.5 billion over what the President requested for fiscal year 2008. This necessary  funding will help stop the decline in our Nation’s education system.  Mr. Speaker, I do not have nearly enough  time  to speak about all  the benefits of  this  budget  resolution. Programs such as Head  Start, LIHEAP, Social Security and Medicare  all benefit. Residents of New Orleans and Mississippi benefit from the money to rebuild after  Katrina. Higher education students will benefit  from increased Pell Grants and we avoid cutting other student aid programs such as Perkins  loans  and  special  opportunity  block  grants, which was proposed in the President’s  failed budget plan.  I am strongly supportive of this Democratic  budget resolution. This bill will go a long way  towards putting our fiscal house in order, without relying on the massive middle class tax increase that the President’s budget relies upon.  I would urge all of my colleagues to support  this budget resolution.  f  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008  SPEECHOF  HON. GWEN MOORE  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, May 16, 2007  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 1585) to authorize  appropriations for fiscal year 2008 for military activities of the Department of Defense,  to prescribe military personnel strengths for  fiscal year 2008, and for other purposes:  ",2007
1228,118,2007-05-21,Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin.," Madam Chairman, as we debate the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill, I am pleased to note the effort  by my colleagues  in working  to ensure  that  our national defense funding and policy are focused on programs that will make our country  safer and provide our  troops  in harm’s way  with the resources they need today.  I support making sure that Congress wisely,  as well as robustly, provide  for our national  defense, including ensuring dollars are spent  on systems that will actually protect our Nation  and our allies. One of those systems drawing  new attention during this debate is missile defense. Our country has already spent over  $100 billion over the last several decades to  develop  various missile  defense  systems.  These Cold War efforts for which annual funding has increased from $3 billion in the late  1990s to nearly $10 billion have yet to bear  fruit, even as our country  faces  the grave  threat posed by  terrorists smuggling nuclear  weapons into our country across our borders  or through our ports.  Supporters will point to successful tests recently of portions of this system. However, we  all know the challenges of replicating limited  success  from  carefully and highly  scripted  tests in real world conditions. Given that participants knew  roughly when  the  test  target  would launch, what they would look like, how  they would fly and what they would do, it may  be even more concerning that these systems  missed as often as they did.  I am troubled when I hear experts such as  the Government Accountability Office  report  that while costs have grown,  less work  is  being completed  than planned. GAO  found  that  ‘‘too  few  tests have been completed  to  have confidence  in  the models and simulations used to predict performance.’’ One year  after establishing 2006 goals for the program,  the Missile Defense agency  informed Congress that it planned to field fewer assets, reduce performance goals, and  increase  the  program’s cost goal.  Our citizens and our allies and their citizens  are not made safer by rushing to deploy technology that ‘‘may’’ protect them when called  upon.  The solution to a flat tire is not to blow more  air into it. We cannot afford to expend valuable national defense dollars to develop technologies that we know today will not work at  a time when these funds can be spent to improve our homeland security, provide needed  equipment  for our  troops  in  the  field, or  increase foreign aid to our allies.  I am sure there is no need to remind my  colleagues that the $8.1 billion provided in the  bill for the missile system is more than is currently authorized for port security grants or included in the recent House-passed COPS reauthorization bill to put more police officers on  our streets.  Some have attempted to muddle this issue  by inserting the nation of Israel into the missile  defense issue. Our Nation recognizes the importance of our ally Israel and provides over  $2 billion in foreign military aid to help that nation meet its unique security challenges. However, simply putting more unproven,  insufficiently tested, and unreliable missile defense  systems  into  the  field does not make our  country or our allies safer.  I certainly believe the purpose of this $645  billion Defense authorization bill  is  to help  make our country safer including assisting our  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:56 May 22, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A21MY8.014 E21MYPT1 S K R A M E R M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007
1229,125,2007-05-21,Mr.  POE.," Madam  Speaker,  11-year-old  Christopher Ryan Coomes, or Ryan, as he is  more familiarly called, is an outstanding young  man. A native of Texas, born in Houston and  raised in the suburb of Spring, Texas, Ryan  lives a normal, average American life with his  father,  Tim, mother,  Brenda,  big  sister,  Candance, and little brother, Chase.  Ryan is finishing the 5th Grade at Salyers  Elementary in Spring, Texas; however, he is  no ordinary 5th grader because Ryan has a  gift for excelling in school. In December 2005,  when Ryan was a 4th grader, he competed in  the Salyers Elementary Spelling Bee. Spelling  the word,  ‘‘walrus,’’ Ryan was named  the  champion of  the spelling competition. When  he competed the following year, in 2006, Ryan  beat out 30 other participants and would-be  spelling bee champion hopefuls  to win by  spelling the word ‘‘staccato’’—which is a musical term, meaning to cut short or crisply. Ryan  also competed in the Spring ISD District Spelling Bee competition in February of 2007.  Spelling is not the only thing Ryan excels in.  Ryan is also an outstanding student, who has  been and is on the honor roll at Salyers Elementary. His  favorite  subjects  are  history  (which also happens to be mine), science, and  math. While most kids scheme to get out of  going to school in the morning, Ryan eagerly  gets up and goes. Currently, he is trying to  maintain a perfect attendance record for the  2006–2007 school year. Ryan has a love of  reading and is very skilled at writing, having  his work continually used by his teacher as an  example. He participates in several extra-curricular activities, such as the Chess Club and  the Safety Patrol.  Already at 11, Ryan has set goals for himself: He wants  to make Eagle Scout—an  honor only 5 percent of Boy Scouts ever  achieve; he wants to attend college at either  Texas A&M, Rice, or an Ivy League college  (Yale); he wants  to visit England and see  Stonehenge.  Ryan has been a long time member of the  Cub Scouts, which  is a division of  the Boy  Scouts. The Cub Scouts were formed for boys  in the first through fifth grades and was established to promote character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Boys involved with Cub Scouts are  required  to go  through 5 different award  levels of  the Cub  Scouts before they are promoted to the highest award level, Arrow of Light.  To be awarded the Arrow of Light, the Cub  Scout must demonstrate the specific skills and  activities of each of the previous Cub Scout  levels. The Cub Scout is also required to learn  the Scout Promise and Scout Law. Finally, the  Cub Scout is required to attend one Boy Scout  Troop meeting and one Boy Scout Troop Activity. Ryan Coomes has met all of these requirements and on March 3, 2007, he was  awarded the Arrow of Light for the Cub Scouts  of America, Pack 355.  Madam Speaker, Ryan Coomes  is a  remarkable young man. An honor student, spelling bee champion, and Cub Scout recipient of  the Arrow of Light award, Ryan is an example  to his  fellow students, his  fellow citizens of  Spring, and his fellow Texans. We need more  young people like Ryan. I congratulate Ryan  on being awarded the Arrow of Light for the  Cub Scouts and I am proud to pay him this  tribute today.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  HONORING ARMY SPECIALIST ROBERT J. DIXON OF MINNEAPOLIS  HON. KEITH ELLISON  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 21, 2007  ",2007
1230,125,2007-05-21,Mr. ELLISON.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor Army Specialist Robert J. Dixon of  Minneapolis who died on May 6th in Baghdad.  His funeral service occurred on Thursday May  18th in Minneapolis and I would like to read  the  following May  11th,  2007 Associated  Press Article about Army Specialist Dixon into  the record:  A Minneapolis soldier who graduated from  high school  in Gladwin and was  just  three  months into his tour in Iraq was killed when an  improvised explosive device detonated near  his vehicle, the military said.  Army Spc. Robert J. Dixon, 27, died May 6  in Baghdad,  the Defense Department said  Wednesday. He was assigned  to  the 1st  Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Brigade  Combat Team, 1st  Infantry Division at Fort  Riley, Kan.  Dixon was  born  in Portland, Ore.,  but  moved to Gladwin in 1992, said Irene Dixon,  who said she and her husband Daniel were  Robert Dixon’s legal guardians. In high school,  Robert was a  running back  for  the  football  team, set the school record in the 100-meter  dash and also wrestled, his mother said.  ‘‘He especially enjoyed  family activities,’’  Irene Dixon  told The Associated Press on  Thursday. ‘‘We did a lot of family activities. He  hunted, he paint-balled, he snowboarded. We  went camping, snowmobiling.  ‘‘If you ever knew Bobby, you’d love him.  Every time we got a report from a teacher it  couldn’t have been any better. We got a call  from a commander who said everybody there  (in Iraq) loved him.’’  After graduating from high school, Dixon attended Olivet College for a year and later was  briefly enrolled at Northwood University in Midland.  Dixon  joined  the Army  in  the summer of  2005, shortly after he moved to Minneapolis in  search of work, his mother said.  ‘‘He wanted to further his education, and he  always had a desire to be in the Army,’’ she  said. ‘‘He had planned to make it his career.’’  Dixon said she last heard from her son last  Friday, when he called during a funeral for her  uncle to express his condolences.  Robert Dixon is survived by his wife of 11⁄2  years, Rusty Rose-Dixon, and  two children.  Funeral arrangements were  incomplete but  were likely to take place at the Gladwin High  School gymnasium.  ‘‘I can’t even convey to you how we’re going  to miss not having him here,’’ his mother said.  ‘‘But I also know that he is a Christian and he  is with the Lord now.’’  Madam Speaker, Specialist Dixon served  our country, Minnesota and  the 5th District  with incredible distinction and made the ultimate sacrifice. I know I speak for you, the entire House of Representatives, and our country  in sending my deepest condolences to Specialist Dixon’s family and loved ones in their  time of grief.  f  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008  SPEECHOF  HON.

DEARMADAMSPEAKER: This is to notify  you formally, pursuant to Rule VIII of the  Rules of the House of Representatives, that I  have  received  a  subpoena  for  testimony  issued by the Superior Court of Madison  County, Indiana.  After consultation with the Office of General Counsel, I have determined that compliance with the subpoena is inconsistent with  the precedents and privileges of the House.  Sincerely,  Constituent Services Representative.  JOHNSHETTLE,  f  MEMORIAL DAY IN BAGHDAD  (Mr. WILSON  of  South  Carolina  asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks).  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr.  Speaker, Memorial Day last week in  Baghdad will always be special to me.  On that day, I met with General David  Petraeus,  Iraq’s  Defense  Minister  Jasim, and U.S. and Iraqi troops in a  Joint Security Station deep in the City  of Baghdad.  Then CODEL Spratt spent 2 days in  Kabul briefed by ISAF Commander Dan  McNeil, Major General Robert Durbin,  Afghan  Defense  Minister  Wardak,  President Hamid Karzai, and Brigadier  General Robert Livingston. General  Livingston commands the 218th Brigade of the South Carolina Army National Guard, which leads Task Force  Phoenix to train the Afghan army and  police.  I saw firsthand our coalition forces  stopping terrorists overseas to protect  American families at home. This meets  the threat of al Qaeda’s Zawahiri that  Iraq and Afghanistan are the central  front in the global war on terrorism.  Our capable military  leaders  should  not have their initiatives handcuffed  by Congress.  As we heard a bombing in Baghdad,  we read simultaneously of attacks in  Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Yemen, Lebanon  and Gaza. We must not  ignore  the  worldwide threats.  Congratulations to law enforcement  for stopping the bombing of JFK Airport.  In conclusion, God bless our troops,  and we will never forget September 11.  f  CONGRESSIONAL PENSIONS  (Mr. KIRK asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute).  ",2007
1233,2,2007-06-05,Mr. KIRK.," Mr. Speaker, last month,  several  former Members of Congress  cashed in their taxpayer-funded retirement checks  from  jail. After  indictment and conviction beyond a shadow  of a doubt, they are still paid each  month by the taxpayers they betrayed.  After  supporting a  limited  reform  bill on this issue, this Congress has  stopped all action on the needed reforms. We took no action in February.  We took no action in March, no action  in April and no action in May.  The House  leadership has conveniently stalled all reforms that would  kill the pension for a Member of Congress convicted of a felony for over 4  months now. Since  senior Members  have the largest pensions, you have to  wonder if they are delaying this reform  hoping that this Congress will fail, like  all of its predecessors.  Congressman JEFFERSONwas indicted  this weekend, and one group estimated  that he is entitled to a $47,000 annual  taxpayer pension.  Mr. Speaker, if we delay this reform,  future Members of Congress who are  convicted will  cash  their  taxpayer-  funded retirement checks from the jailhouse ATM.  f  b1410  ENERGY POLICY  (Mrs. BLACKBURN asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  her remarks.)  ",2007
1234,2,2007-06-05,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise today to speak on a subject that is  first on the minds and the wallets of  the American public, and that is the  cost of rising energy prices.  We are in the middle of the summer,  and prices at the pump are above $3 a  gallon in much of America. The liberal  leadership was going to fix the high gas  prices, and they have responded by offering no solutions. They offered so-  called ‘‘price gouging’’ legislation, but  it did nothing to address the root problem of high gas prices.  The American public wants innovation, not procrastination. They want  energy exploration, not bureaucratic  red tape. They want this Congress to do  their jobs and put forth a plan that will  power this country, self sufficiently,  into this century and beyond. The liberal leadership, meanwhile, is missing  in action on the issue.  America needs to change the way we  look at how we produce energy, and in  the next couple of weeks the Republican Conference will take the lead in  unfurling a long-term energy plan for  the future. It will not only address our  immediate power concerns but those  for decades to come.  f  ONE MORE PEACE OFFICER SHOT  BY ONE MORE ILLEGAL  (Mr. POE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

The bill would express recognition by  the House of Representatives of the importance of the Ouachita National Forest on its centennial.  The Ouachita is the largest and the  oldest national forest in the southern  region of the United States.  On December 18, 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed the establishment of what he called Arkansas  National Forest. Nineteen years later,  by Executive order, President Calvin  Coolidge changed the name of the forest to the Ouachita National Forest,  reflecting the name of both the local  mountains and the main river running  through the forest.  The  forest encompasses six wilderness areas, seven scenic areas and 11  shooting  ranges, as well as  35  recreational areas,  including the 26,445-  acre Winding Stair National Recreation Area.  Mr. Speaker, Ouachita  is a noteworthy unit of our National Forest  System, and it is appropriate that we  take this action today to celebrate the  forest’s centennial.  I want to commend and congratulate  my colleague, Representative ROSS, for  his commitment and leadership on this  matter. We  support  the passage of  House Resolution 390 and urge its adoption by the House today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the only  Member in the history of Congress who  survived the Holocaust and was liberated by the Russian Army. I was therefore opposed to the decision and continue to remain opposed to the decision  by the government of Estonia to move  a memorial honoring Russian soldiers  for  their  historic  sacrifice  during  World War II in liberating Estonia and  many other parts of Europe from Hitler’s domination. What  came afterward, however, is an entirely different  issue.  On April 27, over 1,000 pro-Russian  demonstrators gathered in Tallinn, the  beautiful  small  capital  of Estonia.  That group soon got out of control.  Riots broke out across the city. Finally, over 150 people were injured. One  person died.  The next day, the Embassy of Estonia  in Moscow was  surrounded  by  angry, pro-Russian demonstrators who  demanded the resignation of the government of Estonia. The Estonian ambassador was physically attacked by  demonstrators during an official press  conference. Even the Swedish ambassador to Russia was assaulted when he  left the Estonian Embassy in Moscow.  Since the initial riots in Tallinn, the  Estonian  government  has  reported  other coordinated attacks against its  Embassies in Helsinki, Finland; Oslo,  Norway; Copenhagen, Denmark; Stockholm, Sweden; Riga; Prague and Kiev.  The Estonian government, with the  assistance of NATO, has also been investigating cyber attacks against the  government’s Web  site,  as well  as  against the computer systems of political parties, banks, and media organizations in Estonia. Cyber attacks in  this day and age, Mr. Speaker, can be  devastating. The Estonian government  estimates that these attacks cost the  targets tens of millions of Euros, a significant sum for a small country like  Estonia.  These incidents of violence have been  condemned by a host of European institutions. The European Commission has  expressed its solidarity with Estonia  and urged Russia to respect its obligations under the Vienna Convention on  Diplomatic Relations. NATO has issued  a similar statement condemning the  violence.  So, today, we in Congress join our  friends  in Europe  in expressing our  strong disapproval of the unjustified  and  unacceptable  Russian  attacks  against Estonia, and we express our  strong solidarity with the people and  government of the great democratic  nation of Estonia.  I urge all of my colleagues to support  this all-important measure.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong support of this resolution authored by our  good friend, the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. SHIMKUS), which condemns  the violence within Estonia, condemns  the attacks on Estonia’s Embassy in  Russia that have taken place recently,  and which expresses our solidarity with  the government and the people of Estonia in the face of such violence and intimidation.  As the chairman has pointed out, the  April 27 relocation by the Estonian  government of a Soviet-era statue and  memorial, located in the capital, led  some ethnic Russians within Estonia  and some Russians in Russia itself to  undertake violent demonstrations and  threatening intimidation. These events  presented the rest of the world with  the worrisome prospect that Estonia  and other countries once held captive  by the former Soviet regime would continue  to be  subjected  to organized,  threatening behavior by their neighbor, Russia.  Additionally troublesome is the possibility that such behavior might be  supported by officials at high  levels  within the Russian government.  It is the view of the most impartial  observers that  in the days that  followed the memorial’s relocation, the  Russian government quite obviously  failed to adequately protect the Estonian Embassy in Moscow, which was  threatened for some time by a mob.  In Estonia itself, government, commercial and media Web sites observed a  series of  suspicious and devastating  cyber attacks, reportedly originating  from within Russia in what appeared to  be a very organized manner.  b1540  All of that followed very violent demonstrations mounted by some ethnic  Russians within Estonia, demonstrations that required significant engagement by the police to halt.  Mr. Speaker, since regaining their  independence with the fall of the Soviet regime, Estonia, as well as the  other Baltic States, have worked hard  to overcome the serious impact of that  decades-long occupation, a period  in  which the native population in Estonia  came close to becoming a minority, a  minority in their own land, due to the  actions of the Soviet government.  Many Baltic citizens were deemed to  be threats to that occupation and they  were shipped off to Siberia, some never  to be seen again, while ethnic Russians  were assigned by the regime to settle  in the Baltic States.  But with renewed independence, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have had  the opportunity to again take control  of their future.  To their credit, they have worked  with the Organization on Security and  Cooperation in Europe and the European Union to find ways to address the  presence of those who had been settled  on their territories during the Soviet  era, finding procedures to grant proper  citizenship that, while tough in some  cases, nevertheless provided a means  for the large ethnic Russian minorities  to participate in the civic life of those  states whose  independence was  no  longer questioned.  The European Union and the NATO  alliance recognized the efforts by these  Baltic States to constructively address  the challenges and to implement general democratic and  free market reforms.  That is why Estonia and other Baltic  States are today members of both the  European Union and NATO, and why  those organizations have stood by Estonia  in  the  face of  the disproportionate reaction to the recent relocation of the memorial, that reaction appearing to have had its roots in Moscow.  Mr. Speaker, the Baltic States have  more than earned their independence  through decades of repression and suffering under a Communist regime.  It  is  important  that  through  the  adoption of this resolution before us  today, authored by Mr. SHIMKUSof Illinois, we make it clear that we stand in  support of Estonia and its independence in the face of threats and intimidation.  Mr. Speaker,  I encourage my colleagues to join us in support of Mr.  SHIMKUS’ resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS), the author of  the resolution.

A few things of note. I continue to  follow, as the chairman knows, the occurrences  in the  former captive nations, the European Union countries,  and mostly the Baltic countries, and it  seems like we can never get to forgiveness. It seems like countries always go  back to another point in time to address their grievances.  I’ve  been  on  the  floor numerous  times to talk about Molotov-Ribbentrop, and we’ve debated that and we’ve  voted on that resolution. We  forget  about Roosevelt’s land lease deal that  was very helpful to the Soviet Union at  that time, and as the chairman’s correct, we also forget about the sacrifices  made by the Soviet Union in winning  World War II, especially on the Eastern  ber ROS-LEHTINEN VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:18 Jul 28, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\H05JN7.REC H05JN 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2007

1253,30,2007-06-05,Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California.,"  I thank the gentleman for yielding and  I thank all of my colleagues who have  spoken on this resolution and certainly  to BARBARALEE, my colleague from  California, who has been such a not  only supporter and the author of this  resolution but all of our efforts  to  change the situation in Darfur.  I had the honor to accompany Congresswoman LEE and our Speaker to  Darfur a year ago February and saw  the incredible devastation and the brutality and the genocide that is taking  place there and vowed to do whatever I  can to see if we can change it. I have  been wearing this green band to save  Darfur for over a year and a half. But  this band will not save the people of  Darfur, all of my constituents, thousands of my constituents who have  marched throughout the Bay area, who  have come across the country to march  to save Darfur will not save Darfur.  What will save Darfur is the nations of  the world owing up to their responsibility to reject this genocide, to stop  this genocide, to stop this holocaust  against these people and get the government of Sudan to do so.  Of course today we are here to call  upon the nation of China to owe up to  its responsibilities, given its huge influence,  its  economic  influence,  its  military influence, its resource influence in Sudan, to use that influence to  get the government of Sudan to start  to sit down and to negotiate with all of  the parties to end the arms trade that  is taking place, to stop the economic  engagement until such time as these  people in Darfur are once again made  safe, until these people in Darfur are  once again allowed to return to their  villages, to their families and start to  put their lives back together and to  end the genocide. That’s what is necessary to be done.  My colleague Mr. GOODLATTEreferred  to the Olympics. It’s hard to believe  that the world is going to look upon  the host of the Olympics and see there  at the same time a nation that is underwriting a genocide. That  is absolutely on a daily basis by its inaction  and then by its positive actions underwriting and allowing the genocide to go  forward. It’s not that China can stop  this alone, but in concert with the rest  of the nations of the world that have  called out for an end to this genocide,  to take actions against the economic  activity and the military activity in  Sudan.  Congresswoman LEEhas pushed the  effort of divestiture that has been followed up in many States and cities and  universities and other entities. This  has got to continue to stop the genocide that now so many of my colleagues have witnessed  firsthand on  those terrible, terrible visits to Darfur  where we see the worst of humanity  and the violence against these individuals and their families and their children. It has got to stop. I want to  thank my colleagues for bringing this  bipartisan resolution to the  floor to  help us try and end the genocide in  Darfur.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I  have no further requests for time, and  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2007

1257,30,2007-06-05,Ms. LEE.," Let me thank the gentleman once again  for yielding and  ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN,  would like to thank so many of our  young people from around the country  who have been nonstop in their work to  end the genocide. Also, I would like to  thank and recognize and salute the  faith community, because this has been  a movement to save Darfur by young  people in the faith community. I would  just like to mention a few of the organizations that have been unbelievable  and unrelenting in their commitment.  The Save Darfur Coalition, and my colleague from California referred to our  arm bands, Not on Our Watch, Save  Darfur. The Sudan Divestment Task  Force. The American Jewish World  Service. STAND, which is the Student  Anti-Genocide Coalition. Dream  for  Darfur. Genocide  Intervention Network. ENOUGH: The Project to End  Genocide and Mass Atrocities. These  are examples of the type of organizations at the grassroots level that have  been working day and night to help us  here in the House of Representatives  understand our focus and what we need  to do as a country to join hands to end  this horrible massacre that is taking  place.  I just want to once again thank Congresswoman  Chairman LANTOS, Mr. TANNER from  Tennessee and especially once again  Congressman DONPAYNE for beating  the drum, oftentime being a lone voice  in the wilderness, but making sure that  the rest of the world knew that it is incumbent upon the United States Government to lead to end this genocide  and to say again to our country, to the  world, not on our watch will this take  place. And today we are taking one  more step closer to bringing the world  together to ask China to join with us,  as Congressman GEORGEMILLER said,  to stop underwriting this genocide that  is taking place and to come together  now with people and countries of good  conscience who stand together to say  to General Bashir and the Sudanese  government to stop this carnage, to  allow the people of Darfur to return  home to their villages. They want to go  home. They want to go live their lives  and raise their children. We want the  international forces, the U.N. forces, to  go in and to help protect the refugees  and to help the AU forces to make sure  that people are protected until they  can go home. And, of course, finally to  find a long-term political solution.  A month ago we called upon  the  League of Arab Nations to do the same  thing. And so it’s time that the world  stand together and say, no more. It’s  time that we stand together and say to  the people of Darfur that hope is coming and that 450,000 people should not  have been tolerated, but we don’t want  to see another single death occur as a  result. China has got to help us do this.  And so today we are asking the Chinese  government in the spirit of cooperation  to help stop this genocide that is taking place.  ",2007

1260,37,2007-06-05,Mr. BOEHNER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  The resolution, Mr. Speaker, will instruct the Ethics Committee to review  the serious allegations and evidence  against the gentleman from Louisiana  and report back to the House whether  the gentleman should be expelled for  conduct that brings dishonor on this  institution.  This resolution  is not  intended to  cast  innocence or guilt on the gentleman from Louisiana. It is intended  to ensure that the Ethics Committee  process, a process that all the Members  of this House want to see work fairly  and honestly, begin its deliberations of  this issue.  This Ethics Committee  last year,  over  a  period  of  approximately  6  months, was looking into this matter,  but as of today there has not been a  subcommittee established to  look at  the facts of this case. The Republican  pool was announced  several months  ago, and we have been waiting for the  majority party to put their pool members onto the Ethics Committee so, in  fact, this investigation could continue.  And it is somewhat of a sad state that  these members  weren’t  announced  until today and it took the indictment  of Mr. JEFFERSON for the majority to  outline to the House who the members  will be that will make up their pool.  But the point I make is that all of us  have been through a very difficult period in this House, and I think that I  have made clear to my colleagues on  the minority side of the House that I  intend to hold our colleagues to a higher standard. And when we talk about  the standard here, we all know that  bringing honor on  this House  is a  standard that all of us attempt to meet  and make sure that there is no dishonor brought. And we are not talking  here about a standard that is very different from that of a criminal plea or a  criminal  indictment. We are talking  about behavior that brings dishonor on  this institution.  So I believe that the Ethics Committee can, in fact, do its work. I think  they can do it efficiently. And the purpose of this resolution is to ensure that  the House speaks to our Ethics Committee to make sure that it is doing its  job in resolving this case as soon as  possible.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
1261,37,2007-06-05,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I intend to support this  resolution, and I agree with the minority leader. The allegations that have  been made are extraordinarily serious.  They, if proven true, should lead to the  expulsion of the Member in question.  They, of course, have not been proved  true. They are allegations.  Having said that, I also intend to and  have called for a resolution to be considered tonight under suspension. That  resolution speaks not only to the Jefferson case, to which the gentleman  from Ohio limits his privileged resolution, but also speaks to any allegations  of serious criminal conduct that may  be made either through indictment or  other charging documents; and it calls  for action by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in any and all  of those cases.  We appreciate the sensitivity of the  minority leader to this issue at this  time. It is, frankly, the first time I recall such a resolution being offered by  the minority. For over a year, the Ethics Committee essentially didn’t act,  didn’t operate. In fact, when it did and  it held the former majority leader as  having adversely affected the ethics of  the House,  the chairman was  summarily removed from the Committee  on Standards of Official Conduct; and,  in fact, two of the members that had  the temerity to vote to have a consequence for actions that reflected on  the House were  removed  from  that  committee.  But I welcome the minority leader  and the minority party’s interest in  pursuing this matter. I presume that  the gentleman’s resolution will pass  unanimously. I also hope that the suspension resolution will also pass unanimously because there are, of course,  unfortunately, a number of allegations  being made publicly about Members of  this House; and irrespective of what  party they may fall into or be members  of, it is critically important for us to  hold accountable those Members and to  assure the American public that the  Ethics Committee is looking at those  allegations, investigating those allegations, and making reports not only to  the House of Representatives but to  the people.  b1815  We swear an oath to not only defend  the Constitution, but to uphold the  laws of our land. As Members of this  House, we have an absolute obligation  to conduct ourselves in a way that does  not violate the standards of official  conduct or bring  into disrepute the  House of Representatives. Hopefully,  we will agree on that proposition.  So I say to my Republican friends, we  welcome them to this focus on holding  accountable Members who violate the  trust of the American public. We certainly intend to support it. I hope they  will support the subsequently offered  resolution, which says that in every  case we will pursue this focus.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s support of our efforts, and in  support of the Ethics Committee taking up this case and moving as quickly  as possible.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation that the  gentleman refers to has been shown to  us just moments ago. The gentleman,  the majority leader, is well aware that  legislation does not come to the floor  without the cooperation of both sides.  And to have seen this bill just moments ago strikes me as something  that we never, ever, ever would have  considered doing on the floor of the  House without clear consultation and  advisement of the minority. And so, I  will look at the bill. I’m not quite sure  what it says because, again, we have  just received it moments ago.

1264,44,2007-06-05,Mr. MCNERNEY.," Mr. Speaker, the  bribery and corruption charges against  Congressman JEFFERSON are  serious.  They go to the very heart of our ability  as a representative government to do  its job. It is fundamental that the people trust their elected representatives  to act in the people’s interest, not in  their own. The very appearance that  these allegations create is damaging to  the image of this institution.  In  the coming days, Congressman  JEFFERSONwill answer in a court of  law to the 16 charges on which he was  indicted. Congressman JEFFERSON is  entitled to the presumption of innocence in the allegations against him,  including bribery, racketeering, money  laundering and obstruction of justice.  However, the Congress should be held  to the highest standards. Earlier today,  I called for the Ethics Committee to  initiate its own investigation into the  charges against Congressman JEFFERSON.  I support this resolution which calls  for the automatic initiation of an Ethics Committee  investigation when a  Member of this body is indicted or formally charged with criminal conduct.  This principle applies not just to Congressman JEFFERSONbut to any Member of this House.  In the opening days of this Congress,  I rose on the floor in support of a tough  new ethics package.  b1915  I said then that Members of Congress  should be held to the highest regard by  the people they represent. Illegal, unethical or  inappropriate conduct by  Members of the House cannot be tolerated.  I was elected to this Congress to help  change  the way we do business  in  Washington, and I will continue to do  so without regard to person or party.  ",2007

1273,44,2007-06-05,Mr. CARNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the Leader, and I rise in support of this  resolution. Ethics reform must be more  than rhetorical. It simply must be real.  I, like many of my colleagues, came to  Congress with a promise that corruption should not be tolerated from either party. This is not about partisan  politics, but this is rather about upholding strong ethical standards.  I was extremely disappointed to hear  that another Member of Congress was  indicted on such serious charges and  this is not something that we can take  lightly. A Member of Congress under  such  serious  charges  really  should  think long and hard about whether or  not they can remain in Congress.  This  is truly about  justice, about  doing the right things for the Member  of Congress and for the Member of Congress’ constituents.  Should the Member, in fighting these  allegations, think hard about stepping  down? Can the Member truly defend  himself or herself and adequately represent the constituents of his or her  district?  This is something I think that people  under indictment should consider, as  well I would encourage Mr. JEFFERSON  to take this under advisement and encourage him to step down.  I rise in support of this resolution. Ethics Reform must be more than rhetorical—it must be  real. I came to Congress with a promise that  corruption should not be tolerated from either  party. This is not about partisan politics; it is  about upholding strong ethical standards.  I was extremely disappointed  to hear  that  another Member of Congress  is  indicted on  such serious charges and  this  is not something that can be taken lightly. A Member of  Congress under serious  indictment does not  belong  in  the United States House of Representatives.  It is my hope that this situation with Congressman JEFFERSONcan be resolved quickly  and judiciously. However, given the serious allegations and ethical  issues  the  indictment  presents, I call on Congressman JEFFERSON to  resign  from  the U.S. House of Representatives.  ",2007

We need to have the  Ethics Committee take a look at this.  But  I would also  suggest  to  this  House that when someone, anyone, is  under indictment, it’s a difficult position for him to do justice to himself or  herself and to also do justice for their  particular district, and those concerns  were raised by people in New Orleans  today, as well as in the newspaper.  So, as with Mr. CARNEY, I would suggest that the Ethics Committee take a  good long look at this, that Mr. JEFobviously is going to take a  good long look. I would suggest that he  do justice to himself, prepare his defense, and that his district have someone else.  ",2007

Today, with  the Maryland delegation, our distinguished majority leader,  along with ELIJAHCUMMINGS, gave the  eulogy  today  with  both  Senators  present, the Governor of the State, the  mayor of the city, all of the clergy, not  all but a representation of it, and family and  friends of  this great man,  Parren Mitchell.  Many Members of Congress who still  serve here  served with Parren, and  they know he was a champion for economic and social justice.  Mr. Speaker, I want the rest of our  colleagues to know about the Mitchell  family. They were in the forefront of  the civil rights movement; and, as a  native Baltimorean, I knew full well  the quality of their leadership and the  extent of their effectiveness.  Parren Mitchell was a part of that  leadership. He came to the Congress in  1971. He was the first African American  from Maryland to serve in the Congress  and the first African American since  1898  to come  to  the Congress  from  south of the Mason-Dixon line. So he  made history when he came here, and  he was a fighter who made progress  while he was here. He was a pioneer  and patriot. He fought for our country  on the battlefields of Europe. He received the Purple Heart. He fought in  the civil rights movement, and then  fought here on the floor of the Congress until he decided to leave Congress.  It was wonderful to hear his nephew  speak about him, and other representatives of the family speak about him, as  an uncle and a friend and a mentor.  It was wonderful to hear the clergy  speak of him as a child of the church,  a truly religious person who brought  his religion and his faith into public  service.  It was wonderful to hear the elected  officials sing his praises as ones who  had learned from him, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator CARDIN. They had learned  from him and worked with him. Again,  he was a champion for many issues.  He was a  founder of the Congressional Black Caucus, and I am so happy  that he lived to see five members of the  Congressional Black Caucus  become  chairs of the  full committee  in the  House. We have Chairman RANGEL, who  will be making our economy fairer and  all of the economic justice that Mr.  Mitchell talked about; and Chairman  CONYERS, who did speak today about  bringing  the  civil  rights movement  into our Congress, into our legislation,  protecting and defending our Constitution and our civil liberties.  So it was a happy occasion, although  he will be greatly missed. It was a celebration of his life that was enjoyed for  many hours today in St. James Episcopal Church in Baltimore, Maryland.  Congressman SARBANES was  there,  along with his full family, his mother  and father, former Senator Paul Sarbanes, his brother, Michael, and of  course a Member of Congress we are  very proud of, JOHNSARBANES.  And ALWYNNwas there. We almost  had all of the Maryland delegation, the  Democrats, that is. And the delegation  is almost all Democratic, but that is  for another discussion on another day.  ALWYNNwas there representing the  area nearest Washington, DC, but close  to the service of Parren Mitchell.  When I spoke at the service I said we  would be gathering here  tonight  to  talk about Parren Mitchell and his  wonderful contribution to our country  and that they should tune in. But I  wanted to tell you tonight what we saw  today, which was a community who  truly  respected  this great man and  truly loved him and who will miss him  sorely.  With the passing of Parren Mitchell, our Nation has lost one of its most passionate champions of justice and equality. I offer my deepest condolences on behalf of all of my colleagues in the House to Congressman Mitchell’s family, friends, and all who loved him.  Growing up in Baltimore, I learned to revere  the Mitchell family for their dedication to economic and social justice. Parren, his brother  Clarence, and  indeed his entire  family, devoted their lives to ending racism and ensuring  that our Nation’s bounty was shared by all of  its citizens. For  that, we have all benefited.  That  is because  their advocacy brought us  closer  to  the  ideal of equality  that  is both  America’s heritage and our hope.  The story of Parren Mitchell’s life tracks the  progress we’ve made. But it also shows how  much farther we must travel to truly achieve  justice for all.  At age 11, Parren Mitchell understood the  reality of racism at its most violent and brutal.  His older brother, Clarence, a true champion  of social justice in his own right, came home  one day and told of having just seen the body  of a man who had been murdered—lynched—  in Somerset County.  In  that moment, Congressman Mitchell would later say, he decided  to dedicate his entire  life  to  fighting  for  the  rights of African Americans.  Years later, in 1950, after graduating from  Morgan State, the University of Maryland refused  to admit Congressman Mitchell  to  its  College Park campus, telling him that it was  ‘‘inadvisable’’ for blacks to attend. But that injustice would not prevent Parren Mitchell from  pursuing his dream. He fought back. He won  his court case. And Parren Mitchell became  the first African-American graduate student at  the College Park campus, and earned his  master’s degree in sociology. Because Parren  Mitchell refused to see his dream of attending  graduate school denied, many more were able  to pursue their own dream of a graduate education.  Then,  in 1971, when  first sworn  in as a  Member of the House, Congressman Mitchell  became the first African-American Member of  Congress elected from the State of Maryland.  This achievement must have been tempered  by the knowledge that he was the very first African-American  elected  to Congress  from  below  the Mason-Dixon  line since 1898.  It  took almost a century  for a Black American  from the South to find a seat here in the People’s House.  Across  the 85 years of Parren Mitchell’s  life—in his own story and the story of America—we see the slow march of progress. We  celebrate today a man who made sure that,  however slow at times, we continue to march  in  the  right direction—toward peace, understanding, and justice for all.  Congressman CUMMINGS recently described  Mr. Mitchell as  ‘‘never  concerning himself  about  fame or  fortune but,  rather, devoting  himself entirely to uplifting the people he represented.’’ That was apparent  through his  leadership as  the  first African American  to  chair  the House Small Business Committee.  There, he put into law guarantees that minority-owned  business would  share  in  public  works and transportation contracts.  It is also a great testament to the leadership  of Parren Mitchell  that  the organization he  helped found—the Congressional Black Caucus—continues to serve as the conscience of  the Congress and  increase  its ranks  to  the  benefit of all Americans. I am sure Mr. Mitchell  is looking down upon us today and that he is  pleased that so many CBC members are here  to honor him today.  With Congressman Mitchell’s passing, we  have lost a friend, a former colleague, and a  passionate advocate for seeing that America’s  promise of freedom and equality are realized  by all of our citizens. Whether  in  the Army,  where he earned a Purple Heart, teaching at  his alma mater, Morgan State, or serving his  community as a social worker or a member of  this body, Parren Mitchell dedicated his life to  service. His loss leaves a void that we must  work together to fill.  I hope  it  is a comfort  to Congressman  Mitchell’s family and friends that so many people mourn their loss and are praying for them  at this sad time.  f  REMEMBERING PARREN J.  MITCHELL  ",2007

1284,51,2007-06-05,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, as a young  man I worked on Capitol Hill  for a  United States Senator, along with the  Speaker, Senator Daniel Brewster.  From time to time, Clarence Mitchell, Jr., one of the giants of American  history  in  civil  rights  in America,  would visit Senator Brewster; and I  would have an opportunity to meet  him. I was honored and awed to meet  him. Many called him the 101st United  States Senator. Clarence Mitchell, Jr.,  was  the  brother  of Parren  James  Mitchell.  Shortly after I graduated from law  school, I was honored by the citizens of  my district who elected me  to  the  State Senate. I went to the State Senate as a young man, but there was a  young man 6 months younger than I.  His name was Clarence Mitchell, III,  Clarence Junior’s son. We served together.

1363,86,2007-06-05,Mr. CRAIGTHOMAS.,"  I want to say to Senator ENZI, first,  we will all have an opportunity in the  next  few days and weeks  to  speak  about the Senator who was your colleague who left us last night, and we  all will have an opportunity to speak  with you and see you on more occasions than this to express to you our  heartfelt sorrow for the loss of your  colleague.  You will suffer a lot of things that  will be downers during your life in the  Senate—and because we all  live our  lives,  things happen, go up and go  down—but I am quite sure you will not  have an opportunity to suffer any more  severe a loss than the loss of your colleague who was at the same time a  cowboy, a marine, a Senator, a father,  and, clearly, a husband.  He had a wife named Susan. Everybody who knows her loves her. My wife  loves her. I called my wife early this  morning, after I heard, and I was so  pleased she answered the phone herself  because I thought: Where will I get  her? We may get caught up in the maze  of today and maybe I will not be able  to  talk  to her until  tomorrow, or  maybe Nancy will not be able to talk  to me. But, sure enough, it was at 8:30  this morning I was able to talk to her.  Her first words, after knowing who I  was, were words coming out of her  mouth saying: He did a good job for  Wyoming, didn’t he? I said: You bet.  Then: I am sure, not knowing the rest  of his life, he must have done a good  job in a lot of other areas. Probably he  was a good husband—to which there  was no answer because that was not intended as a question. He obviously was  a wonderful man. Quiet, sort of unassuming, but he was a very  involved  Senator, especially when  it came to  Wyoming.  Very early on, as he worked his way  from the House, where he replaced DICK  CHENEY, over to the Senate, where he  had been elected, he decided he would  work for his State. You did not hear of  him a lot on national news because he  was busy doing what he thought was  best for him as a Senator, and that  was, representing that great State of  Wyoming. What a State that is, and  what a Senator they had.  From my standpoint, I served with  him on two committees. The one  I  know the most and remember the most  is the one we served the longest on: Energy and Natural Resources, which the  occupant of the chair has served on  with us. But when it came to this man,  he frequently worked with Democrats  on serious issues because he wanted to  get things done.  If there is one thing I noticed as we  worked together, shoulder to shoulder  on this committee, it was that he was  impatient because he did not understand when we wasted time and he did  not understand why we were doing  some certain things. He would ask:  Why don’t we get on with what we are  supposed to do? What are we talking  about this for? This is not policy. We  are talking about a bunch of  little  things we ought not be involved in. I  think I remember that more than anything else: Can’t we get on with it?  I remember he was burdened with the  fact there is a substance in his State  called trona. The other Senator from  Wyoming might know about  it. He  must know about it. Apparently, they  were having competition in the world,  and he thought the royalties were too  high.  I  don’t know. Anybody who  served on the committee must have  heard the word ‘‘trona’’ because he was  all over that  issue, wanting to get  somebody to listen to him about the  unfairness of it and to help solve it.  I did not get to serve with him on the  Finance Committee and other committees he served on, but it would be my  guess he was the same way on all of  them,  that he  showed up when he  should and did his job as best he could,  and that when the chips were down,  you could count on him. When the  chips were down, he did what he said.  He voted the way he would tell you. He  worked  the way a dedicated person  works.  For me and my wife, on this day,  shortly after his death, I want to say in  the Senate that Wyoming sent us a  true man. I do not know whether it was  the marines who made him a man or  what it was, but he was truly different.  He was tough minded. He was quiet.  But he was impatient, and he wanted  to get good things done.  I am positive his relatives and his  great State will never forget him. He  will be remembered by them, just as we  remember him. He will leave them, and  they will have a big void, without a  question, because a giant part of their  lives leaves. That goes for Wyoming,  and that goes for his wife Susan and  their children. I think there are four of  them. I did not get to meet them. But  if they are like their mother and father, they could not help but be great.  With that, I say goodbye to the Senator, and I extend my sorrows to his  wonderful wife, and, hopefully, I will be  part of whatever ceremony there is for  us to send him on his way.  May God bless his family and him,  and may whatever he aspired to get  done, get done by others who follow  him because he set such a wonderful  basis to get those things completed for  his State.  I thank the Senate and I thank the  junior Senator from Wyoming for the  kind man he is. I will be seeing him,  and I say to the Senator, if I can help  you during these times, please call on  me. I am available.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.  ",2007
1364,86,2007-06-05,Mr. LUGAR.," Madam President, the  thoughts  and  prayers  of my wife  Charlene and myself are with Susan  today and their four children, as we  think about CRAIGTHOMAS, our dear  friend, our colleague, a man who has  been such a wonderful presence in our  lives in the Senate.  Much has been said, and quite correctly so, about Senator THOMASas a  cowboy, and certainly he was, and his  rich heritage of experience in the Marine Corps, as he volunteered to serve  his country after college. But I want to  stress two or three things that perhaps  have not come to the attention of Senators in the same way this morning,  one of which is that CRAIGTHOMASwas  a person who was vitally interested in  the Far East. He served for a period of  time on the Foreign Relations Committee, and during that period of time,  as  I  recall,  was  either  the  subcommittee  chairman or heavily  involved in hearings and in working with  our Ambassadors to countries in Asia.

1365,93,2007-06-05,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Texas.  ,2007
1366,93,2007-06-05,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Madam President,  we did not think, coming back to the  Chamber a week after we had all gone  our separate ways back to our States,  that we would come back with one of  our Members not here. There is a drape  over CRAIGTHOMAS’s chair and a beautiful flower arrangement.  But all of us who go through the day-  to-day workings of the Senate, working  with our constituents at home, the  pressures which we all know we feel  being 24/7 in a job that we love, but we  all know the stresses and strains and  therefore we bond because of the similarity of experience. So when we all  said goodbye at the end of last week,  we did not expect to come back and  have one fewer Member. So I want to  rise today to express my sadness for  the passing of Senator CRAIGTHOMAS  and to express my deepest sympathy  for his wife Susan, their family, and  the people of Wyoming.  Senator THOMAS served in Congress  for 18 years, 6 years in the House and 12  years in the Senate. He had just been  reelected to his third term. But his  service to the United States did not  begin when he came to the nation’s  capital. It began in the Marine Corps,  where he served from 1955 to 1959. Then  he went back to Wyoming to work at  the Wyoming Farm Bureau and then  the Rural Electric Association. Later,  he began a career  in public service,  winning an election to the Wyoming  House of Representatives. Five years  later he won a special election to succeed then-Congressman DICKCHENEYas  a Member of the U.S. House, and 5  years after that in 1994, then-Congressman THOMASwon election to the Senate.  CRAIGTHOMASused his real-life, rural  background  to  champion a positive  agenda for America’s rural community.  As a former chairman of the National  Parks Subcommittee, CRAIG authored legislation to provide funding  and management reforms to protect  America’s national parks in the 21st  century.  He was honored  by  the National  Parks and Conservation Association  with their William Penn Mott, Jr. Park  Leadership Award. As a senior member  of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator THOMASwas instrumental in vital  issues such as Social Security, trade,  and tax reform. He was co-chair of the  Senate Rural Health Caucus.  These  are  impressive  accomplishments, but Senator CRAIGTHOMAS, the  THOMAS  man, was  just as  impressive. Every  time I called CRAIG to fill in for me  when I was vice chairman of the Republican Conference, he was there. He  was on the executive committee as the  vice chairman of the conference. CRAIG  was the one I turned to the most to  chair a meeting if I could not be there.  He would  talk on  the Senate  floor  about the specific issues that we were  wanting to focus on at the time.  He was so well liked by everyone in  this Chamber. I cannot imagine anyone  ever saying they did not like CRAIG  THOMAS. His wife Susan is a very special lady as well. She works with children who have disabilities. She has  made that her life-long mission. She is  so loved and respected in the teaching  community for the great work that she  has done.  So when all of us learned about CRAIG  THOMAS’s illness late last year, we all  thought: Gosh, he  is going to be a  fighter. He is going to do so well. And  he did. He did do well. He fought it  with  immediate  chemotherapy.  He  came back with less hair than he started with in the month of November, but  we knew, as we were watching him  progress, that he was looking better  and better and his color was getting  better and better. Then when we all  left last week, some knew he was going  back for another round of chemo. Many  of us did not know. But no one in our  body realized how serious it was.  Yesterday, God did call him home. At  the moment that he was called, his  wife Susan; his sons, Patrick and Greg;  and his daughter, Lexie, were all there  with him. So our prayers shift now  from recovery to comfort, and we hope  his family knows and the people of Wyoming know what a mark he made on  this body. He will be remembered, and  he certainly is where the angels are because of his good nature and his good  deeds. We wish Susan and the family  our condolences and our best wishes,  and we hope all of us will be able to  have the good memories when time begins to heal.  I yield the floor.  ",2007

1372,100,2007-06-05,Mr.  SPECTER.," Mr.  President,  I  thank the Senator from Colorado for  his amendment and for his analysis. I  understand the reasoning and the point  behind what he is seeking to do.  The preference, which is contained in  the proposed  legislation, was  structured  in  an  elaborate  arrangement  with what has been accurately called  the very fractional coalition. In order  to get certain other concessions in the  bill, it was deemed necessary to give  this  preference  to  the  agricultural  workers. You can justifiably raise an  issue as to why give a preference to agricultural workers, and the answer, although not very satisfactory,  is because it is part of an interwoven accommodation on many provisions of  the bill. That is why, as one of the  managers of the bill, I am constrained  to object and to urge my colleagues to  vote against the amendment.  ",2007
1373,100,2007-06-05,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr. President, I understand and appreciate the ranking member’s position on this particular piece  of legislation. This part of the bill is  not well drafted, and I hope we can get  this amendment passed and then send a  message to the conference committee  that this part of the bill needs to be  worked on so that we don’t allow people who are here illegally an opportunity to step ahead of those citizens  who have come here legally. If we can  adopt my amendment, then I think the  will of  the Senate gets clearly expressed to the conference committee,  and hopefully the problem with the  drafting that has occurred with this  section of the bill can be straightened  out and preserve the compromise that  the ranking Republican from Pennsylvania is striving to hold on to.  ",2007
1374,100,2007-06-05,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, on the  issue as to the contention by the Senator from Colorado that they are moving ahead of people who are here legally, factually I believe that is not so.  The bill is structured to clear up the  backlog of all of those people who are  waiting now, and they will have their  status resolved in an 8-year period—  those who are following the procedures  which are legal at the present time.  It is after that occurs that the 12 million undocumented  immigrants will  come in, and then there will be points  OFFICER. Who  preference for those among the illegals  who are here, who are the farm workers. I do not believe we are putting  anybody who is here illegally ahead of  those who are here legally.  ",2007

1377,100,2007-06-05,Mr. ALLARD.," This is where the issue  comes up. It is not exactly clear in this  paragraph where  it provides  supplemental points for citizenship, or when  in time it begins to apply. If it gets applied in one way in the bill, then the  argument my colleagues make is probably valid. But if it gets put in another  place in the bill, my arguments apply.  This is where we have a drafting problem within the bill.  My hope is that with the adoption of  my amendment we will call this to the  attention of the conference committee,  and this can be rectified when we go to  conference.  The  PRESIDING  yields time?  The Senator from Massachusetts is  recognized.  ",2007
1378,100,2007-06-05,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, this is  the seventh day that we have been on  this legislation. We voted on 17 amendments. There are 13 others pending to  the bill. We will be voting on those  very soon.  Over the past week, as the Senate  has been in recess for Memorial Day,  we witnessed a healthy debate across  the country as Americans across the  political spectrum have expressed their  views on this legislation. Some support  our legislation, others oppose it. With  all of the editorials and newspaper articles and phone calls from the constituents,  one  theme  occurs  loud  and  strong: Americans know our immigration system is broken and they want us  to fix it. This week we have a chance to  meet that challenge for the good of the  Nation.  We have a bipartisan bill before us. It  has the support of the President. I believe when we complete the debate in  the Senate we will adopt it. It enforces  our borders;  it cracks down  in  the  workplace by going after employers  who hire illegal workers; it brings the  12 million families who are here out of  the shadows; it speeds up the reunion  of families waiting legally in line who  otherwise may never make it here; it  sets up an immigration for the future  that  continues  to  reunite  families,  while stressing our Nation’s economic  needs. That  is  our  program.  It  is  strong, practical, and it is fair.  I know the Senator from Illinois is  looking to address the Senate. First, I  want to speak briefly on the Allard  amendment.  The Allard  amendment  seeks  to  strike a blow at one of the central pillars of comprehensive immigration reform, which is the earned legalization  program for undocumented people who  are working and contributing in the  United States.

1380,107,2007-06-05,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, my counterpart, the distinguished Senator from  Kentucky, said this is a 2-week bill,  and we are in the second week of this  bill.  I will also state—and I am not as  much of a poll watcher as my caucus  would tell me I should be—that the  polls also show the Republican Members  of Congress  are  not  as well  thought of as Democratic Members of  Congress.  As far as success, I think we have  done pretty well this past 6 months. We  now have a bill that has been signed by  the President where, for the first time  in 10 years, we give a raise to the people who need it worst, the people who  rely on the minimum wage. Keep in  mind that 60 percent of those who draw  a minimum wage are women. For the  vast majority of those women, that is  the only money they have for themselves and their families.  We have tried for 3 years to get disaster assistance  for  farmers, and we  were able to get that. That  is now  signed  into  law. The President has  made many trips to the gulf, but in  this supplemental bill, which we forced  the President to sign, we now have  monetary relief for people in the gulf  affected by Katrina.  We were able to extend the SCHIP  program  for  children’s health  care.  That is a significant accomplishment.  That will take care of things until October. We were also—in the legislation  that  the President  signed,  that we  forced—able to get more than he gave  us in the supplemental appropriations  bill. We had more money for the troops  in  Iraq  and Afghanistan—$4  billion  more for medicine and veterans’ benefits.  We have been trying for years to get  money for homeland security. In this  bill, we got  it, a billion dollars  for  homeland security that has long been  necessary.  Within the next week or two, we are  going to have a conference report that  will  come  forward,  sending  to  the  President legislation on stem cell research that will give hope to millions.  I worked, in fact, as late as yesterday  with  the  distinguished  Republican  leader, and I think we are in a position  where we can come up with a satisfactory conference report on ethics and  lobbying reform.  So I think we should not be denigrating the work of this Congress and  the things we have been able to accomplish, which has been done on a bipartisan basis. We have had to push and  pull a little, getting motions to proceed on various pieces of legislation  that were necessary, but we were able  to do that. So I don’t think it is time  to denigrate or belittle the Congress  based on the polls we have seen.  I repeat,  let us not get  into poll  watching, because if you look at the  polls, Democratic Congressmen, Democrats generally, are scored much higher  than Republicans. But I repeat, I don’t  follow polls. I think we should be doing  a lot more by what we feel is right to  do than what polls show.  I hope the immigration matter can  move along. I think the two leaders of  the Senate have stated how we  feel  about this, and now we turn it over to  the good hands of our experienced managers.  ",2007

So far on this  bill we have had nine rollcall votes. By  any objective  standard  that  is not  nearly enough. Let us proceed to work  on the bill, and, hopefully, we can get  somewhere during the course of the  week.  I yield the floor.  ",2007

1384,107,2007-06-05,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President, I  tried to offer an amendment on May 24,  before the week’s recess, and I was  asked by Senator KENNEDY if I would  withhold and he would make every effort to allow me to have a vote on my  amendment on Social Security for Z  visa holders on the  first day back,  which is today.  Now, I know there have been intervening circumstances, and I am not  saying there is any blame here. However, I am asking that we set a time for  the vote on my amendment No. 1302,  which has been filed but which I was  asked to withhold offering. Now I wish  to have a time certain,  if possible,  where we can have a vote on that  amendment.  I have to say I have now seen this  body operate. What happens on a bill  such as this, that is very complicated  and long, and especially when you are  writing the bill on the  floor rather  than taking it through the committee  process, there are a lot of amendments  which are legitimate amendments, yet  the distinguished majority leader said  he was going to file cloture on the bill  tonight. That would ripen on Thursday.  I have three amendments. One is on  Social Security protection for America, from any person who works illegally to get credit on Social Security  when they are working illegally; another one on the future flow of Y visa  holders; and then I have an amendment  for people to return home before they  come back and become  legal guest  workers in our country. So those are  three amendments I am giving everyone notice I believe are very important,  they are productive,  they are  positive, and  they are an effort  to  make this a bill that Americans will  see is the right approach to handling  the chaos we have with illegal immigration in our country. I don’t want to  be squeezed out by cloture or by time  deadlines.  If we take 4 weeks on this bill and it  becomes a better bill that all of us can  support, those who wish to have comprehensive reform, 4 weeks, with the  effect this is going to have in the next  25 years for our country, that is nothing. So I hope I will be able to offer my  three amendments and get votes on  them at some point.  I want to be able to protect my  rights, and I want to ask if I could have  a time certain to vote on the first Social Security amendment, No. 1302, if  that would be possible.  ",2007

We have a few on our  side. It is at least worth a try to see if  we can come up with a list of germane  amendments. I ask Senator KENNEDY  and Senator SPECTERto see if they can  come up with a list of germane amendments that Members think they want  to vote on. We already have, as I said,  12 or so pending, and we will take a  look at that. I am not even sure the 12  pending are germane. We don’t know  that either.

1397,121,2007-06-05,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I urge  my colleagues to support amendment  No. 1176. This amendment contains the  language of S. 621, the Wartime Treatment Study Act, a bipartisan bill I  have introduced with my friend from  Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY.  This amendment would create two  fact-finding commissions: one commission to review the U.S. Government’s  treatment  of  German  Americans,  Italian Americans, and European Latin  Americans during World War II, and  another commission to review the U.S.  Government’s treatment of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution during  World War II. This amendment would  help us to learn more about how recent  immigrants and refugees were treated  during World War II.  The United States fought a courageous battle against the spread of Nazism and fascism. But we should not let  justifiable pride  in our Nation’s triumph in World War II blind us to the  treatment of some Americans by their  own government.  Many Americans are aware that during World War II, under the authority  of Executive Order 9066 and the Alien  Enemies Act,  the U.S. Government  forced more than 100,000 ethnic Japanese from their homes and into relocation and internment camps. Through  the work of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians created by Congress in 1980, this  unfortunate episode in our history finally received the official acknowledgment and condemnation it deserved.  But that same respect has not been  shown to the many German Americans,  Italian Americans, and European Latin  Americans who were taken from their  homes, subjected to curfews, limited in  their travel, deprived of their personal  property,  and,  in  the worst  cases,  placed  in  internment  camps.  This  amendment would  simply  create  a  commission to review the facts and circumstances of the U.S. Government’s  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:40 Jun 06, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G05JN6.075 S05JNPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007
1398,163,2007-06-05,Mr. GALLEGLY.," Madam Speaker, I rise in  memory of my friend Ralph Bering Busch, Jr.,  MD, who passed away on May 23 at age 84.  Dr. Busch was a medical pioneer in Ventura  County, California.  In  the 1960s, Dr. Busch  and his partner, M. Kathleen Belton, MD, became the first anesthesiologists to practice in  Ventura County. They covered St. John’s Hospital  in Oxnard, Santa Paula Memorial Hospital, Community Memorial Hospital  in Ventura, and occasionally Ojai Valley Community  Hospital. Dr. Busch served at Santa Paula  Memorial Hospital for twenty years and retired  from Community Memorial Hospital in 1989.  Dr. Busch came to California after serving in  the South Pacific with the U.S. Navy for four  years, after graduating from high school, college, and medical school in the Midwest. He  interned at University of Southern California,  Los Angeles County Hospital and then practiced at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Burbank for  the next ten years.  In 1959, he married Deborah  ‘‘Deedee’’  Bennett of Palm Springs. As their family grew,  they decided to seek the country life of Ventura County. It was a good choice for them  and  for Ventura County. Ralph and Deedee  have been blessed with six children and eighteen grandchildren.  In addition to his dedication to his practice  and his family, Dr. Busch dedicated himself to  the greater medical community and the community in which he lived. He was a past member of the California and American Societies of  Anesthesiology, Ventura County Medical Society, Community Memorial Hospital Board of  Directors, Ventura County Museum of History  and Art Board of Directors, and Berry Petroleum Co. Board of Directors. He was a forty-  five-year member of Saticoy Country Club.  Madam Speaker, I know my colleagues will  join me  in  remembering Dr. Ralph Bering  Busch, Jr., as a good friend, a loving family  man, a pioneer in Ventura County medicine,  and one who worked to make his community  stronger.  In addition,  I know my colleagues  join me  in  extending  our  condolences  to  Deedee and their family and to all who called  Ralph a friend.  Godspeed, Ralph.  f  TRIBUTE TO MR. ROBERT M.

1399,163,2007-06-05,Mrs. CAPITO.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor the passing of a great patriot, public  citizen, and revered member of his community, Mr. Robert M. Steptoe.  Born  in Clarksburg, West Virginia on May  15, 1920, Mr. Steptoe grew up in north central  West Virginia and  thereafter attended Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He  continued his studies at Haverford College in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Shepherd College in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.  At the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Steptoe  served in the United States Navy as the commanding officer of two ships in the sub-chaser  class. Mr. Steptoe was involved in the invasions of Sicily, Anzio, southern France, and a  brief stint in the Southern Pacific. He retired  from the United States Navy with the rank of  lieutenant commander.  Following his service during World War II,  Mr. Steptoe graduated from the University of  Virginia School of Law in February 1949 and  began a career in law that spanned over 50  years of distinguished  legal practice  in Martinsburg, West Virginia. A member of the West  Virginia State Bar, the West Virginia Bar Association, the Berkeley County Bar Association,  and the United States Judicial Conference for  the Fourth Circuit; Mr. Steptoe was awarded  the Award of Merit by the West Virginia Bar  Association in 2003 in recognition of his years  of service.  Mr. Steptoe was also an active public servant who was elected  to  the West Virginia  House of Delegates  for  four  terms and  the  West Virginia Senate for two terms. He also  served as a judge of the West Virginia Court  of Claims.  In addition to his professional activities, Mr.  Steptoe was an active member of the Rotary,  Trinity Episcopal Church, and a member of the  Elks Club. Above all, Mr. Steptoe was a proud  and dedicated husband,  father, grandfather,  and great-grandfather.  Mr. Steptoe’s life and accomplishments are  truly representative of the courage, character  and altruism  that  is often associated with  members of our ‘‘Greatest Generation.’’ West  Virginia was well served by this great American and he will be sorely missed by  those  who knew him.  f  TRIBUTE TO EDWARD L.

1400,163,2007-06-05,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," Madam Speaker,  in the Fourth Congressional District of Georgia, many schools strive to excel in competition on the national level.  Ten years ago, the DeKalb County School  system gave birth to Edward L. Bouie, Sr. Elementary School and named this extraordinary  school for an extraordinary man.  For 10 years now under the leadership and  guidance of the past and present principals,  teachers, staff, parents, and students,  this  school has met and exceeded national standards.  The  Edward  L.  Bouie,  Sr.  Elementary  School family constantly demonstrates the will  to win, the courage to win, the mechanics of  teamwork and the astounding spirit of triumph  gained from educating students to be the very  best in leadership, scholarship, and service.  Our beloved county, children, and community will benefit from the fruits of that labor insuring that our district, our state and our nation will always be prosperous and productive.  This extraordinary school is celebrating the  milestone of their 10th anniversary and I was  pleased to proclaim May 18, 2007 as Edward  L. Bouie, Sr. Elementary School Day  in  the  4th Congressional District.  f  RECOGNIZING  COLBY  JOHN  BUEHLER FOR ACHIEVING THE  RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT  HON.

Colby has been very active with his troop,  participating in many scout activities.

1402,170,2007-06-05,Mr. ORTIZ.," Madam Speaker, I rise to pay  tribute to Major Andrew Weatherstone on the  occasion of his promotion to Lieutenant Colonel on June 1, 2007. Andy is an Army Fellow  in my Congressional office this year, and he is  an extraordinary soldier and human being.  He is a great leader, a motivator of men and  women in his command, a seeker of creative  solutions . . . an officer uniquely suited to the  United States Army at a moment we need all  the great soldiers and officers we can get.  We were  lucky  to get Andy  this year; his  last assignment was in Iraq. So my team and  I have had the benefit of his counsel at a pivotal moment in our history, as we seek solutions to the ongoing conflict in Iraq and the  many readiness issues Iraq has highlighted.  A graduate of the University of Tennessee,  with a Masters from the University of Central  Michigan, Andy is a soldier’s soldier. He came  up  through  the ranks, starting as a platoon  leader and battery officer in 1993, to operating  a 1,200 strong Task Force and a Forward Operating Base in Taji, Iraq, in 2004.  Andy understands the needs of a battlefield  soldier;  and  he  understands  the  political  machinations that surround the conduct of our  military policy. He may not be patient with  that, but few of us are these days.  He understands  that democracy must be  defended;  and  he  knows  that  democracy  means involving everybody and all opinions in  determining policy.  He knows that freedom is not free, and in  wearing the uniform of the United States he is  one of those paying the price for all our freedoms on battlefields around the world.  Andy’s story would not be complete without  including his wife, Jennifer, his ‘‘champ,’’ and  their daughters Lauren and Elizabeth. Andy  got to be home when Elizabeth was born this  year.  For all that he has learned in the field, in  combat, in training, and in teaching other soldiers . . . LTC Andy Weatherstone will be a  remarkable leader in the U.S. Army.  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Andy—and his family—on the occasion  of his promotion to Lieutenant Colonel.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

Mr. Venable had two passions—farming and  public  service. He  served on  the Lincoln  County Quorum Court for 24 years and was a  member  of  the Grady City Council. Mr.  Venable was a retired farmer recognized as  an accomplished agriculturist who won multiple awards at the Arkansas State Fair and  was a past recipient of the Farm Family of the  Year Award.  Mr. Venable spent a lifetime giving back to  his community and his dedication and numerous contributions to agriculture will never be  forgotten. Anyone who ever knew him will always remember his smile and good-natured  spirit as he always made time for anyone who  wanted to talk.  Perhaps most important was Mr. Venable’s  gracious nature which he bestowed upon his  fellow man, something that was deep-seated  in his strong faith. He was an active, lifelong  member of the First Baptist Church of Grady  where he served as a Deacon. In addition, his  humble  influence and natural ability  to  lead  was evident in all he did. He was a charter  member and past President of  the Grady  Lion’s Club, a member of  the Long Lake  Drainage Board, the Lincoln County Farm Bureau, and the Big Island Hunting Club.  My deepest condolences go to his beloved  wife of 59 years, Charlene Venable of Grady;  his  two daughters, Sondra Ashcroft of Pine  Bluff and Billie  Issacs of Grady; his  three  grandchildren Lee Drake of Star City, Christian  Ashcraft of Pine Bluff and Britten Ashcraft of  Pine Bluff; and  to his  three brothers Clyde  Venable of Grady, Leonard Venable of Little  Rock, and Robert Venable of Grady. Harold  Venable will be greatly missed in Grady, Lincoln County, and throughout the state of Arkansas.  f  PROVIDING  FOR  CONSIDERATION  OF H.R. 2317, LOBBYING TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF  H.R.  2316, HONEST LEADERSHIP  AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF  2007  SPEECHOF  HON.

Madam Speaker, today we stand on the verge of passing  two pieces of  lobby  reform  legislation  that  mark an important step toward greater transparency and accountability for Congress. This  is a welcome and much-needed response to  the growing dissatisfaction of  the American  people, who do not approve of the increasing  role and influence that special interests have  on our democracy. There is, however, much  more that Congress must do.  In the November 2008 election, the American people made it clear that the corruption  that has been seeping into government cannot  be tolerated. It is now the task of Congress to  raise the standards of ethics in lobbying and  campaign finance in order to meet the expectations of the public. We must take action now  to remove the grip that private money has on  our democracy. I urge my colleagues to support these lobbying reform measures on the  floor  today, but believe our work  is not yet  done.

1405,3,2007-06-11,Mr. LATOURETTE.," Madam Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, today we recognize  the 50th anniversary of Lake Sidney  Lanier, an Army Corps of Engineers facility located in the State of Georgia.  Lake Lanier is one of 464 lakes in 43  States constructed and operated by the  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Our Nation is blessed with considerable water resources that support our  Nation’s economy and quality of life.  We need water for our homes, farms  and  factories. Water  also  supports  navigation, generates power and sustains our environment.  Congress authorized the Buford Dam  Project in 1946 just after the end of the  Second World War. Groundbreaking for  the project began in 1950. Constructed  by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  Lake Lanier is a multipurpose, 38,000-  acre lake that provides flood protection, power production, water supply,  navigation,  recreation, and  fish and  wildlife management.  Nestled in the foothills of the Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains, Lake Sidney  Lanier  is one of America’s  favorite  lakes. Over 7.5 million people a year  choose to visit Lake Lanier. With over  692 miles of shoreline, the lake is well  known for its aqua-blue colored water,  spectacular scenery and variety of recreational activities.  When completed, the total cost of  construction,  including  land acquisition, was almost $45 million. When the  gates of the dam were closed in 1956, it  took more than 3 years for the lake to  reach its normal elevation of 1,070 feet  above sea level.  The lake is named for one of the Nation’s most famous poets, Sidney Lanier. Born in Georgia in 1842, Mr. Lanier entered Oglethorpe College at 14  years of age, graduating at the top of  his class in 1860.  While serving on the blockade runner  ‘‘Lucy’’ during the Civil War, Mr. Lanier was captured and contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned in Maryland. Following the Civil War, Mr. Lanier played the flute for the Peabody  Symphony and lectured at Johns Hopkins University.  While he  is known  for works  like  ‘‘The Harlequin of Dreams,’’  ‘‘In Absence,’’  ‘‘Acknowledgement,’’  and  ‘‘Sunrise,’’ he is best remembered for  ‘‘The Song of the Chattahoochee,’’ an  enduring legacy for the native Georgian.  I urge all of our Members to support  this legislation.  ",2007
1406,3,2007-06-11,Mr. OBERSTAR.," Madam Speaker, I rise in  support of H. Res. 354, recognizing the year  2007 as the official 50th anniversary celebration of the beginnings of marinas, power production, recreation, and boating on Lake Sidney Lanier, Georgia.  Lake Lanier is named after Sidney Clopton  Lanier, a poet and musician who was born in  Macon, Georgia, in 1842. After participating in  battle during the Civil War, and being captured  and  imprisoned  in Point Lookout, Maryland,  Mr.  Lanier  contracted  tuberculosis, which  would affect him for the rest of his life.  Mr. Lanier’s life was one of practicality and  beauty: while he practiced law to support his  wife and four children, he was also the first  flutist in the Peabody Orchestra in Baltimore,  Maryland, and an accomplished poet. The  Lake was named after Mr. Lanier because of  the way he positively portrayed the Chattahoochee River in his poetry.  In fact, Lake Lanier itself is a symbol of both  practicality and beauty.  It provides  crucial  flood control, protecting approximately $2 billion worth of property in the surrounding area.  Similarly, on June 16, 1957—50 years ago  this week—Buford Dam  began  producing  power for the first time. Hydropower continues  to flow from these waters to this day.  Although the lake is one of 464 lakes constructed and operated by the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers, it has won the annual award for  ‘‘best operated lake’’ for three separate years:  1990, 1997, and 2002.  While  the  flood control, water supply, and  power production role of Lake Lanier may be  critical to the continuing livelihood of the communities in the surrounding area, the lake also  provides beautiful scenery and  recreational  opportunities  that  local citizens and visiting  tourists enjoy. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates  that more  than 7.5 million  people visit  the 692 miles of  lake shoreline  each year.  I urge my colleagues to join with me in recognizing the 50th anniversary of Lake Lanier.  ",2007

Virginia  legalizing interracial marriage within  the United States.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 431  Whereas the first anti-miscegenation law  in the United States was enacted in Maryland in 1661;  Whereas miscegenation was typically a felony under State laws prohibiting interracial  marriage punishable by  imprisonment or  hard labor;  Whereas in 1883, the Supreme Court held in  Pace v. Alabama that anti-miscegenation  laws were consistent with the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment as long as  the punishments given to both white and  black violators are the same;  Whereas in 1912, a constitutional amendment was proposed  in the House of Representatives prohibiting interracial marriage  ‘‘between negroes or persons of color and  Caucasians’’;  Whereas in 1923, the Supreme Court held in  Meyer v. Nebraska  that  the due process  clause of the 14th Amendment guarantees  the right of an individual ‘‘to marry, establish a home and bring up children’’;  Whereas in 1924, Virginia enacted the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which required  that a racial description of every person be  recorded at birth and prevented marriage between  ‘‘white persons’’ and non-white persons;  Whereas in 1948, the California Supreme  Court overturned the State’s anti-miscegenation statutes, thereby becoming the first  State high court to declare a ban on interracial marriage unconstitutional and making California the first State to do so in the  20th century;  Whereas  the California Supreme Court  stated in Perez v. Sharp that ‘‘a member of  any of these races may find himself barred  from marrying the person of his choice and  that person to him may be  irreplaceable.  Human beings are bereft of worth and dignity by a doctrine that would make them as  interchangeable as trains’’;  Whereas by 1948, 38 States still  forbade  interracial marriage, and 6 did so by State  constitutional provision;  Whereas in June of 1958, 2 residents of the  Commonwealth of Virginia—Mildred Jeter, a  black/Native American woman, and Richard  Perry Loving, a Caucasian man—were married in Washington, DC;  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:34 Jun 12, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K11JN7.004 H11JNPT1 E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

The Clerk read the title of the Senate  bill.  The text of the Senate bill is as follows:  S. 676  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

1416,10,2007-06-11,Mr. FALEOMAVAEGA.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of this proposed legislation.  The Inter-American Foundation is an  important agency of the United States  Government that strengthens relations  between the United States and Latin  America and makes significant contributions  to  economic development  and civil society throughout the region. The foundation, which also receives contributions  from the  Inter-  American  Development  Bank,  primarily  funds  partnerships  among  grass-roots and nonprofit organizations  and businesses and local governments.  These partnerships are directed at improving the quality of life of poor people and strengthening civic participation, accountability, and democratic  practices.  The foundation is therefore a vital  agency  that bolsters Latin America  and ought to have the full support of  relevant  agencies  and  bodies,  especially the Inter-American Development  Bank.  The  bill  before  the House  today  comes to us from the Senate. It simply  makes explicit that the executive director of the Inter-American Development Bank should be eligible for appointment to the board of the Inter-  American Foundation. While  it was  previously assumed that the head of  the bank could be appointed to the  foundation board, such eligibility was  never codified in the law.  This bill is a technical fix that our  good friends, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, Mr. BIDEN; and the senior  ranking member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, Mr. LUGAR, believe that this law should be installed.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
1417,10,2007-06-11,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation adds a  technical clarification  to  the  Inter-  American Foundation Act. By background,  this  bill would  amend  the  Inter-American  Foundation  Act  to  clarify that the President may appoint  the U.S.  executive  director  of  the  Inter-American Development Bank, or  IADB, or his alternate to serve as a  member of  the Board of  the  Inter-  American Foundation.  The Inter-American Foundation Act  requires that three members of the  nine-member board ‘‘shall be appointed  from among officers or employees of  agencies of  the United States  concerned with inter-American affairs.’’  The authors of this legislation appear  to believe the clarification is necessary  because some have recently questioned  whether or not a U.S. executive director to an international financial institution, or IFI, like the IADB, is actually an officer or employee of agencies  of the United States.  I would note simply that this question  is  largely a nonissue. To my  knowledge, never before has Congress  questioned whether a U.S. executive director could concurrently serve on the  Inter-American Foundation’s board.  Indeed, any experience with the day-  to-day operations of the international  financial  institutions would  suggest  that the U.S. executive directors to  IFIs effectively function as officers or  employees of the United States. In this  regard the World Bank Web site states  that ‘‘the U.S. executive director is an  employee of the U.S. Department of  Treasury and is supported by an alternate executive director for the United  States, as well as a team of advisers  representing different executive branch  agencies.’’  The U.S. representatives to the IFIs  receive detailed instructions from the  Secretary of the Treasury regarding  the position of the United States Government on all votes pending before  the board, as well as on all outstanding  policy matters. The U.S. representatives to these institutions are also eligible to receive employee benefits, and  the Treasury Department serves as the  employing  office  for  collecting,  accounting for all retirement and health  insurance benefits payments made by  these individuals.  Having said that, passage of this act  will certainly do no harm and may  serve to help expedite the consideration of Hector Morales to serve as a  member of the Board of Directors of  the  Inter-American Foundation. Mr.  Morales  is currently  serving as  the  United States executive director of the  Inter-American Development Bank, a  position to which he was appointed  after receiving the advice and consent  of the Senate in November 2004. The  position on the Board of Inter-American Foundation would be a part-time  appointment.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  ",2007

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. LANTOS,  chairman of the committee and my  Bay Area neighbor,  for working  so  closely with me to bring this resolution to the floor today. As the only  Holocaust survivor in the Congress, his  support of this resolution means very  much to all of us, and particularly to  me.  H. Res. 226 is a resolution to recognize American  government  officials  who played a critical role in the creation and activity of the War Refugee  Board in an effort to help rescue Jews  and other persecuted minorities during  the years of the Holocaust.  Because of their actions and because  of their bravery, an unknown number  of people were saved from the horrific  reign of Adolf Hitler and his followers.  Specifically, we are commending the  actions of Secretary of Treasury Henry  Morgenthau, Josiah DuBois and John  Pehle for their dedication and devotion  to helping rescue Jews and other persecuted minorities during  the Holocaust.  To many, World War II and the Holocaust may seem long, long, long ago.  For others, however, this is a memory  which will be imprinted in their soul  forever. Six million Jews were killed  under the brutal and evil reign of Adolf  Hitler while many countries turned a  blind eye to their ethnic cleansing and  genocide.  During this dark time, some brave  men and women  stood up and demanded that every person, no matter  their ethnic background, be  treated  justly and humanely. The people serving the War Refugee Board sent a historic cable to the diplomatic missions  ordering that ‘‘action be taken to forestall the plot of the Nazis to exterminate the Jews and other persecuted minorities in Europe.’’  b1545  They developed new programs to increase the flow of Jewish and other refugees from Nazi persecution to neutral  countries.  After the horror of the concentration  camps and extermination campaigns  were revealed, the world said  ‘‘never  again.’’  And  yet, Mr.  Speaker, we  look  around the world to see hauntingly  similar events occurring, particularly  in places like Darfur. Mr. Speaker, if  we truly wish to honor the memory of  the Holocaust victims, we must come  together to stand up in the face of bigotry and hatred all around the world  today. The action of the War Refugee  Board is an amazing example of courage, human kindness, and compassion.  Today, we  rise  to  recognize  their  service to this country and to humankind. We rise to remember the Jews  and minorities who perished under a  reign of terror. But it is with hope that  we look to the future, a future of peace  and  human  dignity  where  ‘‘never  again’’ means never again.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
1428,17,2007-06-11,Mr. BOOZMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 226 recognizes  American  government  officials who  played a critical role in the creation of  the War Refugee Board in an effort to  help rescue Jews and other persecuted  minorities during the Holocaust.  In the early stage of World War II,  there was an extensive flow of information about the extent of Jews and other  minorities being systematically murdered by the Nazi regime.  A heroic group of U.S. Government  officials  from  the Treasury Department, including Secretary of the Treasurer, Henry Morganthau, as well as Joseph DuBois and John Pehle, urged  President Franklin Roosevelt to take  more direct and forceful action to help  the victims of the Nazi atrocities.  President Roosevelt later signed an  executive order creating the War Refugee Board. Mr. John Pehle became the  executive director of the board which  helped to rescue Jews and other victims of Nazi persecution and prevented  thousands of people from dying in extermination camps.  Furthermore, the board assisted the  International Red Cross to provide food  and shelter to over 3 million prisoners  of war. Efforts by those who worked to  establish the War Refugee Board, particularly  of  Secretary  of Treasury  Henry Morganthau, Joseph DuBois, and  John Pehle, were instrumental in saving thousands of lives during the Nazi  extermination policy.  H. Res.  226  recognizes and honors  these government officials for their efforts, and I urge support for this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2007

1431,24,2007-06-11,Mr. HARE.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to honor two great community  leaders from Decatur, Illinois.  Horace ‘‘Buck’’ Livingston is a local  civil rights activist who sought higher-  paying jobs and better education for  African Americans. For over 40 years,  he has published the African American  Voice,  the  only African American  newspaper within 150 miles of Decatur,  Illinois. His tireless efforts continue to  strengthen our community and give all  of us hope for a better future.  William ‘‘Skip’’ Dempsey, my brother in the labor movement, sadly passed  away on April 13. After teaching at  Purdue University, Skip  served  for  over 12 years as training coordinator  for Plumbers and Steamfitters Local  65. He continued his leadership as a  business agent, advancing education,  economic  growth,  and  the  building  trades in the Decatur area. Skip’s valuable service will be sorely missed.  I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring the extraordinary and unselfish contributions of Buck Livingstong  and Skip Dempsey.  f  ARMING SUNNI GROUPS IS  LUNACY  (Mr. ABERCROMBIE asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)

1432,24,2007-06-11,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Madam Speaker, I rise today in the wake of news  that  comes  to us  that  the United  States will now have as a policy in Iraq  the arming of Sunni groups who have  admittedly killed and maimed Americans. We have now reached the point of  public-political lunacy.  Representative PAUL, myself, Representative JONESand others have entered a bill  for consideration of the  House that will cause us to have to reauthorize this war. Any conceivable  reason for having allowed the President to enter into this war with the enabling resolution that we passed has  now been accomplished; any  ‘‘whereas,’’ any ‘‘be it resolved’’ of that resolution is now moot.  In order  for any of us to  justify  spending one more penny or committing one more soldier of the United  States into this war, we have to have  an  up-or-down  vote  on whether  it  should be authorized.  Arming Sunni groups that have murdered U.S. service men and women as a  policy, a strategy, is without merit and  devoid of any political sensibility.  f  b1930  SPECIAL ORDERS  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. SUTTON).

1434,24,2007-06-11,Mr. SPRATT.," Madam Speaker, I am transmitting a status report on the current levels of  on-budget spending and  revenues  for  fiscal  years 2007 and 2008 and for the 5-year period of fiscal years 2008 through 2012. This  report is necessary to facilitate the application  of sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional  Budget Act and sections 204, 206 and 207 of  S. Con. Res. 21, the Concurrent Resolution on  the Budget for Fiscal Year 2008.  The  term  ‘‘current  level’’  refers  to  the  amounts of spending and revenues estimated  for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or  awaiting  the President’s signature. The  first  table in the report compares the current levels  of  total budget authority, outlays, and  revenues with the aggregate levels set by S. Con.  Res. 21. This comparison  is needed  to enforce section 311(a) of the Budget Act, which  creates a point of order against measures that  would breach  the budget resolution’s aggregate levels.  The second table compares the current levels of discretionary appropriations  for  fiscal  years 2007 and 2008 with the ‘‘section 302(b)’’  suballocations of discretionary budget authority and outlays among Appropriations subcommittees. The comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act because  the point of order under that section applies to  measures  that would breach  the applicable  section 302(b) suballocation.  The third table compares the current levels  of budget authority and outlays for each authorizing committee with the ‘‘section 302(a)’’  allocations made under S. Con. Res. 21 for  fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and fiscal years  2008 through 2012. This comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Budget Act,  which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the section 302(a) allocation of new budget authority  for  the committee that reported the measure.  The fourth table gives the current level for  fiscal years 2009 and 2010 for accounts identified for advance appropriations under section  206 of S. Con. Res. 21. This list is needed to  enforce section 206 of the budget resolution,  which creates a point of order against appropriation bills that contain advance appropriations that: (i) Are not identified in the statement of managers; or (ii) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level specified in the resolution.

1435,31,2007-06-11,Mr. MICHAUD.,"  Thank  you  very  much, Representative SA´NCHEZ. And  you’re absolutely right. These trade  deals are a slippery slope, and we definitely have  to make  sure  that we  change that trade model.  As you know, I spent over 28 years at  Great Northern Paper Company in East  Millinocket, Maine, like my father before me spent 43 years, my grandfather  before him for 40 years.  NAFTA has killed our community.  We used to have over 4,500 jobs. It’s little over 500 jobs. Small businesses have  gone under because the economy has  been devastated because of a  trade  deal. We had unemployment that was  over 33 percent.  We had  individuals who are proud  men and women who worked  in the  mill, made good wages, good health  care benefits, they ended up on the  food line. They are so many people that  went to the food bank that actually  the  food bank ran out of  food. The  whole State chipped  in and brought  food, churches, communities throughout the State to help the devastation.  And it doesn’t end there. If you go 30  miles south, another mill had closed its  doors. Another 30 miles south of that,  another mill closed its doors because of  trade.  Yes, they are getting trade assistance, but they want their jobs. And  what are they getting trained for, if  there’s no jobs to get trained?  So this definitely has caused a huge  problem, these bad trade deals in the  State of Maine, and people are upset,  and rightfully so; and that’s why it’s  important for this Congress to get off  that slippery slope and head for a new  direction, start a new direction; and  that new direction  is changing that  flawed trade policy.  And I agree 100 percent, it’s more  than just a couple of Band-Aids. We  have to look at the broader aspect of  trade.  And I really appreciate your ongoing  commitment  to do what’s  right  for  workers, to do what’s right for small  businesses in this country, and it’s the  humanitary thing to do as well. So  thank you very much, Representative  SA´NCHEZ, for your leadership in this  issue, and I’ll look forward to working  with you as we move forward to deal  with these trade issues.  I now would like to recognize a gentleman who I’ve really got to enjoy in  this Congress, a gentleman who has  really been a strong advocate for our  veterans, who definitely has been a  leader in that area on the Veterans Affairs Committee, but also a gentleman  who  is extremely  interested  in  the  trade issues, knowing what trade has  done to his State in Illinois, Congressman PHILHARE.  Thank you for coming to the floor  this evening. I look forward to hearing  your remarks as they relate to trade.  ",2007
1436,31,2007-06-11,Mr. HARE.," Thank you very much.  And I thank my friend from Maine for  his  leadership. And  as  you  know,  you’re my subcommittee chairman on  Veterans Health. And you lead and you  do a wonderful job on that committee.  And I’m  just honored to be able to  serve with you.  I want to thank you, and I want to  thank my colleague, Congresswoman  SA´NCHEZ from California, for her great  leadership on this whole issue of trade  and protecting American workers and  standing up for ordinary people.  I don’t have a prepared speech tonight, Madam Speaker. I came here tonight just to kind of have a dialogue  for a few minutes and talk about some  of these trade deals from the perspective of what I’m hearing back in my  district from ordinary people who get  up every day, worried whether or not  they’re going to keep their job.  I think we take a look at Korea. Here  we have a trade deal that they are asking us to take a look at and support.  700,000 vehicles entered this country  from Korea, yet our automobile manufacturers were allowed, allowed to ship  2,500 cars to Korea. Now, someone tell  me if that’s remotely close to being a  fair trade deal.  I don’t have a problem in the world  with saying to the Korean government,  look, I’m not asking for 700 to 700,000.  But when we are only allowed to bring  in 2,500 vehicles, compared to importing 700,000, that trade deal is dead on  arrival as far as I’m concerned.  Plus, if you look what they’re doing  to our beef production and in terms of  importing beef from this country, that  issue is basically dead. Oh, they say  they’ll talk to us about it. But talk is  cheap. And the reality of it is we have  yet seen this government be able to  move on a trade deal that makes any  sense.  You look at Colombia. I was at a  trade press conference the other day on  Colombia. As you know, as my friend  from Maine knows, Madam Speaker,  I’m a union member, president, former  president of my clothing and textile  worker local.  If I had been as vocal for my union in  the 13 years that I served in that capacity in Colombia, I probably would  have been shot. We’ve had thousands of  people who have been murdered, imprisoned, tortured. This is a government that we’re supposed to do business with. We’re supposed to trade.  Here we  are,  the United States,  greatest democracy on this planet, and  they want us to fashion some type of a  trade deal with a country that has  paramilitary people go out and assassinate trade unionists and their families. We can do a lot better than that.  I notice the President of Colombia  was here just last week, and I echo my  colleague,  Representative  SCHAKOWSKY’s remarks, Madam Speaker, when she said to President Uribe in  her remarks saying, come back in a  year. Come back in a year and prove to  this Congress and prove to the American people that you’re serious about  these violations; that you’re going to  prosecute more than 39 people, which is  all that’s been prosecuted under this  government.

I appreciate  your leadership in this area. You have  been steadfast in making certain that  these issues, and they may not be top-  tier issues, they may not be headlines  in all of our newspapers, but your district, like my district, I have a suburban district outside of Atlanta, and  folks there are concerned about what  folks all across this Nation are concerned about.  ",2007
1438,38,2007-06-11,Mr. KIRK.," We have seen consistently  that while events in Iran or Iraq, while  issues  concerning  global  climate  change, and of course the immigration  bill in the Senate are all front-burner  issues, but for American families, education, health care, protecting the environment and saving for college are  important issues.  ",2007
1439,38,2007-06-11,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," That really is  true. When I talk with groups at home,  and once we get past the hot button,  the headline issues of Iraq and immigration and the like, people are concerned about education for their kids  and they are concerned about health  care for themselves and their parents.  They are concerned about security and  quality of life issues in their community to make certain that there  is  going to be green space and there are  places where can take their kids.  I was sitting in my office and I had to  come down and join you. These are not  Republican issues or Democrat issues,  these are American issues.  b2115  They’re issues that I think all of the  House can rally around. And you mentioned the health care issue, and as a  physician, I understand as well as anybody I suspect about the importance of  being able to provide health insurance  for families.  We live in a world now where jobs  aren’t constant. It used to be that your  dad and my dad and other folks, they’d  get a job and they’d be with that same  company 25, 30, 35 years, and they’d get  a gold watch and they’d move on and  they’d  take  that health  care with  them. Now, that’s not the case. Our  children will have 7, 8, 9, 10 different  jobs, 10 different employers and oftentimes having themselves as being self-  employed.  ",2007
1440,38,2007-06-11,Mr. KIRK.," One solution would be to  have the government take over everyone’s health care and to make sure we  take action that breaks the link between you and your physician and insert a large bureaucracy that currently  runs the post office and now put it in  charge of your health care.  Many of us think that that may not  be the way to go. The way to go is to  make sure that for many Americans,  they  like the health  insurance plan  that they’re on, and then they would  like to carry that through the five to  seven jobs that they will have in the  21st century.  ",2007
1441,38,2007-06-11,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Exactly. And  that hits the nail right on the head.  People want to know that their health  care is going to be consistent and they  have the ability, along with their physicians, to make health care decisions,  which  is why  the Health  Insurance  Portability  Act  that  Congressman  DENT is reintroducing is so important.  It makes it so, as I understand, that  if an  individual  changes  jobs,  that  they’re able to provide that COBRA insurance for as long as needed. So it  makes  it so they can continue that  COBRA insurance for a much longer  period of time, to tide them over until  they’re with another employer or they  can be able to provide for individual insurance on their own.  It’s not the be-all-and-end-all, but it  is a particularly important piece of the  puzzle that makes it so that people can  maintain their own health insurance,  and I know that you agree with that.  ",2007
1442,38,2007-06-11,Mr. KIRK.," The need here is to remove the fear that somehow a loss of a  job or discovery of a preexisting condition will deny Americans and their  families health care insurance. What  we want to make sure is you already  have a right under Federal law to extend your health care insurance for 18  months. Now, we’re not talking about  extending it indefinitely, because when  an American reaches age 65, you’re  going to be covered by Medicare, and if  you fall below the poverty line, you’re  going to be covered by Medicaid.  But for large numbers of people, especially looking at an unsure job market,  we want to have them assured by this  piece of legislation that there’s always  a safe place for their family to be covered.  ",2007
1443,38,2007-06-11,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Exactly, and  that gets to the number of uninsured  that we have in this Nation. There are  45, 46, 47 million individuals who at  some point during this calendar year  will  be  without  health  insurance.  Those aren’t the folks that are on Medicaid. Those aren’t the folks that are  on Medicare. Those are the folks that  are between jobs oftentimes, who are  unable to continue the COBRA insurance that they ought to be able to, and  this is what this bill would do. It would  really, really solve one of the major  problems that we have with working  Americans who do indeed want to provide health insurance for families.  So I commend you for your leadership on this issue and so many others.  The Senior Safety Indignity Act is  extremely important. I served in the  State legislature, as I know many folks  in this chamber did, and every single  year we would hear horror  stories  about problems of health care workers  in the nursing home or extended care  facility arena.  And in Georgia what we tried to do  was a similar kind of thing to make  certain that background checks were  available, and this would provide that  kind of security and that kind of important information for individuals in  the senior centers so that we know  that the folks who were going to be assisting seniors and caring for seniors  have the appropriate skills and the appropriate background  in order to do  that.  ",2007
1444,38,2007-06-11,Mr. KIRK.," The gentleman is one of  the most respected physicians here in  the Congress. The difficulty before this  country is that the baby boom began  when the troops came home in 1945. So,  for an American born in that key year,  you’re going to be collecting a retirement check in 2009 when you hit your  65th  birthday. There  are  so many  Americans that then enter the retirement cohort and that may need nursing home care. That is the critical reason why this Congress may have to  work on fewer bills naming post offices  and designating  roads and more on  making sure that we maintain quality  senior care as the baby boom generation retires.  ",2007
1445,38,2007-06-11,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," I appreciate  that, and the point that you’re making  is so vital for all of us in this chamber  to appreciate, and that is, that we’ve  now been in session 51⁄2months, and  we’ve passed and sent to the President  about 28 to 30 pieces of legislation. Almost the majority of those are naming  a building or naming a post office or  renaming a building or renaming a post  office.  And these issues here, if you look  down the  list of those seven  issues,  from the gang elimination to teacher  and student safety, to other education  issues with 401 Kids Family Savings  Act or the Health Insurance Act that  we talked about, the Deleting Online  Predators Act, open space, Senior Safety Act, these are the issues that are of  vital importance to the American people all across this Nation. These are  issues that, frankly, ought to get the  vast majority of Members of this chamber on both sides of the aisle’s support  so that we could move forward with  real legislation for real people.  ",2007
1446,38,2007-06-11,Mr. KIRK.," I take the gentleman’s  point.

1519,66,2007-06-11,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Some of that time  may be yielded back, but I didn’t want  to cut off anyone who wishes to speak  on this issue before we go to a vote.  Mr. President, today we begin consideration of energy  legislation  in the  Senate. Later today, we will be voting  to take up legislation that will make a  meaningful and bipartisan contribution  to charting a new direction for America’s energy policy.  There is a growing consensus among  Federal, State, and local policymakers  across the ideological spectrum, also  from corporate leaders and the American public in general, that our Nation  needs to move faster and needs to go  farther to secure its energy future.  America’s family farmers and businesses look no further than the prices  that are posted at the corner gas station to see the vivid and daily indicators of the economic perils inherent in  maintaining the status quo. In  fact,  they have watched as gas prices have  stayed at more than $3 per gallon for  well over a month.  Our national  security experts cite  the geopolitical implications and the  foreign policy challenges presented by  the rise of State-owned energy companies and by our own growing dependence on oil imports. In 2005, the United  States imported roughly 60 percent of  the petroleum that we consumed. Without decisive action, that figure is expected to approach 70 percent over the  next two decades, with more than 35  percent of that  increase expected to  come from member nations of OPEC or  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Meanwhile, economists take note of  our energy policy’s fiscal implications  as well  related  to America’s global  competitiveness. In 2005 and 2006, our  dependence on petroleum imports combined with rising prices to add an estimated $120 billion to our Nation’s trade  deficit.  There is no doubt there is a compelling case for action, but there is also  something more fundamental that is  embedded in the American consciousness that  is animating the national  call for a new direction in our energy  policy.  President Franklin Roosevelt once  observed:  The creed of our democracy is that liberty  is acquired and kept by men and women who  are strong and self- reliant.  Perhaps it is this American principle  of self-reliance that is driving national  debate forward when it comes to energy policy.  After all, by tapping America’s limitless capacity for innovation, our most  abundant  renewable  resource,  the  United States can become more energy  self-sufficient.

1531,73,2007-06-11,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Madam President,  there are four ways to become a Senator: by appointment, by special election, by winning an open seat, or by defeating an incumbent.  My good friend from New York, who  has been speaking, and I came to the  Senate the same way: by defeating an  incumbent. That way is often the hardest, so I am sure the Senator remembers his 1998 Senate race against our  former colleague, Senator Al D’Amato.  It was quite a race. The Senator from  New York surely remembers one of his  criticisms of Senator D’Amato: that  Senator D’Amato  had,  in  essence,  abused his office.  My friend from New York said it was  improper for Senator D’Amato to use  his official Senate position to investigate the former first lady while Senator D’Amato was also chairman of his  party’s Senate campaign committee,  the NRSC. My friend from New York  said, in referring to Senator D’Amato:  Do you know what he did right after he got  elected? He became chairman of the national  Senate Republican Campaign Committee,  the most blatantly political position you can  hold. Then . . . he embarked on his partisan  and political inquisition of the First Family.  According to the New York Times,  the thing about Senator D’Amato’s activities that my friend from New York  appeared to  find particularly galling  was that his behavior was motivated  by reelection concerns.  Given the two hats my friend from  New York currently wears, you can see  why I obviously found the standard he  set out in 1998 to be quite intriguing.  We all talk to the media—some of us  more than others—and we may make  offhand comments we later regret, especially in the heat of a campaign. But  the Senator from New York thought  his conflict of interest charge was so  important that he ran a television ad  about it. The Buffalo News reported:  Among the blizzard of attack ads running  this weekend  is  one  in which Schumer  charged  that D’Amato used  the Banking  Committee . . . to mount a ’vicious’ partisan  attack on first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton  three years ago.  Now, New York is certainly an expensive media market. Yet because my  good friend from New York was so concerned  with  Senator  D’Amato’s  chairing the NRSC while he was investigating the First Lady, he spent a lot  of money urging New Yorkers to remove Senator D’Amato from office. So  he must have really thought it was a  serious conflict for someone to lead his  party’s campaign committee while also  leading an investigation into an administration of the opposite party.  How times change, Madam President.  Now my good friend is leading his party’s principal campaign committee for  the Senate, the DSCC. At the same  time, he is leading an official Senate  investigation into the Justice Department.  He  chairs  the  Judiciary  Subcommittee  on Administrative Oversight and the Courts.  The media widely reports that he has  been tapped by the majority leader to  lead this investigation. The piece in  the National Journal calls him  the  Democratic ‘‘point man’’ on this particular subject—our good friend from  New York.  He usually has chaired one of the numerous hearings the committee has already held on this subject. To borrow  from the National Journal, you could  say he is ubiquitous when it comes to  this subject.  The campaign committee he chairs  has repeatedly used material derived  from his  investigation  for  partisan  campaign purposes.  He held a press conference before the  ink was barely dry on the Schumer resolution. There, he predicted, amazingly, that we would go to this resolution  immediately after  immigration.  And it looks as if the majority leader  filed cloture on immigration to make  sure we kept the schedule of my good  friend from New York.  Last, but not least, he is the author  of the resolution we will be voting on  in a little while.

Res. 14, a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that  Attorney General Gonzales has lost the  confidence of Congress and the American people. This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.  Now, Madam President, let me initially say that I was doing other things  and was unable to  listen to the remarks of some of my Republican colleagues. I apologize for that. I have had  a briefing as to what they said. They  have chosen to impugn the motives of  the sponsor of this resolution, the senior Senator from New York, ",2007
1534,80,2007-06-11,Mr. SCHUMER.," I work very closely with this man.  I have worked in government most all  of my adult life. Rarely have I seen  anybody—in  fact,  I have never seen  anyone with the intellectual capacity  of CHUCKSCHUMER from New York and  his ability to understand what is going  on in the State of New York and in our  country. Any  suggestions  that were  made to impugn his integrity are unwarranted, out of line, and unfair.  Senator SCHUMER is a member of the  Judiciary Committee. He is a lawyer.  As a member of that Judiciary Committee and as a lawyer who cares deeply about the rule of law and the reputation of the Justice Department, he had  an obligation to do what he did. There  are others who joined with him. Senator FEINSTEINwas out front on this  issue with Senator SCHUMER, as were  others. The  chairman  of  the  committee, Senator LEAHY, has been with  them every step of the way.  In my opinion, his work in this investigation has been commendable.  ",2007

1537,80,2007-06-11,Mr. LEAHY.," Madam President, I tell  the leader and the senior Senator from  New York, I know he has worked hard  on this. Nobody has had more roadblocks thrown in front of him than the  Senator from New York. He has asked  legitimate questions. Many times, his  legitimate questions were not answered  by the Department of Justice. They refused to answer. We had to actually  subpoena them to get answers that  should have been sent to him by return  courier. He has acted in the best sense  of oversight. He has done what one  should do in oversight. He should not  be criticized for that.  Maybe those who do the criticizing  should  ask  why  they  allowed  a  rubberstamp Senate under their watch  to continue for 6 years, with conduct  that certainly borders on the criminal  and certainly reflects the unethical goings-on at the Department of Justice,  and they didn’t say one word about it.  ",2007
1538,80,2007-06-11,Mr. REID.," Madam President, I appreciate very much  the Senator  from  Vermont, the chairman of our comis  mittee,  for standing up  for what  right. That is what he is doing.  The Senate has a responsibility to  express its displeasure with a Cabinet  officer who has grossly mismanaged his  responsibilities and  failed the American people in the process. This is the  one  and  only mechanism we have,  short of impeachment, to address malfeasance of a high-ranking Federal official.  Along with the Department of Defense and State, the Department of  Justice is the most important Cabinet  agency we have. The Attorney General  is  responsible  for  enforcing Federal  law, protecting civil rights, and, most  importantly, ensuring fidelity to the  Constitution of the United States.  Madam President, in my young days  as a lawyer and public official in Nevada, during the 1960s, I saw the critical role the Justice Department can  play in what is going on in a State. In  those days—the early sixties—a person  of color, a Black man or woman, could  not work in a Strip hotel and could not  work in downtown hotels. They weren’t  there unless they were a porter, a janitor—someplace where they could not  be seen. Thousands of people, Black  and White, protested that discrimination, but it didn’t matter until the Justice Department  stepped  in.  They  stepped in and forced it. There was a  consent decree entered  into between  the State of Nevada—I was there. I was  Lieutenant Governor, and I helped negotiate  that  along  with  Governor  O’Callaghan and the attorney assigned  to do that. We worked on that  for  weeks and weeks. But for the Justice  Department, that integration of those  large hotels  in Nevada would have  taken place much later. That is what  the Justice Department is all about.  Major civil rights battles in Las Vegas  over integrating the strip would never  have been determined in favor of the  people of color but for the Justice Department.  You see, the Justice Department is  color blind, and that is the way it is  supposed to be. It wasn’t a Democratic  Department of Justice or Republican  Department  of  Justice.  It was  an  American, a U.S. Department of Justice. Its lawyers were fighting for the  most American ideal—the right of all  Americans to participate in our democracy.  What a proud history this is. What a  source of pride it is for our country  what the Justice Department in decades past has done. But today under  this President, President Bush, and  under this Attorney General, Alberto  Gonzales, the Department of Justice  has lost its way.  Now the Justice Department is just  another arm of the Karl Rove political  machine, where partisanship earns patronage and independence earns contempt.  Today’s Justice Department is dysfunctional. I so appreciate the statement made by the former attorney general of the State of Rhode Island, SenJOHN ENSIGN,  ator WHITEHOUSE. He laid it out. He has  a feeling of what the Justice Department is all about. He spoke from his  heart. The Department of Justice’s  credibility is shredded. Its morale is at  an all-time low, and the blame for that  tragic deterioration  lies squarely on  the shoulders of two people: the President of the United States and the Attorney General of the United States,  Alberto Gonzales.  We are here today to discuss Alberto  Gonzales. Over the past 6 months, congressional oversight has revealed the  many ways the crass political calculations in that White House have pervaded the personnel and prosecutorial  decisions of the Bush-Gonzales Justice  Department. Remember,  for 4 years,  this was a big rubberstamp, this thing  called Congress.  The careers of many fine men and  women, lawyers, have been destroyed.  One of those is a man from Nevada by  the name of Daniel Bogden, a career  prosecutor. He worked his way up as a  line  prosecutor  in Washoe County,  Reno, NV, and became an assistant  U.S. attorney. He—I have spoken with  him—wanted to spend his life being a  prosecutor, going after people who violate the law. That is over with. Once  you are removed from being a U.S. attorney, you can no longer work as a  deputy U.S. attorney.  He, I repeat, was a career prosecutor.  When my Republican friend and colleague,  recommended  him to be U.S. attorney for Nevada, he  reached what he thought was the pinnacle of his career. Oh, was he mistaken. He has been humiliated, embarrassed, denigrated by this Justice Department  for no  reason. He worked  hard. No one questioned his work ethic.  My son was a deputy U.S. attorney  with Daniel Bogden. They worked together. A fine lawyer is Daniel Bogden.  He worked hard as our U.S. attorney to  protect Nevadans from crimes, drugs  and white-collar crimes and earned a  wide  respect  from  law  enforcement  agencies throughout the State.  I repeat, he was fired. To this day, no  satisfactory explanation has been provided to Dan Bogden and the people of  Nevada.  In light of this evidence, we learned  that other U.S. attorneys had been  fired at the same time because they  failed  to  pursue  partisan  political  cases. So without any question, there  is every reason to believe Dan Bogden  suffered the same fate. He was fired for  administering justice in Nevada in an  evenhanded, nonpolitical way, as he  thought as a prosecutor he was supposed to do.  I can remember as a young lawyer, I  had a part-time job as a city attorney  in Henderson, NV. It is now the second  largest city  in the State.  It wasn’t  then.  I prosecuted criminal cases.  I  came back to my law firm and I was  bragging. That is the wrong word. I was  saying: Man, that case, I can’t imagine  why that judge did that. That wasn’t a  very good case at all.

On June 29–July 1, the  residents of Noonan will gather to celebrate their community’s history and  founding.  Noonan is a thriving rural community in northwest North Dakota that  shares a border with  the Canadian  province  of  Saskatchewan.  Noonan  holds an important place in North Dakota’s history. Like many of the rural  communities in North Dakota, Noonan  began its history as a community with  the arrival of the Great Northern Railroad. Noonan received its name from  Patrick Noonan, the  first mayor of  Noonan. The first businesses in Noonan  included  the Golden Rule General  Store, an implement store, and a hotel.  Noonan officially became a city on  September 14, 1928.  Today, the community of Noonan is  largely based on agriculture and  is  home to some of the best waterfowl  and upland game hunting in northwest  North Dakota. There is also a volunteer fire department and EMT service,  two  taverns, and many other businesses  in this close-knit community  where everyone knows everyone. The  nearby Noonan trout pond offers camping and fishing. Noonan is also home to  a prominent Lions Club chapter, which  is the oldest service organization  in  Noonan and whose main goal is to help  the blind.  The community of Noonan is a wonderful place for its residents to live,  work, and raise future generations. The  people of Noonan take pride in their  community and all the opportunities it  has to offer. The town has an exciting  centennial weekend planned that  includes dances, a parade, variety show,  a Sunday brunch, and much more.  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Noonan, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in  wishing them well through the next  century. By honoring Noonan and all  other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep  the great pioneering  frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Noonan that  have helped to shape this country into  what it is today, which is why this fine  community is deserving of our recognition.  Noonan has a proud past and a bright  future.∑  f  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF  GRANVILLE, NORTH DAKOTA  ∑",2007

On June  29–July 1, the residents of Granville  will gather to celebrate their community’s history and founding.  Granville is a friendly rural community located in northern North Dakota.  William Christianson, along with his  wife Minnie, were the first non-native  people to settle the soon-to-be prairie  town of Granville in 1895. William was  an employee of the Great Northern  Railway, and the town of Granville was  named after Granville M. Dodge, a civil  engineer for the railway. Established in  1901, the Granville State bank was one  of  the  first  businesses  established.  Granville was officially declared a city  in 1907.  Today, like so many smaller rural  communities in North Dakota, Granville is a tight-knit town where everyone knows their neighbor. Granville is  known  for  its welcoming hospitality  and conversation and it is easy to witness this  local atmosphere at Granville’s Memorial Diner. A beautiful  city park offers a chance for parents  and their children to have fun and play  together.  The community of Granville  is a  wonderful place for its citizens to live  and experience life together. The people of Granville take great pride  in  their community and all it has to offer.  To celebrate their centennial anniversary,  the  town will  be  holding  a  barbeque, wagon  train,  parade,  and  fireworks.

On July  5–8,  the  residents of Cooperstown will celebrate  their community’s history and founding.  Cooperstown is a vibrant community  located in east-central North Dakota.  The town was founded in 1882 by Rollin  and Thomas Cooper, who had  previously been miners  in Colorado. As  with many communities in North Dakota, the arrival of the railroad in 1883  contributed greatly to Cooperstown’s  growth. The town’s post office was established on December 28, 1882. The  town continued to grow, becoming incorporated as a village in 1892 and as a  city in 1906.  Today, Cooperstown plays host  to  manufacturers, agricultural businesses,  and many other local companies. Cooperstown is also proud to boast a strong  community, with chapters of 4–H, the  American Legion, and the Boy and Girl  Scouts of America, in addition to several local community organizations.  Tourism  opportunities  abound  in  Cooperstown.  Sportsmen  seek  out  hunting and  fishing near Lake Ashtabula and the Red River Lake. The  Cooper Theater hosts local plays, and  the Griggs County Museum provides a  window on Cooperstown’s past.  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Cooperstown, ND, and its  residents on their first 125 years and in  wishing them well in the future. By  honoring  Cooperstown  and  all  the  other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great tradition of  the pioneering frontier spirit alive for  future generations.

1543,94,2007-06-11,Mr. INHOFE.," Mr. President, I rise  today for myself and on the behalf of  my colleague, Dr. COBURN, to reintroduce a bill to honor the memory of an  American hero and proud son from our  great State of Oklahoma. Ernest Childers was the first Native American to  receive  the Congressional Medal  of  Honor. This  is our Nation’s highest  military award and it was awarded to  him by Congress ‘‘for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life  above and beyond the call of duty in  action.’’  Ernest Childers was born in Broken  Arrow, Oklahoma, on February 1, 1918  as the third of five children. His father  died when he was young and he grew up  mostly on a farm. His hunting skills in  his youth provided much of the food for  his family and formed the basis of a  great military career.  Ernest Childers enlisted in the Oklahoma National Guard in 1937 while attending the Chilocco Indian School in  north-central Oklahoma. He then went  to Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma, for  basic training before being deployed to  Africa in World War II. On September  22, 1943, despite a broken instep that  forced him to crawl, Second Lieutenant  Childers advanced against enemy machine gun nests in Oliveto, Italy, killing  two  snipers  and  capturing  an  enemy mortar observer in the process.  His actions were instrumental in helping the Americans win the Battle of  Oliveto and won him the Congressional  Medal of Honor. He continued his career in the Army earning several other  military awards including the Combat  Infantry Badge, Europe  and Africa  Campaign Medals, The Purple Heart,  The Bronze Star, and the Oklahoma  Distinguished Service Cross. He retired  from the Army in August of 1965 as a  lieutenant colonel in Oklahoma’s 45th  Infantry Division.  Ernest  Childers  passed  away  on  March 17, 2005, and was Oklahoma’s  last Congressional Medal of Honor winner still living in the State. He was an  honored guest of many Presidential inaugurations and as a Creek Indian, was  named Oklahoma’s Most Outstanding  Indian by the Tulsa Chapter of the  Council of American Indians in 1966. He  once said  ‘‘The American Indian has  only one country to defend, and when  you’re picked on, the American Indian  never turns his back.’’ I am proud and  believe it is only appropriate to introduce once again this year a bill to rename the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Outpatient Clinic in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the Ernest Childers Department  of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic  to honor the enduring legacy of a true  hero and fine soldier. I ask unanimous  consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 1585  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ERNEST CHILDERS  DEPARTMENT  OF  VETERANS  AFFAIRS OUTPATIENT CLINIC.

1545,136,2007-06-11,Ms. DEGETTE.," Madam Speaker,  I would  like to recognize the remarkable history and  invaluable contributions of an extraordinary  hospital  in  the 1st Congressional District of  Colorado.  It  is  fitting  that we recognize  this  outstanding  institution  for  its  leadership  in  health care and rehabilitation and for its enduring service to the people of our community  and our Nation. It is to commend this distinguished organization that I rise to honor the  Craig Hospital on the occasion of its 100th Anniversary, ‘‘Celebrating a Century of Rebuilding Lives.’’  The growing  importance of  innovation  in  health care to our well being as a society and  our quality of  life  is well documented. Craig  Hospital is a powerful community of hope and  it provides people with new possibilities. Craig  has set  the standard  for quality patient outcomes. It is an internationally recognized leader in health care and has long been recognized as a premier national center of excellence in the specialties of rehabilitation and research  for patients with spinal cord  injuries  and acquired brain injuries.  From  its  founding as  the  ‘‘Tent Colony of  Brotherly Love’’ in 1907 to the world class facility we know today, Craig Hospital continues  to be a beacon of hope and remains committed to the well being of its patients. Rehabilitation is a process very different from traditional medical care.  It  involves  teaching patients and families to care for themselves. It  requires setting high expectations and hard  work by patients to maximize neurological recovery, restore  functional abilities and make  the psychological adjustments needed  to remain as independent and productive as possible.  Since 1956, Craig Hospital has treated more  than 25,500 patients—more spinal cord injury  patients  than any other single  facility  in  the  world. Last year, Craig treated patients from  48 states and  for  the past 18 years,  it has  been ranked among the Top Ten Rehabilitation Hospitals by U.S. News and World Report. Its spinal cord and traumatic brain injury  rehabilitation programs are designated by the  U.S. National Institute on Disability Rehabilitation and Research (NIDRR) as Model Systems  Centers. Since 2006, Craig is the NIDRR National Database and Statistical Center (HDSC)  for the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems.  Craig Hospital has burnished a reputation of  compassion and legacy of care rivaled by very  few. Patients have characterized Craig Hospital as  ‘‘a miracle (that  is) here  for patient  care, not  for health care dollars;’’ as  ‘‘phenomenal at all they do for patients and families.’’ It comes as no surprise that Craig Hospital has been awarded Magnet Designation—  a national honor—by  the American Nurses  Credentialing Center for its excellence in staff  collaboration and teamwork and for the spirit  of inquiry among bed-side nurses as to what  is best for patient care. Truly we, as residents  of the 1st Congressional District, are fortunate  indeed to have an asset of such magnitude in  our community.  Please join me in commending Craig Hospital for its 100 years of leadership in health  care and its invaluable service to our community and our Nation. It is the commitment and  dedication that Craig Hospital and members of  its staff exhibit on a daily basis which continually enhances our lives and builds a better  future for all of our people.  f  CELEBRATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY  OF  NANCY  OSBORNE’S  SERVICE TO KFSN–TV ABC 30  HON. JIM COSTA  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 7, 2007  ",2007
1546,136,2007-06-11,Mr. COSTA.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate and honor the distinguished career  of Nancy Osborne, on  the occasion of her  30th anniversary of being part of the KFSN–  TV ABC 30 family in California’s Central Valley.  Nancy grew up on Army bases in the United  States as well as Japan and Turkey. She  graduated  from Las Cruces High School  in  New Mexico and attended New Mexico State  University for 3 years. In between a 5-year hiatus from college and motherhood, Nancy relocated to Fresno, CA, in 1973. Upon settling  in Fresno, she returned to college and graduated  from Fresno State University with a  bachelors of arts degree  in speech communications in 1976.  A year into graduate school at Fresno State,  Nancy accepted a reporting job with KFSN–TV  30, the local ABC affiliate television station in  Fresno, California and became one of only a  handful of women in the local broadcast industry. Nancy’s success continued as she joined  the anchor  team at KFSN–TV  in  the  fall of  1977 and again in 1980 when she produced  and anchored  the Valley’s  first  locally produced news magazine show along with co-anchoring the Action News Program.  Nancy’s promising career with ABC 30 continued throughout the years and in 1996 she  accepted  the challenge of  joining  the Action  News Management team. While continuing her  coverage of  the Valley’s political scene and  issues involving children and families, she was  named Executive Producer—Special Projects,  a position which allowed her to play a key role  in helping shape Action News around  the  clock.  In January 2004, Nancy returned to reporting full time, bringing her experience and expertise  to  the expanding daily Action News  coverage.  In addition  to  full-time  reporting,  Nancy also co-anchors Action News Live at  Five with Warren Armstrong.  Through the 30 years of service and loyalty  to KFSN–TV ABC 30, Nancy Osborne has  demonstrated the highest level of dedication to  her community. She has emerged as one of  the Valley’s most trusted names in news and  her contributions to the Valley’s broadcast industry will never be forgotten. It is my sincere  hope  that continued health, prosperity, and  success be with Nancy through all her future  endeavors.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF RANDY  PRIDEAUX  HON. PAUL RYAN  OFWISCONSIN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 7, 2007  ",2007
1547,136,2007-06-11,Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin.," Madam Speaker, I  would like to pay tribute to the life of Randy  Prideaux, a civic-minded business leader and  longtime resident of Union Grove, Wisconsin  whose energetic commitment  to his community touched countless lives. Randy died unexpectedly last week, sending waves of shock  and sorrow through Southeastern Wisconsin,  where he was well-known  through his business and civic leadership.  Randy worked his way up  the  ladder at  Union Grove Lumber over nearly 40 years to  become CEO of this local lumber and hardware business. He also served as a member  of my Small Business Advisory Board, and I  am grateful that he took the time to share his  expertise with us. He knew the challenges that  small business owners  face day  in and day  out, and his  insights on  issues  from health  care to tax policies were very helpful. If there  was one thing you could always count on, it  was that Randy would tell you what he truly  thought, whether he agreed or disagreed with  you. His candor and his dedication to doing  what  is right  for Union Grove will be sorely  missed.  Besides working to strengthen the community as an employer and businessman, Randy  gave back in many other ways. Altogether, he  served 20 years on the Village Board. He was  active in the Union Grove Lions Club and had  served two terms as president. He also served  two  terms as president of  the Chamber of  Commerce.  In his personal life, Randy was a devoted  family man, who  recently became a grandfather. My thoughts and prayers are with his  wife,  children, granddaughter, mother, and  brother, and the many friends throughout Wisconsin who mourn his loss.  f  HONORING JUDITH REED MEHAL  HON.

1549,143,2007-06-11,Mr. COURTNEY.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today to recognize the Reverend Edmund M.  O’Brien, a resident of Connecticut’s Second  Congressional District, who is celebrating his  50th year as an ordained priest.  Devoting his life to the service of others, Father O’Brien has faithfully tended to the people  of Connecticut as a pastor, teacher, principal,  and friend.  Father O’Brien was ordained on February 2,  1957, after completing his education at the St.  John Seminary in Boston. Over the past 50  years, he has served as a dedicated pastor  and educator to many Connecticut congregations. Currently, he is pastor of St. Adalbert  parish  in Enfield and director of  the parish  school.  He once said of his profession, ‘‘a teacher  affects eternity.’’ As a counselor and consummate supporter of his students, Father O’Brien  embodies  the compassionate, nurturing, and  dedicated values characteristic of our Nation’s  greatest educators.  A die hard fan of the celebrated Boston Red  Sox, Father O’Brien  is well-known  for delivering score updates to his parishioners when  a game has been  inconveniently scheduled  during a mass celebration.  I am honored to pay tribute to the Reverend  Edmund M. O’Brien. Father O’Brien’s dedication to his faith, his community, and the children under his care has been, and continues  to be, an inspiration to myself and the residents of eastern Connecticut.  f  A TRIBUTE TO TEMPLE BETH  DAVID  HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 7, 2007  ",2007
1550,143,2007-06-11,Mr. SCHIFF.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor Temple Beth David, which will be  celebrating  its 60th anniversary  this year.  In  the past 60 years, the temple has grown into  a vibrant community dedicated to the values of  Judaism  including  spiritual  discovery,  educational richness, and the love and kindness  of community and personal responsibility.  Founded by 10  families  in 1947, Temple  Beth David was the first reform synagogue in  the San Gabriel Valley. The original founder,  Flora Kahn, is still a member of the congregation. Since its inception, the temple has seen  its membership grow to 195 families, spanning  the generations. The community welcomes all  Jews as well as interfaith couples and encourages non-Jewish spouses  to participate  in  temple life.  Rabbi Alan Lachtman has been with  the  temple in his current position since 1976. A retired Lieutenant Colonel  from  the Army Reserves, Rabbi Lachtman has a degree in Marriage Family Therapy and received the Doctorate of Divinity from Hebrew Union College  in 1999. He currently teaches at the University  of Judaism, and works closely with the American Jewish Committee and the Archdiocese  of Los Angeles.  A dynamic and active temple, Temple Beth  David  encourages  congregant  participation  and offers a wide variety of programs  from  interfaith programs and social action projects  to  religious  and  Hebrew  schools.  Demonstrating a commitment to all members of the  community, Temple Beth David offers not only  youth scholarships but also an array of adult  education programs  for  those who seek a  greater understanding of Judaism.  Committed participants not only  in  temple  life but in the larger world as well, the members of Temple Beth David have  recently  joined  the  interfaith chorus calling  for U.S.  Government intervention in Darfur. Along with  Rabbi Lachtman, the 195 families of the temple, mindful of their own community’s history,  are activists for the civilians in Darfur.  It  is my privilege  to honor Temple Beth  David on its anniversary of 60 years of active  community and fulfillment in Judaism. I ask all  members  to  join me  in wishing  the Temple  Beth David and its congregants continued success.  f  IN HONOR OF THE CAREER AND  ACHIEVEMENTS OF DR. ALBERT  J. SIMONE  HON. LOUISE McINTOSH SLAUGHTER  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 7, 2007  ",2007
1551,143,2007-06-11,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to celebrate the achievements of a distinguished academic who  I am privileged  to  call my  friend, Dr. Albert  J. Simone. Dr.  Simone has served as the President of Rochester Institute of Technology since September  1, 1992, and during that time I have had the  pleasure of working with him as he advanced  the university’s reputation as a leading career-  oriented institution. He is retiring his post this  year, and his vision and  leadership will be  sorely missed.  Before taking the helm at RIT, Dr. Simone  served as president of the University of Hawaii  System and chancellor of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. He also taught at several well-  respected institutions for higher education, including  the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, Tufts University, Northeastern University, Boston College, Boston University, University of Cincinnati, and the University of Hawaii. But his achievements go far beyond administration and instruction.  Dr. Simone has authored countless publications, including books and journal articles on  the application of mathematics, statistics, and  computers to economics and business. He is  a founding editor of Decision Sciences and is  a past president and fellow of the Institute of  Decision Sciences. And, although he is retiring, he will continue to make contributions to  academia as he is currently in the process of  collecting data for a book he will be writing on  higher education.  A true trailblazer, Dr. Simone was the first  American university president to officially visit  North Korea, Vietnam, and Vladivostok when  these  regions were  closed  to  the United  States except for cultural and educational exchange. He oversaw the launch of three Ph.D.  programs at RIT in the areas of microsystems  engineering,  computing  and  information  sciences, and color science. And, under his  stewardship, six bachelor’s degree programs  have been added to the university’s offerings,  including programs in information technology,  software engineering, chemistry and polymer  chemistry, biochemistry, advertising and public  relations, and new media publishing. These  new programs represent  the university’s understanding of  the needs of  the community  outside of it, and help distinguish the City of  Rochester as a center for innovation and entrepreneurship.  Dr. Simone  led RIT’s  largest capital campaign, raising $310 million which enabled the  university to add over 210 new scholarships,  name three colleges, add seven new endowed  professorships, build nine new campus facilities, add $90 million in new applied research  initiatives, and add $34 million to the RIT endowment. This  capital  campaign enhanced  RIT’s reputation, made college education more  accessible for more students, and gave students and faculty better resources to pursue  their academic endeavors.  Thanks to Dr. Simone and the programs he  has cultivated at RIT, the university has become a strong partner  in regional economic  development efforts. His endeavors have consistently reflected his belief that the ‘‘‘R’ in RIT  means something.’’ Aside from creating academic programs at the university to address  the business needs of Rochester and the surrounding region, Dr. Simone served as chairman of  the board of  the Greater Rochester  Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, and currently serves on the boards of the Rochester  Business Alliance, the Center for Government  Research, and the Finger Lakes Partnership  for  the WIRED  initiative. His  involvement  in  these and countless other community organizations has benefited not only the organizations themselves, but also the university and  its  students by establishing  important networking opportunities and using  the knowledge from those relationships to inform the direction of the university.  Dr. Simone has been recognized by several  organizations  throughout Western New York  and the Nation for his outstanding leadership  and community involvement. He was the recipient of the Entrepreneurial American Leadership Award from Partners or Livable Communities (2006), the YWCA of Rochester and  Monroe County Racial Justice Award (2005),  the Rochester  International Council  International Citizen Award  (2004),  the National  Association of Student Affairs Professionals  President’s Award (2001), and the Rochester  Business Alliance Civic Medal among many,  many others.  RIT and the community surrounding it owe  a debt of gratitude to Dr. Simone, and I am  honored today to have the opportunity to pay  tribute to his service. His legacy will live on at  RIT, and I look forward to seeing the university continue to flourish. I wish Dr. Simone and  his wife Carolie, their four children, and five  grandchildren the best during his retirement.  f  TRIBUTE TO JAMES O. RICH  HON. JAMES E.

1553,150,2007-06-11,Ms. NORTON.," Madam Speaker, today I introduce the ‘‘District of Columbia Loan Repayment Equity Technical Amendment Act of  2007.’’ This bill will ensure  that undeserved  communities in the District of Columbia have  access to adequate health care services in selected  health  professional  shortage  areas,  HPSAs, identified by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services under  the State Loan Repayment Program, as Congress intended. This bill does not involve any  new funds. It will make the District eligible to  receive assistance through the Public Health  Service Act grants system, as would already  be the case if the District had a matching program. Until 2006 there was no matching program in the District thus making it ineligible to  apply for assistance. This bill is revenue neutral. Adding  the District of Columbia  to  this  program will not have any effect on  federal  funding because the District will be required to  compete  for  the Federal  funds exactly as  every other State competes for the grants.  The  State  Loan  Repayment  Program,  SLRP, was implemented in 1987 in response  to Section 3381 of the Public Health Service  Act, which authorizes the Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  to  make grants to States to help recruit and retain  primary  health  care  professionals  in  HPSAs. Under  the State Loan Repayment  Program,  clinicians  provide  primary  care  health services  in HPSAs  in exchange  for  funds  for  the  repayment of  their qualifying  educational loans. These individuals are fully  trained and licensed primary health care clinicians dedicated  to meeting  the health care  needs of medically underserved communities.  Under the State Loan Repayment Program,  grants are made  to States  to operate  their  own loan repayment programs. Primary care  health professionals who are providing a minimum of 2 years of full-time clinical services in  public or non-profit facilities located in HPSAs  are eligible to apply for a loan repayment. The  State Loan Repayment Program is a collaboration of Federal, State, and community efforts. The Federal Government provides up to  50 percent of the funds to make loan repayment  funds  to primary health care professionals. The remaining 50 percent of the funding comes from State and local community resources.  The District of Columbia has 13.8 percent  underinsured residents compared to 15.7 percent of individuals that are uninsured across  the country. Approximately 17 percent of non-  elderly adults and l0.4 percent of children are  uninsured.  Today, millions of Americans lack access to  health insurance. In 2005, more than 46 million persons were uninsured  for  the entire  year. There are several reasons for the lack of  health coverage for Americans among all uninsured persons under age 65, more than half  were underprivileged and 34 percent  lacked  health coverage.  Improving the health care system is a huge  priority for Congress. The Institute of Medicine  found that the insurance status of parents affects the amount of health care that their children receive. By amending the Public Health  Service Act, this bill would provide eligibility to  the District of Columbia for the State Loan Repayment Program.  It  is extremely  important  that underserved populations have access to  primary health services regardless of their low-  income status. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.  f  SABINOSO WILDERNESS ACT OF  2007  HON. TOM UDALL  OFNEWMEXICO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 7, 2007  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Sabinoso Wilderness Act of 2007. New Mexico is filled with  extraordinary landscapes and, as a representative of this beautiful State, it is an honor to  work  to conserve  these scenic and historic  areas  for  future generations. One of New  Mexico’s special places is the Sabinoso Wilderness Study Area. Last year, I had the opportunity to explore this unique area on horseback. While  traveling  through deep canyons  covered with indigenous trees such as pin˜on-  juniper, cottonwood, willow, and ponderosa  pine, it was evident that Sabinoso is an exceptional setting  that deserves  to be protected  and accessible to all. That is why I am introducing legislation to designate as wilderness  the lands in and near the Sabinoso WSA.  The Sabinoso WSA  comprises  approximately 20,000 acres and  is situated  in San  Miguel County, 40 miles east of Las Vegas,  NM, and 25 miles northwest of Conchas Dam  State Park. Roaming the canyons last year, I  was struck by the ecological, scenic and recreational values of the area. Sabinoso overlays a  thick section of colorful sedimentary  rocks,  typical  of  desert  rock  formations  throughout the West. The area’s scenic and  densely vegetated landscape is also home to  a rich diversity of wildlife, such as red-tailed  hawks, western scrub-jays, broad-tailed hummingbirds, mule  deer,  bobcats,  and  gray  foxes. All of these natural resources will provide outstanding opportunities  to hunt, hike,  horseback ride, take photographs, and simply  experience the unspoiled lands of our ancestors.  During the 2007 session of the New Mexico  State Legislature, House Memorial 53, which  calls on the New Mexico congressional delegation  to support  the establishment of  the  Sabinoso Wilderness Area, was introduced by  State Representative  Thomas Garcia  and  passed unanimously by a vote of 66–0.  Unfortunately, this beautiful piece of land is  currently  inaccessible  to  the general public.  Designating the area will help open it to everyone and provide access to all of these activities. Opening Sabinoso will also create important new economic development opportunities  for  the  surrounding  communities. Madam  Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in  passing  this  legislation  and  creating  the  Sabinoso Wilderness Area so  that everyone  will be able  to experience  its natural and  unique beauty for generations to come.  f  RECOGNITION OF ARNOLD ‘‘NUB’’  PORTERFIELD  HON.

1554,150,2007-06-11,Mr. RAHALL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor  the memory of Arnold G.  ‘‘Nub’’  Porterfield of Bluefield, WV. Arnold was a special and caring man whose commitment to his  community could only be rivaled by his commitment to his family. He was a loving son, a  loving husband, brother, and uncle. He was, in  short, a loving man.  Anyone who knew Arnold, or  ‘‘Nub’’ as  those closest to him referred to him, could not  help but be touched by his generous and caring nature. He took a special interest in the  lives of others, and he often made those lives  a part of his own. He had an uncanny ability  to connect with people,  to make  them  feel  comfortable in his presence. He was a good  friend and a great man.  Arnold was very dedicated  to his country  and his community. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps and served with distinction in both  World War II and the Korean war. He served  the city of Bluefield, WV as a postmaster, a  fireman, and as the chief of police. His commitment  to his  community exemplified  the  motto of the Marine Corps, ‘‘semper fidelis’’,  always faithful.  After retiring from this distinguished career,  Nub dedicated his life to spreading his love of  books and opened the Appalachian Bookstore  in Bluefield.

Sean has been very active with his troop,  participating in many scout activities. Over the  years Sean has been involved in scouting, he  has earned 29 merit badges and held numerous leadership positions, serving as assistant  patrol leader, patrol leader, den chief, and historian. Sean is also a member of the Tribe of  Mic-O-Say and Brotherhood member of  the  Order of the Arrow.  For his Eagle Scout project, Sean painted  house numbers on the street of a local housing division.  Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join  me in commending Sean Tyler Cowden for his  accomplishments with  the Boy Scouts  of  America and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.  f  200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE  TOWN OF CICERO, NEW YORK  HON. JAMES T. WALSH  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 8, 2007  Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Speaker,  I rise today in recognition of the town of Cicero’s 200th anniversary. Located on the southern shore of Oneida Lake, the town of Cicero  serves as a northern suburb of metropolitan  Syracuse. The  town was named after  the  great Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero.  The town of Cicero was one of the townships of the former Central New York Military  Tract. The CNY Military Tract was  land reserved for soldiers who served in the American Revolution. Cicero became a part of the  town of Lysander when Onondaga County  was formed in 1794. The town of Cicero split  from the town of Lysander in 1807. The town  of Cicero also included the town of Clay until  1827 when the township was divided.  The town contains a rich history on involvement within Central New York. The  town of  Cicero was crucial to the building of the Erie  Canal. The construction of the canal brought  many settlers  into  the  town, expanding  its  growth. The town of Cicero was also extensively  involved within  the salt  industry. The  salt industry provided many people with jobs,  either making barrels or in furnishing lumber.  When the salt mines dried up, the town’s residents turned to the agriculture and dairy industries.  Over  its history,  the  town of Cicero has  changed drastically. From a  small  farming  community, Cicero has transformed into one  of the fastest growing suburbs of the region.  It has been an honor for me to represent  the town of Cicero and its citizens for close to  20 years. The town of Cicero has provided the  Central New York region with a prime example  of a successful township filled with great people. The  residents of  the  town of Cicero  should be proud of their rich heritage. I congratulate them as they celebrate their first 200  years, and wish them nothing but the best for  next 200 more.  f  RECOGNIZING  SHANE  DARWIN  POPE  II  FOR ACHIEVING  THE  RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT  HON.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF ROLAND KELLY OF SOUTH BEND,  INDIANA  HON. JOE DONNELLY  OFINDIANA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 11, 2007  ",2007
1558,157,2007-06-11,Mr. DONNELLY.," Madam Speaker,  today  I  rise to honor the life of Roland Kelly, a 16-  year member of  the South Bend Common  Council, World War  II veteran, and beloved  member of the community. Mr. Kelly lost his  battle with a strep infection on May 26, 2007.  Born and raised in Port Chester, New York,  Mr. Kelly enlisted in the United States Navy at  age 17 to serve in WWII. He graduated from  the University of Notre Dame in 1950 and remained in South Bend to work in broadcasting  until 1972. At WSBT–TV, Mr. Kelly served as  the  news  anchor  and  the  news  director.  Though a natural in front of the camera, Mr.  Kelly began a new career at the local bank  where he served as the Vice President and  Director of Marketing, and he would retire as  the  Director  of  Business  Development.  Throughout his  life, he dedicated himself  to  bettering the community through volunteering  and mentoring.  Mr. Kelly was a member of many boards  and committees, but most notably he sat on  the South Bend Common Council as Vice-  President until his death. Described as  the  ‘‘peacemaker’’ by fellow council members, he  sponsored an anti-gun ordinance in 1991 and  was instrumental in including gay, lesbian, bisexual, and  transgender people  in anti-discrimination laws. Mr. Kelly was also influential  in revamping a tax abatement ordinance which  has fostered millions of dollars of new investment in our community. Committees he sat on  included the Information and Technology committee and the Community and Economic Development committee, and he was chairperson  of  the Community Relations committee. For  his dedication to the community, Mr. Kelly was  inducted into the South Bend Community Hall  of Fame in 2001.  Our community has  lost a beloved  family  member, generous friend, devoted father, doting grandfather, and Notre Dame’s most enthusiastic fan. He was described as a ‘‘ham at  heart’’ and was often seen performing in theatre and music groups. Off-stage, Mr. Kelly  never missed an opportunity to share a witty  story.

1559,164,2007-06-11,Mrs. CAPPS.," Madam Speaker, today I rise  to pay tribute to Dr. Manuel (Manny) Lopez as  he celebrates his 80th birthday. Dr. Lopez has  served the Oxnard community as a doctor, an  activist, a community volunteer and as an  elected official. I am pleased to recognize Dr.  Lopez on this special day.  Born in Oxnard in 1927, Dr. Lopez attended  local schools  through high school, attended  Ventura Community College and went on to  attend DC Berkeley  for his undergraduate  education and as a student of optometry. He  returned to his community and has practiced  Optometry in Oxnard since 1962.  Before serving on the Oxnard City Council  for 12 years and then serving as mayor for 14  years, Dr. Lopez was involved with the Oxnard  Planning Commission, the Housing Authority,  the Redevelopment Agency,  the Community  Relations Commission and the Economic Development Commission. While serving as a  Member of  the Council and as mayor, Dr.  Lopez represented  the city on a number of  local and  regional committees dealing with  such issues as transportation planning, wastewater treatment, local airport policy and agricultural land preservation. He has also participated in many community groups such as the  Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic  Chamber of Commerce, the Oxnard Optimist  Club,  the Oxnard Boys and Girls Club and  many others.  As a result of his dedication to his community, Dr. Lopez was  chosen as  the 1991  Oxnard Distinguished Citizen of the Year and,  in 1992, he received the Patrick Henry Award.  In 2006 Dr. Lopez was the Grand Marshal of  the Oxnard Christmas Parade. It is my honor,  Madam Speaker, to recognize and commend  Dr. Manuel Lopez for his ongoing service to  his community on this joyous occasion of his  80th Birthday.  f  IN  CELEBRATION  OF  NATIONAL  MINORITY CANCER AWARENESS  WEEK  HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 11, 2007  ",2007
1560,164,2007-06-11,Mr. RANGEL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to recognize National Minority Cancer Awareness Week. This week of awareness gave us  the opportunity  to highlight  the  issues and  concerns  that minority cancer patients and  their families face on a daily basis. It is important  that we  acknowledge  the  challenges  present for minorities who suffer with cancer  so that we can take the necessary steps to alleviate these barriers.  Cancer patients endure chemotherapy, radiation  therapy, surgical operations and other  forms of medical treatment to fight the numerous types of cancer. The medical community  continues to conduct research to find cures for  cancer and develop more effective ways  to  treat  individuals struggling with  the disease.  Unfortunately these medical advances are out  of reach for many minorities dealing with cancer. The American Cancer Society has documented that the advances in cancer prevention,  early  detection,  and  treatment  has  evaded minority groups:  Minority populations often  face numerous  obstacles receiving equal access  to prevention, early detection, and quality treatment and  tend to receive lower quality health care than  white patients even when insurance status, income, age, and severity of conditions are  comparable.  Racial and ethnic minorities may lack health  insurance, earn  lower  incomes, and experience  language  barriers,  racial  bias,  and  stereotyping which can affect interactions between patients and physicians and contribute  to miscommunication  or  delivery  of  substandard care.  Eighteen percent of African Americans and  35 percent of Hispanic/Latinos are uninsured,  while only 12 percent of whites lack health insurance.  I applaud the American Cancer Society and  the American Cancer Society Cancer Action  Network for bringing national awareness to the  issues faced by minority cancer patients and  for their efforts in celebrating National Minority  Cancer Awareness Week.  IN RECOGNITION OF SERGEANT  BRANDON HADAWAY  HON. MIKE ROGERS  OFALABAMA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 11, 2007  ",2007
1561,164,2007-06-11,Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.," Madam Speaker,  Sergeant Brandon Hadaway, 25, of Valley,  Alabama, died on May 30, 2007, in Afghanistan. Sergeant Hadaway was assigned to the  3rd Battalion, 82nd General Support Aviation  Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division stationed  in  Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  Sergeant Hadaway was serving on his third  tour when his helicopter took fire from enemy  combatants, He was a proud graduate of Valley High School and will be dearly missed in  his community. As a testament to his sacrifice,  the City of Valley has already declared a flag  day in his honor.  Words cannot express the sense of sadness  we have for his family, and for the gratitude  our  country  feels  for  his  service.  Sgt.  Hadaway,  like other brave men and women  who have served in uniform, died serving not  just the United States, but the entire cause of  liberty. Indeed, like those who have served before him, he was a true American.  We will  forever hold him closely  in our  hearts, and remember his sacrifice and that of  his family as a remembrance of his bravery  and willingness  to serve our nation. Thank  you, Madam Speaker, for the House’s remembrance at this mournful occasion.  f  FREEDOM FOR ANTONIO RAMO´N  DI´AZ SA´NCHEZ  HON. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART  OFFLORIDA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 11, 2007  Mr.  LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART  of  Florida.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about  Antonio Ramo´n Dı´az Sa´nchez, a prisoner of  conscience in totalitarian Cuba.  Mr. Dı´az Sa´nchez, an electrician by profession, is a member of the Christian Liberation  Movement and a peaceful pro-democracy activist who desires to exercise his basic human  rights and who supports freedom, democracy  and the Rule of Law for the people of Cuba.  Unfortunately, the nightmare that is the totalitarian regime continues  to oppress  the men  and women of Cuba, especially  those who  work to shed light on the vicious crimes committed against the Cuban people by the tyrant.  In March 2003, as part of the tyrant’s condemnable crackdown on peaceful, pro-democracy activists, Mr. Dı´az Sa´nchez was arrested  simply  for expressing his opinions. Mr. Dı´az  Sa´nchez was subjected to a sham trial where  he was ‘‘sentenced’’ to 20 years of confinement  in  the  infernal  totalitarian dungeons of  the brutal regime.  Mr. Dı´az Sa´nchez has continued  to advocate for freedom and justice while locked in  the hellish squalor of the dictatorship’s gulag.  He has participated in various hunger strikes  to draw attention to the horrific conditions that  political prisoners are  subjected  to  in  the  gulag. He  is  routinely denied medical  treatment although he currently suffers from painful  colitis and has been denied a biopsy for a rapidly growing tumor on his prostrate.

1563,1,2007-06-19,Mr. LAMPSON.," Mr. Speaker, I am  honored to recognize the great work  and contribution of the Society of Iranian-American Women for Education, a  scholarship  fund  in  southeast Texas  that serves the greater academic community. The Society’s mission  is to  promote Iranian culture through educational seminars, films, lectures, and  exhibitions, but their most important  goal is to provide educational support  and assistance through scholarships for  hardworking students. To date, more  than 170 such scholarships have been  awarded to students attending schools  in Texas. The Society is also dedicated  to  strengthening  relationships  and  deepening the understanding between  Iranians  and  Americans,  and  has  hosted many esteemed  speakers,  including Nobel Laureate Dr. Shirin  Ebadi and Anousheh Ansari, who recently completed her own space flight.  I salute the Society for their dedication to academics and achievement,  and wish them future success in all  their wonderful endeavors.  f  RECESS  ",2007

Coughlin, offered the following prayer:  Lord God, in the days of Gideon, out  of fear of the Midianites, Your people  established fire signals on the mountains, caves for refuge and strongholds.  Today, Lord, bless and strengthen all  efforts to build homeland security in  places around the world like Darfur, as  well as here in the United States. To  protect one’s home or homeland seems  paramount  in the Hebrew, Christian  and Muslim scriptures. But, Lord, You  seem to ask even more of Your people.  Let Congress  learn  from Gideon’s  interaction with You, Lord.  When Gideon asks  ‘‘if the Lord  is  with us, why has all this happened to  us?’’ the Lord turns to him and said,  ‘‘Go with the strength you have and  save Israel from the power of Midian.’’  The Scriptures seem to ask for moral  authority in a person as a prerequisite  to being a leader in defense of what is  good and just. Gideon is exhorted to  look first to his personal strength. As  he proves his own moral  integrity,  piety and ability, the Lord’s promise is  realized, ‘‘I am with you.’’  May this Congress and the leaders of  all nations move and act with deeper  faith, knowing the extent and limitations of their strength, both now and  forever. Amen.  f  THE JOURNAL  The SPEAKER. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House  her approval thereof.

1565,8,2007-06-19,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  First of all, let me thank Mr. OBEY,  the chairman of the committee, for his  good work with us on this bill. And I  want to add my support to Chairman  VISCLOSKYon doing a good job on his  first bill, and I will talk about that a  little bit further.  This is the first Energy and Water  appropriation bill that my colleague  from  Indiana  has  developed  and  brought to the floor. The first one, I  found out, is always the hardest one,  but he has done a great job and it is a  good bill; and I have certainly enjoyed  working with him this year in a new  position  for me also as the ranking  member on this bill.  It certainly helps to have an allocation that is $1.1 billion over the administration’s request. However, I do not  disagree with the major funding decision that the chairman has made in  this bill.  This bill  is a very thoughtful approach to some very difficult issues, including investing in our Nation’s water  infrastructure, developing domestic energy sources with less impact on global  climate, and fostering our national security through rational efforts on nuclear  nonproliferation  and  nuclear  weapons.  I want to comment briefly on a couple of specific programs and projects,  including several that Chairman VISCLOSKYhas just recently discussed. I  fully support the  increased spending  for water resources infrastructure. We  have chronically underinvested in this  infrastructure in recent years both in  this administration and,  frankly,  in  the previous administration.  b1100  And the hurricanes of 2005 taught us  some very hard lessons about the consequences of such underinvestment.

There was never a hearing on  this. There was never a vote on this in  the Congress. This whole power  line  issue in corridors, which in this area  will go through Antietam, will include  Gettysburg and First Manassas, will be  coming to your area.  So when given the opportunity if you  look at all the groups that support the  Hinchey amendment, we strongly urge  you to support the Hinchey amendment. On the current language, no environmental impact statement, no consideration of energy efficiency, no consideration of historic lands.  The Hinchey amendment is good for  the country.  ",2007

1572,15,2007-06-19,Mr. SIMPSON.,"  I  tleman for yielding.  Once again this year, the bill before  us is the result of a bipartisan atmosphere in the Energy and Water Subcommittee that has been fostered by  Chairman  and  Ranking  Member HOBSON. I want to thank both  of them for the manner in which they  VISCLOSKY thank  the  genapproached the many issues before this  committee and  for producing a bill  that will pass today, I believe, with little opposition.  First, the Energy and Water bill enjoyed unanimous support in the subcommittee and near unanimous support in the full committee for the balanced and thoughtful way in which it  addresses  the  complex  energy  and  water challenges facing this Nation.  Second, the bill makes tremendous  investments  in our Nation’s critical  science and energy-related programs.  Third, the bill promotes two areas that  I believe are critical to address the energy supply challenges we face, nuclear  and alternative fuels, by employing the  vast knowledge and expertise of our national labs that includes the Idaho National Laboratory which is in my district.  Finally, the bill continues its pressure on DOE to improve project management, contain costs and stick to  schedules which are among DOE’s most  chronic and persistent problems.  In closing, I want to again recognize  the bipartisan manner in which this  bill was written and acknowledge the  tremendous work of all  the professional staff on this subcommittee.  I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and I thank the chairman and the  ranking member for their work on this  bill.  The  CHAIRMAN.  The  gentleman  from Ohio has 45 seconds remaining.  The gentleman from Indiana has 11⁄2  minutes remaining.  ",2007

1574,15,2007-06-19,Mr. HOBSON.," No, but I will yield my  extra 45 seconds to the gentleman from  South Carolina.  The  CHAIRMAN.  The  gentleman  from South Carolina is recognized for  the balance of the time.  ",2007
1575,15,2007-06-19,Mr. SPRATT.," Let me thank both the  chairman and the ranking member for  this gracious yielding of time but, in  addition, for the excellent work they  have done on this bill. As they know,  there is a bone of contention in the bill  where we have had a disagreement. It  is called MOX fuel. I think it’s a good  idea. For some time we’ve had an understanding with  the Russians  that  they and we would build MOX fuel disposition plants so that we could take  weapons grade plutonium and convert  it into reactor fuel, burn it and dispose  of it so it would no longer be usable for  weapons. This bill took the President’s  request of $333 million and basically  cut it in half to 167. But when I sat  down with the chairman, he pointed  out to me that there were prior-year  balances  that would  augment  that  amount of money and, all in all, there  was a total of $698 million available  which would be enough to move the  project forward in the next fiscal year.  Unfortunately, when we explored those  unspent balances, we found that the  numbers were a bit out of date, according to the Department of Energy, and  that the available funds would add up  to only about $326 million, which is  about half of what is needed for the  project next year.  So I rise simply to say that in conference or somewhere along the way  before this  finally becomes  law, we  would  like  to  reengage  about  the  amount of money that is available for  the MOX plant. I’m not offering an  amendment today. I know it would be  defeated. It would also be ingratitude  for the work that the chairman and the  ranking member have already committed to work with us on this project.  But I do say, number one, I appreciate your efforts and, number two,  we’ll visit this number in conference  with the conferees if at all possible.  There are some other issues here, the  H Canyon, there’s $85 million taken out  of  it. It’s the only plutonium processing line of its kind we have operative in the country today. That money  may render it difficult to operate it  through the rest of the year. And there  is also a question of where the pit disassembly process will be located. I understand that has been resolved and  will be resolved with an amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. TAUSCHER).  Let me thank the chairman and the  ranking member for their assistance in  this matter and say that we still have  some work  to do on  the adequate  amount of money  for the MOX  fuel  plant before the bill is ready.  ",2007
1576,15,2007-06-19,Mr. HALL.," Mr. Chairman,  later  today we  begin work on important legislation to finally  help America end its dependence on foreign  oil and pursue newer, cleaner forms of energy.  I’m excited that the Energy and Water Appropriations bill that we will pass this week will  take the long-overdue step of setting a new  course for our energy future by making significant  investments  in  renewab1es  and  efficiency.  For too many years, working families have  felt the sting of high prices at the gas pump  and rising home energy costs. Our economy  has been made vulnerable  to  the whims of  OPEC, and our reliance on  fossil  fuels has  polluted  our  air  and  exacerbated  climate  change.  All  the while state and  local governments  have been forced to try to fill the leadership  vacuum left by the previous Congress and this  President.  No more. The new Congress is prepared to  meet our nation’s energy challenges head on.  To do so, this bill provides almost $2 billion for  renewables and efficiency, significantly more  than the President requested.  This  funding  includes $200 million  to get  more solar projects on the market, $250 million  to help develop domestically produced  biofuels and over $235 million for new vehicle  technologies to alleviate our demand for foreign oil, about $390 million for efficiency and  weatherization grants  to cut energy use  in  buildings, and over $110 million to expand and  develop hydropower across the United States.

1578,22,2007-06-19,Ms. BERKLEY.," Mr. Chairman, I rise  to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, 20 years ago Congress  declared that my home State of Nevada  would become  this Nation’s nuclear  garbage  dump.  The  legislation  is  known in the State of Nevada as the  ‘‘Screw Nevada Bill.’’  Two decades later, the families I represent remain overwhelmingly opposed  to having toxic nuclear waste buried 90  minutes from their homes, businesses,  and where their children play. They  have  seen  the mismanagement  at  Yucca Mountain, the lack of quality  assurance and recent scandals where  workers admitted to having  falsified  work on the site.  Nevada families know that there is  currently no canister capable of storing nuclear waste  for  thousands of  years and that, once inside of Yucca  Mountain,  corrosive  elements  will  cause the canisters that do exist to  rapidly fail, corrode, releasing radioactivity  into  nearby water  supplies.  Moms  and  dads  fear  thousands  of  truckloads of nuclear waste barreling  down the highways of southern Nevada,  home to more than 2 million families  and a destination that attracts more  than 40 million visitors a year. They  have seen over the past 25 years how  promises  for  ‘‘fair  treatment’’  and  ‘‘sound science’’ have been trumped by  raw politics. And in 2002 they watched  as Congress  ignored Nevada’s objections and declared that Yucca Mountain should go forward in spite of serious unresolved scientific  issues that  linger to this very day.  The circuit court of appeals decision  that threw out the 10,000-year EPA radiation standards, there  is a reason  that they threw it out. Currently, no  radiation  standards  exist  for Yucca  Mountain because they would have to  find radiation standards for a 300,000-  year time, leaving most of us to wonder if the financial status of the nuclear industry is more important than  protecting the public safety and lives  of American citizens.  Fortunately, Nevadans are not alone  in opposing Yucca Mountain. Across  this Nation,  communities  that  face  decades of nuclear waste  shipments  have raised their voices in opposition  to Yucca Mountain. They share our  concerns about terrorist attacks or an  accident  involving this  lethal cargo.  One nuclear waste spill could threaten  thousands of lives, shut down rail lines  and highways, and cost millions of dollars to clean up. Who is going to pay  for that cleanup?  Post-9/11 we know all too well that  there are those who will stop at nothing to strike at this Nation. Terrorists  seeking to release radioactive materials or to secure a dirty bomb could  target these waste shipments for attack, making each train or truckload a  disaster waiting to happen. Our communities do not have the resources and  our first responders simply do not have  the training to deal with this threat.  Mr. Chairman, there are more reasons to oppose Yucca Mountain. This  literal hole in the Nevada desert has already cost taxpayers $12 billion, and  the sky is the limit when it comes to  future spending: $100 billion, $200 billion, $300 billion? Nobody can tell us  and nobody knows. The last time the  DOE updated  the  cost analysis  for  Yucca Mountain was 2001. The Department of Energy said in 2006, and again  this year, they will provide updated  cost analysis. They haven’t yet done  that because  they don’t know. The  DOE’s failure to provide us with an up-  to-date life-cycle cost analysis for this  project is just one more reason to oppose  this multibillion  dollar  boondoggle.  And here is another: Yucca Mountain  is even further away today than it was  20 years ago when we first started down  this path. After $12 billion in spending,  Yucca Mountain is now so far behind  schedule that  it will not even open  until 2020 or beyond. Remember, it was  supposed to be 1998. Meanwhile, the  last shipments will not even leave the  nuclear reactor sites until 2047. That is  40 years from today.  Mr. Chairman, we have a better solution. The first step is to keep nuclear  waste where it is now in hardened dry-  cask storage containers that can be secured for the next 100 years. End Yucca  Mountain before we waste another $200  billion to $300 billion. And then,  finally, find a real solution to securing  this Nation’s nuclear waste.  I urge you to vote to cut wasteful  spending at Yucca Mountain, protect 50  million Americans in the communities  all across our Nation who will be in  danger from nuclear waste shipments  and the families who oppose plans to  turn Nevada into a radioactive garbage  dump.  Before I yield back, I want to thank  both Mr. HOBSONand Mr. VISCLOSKYfor  yielding me  this  time.  I appreciate  their courtesy that is of monumental  importance to the people I represent,  the citizens of Nevada, and those who  are  living on  these very dangerous  transportation routes.  The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will read.  The Clerk read as follows:  MISSISSIPPIRIVERANDTRIBUTARIES  For expenses necessary for flood damage  reduction projects and related efforts in the  Mississippi River alluvial valley below Cape  Girardeau, Missouri, as authorized by law,  $278,000,000, to remain available until expended, of which such sums as are necessary  to cover the Federal share of operation and  maintenance costs for inland harbors shall  be derived  from  the Harbor Maintenance  Trust Fund.

1579,22,2007-06-19,Mr. WESTMORELAND.," Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amendment No. 24 offered by Mr. WESTMORELAND:  Page 4, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $18,000,000)’’.  ",2007
1580,22,2007-06-19,Mr. WESTMORELAND.," Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is it  cuts $18 million from the $278 million  authorized under this bill. It is a small  cut. Although $278 million is already  authorized in current law, it is what  the President’s request was; and even  though we have looked at other amendments and, hopefully, the whole House  will see to do some cuts, this appropriations bill is $1.1 billion over the  President’s request. So this $18 million  simply brings back the President’s request  for  the Mississippi River and  Tributaries program.  The Mississippi River and Tributaries  last year was $396.6 million  in 2007.  There has been plenty of money there,  I think, to look at these harbors, look  at the flood damage, look at the things  that should be done there; and this is a  mild decrease of the $18 million.  But let me again reiterate, as I did  on the previous two amendments, that  this is in addition to $105 billion in new  Federal spending over the next 5 years  that has been authorized by the new  leadership in this House. It has been  done by enacting the largest tax increase in American history. And this  budget that we are looking at for 2008  allows $23 billion in new spending that  will be funded by the largest tax increase  in  American  history.  This  amendment, while being only $18 million, is a small dent. I can’t believe  that  I have been  in Congress  long  enough to say ‘‘only $18 million,’’ because that is more money than most  American families will see in one lifetime or two lifetimes. It is just a small  dent in this year’s budget. And, Mr.  Chairman, I hope that all Members will  see their way to cut this amount of  money out of this particular appropriations bill.  ",2007

1582,29,2007-06-19,Mr. HENSARLING.," Mr. Chairman, I  move to strike the last word.  I would like to associate myself with  the comments of the ranking member  of the Budget Committee. What is of  great concern here and why once again  I want to thank the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. WESTMORELAND) for these  series of amendments to at a minimum  look at various spending levels and try  to at  least keep to the President’s  level, which so many of us already consider to be overinflated, particularly  when we look at the fact of how much  more the Federal budget has grown  over the family budget. Since I have  been on the face of the planet, the Federal budget has outgrown the family  budget by a factor of about five to one.  This cannot continue.  And so the gentleman from Georgia  offers  several amendments, all  that  would at least put us on the path to  avoid the Presidential veto and spend  less than what the new Democrat majority, tax-and-spend majority, wants  to do.  Again, I think it’s very important  that we focus on the fact that this is  part of a larger plan that we see unveiled in the budget resolution. This is  our third appropriations bill that puts  us on the course to spend the funds  that will arise from this single largest  tax increase in American history.  Mr. Chairman, for all those who are  watching the proceedings of the House  today, it might be interesting to note  for them that the last time the Democrats had the majority, they enacted  the single largest tax increase in American history. So they are at least consistent in what they are trying to do.  The big debate in Washington is whether you want to tax more and spend  more or whether you want to try to  constrain the growth of the Federal  budget to where the family budget can  actually afford it.  I have heard other speakers rise and  somehow point the  finger at Republicans for fiscal irresponsibility. I must  admit on occasion that perhaps is correct, but, Mr. Chairman, since I have  been here and since I look in the rearview mirror, every time the Republicans have brought a budget to the  floor, the Democrats have brought even  a larger budget to the floor. They have  decried the prescription drug benefit  program of the Republicans for being  overly expensive, but their alternative  cost even more. And now already in  just the first 6 months of this 110th  Congress, we have the Democrats wanting to increase nondefense appropriations by $23 billion of taxpayer money,  we should never forget that it’s the  taxpayers’ money, above what we spent  in 2007. They already added $6 billion to  the omnibus spending bill at the first  of this Congress. They added $17 billion  in nonemergency supplemental spending to the bill that would support our  troops in harm’s way; but as we notice,  as we read the fine print, we discovered  it  included spinach and peanuts and  shrimp and everything else. And now  we also understand that the Democrat  majority has provided new spending on  top of the old spending, $105 billion  over 5 years.  What the Republicans are trying to  do is keep the tax relief that Americans have already been provided, keep  it alive, make  it permanent. Democrats say that we’re not trying to increase taxes on the American people,  although in their budget they have the  single largest tax increase in American  history, they just say, well, we’re just  going to let this tax relief expire. Well,  Mr. Chairman, if you’re a hardworking  individual  in  the Fifth District  of  Texas and you make the same amount  of money this year that you made last  year and your tax bill goes up, now,  that may be called in Washington, DC.  letting tax relief expire, I can assure  you that is a tax increase on hardworking people in the Fifth District of  Texas and all over America.  That’s why when this bill comes to  the floor, and I know there are many  worthy programs in this bill, but we  can never  forget the worthy energy  bills that are in the family budget and  the worthy water bills that are in the  family budget, and you cannot fund the  Federal budget without taking money  from the  family budget. That’s why  again one modest step would be to vote  for  this amendment  from  the gentleman from Georgia, and I once again  want to commend him for his leadership on  fiscal  responsibility  in  this  body.  ",2007
1583,29,2007-06-19,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Chairman,  move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition  to  the gentleman’s amendment and  would note that the gentleman from  Wisconsin in his earlier remarks used  the term  ‘‘slush fund.’’ I would note  that a  slush  fund connotes a  fund  raised by a group for corrupt practices  as bribery or graft. I’m certain that the  gentleman didn’t mean to imply that.  Slush  fund can also mean money  once raised by the sale of garbage from  a warship to buy small items of luxury  for the crew. I’m sure the gentleman  didn’t mean that, either.  A slush fund can also mean a fund  used by a group of office workers for  entertainment, but I don’t think the  gentleman meant that.  A slush fund could also be a fund  raised  for undesignated  purposes.  I  would not be so presumptuous as to  speak  for  the gentleman  from WisI  consin, but I assume that was the import of his remarks, and in this case  that would also be an incorrect assertion.  The subcommittee worked very hard  for the first 6 months of this year to assess what the investment needs are for  the United States of America, its citizens and its economic future. As I have  mentioned earlier, and we had graphics  to support the assertion, we have an  aging  infrastructure  in  the United  States of America. Anyone who is on  the roads, anyone who travels by air,  anyone who travels by rail, anyone  who travels on water understands that.  And today we are particularly concerned about the aging water  infrastructure.  I for one, and I believe all of the  members of the subcommittee, am very  concerned that much of the infrastructure in place as far as operation and  maintenance is past its designed life.  That pertains to almost half of the  locks and dams in this country. We  have not dredged many of our harbors,  whether they be for recreation, which  is an economic purpose as well, or for  commerce to their authorized depths,  let alone to the depths needed to ensure that they can operate effectively  and cost efficiently, and  this work  must be done.  What we have created here is an investment fund for operation and maintenance, and I for one am proud that  we have  increased  in  that account  more moneys to invest in the economic  prosperity of our country, whether it  pertain to navigation channels, locks  and dams, or other water infrastructure.  I would ask my colleagues to oppose  the amendment.  ",2007
1584,29,2007-06-19,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  I rise in opposition to the amendment to reduce funding for the Corps of  Engineers operation and maintenance  account. I confess that I don’t understand this amendment beyond its superficial attempt to reduce bottom-line  spending. This country has already expended billions of dollars in our water  resources infrastructure. Much of that  infrastructure is quite old and needs  major rehab. I would invite any of the  Members around that want to go and  look, go look at the dams and the locks  and the rivers that we have and look at  the aging infrastructure that is there.  As  any  responsible  homeowner  knows, much of critical maintenance is  penny-wise and pound-foolish  if you  put it off. The same maxim applies to  our Nation’s water  resources  infrastructure, though with a much larger  role at stake.  And if we get it wrong, much more  than just dollars are at stake. A large  part of the failures that caused such a  devastating loss of life and property in  New Orleans came from inadequately  maintained flood control projects. We  cannot afford to make this mistake  again.

AMENDMENTOFFEREDBYMR. LAMBORN  ",2007
1586,36,2007-06-19,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Chairman, I offer  an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. LAMBORN:  Page 14, line 18, after the dollar amount insert ‘‘(reduced by $1,236,000)’’.  ",2007
1587,36,2007-06-19,Mr. LAMBORN.," Mr. Chairman, as we  continue to wade through these massive and costly spending bills, my commitment to the American taxpayer remains strong. I signed a pledge to uphold a Presidential veto of any spending bill that exceeds the President’s requested level of funding. Hopefully, we  can contain some of this out-of-control  spending and pass fiscally responsible  legislation; but  if not,  I  intend  to  honor that pledge.  This appropriations bill would  increase spending for energy and water  projects by $1.1 billion more than the  President’s budget request and seeks to  increase spending by more than $1.3  billion over last year’s fiscal 2007 Energy and Water appropriations bill.  We have an opportunity  to demonstrate  restraint  by  reducing  the  amount that the government spends,  not increasing it. At a time when the  Federal Government faces an $8.8 trillion national debt, we have a real opportunity to show the American people  that we can be fiscally disciplined and  that we will reduce this deficit. Increasing the size of government or bureaucracy will not help this reduction  effort.  My commonsense amendment would  simply maintain the Policy and Administration account under the Bureau  of Reclamation at fiscal year 2007 levels, representing a $1.2 million reduction from $58.8 million to $57.6 million.  That is the same as last year’s budget.  Given that this funding level was appropriate for last year’s budget and our  Nation needs to reduce Federal spending, this commonsense restraint should  be acceptable.  This amendment is not critical of the  Bureau of Reclamation or its employees, who actually help deliver water to  parts of my district and are important  to the State of Colorado and to the entire West. It would simply require the  Federal Government  to operate  the  way any deficit-laden business would.  A private sector company experiencing  the same deficits the Federal Government is facing would not increase its  deficit. It would simply cut spending or  go out of business. A family on a tight  budget finds ways to go without, and  we should explore every opportunity to  be fiscally responsible as well.  This amendment is the first step of  many necessary steps enforcing fiscal  discipline and sanity upon the Federal  Government and out-of-control Federal  deficit spending. We must restore fiscal  discipline and assure  the American  people that we are doing whatever is  necessary to reduce our national debt.  To do this, we must find commonsense  and innovative new ways to do more  with less.  The American  people  have  asked  Congress to rein in Federal spending  and tighten its belt. This reasonable  amendment does just that, and I urge  its adoption.  Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. Mr.  Chairman, I move to strike the last  word.  Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor in  support of yet another good and commonsense amendment. Good and common sense because it asks of this Congress to do the very same thing that  any family in America and any small  business  in America would do under  similar circumstances.  The American public right now  is  looking at, as we have already seen,  the largest tax increase in U.S. history.  And  let me  just  take  a moment,  though, before I go into the particulars  on this amendment to explain how that  impacts upon the average American  family.

On page 68, it indicates that the  Nuclear Power 2010, you provide about  $80 million, a decrease of $34 million.  So the question I have for you, if you  support this program so much, why  would you cut it $34 million, which is  basically a huge percentage?  ",2007

1590,43,2007-06-19,Mr. VISCLOSKY.,"  I appreciate  gentleman from Ohio yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to  respond to the question raised. First of  all I would point out that the funds  that are provided are at this year’s fiscal level. It is not a cut. It is a cut  from the President’s request.  The other observation I would make  is I believe that the Department should  be in the business of science research  and development and not exclusively  be paying for companies to license new  reactors, so that would certainly do  justification.  ",2007
1591,43,2007-06-19,Mr. STEARNS.," Then the other question is, in Generation IV, the nuclear  energy system by which you increased  it $80 million, it seems to me, and you  might want to answer this question,  here you have a program that  is a  fourth generation of nuclear research.  We don’t even have the results from  the second and third generation nuclear research, yet you’re increasing a  huge amount of money for something  well into the future when you have a  system, the 2010 energy system, which  could use this money today and would  go towards improving global warming  and put less demand on all these nuclear energy companies because they  certainly can’t meet the demand in the  next 2 years without burning coal and  gas.  So I ask the gentleman, why would  he want to increase something that’s a  fourth generation when the second and  third generation have not even been  successful  in providing anything  for  us?

1594,43,2007-06-19,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," I would point out  that there was a $70 million increase,  and I would not want to engage  in  quibbling as to whether it is a second,  third or fourth generation, but do believe there is a strong public purpose  for demonstrating the commercial viability of the thermal-neutron gas reactor for the very purposes that the gentleman is concerned about and that I  share his  concern,  that  is,  climate  change and global warming and energy  sources, where we can generate the  electricity in this country as well as  potentially  produce  hydrogen.  We  ought to start down that road sooner  rather than later, and again in a balanced fashion along with 2010.  ",2007

Where we need to go is beyond that and look at Gen IV. That’s  what we’re trying to do in the bill now,  and that’s why we oppose the gentleman’s amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN.

1598,43,2007-06-19,Mrs. SCHMIDT.," Mr. Chairman, I have  tremendous respect for our chairman  and ranking member and realize the  very difficult undertaking they have  had in putting this bill together and  balancing the number of important priorities within  it. Unfortunately, the  bill before us would drastically cut the  President’s request to $405 million for  the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, GNEP, initiative to $120 million.  This amounts to a $285 million reduction from the President’s request for  GNEP.  At the same time, this bill goes well  above the President’s request for the  Department of Energy science account.  The President’s request for the science  account was already a 15.8 percent increase above the fiscal 2007 level. On  top of this, the House bill provides another $116 million above the administration’s  request.  My  amendment  would provide an additional $80 million  for the GNEP initiative, offset by an  $80 million decrease in the science account.  If we are going to be serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, addressing climate change and reducing  our dependence on foreign oil, we need  to allow GNEP to proceed in a meaningful capacity. To accomplish these  objectives, we need to diversify our energy supply and increase energy efficiency and conservation. Nuclear energy is a vital component to diversifying our energy supply and reducing  greenhouse gas emissions. And in order  for the nuclear renaissance to become a  reality, we must address the spent fuel  issue, which is what GNEP is all about.  Recycling spent nuclear fuel is a way  to reduce by about 95 percent the volume of waste that would have to be disposed of at the Yucca Mountain repository. Recycling would also enable us to  reduce the radioactive life of this material from millions of years to thousands. Whether you support nuclear energy or not, these two points should be  very positive if we are going to take  better care of our environment.  Since the 1970s, the United States has  been falling behind the world in nuclear technology. It is vital that we  fund this program at a sufficient level  that allows the United States to reestablish itself as a leader in the field.  I appreciate the chairman and ranking member’s work on this important  issue. I would hope for some favorable  comments from them. But I am going  to at the end of this discussion ask for  unanimous consent  to withdraw my  amendment in hopes that we can work  it out at a later date.  ",2007
1599,43,2007-06-19,Mr. VISCLOSKY.," Mr. Chairman,  move to strike the last word.  Mr.  Chairman,  I  appreciate  the  gentlelady’s concern about research for  nuclear energy in the future. I also appreciate the courtesy as far as her willingness to withdraw the amendment.  The concern that the committee had  is  that  the administration came  in  originally with a $405 million request.  During hearings,  the administration  also suggested that all $405 million was  for just research. The concern we have,  and I mentioned it in my opening remarks during general debate, is contract management at the Department  of Energy. And certainly it’s not the  fault of the gentlelady’s, and I know  she shares our concern, but there is a  very bad track record at the Department of Energy; and the fact is they  have been on a high-risk watch list for  the General Accountability Office since  the year 1990.  I  b1600  I would point out that the committee  learned that the Department of Energy’s use of technology readiness levels  in the global nuclear energy partnership technology development plan does  not apply readiness in the manner consistent with the recommendations in  the General Accountability Office report of March of this year.  So, looking ahead as far as potentially incurring huge long-term costs  on behalf of the taxpayers, we have  suggested that the administration take  a step back, continue to do very necessary and very vital research, but let  us take all deliberate speed as opposed  to a rush to judgment and oppose her  amendment, and I appreciate her consideration in withdrawing it.  ",2007
1600,43,2007-06-19,Mrs. SCHMIDT.," Mr. Chairman, I ask  unanimous consent to withdraw the  amendment, and I thank the chairman  for his time and consideration of this  and hope that we can work together to  make GNEP a reality in a meaningful,  bipartisan way  so  that  the United  States can continue to be a world leader, not just in nuclear energy but in energy independence from foreign oil.

1602,50,2007-06-19,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  opposition to the gentleman from Nevada’s amendment, as he might expect  and as his colleague might expect.  At some point we all have to go beyond parochial politics and do  the  right thing for the entire Nation. This  is a NIMBY approach: ‘‘not in my backyard.’’ Under any scenario you might  imagine, from the construction of new  nuclear power plants to shutting down  all existing plants tomorrow, from continuing with the once-through fuel to  cycle to beginning to recycle our spent  nuclear fuel, we will need the first repository at Yucca Mountain. If we pursue recycling, we can avoid the need to  build eight more Yucca Mountains, but  we still need that first repository.  The Federal Government has a statutory and contractual obligation, already adjudicated in the courts. It is  costing us money by not getting  it  operational on Yucca Mountain.  But  this  is not  solely a question  about what  to do with commercial  spent fuel. One-tenth of Yucca’s capacity by weight, and up to one-third of its  capacity by volume, is dedicated to defense spent fuel and high-level waste.  Without Yucca Mountain this material will stay put in places like Hanford, Idaho, Savannah River, and West  Valley. Many of these sites already  have enforceable cleanup agreements  requiring these materials to be shipped  off to the geologic repository.  I would like to think we don’t need a  repository, but we do need a repository. We need it now, not 100 years. We  need to move forward with this. And  my real desire is that we won’t have to  build eight of them someplace and certainly not in Nevada. But we have got  to finish this one off. It is a waste of  taxpayers’ money not to do it.  I urge opposition to this amendment.  ",2007

They have spent 20  years in a rush. And in the midst of  that time, we have created a project  that is a colossal waste of taxpayers’  is  in my disdollars. We need to find a site that is  safe.  I support nuclear energy. I do not  support the waste being in Nevada because it is absolutely broken.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate this time  and encourage this Congress to stop  the funding of this very flawed project  and  find a site that  is safe  for the  American people.  ",2007
1604,50,2007-06-19,Mr. HELLER of Nevada.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise today in strong support of the Porter-Heller-Berkley amendment  to  the Energy and  Water Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008.  This amendment would strike the funding for  the proposed Yucca Mountain site, and help  end  this enormous  financial disaster  for  the  taxpayers and for Nevada.  Colleagues, Yucca Mountain  trict, Nevada’s Second District.  Our State has been dealing with this issue  for literally decades, the Federal Government  has spent billions of dollars, and we are frankly almost no closer today to opening this site  than we were years ago.  As has been stated by my Nevada colleagues, over the past 20 years the proposed  site has suffered from gross mismanagement,  faulty science and research, and contract mismanagement.  But we aren’t just opposed to this site in an  arbitrary manner.  In  fact, a number of solutions exist that are acceptable and safer, like  dry-cask storage for example.  If you’re opposed to nuclear waste traveling  through your communities, creating safety and  security hazards in your neighborhoods, then  you should support this amendment.  If you’re concerned about  the  taxpayers,  wasting their funds, and the wise stewardship  of  Federal  tax  dollars,  then  support  this  amendment.  Both Senators, the Governor and the House  delegation are united in opposition to Yucca  Mountain. That should send a very clear message to us here in the House about the opposition in Nevada.

That was designed to help a  vast array of  technologies  such as  wind, solar, clean coal, ethanol, and  nuclear. Your committee excluded new  nuclear plants as one of  the  technologies eligible  for  loan guarantees  under the 2005 Energy Policy Act. And  as a supporter of nuclear power, I oppose that exclusion. I am concerned  that this may delay new projects that  are being planned, and I am hopeful  that these concerns can be addressed  when you reach a conference with the  Senate.  I would also note that the authorization in the energy appropriation bill is  just that, an authorization. No appropriation is required.

1613,64,2007-06-19,Mr. RUSH.," Mr. Speaker, I stand here  today, along with my congressional  Black Caucus colleagues,  in recognition of Juneteenth Day. It is fitting for  us to not only acknowledge where we  have been in the past but also to evaluate where we are today as a people.  Mr. Speaker, one of the most pressing  issues  in  the African American  community remains the issue of education. Many of my colleagues have  outlined  the progress and  the challenges  that many African American  students face as they strive to acquire  the  educational benefits  that  every  American should receive.  In the words of the great African  American  leader Malcolm X:  ‘‘Education is the passport to the future, for  tomorrow belongs to those who prepare  for it today.’’  Education is, of course, the key to a  bright future. And it is the vital ingredient in finding success and achieving  the American Dream. While African  Americans have come very far, educationally, there is still much work to do  at the Federal, at the State, at the  local, and at the family level to ensure  that all of our students are learning  and are being given the chance to succeed.  Today, Mr. Speaker, African American females, in particular, are achieving gains in education that were previously unheard of. Black females are  graduating  from  college,  graduate  school, and post-graduate  school at  record levels. And this is something we  can all be proud of and take comfort in.  However, Mr. Speaker, there are still  many problems. Today, our Nation has  more African American men in prison  than in college. In many urban cities,  Black males are dropping out of high  school at a rate of 50 percent and even  less are going to college.  One problem that many of our young  students face is the issue of gun violence that pervades our community.  Mr. Speaker, we have to make the  schools and the neighborhoods that we  live in safe for our students. We must  address the gun violence that is plaguing so many of our communities.  African American males under age 30  are nearly nine times more likely to be  murdered than a white male under age  30. African Americans make up only 13  percent of the population of our Nation  but in 2001 suffered almost 25 percent of  all firearms deaths, and 52 percent of  all firearm homicides.  Mr. Speaker, just days ago, on May  10, a student, Blair Holt, was riding  home from school on a public bus and  was fatally shot while trying to shield  a young female friend from a gunman’s  bullet. Blair Holt was an honor student  with plans to attend college, and instead, his young life was prematurely  taken for no reason at all. Mr. Speaker,  this school year alone, 31 Chicago public  school  students have been murdered; 31 students have lost their lives;  31 students have not given their talents, their skills, and their abilities to  make this world a better place.  While this statistic is true for the  schools in my district, gun violence is  all around. Gun violence is prevalent in  so many of the communities all around  this Nation. And we must put an end to  this domestic  terrorism  that  is destroying communities and making our  constituents live in fear. As elected officials,  it  is  incumbent upon us  to  enact legislation that would help reduce the flow of guns into our communities and help our struggling and frustrated  law enforcement departments  all across this Nation to keep track of  those who  possess  guns  and where  those guns are.  I have introduced H.R. 2666, Blair’s  bill, which would implement a Federal  gun  licensing and  registry program.  This bill will help  law enforcement  track over 200 million guns that are  too often ending up in the hands of  criminals,  young  people,  and  gang  members.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2666 is a step in the  right direction. We must do all that we  can for our Nation’s children.  f  ",2007

1618,78,2007-06-19,Mr. HATCH.," Madam President, later  today a great injustice is going to be  hoisted upon the American people, and  a great shame about this injustice is  that a great many Americans won’t  even hear about it. If our friends on the  other side—if their plans hold,  later  today they will call up H.R. 800, the  horribly misnamed  Employee  Free  Choice Act, which would deny workers  all over this great country their right  to cast a private ballot when choosing  whether to join a union. I find it pathetic that at a time when our Nation  is at war, every day additional illegal  immigrants enter our borders, and energy prices are at  their peak, our  friends on the other side are turning  away from the important business the  American people sent us here to do and  are instead insisting on spending the  next couple of days paying back their  union cronies.  If I am not mistaken, I recall reading  that the energy package is the ‘‘second  highest  legislative priority’’  for our  friends on the other side in the Senate.  I guess that means that because we are  interrupting that ‘‘high’’ priority, paying back the unions must be their very  first priority.  Much has already been said about the  denial of a National Labor Relations  Board-supervised and protected secret  ballot  election,  a  private  vote  on  whether employees want  to be  represented by a union. It seems to me  that the Democrats’ and the unions’  real objection to private ballot elections is not the form of vote, a secret  ballot versus card check; their real objection is ever since the 1947 Taft-Hartley amendments, the law allows employers to communicate with their employees  about  union  organization.  What unions really want is to silence  the employer during a union organizing  campaign through a card check process. Then the union would be able to  persuade or even intimidate the employees so the union can be certified  based on a card check as soon as the  union gets to a majority, no matter  how ephemeral that support really is.  What that means is that if the union  gets 50 percent plus one talking to the  employees, then that company automatically becomes unionized without a  secret ballot election. But it is even  worse than that. The way they have  drafted this bill, it will lead to mandatory arbitration, which will result in  the Government setting the terms and  conditions of employment, even pension plans. That is even worse than the  card check aspect, which is about as  bad as it gets. The real key for the  unions is that the process be within the  union’s control and before  the employer has an opportunity to communicate with the employees. In effect,  the unions want to force employer neutrality based on the employer’s inability to respond to a union organizing  campaign.  How quick must the quick certification process be to satisfy unions?  NLRB statistics reveal that in 2006, 94.2  percent of all  initial  representation  elections were  conducted within  56  days of the filing of the petition with  the NLRB and that the median time  was 39 days. Apparently for union organizers, a little over a month is too long  for them to maintain majority support,  although it is important to note that  under the current secret ballot election  procedures, unions still win about 60  percent of all elections. That is fine as  long as there is a balance in these programs, as long as both sides are treated  fairly.  Also union authorization cards make  it virtually impossible for employees  to change their minds, which can happen in the privacy of the voting booth.  Revoking a signed union authorization  card  is  virtually  impossible  today,  when cards are used to trigger NLRB-  supervised elections. You can imagine  how hard it would be for an employee  to revoke a signed card under a card  check process.  The U.S. Supreme Court has  said  that union authorization cards are ‘‘inherently unreliable’’ indicators of employee  support. Even unions  themselves have stated that union authorization cards are  less  reliable  than  NLRB-protected  private  ballot  elections. But the real reason unions seek  card check is not because it is more reliable but because it can be controlled  entirely by the union before the employer can address the union campaign  propaganda. What that really means is  that employees will be denied an informed choice.  Under current law, to convince employees to vote for a union, the union  may use the pressures of the employee  polls and  interrogation. Unions may  make predictions. They may promise  benefits, whether achievable or not,  and they may make false statements  about the employer. It may well be  that the labor leaders have never been  able to negotiate the wages and benefits they promise will result from the  formation of a new union. It may be  that the union, in fact, has negotiated  contracts with other employers in the  same  industry  and  geographic  area  that are less generous than the employees currently receive at the location  being  organized.  The  union’s  claims about  the  employer’s  safety  record,  its compliance with employment laws, its business practices, its  executive  compensation,  its  future  business plans, and so forth are grossly  exaggerated. If we silence employers,  who is going to inform the employees  of these facts? Certainly not the union.  Of course, employees may know well  that in general their employer would  prefer not deal with a union, but if, as  a result of card check, employers are  prevented from responding to a union’s  campaign misstatements, who will?  That is not a license for an employer  to threaten, intimidate, or coerce employees during an organizing campaign.  Under current law, employers are not  permitted to threaten, coerce, or promise new  benefits  or  threaten withdrawal of existing benefits. But under  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:10 Jun 20, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G19JN6.002 S19JNPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 6 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l i t s k c o t s m         ",2007

June 19 is an ordinary day for many  Americans,  is a  significant day  for  those  who  know  its  history.  Juneteenth  Independence Day  celebrates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers led by MG Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, TX, with news that  the Civil War had ended and that the  enslaved were free.  Americans across the United States  continue the tradition of celebrating  Juneteenth Independence Day as inspiration and encouragement for future  generations.  The legislation recognizes the significance of Juneteenth Independence Day  and supports its continued celebration  as an opportunity for the people of the  United States to learn more about the  past and to understand more fully the  experiences that have shaped our nation.  As Americans, we must remember  the  lessons  learned  from  slavery.  Juneteenth is a day that all Americans, of all races, creeds, and ethnic  backgrounds,  can  celebrate  freedom  and the end of slavery in the United  States.  I am pleased to recognize historic  Juneteenth  Independence  Day  and  proud that the Senate has passed this  important resolution.  ",2007

1629,92,2007-06-19,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, this is  the right subject, this issue of alternative fuels. I commend all my colleagues for being here to talk about  this important issue.  I have mentioned often on the floor  of the Senate, we live on this little  planet of ours, and on this planet we  circle the Sun, and we happen to live  on a little patch on this planet called  the United States of America. A substantial amount of oil is used here. We  use one-fourth of all the oil that is  pulled out of this planet every single  day. About 84 million gallons of fuel is  pulled out of this planet every day, and  we use one-fourth of it in this country.  Unfortunately, much  of  the  resources—the oil resources—exist elsewhere. Over 60 percent of that which  we use in oil comes from off our shores,  much of it from very troubled parts of  the world: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Venezuela, Iraq, Iran, and so on. In a circumstance where we have such a prodigious appetite for energy—oil in this  case—and so much of it exists off our  shores, it makes us very vulnerable—  extraordinarily vulnerable.  If tomorrow, God  forbid, terrorists  should  somehow  interfere with  the  pipeline of oil to the United States of  America, we would be flat on our back.  Our economy would be flat on its back  because we get up every single morning  in this country and we pull the switch,  we start the engine, we do all these  things  that heat  the water  for  the  shower and air-condition our home. We  have such an unbelievable appetite for  energy.  With respect to oil itself, we are held  hostage by having so much of it coming from off our shores. Therefore, the  question is, how do we become less dependent or how do we become  independent of the Saudis or the Kuwaitis  or others who have so much oil?  Is it a good thing for us to try to become independent? I think it is. So how  do you do that? Well, you do that in a  lot of ways, one of which—an important ‘‘one of which’’—is to develop renewable alternative fuels.  So we are talking about the biofuels.  We are talking about ethanol. We are  talking about a lot of different issues—  cellulosic ethanol. Today on the floor  of the Senate, we now talk about coal  to liquid. Coal to liquid means taking  coal and producing from it diesel fuel.  That coal to diesel is another way of  producing alternative fuels.  It is very important, however, for us,  as we proceed down this road, to do  this the right way. There is, perhaps,  an easy way and a harder way to do it  or a right way and a wrong way to do  it, but all of us who come here talking  about alternative  fuels, I think, are  talking about the right subject.  This issue of coal is very important.  Coal  is the most abundant resource  that exists in this country. It is our  most abundant. It is our most secure.  It is here. It is the lowest cost American resource. It is estimated we have  over 600 billion barrels of oil equivalent  in coal. Compare that, for example, to  the largest oil reserves in the world,  which are held by the Saudis, estimated at about 260 billion barrels of  oil. Again, the Saudis have the largest  repository of oil we know of, estimated  at about 260 billion barrels. Our coal  has an oil equivalent of about 600 billion barrels.  Well, the question is: How do we use  coal? Because coal has a carbon footprint, it has an impact on our environment. I am chairing the Energy and  Water Subcommittee  on Appropriations. In the accounts I am now working on with my colleagues, I am going  to put a great deal of money into clean  power and into clean coal technology  so we can unlock the mysteries and  find ways to continue to use our coal,  our most abundant resource, without  in any way injuring our environment. I  believe we can do that. I am going to  tell you in a minute an example in  North Dakota that is occurring that  holds great promise, in my judgment.  But we have a lot of experience in  burning coal for electric generation to  produce electricity. We have a good understanding of the challenges we face  as a result of that with respect to carbon reduction in those plants, the coal-  fired  electric generating plants. We  also have some experience turning coal  into synthetic natural gas. The only  plant in the United States in which lignite coal is taken out of the ground—  coal is extracted from the ground and  put in a processing plant to turn coal  into synthetic natural gas the only circumstance in the country where that  occurs is on the prairies of North Dakota. It is interesting that the coal  gasification facility is really a technical marvel—a technological marvel, I  should say. It is producing synthetic  gas in a way that is exceeding expectations. It produces very valuable byproducts, and it does, in fact, produce  CO2.  So  in this coal gasification plant,  with the production of CO2, which we  don’t want to admit in great quantities  into the atmosphere because of climate  change, we have done something that  is really pretty interesting. We capture  5,500 tons a day of CO2 in that plant,  put it in a pipe, and in that pipeline it  is transported 205 miles north into Canada, where  it  is  invested  into  the  ground in Canadian oil wells to make  marginal oil wells more productive. So  we have beneficial use of sequestration  of CO2by piping it to Canada and investing it into the ground to essentially make their oil wells more productive. It has sequestered about 7 million tons of CO2into the Weyburn Field  since the start of the project in the  year 2000. It has doubled the field’s oil  recovery rate and extended the life of  the oilfield by 15 to 20 years. So you  talk about beneficial use of CO2—first  of all, capturing it, keeping it from escaping into the atmosphere, and second, using it for beneficial use. I think  this is the largest example—the largest  demonstration of that—in the entire  world.  Now, the question before us today  will be a couple of different presentations on coal to liquid. I support coal  to liquid. I believe it is part of an alternative fuel strategy that makes sense  for this country. But we come to an  intersection with energy and climate  change, energy and the environment. It  is an intersection a lot of people would  prefer not to approach, but nonetheless  we are there. We can’t pretend one  doesn’t exist. They both exist. They coexist. They have an impact on each  other. The question of how we do coal  to liquids is a very important question  in the context of how we continue to  use our abundant coal resource.  Some say the most beneficial use of  coal is coal to synthetic natural gas. I  have just described how that is being  done. Some say another beneficial use  of coal is coal to plastics. There are  many ways and many approaches to  use coal for beneficial use at the same  time as we protect the environment.  We have examples  in amendments  being offered today of the requirement  of not only  life-cycle  reductions  in  emissions—and I believe both of the  amendments have equivalent life-cycle  reductions in emissions, but only one  has  a  carbon  capture  requirement,  which I think, frankly, is going to be  required as we move forward with coal  to  liquids. We might debate about  where that carbon capture requirement  ought to be established, under what  conditions can it be met, but I don’t  think there is much choice that we, as  we proceed with coal to liquids, establish a carbon capture standard. I believe the Tester amendment does that  in a way that says, I think for many of  us, we fully support coal to liquids. We  also  support all of  the other  technologies that provide for the beneficial  use of coal, which includes, as I have  just described, coal to plastics and coal  to synthetic natural gas, and so on.  But as we proceed with coal to liquids,  it is very important that we capture  and sequester CO2, just as we do in  North Dakota with this synthetic natural gas plant.  Let me also point out that we have  other ways of using coal—biomass co-  fed with coal to produce liquids. We  can actually take CO2 out of the atmosphere with that process. The plants  would capture the CO2 as they grow,  and that CO2would be captured in the  gasification process, along with  the  CO2 from the coal. So it could be permanently  sequestered  in  that  circumstance. As a result, the overall carbon footprint for coal biomass to liquids would be better, for example, than  with petroleum.  So there are so many different applications and different ways that I believe coal can play a very important  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:35 Jun 20, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G19JN6.022 S19JNPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 6 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l i t s k c o t s m         ",2007

1632,99,2007-06-19,Mr. TESTER.," I  just want to talk  about my amendment, 1614, as long as  we have time to do that, very quickly  recap it because I think it is important  that we know the facts.  First of all, we have enough coal in  this country, if it is used at the current  rate, to last us for 250 years. We need  to develop it responsibly. This amendment for coal to liquids will develop it  responsibly. What it does is it provides  grants and loans for clean coal technology. Let me tell you the parameters  because some folks have said this can’t  be achieved.  In front of the Senate Finance Committee, it was testified that it is entirely capable, with the technology we  have today, to have 85 percent carbon  capture. This amendment requires 75  percent carbon capture.  The National Mining Association  said that with coal to liquids, adding  some biomass with the coal, we could  achieve 46 percent  less  in  life cycle  greenhouse gases than comparable petroleum—46 percent less. This amendment  requires  20 percent  less. This  amendment is entirely doable by the  industry. If we want to develop our  coal resources in a manner that meets  the needs of consumers as well as being  able to develop our coal resources in a  responsible way that would not trash  the environment when climate change  is such a huge issue in the world, we  need  to  step  forth  and  adopt  this  amendment.  I could go into the amendment further and talk about the potential of replacing foreign oil. I could talk about  how it is a win-win situation for the  country overall, as far as achieving energy independence, as we push this bill  forward  that deals with  renewables  such as biofuels and wind and solar and  geothermal. The  fact  is, with  this  amendment there are no bogeymen. It  is achievable by the industry, and it  should be adopted if we are going to  lead this country down the road of energy  independence, a road that will  allow the climate change issue to be  put to bed.  By the way, if we pass this amendment, I fully believe, with the two powerplants a month China is putting on  board at 500 megawatts each, we can  also help lead China down a road to  clean coal technology.  I would appreciate a ‘‘yes’’ vote on  amendment 1614.  I yield the floor.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mrs.  MCCASKILL). The Republican leader.  ",2007
1633,99,2007-06-19,Mr. MCCONNELL.," Madam President,  I rise to speak in support of my good  friend  from  Kentucky,  Senator  BUNNING, and his amendment with the  Senator from New Mexico to establish  a program to help support and promote  clean  coal-to-liquid  fuels.  Focusing  more on coal-to-liquid fuels will benefit our economy and our national security. Coal is a vital part of America’s  energy production, and coal is a vital  part of Kentucky’s economy and history. The coal industry creates over  60,000 jobs in my State, including approximately 15,000 coal miners. Over  half the country’s electricity is generated by coal, and coal constitutes  over 90 percent of America’s fossil fuel  resources. That means the coal we can  mine in this country alone would be  enough to supply our Nation for more  than 250 years. What Saudi Arabia is to  oil, America is to coal. Therefore, it  would be  irresponsible of us, not to  mention downright foolish, not to invest in technology to take advantage  of this vital natural resource. That is  why  I  thank my  friend  Senator  for his  leadership on  this  BUNNING issue.  Greater use of coal-to-liquid  fuels  will benefit the environment by reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrous  oxide, particulate matter, and other  pollutants as compared to conventional  fuels. The Bunning amendment also requires that coal-to-liquid fuels under  this program  reduce greenhouse gas  emissions by 20 percent relative to gasoline. Greater  use  of  coal-to-liquid  fuels, which we can generate here at  home, will mean  less dependence on  foreign sources of oil. Right now America gets 60 percent of its oil from foreign countries, many of which do not  have our best interests at heart, as we  certainly know. Passing this amendment will mean greater energy independence and strengthened national security. I commend my good friend and  fellow Senator JIMBUNNING, as well as  Senator DOMENICI. Senator BUNNING  has been hard at work on this issue for  a lengthy time. I thank him for his  dedication to the coal producers and  miners of Kentucky and America. This  amendment is the right thing to do for  them, for our economy, and for our national security.  I urge my colleagues to support it.  I yield the floor.  ",2007

I am proud to stand with him as he  stands up for Maryland and also stands  up for the fact that when we are talking about the siting of an LNG facility,  those who are the most affected should  have the most to say, which means the  State in which it is being located. I  support this amendment because it is  also the right public policy and because  it is the right public policy for Maryland.  I am absolutely opposed to a new  LNG facility in Sparrows Point, MD.  As the senior Senator from Maryland, I  will do all I can to protect the people of  Baltimore and to protect the Port of  Baltimore. I oppose this LNG facility  because of my fears and frustrations. I  worry about a terrorist attack. I worry  about an accident with ghoulish consequences. This is a national security  issue and a community security issue,  not just an energy or a budget issue.  thank my  colThese concerns are not mine alone.  According to a GAO report, scientists  and engineers have raised enormous  concern about the potential hazard of  an accident or an attack on LNG facilities. GAO says we don’t know about  the impact of an LNG accident on public safety. We are talking about possible injury and death. How can anyone  make a decision on LNG without knowing the decision on public safety?  This is why I support this amendment. This amendment gives States  and communities a stronger voice by  making sure the Army Corps of Engineers gets the approval of the affected  State before giving permits  for construction  for an LNG  facility. That  means the Governor can say: ‘‘Hold on  a minute;  this  is not good  for my  State,’’ or,  ‘‘Hold on a minute; it is  good for my State.’’  We  cannot  let  a Federal  agency  rubberstamp plans for an LNG facility.  I am committed to promoting America’s energy independence, but it must  not compromise our national security  or our neighborhood security. I want to  make sure we know the consequence of  what happens when an LNG  facility  comes to a geographic area. What can  be done and should be done to review  and control the plants, the docks, the  ships, the crews?  I do not want permits issued and foreign-flagged  tankers  coming  to our  ports until we know key answers. I do  not want permits authored by Federal  agencies when our States are adamantly opposed and they are not involved in the decision making. Many  States will welcome it. Some States  will raise questions as we have.  It is my responsibility as a Senator  to make sure we ask the right questions to protect the American people.  But, most of all, we want to give the  people most affected something to say.  We worry about this second LNG facility in Sparrows Point. It is 50 miles  up the Chesapeake Bay. These tankers  will have to pass under the Bay Bridge.  My Governor is worried about the impact on the Port of Baltimore, and the  people are worried about the impact on  the community.  My colleague says we have another  facility, and it was in the right place.  Well, I am not sure it was in the right  place. They built this LNG facility 3  miles  away  from  a nuclear  powerplant—3 miles away  from a nuclear  powerplant—but it got closed in the  1980s when the market went down. But  guess what. FERC issued a permit to  reopen Cove Point in a different part of  the State 1 month after 9/11, and they  did not ask about security concerns. It  took this Senator—and then my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, and I—demanding the Department of Homeland  Security get involved, demanding the  Nuclear Regulatory  Commission  to  say: Is it OK to have an LNG facility  down the street? I had to force the  Coast Guard to look at it from a security standpoint rather than just an environmental standpoint.  (Mr.  I worry about the rockfish in the bay,  but I worry about the people who eat  the rockfish in the bay, meaning my  constituents. We  finally got the reviews we needed and we moved ahead  with the permit. Let me tell you, I am  on the side of safety, and I believe the  safest thing is to make sure the Governor has a chance to comment with  the Corps and to have an expressed impact on this permit facility.  I think the Senator’s policy is a wise  one; it is a prudent one. It is narrowly  crafted. I ask my colleagues to adopt  the amendment.  I yield the floor.  The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  SALAZAR).

1653,106,2007-06-19,Mr. DOMENICI.," Well, I want to take  5 minutes and yield the rest of it to  Senator BINGAMAN. But I do want to  make a point that this country is going  to need large amounts of natural gas  over the next 15, 20, 30 years. One  source is probably going to be LNG,  liquefied natural gas. It is terribly important for our country that we have  this available when we need it, and if  the price is right that we be able to locate sites that serve the United States.  Now, frankly, when we passed the Energy Policy Act, there were three or  four things that were very much on the  minds of those who wanted to deliver  energy to the United States. I say to  my new friend, the new Senator from  Maryland, one of those at that particular time happened to be liquefied  natural gas and those around the world  who were trying to figure out whether  the United States was going to be a  place where they could sell liquefied  natural gas or was it going to be a  place where they could be held up forever.  We had  to decide, as we worked  through this very gigantic, gargantuan  bill, what we were going to do about  the concern on the part of the LNG  market that if you left the law as it  was,  every State’s Governor would  have a veto power, and in some instances mayors would have veto power  over an LNG site. We decided that  would not work.  Now, we did not take away everyone’s power. As a matter of fact, we encouraged cooperation. We encouraged  the involvement of the States and the  local governments with the LNG company, and we said only when you get to  the  point where you  cannot  reach  agreement does the Federal Government step in, and then they backstop it  and make a determination,  through  FERC, what is in the interest of our  Nation, what is fair, and what is right.  Frankly, I don’t know the facts about  the Maryland plant, and I do not believe we need to know them on the  floor of the Senate, nor do the Senators.

1655,113,2007-06-19,Ms. MURKOWSKI.," Mr. President, I  rise this evening to acknowledge the  30th anniversary of the first drop of oil  passing through the Trans-Alaska Oil  Pipeline. This is truly an engineering  marvel which is a central component of  the transportation of oil from the largest single domestic source in America’s  history—Prudhoe Bay—to the rest of  the United States, where it powers industry and provides jobs to this day.  Alaska has been called a lot of different things, some not too complimentary, unfortunately. You may remember the term  ‘‘Seward’s  folly.’’ This  was after the United States approved  the purchase of Alaska from Russia in  1867 which got the State of Alaska, the  territory,  for $7.2 million.  ‘‘Seward’s  folly’’ was a reference to Secretary of  State William Seward, who was an advocate for the purchase.  Alaskans themselves dubbed it ‘‘Seward’s icebox,’’ reflecting the sentiment  Americans had toward our supposedly  barren, dark, ice-covered land. But we  soon recognized there was  far more  than just dark, barren, empty land. It  was not an icebox but instead a lush,  resource-rich, and stunningly beautiful  land.  Gold was discovered in the 1890s, and  black gold, or oil, was discovered about  75 years later. While oil is often viewed  in a negative context these days, the  fact remains that this black gold has  enabled America to grow into the economic power it is today.

The  Anaheim Ducks demonstrated remarkable skill, teamwork, and determination in becoming the first California  hockey team to win the prestigious  Stanley Cup.  The 2006 to 2007 season will be remembered as a truly landmark season  for the Anaheim Ducks. During the  course of the season, the Ducks played  in the franchise’s 1000th regular season  game and recorded their 1000th point  after a much-deserved 4 to 2 victory on  March 11, 2007. The Ducks began their  season in fine form as they set an NHL  record by remaining undefeated in regulation play for the first 16 games of  the season. The Ducks used a high-octane offense and a stout defense to  achieve the first 100-point season and  the first Pacific Division title in the  franchise’s  history. Throughout  the  season, the Ducks were a model of hard  work, dedication and consistency.  Under the leadership of a dedicated  management and coaching staff and  with  contributions  from  an  outstanding roster of seasoned veterans  and  promising  young  players,  the  Ducks defeated the Minnesota Wild,  the Vancouver Canucks, and the Detroit Red Wings in their usual spirited  fashion en route to winning the Western Conference title. In the finals, the  Ducks triumphed over the Ottawa Senators in a fiercely contested series that  ensured the oldest and most  famous  trophy in all of North American professional sports, the Stanley Cup, will finally make its way to California for  the first time.  It is my pleasure to congratulate all  the  hard working members  of  the  Ducks organization who worked tirelessly to bring so much joy and pride to  the people of Orange County and to the  State of California. Their successes are  considerable, and I salute their accomplishments. As the Anaheim Ducks and  their fans celebrate their first Stanley  Cup victory, I congratulate them on a  truly remarkable and memorable season and wish them more success in future seasons.∑  125TH ANNIVERSARY OF LAMOURE  ∑",2007
1657,120,2007-06-19,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, it was  125 years ago that pioneers created the  city of LaMoure, ND.  LaMoure and its surrounding territory got off to an unexpectedly strong  start due to the work of a fellow named  MAJ H.T. Elliott. He was employed by  a real estate firm whose financial fortunes depended upon  the prosperity  and success of homesteaders and town  builders in the LaMoure area.  To ensure that region boomed, Major  Elliott was sent to the nearest railroad  station to meet incoming emigrants. If  they  appeared  to be  bright,  industrious, honest folks with adequate financial  resources,  Elliott  directed  them to the region around LaMoure.  But if they were of a suspect type, Elliott sent them off in the opposite direction.  Elliott himself was the county’s first  citizen but had the misfortune to establish the town of Grand Rapids which  immediately  found  itself  in a  fight  with LaMoure over which should be the  county seat. When Grand Rapids lost  that  election,  LaMoure’s  citizens  armed themselves and trooped across  country in the dead of night to seize  the governmental records.  They were met at Grand Rapids by  barricaded doors and  rifles bristling  from the courthouse windows. But with  the  aid  of  a  battering  ram,  they  smashed their way in and the Grand  Rapids  defenders  slipped  away.  LaMoure had its first triumph.  There have been many more since  then—some headline making like State  championship sports teams,  installation of a Coast Guard radar site serving  mariners and pilots all around  the  globe, a national award as an All-  America City, home to U.S. Senator  Milton Young.  But many more of its successes never  garnered  headlines. They were  the  quiet but meaningful stories of strong  families, vibrant businesses, prosperous  farms, good kids, and the warmth of  citizens who cared about each other.  LaMoure is both a wellspring and a  repository of what is best about America—old-fashioned values of honesty,  decency, hard work, faith, and family.  Its foundation is solid, and its people  will continue to create a community  where dreams are turned into reality.∑  f  125TH ANNIVERSARY OF RUTLAND  ∑",2007

Those pioneers included hopeful immigrants from Norway, Sweden, Germany,  Ireland, Poland, England, and Scotland, seeking  new homesteads on the unbroken prairie; hard-driving businessmen and railroad workers from the Eastern States  finding opportunity on America’s frontier; and the Wahpeton-Sisseton band  of  the Dakota  people,  adapting  to  changing times and preserving ancient  their  world  changed  traditions  as  around them.  These pioneers built a solid foundation of family, faith, and education for  their  community,  establishing  farm  homes,  churches,  and  schools  first.  When  the Great Northern Railway  built its line through the territory, the  community was  given  its name  in  honor of Rutland, VT, the hometown of  many of the pioneer railroaders. The  green hills of the Coteau de Prairie  south of the town, reminded them of  their home in the Green Mountains.  In those early years, the pioneers of  the  Rutland  community  endured  drought, harsh winters, and economic  exploitation,  but  their  faith,  independent spirit, and cooperative attitude carried them through the tough  times and made the good times better.  It has been said that Rutland could be  renamed Phoenix because,  like  that  mythical bird, the city’s business district has twice risen from the ashes of  devastating fires to rebuild better and  stronger each time. One of the business  buildings destroyed by the second fire,  back in 1941, was a unique combination  of  economic  enterprises,  perhaps  a  forerunner of today’s megamalls. The  second floor was a hotel, providing rest  and refuge for weary travelers, while  three businesses occupied the ground  floor: In the front was a harness and  shoe repair shop, keeping Rutland folks  either afoot or on horseback, and they  always knew which; at the center of  the  building was  a  cream  station,  where  farm produce  including chickens,  eggs,  cream,  and  butter was  bought and sold; and at the rear of the  building was a funeral parlor, which  had a double life as an illicit gambling  casino, when a paying customer was  not laid out in somber repose. That  building and those businesses went up  in smoke many years ago, but this  week, another new business, the Rutland General Store, has opened  its  doors on Rutland’s Main Street, showing that the spirit of optimism that inspired our pioneer ancestors  is still  alive and thriving in the community  they built. The optimism and patriotism of Rutland citizens is reflected in  the fact that men and women from the  community have served in the Nation’s  military service in every conflict from  the Civil War to the current engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Over the past 125 years, Rutland has  been noted for many accomplishments:  The home of one of North Dakota’s  outstanding amateur baseball teams,  the Rutland Roosters;  the Rutland  Rockets and Sargent Central Cadets  High School sports teams always tough  and usually victorious; location of the  Tewaukon National Wildlife Refuge,  conserving and preserving our Nation’s  natural heritage; an award as a National Bicentennial Community in 1976;  an award as a North Dakota Centennial  Community  in  1989; home  to Obed  Wyum, a national leader in the establishment of rural electric and rural  telephone cooperatives; and making it  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:31 Jun 20, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G19JN6.032 S19JNPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 6 6 C P 1 D O R P n o l l i t s k c o t s m         ",2007
1659,134,2007-06-19,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased  to  join Senators KENNEDY,  and  LIEBERMANto introduce this important  legislation. In January of this year, the  Judiciary Committee held a hearing to  examine the plight of Iraq’s refugees,  during which we heard from the State  Department, the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees, nongovernmental organizations and individuals,  and Iraqi citizens who had been targeted for assisting the United States.  This hearing brought the enormity of  the Iraq refugee situation into sharp  focus and made clear that we must do  more to address this crisis and provide  assistance especially to those  Iraqis  who have assisted the United States  with its mission. If enacted, this bill  would help the United States fulfill the  promises it has made to the people of  Iraq.  In February of this year, the Bush  administration announced  that  7,000  Iraqi refugees would be permitted to  enter the United States in 2007. Over  the  last 8 months, however, only 70  Iraqis  have  been  allowed  into  the  United States as refugees. Each year  there are 20,000 unallocated slots for  refugees that could be applied to Iraq,  and an additional 5,000 for the Middle  East. Yet the Department of Homeland  Security has admitted approximately  700 Iraqis since the war began in 2003.  We have an obligation to do better  than this when an estimated 4 million  Iraqis have been displaced within Iraq  or have fled the country due to our involvement there. And we have a special  obligation to do all we can for those  Iraqis who have made tremendous sacrifices on behalf of the United States  and who continue to  live under the  threat of torture and death.  Refugees International has called the  Iraq refugee crisis the fastest growing  refugee crisis in the world. It is estimated that nearly 2 million Iraqis have  been  internally displaced, while another 2 million have fled the country,  with little more than they could carry.  With this bill, we show our commitment not to repeat the tragic and immoral mistake from the Vietnam era  and leave friends without refuge and  subject to violent reprisals.  The United States has an obligation  to the people of Iraq, and especially to  those who have assisted the American  military in its efforts there. When an  Iraqi man or woman makes the choice  to help the United States—whether as  an interpreter or in some other role—  and puts his or her life on the line, the  United States bears a special responsibility to do what it can to reciprocate  the loyalty that so many Iraqis have  shown us.  The bill we introduce today will create a new P2 category for Refugees of  Special Humanitarian Concern.  Individuals who have assisted the United  States, or who have worked for a company, NGO, or other entity that has received a grant or contract from the  U.S. Government would be eligible for  status as a refugee of special humanitarian concern. In order to implement  this  new  program,  the  legislation  would direct the establishment of consular processing facilities in Iraq to expedite  the  resettlement  process  for  those Iraqis and their immediate families who qualify under the bill for special relief.  The bill also sets up a special immigrant visa category for individuals who  have worked as interpreters or translators for the United States for an aggregate of 1 year between 2003 and the  present. This new program would augment current efforts to provide protection for those individuals who have assisted the United States by providing  interpreter or translation services.  The legislation would also direct the  Secretary of State to establish an office of Minister Counselor in the U.S.  Embassy in Baghdad. This office would  be responsible for overseeing the new  programs set up under this bill, and  would be the primary point of contact  for eligible individuals seeking protection. This official would also have the  authority to refer individuals directly  to the United States Refugee Resettlement Program. Additionally, parallel  Minister Counselor offices would be established in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and  Lebanon to effectuate the P2 refugee  program.  The Secretary of State would also be  required to work with other nations  currently  hosting  Iraqi  refugees  in  order to provide support and to help  ensure  the  safety and well-being of  Iraqis located in countries surrounding  Iraq. The legislation would also allow  Iraqis who applied for asylum in the  United States after 2003, and who were  denied based on changed country conditions due to the overthrow of Saddam  Hussein, to have those denials reviewed  due to the continuing violence and dangerous conditions in the country. This  change will allow our laws to reflect  the current reality in Iraq.  This  legislation will help  provide  some  relief  to  the brave men and  women who have assisted the United  States in Iraq, and will help renew the  commitment of the United States to  the cause of protecting those who turn  to us for help. I hope all Senators can  join with us in support of the bill we  introduce today.  By Mr. KYL:  S. 1654. A bill to prohibit the sale or  provision of caller ID spoofing services;  to the Committee on the Judiciary.  ",2007
1660,134,2007-06-19,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I rise today  to introduce a bill that would prohibit  the sale or provision of caller ID spoofing services. This bill would enact a  legislative proposal that was made by  the Justice Department in a letter to  members of this committee. To facilitate commentary on this bill, I ask  unanimous consent that the text of the  bill and a letter from the Justice Department be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  or  S. 1654  Section 1040 of title 18, United States Code,  is amended—  (1) by amending subsection (a) to read as  follows:  ‘‘(a) OFFENSE.—Whoever, using any means  or  facility of  interstate or  foreign commerce—  (1) knowingly  generates,  transmits,  causes to be generated or transmitted—  (i) false caller ID information with intent  wrongfully to obtain anything of value; or  (ii) caller ID information pertaining to an  actual person or other entity without that  person’s or entity’s consent and with intent  to deceive any person or other entity about  the identity of the caller; or  (2) knowingly offers, sells, or makes available a service that enables users to modify,  generate, or transmit  false or misleading  caller ID information; or  attempts or conspires to do so, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).’’; and  (2) by adding at the end the following:  ‘‘(f) EXCEPTIONS.—Paragraph (a)(2) does not  prohibit offering, selling, or making available any such service that transmits, in the  signaling data with each call, (1) information  sufficient to indicate to the recipient’s telephone carrier that the caller ID information  is not accurate, (2) if available, the originating telephone number or other information identifying the origin of the call, and (3)  the identity of the provider of the service  that enabled the user to modify, generate, or  transmit the chosen caller ID information.’’  U.S. DEPARTMENTOFJUSTICE,  OFFICEOFLEGISLATIVEAFFAIRS,  Washington, DC, April 25, 2007.  Hon. PATRICKJ. LEAHY,  Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,  U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.  DEARMR. CHAIRMAN: The Department of  Justice appreciates the opportunity to provide further comment on H.R. 740, the ‘‘Preventing  Harassment  Through  Outbound  Number Enforcement Act’’ (‘‘PHONE Act of  2007’’). The PHONE Act of 2007 was passed by  the U.S. House of Representatives on March  21, 2007 and referred to the Senate, where  consideration of the bill is currently pending  before the Judiciary Committee. It is the Department’s understanding that a substitute  amendment will be offered during the Senate  Judiciary Committee’s consideration of this  legislation. This letter reflects DOJ’s views  toward the amended version of this bill.  As the Department noted in its original  comments on the PHONE Act submitted to  Chairman Conyers on February 5, 2007, we  support Congressional action to give law enforcement better tools to protect our citizens and our country from identity thieves,  stalkers, and other criminals. In the February 5th letter, the Department of Justice  made  a  number  of  recommendations  to  strengthen the bill, many of which were  adopted. Those  changes  have made  the  PHONE Act a more effective tool for combating threats such as identity theft, preying on the elderly, and the thwarting of important, time-sensitive investigations.

1661,239,2007-06-19,Mr. BONNER.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Torry Kidd, Sr.,  on the occasion of their 65th wedding anniversary. Torry Kidd, Sr., and Lydia Stallworth  were married on June 26, 1942, at Parsonages at Mt. Zion Baptist Church  in Mobile,  Alabama.  Mr. Kidd  is a  respected member of his  church and community. He has been a member of the Greater Mount Olive Baptist Church  #2 for over 60 years, recently serving as trustee.  In 1942, he began his service with  the  U.S. Army. Following an honorable discharge,  he went to work for McGowin & Lyons Hardware and Supply Company, while earning his  degree from Spaulding Business School. Mr.  Kidd then went to work for Moore Handley and  became the company’s first African-American  salesperson. When  the company  relocated,  Mr. Kidd became  the building manager  for  World Wide Crating and Packing Company.  He retired in 1984 and started Kidd Janitorial  Service.  A member of Andrew Street Church of  Christ for over 60 years, Mrs. Kidd was born  Lydia Stallworth  in Gordonville, Alabama. A  graduate of Lowndes County Training School,  her first job was with a janitorial service. After  raising 11 children, Mrs. Kidd returned to the  work  force and began caring  for elderly patients at Cogburn Nursing Home and later at  the Medic Center  in Mobile. Her skills combined with her compassionate heart led to requests for her service as a private duty nurse,  which she was for over 30 years.  Their 11 children: Torry, Jr., Winston, Sr.,  Anthony, Sr., Christina, Wayne, Sr., Donna,  Arnold, Sr., Amos, Beverly, Mark, Sr., and  Phillip, Sr. would like me to pass on a special  word of appreciation to their parents for the  example  they have set,  the encouragement  they have given; and yes, even the discipline  they have administered. Mr. and Mrs. Kidd’s  family are grateful for the love they shared not  only with them but with their many friends.  Madam Speaker, in these times where there  is so much  trouble and  turmoil on  the  television set and all around us in our communities, it is refreshing to know a family that is  committed to the values and outstanding morals that Mr. and Mrs. Torry Kidd, Sr., have encouraged in their marriage and family. I have  no doubt  that  this marriage symbolizes  the  strength of character and  love of God  that  every American should emulate. I know their  11 children, 25 grandchildren, 32 great grandchildren, and their many friends join with me  in congratulating Mr. and Mrs. Kidd on their  65th anniversary and wishing for them many  more happy celebrations to come.  MAJOR GENERAL JAMES H.  PILLSBURY  IN HONOR OF MRS. WENDY  HARDING  HON. SOLOMON P. ORTIZ  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 19, 2007  ",2007
1662,239,2007-06-19,Mr. ORTIZ.," Madam Speaker, I rise to pay  tribute to MG James H. Pillsbury and his dynamic wife Becky Pillsbury. We hail from the  same great State of Texas. These two wonderful public servants have committed their careers to serving our Nation.  This summer will mark the end of General  Pillsbury’s  tenure  as Commander  of  the  Army’s Aviation and Missile Command at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, a command he assumed on December 1, 2003.  Leaving Huntsville with him is his wife Becky,  who has made a  lasting  impression  in  the  Huntsville community as an area school teacher for the disabled and board member for a  long list of organizations serving soldiers and  their families.  General Pillsbury  is a graduate of Trinity  University  in San Antonio, Texas where he  earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in History.  After that, he attended Troy State University,  earning a Masters of Science in International  Relations. He has completed Infantry Officer  Basic  Course,  Transportation Officer  Advanced Course, United States Army Command and General Staff College, and  the  United States Army War College.  For the past 34 years General Pillsbury has  risen  through  the Army ranks,  first commissioned as a Second Lieutenant  in May of  1973. He has  served here at home and  abroad; his most recent position overseas was  as  the Deputy Chief of Staff, G–4, United  States Army Europe and Seventh Army. General Pillsbury has been decorated with numerous military honors including: the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the  Meritorious Service Medal,  and  the Army  Commendation Medal.  Becky also attended Trinity where she graduated with a degree in Elementary Education  and Education for the Hearing Impaired and  then pursuing her love for children with disabilities by earning a Masters  from Pacific Lutheran University in Elementary Education and  Learning Disabilities.  She has set a high standard  for military  wives at Redstone Arsenal. She co-founded  the ‘‘Dream Factory,’’ a wish granting organization for seriously and terminally ill children;  and more  recently co-founded  ‘‘Still Serving  Veterans,’’ which affects the lives of thousand  of new veterans in offering a wide range of  support services as they transition to the civilian workforce.  Even though this outstanding couple is leaving  the Huntsville community,  they will not  hesitate to come back and visit.  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating MG James H. Pillsbury and his wife  Becky on a phenomenal job in Huntsville . . .  and wishing  them  the best of  luck with  the  next chapter in their lives.  HON. LYNN A. WESTMORELAND  OFGEORGIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 19, 2007  ",2007
1663,239,2007-06-19,Mr. WESTMORELAND.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to recognize and honor Mrs. Wendy  Harding, the 2007 Muscogee County School  District Teacher of the Year.  Almost every student that passes through a  school,  from  the  teacher’s pet  to  the class  clown, has a fond memory of a special teacher who positively  influenced  their  lives. For  many students at Columbus’ Hardaway High  School,  that  teacher has been a Spanish  teacher named Wendy Harding.  Harding knows how  to stick with a good  thing once she’s found it. She stayed happily  married and raised two high-achieving children  with her high school sweetheart Phil, who was  also an educator, until his death from cancer  7 years ago. And Harding has spent every single day of her 31-year professional career at  Hardaway High, making her the longest-serving teacher there.  Principal Matt Bell told the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer that Harding is an integral part of  the school’s success: ‘‘She’s a leader in the  school. She teaches everyone. She heads our  mentor program. She cares about every student who comes through her doorway as well  as students who don’t.  If a student doesn’t  learn  in her class, she  takes  it personally.  They all learn at a high level. They see her  enthusiasm for her subject and her zest for life  and it’s just contagious.’’  Harding says she’s wanted  to become a  teacher since she was 7 years old. Now, she  mentors the next generation of teachers, encouraging her own students  to pick up  the  torch that enlightens young minds. Those influenced by her example include her daughter,  who last year was named First Year Teacher  of  the Year  in a Texas school district. The  skills needed to excel at the head of the classroom obviously run deep in the family blood.  I would like to personally thank Mrs. Harding  for her many years of outstanding service to  the  young  people  of Muscogee County.  Teachers such as her, across Georgia and the  United States, make  a  positive  difference  every day.  On behalf of Georgia’s 3rd Congressional  District, I congratulate the Muscogee County  Teacher of the Year and wish her many years  of continued success.  f  TRIBUTE TO DR. PETER B. AJLUNI  HON.

1665,2,2007-06-27,Mr. EMANUEL.," Mr. Speaker,  for  years the Republican Congress sat idly  by while we spent billions of dollars in  Iraq and  lost thousands of  lives, no  questions asked.  Now Republicans are starting to get  nervous with the lack of results. On  Monday, Senator LUGARsaid President  Bush’s plan to escalate the war in Iraq  has very limited prospects for success  and called on President Bush to begin  to reduce U.S. forces. It’s exactly what  Democrats have been saying all along.  From day one, the new Democratic  Congress said that once we have accountability, benchmarks and reporting requirements, we begin to see the  beginning of the end. I can now say  that the end is in sight. Instead of rubber  stamping  a  failed  Iraq  policy,  Democrats demanded that Republicans  and the country measure the progress  or the lack thereof of the President’s  plan  for more  troops, more money,  more time and more of the same.  Starting in July, we will put the administration of the Republicans to the  test, a new direction in Iraq, or more of  the same of the present course, vote  after vote.  We said last May that we would begin  to see the beginning of the end. Just  this week, we begin to see that light at  the end of the tunnel on this failed policy.  f  DEMOCRAT BROKEN PROMISES  (Mr. PITTS asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2007
1666,2,2007-06-27,Mr. PITTS.," Mr. Speaker, some on the  other side of the aisle made it a habit  to refer to the last session of Congress  as a do-nothing Congress. But it seems  our friends on the other side are trying  to outdo the do-nothingness they complained about all last year.  First  they  clamped  down  on  the  House rules to expedite their so-called  6 for ’06 agenda. Almost none of that  became  law. Then  they delayed an  emergency troop funding bill for more  than  100 days while our  troops  in  harm’s way waited for the resources  they needed to do their job. Now they  seem intent on playing another round  of chicken with the President over this  year’s appropriations bills.  When you throw in hidden earmarks,  slush funds, budget gimmicks and the  largest tax increase in American history, it’s no wonder the Democrat Congress is currently enjoying its lowest  approval ratings ever. Do-nothing Congress? Perhaps now we should say do-  less-than-nothing Congress.  f  LARGEST HUMANITARIAN CRISIS  IN THE WORLD  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",2007
1667,2,2007-06-27,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  the largest refugee crisis in the world,  other than the Darfur, is unfolding in  Iraq. Four million  Iraqis have  fled  their homes. Two million have fled the  country, and an estimated 20- to 50,000  a month or more are added to that toll.  Yet the United States has been able,  with all our resources, to only allow 70  Iraqis  refugee  status  in  the United  States since October, only one in April,  only one in May.  It’s time for us to accept responsibility to aid the people in this desperate plight. If there are any, any of  my colleagues who have any doubt that  we need to change the policy and reach  out to them, I would urge that they  seek out  the  soldiers who have  returned home, who are fighting to try to  save  their  interpreters  and  their  guides.  The heart-wrenching stories of people  via cell phone trying to guide them to  safety will, I hope, inspire you to action and encourage you to support bipartisan legislation, H.R. 2265, for Congress to do its job for these refugees.  f  NOTHING FAIR ABOUT THE  FAIRNESS DOCTRINE  (Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2007
1668,2,2007-06-27,Mr. PENCE.," Beginning in 1949, the  Federal Communications Commission  enforced the so-called fairness doctrine  that required broadcasters to present  controversial issues in a fair and balanced manner.  It  sounds  reasonable  enough,  but  there is nothing fair about the fairness  doctrine. Thankfully, the FCC overturned its own ruling in 1985. Since the  demise of the fairness doctrine, talk  radio has emerged as a dynamic forum  for public debate and an asset to the  Nation.  Unfortunately, in the name of fairness, there has been much talk recent  days about bringing back the fairness  doctrine.  Liberal  think  tanks  and  elected officials in both political parties in Congress are contemplating it.  Bringing back  the  fairness doctrine  would amount to nothing more than  government  control  over  political  views expressed on public airwaves, and  it must not be allowed to occur.  This week I will be introducing the  Broadcaster Freedom Act that will prevent the FCC or any future president  from reinstating the fairness doctrine.  President Kennedy  said,  ‘‘A nation  judge that is afraid to let its people  judge the truth and falsehood in an  open market is a Nation that’s afraid  of its people.’’  I urge my colleagues to join me as  original cosponsors of the Broadcaster  Freedom Act and support every effort  on the floor this week to leave this unfair fairness doctrine on the ash heap  of broadcast history.  f  LUGAR  AND  VOINOVICH  COMMENTS ON IRAQ ARE THE LATEST EXAMPLE THAT WE ARE  OVERDUE FOR A NEW DIRECTION  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2007
1669,2,2007-06-27,Mr. LANGEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, every  day now, it’s becoming more and more  apparent that the President’s troop escalation plan is not stemming the civil  war in Iraq.  In fact, since the plan took effect  earlier this year, violence in Iraq is up,  and our soldiers are paying a heavy  price on the battlefield. For months  now, Democrats have stood united in  our commitment to forge a new direction in Iraq, but our efforts have received very  little support  from congressional Republicans.  It  appears  that  is  beginning  to  change. Earlier this week, one of the  most respected Members of the Republican party on  international affairs,  Senator RICHARDLUGAR, said that we  must recalibrate our strategy in Iraq  to fit our domestic political conditions  and broader needs of national security.  Then  yesterday,  Senator VOINOVICH  said that he doesn’t believe the Iraqis  are going to get it until they know we  are leaving.  Both Senator LUGAR and Senator  VOINOVICH’s comments are a blow to  the White House and serve as yet another example of long-time supporters  of the President’s Iraq policy believing  we are long overdue for a new direction. It’s time for the congressional Republicans to face the reality and join  us in dramatically changing course in  Iraq.

1671,9,2007-06-27,Ms. PRYCE of Ohio.," Mr. Chairman, I  rise in opposition to the amendment  and in support of the provision in question.  Let me first say that I admire the  gentleman  from Arizona’s dedication  to ensure that waste, fraud and abuse  is rooted out of the Federal Government.  Additionally, Mr. Chairman, I believe  that all earmarks  in appropriations  bills should be able to be publicly defended. That is why I welcome this opportunity to explain this project and  assure this body that it is absolutely  appropriate.  To begin with, let me talk about the  Save America’s Treasures account in  which  this  earmark  has  been  designated  for  funding. Save America’s  Treasures is a public-private partnership between the National Park Service and the National Trust For Historic  Preservation. The program has preserved for future generations such important historical treasures as Montpelier,  the home  of President James  Madison; Fort Ticonderoga; and  the  USS Constitution Museum.  So for anyone who has been to Independence Hall in Philadelphia, or the  Old North Church in Boston, or Monticello, or anywhere of historical significance to this country, we should be  able to understand the importance of  experiencing history firsthand at the  sites that history was indeed made. We  can also  imagine the tragic  loss we  would feel if these sites were not preserved.  Therefore, I can say that it is, without a doubt, that the Federal Government should take an interest in preserving sites, artifacts and monuments  that carry special historic significance  in American history. In order to be  considered for funding under this account, Mr. Chairman, a building must  be listed on the National Register of  Historic Places. This is not a simple  designation to acquire. It is very difficult. After extensive State scrutiny  and nomination, there also is a stringent criteria applied by the National  Parks Service.  Specifically,  this project will preserve the Toledo and Ohio Central Railway Depot in my hometown of Columbus and specifically in the community  of Franklinton. Constructed  in 1896,  the T&OC depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in  1973. It is a very unique, pagoda-style  building, designed by noted architect  Frank Packard. Its location is in the  very historic Franklinton neighborhood of Columbus. That is also significant, as this was the site of the first  settlement of all in Central Ohio. In recent years, this building became abandoned and risked being demolished. To  protect this important structure, the  City sought proposals to renovate and  preserve it.  Mr. Chairman, the Columbus Firefighters came to the rescue. They proposed renovation of the historic structure in order to preserve it and to include a public exhibit honoring the history and contribution of firefighting in  our country.  While the total cost of this entire  project  is  $2.7 million,  the  small  $100,000 Federal  investment  through  this earmark will only be used to renovate  the historic  sections  of  this  building to its original glory and preserve  for  future generations.  I  can  think of no better use of such a significant historic building than by those  who maintain the time-honored American tradition of service and sacrifice  fireto one’s neighbors and one’s community.  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman,  this  amendment deserves to be opposed by  all Members of the House who value  the history of our country, the preservation of historic sites and the contribution of firefighters to our communities.  Save America’s Treasures is a valuable program and it is a worthwhile  project that should be preserved. The  combination of preserving the tradition of our Nation’s rail history and  honoring  our  Nation’s  brave  firefighters is worthy of this body’s support.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  ",2007
1672,9,2007-06-27,Mr. FLAKE.," If the gentlewoman will  respond, I have a question. The earmark states that it is for Firefighter’s  Hall in Columbus, but the certification  letter says the money is to go to the  firefighters’ union. Why does the union  get the money?  ",2007
1673,9,2007-06-27,Ms. PRYCE of Ohio., The union provided the contract to do the renovation. The money proposed in this earmark is only for the historical renovation. The firefighters are the ones who  took on the task of coming to the rescue of this very historic site and had  the best bid.  ,2007
1674,9,2007-06-27,Mr. FLAKE., Is there another  fighters’ museum in Columbus?  ,2007
1675,9,2007-06-27,Ms. PRYCE of Ohio., Not that I know  of.  ,2007
1676,9,2007-06-27,Mr. FLAKE.," Let me just say, again,  the gentlewoman mentioned that we  have this program for historic preservation, the Saving America’s Treasures, and that it is tough to get on the  list for that. As I understand it, grants  are given out and those grants are announced in late summer. If you receive  one of  those grants,  then you are  named an historic site or an official recipient. You can also make a contribution. If you are a local entity looking  to have your own facility designated,  you can make a contribution to Save  America’s Treasures and earmark that  for the project that you want it to go  to. There are other ways to receive recognition.  It just seems to me that it would be  more appropriate for the local entities  to bear responsibility for this and not  the Federal Government.  ",2007
1677,9,2007-06-27,Ms. PRYCE of Ohio.," If the gentleman  will yield, this is a $2.7 million project.  The Federal Government’s contribution is $100,000. It is truly a public-private partnership  in which  the  firefighters and the local government and  the State government are participating  fully.  ",2007
1678,9,2007-06-27,Mr. FLAKE.," That  is  understood.  There are a lot of State and local governments everywhere, I would submit,  that would like to have this kind of  participation. But we simply can’t do  it. We simply cannot fund every project  out there. So it seems to me that if we  are going to have a project, or we are  going to have an account that we set  up with the Federal agency, we allow  that to take its course.

The question is on the amendment offered by  the  gentleman  from Michigan  (Mr.  STUPAK).  The amendment was agreed to.  AMENDMENTNO. 22OFFEREDBYMR. JORDANOF  OHIO  ",2007
1680,16,2007-06-27,Mr. JORDAN of Ohio.," Mr. Chairman,  I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk  will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amendment No. 22 offered by Mr. JORDAN  of Ohio:  Page 111, after line 17, insert the following:  TITLE VI—ADDITIONAL GENERAL  PROVISIONS  SEC. 601. Each amount appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act that is not  required  to be appropriated or otherwise  made available by a provision of law is reduced by 4.3 percent.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to  the order of the House of Tuesday,  June 26, 2007, the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. JORDAN) and the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. DICKS) each will control 20 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Ohio.  ",2007
1681,16,2007-06-27,Mr. JORDAN of Ohio.," I thank the  Chair and the Members who are present  here.  This is the fourth time I’ve offered  this amendment to an appropriations  bill. I don’t do it to be a pain in the  neck. In fact, I appreciate the work of  the chairman, I appreciate the work of  the ranking member, and I appreciate  the work of the committee and staff. I  know they look at these line items,  look at these programs, go through and  do the hard work that all committees  do. I appreciate all that work. I simply  bring the amendment forward because I  believe government is too big and that  government spends too much.  This amendment doesn’t cut spending. This amendment, like the previous  ones I have offered, simply says we’re  going to hold the line. We’re going to  spend the same amount we spent in the  last  fiscal year. Nothing more than  that. That’s all the amendment does. It  allows the committee who understands  these programs, who does the work and  puts this bill together, to go back and  look and figure out where those cuts  should happen using  their expertise  that they’ve developed  in this committee to do that. It simply says, it’s  not too much to ask government to do  what millions of families have to do  across this country, live on last year’s  spending  levels,  live on  last year’s  budget.  It is important we do this, in my  judgment,  for  two  reasons. Again  I  have articulated these each time I’ve  brought this amendment  forward  for  the body to consider. The first is there  are financial problems, financial concerns, some would even say crisis looming for America if we don’t get a handle on the spending. $3 trillion budget.  This bill increases spending by over a  billion dollars in this one area. The  more we run up deficits, the more that  leads to debt, the more that leads to  less saving, the more that leads to less  economic growth, the tougher it makes  it in the future to deal with the economic crisis that is in fact coming.  Again, you don’t have to take my  word for it. All kinds of experts have  talked about this, whether it’s entitlement programs, discretionary  spending,  it’s  government  spending  and  there are problems looming if we don’t  begin to get a handle on the spending  levels that we appropriate. There is no  better place to start than right now,  saying, let’s just do what we did last  year. Let’s just hold the line on spending.  The second reason that this is so important: whenever you start to spend  and spend and spend and have these  kinds of things take place, it inevitably leads to greater taxes. I’ve often  heard the phrase tax-and-spend politicians. It’s actually more appropriate to  say spend and tax. Spending drives the  equation. The more you spend, that  leads to taxes  in the  future. If you  went out and asked the American people, Mr. Chairman, is government too  big or too small, my guess is the vast  majority of Americans would say it’s  too big.  Think about this: government spends  on average $23,000 per household. We’ve  got a $3 trillion annual budget that we  spend on. Many of those things are appropriate, but overall if you ask the  American people is government too big  or too small, they would say it’s too  big. If you asked them the same question,  are  Americans  overtaxed  or  undertaxed, my guess is the vast majority of Americans would say we’re  overtaxed. In fact, a typical family, 50  cents of every dollar they spend goes to  some level of government in the form  of taxes. It’s not too much to ask government to hold the line on spending,  to live on what we did last year, to live  on the same amount.  b1200  That’s what this amendment does. I  bring it forward, not to be a pain to the  committee,  I appreciate their work,  but simply to point out it’s time we get  a handle on spending if we are going to  be able to let or help America have the  economic growth that we need to see  happen in this country in the future.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance  of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Washington State is recognized for up to 20 minutes.  ",2007
1682,16,2007-06-27,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself as much time as I might consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  this amendment.  Am going to be brief here. This would  be a devastating cut on this bill. I want  to say something to the gentleman.  These bills do have consequences.  Over the last 7 years, since this administration took power, the Interior  Department’s budget has been cut in  real terms by 16 percent. The EPA’s  budget has been cut in real terms by 29  percent, and the Forest Service budget  has been cut in real terms, taking fire  out, by 35 percent. This is one of the  few bills that has been devastated by  this administration, and it’s a regrettable fact.  All our bill does is stop this downward trend in our national parks, our  downward trend in our national wildlife refuges, and our downward trend in  enforcement and clean water and clean  air  in  the environmental protection  area, and the reduction in personnel,  not  covering  fixed  costs until Mr.  Kempthorne came in, and he is only  covering the fixed costs for the Interior  Department. This is a devastating cut  that would reverse all the good work in  this bill.  I just think it’s totally irresponsible,  and I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this. We need  the money for the firefighters, there is  a huge fire out there in Lake Tahoe  right now. We need to get this bill  passed.  This kind of across-the-board meat-  ax approach will not be successful, I  predict. I just tell the gentleman that  his amendment goes way too far and  would have devastating consequences.  It would undermine  the President’s  Centennial Challenge that Mr. Kempthorne has worked so hard to create.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time and urge a ‘‘no’’ vote  on the gentleman’s amendment.  ",2007
1683,16,2007-06-27,Mr. JORDAN of Ohio.," Mr. Chairman,  before recognizing the gentlelady from  Tennessee, I would just point out this,  we always hear this, devastating cut.  This not a cut. This is simply saying  we are going to spend what we spent  last year.  In fact, last week we had this big debate on the legislative branch bill and  on other appropriations bills, and the  majority party was pointing to the  President’s request. What we spent last  year is actually more than what the  President requested in this budget.  Devastating cut, I mean, we always  hear, it’s interesting, politicians who  spend the tax dollars of families and individual taxpayers across this country,  always say the sky is going to fall if we  can’t get more of your money and  spend it on things we think are important.  All we’re saying is you know what,  it’s not too much to ask that government do what families do all the time,  and that is spend on last year’s level.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentlelady  from Tennessee  (Mrs.  BLACKBURN).  ",2007
1684,16,2007-06-27,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," I thank Mr. JORDAN for the good work that he is doing  right here.

1687,23,2007-06-27,Mr. OLVER.," Mr. Chairman, I yield 4  minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. RYAN).  ",2007
1688,23,2007-06-27,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate a couple of points, because we  seem to be having this debate every  week. It seems to be on the same issues  we have always been talking about.  But I find it not necessarily enjoyable,  but an obligation, to get up and communicate  to  the American  taxpayer  and the citizens of this country that  over the last 6 years, the Republican  House, Republican Senate, Republican  White House,  borrowed  $3  trillion.  They asked the Treasury Department  to raise the debt limit five or six times  to allow them to go out and borrow  more money.  You borrowed  it  from China. You  borrowed it from Japan. You borrowed  it from OPEC countries. On and on and  on and on. All of a sudden, 5 or 6  months into this year, before we have  even passed a budget, you are lecturing  us on fiscal responsibility.  I want the taxpayers, Mr. Chairman,  to keep their forms from this year and  compare them to their tax forms next  year. They will see absolutely no increase in their taxes whatsoever. None.  Zero. So, there is not a tax increase in  this 2008 budget.  Now, let’s talk about what you are  proposing to cut with this amendment.  Superfund sites. Okay, you want to  cut the Superfund site program that is  going to clean up the most toxic sites.  In many of the old industrial areas like  mine, the gentleman knows very well,  they were polluted in the 1930s, 1940s,  and 1950s. We can’t develop the local  economy because where we have water  lines and where we have sewer lines,  they are contaminated.  Quite frankly, the city of Youngstown and the city of Warren do not  have millions of dollars to put into this  because their tax base has eroded. If  you want us to contribute to the tax  base like we did in the 1930s, 1940s and  1950s when, quite frankly, a lot of that  money that was taken out of Youngstown, Ohio, was used to develop the  West and to develop new water lines  and sewer lines in the South in many  of your districts, all we are asking is  for a little bit of help.  b1315  Help us clean up the brownfield sites.  How about your cutting the methamphetamine  prevention  and  treatment program? I am sure you can’t  wait to get back to your districts and  tell that to your constituents. How  about those of you in the West fighting  wildfires? You are going to cut that  program.  Mr. Chairman, many will say there  are not any cuts in this bill. There are  cuts in this bill: $193 million cut from  construction account, it eliminates $31  million for landowner incentives; $39  million cut for the EPA Mexican border program; $24 million cut from the  EPA Alaska Village setaside; $24 million cut from the Indiana land consolidation. There are cuts in here. We are  not raising taxes. We are making investments into our community.  Just because, Mr. Chairman, the minority party raised the debt $3 trillion,  just because  the minority party  is  ashamed, quite frankly, of their behavior over the past 6 years doesn’t mean  that  they can displace all of  their  shamefulness on the new Democratic  majority.  I wouldn’t want to admit  that I borrowed $3 trillion from Japan  and China either. I would run from it  as fast as I could. But that doesn’t  change the facts.  So I think we should vote down this  amendment. There are great  investments for local communities all over  the country in this bill, and I think we  should keep it.  ",2007
1689,23,2007-06-27,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Mr. Chairman,  I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to my  good friend, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. FLAKE), a champion for fiscal  responsibility  and  fiscal  reform  in  Washington.  ",2007
1690,23,2007-06-27,Mr. FLAKE.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I think this is a real  test here. We all campaign every 2  years, and we put out campaign literature. We go speak at town halls and  other events. And I would venture to  guess that not one person in this body  said, Reelect me because we need to  spend more on Interior appropriations.  We need to spend more. We need to  spend 4 percent more than we did last  year. I am going to go back to Washington and spend $1.2 billion more than  we did last year.  I venture that nobody said that. Virtually everybody said we need to rein  in spending. We need to promote fiscal  responsibility.  I am the first to concede we didn’t do  a good job of it over here. For the past  several years we have grown government far too big. That is part of the  reason we are now in the minority. But  the majority  comes now and  says,  don’t lecture us, we are going to increase that spending.  This bill  spends  $1.2 billion more  than  last year. Last year spent too  much. This year spends too much too  much again.  So, please, we know we did wrong.  That is why we are in the minority.  But when you are in the majority now,  let’s exercise  some  fiscal discipline.  There are plenty of areas that can receive cuts. We have outlined several of  them over the past several hours with  amendments.  Museum funding, part of the reason  the gentleman from New Mexico mentioned that we have a backlog at the  National Parks, he is right. But yet in  the authorizing committee, we have  created several more National Heritage  Areas and earmarked a lot more money  for them. There are earmarks in this  bill for National Heritage Areas. That  is money that will come out of the National Parks budget. They will tell you  if you spend money here on this new  area, this National Heritage Area, you  can’t  spend money maintaining  the  parks that we already have. Many of us  have fought to stop that. We have said  don’t keep creating these National Heritage Areas. Yet with the new majority, we are creating them at a faster  rate than we ever have.  I would say, let’s promote fiscal discipline. Let’s pass this amendment.  ",2007
1691,23,2007-06-27,Mr. OLVER.," Mr. Chairman, I would  just like to speak to the gentleman  who has just spoken. I commend the  gentleman who has just spoken. I think  he has taken a very responsible, very  serious approach to budgeting over the  last several sessions, and I appreciate  that sort of thing very much.  But I would say that here we are in  this instance with an amendment that  takes an approach not quite across-the-  board, but gives the total responsibility off to the President of the United  States to decide where to make any  cuts he wishes to make, which, I repeat, is an abrogation of our responsibility under the Constitution that we  take an oath to.  I would say that also this is a bad approach because after 40 amendments,  each of which has been defeated, and 40  amendments which have had so little  merit to them that they have been defeated, many of them by roll call votes,  by roll call votes, and the sum total of  all those amendments was considerably  more than the $276 million, to now  throw up your hands and try to do it in  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:32 Jun 28, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K27JN7.069 H27JNPT1 N C _ E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o l e o n c         ",2007

Does any other Member wish to be  heard on the point of order?  The proponent of an item of appropriation carries the burden of persuasion on the question whether it is supported by an authorization in law.  Having reviewed the amendment and  entertained argument on the point of  order, the Chair is unable to conclude  that the  item of appropriation contained in the amendment is authorized  in law.  Under the precedents of July 12, 1995,  as recorded in House Practice at page  145, and July 16, 1997, an amendment  adding matter at the pending portion  of the bill to effect an indirect increase  in an unauthorized amount permitted  to remain in a portion of the bill already passed  in  the  reading  is not  ‘‘merely perfecting’’  for purposes of  clause 2(a) of rule XXI.  The Chair is therefore constrained to  sustain the point of order under clause  2(a) of rule XXI.  ",2007

And, yes, the gentleman from California was having offsets for his cuts,  but I see no ill will in allowing the  House to work its will on Mr. DOOamendment, which  affects  Western States deeply. It’s very similar to what the gentleman from Oregon  is also trying to do, so why don’t we  just let both of them go, let the House  work its will?  ",2007

1706,30,2007-06-27,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," Mr. Chairman, I’d just like to express my deep  disappointment that we’re not able to  move  forward  on  the  gentleman’s  amendment  from California, and the  peril that it may put the next amendment in.  If you want to talk about cuts in crisis, you come out to rural Oregon,  rural Washington, rural Northern California, the areas that my friend and  colleague from Washington knows all  too well.  The largest county in my district had  15 or 16 libraries, all of which are now  shuttered and closed because this Congress and the last failed to reauthorize  the Secure County Roads and Schools  legislation that the Congress before, in  2000, put into law.  The effect of all that, and the effect  of this not going forward is those counties have a 1-year stay of execution because in the emergency supplemental  there was legislation that funded them  for one more year.  But as  the good gentleman  from  Washington State knows, with the decline in the timber industry, the decline in harvest on Federal lands, these  rural counties have been devastated.  They have no tax base in some cases,  or very little; 70, 80 percent of land  mass is Federal lands. There’s been a  commitment for 100 years by this Congress to share revenues, and then those  revenues went away. Law enforcement  is going away. Basic services. You all  would throw a fit if they went away in  Washington, D.C. or any other urban  area.  ",2007
1707,30,2007-06-27,Mr. DICKS.," Mr. Chairman, will the  gentleman yield?  ",2007
1708,30,2007-06-27,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon., I yield to  the gentleman from Washington.  ,2007
1709,30,2007-06-27,Mr. DICKS.," The point  I’d  like to  make, this is an authorization problem. This isn’t supposed to be handled  on the appropriations bill. We had an  agreement that we would help you do  this for 1 year, but then you would go  back to the Natural Resources Committee and find the mandatory spending to offset this. This is not an appropriations matter.  ",2007
1710,30,2007-06-27,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," Reclaiming  my time, I understand, and I appreciate what the gentleman has done to  assist us in the past. My frustration is  the one I have to share, because when  I go home, people don’t understand  why we can keep  funding all these  other things and can’t take care of sort  of an organic funding issue that affects  them deeply.  The first bill I cosponsored in this  Congress with my colleague from Oregon, Mr. DEFAZIO, and many others  was to reauthorize this program. I believe the first letter I sent was to the  new chairman of the Resources Committee begging for a hearing to reauthorize this program.  The folks at home don’t understand  this process, and sometimes neither do  I. But if we have to bring down the  House to try and get help to people  who deserve it, then that’s what we’ll  have to do.  It’s really unfortunate that we would  abrogate  this commitment  to  these  people in rural areas and not allow us  at least to move forward, and certainly  with the next amendment, which merely fixes a technical correction, allows  the Resource advisory committees to  go forward, but spends no money.  ",2007
1711,30,2007-06-27,Mr. TIAHRT.," Reclaiming my time, I  just want to point out to the chairman  that we’re now picking winners and  losers, and it’s an arbitrary decision.

1715,37,2007-06-27,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Chairman, I thank my  friend for yielding.  Just to reiterate, Mr. Chairman, numerous agencies that have looked at  the science of polar bear management  in Canada and other places feel that  the limited permits that are issued for  this hunting purpose is conducive to  conservation efforts and habitat protection  up  in  Canada,  especially  through  the  indigenous  tribes  there  that are  issued these permits every  year.  The Canadian letter that I just referenced earlier stated, ‘‘Removal of the  sports hunting exemption from the Marine Mammal Protection Act would  have no impact,’’ no impact, ‘‘on the  numbers harvested, but would cause  economic hardship  to  the Canadian  northern indigenous communities.’’  Again quoting from the letter from  Canada, ‘‘Any action such as that proposed in the amendment is premature  and should at least await the outcome  of the two reviews.’’ The two reviews  they are referring to is our own Fish  and Wildlife review and also a Canadian review in regards to the status of  polar bear populations, those reports  are going to be coming due some time  early next year.  Also, the National Wildlife Federation, I want to clarify, the National  Wildlife Federation has not endorsed  nor opposed Mr. INSLEE’s amendment,  but they stated in a letter submitted to  Members of Congress yesterday,  ‘‘We  understand that there may be a debate  about managing  polar  bear  populations, which we believe is a distraction  from  the  real  issue of global  warming.’’ They go on to state that the  only thing that could adequately protect  the  polar  bear  population  is  prompt action taken on global warming.  Mr. Speaker, I would agree with the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. INSLEE) on the importance of that issue.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Washington (Mr. INSLEE)  is recognized for 15 seconds.  ",2007
1716,37,2007-06-27,Mr. INSLEE.," Mr. Chairman, I would  just like to submit that the day we  yield to Canadian judgment, we would  replace baseball with ice hockey. It is  not the American principle. We have a  strong Marine Mammal  Protection  Act. It has a clear loophole. We do not  want the last polar bears to be head  and skins in dens. We want this species  to continue. This will do that.

The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amendment No. 2 offered by Mr. UDALLof  Colorado  Page 111, after line 17, insert the following:  TITLE VI—ADDITIONAL GENERAL  PROVISIONS  SEC. 601. None of the funds made available  by this Act shall be used to prepare or publish final regulations regarding a commercial leasing program for oil shale resources  on public lands pursuant to section 369(d) of  the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law  109–58) or to conduct an oil shale lease sale  pursuant to subsection 369(e) of such Act.  The Acting CHAIRMAN  (Mr. SNYDER). Pursuant  to  the order of  the  House of Tuesday, June 26, 2007, the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. UDALL)  and the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  LAMBORN) each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. UDALL).  ",2007
1719,37,2007-06-27,Mr. UDALL of Colorado.," Mr. Chairman, this amendment would bar the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land  Management  from  issuing any  final  regulations for commercial-scale leasing of oil shale and from offering any  commercial oil shale leases during fiscal year 2008.  Current law requires BLM to issue  those regulations, and to move to a  full-scale commercial leasing program,  on a crash basis and under a tight  deadline.  I think that is a mistake, so I want  to make it clear I support Chairman  RAHALL’s bill, H.R. 2337, that would  change that and other parts of the 2005  Energy Act. The Natural Resources  Committee has favorably reported the  chairman’s bill and it is headed toward  this very floor.  The purpose of this amendment is to  slow the administration down in the  meantime, in order to give Congress  time to complete action on that legislation.  Mr. Chairman, oil shale has great potential as an energy source, and therefore it is an important part of our energy policy. But it is also important to  American taxpayers, because they own  most of it. But it is particularly important for Colorado.  Our State has  some of  the most  large-scale deposits of oil shale, and  Coloradans, particularly those on our  Western Slope, will be directly affected  by its development.  Back in 2005, the RAND Corporation  reported that the potential benefits of  developing oil shale were significant.  But they also made it clear that development will affect not only our land  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:32 Jun 28, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K27JN7.109 H27JNPT1 N C _ E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o l e o n c         ",2007

Is it also true he would stop the permitting in Wyoming as well?  ",2007
1723,44,2007-06-27,Mr. CANNON.," That  is  true. This  would delay the development of oil  shale. The Udall amendment would  delay it in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. My amendment would limit that  effect to just Colorado and allow Wyoming and Utah to develop their shale  as they wish.  ",2007
1724,44,2007-06-27,Mr. TIAHRT.," So, Mr. Chairman, as I  understand this, what the gentleman  from Utah is doing is his very best to  represent the  interests of his State.  And what the gentleman from Colorado  is doing was try to represent the best  interests of his State. So I think in  fairness to the Members of Colorado,  Utah and Wyoming, it would be proper  for us to adopt Mr. CANNON’s amendment. That way it would satisfy Mr.  UDALLby restricting and limiting the  permitting process in Colorado but allowing the gentleman  from Utah to  represent his district by  letting the  permitting process move forward.  So I would encourage the Members of  the House to support Mr. UDALL via  Mr. CANNON’s amendment and vote to  accept the Cannon amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

1731,65,2007-06-27,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as most of us know,  some time ago in 1991, President Bush,  with bipartisan support, reached out to  the Andean countries and extended favorable treatment as related to their  exports to the United States.  This has proven successful in making  it possible for these countries to get  substitute crops for coca, and, therefore, it has been tremendously successful in building up a market for the people in this area, as well as people in the  United States of America.  Right now, however, there are four  free trade agreements that are pending  that haven’t passed the House as yet,  which includes, of course, Peru. So as  we speak, there are two countries for  which free trade agreements have not  been negotiated, Colombia and Peru. If  we were to allow this provision to expire, we would find ourselves in the situation where these countries and their  tariffs would be in disarray.  Because of the shortness of notice,  and because we have to avoid the expiration, I have been able to work with  Mr. MCCRERY in our committee to get,  not a 2-year extension that we would  really want, but at least an 8-month  extension to avoid irreparable damage  from being caused during this period,  at which time we will again able to review the situation  in the  free trade  agreements and also the substance of  the continuation of the Andean Trade  Preference Act, trade promotion agreements.  b1815  I also would like to say, in working  with Mr. MCCRERYof the committee,  the Members  of  this House  should  know that the cooperative spirit  in  which we got this extension extended  to the point that we had to really go to  the other Chamber in order to work  out what we’re able to do today.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I reserve  the balance of my time.  ",2007
1732,65,2007-06-27,Mr. MCCRERY.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself so much time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I’ve been an avid supporter  of Andean  preferences,  and  today I voice my support for this short-  term extension of the preferences. And  I want to thank Chairman RANGEL for  working with me and others to effect  what we believe should pass on the  floor today under suspension of the  rules.  Our country’s relationship with the  Andean countries of Peru, Colombia,  Ecuador and Bolivia is vitally important, and preferences have helped enormously with their economic development and with stability in the region.  At the same time, however, I believe  it is time to move to a more substantial, mature and reciprocal relationship  through  free  trade agreements.  The  unilateral  preferences  provide  duty-free treatment to products from  the region, but very limited value to  United States interests in return. The  FTAs, the free trade agreements, provide reciprocal market access benefits,  creating new opportunity  for United  States producers, farmers and exporters.  I might add that our FTAs also create greater obligations on our trading  partners than preferences by requiring  them to abide by fundamental labor  rights and certain multilateral environmental agreements.  Right now we have an immediate opportunity to implement the FTAs with  Peru and Colombia, with the possibility of future FTAs with Ecuador and  Bolivia. We should seize this opportunity now. Both Peru and Colombia  have already passed the pending FTAs,  and they are expected soon to pass  amendments to them reflecting the recently concluded bipartisan trade deal  on labor and the environment.  It’s time for our Congress here in the  United States to move these FTAs, too.  Preferences are a stopgap measure. Our  trading partners and United States interests deserve more than that. Every  day we wait is a lost opportunity to  gain the advantages of those more mature agreements.  With respect to Ecuador and Bolivia,  I  remain  very  concerned with  the  treatment of United States investors  there. This 8-month extension gives us  time to evaluate how these countries  are abiding by the preference program  requirements with respect to United  States investment. We will be watching  developments very carefully.  Mr. Speaker, I support this short-  term extension of preferences  for  8  months, which will give us the time we  need  to  implement our outstanding  free trade agreements in the region.  The first step will be to complete congressional action on the Peru agreement, I hope, before the August recess.  The time is now to solidify our relationship, instead of perpetuating what  I believe  is an unsatisfactory status  quo.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
1733,65,2007-06-27,Mr. RANGEL.," Mr. Speaker, I’d like  to yield 4 minutes to Mr. LEVIN, who’s  been the subcommittee Chair on Trade  and has done an absolutely great job in  spearheading this bipartisan approach  of this sensitive subject.  (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2007
1734,65,2007-06-27,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. Speaker, as we proceed, it should be clear. We’re talking  now about  the Andean Trade Preference Act,  and we’re not  talking  about the free trade agreements that  have been discussed here.  In my view, whether one supports or  opposes any of those free trade agreements, it would be counterproductive  for someone to vote against extension  of the ATPA for 8 months.

1736,72,2007-06-27,Ms.  MATSUI.,  (Mr. DREIER asked and was given  permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ,2007
1737,72,2007-06-27,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  reluctant  opposition  to  the  rule.  I  know that this is a rule that follows  the 200-year tradition that we have had  of appropriations bills as privileged  resolutions. They have the ability to  come to the floor without a rule at all,  but if items are protected in the bill,  they have to provide waivers from the  Rules Committee, and that is what has  been followed here. We did this when  the Republicans were in the majority  and the Democrats are following suit  here.  But there are a number of concerns  that have come to the forefront. To  me, the most important concern, Mr.  Speaker, is one that I raised upstairs in  the Rules Committee last night.  The Committee on Ways and Means  had put into place a very important  program  in September of 2006 which  deals with an issue that is near and  dear  to every  single American who  pays taxes. That issue is ensuring that  every single American pays their taxes.  I don’t like paying taxes. But I do it.  Mr. Speaker, I don’t  like the  fact  that there are people out there who  don’t pay their taxes when they are  supposed to do it. The challenge of collecting taxes is a very, very important  concern of, as I said, every American  who does pay their taxes. Collecting  taxes is a very important thing, too.  Making sure that people do comply  with the law is, I believe, an imperative that we need to do all we can to  enforce.  Unfortunately,  this  appropriations  bill that we are bringing forward is one  that actually  eliminates a program  that has been extraordinarily effective.  It is a program, Mr. Speaker, that has  been utilized now by the Federal Government and by 40 of the 50 States.  What does it consist of? Simply contracting with private collection agencies, PCAs, to ensure that people who  are deadbeats, who are not paying their  taxes, actually pay their taxes.  Mr. Speaker, this issue does not fall  under the  jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. I see Mr. RANGEL  here and other members of the Ways  and Means Committee. Mr. MCCRERY  sent a letter to us in the Rules Committee saying that he believed that  this rule should not allow protection  for a point of order to be made against  the provision about which I am speaking.  b1915  So, Mr. Speaker, I feel very strongly  about the need for us to make sure  that the Ways and Means Committee  can have the jurisdiction, and, frankly,  keep in place this collection process.  So far, $19.4 million has been collected  from people who have not paid their  taxes by these private collection agencies, and the projection is that over the  next 10 years in excess of $1.5 billion  will be collected by the Federal Government from these people who have  been deadbeats and have not paid their  taxes. So I think it is very unfortunate  that this bill proceeds with this, and  the fact that this rule does not provide  us with an opportunity to address that  has led me to oppose it.  I also want to say, Mr. Speaker, that  there is going to be an effort to defeat  the previous question, and if that is  done, our colleague from Nebraska Mr.  TERRY is going to offer an amendment  to the rule that would make in order a  provision that would allow for the rejection  of  the  cost-of-living  adjustment.  I know there is a lot of talk around  here about that issue, so we are going  to be having a vote on that. Our colleague from Nebraska, as I said, Mr.  TERRYwill in fact be the author of that  amendment if we did defeat the previous question on this issue.  Having said that, I do want to say  there are a number of items in this bill  that I think are very good and important. I am particularly proud of having  worked for a number of years on the  issue of financial literacy training for  students and for adults as well.  We see this proliferation of advertising, Mr. Speaker, that continues to  come down from a wide range of entities, and it can be confusing. Unfortunately, there are many young people  today who really don’t have the grasp  of the financial instruments that are  options to them out there. For that  reason, I believe that something in this  bill that is very good is the effort to  focus on the increase of financial literacy training.  Mr. Speaker, I want to praise my colleagues, especially Mr. REGULA, who  has taken on this responsibility here as  the  ranking member  of  the  subcommittee, and Mr. SERRANO, who is  chairing  the  subcommittee.  I praise  them for working together in a bipartisan way on some other items that are  very important.  As I said, I believe that interdicting  illicit drugs is a very important issue.  This drug trafficking issue was a topic  of discussion in the last debate that we  had on the Andean Trade Preference  Act that we are going to be voting on  later this evening, and I believe that  there are, again, many, many other  items that are included in this bill that  are good and decent and appropriate  measures.  But I just am very, very concerned  about this issue, as I said, Mr. Speaker,  of this notion of people abusing the tax  provisions and not,  in  fact, paying  their  fair share of taxes. So  I  feel  strongly  that  taking  advantage  of  these private collection agencies is, in  fact, the right thing to do. I know  there is concern voiced about that, because people don’t like being harassed.  But you know what, Mr. Speaker? If  they are not paying their fair share of  taxes, I believe steps should be taken  to try and get them to do that. So this  is going to lead me to oppose the rule.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my  very  good  friend  from Greensboro,  North Carolina (Mr. COBLE).  ",2007
1738,72,2007-06-27,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  distinguished  gentleman  from  California for yielding. We are in disagreement about the proposed COLA.  Mr. Speaker, I oppose the proposed  cost-of-living allowance  increase because it is ill-timed. I represent constituents, as do many of you, who earn  $25,000 to $35,000 annually, and they  read  that  the Congress  approves  a  COLA  increase  for  themselves. Not  good.  According to recent polls, Americans  don’t like the Congress. Our numbers,  lower than President Bush’s numbers,  are in the tank. To enact this COLA  proposal will do nothing, in my opinion, to improve our already diminished  reputation.  Mr. Speaker, my fiscal philosophy is  very simple: Taxpayers pay our salaries, and beyond that, in my opinion,  they owe us little more. I have refused  a  congressional pension,  so when  I  leave the Congress I will receive not  one brown penny of congressional pension money, because  I don’t believe  taxpayers owe me a congressional pension just because I served in the Congress.

1740,79,2007-06-27,Mr. HOYER.," Mr. Speaker, I want to  inform the House of what I perceive to  be the schedule for the coming balance  of the week.  It  is our  intention  to go until  1  o’clock tonight on debate only. We will  roll votes. There will be no  further  votes. I’ve talked to the leadership on  the other side. There will be no votes  for the balance of the evening.  It is my expectation, barring some  unforeseen action in conferences, that  we will conclude this bill tomorrow,  hopefully, with the consideration of all  Members, relatively early, in the late  afternoon. And  that would conclude  the week’s business if we don’t have  any conference reports.  Now, I want to make it clear, should  the unforeseen happen  in  the  conference,  there are a couple of conferences pending, if they move, that  would change. I don’t expect that to be  the case, but I want everybody to understand that we do have some conferences that may go forward. I doubt  that they would be in shape to come  here,  but  if  they  did,  that would  change.  But presently, Mr. Speaker, I believe  the schedule would be we go until 1  o’clock,  debate  amendments,  offer  amendments. Those amendments that  called for votes would be rolled until  tomorrow morning at 10 o’clock. We  would vote on  those. And  then we  would complete the bill and be complete for the week and take leave for  the July work period at that point in  time.  f  HONORING THE LIFE OF EACH OF  THE FALLEN CITY OF CHARLESTON FIREFIGHTERS  ",2007

1743,93,2007-06-27,Mr. REGULA.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. REHBERG), a member of the  subcommittee.  ",2007
1744,93,2007-06-27,Mr. REHBERG.," Mr. Chairman,  in  light of the distressing statistics regarding the Office of National Drug  Control Policy’s National Youth Media  Campaign, and  its subsequent reduction within our committee, I rise today  to let my colleagues know that it is  possible  to  design,  implement  and  evaluate youth anti-drug marketing.  Methamphetamine is a real problem  across this great Nation, and no State  is immune to its horrible effects. Montana ranks among the top 10 States nationally in per capita treatment admissions for methamphetamine use.  The statistics in Montana are truly  staggering. Fifty-two percent of the  children who are placed in out-of-home  care are there because of meth.  Fifty percent of adults incarcerated  at State prisons are there due to meth.  Twenty percent of Montanans in addiction treatment are there because of  meth.  While many people would simply nod  their heads and agree this is a terrible  problem, some good people in Montana  have taken it upon themselves to do  something about it.  Tom Siebel, who lives in Wolf Creek,  is an outstanding Montanan who did  something that many of us could not  do. He decided to use his own money to  fund a prevention campaign to help  raise awareness about the dangers of  first time methamphetamine use. Tom  Siebel  founded  the Montana Meth  Project in 2005, which has been conducting research and running a statewide multi-media  public  awareness  campaign aimed at significantly reducing  first-time methamphetamine use  through public service messaging, public policy, and community outreach.  Results from the Montana Meth Use  & Attitudes Survey conducted earlier  this year show the dramatic and successful impact that the Montana Meth  Project’s public  education  campaign  has had on its intended audience.  Over the past 2 years, there has also  been a dramatic shift in the perception  of methamphetamine use, more  frequent  parent-child  communications  about  the  dangers  of methamphetamine,  and  greater  societal  disapproval. For the first time, meth use  and associated crime in Montana has  declined.  The States of Arizona and Idaho are  using Montana’s hard-hitting ads and  I  successful approach, launching similar  youth media campaigns. Clearly, the  efforts of the Montana Meth Project  are working.  ",2007

1746,93,2007-06-27,Mr. RUPPERSBERGER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the fiscal year  2008 Financial Services Appropriation,  and I urge Members to vote for this  bill. It is an excellent bill approved by  the subcommittee unanimously. It is  below the President’s request, and fulfills our obligation to be efficient with  the  taxpayers’  dollars.  I  commend  Chairman SERRANOand Ranking Member REGULA for their  leadership and  their bipartisan achievement.  As a former prosecutor and county  executive, I am especially proud of several initiatives in the bill. I would like  it highlight one program specifically.  There is $226 million, a $6 million increase, over the President’s budget for  high-intensity drug trafficking areas.  HIDTA  funding enables  local, State  and Federal law enforcement to work  together in fighting the war against  drugs.  As a county executive in Baltimore  County, we worked with HIDTA  to  bring everyone to the table who had a  stake in stopping drug trafficking. We  don’t stop drug buys with just a single  piece of  information.  It  takes  solid  policework,  intelligence, and trained  experts analyzing information to help  officers make the drug arrests.  b2145  The HIDTA program  is making a  major impact in areas like Baltimore,  Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York and other locations.  Statistics show that drugs are connected to over 70 percent of all violent  crime in the United States. This increase in HIDTA funding helps protect  this  country  and  our  communities  against drug dealers and other violent  criminals.  I urge my colleagues to support the  Financial Services appropriations bill.  ",2007

But it has nothing to do with  this amendment because it’s not about  small business. We haven’t  lost the  share of small business. But the gentleman has reinforced my point. I mentioned Shanghai. Shanghai  is appropriate, because this amendment is an  attempt  to  shanghai  small business  into  the cause of undermining Sarbanes-Oxley and undercutting the effort by the SEC, supported by the Secretary of the Treasury—and I assume  the Bush administration—to allow the  process of scaling back Sarbanes-Oxley  to be done in an orderly, reasonable  fashion.

1755,121,2007-06-27,Mr.  CONAWAY.," Thank  Chairman.  Perhaps the next couple of hours, and  certainly most of all day tomorrow,  Member after Member on our side will  come down here to these microphones  and attempt to reduce spending in this  appropriations  bill. My  amendment  would fix a problem that they will have  should they be successful  in any of  their amendments.  Under our existing rules, the existing  processes under which we work, the  budget  is  passed  and  is  allocated  among  the  various  programs under  what we call a 302(b) allocation. Each  of  these  subcommittees bring  their  bills down here in a total amount to be  spent. As I have mentioned, Member  after Member will come down here to  attempt to convince a majority of us to  reduce the spending that is included in  the bill. Should they be successful, it’s  not likely but should they be successful in reducing that spending the little  known  secret, unknown outside  the  Beltway,  is  that  the  actual  total  amount of spending under the 302(b) allocation will not change, no matter  what we do here on this floor. It stays  where it is.  And so what my amendment would  do, it would be to take those successful  attempts to reduce spending and would  funnel those dollars against the deficit  that this country will continue to experience  in 2008. If you  look at the  budget that was passed by the Democrats, the budget shows a deficit for  this year. So should we be successful  on any of these bills, my amendment  would allow the savings to go against  the deficit and in future years should  we have a surplus, it would actually  allow the surplus to increase.  So it’s a pretty straightforward concept. Most folks back home understand  when they save money in certain areas  on spending, they have that money  available to spend somewhere else, to  put in savings, to reduce debt, to do all  the kinds of things, but under our arcane system here, that money simply  stays with the committee and through  some process in conference gets spent  again should we be successful.  I understand there’s a point of order  that lies against this. I do not intend  to push  it, and I will withdraw my  amendment, but I seek to point this  out one more  time  to anyone who  might be listening at this early hour in  Hawaii or late here on the east coast.  I would also like to get acknowledgment that I’m getting my amendment  out of the way tonight as opposed to  tomorrow when the heavy lifting on  the spending cuts will occur.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.  There was no objection.  AMENDMENTOFFEREDBYMR. SOUDER  ",2007

1758,121,2007-06-27,Mr. SOUDER.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself 3 minutes.  This amendment would continue the  existing ban on public funding for needle exchange programs in Washington,  D.C. We have prohibited this since 1999,  so we’ve done this for 7 years. We generally speaking have had votes in the  House  and Senate  and  voted  overwhelmingly not to have the taxpayers  be heroin dealers.  Intravenous drug use  is associated  with two epidemics, the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C and illicit drug abuse and the  physical, economic and social damages  it does. Needle exchange programs do  not increase drug abuse. They maintain it, they sustain it, they support  the intravenous drug use.  Also, over the years, we can argue  about the studies and we’ve argued on  this on the House floor over and over  about this study and that study. The  best that you can say is studies are inconclusive. In fact, recent studies are  moving to prove what I have alleged in  these  debates  over  the years,  that  there’s no significant impact on HIV  infection, in fact, we merely subsidize  heroin use.  Responsible public health policy and  compassion requires us to meet the primary  illness, not  just  the outward  symptoms of the disease. Addiction is  what fuels HIV risk. Providing needles  to addicts isn’t going to help end their  addiction. It is not compassionate to  enable addicts to continue their addiction. What we need to do is get them  off. For example, D.C. has actually reduced the funding for drug abuse and  addiction treatment. They need to be  focusing on addiction treatment, not  providing free heroin needles.

1801,142,2007-06-27,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, would  the Senator yield for a question?  ",2007
1802,142,2007-06-27,Mrs. FEINSTEIN., I certainly will.  ,2007
1803,142,2007-06-27,Mr. KENNEDY.," From what the Senator said, therefore, what we are doing  on the border is the most extensive  border security in the history of this  country, No. 1; No. 2, with the—am I  not correct on that, that this will be  the most extensive—extensive paid-for  border security in the history of this  country? Am I correct?  ",2007
1804,142,2007-06-27,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Through the Chair  to  the Senator  from Massachusetts,  there is no question about it.  ",2007
1805,142,2007-06-27,Mr. KENNEDY.," Secondly, if this legislation doesn’t go through, we are not  going to have that provision; is that  not correct as well?  ",2007
1806,142,2007-06-27,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Through the Chair  to  the Senator  from Massachusetts,  that is absolutely true. We will have a  continuation of what is, in effect, a silent amnesty.  ",2007
1807,142,2007-06-27,Mr. KENNEDY.," All right. Thirdly, is  the Senator saying this is not only an  issue on border security, but it is an  issue with regard to national security  because we don’t know who those people are and they disappear  into our  country, and those who have spoken  about national security in this country  have urged us to take this action?  ",2007
1808,142,2007-06-27,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," That is absolutely  true. We have no idea who is in this  country and who comes into this country illegally. We have no idea who is in  this country overstaying their visas.  These are the 12 million people who  remain unidentified. This is what we  are trying to do: First, fix the border  as it has never been fixed before. Second, hire the additional Border Patrol,  bringing the total number of agents up  to 20,000. Third, fix interior enforcement. Fourth, provide  for employer  verification documents. No more fraudulent documents. Everybody will have  biometric documents  to be able  to  prove they are, in fact, who they are.  One of the big problems is in a category called OTMs, ‘‘Other Than Mexicans,’’ coming across the border. Because it is so easy to come in, more and  more people from other countries are  going to Mexico first and coming up  through that border, particularly countries from the Middle East. This represents  a  serious  national  security  issue.  ",2007
1809,142,2007-06-27,Mr. KENNEDY., Could the Senator  yield for 2 quick questions?  ,2007
1810,142,2007-06-27,Mrs. FEINSTEIN., I will.  ,2007
1811,142,2007-06-27,Mr. KENNEDY.," So we are talking  about not only national security and  border security, but the Senator is also  talking about worksite security. We  don’t have any worksite security at the  present time. That is the problem with  the 1986 act. We hear a  lot of talk  about it, but that is the problem.  Is the Senator telling us we will have  the most extensive not only border security but worksite security; and beyond that we are going to have 1,000 inspectors to make sure the new security  is going to work; and beyond that, for  the first time, we are going to have a  tamperproof card that will finally give  us the opportunity to get control of our  immigration system?  ",2007
1812,142,2007-06-27,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," The Senator from  Massachusetts  is absolutely  correct.  This bill has three huge chapters called  titles that are devoted to enforcement.  It is extraordinarily important, and it  isn’t going to get done  if this bill  doesn’t pass.  Now, in addition to that, it says—because there is no way to find and deport these individuals because they live  in the shadows and because an overwhelming number of them live a life of  hard work and want to continue to  work and want some hope and opportunity for their family—that if they go  through an extensive process—not an  easy process, not a process of amnesty  in any way, shape or form—as a matter  of fact, they feel the process may be  too  tough  because  they must  go  through an extensive period of paying  fines. For one person, the fines amount  to $8,500 over the first 8 years. They  must learn English. They must show  work documents. They must do this periodically. They must pay taxes. They  must show documents that they have  paid taxes. This is not a pushover by a  long shot.  If they can comply with this, they receive something called a Z visa. That Z  visa eventually, between 8 and 13 years  into the future, will enable them, after  everyone now in the green card line—  after that green card line is expunged—  to get a green card. It is hard. There  are many  hoops  they  will  jump  through. The fines are heavy. But they  say they will do it. The dominant majority say they will do it. That means  they will be documented. That means  the national security problem will end.  Additionally, we are requiring US–  VISIT  to  track people  leaving our  country so we will know if somebody  who is here on a visa actually leaves  the country when their visa expires.  There is a penalty. If they come back  illegally, they will be held and do some  jail time prior to deportation.  The bottom line is this bill also incorporates two other bills. One is a bill  that has been negotiated between farmers and growers and organizations representing  farm  labor,  such  as  the  United Farm Workers, over a substantial period of time. The reason for this  portion of  the bill  is because agriculture in America is dominantly—perhaps 90 percent—undocumented illegal  workers. The reason it is that way is  because American workers will not do  the job. I know that in California because we have tried over the years to  get American workers to do these jobs.  One day I went out to the Salinas  Valley, and I watched row crops being  picked. What I saw was the degree to  which this is stooped labor in the hot  Sun but with a skill. These people  bring a skill. Agriculture workers have  a skill: the way they pick, the way  they sort, the way they pack, the way  they prune. If you watch them, you see  they go from crop to crop. They are not  American citizens. They come  from  other countries. They are the  labor  that puts our food on the table in the  United States of America.  What this bill does is incorporate a  closely negotiated bill called AgJOBS,  which would allow these workers to become documented and, at the end of 8  years, if they carry out their requirements to continue their agricultural  work  for  an  additional  number  of  years, they are then eligible to be first  in this line for a green card.  The  final part of  the bill  is  the  DREAM Act, which  recognizes  that  children, for example, such as the three  Munoz children, or other children who  are brought here illegally and go to  school and earn a degree in college or  serve in our military, can earn a green  card.  So the bill is a compromise bill as  well. People on the other side of the  aisle wanted certain things in this bill.  People on our side of the aisle wanted  certain things in this bill. It was negotiated and the bill was put together. Is  the bill a perfect bill? No. Is it a good  bill? I absolutely believe that it is. I  absolutely believe this Nation will be  better off with this bill. Will the Judiciary Committee have to practice oversight? We have Senator KENNEDY, we  have the Presiding Officer, and members of the Judiciary Committee. I believe very strongly what we should do  is have bimonthly hearings, oversight  hearings into the operation and mechanics of the bill, so that as the bill is  carried out, if there are tweaks that  need to be made, we can make them.  But to fail, at this point in time, is  to continue this situation where 12 million remain unidentified, where they  pose a serious risk to national security, where 700,000 to 800,000 people will  enter our country illegally or overstay  their visas over 10 years, with 7 million  to 8 million additional people here in  undocumented capacity, where 400 to  500 people die every year trying to  cross the Mexican border, and where 4  million people will continue to wait for  a green card. We take these problems  and we try to solve them in this bill.  Now, people who are opposed to the  bill say: I don’t like this. I am going to  vote against the bill. I don’t like that.  I am going to vote against the bill.  Yes, they can do that. Yes, they are entitled to do it, but know what you are  doing when you do it. There will be no  $4.4 billion to enforce the border. There  will be no additional Border Patrol.

1824,184,2007-06-27,Mr. REID.," I don’t want it to go unanswered. This bill, as I mentioned earlier today, is different than what we  did before—$4.4 billion goes to the border for security. It is totally different  than the last bill.  Remember, we are at this point because we only got seven Republican  votes in the prior vote. Now we have  worked together. I was told there were  a lot of people on the Republican side,  if they had the opportunity to have  more amendments, would vote with us.  I am confident that will happen. This  has worked out extremely well.  from  I would say, our work on comprehensive immigration reform has been pretty significant. Due to the man to my  right, and Senator LEAHY, who is not  here, and Senator KENNEDY, we have  had 36 hearings on immigration since 9/  11. That is a lot of hearings. We have  had 6 full days of committee action. We  have had 59 committee amendments.  We have had 21 days of Senate debate  since 2006—21 days, not hours. We have  had  92  floor amendments. We have  worked this thing hard. This is a bill  people should fully understand.  Mr. President, it is my understanding  there is now a unanimous consent in  effect that there will be 10 minutes of  debate on the first amendment, is that  true, equally divided?  ",2007

1830,184,2007-06-27,The PRESIDING OFFICER., Is there  objection to that arrangement?  ,2007

1845,184,2007-06-27,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  worked with the Senator from Texas,  now, 10 years up close. I do not like to  oppose her amendment, but in this case  I believe I must. This is an issue we debated  in many conversations during  the process of drafting this legislation.  I was opposed to the touchback idea  and I am skeptical about it now. However, in the spirit of compromise, we  went forward with the touchback that  we have in the base bill, specifically in  President,  CRAIG title VI. We included some important  safeguards to make sure it is workable.  This amendment  from  the distinguished Senator from Texas actually  does away with  this by creating a  touchback requirement before people  get their full Z visa. What immigrant  is going to show up and register for a  program if he has to take his chances  on  leaving  the country and coming  back in before he gets some kind of immigration status? What immigrant is  going to report to deport?  I wager that many, if not most, will  simply stay underground and try to  keep their heads down for as long as  possible. They have built  lives here,  they have families, they own homes,  and they have jobs they want to keep.  Very  few undocumented  immigrants  are going to show up for a program  that offers no certainty they will actually be able to legalize their status.  What this amendment does is essentially front load the requirement that  makes the program unworkable from  both an agency and an applicant perspective. Requiring consular officers to  steal themselves for a flood of applications, 8 to 10 years down the line, is one  thing. Requiring them to gear up for  adjudication of this in-person application in the next 2 years following registration is a very different story.  I hope  the  body will  defeat  the  amendment.  Those  of  us—Senator  and  I  and  others—who have  worked on the AgJOBS program believe that the agriculture jobs program  is the way to go. It is negotiated by  farmers, by unions, by growers, and it  has a specific requirement.  I know the Senator does not touch  this specific requirement, but the main  problem with the amendment is requiring this touchback so soon, before people have acquired any kind of legal status. They register and then in 2 years,  they would have to go and perform this  touchback.  We believe it strikes at the heart of  the bill and urge a ‘‘no’’ vote.  I yield the floor.  ",2007

1847,184,2007-06-27,Mrs. HUTCHISON.," Mr. President, I,  like my colleague from California, do  not remember being on opposite sides  on an issue such as this before. But she  has brought up a key point that I think  it is important for us to address. She  says, What immigrant is going to report to deport? What she is asking is,  what is the incentive of an illegal immigrant to come forward and say they  are illegal and they want to get right  with the process to become legal? That  is  a  very  important  question  that  many  people  in  our  country  have  asked. Who is going to do that?  Here is the incentive. First, the secure ID that is provided in the amendment allows exit and reentry. It is a  tamperproof ID already, and  it does  allow the exit to finalize the Z, or Z-A  status, and it allows the reentry.  The secure card is issued first. It is  temporary until it is finalized because  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:23 Jun 28, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A27JN6.016 S27JNPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

1849,198,2007-06-27,Mr. KENNEDY.," If the Chair would let  me know when I have 1 minute.  Mr. President, maybe we could take a  moment and look at those words that  are written in stone right above the  Vice President’s chair there: e pluribus  unum, meaning one out of many. One  out of many. That is the desire, that is  the hope, that  is the dream of this  country: one out of many.  Many come from different traditions,  backgrounds, and experience, but we  all are one country with one history  and one destiny—not with the Bond  amendment, not with the Bond amendment.  The lines written at the Statue of  Liberty are:  Give me  your  tired,  your  poor,  your  huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the  wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send  these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me. I  lift my lamp beside the golden door!  That is right, as long as those individuals are working and who will never  become citizens, who will never have  that right to become a part of the  American dream, and once you stop  working, out of the country you go.  Better gather up all of your belongings,  because you are going to be out of status, and out of status means you can be  subject to deportation.  You can  imagine what  that  individual is going to say to their employer  when  the employer  says: Sure, you  have worked 40 hours. You work 50  hours, 60 hours, and bring your wife in  and make sure she works overtime this  week as well; otherwise, you are out of  status. You are out of here.  That is what the Bond amendment  would do to Americans. One America  that has rights and privileges, and to a  second group  in America  they  say:  Once we wring out of you the last bit of  sweat that you can give to some employer, you are finished, you are out of  status, you are deportable.  That  isn’t what  this  country  is  about. Maybe we don’t like the fact  that people are not satisfied with the  regime we have given or recommended  in this legislation that says: You go to  the back of the line. You came here because you wanted to work, because you  wanted to provide for your family; you  came here, and you are at church on  the weekends; and you came here and  your son or daughter is serving in Iraq  or Afghanistan. But we say: OK, you go  to the end of the line, pay a fee, learn  English, and you have to demonstrate  that you are working and you are going  to become a good American. That isn’t  good enough for some.  Well, Mr. President, this creates the  two Americas, which I think all of us  understand is not what this Nation is  about. That is the result of the Bond  amendment, and I think it would be a  major step backward. We can imagine  the resentment and hostility that will  seethe and grow with generations that  come with their families when they see  them exploited. Talk about a danger  and social dynamite  in our society,  this amendment will breed that. We  don’t need that or want it, Mr. President. We should not have it. I hope the  amendment is not accepted.  I reserve the remainder of my time.  ",2007

1852,198,2007-06-27,Mr. BOND.," Mr. President, my colleague  from Massachusetts made  a  very powerful statement on behalf of  those who came here, but he kind of  forgot an important distinction. There  are those who come here legally and  those who come here illegally. We are  talking about the illegals. With the argument so forcefully and persuasively  made by my colleague from Massachusetts, if you took that argument to its  end result, then there should not be  immigration laws. We should not have  a process for going for citizenship because anybody who wanted to come in  could.  We have changed those laws. We have  provided laws, and the people we are  talking about have come here illegally  to work. If they wanted to become citizens, there is a process. If they join the  military, I strongly believe they should  become citizens.  But  if they come  illegally  just to  work, then they have not earned citizenship like all of the others do, like  my ancestors and the ancestors of almost every Member of this body. We  are all  immigrants, but we did not  come here illegally and expect to get  citizenship. Therefore, Mr. President, I  strongly urge my colleagues, if you believe there is a difference between people who come legally and people who  come illegally, to support the Bond division or proposal, vote against the  motion to table.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts  is recognized.  ",2007
1853,198,2007-06-27,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, we  have broken borders. The 1986 act had  no enforcement mechanism, and that  was under a Republican administration. We are not bringing that up. We  have 121⁄2million immigrants. You can  say we are going to ship them back,  and  it will take $250 billion and 25  years to be able to do it. Buses will  stretch from Los Angeles to New York  and back again. Are we going to do  that? No, we are going to take another  route and just exploit them and not do  what  is  in  this  legislation, which  makes  them  pay  a  fine  and  demonstrate that they are going to work  hard and learn English and provide for  their family and give something back  to America, like they do when their  sons and daughters serve in Iraq and  Afghanistan. You will be able to stay  here under the Bond amendment, but  you are going to work for an employer.  When you get tired of working, we are  going to report to the INS that you are  out of status, and out you are going to  go, lock, stock, and barrel. It will be  just sweat labor here.  We are going to have two Americas.  You may not like our solution, but it is  preferable to this alternative, which  will create a permanent underclass. I  think it would be a mistake.

1862,205,2007-06-27,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President, I am  going to speak generally about the legislation before us.  There is some concern that I have expressed—not so much on the floor but  in other public comments I made—that  I am one of about 22 or 23 Members of  the Senate who were here in 1986 when  we passed amnesty, as is in this bill as  well. I was one of those Senators who  voted for amnesty at that particular  time. At that particular time, we had  maybe 1 million to 3 million people  cross the border illegally and who were  here  illegally. We  all  thought—and  there have been plenty of references to  statements made in the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD 20 years ago—that if we were  to adopt amnesty, it would settle this  problem once and for all, do it once and  (Mr.  for all. You know, I believed that. But  do you know what I found out maybe 5  or 10 years ago? When you reward illegality, you get more of it. Now the  guesstimate is that we have 12 million  people here illegally. They are not illegal people, but they came here illegally.  I think I have an obligation to consider the votes I made before and, if  they are wrong, not make that mistake  again. You know, it is a little like the  chaos you would have if you didn’t respect and enforce red lights and stop  signs. You would have chaos at intersections and accidents. Wherever you  don’t enforce the rule of law, those are  the things that happen. You need social  cohesion,  and  social  cohesion  comes from respect for the rule of law  in our country.  So it seems to me that, as we go  down this road, what we ought to do is  concentrate on legal immigration, the  reforms we are bringing to the H–1B  program, the reforms we are bringing  in the way of a temporary worker program. People would rather come here  legally rather than illegally, I believe.  I know it is not very satisfying to people to hear that we have 12 million people in the underground. The point is  that if people could come here legally  to work, they would soon, one by one,  by attrition, replace people who are  here illegally, I believe.  I am not one who wants to make that  mistake  again. That  is why  I  am  weighing very heavily the issue of what  we do with amnesty or what other people who don’t like the word ‘‘amnesty’’  would say is earned citizenship, guest  worker program, those sorts of things  that are covering up really what we are  doing.  I say if it walks like a duck and it  quacks like a duck, it is a duck. If it  looks like amnesty, it is amnesty. That  is the bottom line. We ought to learn  the lesson that in 1986 it didn’t work. I  don’t think it will work now. I am 73  years old, so obviously I am not going  to be here 20 years from now when we  have another immigration bill. But I  should not make that problem so that  a successor of mine has to deal with 25  million people being here illegally as  opposed to the 12 million now or the 1  to 3 million before.  I yield the floor and whatever time I  didn’t use I will retain or whatever is  done with the surplus.  ",2007

1868,205,2007-06-27,Mr. KYL.," Mr. President, I appreciate  the comments of  the Senator  from  Iowa. He was absolutely assured by  people on our side that he would be allowed to bring up an amendment, and I  am glad we have been able to do that.  He certainly should be afforded that  right.  With  that  said, however,  I  can’t  match his opposition to the bill with  his amendment. If you want to assure  that the bill will not work, then adopt  the  Grassley  amendment.  It  substitutes the existing title III  in the  bill, which is a very good title to ensure employee verification, with a potpourri of provisions that, frankly, look  a lot like the status quo and will not  ensure that employees are adequately  checked to ensure they are entitled to  be employed.  For example, the Grassley amendment provides that none of the current  employees are checked. In other words,  the only people who have to be checked  are future employees, so all the people  working today, including all the illegal  immigrants working today, don’t have  to  be  checked  under  the Grassley  amendment.  Secondly, amazingly, the only way to  physically verify that the person seeking the job is, in fact, the person with  the identity entitled to be employed is  with a photograph. Nobody  is proposing that we fingerprint people to  get jobs, and that leaves the photograph as the best identity document.  The bill provides that either a passport  with a photograph or a driver’s license  with a photograph be the document.  You have to verify that the person  standing in front of you is the person  to whom the document has been issued  and the rightful owner of the Social Security number he has given you.  The Grassley amendment does not require that a photograph be used in the  identification process. This is one of  the first things that was recommended  by the 9/11 Commission, to have a secure document with a photograph with  which you can confirm identity.  Third, and this is amazing, and I honestly don’t understand why this would  be in the Senator’s amendment, but it  gives  foreign temporary workers the  right to file legal complaints against  employers who hire American workers  instead—basically, to file a discrimination complaint based upon  the  fact  that they were not hired.  Current  law does not permit temporary workers  to  file  these  complaints. The basic bill would not allow  workers to file these complaints. But  the amendment does  this by eliminating current laws that prohibit temporary workers from filing a discrimination  claim based on  immigration  status.  Next, one of the key things we did  after 9/11 was to ensure that Government agencies could share information  with each other. When we determined  the best way to ensure people are legally eligible to work, we quickly understood that we had to have sharing of  information from the Social Security  Administration, from the Department  of Homeland Security, even, in some  cases, from the Internal Revenue Service. Unless these agencies are able to  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:23 Jun 28, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00069 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G27JN6.064 S27JNPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

1870,219,2007-06-27,Ms. SNOWE.," Mr President, today I  honor an exceptional small business  from my home State of Maine that is  striving to employ more Mainers and  revive tourism in one of Maine’s hidden  natural treasures. The New England  Outdoors Center of Millinocket  is a  multifaceted  ecotourism  and  recreational sports business and a wonderful example of entrepreneurial spirit in  Maine.  Local  residents  of  the  Millinocket region and tourists, who  come from far and wide to see Maine’s  splendor and beauty, enjoy the Outdoors Center’s diversity of services. In  addition,  the Center’s  owner, Matt  Polstein, is working to add a resort to  his business which would bring additional jobs to the Katahdin region.  The New England Outdoors Center is  an all-season facility that consists of a  snowmobile business, the River Drivers  restaurant, and a white water rafting  enterprise. The Outdoors Center provides a gateway to Baxter State Park  and the spectacular Mount Katahdin,  the Appalachian Trail’s northern terminus. The Center has won numerous  commendations throughout its decades  of operation, including a Maine Tourism award. It is a member of the Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce, the  Maine Tourism Association, the Maine  Snowmobile Association,  and many  other groups. Matt Polstein and the  New England Outdoors Center’s  endeavors greatly benefit the local economy, which has recently been suffering  due to a slump in visitors to Baxter  State Park.  In light of this decline in tourism,  Matt Polstein’s vision of building the  new Ktaadn Resorts  on Hammond  Ridge is particularly critical in bringing people back to the Katahdin region  and to all of Maine. Mr. Polstein’s $65  million proposal evidences his commitment and determination to create new  jobs for Mainers and to contribute to  the growth of Millinocket’s regional  economy. The plan has garnered the  support of the Millinocket community  and its leaders, as well as the unanimous endorsement of Maine’s Land Use  Regulation Commission, which oversees the state’s planning and zoning for  plantations,  townships,  and unorganized areas without local governance.  This  forward-thinking proposal  for a  new resort is one of the largest resort  proposals in Maine’s Unorganized Territory history—a true victory for all  involved. Conscious of  the  environment, Mr. Polstein is seeking to grow  crops and livestock for use at the resort and in the community. The new  Ktaadn Resorts will be an extraordinary  feat when  finished, complete  with a state-of-the-art conference center, a  lodge, rental cabins, and restaurants. The Resort  is expected to  create at least 100 new jobs and to shed  light on Millinocket as a hub of tourism in Maine and New England.  It is vital that we respect our natural  surroundings, and Matt Polstein’s proposal does just that. It is a bright example of the kind of intelligent planning  that benefits Maine’s economy  while protecting the State’s natural  environment. Mount Katahdin  is  a  shining example of what makes Maine  beautiful, and Mr. Polstein’s dedication  to the improvement of his community  exemplifies what makes Maine people  so special. I commend Matt Polstein  for his public service as a city councillor in Millinocket, his current business ventures that provide accommodations and  services  to  tourists year-  round, and for his smart and bright entrepreneurial  savvy with  the  future  Ktaadn Resorts. I wish Mr. Polstein  and everyone at the New England Outdoors Center continued prosperity, and  a successful completion to the Ktaadn  Resorts.∑  f  KEAN UNIVERSITY CHAMPIONS  ∑",2007
1871,219,2007-06-27,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President, I  wish to pay tribute to the Kean University Cougars baseball team’s dramatic  victory in the 2007 NCAA Division III  National Championships. Bringing joy  to the more than 13,000 Kean University students and all of the Cougar fans  in Union, NJ, Kean University capped  off  their  impressive  season with  a  thrilling 5-to-4 victory in the 10th inning of the championship game. The  victory ushered in the Cougars’ first  baseball championship title and was  the  culmination  of  an  inspiring  undefeated run through the postseason.  Throughout  the  season  the  team  played with courage and determination. Boasting a roster with 28 New  Jerseyans, the Cougars finished in first  place in the New Jersey Athletic Conference, NJAC, with  an  impressive  record of 15 wins and only 3 losses, best  in the conference. Although the Cougars fell to the College of New Jersey  in the conference championships, the  team recovered quickly and  finished  the season with an overall record of 43  wins and  8  losses and  the national  championship.  Championship  baseball  requires  strong leadership, and under coach Neil  Ioviero, the Cougars played team baseball that allowed them to realize their  full potential. With the help of assistant  coaches  Jamie  Ioviero,  Lewis  France, Jack Nagy, Francisco Romero,  and Frank Beckhorn,  the  coaching  staff created a winning environment  and offered the guidance that allowed  the Cougars to excel on the field.  The entire Cougars squad played with  heart and the championship was truly  a team effort. I would like to congratulate and commend all of the players on  the Kean University 2007 Division III  Championship Team: Maikel De La  Rosa, Ryan Clark, Joseph Augustine,  Mike  Shymanski,  Keith  Kwiatek,  Aaron Richard, Joseph D’Andrea, Eric  Ammirata,  Perry  Schatzow,  Chris  Carrano, Thomas Paglione, Brandon  Aich, Mike Manganiello, Kevin O’Neill,  Kyle Murphy, Andrew Cupido, Colin  Feneis,  Matt  Donaghue,  Derek  Gianakas,  Mark  Blevins,  Dan  Mattonelli,  Matt  Grinkevich,  Joe  Rizzo, Tim Lowe, Daniel Zeffiro, Joe  Bartlinski, Matt Merrigan, Nick Nolan  and Nick Cesare.  Mr. President, on behalf of the State  of New Jersey I am honored to congratulate the Cougars for their NCAA  Division  III  Championship  season.  They played hard and displayed an admirable commitment  to competition  and sportsmanship that instills a sense  of pride in the students of Kean University, the team’s fans, and the people of  my State.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO VIC ATIYEH  ∑",2007
1872,219,2007-06-27,Mr. SMITH.," Mr. President, there is a  word Senators traditionally use when  referring to one of our male colleagues  on the floor of the Senate. That word is  ‘‘gentleman.’’ It  is a word that you  don’t hear often in today’s society, as  many consider it too old-fashioned. I  disagree. Calling someone a gentleman  is one of the highest compliments one  can give.  I pay tribute to the career and accomplishments of a truly outstanding  gentleman—the former Governor of Oregon Vic Atiyeh. Anyone involved in  the Oregon political arena over the  past  several decades, Republican or  Democrat, will  tell you  about Vic  Atiyeh’s kind and courteous nature,  his personal integrity, and his civility  in a business that is all too often uncivil.  On Wednesday, July 18, 2007, Oregonians will gather at the Portland International Airport to officially dedicate  the  international  concourse  as  the  ‘‘Governor Victor G. Atiyeh  International Concourse.’’ This is an outstanding and truly fitting honor. During his eight years as Oregon’s Governor, Vic Atiyeh implemented policies  that transformed Oregon into a hub for  international commerce. Long before  the term ‘‘global economy’’ was part of  our lexicon, Vic understood the importance of opening Oregon’s doors  to  international commerce, tourism, and  cultural exchange programs.

Although some of my colleagues in  the Senate may not have heard of the  Emerald Ash Borer, it is a destructive  pest that poses a significant threat to  our forests and urban and residential  landscapes.  Some of my colleagues are all too familiar with the destructive power of  EAB because of the speed with which it  can move from State to State and the  extensive damage  it can cause to a  State’s ash tree population. Before this  species was discovered in Illinois, I had  been following its deadly march across  the Midwest and had discussed the dangers of EAB with my colleagues from  Michigan and Indiana.  The emerald-green beetle was most  likely brought to North America  in  solid wood packing material from Asia  about 10 years ago. Our new flat world  means that  in addition to  improved  global communications and more foreign trade and foreign travel, we are  also  witnessing  the  international  movement of bugs like this beetle.  The beetle was  first discovered  in  Michigan in 2002. Since then, the beetle  has killed 20 million of the State’s  more than 700 million ash trees. Since  then, the beetle has been found in Indiana, Ohio, and Maryland. The tiny beetle kills with astonishing speed. During  the mating season, the ash borer lays  its  larva under the bark of the ash  trees. When they hatch, hundreds of  these beetles feed on the inner bark of  the ash tree, disrupting the tree’s ability to transport water and nutrients  through the tree.  Within 2 to 3 years of introduction,  the beetles will destroy a host ash tree  and spread. Each beetle has a half mile  flying range, widening the beetle’s infestation every year in expanding concentric  circles. The  beetle  is  also  spread artificially and often unknowingly by campers and others who transport ash firewood and thus introduce  the beetle to new environments.  Managing this deadly beetle is a significant challenge. At an average cost  of $500 per tree removal and a couple of  hundred dollars to replant a tree to  maintain  forest and urban canopies,  this bug presents a serious economic  impact on our communities. Additional  costs are incurred for equipment, marshalling yards, and survey activities.  While the Federal Government administers  a  national EAB  program  through USDA-APHIS, many of  the  costs of managing EAB are borne by  municipalities and homeowners. For  example, the city of Woodridge, IL, a  town of 30,000, is home to 8,000 public  trees, 25 percent of which are ash. If  the Emerald Ash Borer were to infest  the  public-owned  ash  trees  of  Woodridge, the cost of removing and  replanting Woodridge’s trees would be  about $1.8 million.  One of the missing pieces in the Federal Emerald Ash Borer, EAB, Program  is a mechanism to help municipalities  defray the costs of performing EAB  prevention duties normally performed  by  the Federal Government. These  costs include managing the EAB population by surveying trees, removing infested  trees, and  replacing  removed  trees. The expenses associated with  these  activities  include  purchasing  bucket trucks, tub grinders, and replacement trees and renting or leasing  space for marshalling yards.  The legislation would create a low-  interest revolving loan fund for communities  for the purchase of capital  equipment and replacement trees within  quarantine  areas.  Communities  would have a 20-year window to repay  the loan. In addition, the bill would  allow  states  to contract with  local  units of government to perform EAB  duties.  Ash trees are among the most commonly found trees in our forests and  urban canopies. Wisconsin is home to  more than 700 million of them. They  make up 20 percent of the tree population of beautiful Madison, WI. The  beetle threatens billions of ash trees in  North America. Losing our ash trees  would incur costs that are difficult to  measure. Homeowners deeply love their  trees and value the shade and aesthetic  beauty they add. Ash trees are a part of  our wildlife habitat and diverse environment.  In my State of Illinois, the beetle has  been  found  in multiple  locations,  in  several parts of both Kane County and  Cook County. Experts  say  that unchecked, this beetle could threaten ash  trees nationwide on a scale equal to  the Dutch Elm Disease, which  destroyed more than half of the elm trees  in the northern United States.  It is a problem of significant magnitude and I hope my colleagues will  join me in this effort to control and  eradicate the Emerald Ash Borer.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 1717  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

1876,2,2007-07-10,Mrs.  BLACKBURN.," Mr.  Speaker,  since we have all been gone, the Glasgow Airport has been bombed, Piccadilly Circus in London was the site of  an attempted terrorist attack, another  attempt on a hospital, and within 48  hours, the British Intelligence Agency  rounded up several credible suspects.  Their use of  intelligence  should be  commended. They have faced terrorist  attacks on their soil for over 30 years  and put in place the tools to deal with  these.  On the other hand, it seems the liberal leadership of this Congress wants  to backtrack in our attempts to track  and survey potential terrorists by scaling back our critical intelligence-gathering efforts.  They took issue with the program designed to monitor phone calls from potential terrorists. They railed against  the PATRIOT Act. They even shifted  funds  from critical  intelligence-gathering programs to put it into a slush  fund  to  study global warming. Mr.  Speaker, the last time I checked, global warming  didn’t have  one  single  thing to do with putting a bomb in Piccadilly Circus or trying to blow up the  JFK airport. Global warming didn’t  bomb the USS Cole or take down the  Twin Towers. Climate change can be  studied, but it need not be done at the  expense of human intelligence needed  to help eliminate  international  terrorism. We need to adjust our priorities. It’s time to get to work.  f  BORDER CROSSINGS AND TRAFFIC  TICKETS  (Mr. POE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute.)  ",2007
1877,2,2007-07-10,Mr. POE.," Mr. Speaker, news from the  lawless southern border: Homeland Security is claiming illegal entry is decreasing. According to their reports,  the number of illegals arrested on the  Mexico-U.S. border has decreased almost 25 percent.  Armed with these statistics, these  bureaucrats are thus claiming  fewer  illegals are trying to sneak into the  United States. Interesting enough, just  last month the Homeland Security Secretary said, while he was lobbying for  the now defeated Senate amnesty plan,  that he cannot secure the U.S. borders.  Now he claims  illegal crossings are  down because apprehensions on  the  border are down. That is like saying  there are fewer cars on the road because the police are issuing fewer traffic tickets.  The American people are not fooled  by this statistical game. Rather than  claiming these glowing statistics mean  that all is well on the southern front,  Homeland Security should stop issuing  propaganda statements and give the  border protectors the support, equipment, and manpower to protect the  border from infiltration. Homeland Security must quit being delightfully ignorant of the truth and not claim border victory because it issues fewer traffic tickets.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  ",2007

The purpose of H.R. 1904, as introduced by our colleague from New Mexico (Mrs. WILSON), is to provide assistance to the State of New Mexico for  the  development  of  comprehensive  State water plans.  The bill directs the Secretary of the  Interior to provide New Mexico with  technical assistance and grants for the  development of a comprehensive State  water plan. This includes a survey and  mapping of water  resources  in New  Mexico, a study of groundwater quality  and quantity, and a study on the relationships  between  groundwater  and  surface water in the State.  A key understanding of our most precious resource is required if we are to  meet the water supply needs of our  growing communities and our environment. H.R. 1904 seeks just such an understanding from New Mexico.  I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 1904.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

1892,23,2007-07-10,Ms. PRYCE of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker, we  have no other requests for time. Let  me close by addressing the concerns of  my colleague that were just raised. The  reforms in many areas of this bill far  outweigh the compromise of the committee machinations that were made  over in the Senate.  Believe me, it is no small point, and  it is one not lost on me. Our product, I  believe, is far superior. The Senate’s,  as the gentleman points out, is weaker  than ours.  But I believe that the colloquy between Chairman FRANKand Chairman  will help us  resolve  that.  Chairman FRANK says it is the intent  of this Congress that there is a consensus on the CFIUS, and he agreed to  work with Chairman SKELTONand the  Defense Authorization Act to correct  this.  But taken as a whole, this bill is far  superior than current law. It must be  enacted, and the sooner the better. Let  me reiterate, the rest of the world is  watching us here today.  We are passing a balanced bill that  does not forget the importance of FDI  to our economy, but it protects our  ports and our homeland to the extent  that this Congress is able to do it.  I believe that we must act quickly.  We have been stymied for a year now.  We can’t afford to send the wrong message. It means that American jobs will  be lost, and we will be no safer for prolonging this process. This bill protects  our economy, but also the ultimate  protection is to our homeland. I urge  passage of this bipartisan bill.  ",2007
1893,23,2007-07-10,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  fully support  H.R. 556, the Foreign Investment and National  Security Act of 2007.  Greater oversight is needed regarding foreign  investment  in  the United States, and  I  want to commend Chairman FRANKand Mrs.  MALONEY for the work they have done in bringing about this legislation. The Committee on  Foreign Affairs has significant jurisdictional interest  in  this  legislation, and  I was  very  pleased at the manner in which our committees have worked on H.R. 556 as it moved  through the legislative process.  Mr. Speaker, I want to call attention to two  critical  issues. First,  the  treatment  that  the  United States provides to foreign investors is  often not reciprocated to United States companies who wish  to  invest  in  foreign markets,  which threatens bilateral investment relations.  The procedures  laid out  in  this bill  for  the  interagency Committee  on Foreign  Investments in the United States, or CFIUS, allow  for a responsible and fair assessment of foreign direct investment into the United States.  These procedures, however, stand  in stark  contrast to actions taken by some foreign governments, where  expropriations  of  assets,  often in the energy sector, have occurred arbitrarily, without justification, and without full and  fair compensation for United States investors.  Mr. Speaker, we must continue to seek to  ensure that U.S. investors are treated fairly in  foreign markets, especially when a transaction  being evaluated by CFIUS is for a company  whose primary place of business is in a country  that does not allow  foreign direct  investment from the United States in the same business sector as that of the covered transaction.  In this way, we can seek to ensure that foreign governments honor their commitments in  international agreements and provide for a fair  and  friendly  investment  climate  for United  States  companies.  I am pleased  that  the  gentlelady from New York agrees with me on  this score and that the House reports accompanying H.R.  556  address  this  important  issue.  Second, the impact of foreign investments  on national security must be considered when  reviewing foreign investments into the United  States. I am pleased that the Financial Services Committee recognizes the seriousness of  how transactions reviewed by CFIUS can impact our national security. The Committee report on H.R. 556 makes clear that Congress  expects  the acquisitions of U.S. companies,  including energy assets, by  foreign governments or companies controlled by foreign governments, will be reviewed closely for their national security impact. I fully endorse this view  and believe  that  the United States must remain vigilant in protecting our national security  interests.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  ",2007
1894,23,2007-07-10,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 556, the ‘‘Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007’’. As our Nation  pursues the laudable dual goals of free and  fair  flows of capital and  trade  in  the global  economy,  it must remain ever vigilant of  its  own security. Understanding  this, H.R. 556  amends existing law to strengthen the process  by which  the Federal Government performs  national security-related reviews of foreign investments in the United States.  First and  foremost,  this bill establishes  in  statute the membership of the Committee on  Foreign  Investment  in  the United States,  CFIUS. H.R. 556 broadens  the  factors  that  CFIUS must consider during reviews of proposed  foreign  investments  in  the United  States. This includes the bill’s express intent  that critical energy  infrastructure-related aspects of national security not be ignored in the  CFIUS  review  process.  I  am  particularly  pleased with this provision, as well as the establishment in the bill of adding both the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce as permanent members of CFIUS. In  short,  the Committee on Energy and Commerce appreciates  the emphasis  laid by  the  bill on issues that fall squarely within our jurisdiction.  Lastly,  I note my support  for  the bill’s requirement  that  the  Inspector General of  the  Department of  the Treasury  investigate why  that Department has not complied with reporting requirements related to potential industrial  espionage or coordinated strategies by foreign  parties with respect to U.S. critical technology,  as is required under current law. This underscores my strong belief  that Congressional  oversight is a necessary component in assuring that the laws are properly and thoroughly  carried out by the Federal Government.  I do have concerns regarding what I believe  are several shortcomings in H.R. 556, when  compared to the bill originally passed by the  House in February of this year. I am troubled  that  there  is no provision  to designate vice  chairmen of CFIUS—which,  in  the bill originally passed by the House, would have been  comprised of  the Secretaries of Commerce  and Homeland Security—and instead replaces  it with ‘‘lead agencies,’’ to which the responsibility for performing national security reviews  would now mainly be delegated. This has the  lamentable consequence of hindering the thorough participation of the Department of Commerce  in  the CFIUS review process, something  for which my colleagues on  the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce advocated during their hearing  on CFIUS reform in July 2006.  Additionally, H.R. 556 now contains weaker  provisions related to the collection of evidence  in national security reviews,  the approval of  such  reviews, as well as  reporting  requirements to the Congress about them. For example, while H.R. 556 originally directed CFIUS  to submit reports to the Congress on all actions related to covered transactions, the bill  now only provides for reports to be submitted  to  the Congress upon  request. Also,  I am  alarmed that H.R. 556 no longer protects the  Federal Government from liability for losses incurred by parties during CFIUS reviews. Such  an omission may dissuade  the Government  from prosecuting thorough reviews for fear of  being sued  for  remuneration by parties  to  CFIUS-covered transactions.  Although  I have chided  the bill  for what  I  perceive to be its most apparent weaknesses,  I have always maintained that the desire for  perfect  legislation  should  not  impede  the  progress of good  legislation.  I believe H.R.  556 is good legislation that will contribute to  the improvement of the CFIUS. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 556.  ",2007

1896,30,2007-07-10,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume for  these closing remarks.  I agree with HOWARDCOBLE, the gentleman from North Carolina, that our  Nation’s court system and those who  work there must function in a safe and  professional environment, and that is  what we are improving in this measure.  We have worked together in great harmony and cooperation, and the measure helps in a substantial way to promote better security for our judiciary  and other court personnel, and I urge  our colleagues to support the passage  of this critical measure.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I rise in strong support of H.R. 660, the ‘‘Court  Security Improvement Act of 2007.’’ This legislation will go a long way toward enhancing the  security and  integrity of our  judicial system  and the able men and women who comprise  the Federal judiciary.  Mr. Speaker, let me quote the Chief Justice  of the Texas Supreme Court: ‘‘Our democracy  and the rule of law depend upon safe and secure courthouses.’’ That is because an independent  judiciary  is essential  for a  regime  based on the rule of law. Nothing can do more  to undermine the independence of the judiciary than the very real threat of physical harm  to members of the judiciary or their families to  intimidate or retaliate.  In 1979, U.S. District  Court Judge John Wood, Jr., was fatally shot  outside of his home by assassin Charles  Harrelson. The murder  contract had been  placed by Texas drug lord Jamiel Chagra, who  was awaiting trial before the judge.  In 1988, U.S. District Court Judge Richard  Daronco was murdered  at  his  house  by  Charles Koster, the father of the unsuccessful  plaintiff in a discrimination case. The following  year, U.S. Circuit Court Judge Richard Vance  was killed by a letter bomb sent to his home.  The letter bomb was attributed to racist animus against Judge Vance for writing an opinion reversing a lower-court ruling to lift an 18-  year  desegregation  order  from  the Duval  County, Florida schools.  In this age of the global war on terror, the  danger faced by Federal judges, judicial officers, and court personnel is real, as illustrated  by the three murders noted above. The recent  and tragic murder of U.S. District Court Judge  Joan Humphrey Letkow’s husband and mother  reminds us that the danger has not abated.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 660 provides a  three-  pronged  legislative  response  to  the security  challenges facing our judicial institutions and  personnel. First, it directs the U.S. Marshals  Service to consult with the Judicial Conference  regarding the security requirements for the judicial branch, in order to improve the implementation of security measures needed to protect judges, court employees, law enforcement  officers, jurors and other members of the public who are regularly in Federal courthouses.  The bill also extends authority to redact information relating  to  family members  from a  Federal judge’s disclosure statements required  by the Ethics in Government Act and removes  the sunset provision from the redaction authority, thus making the redaction authority permanent.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 660 also enhances the  security and protection of  judicial personnel  and their families by making it a criminal offense  to maliciously  record a  fictitious  lien  against a Federal  judge or Federal  law enforcement officer. This new crime and punishment is intended to deter individuals from attempting  to  intimidate and harass Federal  judges and employees by  filing  false  liens  against their real and personal property.  The bill also makes it a crime to publish on  the  Internet  restricted personal  information  concerning  judges,  law enforcement, public  safety officers, jurors, witnesses, or other officers in any U.S. Court. The penalty for a violation is a maximum term of imprisonment of 5  years. Additionally, the bill increases the maximum penalty for killing or attempting to kill a  witness, victim, or informant to obstruct justice  or in retaliation for their testifying or providing  information to law enforcement by increasing  maximum penalties.  All in all, Mr. Speaker, this bill makes a substantial contribution to the enhancement of security of  judicial  institutions and personnel.  I  urge all members to join me in supporting this  beneficial legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2007

SEC.  3. RECOGNITION OF NOTARIZATIONS  STATE COURTS.  IN  Each court that operates under the jurisdiction of a State shall recognize any lawful  notarization made by a notary public  licensed or commissioned under the laws of a  State other than the State where the court  is located if—  (1) such notarization occurs in or affects  interstate commerce; and  (2)(A) a seal of office, as symbol of the notary public’s authority, is used in the notarization; or  (B) in the case of an electronic record, the  seal information is securely attached to, or  logically  associated with,  the  electronic  record so as to render the record tamper-resistant.

1903,30,2007-07-10,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker,  this  measure  is a  commonsense  requirement with respect to the process of notarizing documents that occur in every  State, every city, every county. And  what we do in H.R. 1979 is simply to require Federal and State courts to recognize documents lawfully notarized in  any State of the Union when interstate  commerce is, in fact, involved.  As we all know, notary publics play a  critical role in ensuring that the signer  of a document is, indeed, who he or she  claims to be and that the person has  willingly and without coercion signed  the document. By performing these two  tasks, the notary public serves as an  indispensable  first  line  of  defense  against fraudulent acts and other manipulations of contracts and other documents.

1904,44,2007-07-10,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," Mr. Speaker,  today I would like to discuss with the  Members here assembled and those listening on C–SPAN and those who will  be reading the CONGRESSIONALRECORD  an issue that may well be determined  here on the House floor in the next few  weeks, at least perhaps in this session  if not in the next few weeks. It is an  issue that will fundamentally alter and  I would say dramatically diminish a  constitutionally protected  right and  will have tremendous long-term consequences for our country; yet, very  few people in this country know that  this issue is coming before us. Very few  of our Members even understand that  an issue of this significance will be discussed here. But there will be a fight,  and there is an issue of great importance that will emerge here in the not-  too-distant future.  The fight over this issue of course is  not a new fight. In the late 1990s, similar attempts were made at what will be  attempted  in  the  next  few weeks.  Those attempts were made, but they  were  defeated. They were  defeated  after  the public was mobilized, and  powerful forces that were at play here  in our Nation’s Capital were defeated.  Without the public mobilizing against  this particular change that was being  proposed by the corporate elite here in  Washington, our system of technology  in the United States would have been  dramatically  impacted and the well-  being of our people in the long run  would be condemned.  The battle, which took place in the  1990s, lasted for years. Corporate pressure was brought to bear, and every attempt was made to accomplish what I  consider  to  be  an  insidious  goal  through stealth, and it was being done  in a way that would keep as low a profile as possible. We see that happening  today. Very few of our Members know  that there is an issue of this magnitude  coming before us, but special interests  are already at play. We see people, we  see organizations being well financed  to come here and talk to us about technology  issues, not realizing the real  purpose of these organizations and the  financing behind them is to push forward a change that will dramatically  impact America’s ability  to be  the  technological leader of the world and  dramatically implicate our innovators  and our inventors.  The American people, however, back  in the 1990s, once alerted and made  aware of the significance to our country of the changes that were being proposed, stood up and fought the good  fight and beat back this attempt for  fundamental change in a stealth manner. They in fact beat back the onslaught, but just barely. However, once  the American people were made aware  of the significance of what was going  on, they won the day.  Does it sound familiar? Yes, it sounds  tremendously familiar if you look at  what just happened with the immigration bill  in which the elites of this  country were trying to foist upon us a  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:44 Jul 11, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K10JY7.074 H10JYPT1 E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o l e o n c         ",2007

1906,58,2007-07-10,Mr. LUGAR.,"  Another  amendment  would  keep  some forces in Iraq, pull most forces  out by next April 1. Their numbers  would be dramatically reduced and the  mission dramatically redefined.  Some argue that American soldiers  should withdraw from Iraq’s cities and  instead focus on the training of Iraqi  forces, targeting counterterrorism, and  protecting  the  remaining American  troops there. Let me say that is a vision I would embrace for the future but  not as a substitute for the surge counteroffensive strategy we are following  now but as a consequence of a successful  implementation of that strategy,  for if we in this Chamber and in Congress mandate the withdrawal of our  troops down to a core group with a new  mission before the Iraqi security forces  are ready to provide security, we are  going back to the exact strategy some  describe  as  the Rumsfeld  strategy  which didn’t work, which was roundly  condemned by most people in both parties over a period of years.  I repeat my confidence that the number of American troops will be reduced,  but it will be reduced best when it is  reduced as a result of the successful  implementation of the surge strategy  as carried out heroically by American  forces.  I conclude with these words: Our responsibilities  in  this Chamber ultimately do not allow us to be guided by  our frustrations or even by public-opinion polls when we respectfully believe  those public-opinion polls do not reflect what is best for our Nation. We  were elected to lead. We were elected  to see beyond the next election, to do  what is best for the next generation of  Americans. We were elected to defend  our beloved country, its security, and  its values. All of that is on the line in  Iraq today.  So I appeal to my colleagues, let’s  not undercut our troops and legislate a  defeat in Iraq where none is occurring  now, where hope is strong, where the  momentum is, in fact, on our side. If  you question that, at least show the  fairness  and  respect  for  General  Petraeus, Ambassador Crocker, and all  the people working for us there to wait  until September, which is what we said  we would do, until we take a serious  look at these amendments. If we go  down the path the amendments entice  us  toward, what  awaits  us  is  an  emboldened  Iran, a strengthened al-  Qaida, a failed Iraq that will become  not just a killing field but will destabilize the entire Middle East and also,  I  fear,  imperil our security here at  home.

Before my  good  friend, Senator LIEBERMAN, departs the floor, I will make one observation about him that I think needs to  be said. This winning/losing is a big  part of wars; it is a big part of politics.  Everybody wants to win, and people  are afraid to lose. But I have found in  life there are some things that are  worth fighting for and willing to lose  your job over, and to me the policies in  Iraq fall into that category because it  is much more important in my election  that we get it right in Iraq, and from  Senator LIEBERMAN’s point of view—I  don’t think I have seen in modern politics anyone more committed to their  beliefs than Senator LIEBERMANwhen  it comes to a foreign policy issue like  Iraq. We all know the story of his last  election, how he basically lost a primary because he refused to give in to  the forces on the left when it came to  the war on terror policies, particularly  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:29 Jul 29, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\S10JY7.REC S10JY 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2007

1910,86,2007-07-10,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, first let  me  thank my dear  friend, Senator  SALAZAR, for his comments. They are  particularly meaningful coming  from  somebody who as much as anybody in  this body strives to bring Members together in common causes. I want to  tell him how grateful I am for his comments  but  also,  even more  importantly, how grateful we all are for the  effort he makes to cross the aisle and  bring Senators together on important  issues of the day.  Last night,  I was not able to be  present when our bill came to the floor.  I was chairing a subcommittee meeting  which I could not leave. I asked a number of colleagues on the Armed Services Committee if they could fill in for  me, and very graciously and, as always,  very competently, Senators BENNELSONand BILLNELSONfulfilled that role  and responded to that request, and I  am very grateful to them for having  done so. I wasn’t able then to present  the bill, as a bill of this magnitude  should be presented, and I will take a  few minutes at this time to do that.  The Defense Authorization Act  for  fiscal year 2008 would fully fund the fiscal year 2008 budget request of $648.8  billion for national security activities  of the Department of Defense and the  Department of Energy.  The Senate Armed Services Committee has a long tradition of setting  aside  partisanship  and working  together in the interest of the national  defense. That tradition has been maintained this year. I am pleased that our  bill, S. 1547, was reported to the Senate  on a unanimous 25-to-nothing vote of  our committee. Additionally, S. 1606,  the Dignified Treatment of Wounded  Warriors Act, which we will be taking  up either as part of this bill or as a  freestanding measure, was  also  reported by the committee on a unanimous 25-to-nothing vote. These votes  stand as a testament to the common  commitment of all of our Members to  supporting our men and women in uniform.  Our bill contains many  important  provisions that will improve the quality of life of our men and women in  uniform, provide needed support and  assistance to our troops on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, make  the investments we need to meet the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:29 Jul 29, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\S10JY7.REC S10JY 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2007
1911,93,2007-07-10,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator from Arizona.  ,2007
1912,93,2007-07-10,Mr. MCCAIN.," I paid attention to the  statement of the Senator from Illinois,  as well as that of the Senator from Nevada. We may be approaching—not a  historic moment in the history of the  Senate but certainly one worthy of  note; that is, according to my staff,  that is not always accurate but is well  meaning, we are about, maybe, at least  26 years since we have not had a Defense authorization bill passed by this  body. Clearly from this beginning it appears, as on most other  issues that  have come before this body recently,  we will be gridlocked.  Cloture motions will be filed. Votes  will be taken. Time passes and, unfortunately, during that period of time,  the men and women who are serving in  our military will be without their pay  increase. They will be without the increase in numbers that are called for in  this bill, from 512,000 in the Army to  525,000; from 180,000 in the Marines to  189,000.  The best way, probably, to relieve  the stress on the men and women in  the military and the overdeployment  that, unfortunately, we all regret they  have had to bear, their unfair share of  sacrifice in defense of this Nation and  its security, is to increase the size of  the military. That is in this bill.  Frankly, the reason we arrived at  these numbers is it is just about as  many as can be recruited additionally;  otherwise, I think you would see additional numbers.  Instead of  the  3.5-percent pay  increase, instead of increasing size in the  Army and Marine Corps, which we all  know is badly needed, some of us, including my friend from Michigan, have  known for many years how badly it was  needed. One of  the many mistakes  made by the previous Secretary of Defense was not to call for a dramatic increase in the size of our Marine Corps  and Army, for which our military families have paid a very heavy price.  Here we are, gridlocked in a battle  whether we are going to have 60 votes  and whether we are going to have to  file a cloture motion which will ripen  after a couple of days and all the arcane things that very few Americans  understand. It took me a number of  years to finally comprehend some of  the procedures around here.  So we are, again, going to probably  maintain that historic low in approval  that was recently, in a recent Gallop  Poll that has been taken  for many  years—I have  forgotten  the number  now. I think it was in the teens as the  approval rating of the Congress on the  part of the American people.  Anybody who just watched the proceedings  that went on and  the exchanges between the two leaders make  that disapproval rating far more understandable. The average citizen watching these debates really doesn’t understand why we don’t just go ahead and  take care of the men and women in the  military, to give them the arms and  ammunition they need, to give them  the much needed equipment we have  talked about on this list—the $2.7 billion items on the Army Chief of Staff’s  unfunded requirements list, things like  the $4.1 billion for the MRAP, the Mine  Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles.  We all know how bad the situation is,  as far as IEDs are concerned.  What are we going to do? Are we  going to sit down and say: Hey, you  know what. When the Democrats were  in the minority around here they insisted on 60 votes on just about every  issue, particularly important ones. We  are now insisting on 60 votes, now that  we are in the minority. Yet somewhere  along the way the issue of c-o-m-i-t-y  and the national interest suffers and is  abandoned by the wayside of politics.  The Senator from Michigan and I will  sit here this afternoon and we will have  statements made by various Members  as they come to the floor. There are, if  my past experience with this bill is accurate,  probably  100, maybe more,  amendments that will be pending because there are so many issues that are  important to Members and important  to the defense of this Nation. It is very  likely, from this scenario I am seeing,  that we will for the first time in at  least 26 years not pass a Defense authorization  bill—certainly not  in  a  timely manner. We are already into the  month of July, and, obviously, we will  not spend all 4 weeks on this issue.  I think in days gone by—and we all  have a tendency to remember the good  parts and not the bad parts—there was  a tendency for the managers of the bill  and the majority and whatever party  was in the minority leaders would sit  down and say: OK, we are going to narrow down  the amendments. We are  going to have agreement for a certain  number of amendments and votes, and  it would take us a while. I can remember sometimes it taking 2 weeks. That  is why we usually bump it up against a  recess because one thing in the 20 years  I have been here we have never missed  is a recess. Now we are going to sit  here for this afternoon. It is Tuesday  afternoon, and we are going to have  various statements. Members on both  sides will display their dedication to  the men and women in the military. I  appreciate that. I appreciate the patriotism of every single Member of this  body. But are we really going to do  anything for them? Are we really going  to try to help them? Or are we going to  be locked in combat on an issue that  should not be on this bill?  We probably have taken up the issue  of the war in Iraq eight or nine times.  I don’t know exactly how many times.  We have amendments, we have debates,  we have 60 votes, and then we move on  to something else. Meanwhile, we have  not done a single appropriations bill, I  might add, and we are in the month of  July.  Everybody knows,  even  though  I  don’t happen to agree with it, that September will be a seminal time on the  Iraq issue.  General Petraeus will  be  coming  back, and he will be issuing his report,  which, by the way, I can predict what  it is going to be right now; mixed, some  success and  some  frustration. Then,  guess what, in September, we are going  to go through another debate. We are  going to have amendments, and we are  going to have 60 votes again.  Meanwhile, the American people are  wondering what in the heck we are all  about here, and why in the world, in all  due  respect  to  the deputy majority  leader, do we have to keep taking up  the Iraq issue when we know full well  that  in September  there will be a  major debate on this issue?  Meanwhile, the men and women in  the military who are serving, to whom  I see declaration after declaration of  our dedication and devotion to their  welfare and benefit, then what is going  to equip them? What is going to train  them? What is going to give them the  pay raise? What is going to take care of  them is somehow lost in the rhetoric of  60-vote  requirements,  which  again,  most Americans do not understand nor  should they be required to, because  they expect us to come here and act in  their benefit. Certainly they should be  asking us to act on an issue, on a piece  of legislation such as the Defense authorization bill which has to do with  the defense of this Nation.  Well, I could go on for a long time.  I do not want in any way my comments to be construed as a lack of respect and appreciation for the chairman of the committee, and the many  years we have worked together, because I am convinced he and I could sit  down in a very short period of time and  work out the number of amendments  and  schedule votes and  time agreements. But we are not going to do that.  We are not going to do that. But please  do not come to the floor, I ask my colleagues, and talk about your dedication to the men and women in the military and how difficult it is for them in  these times, when we have before us a  bill to increase the size of the military,  we have before us a bill to give them a  pay increase that they deserve, and it  probably is not going to be passed by  this body, at least before we go out for  the August recess. Then we get into  September. Then we will get into another fight on the issue of whether we  should withdraw troops in Iraq.  I don’t think we should be very proud  of ourselves. I don’t. When the men and  women in the military whom we again,  as I say, all profess our devotion and  dedication to, do not get the equipment  they need authorized, do not get the increases in pay, do not get the increases  in numbers that we are trying to authorize, then do not be too surprised  with the cynicism of the American people and voters and, indeed, the men and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:29 Jul 29, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\S10JY7.REC S10JY 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2007
1913,121,2007-07-10,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  introduce  the Community  Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, the CLASS Act. This important piece of legislation builds on the  promise and possibilities of the Americans with Disabilities Act by helping  the large numbers of Americans who  struggle every day to live productive  lives in their communities.  Too many Americans are perfectly  capable of living a life in the community, but are denied the supports they  need.  They  languish  in  needless  circumstances with no choice about how  or where to obtain these services.  Too often, they have to give up the  American Dream, the dignity of a job,  a home, and a family, so they can qualify for Medicaid, the only program that  will support them.  The bill we propose is a long overdue  effort to offer greater dignity, greater  hope, and greater opportunity.  It makes a  simple pact with all  Americans—‘‘If you work hard and contribute, society will take care of you  when you fall on hard times.’’  The concept is clear, everyone can  contribute and everyone can win. We  all benefit when no one is left behind.  For only $30 a month, a person who  pays into the program will receive either $50 or $100 a day, based on their  ability to carry out basic daily activities.  They themselves will decide how this  assistance will be spent, on transportation so they can stay employed, or  on a ramp to make their home more  accessible, or to cover the cost of a personal care attendant or a family caregiver.  It will help keep families together,  instead of being torn apart by obstacles  that discourage them from staying at  home.  The bill will strengthen job opportunities for people with disabilities at a  time when 70 percent are unemployed.  They have so much to contribute and  the bill will help them do it.  It will  save on  the mushrooming  health care costs for Medicaid, the Nation’s primary  insurer of  long-term  care services, which also forces beneficiaries to give up their jobs and live  in poverty before they become eligible  for assistance.  The CLASS Act is a hopeful new approach to restoring independence and  choice for millions of these persons and  enabling them to take greater control  of their lives.  It is time to respect the rights and  dignity of all Americans, and I look  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:29 Jul 29, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00066 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 J:\CRONLINE€7BA~3€7NE~2\S10JY7.REC S10JY 7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o k c i r e d e r f r         ",2007

1915,142,2007-07-10,Mr. TOWNS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to honor the life and work of Dr. Elias Blake,  Jr.,  former president of Clark College  in Atlanta, GA. Dr. Blake was an impassioned advocate for education, social justice and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. His  passing is a profound loss to the struggle for  higher education in the African-American community.  Dr. Blake led Clark College from 1977 until  1987. During that decade, he developed and  implemented a plan  that resulted  in placing  the college on a sound financial path, major  improvements  in  faculty  training  and  curriculum, securing national accreditations  for  many academic programs, seeking out and retaining  the best and brightest minds  to enhance their academic and life skills, and enhancing  science, mathematics and musical  scholarships while making jazz music a signature experience at Clark College.  Madam Speaker, I cannot in this short time  do justice to the life and achievements of Dr.  Elias Blake, Jr.; however, it is fitting that as his  final accomplishment he was working on a  study of Brown v. Board of Education,  the  landmark decision of  the United States Supreme Court  that overturned segregation  in  our Nation’s public schools.  A lifelong advocate for jazz music, Dr. Blake  worked with such notables as Dizzy Gillespie,  Max Roach, Billy Taylor, and many others to  encourage younger musicians in their musical  pursuits. My heart goes out to the family of  Elias Blake, Jr. and I want them to know that  I appreciate the life and work of Dr. Blake and  that he will be greatly missed.  Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize  Dr. Elias Blake, Jr. for his continuing dedication to the world’s children as well as those  children in our community.  Madam Speaker,  I urge my colleagues  to  join me in paying tribute to Dr. Elias Blake, Jr.,  former president of Clark College.  REGARDING THE SCORE  ASSOCIATION  HON.

1916,142,2007-07-10,Mr. VAN HOLLEN.," Madam Speaker, America’s small businesses are among  the most  vital elements of the Nation’s economy. Small  businesses employ 50 percent of the Nation’s  workforce, produce 97 percent of all exports  and generate the majority of innovations that  come from U.S. companies.  Many times, an entrepreneur’s dreams become a nightmare because they lack the necessary training to plan and evaluate a business proposal or they lack the proper funding  or skills to be successful. That is why Madam  Speaker  I rise  today  to recognize  the work  and committed public service of employees  and volunteers of SCORE.  SCORE is a vital source of free and confidential  advice  for  existing  and  emerging  small businesses and has become a trusted  and valued partner of the U.S. Small Business  Administration. SCORE has 389 chapters nationwide staffed with 10,500 volunteers comprised of working and retired small business  owners, successful corporate executives and  military veterans and professionals. These experienced  business  counselors  share  their  knowledge and experience with entrepreneurs  in the strictest confidence and without conflicts  of interest.  In the past year, SCORE conducted more  than 300,000 counseling sessions and held  nearly  7,000  workshops  with more  than  125,000 attendees. SCORE volunteers have  devoted more than one million hours to helping America’s small business owners and entrepreneurs.  SCORE volunteers deserve  to be  recognized  for  their commitment  to public service  and  for  their efforts  to build strong communities and strong small businesses.  f  CONGRATULATING SACRED HEART  CATHOLIC CHURCH OF WACO ON  THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY  HON.

1917,142,2007-07-10,Mr. EDWARDS.," Madam Speaker, on June  24, 2007 the parishioners and community of  Waco celebrated the 50th anniversary of the  Sacred Heart Catholic Church, a cornerstone  of our Central Texas community.  Like many Spanish Franciscan churches in  this great nation, Sacred Heart Parish had a  very humble beginning. In 1946, the priests of  St. Francis Church established three catechetical centers: Hernandez at 2306 Bagby Avenue, Gonzalez at 2224 James Street, and  Rosas at 2313 Bagby Avenue. On June 30,  1957, in what became known as a very moving ceremony,  the Most Reverend Louis J.  Reicher, Bishop of Austin dedicated the Sacred Heart Catholic Church.  Several outstanding and dedicated priests  have demonstrated their devotion and commitment  to  the growth and development of  the  Sacred Heart Catholic Church over the past  50 years, including Father Francisco Dols, Father Miguel Rigo, Reverend Anthony Ferrer,  Father Gonzalo Ferrer, and presently Father  Lawrence Soler.  Under  the  leadership of Father Lawrence  Soler, the Sacred Heart Church has impacted  the lives of many people. Father Soler, recognized for over 50 years in the priesthood, has  a history of unselfish devotion to others, a legacy of personal achievement, as well as, an  unwavering commitment to his faith.  The profound words of Father Lawrence,  spoken during the 25th anniversary of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, best describe the  impressive past, as well as the bright future of  the Sacred Heart Catholic Church:  ‘‘From a  few scattered  families  it has grown  into a  closely knit community of faith, pooling its talents, coordinating its efforts for more effectiveness, so that God may be glorified and mankind served. Our greatest strength in the future will be, as it was in the past, our Faith,  our Hope, and our Love.’’  With this compelling mission of faith and the  spiritual message of serving others  to guide  them,  the people of Sacred Heart Catholic  Church of Waco have touched countless lives.  On this 50th anniversary, I rise to honor the  moral  leadership, dedication  to  community,  and generous spirit of Sacred Heart Catholic  Church, and extend my warmest wishes  for  continued blessings in the years ahead.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF STAFF SERGEANT MATTHEW P. PATNAUDE  HON. JAMES T. WALSH  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 10, 2007  Mr. WALSH of New York. Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  in honor of SSgt Matthew P.  Patnaude, 314th Civil Engineering Squadron,  United States Air Force. SSgt Patnaude, an  Explosive Ordnance Disposal, EOD, Technician, has been recognized by  the Air Force  Times as the 2007 Airman of the Year.  As an EOD Technician, SSgt Patnaude was  deployed to Kirkuk, Iraq, to help protect our  armed  forces  from various  forms of enemy  ordnance. During  his  time  in  Iraq  SSgt  Patnaude safeguarded over 16,000 coalition  troops by executing 105 high-risk missions,  neutralizing 45  IEDs, uncovering 9 weapons  caches, and disposing of 40,000 pieces of  enemy armaments. This exemplary service  record alone  is reason enough  to recognize  SSgt Patnaude, but his  impressive  resume  stretches  far beyond  these black and white  numbers.  While on a mission to neutralize a roadside  bomb in Iraq, SSgt Patnaude was attacked by  an enemy sniper. Although seriously  injured  by the sniper’s bullet, he vectored his security  team to the sniper’s location, as well as kept  the medic treating his wounds advised of the  enemy’s activities. The SSgt also exemplified  courage under  fire when wounded by an  enemy lED during yet another high-risk mission. Always  putting  his  team  first, SSgt  Patnaude checked on his chief, radioed security, and set up  the area  for medical personnel. As SSgt Patnaude’s supervisor has  previously stated: ‘‘his actions under fire are,  simply put, heroic.’’  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:42 Jul 11, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A10JY8.011 E10JYPT1 S K R A M E R M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

1919,1,2007-07-23,Mr. BLUMENAUER.," Mr. Speaker,  the front page of the Washington Post  yesterday had the harsh and ugly reality. We cannot afford not to help the  Iraqis who trusted and worked with the  United States with the opportunity for  refugee status.  I quote:  ‘‘The American Ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan Crocker, has asked the Bush  administration  to  take  the unusual  step of granting immigrant visas to all  Iraqis employed by the United States  Government in Iraq because of growing  concern that they will quit and flee the  country if they cannot be assured of  eventual safe passage to the United  States.’’  For the last 7 months, I have been  working with a broad bipartisan group  of people on legislation that would deal  with the largest ongoing humanitarian  crisis in the world other than Darfur.  And unlike the tragedy in the Darfur  region of the Sudan, the United States  is front and center in Iraq. We have  over 300,000 American soldiers, contractors, and civilian U.S. Government employees. We see firsthand every day the  train wreck, while officials at the top  of the food chain appear, sadly, oblivious and powerless  to do anything  about it.  I am proud to say that there are  young American soldiers who will try  to do something about it, even after  they rotate out of the country. That is  how I  first became  involved  in this  issue, as young Oregonian Guard members fought valiantly to try to save the  life of their interpreter when they returned to Oregon, knowing that her life  was at risk. Working with those young  guardsmen and with high school students  from Lincoln High School  in  Portland, Oregon, we were able to have  a happy resolution in this one case.  But, sadly, it is only one case.  I have become acquainted with another true American hero. Kirk Johnson was a young USAID worker who, as  he rotated out, embarked upon a crusade to save the lives of Iraqis who  were at risk because they were known  to have helped the United States. He  has compiled a list of over 500 Iraqis  who  were  interpreters,  who  were  guides, who were civilian employees.  Not one, the last time I talked to Mr.  Johnson, had been able to make it to  the United States.  The sad fact is that we are failing  miserably in terms of responding to the  refugee requirements. Since I became  involved  last  fall, the United States  has admitted the grand total of 133  Iraqi  refugees,  a  shocking  number  when we consider that over 2 million  Iraqis have fled the country and another 2 million within Iraq have been  displaced  from their homes. It’s not  that we can’t figure out how to do it if  we care, if we establish a priority, if we  work on it. In that same period of time  that we could only admit 133 Iraqis, we  have allowed 3,500 refugees from Iran, a  country with whom we have rocky relations, to say the least, where we have  deep concerns about terrorism.  It makes a mockery of our commitment to accept 7,000 during this fiscal  year which ends September 30. There  must be a sense of urgency and a profound sense of obligation. In order to  make even that modest goal of 7,000,  we are going to have to admit more  Iraqi refugees every working day than  we have for the entire last 9 months.  It is not just the right thing to do for  these poor souls and their  families.  There is a harsh geopolitical reality.  With 4 million Iraqis displaced, more  than half fleeing the country, there’s  1.2 million in Syria, and the accounts  of what these people are forced to do to  keep body and soul together are truly  disturbing. Or three-quarters of a million Iraqi refugees across the border in  Jordan, threatening to overwhelm that  small country, adding another element  of instability to this already unsettled  part of the world.  I urge my colleagues in the House of  Representatives to look at a letter that  we are circulating to them today that  includes this article from the Post. I  urge them to cosponsor our bipartisan  legislation, H.R. 2265, have them urge a  markup and action before we recess for  August. Our failure to keep our commitment will be exceedingly serious.  We undermine our ability to carry out  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

1923,8,2007-07-23,Mr. GRIJALVA.," Mr. Speaker, this  legislation, which  I  introduced  on  March 13 of this year, authorizes the  Secretary of the Interior to participate  in the Avra/Black Wash Reclamation  and Riparian Restoration Project.  The extremely arid climate of Tucson, Arizona, and that metropolitan  area requires careful and  innovative  planning of both water  supply and  wastewater treatment systems.  The proposed Avra Valley Reclamation  and Riparian Restoration Site  would spread treated wastewater on  mesquite  riparian  forest  in  Black  Wash, creating valuable riparian habitats  for migrating  birds, while  recharging groundwater for the greater  Tucson area.  I want to thank the chairwoman of  the subcommittee on Water and Power,  Mrs. NAPOLITANO, and the chairman of  the Committee on Natural Resources,  Mr. RAHALL, for their assistance in advancing this legislation.  I urge my colleagues to support the  passage of H.R. 1503, as amended.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

Mr. Speaker, the Underground Railroad was a historic protest movement  against slavery which helped escaped  slaves find freedom in Northern States  and Canada prior to the Civil War.  The National Underground Railroad  Network to Freedom Act of 1998 established  the Underground Network  to  Freedom Program administered by the  National Park Service. Today the program carries out important activities  in more than 27 States and the District  of Columbia.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my  friend and colleague  from  Florida (Mr. HASTINGS) for his work on  this  legislation. He has been a real  leader in this bipartisan effort to enhance the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Program.

I introduced this legislation with my good friend, the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. CASTLE).  The widespread bipartisan  support  this legislation has received with 67 cosponsors and endorsement by the National Parks Conservation Association  has demonstrated that black history is  synonymous with American history as  life experience shared by all citizens of  America.  I would like to thank Chairman RAHALLand Mr. DONYOUNGof the Natural Resources Committee for bringing  this important legislation to the floor,  and I would especially like to thank  the  gentleman  from  Arizona  (Mr.  the  subcommittee  chairman, and his counterpart, Representative ROBBISHOP, for their support. And  my congratulations to Mrs. MCMORRIS  RODGERSon her recent addition to her  family and her finding time to come  and support this legislation as well.  With passage of this  legislation, I  hope that the National Park Service  will give  the National Underground  Railroad Network to Freedom its due  priority with  adequate  staffing  to  maintain the growing network. Toward  that end, I would also like to thank the  staff of the respective committees who  helped to expedite this matter.  Mr. Speaker, when I joined my esteemed former colleague, as did many  other Members,  and  the  person  to  whom I am referring is Representative  Lou Stokes, in 1998, he led the effort to  establish  the National Underground  Railroad to Freedom. I don’t think any  of us could have  foreseen the emergence of the National Park Service as  one of the largest stewards of black  history in the United States. Nor could  we have predicted the rapidly expanding support and interest for one of the  most intriguing multicultural collaborations in the history of our Nation.  The Network to Freedom is a key  feature that diversifies engagement in  interpretive opportunities of our National Park System. It has grown to 300  programs,  sites, and partners  in  28  States and the District of Columbia.  This network is a national treasure of  historic buildings,  routes, programs,  projects, and museums with thematic  connections to the Underground Railroad.  The legislation before us today appropriately adjusts the authorization  levels for the Network to Freedom to  reflect the growth of interest nationally, and the resulting expansion of opportunities. These  adjustments will  help to resolve the financial challenges  facing the Network to Freedom that  include the lack of consistent development grants and administrative support for affiliates.

1939,22,2007-07-23,Mr. ROYCE.," Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Subcommittee Chairman SHERMAN for his  work on  this  legislation. He worked  this bill  thoroughly, and while we disagree on OPIC’s  merits, he supported my text to reform its investment funds.  OPIC’s investment funds, as some may remember,  have  a  troubled  history.  In  the  1990s, then-OPIC president Ruth Harkin said,  ‘‘If you’re an  investor  in an OPIC-supported  fund, the worst you can do is get your money  back at the need of 10 years.’’ That’s not the  free market OPIC professes  to support and  not surprisingly, these funds were subject to  political cronyism.  There have been reforms  to  the  funds of  late,  including  competitively  selecting  fund  managers, but we should mandate them. My  language does this.  Fundamentally  though,  I  remain  unconvinced  that OPIC  is doing something worthwhile that the private sector wouldn’t do. The  burden of proof should be on OPIC, especially  in  times of accelerating change  in  financial  markets. Several companies have jumped into  the political risk insurance business, for example, offering  increasingly sophisticated products, . . . so why are we reauthorizing government-backed OPIC to continue competing  against them?  We have heard much on  the  floor  trumpeting OPIC’s supposed benefits. However,  most economists believe  that subsidizing  investment—which is what OPIC does—merely  shifts it around, often to lesser productive locations and uses. The Congressional Research Service has reported, ‘‘From the point  of view of the U.S. economy as a whole, there  is  little  theoretical support or empirical evidence  that supports claims  that subsidizing  exports or overseas investment offers a positive net gain  in  jobs  to  the U.S. economy.’’  That’s persuasive evidence against OPIC’s  claims, and its case for reauthorization.  OPIC makes much of the fact that it returns  money to the U.S. Treasury. OK. But let’s consider that this money is held against potential  liabilities stemming from OPIC’s activities. And  give most anybody U.S. government-backing  to trade on, and they’d turn a profit in financial  markets.  One OPIC critic gave a useful description.  Investment  is  like a  rope. Less developed  countries can only pull it in with good policies;  efforts to push in investment, which is OPIC’s  mandate, are bound to be inefficient.  Mr. Speaker, these are some of the reasons  I oppose this legislation reauthorizing OPIC.  ",2007
1940,22,2007-07-23,Mr. DINGELL.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 2798,  the  ‘‘Overseas Private  Investment  Corporation  Reauthorization  Act  of  2007’’. Since its establishment in 1971, OPIC  has offered investment financing and political  risk  insurance  to American businesses and  lenders, which are willing to direct private capital to developing countries.  While OPIC has proven  to be a valuable  tool for U.S. foreign and commercial policy, it  is in need of some improvement. I am pleased  that H.R. 2798 establishes requirements that  projects be approved only in countries that are  making progress toward adopting international  labor and environmental standards. H.R. 2798  also embraces  the necessity of promoting  peace and stability in the international system  by  prohibiting OPIC  from  participating  in  projects in countries that are sponsors of terrorism, possess or have programs to develop  nuclear weapons, or commit genocide.  I would object, however, to one provision in  this bill. H.R. 2798 requires OPIC  to  implement a climate change mitigation action plan,  which would  include  increased support  for  projects  that use and develop clean energy  technologies. The bill  further stipulates  that  OPIC submit a report on this plan, as well as  annual environmental impact assessments of  the projects  that  it supports,  to  the House  Committee on Foreign Affairs and Senate  Committee on Foreign Relations. I respectfully  suggest that these reports also be submitted  to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, not only because of  the committee’s  jurisdiction and expertise in policy matters related  to energy and  foreign commerce, but  also because  this would augment Congressional oversight of OPIC  in order  to ensure  that its plans for environmentally responsible  development  receive  careful  and  thorough  consideration. It is my sincere hope that the  Committee on Foreign Affairs will work with  the Committee on Energy and Commerce to  address this concern when H.R. 2798 is considered again during conference.  I would urge that the House approve H.R.  2798 and thank my colleagues on the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their work on this  bill.  ",2007

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of House Resolution  384,  congratulating  the University of Wyoming’s  women’s basketball team for winning  the 2007 NCAA Division I Woman’s National Invitational Tournament Championship.  On March 31, 2007, the University of  Wyoming Cowgirls basketball team defeated the University of Wisconsin by a  score of 72–56 to capture the NIT title  and conclude their most successful season in school history.  Led by  junior Hanna Zaveckz, the  tournament MVP,  and  junior  Jodi  Bolerjack, who scored 16 points in the  championship game, the Cowgirls of  Wyoming truly had a remarkable season in which they compiled a record of  27–9, finishing second in the Mountain  West Conference.  The tournament title capped what  ended up being the most successful season ever for the Cowgirls basketball  team in school history. No Wyoming  Cowgirls team had won as many games.  The previous record was set by the  1978–79 team, which  finished at 25–7,  and no team ever advanced so far in  postseason play.  As the State’s sole 4-year educational  institution, the University of Wyoming  receives strong support from the State  and its residents, making it the perfect  place for a great learning environment.  The university was recently ranked by  the Princeton Review as one of the Nation’s best colleges for 2006, and the  College of Business Department of Economics and Finance was also ranked  10th  in the Nation and 12th  in the  world for its program in resource and  environmental economics.  I extend my congratulations to head  coach Joe Legerski, athletic director  Tom  Berman,  president  Tom  Buchanan, all of the hard-working players, the fans and to the University of  Wyoming.  I’m happy to join my good friend and  colleague Representative CUBINin honoring this exceptional team and all the  accomplishments,  and wish  all  involved continued success.

Res.  561) recognizing the 20th anniversary of  the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and the impact it has made  on homelessness and endeavoring to  continue working to eliminate homelessness in the United States.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:  H. RES. 561  Whereas July 22, 2007, is the 20th anniversary of the enactment of the Stewart B.  McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, which  was renamed the McKinney-Vento Homeless  Assistance Act in October 2000;  Whereas  Representatives  Stewart  B.  McKinney and Bruce Vento worked tirelessly  in the Congress to develop a Federal response to homelessness;  Whereas Representative Stewart B. McKinney was committed to exposing the depth of  the growing problem of homelessness in the  1980s;  Whereas Representative Stewart B. McKinney was a recognized expert on Federal housing law and urban affairs who successfully  amended the National Housing Act and the  Housing and Community Development Act of  1974 to better target Federal aid to smaller  cities, but became terminally ill with pneumonia after sleeping on a grate outside a  Federal building with the homeless of Washington, DC;  Whereas in 1985, after personally viewing  the circumstances of the homeless and the  need for crisis intervention in his congressional district in St. Paul, Minnesota, Representative Bruce Vento introduced a resolution to express the sense of the Congress that  homelessness is a national problem requiring  a national solution;  Whereas throughout his career, Representative Vento remained dedicated to securing  a commitment of Federal resources to address homelessness;  Whereas the programs established by the  McKinney-Vento Act have provided housing,  education, health care, and job training assistance, and critical outreach, to thousands  of homeless men, women, and children in the  United States;  Whereas the Education for Homeless Children and Youth Program of the McKinney-  Vento Act has resulted in a significant increase in the number of homeless children  and youth attending school on a regular  basis;  Whereas the McKinney-Vento Act was intended to be only an emergency response and  not the sole Federal response to homelessness;  Whereas over the course of a year, as many  as 3,500,000 persons are estimated to experience homelessness in the United States;  Whereas approximately 400,000 veterans of  the Armed Forces of the United States experience homelessness at some point over the  course of a year;  Whereas the homeless population includes  vulnerable groups such as children, unaccompanied youth, and persons with disabilities; and  Whereas  there  were  at  least  142  unprovoked assaults against homeless persons in 2006, including 20 that resulted in  death: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) recognizes the 20th anniversary of the  McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act  and the impact it has made on homelessness  in the United States;  (2)  recognizes  the  positive  impact  the  McKinney-Vento Act has had on hundreds of  thousands of homeless men, women, children, and youth in the United States;  (3) recognizes the substantial contributions  of Representatives Stewart B. McKinney and  Bruce Vento in addressing homelessness;  (4) recognizes that homelessness continues  to be an urgent problem  in  the United  States;  (5) commends the dedication and commitment of service providers, including faith-  based and nonprofit organizations, who are  working to end homelessness in their communities and provide emergency food, shelter, and services to homeless Americans;  (6) recognizes that the lack of affordable  housing  exacerbates homelessness  in  the  United States;  (7) supports the continued efforts of Federal, State, and local governments and private non-profit organizations in their efforts  to prevent and end homelessness through the  development of affordable housing;  (8) recognizes that the life expectancy of a  homeless person in the United States is 30  years shorter than that of the average American and supports efforts to  improve the  health of homeless Americans;  (9) supports efforts to prevent and end  homelessness among veterans of the Armed  Forces of the United States;  (10) supports efforts to ensure accurate and  timely processing of applications  for disability benefits as a means of decreasing  homelessness among disabled persons;  (11) recognizes that the safety and well-  being of homeless persons is an urgent problem;  (12) recognizes the critical role of education and public schools in preventing and  ending homelessness, and supports efforts to  improve stability, services, and access to  school for homeless children and youth; and  (13) endeavors to work with the same courage, dignity, and determination exemplified  by Representatives McKinney and Vento to  eliminate homelessness in the United States.

1953,36,2007-07-23,Mr. GOHMERT.," Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate the opportunity to pay  tribute to David Ray Ritcheson, having  met him, talked with him, and heard  his testimony at the Judiciary Committee.  David Ray Ritcheson was  truly a  brave young man who had a horrible  act committed against him. His early  departure from this life made his story  all the more tragic. The crime committed against him earlier in his life is  one that should not be tolerated under  any  circumstances.  The  applicable  State law dealt with that crime in such  a way that I understand the main perpetrators received life and 90 years as  sentences.  On hearing  the  sad  testimony by  David at our hearing, everyone was  moved with a sense of outrage. Yet, on  closer examination of what the majority was trying to do, it caused me to  ask if there was anything in this hate  crimes bill that would have changed  anything about David’s terrible situation. After all, the hate crimes bill has  no sentence higher than life. It’s not a  capital situation.  b1430  The answer was, and is, that there is  nothing  in the bill that would have  really made any substantive difference  in David’s situation.  It is also tragic that any acquaintances of David who did not know the  details of the brutality against him before apparently came to know about it  through his courage and the national  attention focused on him and the display of courage at our hearing. That is  further testimony itself to his courage.  But the ridicule at home that followed  his testimony is also tragic. It is sad  that he chose to end that life of such  incredible potential.  David’s earlier display of courage and  the unfairness and outrage he faced deserve attention. He deserves a heartfelt  salute. His family has our thoughts and  prayers with them, especially in this  loss of such a beautiful soul with so  much potential.  But the bill being touted in this resolution does not bring us together. It divides us by saying that some people in  this country are more  important to  protect than others. It divides by saying, for example, that those tragically  killed at Virginia Tech are not as important to protect as a transvestite  with gender identity issues. The bill  further  seeks  to  squelch  religious  teaching about immorality.  I stand here on the floor today to salute David Ray Ritcheson, an incredible young man. I want with all my  heart to vote for a resolution to pay  him proper tribute as well. But, unfortunately, I cannot vote for a resolution  that, since it includes a pursuit and an  adulation of the hate crimes bill, I cannot see the use of this tragedy to vote  to give accolades to a bill that I think  harms America and divides us.  If there is a recorded vote, I will vote  ‘‘present’’ out of my incredible respect  for David Ritcheson. But my ‘‘present’’  vote will also avoid the hypocrisy of  my saying I support the hate crimes  bill when I believe it harms the country, it harms religious teaching, and it  would not undo what was done  to  David.  I look forward to any opportunity to  do anything to pay tribute to David  Ritcheson standing on its own.  ",2007
1954,36,2007-07-23,Mr. PENCE.," Mr. Speaker, I reserve  the balance of my time.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as this bill is intended  to do, let me dwell on the life of David  Ray Ritcheson and how much he has  contributed  to moving  this country  forward. I would like to read just a portion of his statement  from his own  words  in  the  Judiciary Committee  speaking about the experience of his  tragedy:  ‘‘After burning me in the center of  the  forehead,  the  skinhead attacker  was heard saying that now I looked  like an Indian with a red dot on my  forehead. Moreover, the witnesses to  the attack recall the two attackers  calling me a ‘wetback’ and a ‘spic’ as  they continued to beat me as I lay unconscious. Once the attack came to an  end, I was dragged to the rear of the  backyard and left for dead.’’  The bill that David was so articulate  in helping us move forward provides resources for our smaller communities in  order  to ensure  that  if Federal  resources are needed, that nexus, that  connection, that assistance would be  provided. Therefore, it is clear that David’s  testimony  helped  assist  rural  communities.  I cite, for example, another tragic incident that occurred in a rural area,  and maybe the county  in that area  might not have been able to move forward. This bill, however, is already out  of the House. So our tribute today really focuses on the courage which David  provided to move that bill forward.  In Wyoming, Matthew Shepard was  in a rural area. It was a rural area in  Jasper, Texas, with Mr. James Byrd.  So we know that the bill that has  passed the House truly would provide  assistance to those communities that  would ask for it if such a tragedy occurred in their community. Again, Mr.  Speaker, simply if they asked for it.  I want  to emphasize  that  this  is  about David, so let me share with you  his words. These are the words that he  offered to the Judiciary Committee:  ‘‘It has been a blessing to know that  the most terrible day of my life may  help put another human face on the  campaign to enact a much needed law  such as H.R. 1592. I can assure you from  this day forward I will do whatever I  can to help America become our great  country, the United States of America  a hate-free place to live.’’ These are  David’s words.  As we move forward in trying to capture what his life was truly about, this  young,  friendly, cheerful  student at  Klein Collins High School in the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, popular  and a talented  football athlete, who  was loved and admired by his family  and friends, we want to ensure that, as  we go forward, if such a dastardly act  would happen again, we focus on the  family.  Mr. Speaker, we would like to see  health  care  support,  including  supportive counseling and therapy to prevent  future  severe  depression;  construction and personnel costs for shelters and hate crime support centers; direct service providers who are trained  to try and help those who have been  victims of hate crimes; health care insurance  for counseling and  therapy;  hotline services, so for those who witness hate crimes or other acts, we  would be able to provide an immediate  source of information for them to report what happened; short- and long-  term individual counseling and support  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:43 Aug 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD07\H23JY7.REC H23JY7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2007

1960,50,2007-07-23,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to honor a remarkable First Lady  and great conservationist, Lady Bird  Johnson. And it is with much sadness  that the House continues to note her  recent passing.  Born in 1912 in Karnack, Texas, in an  era when women were not expected to  accomplish great things, Mrs. Johnson  came to represent strength of character that was the hallmark of her life.  After graduating from the University  of Texas in 1933, she married Lyndon  Baines Johnson. Mrs. Johnson became  the mother of two daughters, certainly  her most important work, Lynda Bird  and Luci Baines Johnson. She spent  the next few decades raising her children and supporting her husband in his  political career, which, of course, led  him to the Presidency. She was a trusting sounding board  for her husband  through all his years in the House and  Senate and in the White House.  Mrs. Johnson led a nationwide effort  to call attention to the beauty and the  goal of highlighting historical sites and  highways by planting flowering plants  and wildflowers. While First Lady, she  visited numerous public sites and scenic areas, thus bringing local and national attention to her beautification  and conservation initiatives.  As we all have seen each spring in  Washington, Mrs. Johnson has left a  lasting legacy for all American and foreign visitors to this great city, who can  now see incredible numbers of flowers  throughout  the area. She not only  helped beautify Washington, but was  also responsible for the 1965 Highway  Beautification Act, calling for control  of outdoor advertising, as well as the  clean-up of  junkyards along the national highways.  It  is partly because of her efforts  that we now have the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, requiring at least  one-quarter of 1 percent of funds expended for landscaping projects in the  highway system to be used to plant native flowers, plants and trees.  After leaving Washington, Mrs. Johnson enthusiastically continued her conservation efforts throughout her beloved home State of Texas right up  until the date of her death on July 11,  2007.  I urge my colleagues to please join  me in honoring this great woman of  Texas and First Lady of the United  States, Lady Bird Johnson,  for her  untiring efforts in educating a Nation  on the benefits of conservation and  beautification throughout her lifetime.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
1961,50,2007-07-23,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Mr. Speaker, I  am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  author and sponsor of this resolution,  the  gentlewoman  from Texas, Representative EDDIEBERNICEJOHNSON.  ",2007
1962,50,2007-07-23,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of  Texas.," Mr. Speaker, let me thank these  two distinguished gentlemen on  the  floor, Mr. DAVIS of Illinois and Mr.  of Tennessee, for helping us  with this today.  I rise today to honor the life and accomplishments of Lady Bird Johnson. I  would like to thank my colleagues Mr.  HALL, Mr. BARTON and Mr. ORTIZ for  their sponsorship, and the entire Texas  delegation for joining me in sponsoring  and honoring Mrs. Johnson.  Mrs. Johnson was known as a woman  of class and integrity. She was strong  in spirit and always represented herself  with dignity and grace.  For  decades  Lady  Bird  Johnson  served with honor and dedication as  the wife of President Lyndon Baines  Johnson, throughout his service as a  staffer to Representative Kleberg, as he  served in the U.S. House of Representatives, as a U.S. Senator, as Vice President, and as President of the United  States. She served as President Johnson’s personal adviser throughout his  career and was known for expanding  the position of the First Lady by taking a visible role in President Johnson’s administration.  Lady Bird Johnson dedicated much of  her life to the preservation of our environment. Perhaps she could be considered the first environmentalist in this  era. This passion led her to create the  Capital Beautification Project to improve  physical  conditions  in Washington, DC, both for residents and tourists. Her efforts inspired similar programs  throughout  the country. She  also played a major role in the passage  of the 1965 Highway Beautification Act.  DUNCAN This was the first legislative campaign  begun by a First Lady. The trees and  flowers we  see along our American  highways today are a testament to her  work and her dedication.  After leaving Washington, President  and Mrs. Johnson moved back to Austin, Texas, where Mrs. Johnson continued to work for environmental causes.  And that is, perhaps, the most environmentally sensitive city in Texas right  now. Today we can all admire her legacy through the Lady Bird Johnson  Wildflower Center in Austin, Texas.  Mrs. Johnson died on July 11, 2007, at  the age of 94 at her home in Austin,  and was survived by her two daughters,  seven  grandchildren,  and  10  great-  grandchildren.  I would like to extend my deepest  condolences to the Johnson family. I  urge my colleagues to support this resolution to honor Lady Bird Johnson’s  incredible life and legacy.  ",2007

While she is no longer with us, the  masterpiece of her vision can be seen  along  the highways and byways of  America. Lady Bird’s wildflowers symbolize her life, a quiet, enduring beauty  that will enrich our lives for generations to come. With our highways as  her canvas, she painted with a brush of  God’s hand a  landscape  that brings  peace to us in our day-to-day lives.  The beauty of Lady Bird Johnson’s  vision did not stop with the highways  and parks of our Nation, for she also  envisioned a world not blighted by the  ugliness of poverty and discrimination.  As a partner  to  the President who  fought for a great society, she helped  make ours a better society. For that  we are all her beneficiaries.

The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:  H. RES. 558  Resolved, That at any time after the adoption of this resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the  House resolved into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for  consideration of the bill (H.R. 3074) making  appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes.

1976,57,2007-07-23,Mr. WELCH  of Vermont.," Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Madam Speaker, today, the House  will take up the ninth of 12 appropriation measures where we will continue  the effort to take America in a new direction, where we focus on priorities of  concern to average Americans throughout this country.  Through these bills, the new Congress is restoring our focus on a domestic agenda that helps all Americans,  not just the wealthy few and not just  the well-connected corporations.  We will make sure, as we have, that  our veterans have the care they need.  We’ll reverse neglect in environmental  protection that’s been abandoned, been  neglected for the past several years,  and we’ll fund housing programs for  low- and moderate-income Americans.  We will provide resources to ensure  that children arrive at school ready to  learn and have the health care that  they need, and we will make certain  that our law enforcement officials have  the tools that they need to protect our  citizens.  Madam Speaker, House Resolution  558 provides for consideration of H.R.  3074, the Transportation and Housing  and Urban Development Appropriations Act for 2008. This will be done  under an open rule. This is a bipartisan  bill  that was  presented  before  the  Rules Committee by Chairman OLVER  and Ranking Member KNOLLENBERG. It  was a pleasure, frankly, to see the cooperation of these two gentlemen and  the members of that committee coming together to present to the House  for its consideration a very impressive  plan to meet our  infrastructure and  housing needs in the future.  As you know, demographic changes  and growth patterns  in  the United  States over the next decade will continue to have a major impact on transportation networks and the need for affordable housing. This bill seeks to ensure that our Nation’s transportation  system is safe and efficient and that  our citizens have access to safe and affordable housing. The bill does so in a  way that strengthens the economy and  is environmentally and fiscally responsible.  The  bill  safeguards  the  regional  needs of our Nation by rejecting administration proposed cuts that provide air service to rural communities,  and it invests in transit projects for  our urban areas that will help our commuters save time and money getting to  work. The bill also rejects administration cuts to Amtrak, protects national  rail service, and fully funds the highway and transit guarantees set forth in  the SAFETEA-LU authorization bill.  The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee recognized the need to  support rural airports, something very  important to people like me from a  rural State like Vermont. Investments  in airports, like the Rutland State Airport in Vermont, are critical to rural  States and an effective transportation  system. The bill includes $110 million  for essential air service to continue  service to small and/or rural communities as well as $10 million for the  Small Community Air Service Development Program that will continue the  Department of Transportation grant  program  to help our  small communities to attract commercial air services.  Among other things, the committee  also includes $75 million for the FTA’s  Clean Fuels Grant program, $26 million  above  2007  for clean  fuel bus  technology. Public transportation companies like the Chittenden County Transportation Authority  in Vermont are  taking responsibility for their fleet’s  emissions by making  investments  in  new,  fuel-efficient,  low-carbon-emitting buses; and this  legislation supports those efforts.  In housing, the bill rejects a $2 billion cut proposed by the administration to eliminate housing programs for  the poorest citizens  in this country  and, instead, aims to make sure that  all Americans have adequate shelter.  The proposed cuts that this bill would  reject include deep cuts to HUD, Community Development Block Grants and  programs that provide housing for the  elderly and disabled. Funding  is  included so that anyone with a voucher  will not lose it. The President’s proposed cuts come at a time when fully  three-quarters of households that are  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:43 Aug 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD07\H23JY7.REC H23JY7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2007
1977,64,2007-07-23,Mr.  SESSIONS.," Madam  Speaker,  under the agreement that we just had  with the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.  WELCH),  I’m going to go ahead and  close, and then we are now through  with our speakers and allow the gentleman to do the same thing.  Madam Speaker, I will be asking for  a recorded vote on the previous question for this rule. Our country is facing  a very serious problem that must be  addressed before the House adjourns in  August, and,  to date,  the majority  Democrats have not shown a commitment  to deal  seriously nor quickly  enough with one of the most serious  threats facing America.  If the previous question is defeated, I  will offer an amendment to the Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act  that  clarifies one very simple and critical  thing; that the United States Government will no longer be required to get  a warrant to listen to foreign terrorists  who are not even located in the United  States.  The  Director  of  National  Intelligence, Michael McConnell and the Director  of  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency, Michael Hayden, have testified  to Congress that, under current law,  their  hands  are  tied. As Director  McConnell recently testified, FISA is  outdated and has been made obsolete  by technology. Today our Intelligence  Community  is  forced to obtain warrants to listen to terrorists outside of  our Nation, and, as a result, ‘‘We are  actually missing a significant portion  of what we should be getting.’’ I’ll say  it in my own way: The things that we  would expect our government to know  and be prepared for.  We simply cannot allow ourselves to  be deaf and blind to terrorist communications that threaten our very existence because of a law that is woefully  outdated. All of us have heard public  reports from the Department of Homeland Security that terrorist chatter is  at record levels that we have not seen  since 2001. We have to open our ears, we  have to open our eyes to keep this Nation safe. It can be done tonight with  our part of this, Madam Speaker.  If my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle are serious about facing down the  threat, they will join me in defeating  the  previous  question  so  that  the  House will be able to address this very  real and very  serious  threat  immediately.  I ask unanimous consent to include  my amendment and extraneous material in the CONGRESSIONALRECORD immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  ",2007

1981,64,2007-07-23,Mr.  KNOLLENBERG.," They have an incredibly  difficult job, and that is to take the responsibility that this House of Representatives has, Democrats and Republicans, to put together a transportation  infrastructure program and a  housing program, and to do that when  they have 435 Members of Congress tugging on their arms every day asking  them to include projects in their districts because the Members from those  districts sincerely believe that those  are essential to the economic development and the transportation needs and  the housing needs of the people who  live there.  b1800  And they managed to do  it. They  came in, treated every Member of this  body with enormous courtesy and patience, listened to what our requests  were, and then put together a bill that  was bipartisan. It was quite extraordinary. And it was a pleasure to be a  member of the Rules Committee and to  see these two gentlemen come up and  be mutually  complimentary after a  hard process of allocating $50 billion of  taxpayer money for infrastructure and  housing improvement in this country.  They are to be commended for that.  We then come down to the floor and  we get into the back and forth about  specific projects and try to pick and  cherry pick examples of what is bad  when it was the recommendation of the  chairman of the committee that this be  an open rule; so anybody who has got a  problem with any particular project is  going to have an opportunity to offer  amendment to strike that project and  make whatever arguments they want.  This  issue of how we  restore  the  transportation  infrastructure  of  our  country is vital. The fact is we spend  too little, not too much, and it is the  funding  issue that  is a challenge  in  every Congress. But our infrastructure  compared to many of the countries  with which we compete economically is  woefully behind what the economy of  our country needs and the citizens of  our country deserve.  I  applaud  the work  of  this  subcommittee, bipartisan work. And why  it is that we have to beat up on the  work of the committee by claiming it  is partisan, Democrat and Republican,  really escapes me. There  is nothing  partisan about meeting the infrastructure needs of our country. There may  be fierce debates about the best way to  do it, which projects should get funding, how much you allocate towards  the air system versus rail; but the fact  is we have got an obligation to improve  a  crumbling  infrastructure  in  this  country, and the bill that has been presented to this Congress on a bipartisan  basis,  under  the  leadership  of Mr.  OLVERand Mr. KNOLLENBERG, takes us  a solid step forward.  I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the previous  question and on the rule so that the  House can consider H.R. 3074.  The material previously referred to  by Mr. SESSIONSis as follows:  AMENDMENTTOH.

1984,71,2007-07-23,Mr. PASTOR.," Madam Chairman,  I  thank the chairman for yielding time.  And since this is his first bill as chairman, I congratulate him on doing an  excellent  job, and  I also thank the  ranking member.  Madam Chairman, this bill addresses  two of the most basic and very important aspects of every American citizen’s life: transportation and housing.  Unfortunately, the President’s budget proposed severe funding reductions  for transportation which could not be  realistically sustained without negative impacts on the Nation’s economy.  b2015  The  budget’s  proposal  in housing  would have cuts that harm those most  in need, including the disabled and the  elderly.  I am proud to say that, based on extensive hearings, this bill rejects those  short-sighted proposals in a fair and  measured manner  and  balances national priorities with fiscal realities.  One of the most difficult issues discussed this year involved the long-term  health of the Highway Trust Fund. Because the resolution of the Highway  Trust Fund requires the cooperation of  the administration and  the authorizers, the problem could not be solved  solely by appropriators. But this bill  grants all parties a reasonable starting  point for the resolution of this problem.  With regard to aviation, the committee found itself challenged with the  Federal Aviation Administration’s authorization about to expire at the same  time with the severe air traffic congestion which requires an entirely new approach in technology. The committee  has responded to this situation in a  very deliberate manner geared to ensure an open path to future solutions  as we look forward to the passage of  the FAA reauthorization bill  in the  coming months.  On the issue of housing assistance,  the committee has rejected the President’s proposal to substantially reduce  much-needed housing options for the  economically disadvantaged, disabled  and senior citizens. While we, regretfully, do not have the resources to fully  KNOLLENBERG address all the needs of these people,  today’s bill aims to leverage funding in  a way that stretches Federal dollars to  the maximum extent possible.  This is a fiscally sound bill. It employs none of the financial gimmicks  to distort Federal  investment. I am  proud of this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to support its passage.  ",2007
1985,71,2007-07-23,Mr. OLVER.," Madam Chairman,  I  yield 31⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman  from Ohio  (Ms. KAPTUR), a valuable  member of our subcommittee.  ",2007
1986,71,2007-07-23,Ms. KAPTUR.," I thank our fine chairman  from Massachusetts  for  recognizing  this Buckeye. And  I  thank  Chairman OLVER for  doing  a  phenomenal  job on  this bill. And also  Ranking Member  of  Michigan, my sister State, thank you  so very much for your fine work.  To both  these gentlemen,  let me  thank them for their outstanding leadership and for their commitment to investments in America. We see so much  money going abroad,  indeed billions,  hundreds of billions of dollars, and  these gentlemen have done something  for our country, for our fundamental  infrastructure, for transportation, and  for housing, the most  important  investment  any American  has,  their  most important form of savings.  In the transportation area, I want to  just  focus  in one area  important to  Ohio, and that is Amtrak. This bill is  funded at a level of $1.4 billion. And the  funding in this bill is providing critical  capital and operating assistance  to  maintain our national passenger rail  system in a manner that is environmentally  friendly and necessary. No  major industrial country in the world  does not have a modern rail system. We  need a ways to go in order to make  ours better. This bill takes a step in  that direction. Though President Bush  and some of his allies in Congress were  trying to kill passenger rail service in  the country, they cannot succeed, because Amtrak is far too important for  the Nation.  In 2006, more than 24 million passengers traveled on Amtrak. More than  67,000 passengers ride on up to 300 Amtrak trains per day. And just in our  section of Ohio,  57,000  riders make  their way through Toledo, Ohio, as a  part of that. I wish we could do more  for our high-speed rail corridors and for  alternative fuels for the large trains.  That is for the future, but at least we  make investments in the fundamental  system.  Secondly, in the area of housing, I’m  really proud of what the committee has  done, particularly to meet our Nation’s  most essential housing community development programs. Mayors around  this country will appreciate the  increase of nearly $1 billion above the  President’s request for the Community  Development Block Grant program, the  most important program for over 1,180  communities to get some of their tax  dollars back to do what they must to  run their own communities, their own  cities.

1988,78,2007-07-23,Mr. OLVER.," Madam Chairman, I rise  in opposition to the amendment. This  amendment  strikes  the  language on  page 18 of the bill that delineates how  the rescission will be applied. I remind  the gentleman from Florida, although I  suspect he does already know this, that  the rescission in the 2006 bill was $3.8  billion. The rescission in the 2007 bill  was $4.2 billion. The first of those was  passed by the Republican majority, and  the  second was  in  its  final  form  through  the CR  that  came  in  the  Democratic majority.  ",2007
1989,78,2007-07-23,Mr. MICA., Would  yield briefly?  ,2007
1990,78,2007-07-23,Mr. OLVER., Surely.  ,2007
1991,78,2007-07-23,Mr. MICA.," It  is my understanding  that is the case, but they were allowed  the  flexibility to decide on how the  funds would be expended.  ",2007
1992,78,2007-07-23,Mr. OLVER.," That  is correct. The  gentleman  is correct, the  flexibility  was there. But what we find out in that  process  is that the States very disproportionately focused that rescission  upon enhancements and took enhancements in some places completely out of  the budget, which, under the highway  fund, we are supposed to be giving 10  percent of the highway formula moneys to enhancements.  So this language was, in fact, exactly  or very similar to language which was  passed out of the T&I Committee of  which the gentleman  is the ranking  member a couple of days after we had  marked up in committee. So the T&I  Committee already has agreed to the  idea that enhancements should not be  disproportionately targeted for rescisgentleman  the  sions when they occur when they are  required by the legislation.  In fact, we were asked by the T&I  Committee to do something very similar to this, if not exactly this, which  we have done, in making certain that  there would not be disproportionate  cuts to enhancements in the process of  applying rescissions. And those data do  not really affect what has happened to  the 2007 or 2006 bills because we don’t  have the final numbers on those, but  the data that I am describing is all  through the rescission process in every  year that there has been rescissions,  that  those have  in  sum  total gone  heavily against the enhancement parts  of the formula funds. So we have striven to correct that in the language that  we have put in at this point, and I  would ask the membership to oppose  this amendment.  Madam Chairman, I yield back the  balance of my time.  ",2007

1994,78,2007-07-23,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.," Madam Chairman,  I rise  in support of the Mica  amendment.  I understand that there is a lot of  meat to what you just discussed, Mr.  Chairman, but I think the real problem  is, if you look at the AASHTO letter,  the acronym for the State group, they  recognize  this  as  something  that  should be done.  We need to maintain the rescission to  meet the funding requirements of the  bill.  I do support giving States the  greatest flexibility to meet that rescission.  I yield to the gentleman from Florida  for his closing comments.  ",2007
1995,78,2007-07-23,Mr. MICA.,"  I think the gentleman  raised some good points on the other  side. We had a vote on this, and it is a  closely divided question. But I think  all Members will hear from their State  department of transportation. We have  granted flexibility in the past. I am a  great  supporter  of  enhancements.  I  think we need things that some people  may consider not asphalt and concrete,  but things that enhance the beauty of  our highways and transportation system in this country.  But when you take a rescission of $3  billion, and States have obligations,  and we have done this in the past to  them, we have rescinded money in the  past to them, I think we need to give  them as much flexibility as possible to  make the decisions, to make those cuts  and to adjust their budgets.  They get obligated for huge amounts  of money and significant projects that  are underway. And Members throughout  this body will hear  from  their  State  department  of  transportation  that they have projects underway that  will have to be put on hold, that will be  delayed, and that will cause a great  disruption in their transportation planning  and  construction  projects. So  that’s  the  reason  that  I  think we  should give them the same flexibility  that they have had in the past. I am  not asking for any more or any less.  ",2007

1998,78,2007-07-23,Mr. OBERSTAR.," The amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. MICA), the ranking member of the  committee, is misguided and an inappropriate amendment.  As the gentleman has already acknowledged, we discussed this in committee on our climate change legislation. We had a voice vote in which the  gentleman’s amendment failed.  It would strike the provision that is  in this appropriation bill to require  States to implement their future rescissions on a proportional basis; rescissions, that is cuts of unobligated  contract authority, to make those reductions proportional.  States have applied previous rescissions in a disproportional way. They  have  disproportionately  cut  funding  from the Congestion Mitigation and  Air  Quality  Improvement  Program  that helps cities clean their air and  move people more expeditiously.  They  have  disproportionately  cut  funds from the bridge program, from  transportation enhancement funds, all  of which play critical roles in creating  mode choices and options and alternatives for moving people in our major  metropolitan areas and in rural areas.  Flexibility, States have an enormous  amount of flexibility under the current  SAFETEA–LU law. They have the ability to transfer up to 50 percent of their  programmatic apportionments to other  apportioned programs. The National  Highway System, States can transfer  100 percent from NHS funds to surface  transportation.  This language will not in any way restrict  States’  flexibility  in  implementing the highway programs to meet  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:43 Aug 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD07\H23JY7.REC H23JY7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2007

2001,85,2007-07-23,Ms. WATERS.," Madam Chairman, I  rise today in strong support of H.R.  3074,  the  fiscal year  2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill.  The  distinguished  chairman, Mr.  OBEY, and Chair of the Subcommittee  on Housing, Mr. OLVER, had to make  many difficult decisions  in drafting  this bill, and I am pleased that most of  our vital housing programs  see  increases over the President’s budget request for funding year 2008. As Chair of  the Subcommittee  on Housing  and  Community Opportunity, I believe this  bill will preserve many of the housing  programs we have fought for over the  years.  On July 12, the House passed H.R.  1851, the Section 8 Voucher Reform  Act, by an overwhelming bipartisan  majority. A central purpose of H.R.  1851  is to provide reliable, adequate  funding for the Nation’s largest subsidized housing program, buffeted in recent fiscal years.  In light of this, I am troubled that  the President once again grossly underfunded section 8 in his budget request,  asking for a mere $8 million above last  year’s funding level for the renewal of  section 8 housing vouchers, an amount  that won’t even cover the cost of inflation. I commend Chairman OLVER for  rejecting this abysmal  funding  level  and putting the dollars needed back  into the section 8 program.  I also urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up the Section 8 Voucher  Reform Act and to pass the companion  bill so that we can make needed reforms and bring stability and security  to this critical program.  I am honored to be an original cosponsor  of  the National Affordable  Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007, H.R.  2895, which will provide for the preservation and construction of 1.5 million  units of affordable housing over the  next 10 years. Because preservation begins with funding the units we have  now, I am pleased that the bill  increases the funding for project-based  rental assistance by $667 million over  the President’s request; however, I am  dismayed at the news that the Department has not paid some project-based  owners for the month of July. It isn’t  enough for us to appropriate the dollars; HUD has to get them out of the  door. I urge the Department to make  these payments on time so that we do  not risk losing owners of precious affordable housing units.  For too many years, the Nation’s  public housing program has been grossly underfunded. In 2007, PHAs will only  receive between 82 cents and 85 cents  for every dollar it costs to run public  housing, impacting their ability to repair and maintain public housing units.  By increasing funding for public housing programs to levels above the President’s request, this bill maintains our  investment in public housing. I am also  pleased  that  the committee has  rejected  the  administration’s  attempt  not only to kill the HOPE VI program,  but to take back prior-year funds appropriated by this House. The HOPE VI  program needs to be updated, but it is  a valuable program. That is why we’ll  soon introduce a bill to reauthorize and  improve HOPE VI providing for, among  other things, one-for-one replacement  and the right of residents to return to  a revitalized public housing unit.  Again, I want to applaud the committee for ensuring that the CDBG program is not severely underfunded. The  CDBG program is funded at $3.396 billion, representing a $225 million  increase compared to funding year 2006  funding  level and $959 million above  the President’s funding year 2008 request. CDBG is vital to communities  all over the country, providing valuable resources  for almost every program  imaginable  from  seniors  programs  to gang violence  eradication  programs. Without this increased level  of funding, one of the Federal Government’s  only  poverty  fighting  tools  would have been stretched to the limit,  leaving many communities desperate.  In addition, the bill provides funding  for other key programs the administration sought to zero out, including the  Brownfields,  the  Section  108  Loan  Guarantee Program, and rural housing  and economic development. The bill  also maintains critical funding for the  HOME program, Native American and  Hawaiian housing grants, fair housing  enforcement, and housing counseling.  b2145  Some of these important programs  were scheduled to expire without reauthorization, but reauthorization without funding is the equivalent of killing  a program.  Finally, the House today passed a  resolution that I was pleased to cosponsor with Congressman SHAYScommemorating the 20th anniversary of  the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. While this is not a  birthday for any of us we would prefer  to be celebrating, these programs remain effective and desperately needed.  Therefore, I am pleased that the bill  funds  the McKinney-Vento Homeless  Assistance Grant at $1.561 billion, a full  $234 million over funding year 2006.  The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will read.

2004,92,2007-07-23,Mr. OLVER.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding.  I would also like to point out to the  gentleman  from Ohio  that we have  available about, under authorization,  2.1 million vouchers of which this bill  only funds 1.9 million of them at the  level that we have provided the money  with the 4,000 additional vouchers.  I would like to remind that the authorizing committee just brought out  legislation and has added 20,000 in authorization for each of the next 5 years.  Whether we will have the funding next  year to actually provide that money, I  do not know, but they’re asking for us  not only to move upward toward filling  the vouchers that presently are authorized, but also adding some additional  ones.  And the reason for that is that we  have 8 million families roughly, 8 million households in this country which  are living at incomes below 30 percent  of the median income in their areas,  and we are only providing somewhere  in the range of 2 million, a little bit  less even in this funding, of money for  rental assistance for those people. So  we’re not coming anywhere close to  dealing with the poorest people who  are eligible under the law as it is written for that rental assistance because  their income lies below 30 percent of  median income in the area involved.

2022,99,2007-07-23,Mr. PRICE of Georgia.," Thank you  ever so much for your comments and,  once again, succinctly pointing out the  rationale for why it doesn’t make sense  for Washington  to  be  controlling  health care.  And sometimes I get the question as  a physician, what does it mean specifically? What kind of issues would the  government insert themselves into? If I  think back on personal experience that  I have, there are a number of issues  where Washington and governments insert themselves into health care. The  reason that it sometimes isn’t easy to  see is because patients don’t often see  it.  b2315  I worked for a period of time in a veterans hospital in Atlanta, and every  quarter there were a certain number of  joint replacements that were allowed  to be done at the hospital. When we got  to the end of that number, even though  it wasn’t the end of the quarter, there  were more patients that needed joint  replacements, we couldn’t do them. We  weren’t able to do them because the resources weren’t there to be able to fund  them.  Now,  the patients  that didn’t get  their joint replacement in May or June  because they were rescheduled to July  didn’t know that the reason they didn’t  get their joint replacement in May or  June wasn’t because there wasn’t anybody to do it, or there weren’t any  prostheses to implant, or the nurses  weren’t there, or the operating rooms  weren’t  functioning, no. They didn’t  know that the reason they weren’t getting it is because the Federal Government wouldn’t pay for it. That was the  reason.  So, the government inserts itself in  so many ways into the practice of medicine. Medicaid programs are a classic  example. Medicaid  programs  across  this Nation, which are government-run  health care for lower-income individuals, the vast majority of States have  formularies for drug prescription plans  in Medicaid, which means that the government is deciding which drugs are  available for folks at the lower end of  the economic spectrum. That’s wrong.  That’s simply wrong.  Now, there is a way to solve that  without the heavy hammer of the government, because when the heavy hammer of the government comes in, what  happens is that they just put more restrictions on, or they make a change,  and for 2 months it’s the right change  to make.  But government isn’t nimble, it isn’t  flexible, it can’t change easily. Even if  it made the right decision at one point  in relatively short order, it would be  the wrong decision, because  science  moves on, medicine moves on, health  care moves on. There is no way the  government can catch up, which is why  the importance of having patient-centered decisions, patients and their families making decisions in concert with  the consultation with the physician, is  so incredibly important.  I yield to my good friend from New  Jersey (Mr. GARRETT).  Mr. GARRETT of New Jersey. The  last point you make as far as the area  of intrusiveness of the Federal Government and how they are sometimes basically out of step with what is appropriate between the normal doctor-patient  relationship, maybe  that’s because the Federal Government and all  governments in general always lag behind the private sector, whatever field  you might consider, as far as innovation and moving ahead and new areas.  I mean, think about it. You can go to  the store tonight and buy any item  that you possibly want, whip out your  credit card and slip it through a machine. Within seconds that transaction  is created, and they know your credit  rating and whether you have money in  that bank account  to pay  for  that  item. It’s all done just in the blink of  an eye.  Go to your local town hall or go to  the IRS or go to anybody else like that  and see whether they are up to date  with that technology, and you will find  out they are not. Those are okay, because that’s not a life-and-death situation. But you, as a physician, know  that when it comes to a life-and-death  situation, or we all know, that we want  our children and our spouses to be able  to have the most up-to-date, the most  innovative, the most advanced technology available to them.  I think that is going to be found on  the marketplace of ideas that is in the  general marketplace, as opposed to the  convoluted, Byzantine system that we  call this, the Federal Government.  Mr. RYAN just stated that what the  Federal Government is attempting to  do here, with the expansion of this program, as we come to the floor tonight,  we mark  approximately  the  sixth  month of control of the Federal Government under Democrat  leadership.  As we mark this sixth month, we have  seen the largest expansion in taxes, the  largest tax increase in U.S. history. I  guess, as we discussed here on the floor  tonight about the Democrat plan for  the expansion of the SCHIP program,  we see the largest expansion intrusion  into the family and personal life by the  health system, by the expansion of the  SCHIP system.  The point I  just wanted to make,  though, is take a look at how the system has worked so far with respect to  the system, the distribution of money  to the States. If you go back to I guess  it was 1968 or 1969, the first couple of  years under the Nixon administration,  and he came up with a program of distributing money to the States that was  called revenue sharing. That was a new  idea at the time, and after a time we  realized it didn’t really work exactly  the way Nixon intended it to do. In  fact, he tried to do it in certain areas  like education and was never able to  get it into legislation. Yet the same  sort  of  idea  here,  in  the  original  version and the version that will be  coming out in the Senate as well.  In a similar situation that we can all  relate to, say you have four kids in  your family, and you are going to give  them all $40 to spend each week. So  you give each one of your children $10  each. So here, Child One, Two, Three,  Four,  presumably  you  have  better  names than that for them, here is $10  each. You each get to spend it on anything you want during the course of  this week. But, mind you, when the  weekend comes, if you don’t spend it, if  one of the other ones here happens to  go over their budget, and you didn’t  spend it all, what we are going to do is  redistribute those funds to the other  child there.  What do you think that your kids are  going to do? I would imagine that each  one of them is probably going to go out  as soon as they possibly can, spend  that full $10, and maybe even spend $11  just hoping that there will be some  money  left over  from their siblings  there to spend it.  Well, children, not to make the comparison here to the States, but the  States here are a lot like children in  VerDate Aug 31 2005  06:43 Aug 15, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD07\H23JY7.REC H23JY7 E N I L N O C E R G N O C h t i w 0 7 C P 1 D O R P n o r e h a m m         ",2007
2023,162,2007-07-23,Mr. ENZI.," Mr. President, today we  are going to consider the rest of the  higher education pie—the foundation of  the programs we discussed last week. I  believe that without considering both  pieces of legislation, we will not make  the changes necessary to help students  enter into and succeed in higher education.  These are all of the pieces of the  higher education pie. We see the little  red triangle there; that is the reconciliation piece which we did last week, and  it deals with the Pell grant funding,  primarily. This bill deals with  the  other pie pieces we see on this chart.  ACG, the Academic Competitiveness  grants, and the SMART grants, are  grants to students who will specialize  in  science,  technology,  engineering,  math, and  some  selected  languages.  These  grants  provide  extra  support  above the Pell grants, and that is so we  turn out the kind of people we need in  technical fields to keep the innovation  in the United States going. We passed  the America COMPETES package that  ties in with this.  Teacher quality. The key to a classroom is the teacher. We had to have a  piece  in there that would encourage  teachers and get them extra instruction so they can be better teachers.  FAFSA simplification. There are a  lot of people who have not applied for  grants because the process is so difficult. You probably saw us last week  mention  that  this was  the application—actually, these are the instructions; the applications are equally as  long. We have been able, through this  bill, to reduce that to a very simple  form for students to be able to fill out  to see if they can qualify for the Federal help that is available. There is significant Federal help available, and we  don’t want  anybody  not  attending  higher education, whether it be college  or technical school, because they don’t  have the resources for it. We are trying  to provide the resources, and now we  are trying to make sure the process  isn’t so difficult that people skip the  process and skip higher education. We  need the technical skills that are provided by a higher education, a higher  level of thought. So we now have a  much easier form.  You will also  find some  little  improvements, such as if you do work  while you are in junior high and high  school and you earn and save some  money, you won’t be penalized when  you apply for college. We want people  to be saving their money, not spending  their money so that it doesn’t count  against them when they go to make  the application.  Graduate  and  international  education, and loan disclosures are also included in this bill. There has been quite  a bit of emphasis on this lately. I was  pleased to be able, as an accountant, to  provide a  lot of suggestions  for the  ways these problems could be handled  so  that people would know exactly  what is available and so that companies and colleges dealing with  loans  would do the right thing.  Pell grants and campus-based aid are  a huge part. It complements the Pell  grant work we did last week, which  was essential to what we did in the reconciliation bill. And, of course, financial literacy. We incorporate that into  our work whenever we possibly can.  People need to know as much about  their financial situation as possible. It  is particularly critical for college students. We don’t want them winding up  in an impossible situation when they  graduate. We want them to be able to  take advantage of the resources available before they enter college.  So we have a lot of pieces that will be  completed when we  finish  the  day  today, and I am convinced we will be  able to complete this today. We have a  limited number of amendments, and  many are very reasonable and should  not be too difficult. We will have discussions on some others. We will have  a very bipartisan discussion on what  can be put in the bill to complete it,  and we will get it done today.  Why  is that  important? This year  marks  50 years  since Sputnik was  launched. That  launch sparked huge  turmoil  in  this  country and worry  about the knowledge and skills necessary to keep our economy growing  and competitive. I was in junior high  at the time. It was a shock to our Nation. Every one of us could recognize  it—teachers, parents and, probably as  important,  students,  recognized  it.  Russia was beating us. They had put a  satellite into orbit. It shocked us. But  it also brought out that American competitive spirit. We said they were not  going to beat us. It launched a change  in education such as we had not seen in  the United States in decades, maybe  centuries. We were ultimately the winners of the space race, but it wasn’t  just the space race; it was an education  race. It was the broad range of education the United States delved into  and the innovation that was brought  about at the time that put us ahead of  Russia. Of  course,  the Government  probably  helped  considerably  too.  Sputnik had a dramatic effect on our  education system and made us recognize a high  school diploma was no  longer just a nice thing to have. We  could no longer rest on our past successes as a Nation. We met the challenge of Sputnik through the National  Defense Education Act. We looked to  education as a path to continued success, and we supported an increase in  the number of people who would continue  their  education  beyond  high  school, particularly in math, science,  engineering, and technology.  We are again being challenged. For  millions of Americans, access to an affordable college education is the key to  their success in the 21st century global  economy. In the 1950s, skilled jobs comprised 20 percent of the U.S. job market. In 2000, 85 percent of all U.S. jobs  are  categorized  as  skilled. Without  some college education, these Americans will not have the qualifications  for over 90 percent of the new  jobs  being created over the next 10 years. It  is estimated that 60 percent of tomorrow’s jobs will require skills that only  20 percent of today’s workers possess.  We have a huge challenge, not just in  K–12 and higher education but in continuing education. It is estimated the  average  person  leaving  college will  change careers 14 times. I didn’t say  ‘‘change jobs’’ 14 times, I said ‘‘change  careers’’ 14 times. That is the pace at  which things are accelerating.  Here is an even more important statistic. Of those 14 career changes, 10 of  them don’t even exist now.

2028,169,2007-07-23,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, we  thank the Senator. We have made good  progress this morning on two very useful and important amendments. As we  pointed out during the discussion and  debate at the end of last week, we are  in an extremely fortunate position. We  thank the leadership, and I thank Senator ENZI for his persistence, insisting  that we deal with the authorization at  a time when we are going to deal with  the student assistance program. They  should be considered together.  We are grateful to the leadership for  giving us  the opportunity  today  to  have a good chance to consider some  ideas—as we have earlier this morning—some good  ideas on the higher  education legislation. This legislation  is long overdue, and it is appropriate  that we address it. We thank all of our  colleagues for their cooperation.  Hopefully, we will have a conclusion  of this legislation after we have the  consideration of some amendments. I  have gone through a number of amendments. They are very solid and helpful  and useful to the purpose and thrust of  I  this legislation. We will have a chance  to continue the good progress we have  made earlier.  I did wish to say a word generally  about  the  legislation  and highlight  some of the provisions. I start off by  again  thanking my  friend and  colleague  from Wyoming  for his very  strong work in this area. As I mentioned last week, our committee basically spent a great deal of time on this  reauthorization. The  legislation we  have here today—with the exception,  probably, of the provisions we have  added on the student loans and perhaps  one or two other important issues—is  very much the legislation that would  have  come  through  our  committee  under his leadership.  We have worked in a very important  tradition and we want to try to maintain that tradition of strong bipartisanship. We have tried to keep this free  from some of the other kinds of issues  people feel strongly about here on the  floor of the Senate because I think  both of us understand that the education of the young people of this country is such an overwhelming issue for  so many families that we want to try  to meet our responsibilities to them  and do it in a timely and thoughtful  way.  That has been  the  tradition, certainly marks the tradition of this particular  reauthorization  legislation.  This  is a place, I say, to  join with  members of our committee. Again, we  have—I think the Senator from Wyoming would agree—a committee that  spends a great deal of time on education  issues. Whenever we have a  markup, we have a very well-informed  discussion and debate.  There has been an enormous accumulation of knowledge—and always of  concern—by the members of our committee for these higher education bills;  people who have spent a good deal of  time on the education  issue, Republicans and Democrats alike. We have  wide diversity of our committee, urban  areas, rural areas, and we have tried to  respond to those kinds of needs. But  this reauthorization is extremely important.  Leading to the creation of the Higher  Education Act back in 1965, President  Kennedy said:  Our progress as a Nation can be no swifter  than our progress in education, our requirements for world leadership, our hopes for  economic growth, and the demands of citizenship itself in an era such as this all require the maximum development of every  young American’s  capacity. The  human  mind is our fundamental resource.  Those words rang true then, and they  ring true today, as our country is once  again in a time of war and conflict and  faces great economic challenges. Equal  access  to higher  education  touches  every aspect of American life. In order  to compete effectively  in the global  economy and ensure a well-qualified  Armed Forces, we need to equip all our  citizens with the sound education from  prekindergarten to college.  Each year, 400,000 students do not go  on to a 4-year college simply because  they cannot afford to do so.  Equally  devastating—this  is  the  400,000—it shows that some 400,000 talented students, these are qualified students, students that effectively have  the qualifications to gain entrance into  institutions of higher learning, by and  large; it is because of the lack of financial help and assistance that they do  not attend a college.  As we have seen during the debate  and discussion at the end of last week,  we need to make a very strong downpayment to provide help and assistance  to  students and graduates,  such as  through  loan  forgiveness, so that  if  they go into public service, which so  many of them want to, we provide a  forgiveness program for them that will  make a large difference.  As I mentioned last week, a key element that is going to help those 400,000  is the work that has been done by the  chairman and Senator REED to make  the FAFSA application a good deal  simpler. As we have time through the  afternoon, if others may wish to address the Senate, I will spend a little  time going through the contrast between the two, and you will see the  dramatic difference in the change we  have had.  Secondly, our second chart shows the  devastating, equally devastating, fact  that 47 percent of  low-income eight  graders will be academically—only 47  percent—will be academically prepared  for college at the time of high school  graduation, compared to 86 percent of  their higher  income peers. This  is,  again, an issue we talked about briefly  last week, the growing apart of America.  Education is the key. We do not want  to have an education system that is  going to help America grow apart. We  have made every effort in this legislation to address that broader kind of  issue. We are a better nation than that.  We are a nation that believes in promise and opportunity for all our citizens.  This bill expired in 2003. It was last  updated in 1998. We cannot afford to  wait any longer to reaffirm our commitment to higher education in this  country and create a framework so our  students are prepared to meet the challenges of this new economy.  I am immensely pleased, and I know  our committee members are, that we  were able to swiftly move to this bill  after the passage of the Higher Education Access Act last Thursday. Together, they make up the comprehensive higher education package.  Again, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator ENZI,  for the strong  support in both of these parts of our  education program and for considering  them in tandem.  The bill we passed last week includes  several critical features, provisions to  help make college affordable. We mentioned those during the debate. But it  is  important again to recognize the  need-based grant aid; a significant increase in the maximum Pell grant; the  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:20 Jul 24, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00061 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G23JY6.015 S23JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

2037,176,2007-07-23,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, Benjamin  Franklin said:  OFFICER. Who  I  Genius without education is like silver in  the mine.  What he was saying  is that silver  still in the rock, in the ore, is worthless until it is mined, taken out of the  rock. It is the same with education.  Genius without education is akin to  silver in a mine.  We have, I am sure, a lot of geniuses  who have not been educated, and that  is too bad. That is what this legislation  is all about. It is unquestioned that a  college education is the single greatest  weight on the scales of success. Yet  today, more and more working-class  Americans are shut out from the promise and opportunity of a college education because the price is out of their  reach.  Last week, we took a significant step  to restoring that promise to hundreds  of thousands of American students by  passing  the  bipartisan Higher Education Access Act. It should not go unnoticed that the $17 billion in new student aid and benefits represents the  largest increase in college assistance  since Congress passed the GI Bill of  Rights more than 50 years ago.  The bill we passed last week did this  in a comprehensive way by increasing  grant aid, expanding the number of  students eligible for Federal aid, making loan debt more manageable, and  expanding loan forgiveness options for  those professions that we all recognize  are important to society—teaching, social work, law enforcement, and health  care.  Today, in considering the higher education amendments, we authorize remaining programs and funding in the  Higher Education Act. This bill is not  weeks overdue or months overdue, it is  years overdue.  First, this legislation addresses the  recent student loan scandals. With provisions in the bill—increased disclosure  requirements,  prohibiting  payments  and gifts from lenders to colleges and  financial aid administrators, and new  restrictions on preferred lender lists—  we are finally putting an end to these  unacceptable  practices  and making  sure the student loan system works in  the interests of our students.  As importantly, we tackle the rising  costs of college. Despite the billions in  new student aid and benefits in the bill  we passed last week, if college costs  continue to rise at the rate they have  been—tripling over the past 20 years—  higher education will continue to remain further and further out of reach  for too many Americans.  I am pleased to support this legislation. I am also pleased students in Nevada have the good fortune of a State  university system with some of the  lowest costs  in the Nation. But the  same is not true everywhere, and this  bill will hold colleges accountable if  their costs increase too dramatically.  It also ensures students and parents  have information they need to make  objective decisions based on the cost of  college.  Finally, the bill phases out the unnecessarily complicated Federal financial aid form which is currently 7 pages  long—and probably more complicated  than filing out a tax return—with a  much simpler 2-page form.  Again, thanks to Senators KENNEDY  and ENZI for the work they have done  and the rest of the HELP Committee  for their work in the formulation of  this bill which, when combined with  their efforts last week, reaffirms our  commitment  to making higher education  affordable  and  accessible  to  America’s students.  ",2007
2038,176,2007-07-23,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I say  to the majority leader, we thank him  so much for scheduling this legislation,  both  the  underlying  legislation we  passed last week, which will make a  difference to students, and the authorization. I know my friend and colleague  from Wyoming,  as well  as  others,  knows we saw this authorization expire  some 3 years ago. So this is long overdue.  The idea that we passed both these  pieces of legislation together is going  to make a major difference, not only to  the students, about whom we are primarily concerned, and to their families  but also to the colleges and universities and to all the other entities in  the educational community.  We  are moving  along with  these  amendments. We are very thankful for  all the cooperation we have received  this afternoon. Hopefully, we are able  to conclude this bill either late tonight  or tomorrow. This will be a very significant and important time in terms  of educational policy for our country.  I thank the leader very much.  ",2007
2039,176,2007-07-23,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, if I may say  to my friend, the distinguished Senator  from Massachusetts, and my  friend  from Wyoming, we did not have time to  do this legislation, but we had to take  time to do this legislation. This is an  example of how committees working  together can get work done. Committees do a lot of work, but much of what  comes out of the committees is done on  a partisan basis. Democrats vote for it,  Republicans vote against it. Frankly,  we cannot get those bills to the floor.  We cannot get them done.  I repeat, we did not have time to do  this legislation. We have so much to  do. We have appropriations bills we  need to do. As soon as we finish this  bill, we are going to move to Homeland  Security appropriations, which is essential. SCHIP legislation, we have to  do that. We have to do the conference  report on  the  9/11 Commission  recommendations. We have to complete  the work we have done and gone so far  down the road on ethics and lobbying  reform.  This is an example, and I say this to  all committees, to work together such  as these two men have worked together  and we can get things done. That is  how we were able to get the Energy bill  passed earlier. We took those provisions from the Energy Committee, the  Environment and Public Works Committee, and the Commerce Committee,  on which there was unanimity, everyone agreed. I took those provisions and  put them in a package, and that was  the bill we passed in the Senate.  I appreciate Senator KENNEDYmentioning my name, but the work was  done by this committee last week and  arriving at the point where we can  have this legislation completed today.  This is important legislation.  I heard Senator WARNERon the floor  today talking about when he went in  the military. They had  those who  couldn’t read or write during World  War II raise their hand. Twenty-five  percent of the people on the ship could  not read or write. We don’t have that  situation today. But we do have a situation where there are many people,  such as the example I gave, who have  the  intellect to have a college education and simply cannot do it. It is as  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:20 Jul 24, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00068 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G23JY6.030 S23JYPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 9 6 C P 1 D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

We have a pretty good idea  now of the remaining amendments. We  are getting  in  touch with our colleagues who  intend  to  offer  those  amendments.  I expect we will have  votes, as the leader indicated, in the  early evening, and this probably will  necessitate that we will have a  few  votes in the morning tomorrow. But we  will wind up this higher education reauthorization bill, which is really the  good news.  Mr. President, how much time remains?  ",2007
2044,183,2007-07-23,The PRESIDING OFFICER., The Senator has 81⁄2minutes remaining on the  bill.  ,2007
2045,183,2007-07-23,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, I ask  the Chair to advise when  I have 1  minute left.  Finally, Mr. President, I want to review again exactly where we are on the  two pieces of legislation, one of which  we passed on Thursday night, which is  the historic increase in the need-based  grant aid, the largest increase in grant  aid since the GI bill after World War II.  We have also assisted in the management of these loans, the indebtedness,  by offering loan forgiveness and by putting a limit on loan payments at 15  percent of the discretionary  income.  Discretionary income also takes into  consideration if there are children and,  obviously,  that  reduces  the  discretionary income.  We have the loan forgiveness for borrowers who work in the public service  jobs. If you become a teacher and work  with special needs children, or work  with the disabled or the elderly, and  you do that over a 10-year period, you  will not pay more than 15 percent and  qualify for the loan forgiveness.  The bill also protects working students, so that if they work hard and  gain some money to be able to buy  some books, that they are not going to  break through these caps, need-based  caps, and they are going to be able to  buy the books and use those earnings.  This is a realistic and important aspect  of the legislation.  So this is assistance to the neediest  students, assistance for those students  from working families with middle income, and assistance for idealistic students who want to work in public service. All of that is going to be possible  under this legislation.  Under the reauthorization, the other  part which we are now on the floor of  the Senate debating, we are also making sure that the student loan system  is going to meet the ethical requirements and is going to ensure that the  best interest of the students and the  loan system is going to be protected.  We have had too many stories of inappropriate kinds of actions in the development of the loan system, which  makes it more difficult for the students and, obviously, compromises the  colleges and universities. So we have  addressed that issue in this part of the  program.  We are publicizing the cost information so that parents will understand  and get real information as to what the  cost is for the schools. We are going to  also publicize what the States are providing. If they cut back, as they have  in my own State, which has meant the  fees have gone up, parents will know  who is responsible. We hope this will  make a difference in terms of the total  cost of education.  The application itself, what they call  the FAFSA, we have simplified that so  it will no longer be a discouraging document. It will be one that will be easier  to read and be easier to utilize, particularly for those students who don’t  have the kind of support systems that  help them fill out those forms.  Finally, we have helped in the areas  of the GEAR UP and TRIO programs to  help  improve preparation  for higher  education. For one reason or another,  some students need a helping hand to  continue their education and succeed  in school. That has been true for the  TRIO and GEAR UP programs and  other programs that work with children who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds but are talented and hard working students. This  helps provide an outreach  for those  students.  Lastly, we have the programs to support higher quality teacher preparation. We understand at the end of the  day the teacher in the classroom is the  one who makes all the difference. Each  and every one of us in this Chamber  can all remember our favorite teachers, the one who inspired us, helped us,  coached us, and really encouraged us to  move ahead and grasp the opportunities of furthering our education.  Mr. President, this is a very meaningful piece of legislation. It represents  the best judgment of Republicans and  Democrats alike. We are enormously  indebted to our Republican and Democratic colleagues and all of the staffs  who have worked very long and hard on  this legislation.  We are going to have more to say on  these particular amendments, but  I  think it is useful to just give a summary of what this  legislation  is all  about. We have added to this legislation over the course of the day in some  very useful and meaningful ways. So  we are going to look forward to getting  a good vote on the final passage.  Mr. President, I believe my time is  up.  ",2007

I know  he has been working for many years to  get this accomplished, and I hope this  is the vehicle on which we will get it  done. I had the chance to chair the  Maryland Legal Services Corporation  and chaired a commission in Maryland  looking to services for our population,  and there are not enough attorneys  who will handle poverty law. There are  not enough attorneys who will handle  public defender cases. It is difficult to  get experienced prosecutors today because you can go into a private law  firm and make a lot of money, much  more than you can as a public defender  or  legal aid attorney or as a prosecutor.  The Senator’s legislation gives us a  chance to say we want to make sure  every citizen in our State has equal access to justice in our State. I applaud  him for it. I think this is what we need  to do. We have a chance in this bill to  get it done. I thank the Senator for  bringing it to the floor, and I support  his amendment.  ",2007
2058,197,2007-07-23,Mr. DURBIN.,"  In my hometown of  Springfield, IL, we have an appellant  defender program. These are young  men and women who handle cases on  appeal after the trials and work for a  government salary. When I announced  this amendment—that we had the possibility of student loan forgiveness—  two young women came to the press  conference. One of them said to me  that she has plotted out how long it  will take her, working as an appellate  defender, to pay off her student loan.  She said, ‘‘I will be paying when I qualify for Social Security.’’ That is hard  to imagine, but it is a fact. The debt  these  young  lawyers  incur  to  get  through  law school, unless they are  lucky enough to grab the brass ring  and go to a big law firm, is so large  that it haunts them for a lifetime. It  colors their life decisions as to where  they will work, whether they can own  a car, whether they can finally have an  apartment of their own and move out  of their parents’ homes. All of these  things are associated many times with  student debt.  Whether we are talking about appellate defenders or prosecutors or public  defenders, I think we want to make  sure  these young people are  spared  some of this financial worry and some  of this financial burden if they are willing to dedicate themselves to public  service. That is what this is about.  I think this is a noble calling, and I  have to recall it has not been but a few  weeks since a Justice of the Supreme  Court testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. This Justice came  and said he thought the current pay for  Federal  judges  was  inadequate  in  America.

2071,204,2007-07-23,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. President,  I  also rise in strong support of the higher education reauthorization bill before  the Senate today.  I first thank my colleague, the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor  and Pensions Committee, a true champion for education in our country. Senator KENNEDY’s vision for higher education will help make sure college is  more accessible and affordable to all  our young people regardless of their  race, their class, or their income. It is  because of the vision of Senator KENNEDY, of Senator Pell before, and others that the doors to college have been  opened to millions of Americans who  otherwise would not have had access to  that American dream.  I appreciate Senator ENZI’s  leadership as well in bringing and moving  this bill on the floor. I salute him for  all of his work, both on the bill we had  last week and now the bill we have  today. It is a tremendous testament of  what we can do when we join in a common cause.  As someone whose dreams of college  could not have been realized without  the power of the Pell grant and without other Federal aid, I am proud to be  able to support  legislation that will  open the doors for the next generation  of students in this country. Without  the critical assistance  I  received,  I  would never have been able to be the  first in my family to graduate from  college, then later from law school, and  I certainly wouldn’t be speaking here  on the floor of the Senate.  The bill before us takes great steps  toward  improving  and  leveling  the  playing field for all students so that  more students are able to access and  afford a higher education. Today, all  students do not have an equal chance  to  attend  college. As  an  example,  Latinos and African Americans are less  likely to be able to afford college and,  therefore, more likely to qualify for  Federal financial aid. Latinos and African Americans are 40 to 60 percent less  likely to earn a bachelor’s degree in  their lifetime than other students. By  also expanding Federal aid opportunities for minorities, the bill will help  improve those numbers and close the  gap in higher education.  My own story of growing up poor yet  having the opportunity to fulfill my  dream of attending college because of  Federal aid is still true as a challenge  for so many of our young people today,  and it will continue to be for the young  people of tomorrow.  The changes in this bill come at a  critical time. It is projected that by  the year 2015, 8 short years from now,  college  enrollment of African-American students will increase by 23 percent, and for Latinos that number will  increase by a whopping  73 percent.  Moreover, 75 percent of undergraduate  students are nontraditional students,  meaning they either are attending part  time and working full time, non-high  school graduates, or have dependents,  among other characteristics. The student populations of our Nation’s colleges will  increasingly  reflect  the  changing landscape of our country. So  this bill is going to help all of our students.  More and more of our students will  not be the sons and daughters of previous college graduates. The student of  tomorrow will be a mother who juggles  a full-time job and attends community  college part time at night so she can  gain skills that will lead to a better job  and provide her children economic security.  The student of tomorrow will be a  naturalized U.S. citizen who, with the  help of Federal aid, can  fulfill his  dream of becoming an engineer who  can give back to this country by helping build new infrastructure.  The student of tomorrow will be a  foster child who is able to attend college with Federal aid and fulfill her  dream of becoming a nurse so she can  not only live a stable life but give back  to a system that saved hers.  The student of tomorrow will be a  bright high school student who works  part time through college and despite  his family’s low income can attend the  college of his choice because of Pell  and Perkins.  These are the students who will help  define the students of our Nation—the  first-generation  students  breaking  through  new  barriers,  the  parents  working to improve life for their children, the naturalized citizen building a  better life in this country. They will  each be charting their own path, able  to realize their dreams because of the  opportunity only a college education  can provide.  How well educated they are will not  just determine how successful they are  in the workforce but how successful  our Nation is in the global economy.  As a nation, I am convinced that the  single greatest asset we will have in  this global economy is our collective  intellect. To be a leader globally, we  will have to be at the apex of the curve  of intellect. That means the most highly educated generation this Nation has  ever known. To get there, our education pipeline must be accessible and  affordable to a great cross-section of  young people.  However, rising costs, combined with  far too stagnant growth in family income and declining Federal aid, have  effectively priced out many students.  Even with  student  loans and work  study, today’s students have thousands  in unmet financial need they often cannot afford to pay. As a nation, we simply cannot afford to have our students  priced out of a college education. Our  Nation’s future depends on it.  The legislation before us will make  key changes to help ensure the doors to  college remain open to all, not  just  those who can afford it out of pocket.  This bill realizes that improving access  to college does not just mean increasing funding. Improving access to college means curbing rising tuition costs  so that young people will be able to  better afford a higher education. This  bill will hold colleges accountable for  rising tuition costs by making tuition  data public and available so students  and their families can compare costs.  By  publicizing  costs  to  prospective  families, colleges will need to justify  tuition increases that far exceed those  of comparable institutions.  Improving access to college means  reforming the student loan system so  students get loans that are fair, not  loans that wash them away in debt.  Outrageous loan debt is forcing borrowers to delay either buying a home  in the future or taking the dream job  of their choice after college simply because it will not pay enough. This bill  reverses this troubling trend by not  only expanding Federal aid but ensuring students are getting the best possible deal when they take out a loan.  Improving  access  to  college  also  means starting at the first step—filling  out the forms. As someone who had to  fill out the FAFSA form by myself, it  was pretty daunting. For any student  facing this process on their own or for  families with  income,  language,  or  other barriers, the financial aid process  itself can be overwhelming.

2073,218,2007-07-23,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President, I  rise  to  introduce  the  Community  Broadband Act of 2007. I am pleased to  be  joined  in  this effort by Senator  of Oregon, Senator KERRY of  Massachusetts, Senator MCCAINof Arizona, Senator MCCASKILLof Missouri,  and Senator SNOWEof Maine.  Far too many U.S. residents live in  areas of the country where there is no  broadband access. Too many others  live in areas where there may as well  be no access because broadband is so  expensive. This  legislation will promote economic development, enhance  public safety, increase educational opportunities, and improve the lives of  the people who live in those areas.  In 2004, President Bush called for universal and affordable broadband in the  U.S. by the year 2007. We are now more  than halfway  through  2007, and  the  U.S. is far from reaching this goal. Not  only has the U.S. failed to provide universal, affordable broadband, but we  are lagging far behind other countries.  A recent study by the International  Telecommunication Union shows that  the U.S. ranks 15th worldwide in the  percentage of people with broadband  connections. If you take into account  the  availability  of  affordable  broadband, the U.S. ranks 21st in the  world. The U.S. should be a leader in  providing  fast  and  affordable  broadband to its citizens.  Many of the countries ahead of the  U.S. have successfully combined public  and private efforts to deploy municipal  networks that connect their residents  and businesses with high-speed Internet services. The U.S. should be encouraging these innovative networks.  We should not be creating obstacles for  municipalities that want to provide affordable  broadband  access. Unfortunately, 14 States have passed legislation to prohibit or significantly restrict the ability of local municipalities and communities to offer advanced  communications services and capabilities to their citizens. More States are  considering such legislation. The Community Broadband Act is in response  to efforts by States to tell local communities that they cannot establish  networks for their residents, even in  communities that have no access to  broadband, in communities where access is not affordable to all residents,  and in communities that want to build  high-capacity networks that are comparable to those being built in the leading cities in the world.  The Community Broadband Act is a  simple bill. It says that no State can  prohibit a municipality from offering  high-speed  Internet  to  its  residents;  and when a municipality is a provider,  it cannot abuse its governmental authority as regulator to discriminate  against private competitors. Furthermore,  a municipality must  comply  with Federal telecommunications laws.  It also contains provisions to ensure  transparency by making sure the public is aware of its town’s or city’s effort  and intention to provide broadband either itself or in partnership with a private entity, and provides those in the  community with an opportunity to be  heard on the costs and benefits of the  project and potential alternatives.  This bill will allow communities to  make broadband decisions that would:  improve their economy and create jobs  by serving as a medium for development, particularly in rural and underserved urban areas; aid public safety  and first responders by ensuring access  to network services while on the road  and in the community; strengthen our  country’s  international  competitiveness by giving businesses the means to  compete more effectively locally, nationally, and internationally; encourage  long-distance education  through  video conferencing and other means of  sharing  knowledge  and  enhancing  learning via the Internet; and create  incentives  for public-private partnerships.  A century ago, there were efforts to  prevent local governments from offering electricity. Opponents argued that  local governments didn’t have the expertise to offer something as complex  as electricity. They also argued that  businesses would suffer if they faced  competition from cities and towns. But  local  community  leaders  recognized  that their economic survival depended  on  electrifying  their  communities.  They knew that it would take both private investment and public investment  to bring electricity to all Americans.  We  face a similar situation today.  Municipal networks can play an essential role in making broadband access  universal and affordable. We must not  put up barriers to this possibility.  Some local governments will decide  to do this; others will not. Let me be  clear, this is not going to be the right  decision  for every municipality. But  there are plenty of examples of municipalities  that  need  to  provide  broadband, and  those municipalities  should have the power to do so.  A few months ago, the Parish Council  of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana voted  unanimously to create a wireless network. Jefferson Parish, like New Orleans, was plagued with communications  problems following Hurricane Katrina.  New Orleans has already created a  wireless network. Now, Jefferson Parish plans to establish its own network  to make sure that, should another disaster strike, emergency officials and  family members will be able to communicate with one another. During nonemergency times, the network will foster  communication  between  public  workers and stimulate economic development.  These stories come from all across  the country, from small towns to underserved urban areas. The small town  of Granbury, TX, population 6,400, initiated a wireless network after waiting  years for private industry to take an  interest. In Scottsburg, IN, a city and  its 6000 residents and businesses north  of  Louisville,  KY,  could  not  get  broadband  service  from  their  local  phone company. When two important  businesses threatened to leave unless  they  could  obtain  broadband  connectivity,  municipal  officials  stepped  forward  to provide wireless  broadband throughout the town. The  town retained the two businesses and  gained much more. There are many  Granburys and Scottsburgs across the  country.  There are also underserved urban  areas, where private providers may  exist, but many in the community simply cannot afford the high prices. For  example, the City of Philadelphia reports that 90 percent of the residents of  its  affluent  neighborhoods  have  broadband, whereas only 25 percent of  residents in its low-income areas have  broadband. For that reason, Philadelphia is now creating a city-wide wireless network.  Community  broadband  networks  have the potential to create jobs, spur  economic development, and bring the  full benefits of the Information Age to  everyone. I hope my colleagues will  join Senators SMITH, KERRY, MCCAIN,  MCCASKILL, SNOWEand me in our effort  to enact  the Community Broadband  Act of 2007.

2088,239,2007-07-23,Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virgina.," Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Prince William Chapter of the American Red Cross as it  celebrates its 90th birthday.  For ninety years  the Prince William Red  Cross has provided valuable and noble service to members of our armed forces and those  in need. The Prince William Chapter has two  locations, both  in Manassas and Occoquan,  and has a rich history of faithfully serving their  community. As a result, they were recognized  this year as Prince William County’s oldest  non-profit organization.  The birth of Prince William County’s Red  Cross can be traced all the way back to President Woodrow Wilson, who signed the organization’s charter on July 24, 1917. Their charge  was  to support  the war effort during World  War  I and  their  initial campaign raised over  $2,600 for the war fund. At this time, they also  began a service aiding the troops overseas by  mailing out care packages that included hand-  knit afghans, comfort kits, homemade  jams,  etc. The Prince William Chapter continues this  tradition today as one of their many services.  They have sent our troops in Iraq numerous  packages  containing  the  soldiers’  favorite  foods, athletic equipment, CD players and correspondence  from home. This has all been  done in an effort to aid our individual soldiers  and military in every possible way.  The Red Cross has recently assumed another mission: aiding their community in preparing, responding and recovering from both  manmade and natural disasters. Last year  over 477 Prince William County residents suffered  losses during home  fires. As has become  commonplace  over  the  past  ninety  years, the Prince William Red Cross was there  to support them and provide relief in their time  of need.  Madam Speaker, in closing, I would like to  thank the Prince William Chapter of the American Red Cross for its ninety years of remarkable and devoted service to its community and  to our nation. I call upon my colleagues to join  me  in applauding  the Prince William Red  Cross on this distinguished achievement and  in wishing them many more years of continued  success.  THE COURAGE TO CARE: A TRIBUTE TO THE HEROIC ACTS OF  SIR NICHOLAS WINTON  meaning of Winton’s  legacy  to us and  the  meaning of our  struggle  for human  rights  around the world.  HON. TOM LANTOS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 23, 2007  ",2007
2089,239,2007-07-23,Mr. LANTOS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to recognize the remarkable and heroic acts of  Sir Nicholas Winton, who personally and by  his own initiative saved the lives of 669 Jewish  children  from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia  and brought them across Hitler’s Germany to  his native Great Britain. He is an immensely  compelling symbol of how the caring of one  man can  truly make a difference while confronting evil on a personal  level. Sir Winton  said  it best himself  in a  letter he wrote  in  1939,  ‘‘. . . There  is a difference between  passive goodness and active goodness. The  latter is, in my opinion, the giving of one’s time  and energy in the alleviation of pain and suffering. It entails going out, finding and helping  those who are suffering and in danger and not  merely in leading an exemplary life, in a purely  passive way of doing no wrong.’’  Nicholas Winton was guided by intuition and  character. He understood the upcoming danger and realized the importance of acting fast.  Having made many business trips to Germany  in previous years, Winton saw Jews being arrested, harassed and beaten. Thousands of  Jews  fled  to  as-yet  unoccupied Czechoslovakia, especially  to Prague. Many settled  into refugee camps in appalling conditions in  the midst of winter. Near Prague Winton visited  the  freezing  refugee  camps. His  visit  deeply affected him and he felt the need for  taking action.  He gathered information from parents who  wanted their children out and then pleaded to  countries all over the world to take them in.  He also personally raised the funds to pay for  the operation and  continued his  important  struggle even  though no  countries except  Sweden and the United Kingdom were willing  to take the children in. Further, the media refused to deal with the tragedy about to unfold.  The first 20 of ‘‘Winton’s children’’ left Prague  of March 14, 1939 and Hitler’s troops overran  all of Czechoslovakia  the very next day. By  the time World War II broke out on September  1, 1939, the rescue effort had transported 669  children out of the country.  I commend Nicholas Winton for his courage,  compassion and foresight, for his willingness  to stand up for what he believed was right in  the face of indifference and to accept responsibility for being his brother’s keeper. He has  shown  remarkable  leadership, courage and  ability of taking action when facing evil. Being  a humble man who kept quiet about his heroic  achievements for over 50 years, and without  aspirations of being called a hero, he truly has  shown complete selflessness and devotion to  others. I also congratulate Sir Nicholas’ small  group of volunteers who helped him, not only  for saving hundreds of lives but also for saving  our faith in humanity.  As time goes by, the values for which Sir  Nicholas Winton fought have increasingly penetrated the consciousness of the world. The  children, grandchildren and great-grand children of those he saved will go on to establish  a world where human rights and decency are  the priorities of civilized society. This  is  the  f  HONORING  THE  50TH  ANNIVERSARY  OF  MAPLEWOOD,  MINNESOTA  HON. BETTY McCOLLUM  OFMINNESOTA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 23, 2007  ",2007
2090,239,2007-07-23,Ms. MCCOLLUM  of Minnesota.," Madam  Speaker,  today  I  rise  to honor Maplewood,  Minnesota’s 50th anniversary.  While  the city was  incorporated 50 years  ago, the more complete history of Maplewood  began more than 150 years ago. According to  the  Maplewood  Area  Historical  Society,  Maplewood’s original residents were members  of a Dakota tribe who were drawn to the lush  land, lakes and wetlands.  In 1850, a group of  families  including  the  Bells, Caseys, Conlins,  and  the Vincents  moved from Saint Paul to settle along an old  Indian trail which is now Hazelwood Street in  Maplewood. In 1858, this area became part of  New Canada Township.  Nearly 30 years  later, a  town site was  planned at the junction of the Wisconsin Central Railroad line and the Saint Paul and Duluth Railroad that was to ‘‘rival Saint Paul.’’ In  1886, Mr. William Dawson and his wife, Mary,  platted out this village that they called Gladstone  in honor of Mr. William Gladstone, a  popular British statesman. For a time, the little  village  thrived and employed 1,000 workers.  However, this area suffered from a series, of  setbacks such as a  fire which destroyed a  major business, and which ultimately  led  to  less activity in the area.  One business which was very successful,  was a stagecoach line that ran along what is  now Edgerton Street. The line began in 1856  and cost $10 for a trip from Saint Paul to Duluth. The line remained in service until the first  railroad was built to Duluth in 1870.  After World War II, the housing boom began  as veterans  took advantage of  the GI Bill’s  home loan guaranty. Developments sprung up  around Wakefield Lake people continued to be  attracted to the area. Residents soon came together  to seek  improved services  including  sewer, water and better roads.  On February 26, 1957, in a vote of 5 to 1  New Canada Township officially incorporated  into the Village of Maplewood. Upon hearing  the new name Mr. Warren Berger went out to  his backyard and traced a maple leaf that became the village logo. By the 1970’s, the Village of Maplewood became the City of Maplewood and adopted the Council-Manager form  of government which it continues today.  Today, Maplewood is home to many major  businesses and hospitals as well as the widely  known  3M Corporation  headquarters.  The  people of Maplewood are proud of their parks  and open spaces. Maplewood has become a  leader in land conservation by protecting open  spaces and planting rainwater gardens to help  improve water quality.  Madam Speaker, in honor of the rich history  of Maplewood, Minnesota and the events celebrating it, I am pleased to submit this statement for the CONGRESSIONALRECORD recognizing Maplewood’s 50th anniversary.

2094,152,2007-07-31,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 1  minute to the distinguished majority  leader, Mr. STENYHOYER, from Maryland.  ",2007
2095,152,2007-07-31,Mr. HOYER.,"  I  thank  the  distinguished  chairman  of  the  Judiciary  Committee for yielding and thank him  for  his  extraordinary  leadership  in  bringing  this bill  to  the  floor and  would allay somewhat the grief that is  felt by the  former chairman of the  Rules Committee, the ranking Republican.  Mr. Speaker, on the one hand he says  much of this bill  is that which we  passed last time offered by our friends  on the minority side. If that is the  case, we, as I understand the premise,  we have adopted much of what you  have proposed. It’s hard to say that  you weren’t consulted when we have  adopted what your contention is, much  of what you have proposed. So I would  hope that the grief would be allayed in  that respect.  Secondly, let me say this. No conference. Why no conference? Because a  Republican Member  of  the United  States Senate wouldn’t let us go to  conference. That’s why there was no  conference. He  stood day after day  after day objecting to adopting this important reform package.  As a result, we couldn’t go to conference. So you can’t complain on the  one hand we are not  in conference  when it is a Republican Senator from  South Carolina who day after day,  week after week, objected to doing just  that.  Today is a proud day for this body.  Again, I congratulate my friend, the  distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. CONYERS, and a  dramatic example of how the Congress  that was elected last November pledging to clean up the culture of corruption is making good on its promise.  I will talk about that a little bit at  the end in terms of rules are nice, but  performance is better. Last January,  on the first day of this new, Congress  we enacted sweeping ethics changes.  Today, with  this Honest Leadership  and Open Government Act of 2007, we  have a simple, straightforward purpose,  to  continue  to  restore  public  confidence in the legislative process.  I commend Chairman CONYERS, as I  have, for his leadership in making possible this comprehensive reform measure. By shining a bright light on the  campaign contributions that registered  lobbyists bundle for Members of Congress, the conference report before us  increases transparency and gives the  American people important insight on  the legislative process.  By denying Members convicted of  crimes  their  congressional pensions,  the  conference  report  ensures  that  Members who break their oath to uphold the laws of the land will not only  suffer  public  disgrace  and  criminal  sanction, but also  lifetime  financial  loss.  There is no reason for taxpayers to  subsidize criminal behavior of Members  of Congress. Freshman Member NANCY  BOYDAdeserves a great deal of credit  for her work on this provision. By requiring Members engaged in any job  negotiations to recuse themselves from  any matter in which there is a conflict  of interest, the conference report before us will end the practice of Members trying to cash in on the legislation they steer through this body.  I don’t know how many of you had  the opportunity to watch ‘‘60 Minutes’’  this past Sunday and hear the comments of Mr. BURTONand Mr. JONES,  but that is trying to address that critical problem.  As important as this legislation and  the ethics changes made in January  are, they alone will not ensure the integrity of our process and this institution. Rather,  the Members  of  this  House will ensure the integrity of this  House when we conduct ourselves openly and honestly and hold accountable,  through a vigorous pursuit of the enforcement of our rules by the Ethics  Committee,  hold  accountable  those  who abide, do not abide by the rules in  the highest ethical standards.  Thus we have an obligation to ensure  that the Ethics Committee does the job  CONYERS that it was constituted to perform. It  did not do so in the recent Congresses.  The  implementation of  rules, while  critical, must be followed by effective  real enforcement.  This conference report is an important step forward, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  I want to thank Members on both  sides of the aisle, including Mr. SMITH,  for  the work  that  they have done  through the years to bring us to this  day and close by congratulating Mr.  and  the  leadership of our  Speaker in accomplishing this objective.  ",2007
2096,152,2007-07-31,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Speaker, I  yield myself 1 minute.  First of all, I would like to thank the  majority leader for acknowledging this  bill that we considered today largely  mirrors the Republican legislation on  ethics  from the  last Congress. As  I  mentioned in my opening statement a  few minutes ago, I went through all the  provisions that, in fact, had been carried over from the Republican bill last  year.  But  I would correct  the majority  leader in one respect, and that is many  of the Republican reforms that were included  in our motion  to  recommit  which passed successfully with largely  Democratic support earlier, all of those  Republican reforms were eliminated.  So this bill would have been much improved and much better if all the Republican reforms had, in fact, been included. I regret that was not the case.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 41⁄2minutes to  my friend and my colleague from Georgia (Mr. GINGREY).  ",2007
2097,152,2007-07-31,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise not in opposition  to this bill, in fact, I plan to support  the bill, and I think most of my colleagues will on both sides of the aisle,  but to just say that I regret that this  is an opportunity missed for the new  Democratic majority.  If it’s all about wanting to have one  more of the 6 for ’06 to take home during the August recess and say, well,  now, we have passed three of the six, I  would say that it should only be 2.25 at  the most, because, as my colleagues  have pointed out, this reform is only  about a fourth of what was brought to  us in that first couple of weeks of the  110th as part of the 6 for ’06, six promises that were made to the American  people that if you elect us, the Democrats, to a new majority, this is what  we will deliver for you.  And I will say again that this is a  tremendous opportunity missed on behalf of the new majority. This bill just  absolutely does not go far enough.  Speaking to that point, I want to  point out  that  in  the bill  that we  passed in the House last year, in the  109th, when Republicans enjoyed majority status, I had an amendment to  this bill, which I think that we need to  have as part of the bill today. It was  passed by voice vote.

2098,166,2007-07-31,Mr. ANDREWS.," Madam Speaker, I  yield myself 1 minute.  Madam Speaker, I would urge our  colleagues in both the Republican and  Democratic Parties to vote  ‘‘yes’’ in  favor of this bill.  The opponents have raised two arguments.  I believe both of  them are  wrong.  The first is that the bill repeals or  eliminates the statute of limitations.  This is not correct. What is, in fact,  correct,  is that once 180 days have  passed from the final act of discrimination, the final tainted paycheck, then  the plaintiff’s claim would be barred.  The second argument that has been  raised by the opponents of the bill is  that there would be a flood of litigation and a flood of claims that would  vex employers across the country.  This is not so. We are restoring the  law as it has existed for more than  three decades. During those three decades, there was no such flood or plague  of litigation.  This conclusion is borne out by the  Congressional Budget Office, which, in  analyzing the costs of this bill, concluded that there would be no appreciable increase in the number of claims  filed with the EEOC.  So, for these reasons and others, the  arguments raised against the bill are  I  invalid. Members should vote ‘‘yes’’ in  favor of the bill.  b1315  ",2007
2099,166,2007-07-31,Mr. MCKEON.," Madam Speaker,  yield myself the balance of the time.  We have had a good debate last night  and this morning, and the other side  has tried to make this an emotional debate about discrimination, but that is  not debate. We all, both Democrat and  Republican, oppose discrimination.  Madam Speaker,  in Congress  bad  process usually makes for bad product.  Let there be no mistake, the process  that brought H.R. 2831 to the  floor  today was incredibly sloppy. Likewise,  the product itself could not be sloppier.  The title of this bill should be, ‘‘The  End of the Statute of Limitations.’’  This bill was hastily patched  together by the Education and Labor  Committee Democrats at the behest of  the House majority leadership with the  hope of grabbing a few headlines just a  month after the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the 1964 Civil Rights Act  statute of limitations.  Neither House Republicans nor many  key outside  stakeholders were  consulted as the bill was drafted, and the  bill was not considered at a single legislative hearing. Then, again, at the behest of the House Democrat leadership,  the Rules Committee granted a completely closed rule, locking out nearly  400 Members from amending or even  considering amendments for this legislation.  Had this bill truly been a narrow fix,  as its supporters would have the American people believe, this sloppy process  may not have been such a problem.  However, this is a major fundamental  change to civil rights law and no less  than four separate statutes.  The last change to civil rights law of  this magnitude, the 1991 Civil Rights  Act, took 2 years of negotiation, debate, and bipartisan accord to accomplish. By comparison, this bill took  just 2 months. It cheapens our legislative process and, indeed, it cheapens  the work that has gone into decades of  serious considerate civil  rights  lawmaking. The legislative product itself,  as my Republican colleagues and I have  discussed, is no less flawed. It guts the  statute of limitations contained in current law and, in so doing, would allow  an employee to bring a claim against  an employer decades after the alleged  initial act of discrimination occurred.  And trial lawyers, you can be sure, are  salivating at this prospect.  Madam Speaker, this is a bad bill  that is the result of an equally bad  process. The President has threatened  to veto it should it arrive at his desk,  and rightfully so. But we should never  let it get to that point. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2007
2100,166,2007-07-31,Mr. ANDREWS.," Madam Speaker, I  yield myself the balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, this is a narrow bill  that supports a very broad principle.  The broad principle is that discrimination has no place in the lives of Americans.  This House has people working in it  whose families came here who could  not speak English but now their sons  and  daughters write  the  law. This  House has people in it whose ancestors  were brought here as slaves but now  who write the law of the land. And this  House has one person  in  it whose  grandmother could not vote but who  now is the woman who is Speaker of  the House of Representatives. When we  eliminate discrimination, great things  happen in America. When we restore  discrimination, America moves backwards.  This country is bigger and stronger  than the worst thoughts of any bigot.  Discrimination has no place in our law,  no place in our hearts, and no place because of technicalities. Vote ‘‘yes’’ in  favor  of  restoring  this  strong  tool  against discrimination.  ",2007
2101,166,2007-07-31,Mr. HARE.," Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  support of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and  commend my Chairman, Mr. MILLER for his efforts to bring this legislation forward. The Supreme Court’s decision  in Ledbetter versus  Goodyear was a  setback  for  fundamental  equal rights. As a Member of the Education  and Labor Committee I am pleased that the  House  is standing up  today  for America’s  workers by essentially  invalidating  this misguided ruling.  Mrs. Ledbetter’s pay discrimination  case  was dismissed—not because she was not  being discriminated against—but because the  Supreme Court believed she  filed her claim  too late.  Under  this  decision,  employees  in  Ledbetter’s position are forced to live with discriminatory paychecks for the rest of their careers. Moreover, the Court’s decision ignores  the realities of the workplace—where employees generally do not know enough about what  their co-workers earn or how decisions regarding pay are’ made to file a complaint precisely  when discrimination first occurs.  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would clarify that every paycheck resulting from a discriminatory pay decision constitutes a violation  of the Civil Rights Act.  When  the Supreme Court sanctions discrimination  through  technicalities or misinterpretation, it is the job of Congress to clarify  the  intent of  the  law. We start  this process  today by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay  Act. I urge all my colleagues to vote for H.R.  2831.  ",2007
2102,166,2007-07-31,Mr. ENGEL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today in  support of H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair  Pay Act of 2007. I regret that this legislation  is even necessary  in  the 21st Century, but  even today, we see instances of pay discrimination time and time again.  The reason we are bringing this legislation  to  the Floor  today  is because unfortunately,  activist  judges on  the U.S. Supreme Court  have changed  the  rules  to make  it much,  much harder  for an employee suffering pay  discrimination to bring his or her case to court.  Prior  to  that case, an employee had 180  days from her previous paycheck to file a lawsuit  for  pay  discrimination. However,  five  members of the Supreme Court, led by Justice  Samuel Alito, changed those rules. Now, an  employee has 180 days from the time of the  decision to file a lawsuit.

2110,180,2007-07-31,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Chairman, I thank  the chairwoman for yielding to me.  I am the only Californian that sits on  the Agriculture Appropriations Committee, and I am very proud that this  bill is in partnership with the progressive new provisions that were adopted  last week in the farm bill. This spends  the money to implement those provisions. As the Chair just said, this bill  takes us in a new direction, a direction  that rural America can be really proud  of.  Many people know California as the  most populous State and think of our  large metropolitan  areas.  But  few  know that California is the number one  ag-producing  State  in  the  United  States. Every one of the 58 counties in  California produces agriculture,  from  the smallest county in San Francisco,  which has nursery and flower stock, to  the most populous  county  in California, Los Angeles County, with row  crops and cattle ranches.  The new leadership in Congress has  taken us in a new direction. That direction is good news for rural America.  That is good news for fresh foods, for  fresh vegetables and fresh fruits to get  into the diet. This bill takes us in a  new direction for consumers. A new direction so that people have choices. A  new direction for green technology to  be used in the energy field. A new direction for conservation to be a part of  good management practices.  I applaud the committee’s new Chair  for taking us in a new direction and  the opportunity for farming in America  to be economically viable. This is good  because  it preserves open space and  preserves the rural character, which is  such a strength of this country.  For California, this is good news. Our  agriculture is like our technology. It’s  changing, always changing. It needs to  be state-of-the-art of technology, of research, of university work. We are the  leaders in organic growing, from wines  to artichokes. I am proud to represent  the part of California that is called the  ‘‘Salad Bowl Capital of the World.’’ The  farmers who implement the best management practices in caring not only  for their farm workers, and there is a  big discussion on that in issues with  immigration, but we have the largest  farm worker force in the United States  and they are now getting paid good  wages. In fact, a lot of them have their  own health care plans, which most  Americans don’t have, and they have  401(k)s for their families and scholarships for their children to go to school.  This  is a new attitude about  farm  workers.  I want  to  thank Congresswoman  DELAURO, the Chair of this committee,  for taking America into a new direction, a more healthy direction.  Let’s reject the reckless amendments  to this bill that undermine the positive  gains made for America. This is a good  appropriations  bill.  I  applaud  the  Chair, Mr. OBEY, for bringing it to the  floor and to the members of the committee, and I urge all my colleagues to  adopt this bill.  ",2007

2112,180,2007-07-31,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. JACKSON).  (Mr. JACKSON of Illinois asked and  was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2007
2113,180,2007-07-31,Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.," Mr. Chairman, let me first begin by congratulating the hardest-working Member of  the  Congress,  Chairwoman  DELAURO, for this outstanding bill.  Mr. Chairman, as a new member of  the Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee, I rise to voice my strong  support for H.R. 3161, the Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Again, I want to congratulate Chairwoman DELAURO and  the subcommittee staff for the product  here before us today. I also want to  thank Ranking Member KINGSTON of  the minority subcommittee staff  for  working with us to produce this product.  Over  the  past  8 months,  I have  learned a lot about agriculture policy.  When asked why I serve on this subcommittee,  considering my  largely  urban and suburban district, I quickly  respond by saying this bill touches the  lives of 647,000 residents of the Second  District of Illinois. We all eat, we all  want safe food, and we all want safe  medicines.  With the recent passage of the Farm,  Nutrition, and Bioenergy Act of 2007,  our Nation’s agriculture policy and  spending reflects our growing investROSA  ments not only in rural development  and commodity programs but in nutrition, conservation, and renewable energy. We want to continue to support  our farmers as well as feed the hungry,  protect our Nation’s food supply, and  invest in research.  One out of five Americans at some  point in time in their lives will participate in at least one domestic food assistance program. Our nutrition programs serve as the first line of defense  against combating hunger by helping  low-income  families  purchase  food.  This bill  illustrates Congress’s commitment to protecting our country’s  most vulnerable populations. It accomplishes the following:  It increases the Food Stamp Program  by $1.7 billion and creates a $3 billion  contingency reserve, which helps feed  over 26 million people annually. It restores the President’s proposed cuts to  the Commodity Supplemental Food  Program and expands the program that  serves over 485,000 people monthly by  adding five new States. It appropriates  $5.6  billion  to  the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,  Infants,  and  Children  and  restores  State grants to help administer the  program. It supports the expansion of  the simplified summer school food program that provides up to two meals a  day to children under the age of 18 during the summer.  This bill also addresses a wide variety of needs, ranging from increased  grants and loans for rural communities  to fully funding the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service.  The increases in this bill are sensible,  they are prudent, they reflect our priorities, reinforcing our commitment to  feed the hungry, to house the needy,  and to protect us all.  I recommend that my colleagues vote  against any amendments cutting these  vital programs, and  I strongly urge  them to vote for this bill.  ",2007
2114,180,2007-07-31,Mr. KINGSTON.," Mr. Chairman,  let  me just say that I think we kind of  know where we are heading on various  amendments. I  look  forward to that  amendment.  And, again, I have enjoyed working  with you and the staff. You have a  semi-good bill.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2007

I, too, want to say thank you to my  colleague, Mr. KINGSTON,  in working  with him; and it is not the first time  we have had an opportunity to work together. We have been working together  over the years.  As I said, I am very proud of the bill  and the goals that we set out and the  direction that we set out to strengthen  rural America and deal with our public  health and nutrition, energy, conservation and looking at how we invest in  our research.

2117,194,2007-07-31,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  The  CHAIRMAN.  The  gentleman  from Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2007
2118,194,2007-07-31,Mr. SHIMKUS.," Mr. Chairman, I start  a period of time in which we’re going  talk  about  to  opportunity  to  take  SCHIP.  I strike the last word to speak about  the  expansion  legislation  that was  pulled from the Energy and Commerce  Committee. Reportedly, it will be on  the floor later this week, and I would  like to highlight the damage it will do,  if enacted. Specifically, I’d like to take  this opportunity to speak about the  very popular Medicare Advantage program.  In Illinois, there are 1,715,548 Medicare beneficiaries. Of these, 145,600, or 8  percent, have selected to receive their  health care coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan. According to the  Centers  for Medicare  and Medicaid  Services, there are over 6,000 Medicare  beneficiaries in my district that are  currently enrolled in a Medicare Advantage program.  One of the most troubling things I  have heard about the Democrats’ bill is  actually from Peter Orzag, who is the  Director of the Congressional Budget  Office. The Director said that under  the Democrats’ bill, Medicare Advantage enrollment would fall by approximately 8.2 million currently to 5.5 million in 2012, a reduction of 33 percent  from current enrollment levels.  Medicare  beneficiaries  are  among  this Nation’s most vulnerable citizens,  and access to comprehensive high-quality affordable health care is imperative  to their well-being. As we well know,  the population of the United States  over age 65 is growing rapidly. The average Medicare beneficiary is likely to  have two or more chronic  illnesses.  Medicare  beneficiaries  should  have  choices for their health care coverage  similar to those available to individuals under age 65. We should allow  them to choose plans that best meet  their unique health care needs and to  help them coordinate their care, manage their  illnesses, and reduce their  out-of-pocket costs.  On average, beneficiaries that choose  a Medicare Advantage plan in Illinois  are receiving over $60 in extra value  each month  from  their plans. This  extra value comes in the form of savings on cost sharing and out-of-pocket  protections and on lower part D premiums, or additional benefits like coverage  for vision and hearing. Beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage plans  report  better  access  to  care, more  usual sources of care, and more likelihood of seeking care when needed than  beneficiaries in traditional fee-for-service operations.  CMS has recently reported that beneficiaries in fee-for-service with no additional sources of coverage have more  difficulty getting care and are  less  likely to have usual source of care than  Medicare Advantage enrollees.  All Medicare beneficiaries have access to a Medicare Advantage plan that  does  not  require  cost  sharing  for  screenings for breast cancer, cervical  cancer and prostate cancer. Recently,  CMS has reported that Medicare Advantage enrollees are more likely to  receive preventative services, such as  immunizations, mammography,  and  screenings for colorectal and prostate  cancers.  Critics have implied that the Medicare Advantage program  is contributing to the solvency problems facing  the Medicare  trust  fund. However,  these critics fail to recognize the extra  value that Medicare Advantage plans  provide that address the real drivers in  increasing program costs. Medicare Advantage plans help control the volume  and intensity of services used by beneficiaries in Medicare part A and part D  by coordinating care, improving health  outcomes,  and monitoring  enrollee  usage.  Medicare Advantage generates savings in the part D program by helping  to drive down the average premium  paid  by  the  government  and  beneficiaries, and by reducing Federal expenditures for beneficiaries eligible for  low-income subsidies.  Critics have  further distorted  the  facts  by  offering  information  that  claims to suggest a ‘‘fairness gap’’ between Medicare Advantage payments  and the other providers. In fact, Medicare Advantage payment rates increase  in direct proportion  to  the Federal  Government’s estimates of increases in  per capita costs in the fee-for-service  program.  Some critics suggest that legislators  must choose between providing comprehensive health coverage options to  Illinois seniors through the Medicare  Advantage program or providing coverage  to  Illinois uninsured  children  through SCHIP. Both programs play a  crucial role in serving vulnerable populations. We should focus on devoting  adequate resources to both SCHIP and  Medicare Advantage, while working to  maintain and strengthen all components of our Nation’s health care safety net.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  AMENDMENTNO. 3OFFEREDBYMR. GINGREY  ",2007

But we also  have the comfort of knowing that when  dawn comes, we have the opportunity,  through health insurance, to seek out  health care through a pediatrician or,  if it should be worse, to be able to go to  the emergency room and know we are  covered, to know we can seek that  health care for our children when they  need it the most, with the confidence  that with that health insurance we can  continue to care for their needs.  In situations such as these, health insurance coverage is critical not only to  the lifelong health of a child but also  to a family’s peace of mind. I think  that is what we are about here today—  our ability as Senators to be able to  step outside the box of being a Senator  and really think about what it means  to be a hard-working American, to be a  parent, and to not just think of what it  means to us and our families as Federal employees and what we have access to in health care but translating  that to the needs of all hard-working  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:28 Aug 01, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G31JY6.017 S31JYPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

2132,215,2007-07-31,Mr. WYDEN.," Mr. President, since the  Senator  from Iowa has been talking  about the efforts of Senator BENNETT  and I and how it relates to the children’s health program, I wish to take a  few minutes to discuss that relationship.  First, I think Senator BAUCUS, Senator ROCKEFELLER, Senator GRASSLEY,  and Senator HATCH—through the hours  and hours of effort they have put into  making the children’s health proposal  ready  for  floor action—have done a  great service. They have done a great  service, first and foremost, to the country’s kids.  It seems to me every single Member  of the Senate can say today we cannot  afford, in a country as good and strong  and rich as ours, to have so many kids  go  to bed at night without decent  health care. As a result of the bipartisan work of four Members of the Senate—two Democrats and two Republicans—we have laid the foundation to  take steps immediately to help youngsters who  are  falling  between  the  cracks.  I have long felt the challenge with respect to health care today is twofold.  First, you act  immediately  to help  those who are the most vulnerable in  our society. That is, in fact, what four  members of the Senate Finance Committee have helped the Senate to promote today. Second, we ought to be  taking steps on a broader basis to fix  health care in our country.  We are spending enough money on  health care today. We are not spending  it in the right places. We are spending  enough money  today  on American  health care to be able to go out and  hire a doctor for every seven families  in  the United States. That  doctor  would do nothing except take care of  seven families. Pay the doctor $200,000  a year, and my guess is, the distinguished Presiding Officer would probably have physicians in the State of  Delaware come to him and say, ‘‘Where  do you go to get your seven families?’’  because they would all like to be practicing physicians again. So we are  spending enough money on health care  today. We are not spending it in the  right places.  At a time when our population  is  growing so rapidly, when costs are skyrocketing out of control, we need to fix  American health care. But in order to  get to the broader health reform effort—an effort that is bipartisan, with  Senator BENNETT joining me  in the  first bipartisan health reform bill in 13  years—you have to take steps to meet  the needs of youngsters today.  The Senate has already said that on  multiple occasions. We said it first by  passing the children’s health program,  and now, through the reauthorization  effort, we say kids will come first. We  also said it, in fact, through the budget  resolution, where there was an effort to  look at the relationship between broader health reform and care for kids, and  the Senate, again, said children will  come first.  So I am very hopeful. I believe consideration of the children’s health program is, essentially, the opening bell of  round one in the fight to fix health  care. If we can tackle the issue of children’s health in a bipartisan way—the  way  the Senate Finance Committee  has done—it ought to be possible, even  in this session of Congress, to move on  to broader health reform.  Now, I am very hopeful the Administration will join in this bipartisan effort. We have all read about discussions  about a possible veto message. I am  very hopeful the Administration will  join discussions in the Senate, join discussions in the other body, and help us  to move quickly on the issue of children’s health.  If we do that, it ought to be possible,  as the distinguished Senator from Iowa  has indicated, to move on to something  the  Administration  feels  strongly  about, where I happen to think, by and  large, they are correct.

2133,222,2007-07-31,Mr. CASEY.," I will not read it, but I  want to highlight some of what he said.  He  talked about  the President and  what has been happening with this debate on children’s health insurance. He  made this point in the second to the  last paragraph:  Treating health insurance for needy children as a political bargaining chip—  And he’s referring to the President’s  other health care ideas——  would be wrong.  He talks about the fact that Mitch  Daniels, who worked in a Republican  administration—he  is  the Governor  now, Governor of Indiana, also a great  supporter of this program. Mr. Dilulio  concludes this way. He says:  For  compassion’s  sake,  the  should compromise on SCHIP . . .  President  And allow this to move forward.  I have to say, some of what we heard  in the last couple of days has been misleading. In the end it is about this: It is  about whether we are going to be fair  to families across America, not whether  the Senate  likes  a  program  or  doesn’t like it. This is about whether  we are going to be fair to families.  Anyone who has had the experience  of being a parent knows when their  child  is born,  that parent, whoever  they are, falls in love again. My wife  and I have four daughters, and we know  that feeling. So many others here do as  well. As a parent, you always want to  love your children and protect them.  When a child is injured or gets sick,  the first instinct of any parent, but especially a mother, is to hug that child,  to dry their tears, and to soothe their  pain  immediately—not months  later,  not days  later, but  immediately. Of  course if it is more serious you want to  get them to a doctor or a hospital.  But for millions of parents—that is  why this bill is so important to get  done—for millions of parents that hug  that they give their son or daughter,  that warm embrace and the comfort  that a hug can bring to a child—that  will often be all that they have at the  end of the road because their son or  daughter has no health insurance, like  the millions of children we have talked  about in the last couple of days. If that  child cries in the dark of night from  pain or if they endure the slow ache of  disease or sickness, the mother cannot  bring the full measure of her love to  that child. In essence, the mother is  rendered powerless because of  that.  Just think of what that does to a  mother and to a family.  When we have debates on this floor  about this bill, none of it matters—  none of the debate in the last couple of  days will have mattered if it does not  result in a total commitment to the  children of America. Unfortunately, if  the President gets his way, we will  have failed that basic test about a full  commitment to our children.  I will conclude with one line. When  my father served as Governor of Pennsylvania, it was one of the first States  to have a children’s health insurance  program. He knew the benefits of it.  His test  for every public official  in  every difficult fight was very simple,  but it is a very tough test: What did  you do when you had the power?  This Senate has the power this week  to tell the President that he is wrong  about children’s health insurance, but  more important to tell America that  we have made a full commitment to  the children of America. If we pass that  test we will have done our job. If this  body does not, it will have failed that  test when we had the power to positively impact millions of children, to  have exercised that power on behalf of  that child, his or her family, and all of  America.  I yield the floor.  ",2007

2144,236,2007-07-31,Mr. BURR.," Mr. President, I think it  is safe to say that health care is probably one of the most important things  this body can debate. I think you have  to look at our overall health care system today to understand why it is so  important. It is because we have the  best health care delivery system in the  world, bar none.  We have seen other countries try to  develop a  system  that  fit within a  budget framework that, over time, as  the dollars got tight, constricted the  level of care delivered, creating waiting lines for individuals who had certain health conditions. But the United  States has always been considered the  innovative health care delivery system  of the world. It was accessible for most,  regardless of region. I think it is safe  to say for a long period of time it was  very  affordable.  But  that  has  all  changed.  The U.S. system still provides a level  of security if, in fact, you are insured.  If you are not insured, I am not sure  the  sense of  security—just knowing  there  is a hospital or doctors—necessarily provides you with a tremendous amount of security.  With every day that continues on,  the level of choice that exists within  the United States health care system  begins to get less and less. Most of us  have been here for the debates of the  creation of HMOs and PPOs, and all the  products that employers, insurers, and  individuals desperately try to create to  address this rising cost of health care,  while maintaining some degree of benefit  for the  individual and  for their  family. But over time, we have continued to see changes to those products,  to where there is very little difference  between the products now except for  what we call them. Clearly, that has  eliminated many of the choices.  What has happened to the U.S. system, over a very slow period of time,  maybe the last two decades? Over 50  percent of the American people are now  on a Government health care plan. It is  no longer private-sector driven. We are  here with this big question mark about  why market conditions do not affect  the cost of health care or the cost of  premiums or that they do not create  choice. In fact, over half of the American people are now in a Government-  run  system, one  that mirrors more  what others in the country have tried,  only to find out that unless you have  an unlimited pool of money, they do  not work.  Well, what do Government systems  eventually create? They create a system that has less doctors, less nurses,  less hospitals, which means less care  for those in the country.  I know  the  ranking member  represents a State that is considered to be  rural. North Carolina is a State considered to be rural. If you have a contraction of doctors, if you have a contraction of specialists,  if you have  less  nurses in the pool, it means there is  not enough to go around all the facilities. There are many regional areas of  my State today where we cannot find  OB/GYNs to deliver babies.  Now, sure, I can look at a pregnant  woman and say: Within a 30 or 45-mile  radius, you will be able to get delivery  care. But try to explain to a mother,  when her water breaks and she goes  into labor, that the person who is going  to deliver that baby is 45 miles away.  In fact, the prenatal care, for that individual who needs it, is now 45 miles  away because that is where her OB/  GYN is, and we are not going to be able  to get the  level of prenatal care  in  rural America that we want.  What has the Government controlling more of health care produced? Less  choices, fewer providers, and less services, and especially for those limited  amounts of services that are preventive.  Let me state from the beginning of  this debate, I am for reauthorizing the  SCHIP bill.  I will support the substitute that Senator MCCONNELLwill  offer which provides $38.9 billion over 5  years, which is an increase of $13.9 billion.  I also was in the House, on the Energy  and Commerce Committee,  in  1997, when we enacted the first SCHIP  bill, which was a $40 billion Federal  commitment over 10 years to those  children at 200 percent of poverty or  less. Many States expanded that SCHIP  program to cover parents of SCHIP  kids and childless adults.  The McConnell reauthorization protects the original SCHIP program by  making sure that low-income children  are the focus of our effort.  Now, I will say, North Carolina has  one of the best SCHIP programs in the  United States. I am pleased that Senator MCCONNELL’s reauthorization will  give North Carolina  the  additional  funds it needs to continue serving low-  income children. But I am, sadly, here  today to tell you I am not for expanding the rolls of SCHIP. The Finance  Committee bill adds more than $30 billion to the current SCHIP base budget—$25 billion—to, roughly, cover 3.3  million additional children.  Now, CBO scored what the State and  Federal Government spending will be  per child. Let me put that up for everybody: $3,930 per child. Yet, today, the  average private health care plan in the  private sector is $1,130. My question is,  if we are going to spend $3,900 per child  in a Government plan, but we can insure them fully in the private sector  today for $1,130, where is the choice? As  a colleague of ours in the House used to  say: Beam me up, Scotty. Something is  wrong here. This  seems  like a no-  brainer. This is not an investment that  one can make on the part of American  taxpayers and feel good about.  In 1997, we spent $40 billion. It was an  honorable goal. Quite frankly, the program has been very popular. The Baucus  reauthorization  plan,  though,  would spend $60 billion over the next 5  years.  Now, people will talk about budget  gimmicks. I am not here to talk about  that. I think they are here. I think it  hides millions of dollars that I think  are extra spending—and maybe they  are going to insure this 3.3 million, and  $3,900 per child is incorrect, or maybe  there are more people who are going to  be covered, and many of them outside  of the ranks of low-income children—  but there is no question the Baucus-  Grassley bill expands SCHIP so much  that I feel children who need it the  most will get lost in a new, larger Government-run program.  As a matter of fact, if SCHIP works  as well as I think it does, why would we  change it? I think some would tell us  we are not here changing the SCHIP  program. But I would only point to section 606 of the Grassley-Baucus bill,  where they remove the word ‘‘State’’  from the name of SCHIP. See, SCHIP is  the State Children’s Health Insurance  Program. It was always designed as us  being an enhanced share for the States,  and the States running the program.  Now, SCHIP is going to be called the  Children’s Health Insurance Program.  It sounds like a big, one-size-fits-all  Government program to me.  The solution to our health care crisis  is not to put every child in America in  a Government program. Today, one out  of every two children in America is in  a Government program. They are either enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP.  The Baucus plan puts more children  into Government health care. A recent  CBO analysis concluded that for every  1 million additional children covered  under SCHIP, an estimated 250,000 to  500,000 will be switched from private insurance to the new public SCHIP coverage.  Now, let me say that again. CBO estimates—this is not me—CBO estimates  that for every 1 million new kids we  put  into SCHIP, somewhere between  250,000 to 500,000 will switch from their  parents’ insurance to the new Government plan.  Now, that is 3.3 million kids, which  means 1.65 million could be switched  from private insurance to Government  insurance, at 3,900 and some dollars, estimated by CBO. Again, where is the  sanity and the obligation and fiduciary  responsibility we have  to  the  taxpayers? Why in the world would we create an avenue for people to go off their  family’s plan and come on a Government plan, where we are committed, as  CBO said, to spend $3,900, roughly, per  child?  Now, before people think we are all  insane—they know  I am now—what  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:32 Aug 01, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G31JY6.065 S31JYPT1 E T A N E S M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

2148,264,2007-07-31,Mr. WHITEHOUSE.," Mr. President, I  speak today  in support of the Children’s Health  Insurance Program.  I  want to first applaud the Finance Committee for its bipartisan 17-to-4 vote to  approve  this bill.  I  thank Senators  BAUCUS, ROCKEFELLER, GRASSLEY, and  HATCH, Majority Leader REID, and also  the staff of the Finance Committee for  all their hard work through the very  difficult negotiations that made it possible to bring this critical measure so  strongly to the floor.  I also recognize Rhode Island’s role  in this piece of legislation, going all  the way back to the distinguished Senator John Chafee, one of the early bipartisan sponsors of the bill. Now on  the  floor today, my senior Senator,  JACKREED, has been one of the most  powerful and outstanding advocates for  this program in this institution. I am  proud to join him in supporting this  bill and in this fight.  I am proud also to represent a State  with one of the lowest rates of uninsured adults and children in the Nation. There is a reason. Rhode Island  has worked over the past 15 years to  achieve this success, beginning with  the RIteCare program in 1993. In 2001,  the creation of this Children’s Health  Insurance Program allowed Rhode Island to further reduce the number of  uninsured children in the State. I am  proud to have been part of Gov. Bruce  Sundlun’s team when he started the  original RIteCare program in 1993.  As health care costs skyrocket, and  the number of people in this country  who lack health insurance approaches  the staggering number of 50 million, we  in Congress have  an  obligation  to  strengthen  initiatives  like RIteCare  that make health care more accessible.  For years, the Children’s Health Insurance Program has given millions of  uninsured American families access to  health care for their kids. And pretty  much everyone has thought this was a  good thing. But now, setting aside reason, and driven by ideology, President  Bush has threatened to lift his veto pen  for only the fourth time in his Presidency to take that security and peace  of mind away from these children and  from their worried moms and dads,  from families similar to the ones the  Senator from Ohio highlighted in his  eloquent remarks a moment ago.  The President claims the $35 billion  improvement over 5 years is too expensive. The President would prefer only  the $5 billion he included in his budget.  But that funding level would result in  1 million American  children  losing  their health  insurance. We certainly  cannot look to President Bush for leadership.  How ironic, after all we have heard  from this administration praising the  State Children’s Health Insurance Program and even taking credit for expanding  coverage,  for  encouraging  State flexibility, and for spurring innovation at the State level.  Listen to what they used to say. In  the administration’s plan outlining the  President’s  second  term,  their  fact  sheet boasted:  The year before President Bush took office,  some 3.3 million low-income children were  enrolled in SCHIP. By 2003, that number had  risen to 5.8 million, a 75 percent increase.  Over that same period, by working cooperatively with State Governors, the Department  of Health and Human Services increased the  number of low-income adults on Medicaid by  6.8 million.  That was then, this is now.  After that, the administration went  on to lament the fact that ‘‘millions of  children who are eligible for SCHIP or  Medicaid coverage are not yet enrolled.  Billions in Federal dollars available to  the States to insure these children remain unspent because these children  haven’t been signed up.’’  Then, at  the  2004 Republican National  Convention,  President  Bush  promised this:  In a new term, we will lead an aggressive  effort to enroll millions of poor children who  are eligible but not signed up for the Government’s health insurance programs. We will  not allow a lack of attention or information  to stand between these children and the  health care they need.  But now the same Bush administration, the same President,  is aggressively planning to deny health insurance to poor children. How does this  make any sense?  The President’s  rationale  for  this  new parsimony was revealed before an  audience in Cleveland on July 10.

Dr. DeHaven began his APHIS career  working in a field office for the veterinary services program in 1979. He later  joined the agency’s animal care program, rising to the top position in 1996.  From 2001 to 2002 he served as the  APHIS acting associate administrator,  and in 2002, became head of the agency’s veterinary services program.  As the Nation’s chief veterinarian, he  played a  leading role as the agency  faced the first U.S. detection of bovine  spongiform  encephalopathy, BSE,  in  2003. His handling of this situation—as  well as other animal health  emergencies—showcased  his  trademark  straightforward  leadership  style and  calm demeanor. These challenges prepared him well for the role of APHIS  Administrator, which he assumed  in  2004.  As Administrator, he has skillfully  guided his agency and communicated  with the public, Congress, and USDA’s  many  stakeholders. He worked conscientiously to position APHIS to prevent and respond to such threats as  highly pathogenic avian influenza, exotic Newcastle  disease,  sudden  oak  death, Asian longhorned beetle and citrus diseases.  Dr.  DeHaven’s  dedication,  work  ethic, and personal commitment to excellence have served U.S. agriculture  well and ensured a healthy and abundant food supply for U.S consumers.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL J.

Donoghue on his retirement from the  Worcester Regional Retirement System. I commend him for his impressive  service to the people of Worcester for  the past 30 years, and I know he will be  deeply missed by all those he helped  and supported.  Mike’s  impressive  career  extends  well beyond his time at Worcester Regional Retirement System.

Mike also has served on the board of  directors of  the Worcester Regional  Chamber of Commerce and the Massachusetts Biomedical Initiatives, and he  had an invaluable role over the years  in establishing Worcester as a center  for medical research.  All of us in our State owe Mike our  gratitude for his skillful efforts on behalf of the  less  fortunate. Over the  years, he has given his skills and impressive leadership to the board of directors for the Visiting Nurses Association Network Foundation, the Worcester Area Mental Health Association,  the Worcester Area United Way, and  Special Olympics of Massachusetts.  It has been an honor to call Mike a  friend, and I am especially grateful for  his decades of kindness to the Kennedy  family. I have relied often on Mike  over the years for his advice and wise  counsel, and I commend him for his  service and dedication.

2151,271,2007-07-31,Mr. REED.," Mr. President, today, on  behalf of the Greek Cypriot population  of Rhode Island and Greek Cypriots  around the world, I recognize the 33rd  anniversary of the Turkish invasion of  Cyprus.  At 5:30 a.m. 33 years ago today, heavily armed Turkish troops landed on a  narrow northern beachhead in Cyprus 5  days after Greek Cypriot nationalists  ousted  then-President  Archbishop  Makarios. The invasion and subsequent  occupation was described by Turkey as  a ‘‘peace operation’’ to protect the minority Turkish population living in Cyprus from being victimized in the aftermath of the coup.  However, during the next 2 months,  over 200,000 Greek Cypriots fled south  or were expelled by Turkish forces. The  Turkish Cypriots took over 37 percent  of  the  island  and  then  called  a  ceasefire, leaving the Greek Cypriots,  82  percent  of  the  population, with  under two-thirds of Cyprus. In 1983, the  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  declared  itself a country. Currently,  Turkey is the only nation that recognizes this self-declaration of statehood.  Despite international efforts over the  last 30 years to reunify the island, Cyprus has remained divided with more  than 40,000 Turkish troops occupying  its northern third. The United Nations  Security Council and General Assembly have worked to determine an equally agreeable solution, but talks between the Greek Cypriot south and the  Turkish Cypriot north consistently end  in a stalemate.  A survey completed in February 2007  by the United Nations Peacekeeping  Force in Cyprus found that a majority  of both Greek and Turkish Cypriot  communities view the United Nations’  presence on the island as a positive.  Both see any withdrawal scenario involving the U.N. departing before restoration of normal conditions and a  settlement being reached as a negative.  We must applaud the continued efforts  of the United Nations and the focus of  Cypriot leaders to reunite a divided Cyprus and remain, ourselves, committed  to ushering the settlement process forward.  Cypriot, Mediterranean,  and  United States  interests will benefit  from a settlement that addresses all legitimate concerns of both sides and  promotes the stability of a hostile region.

2178,390,2007-07-31,Mr. WEXLER.," Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 1, Improving America’s Security Act  of 2007, which includes critical security provisions endorsed by  the 9/11 Commission as  well as an overdue expansion of  the visa  waiver program, VWP.  Mr. Speaker, the visa waiver program is an  immensely valuable program  for  the United  States, and the legislation before us will not  only enable us to expand the visa waiver program  to additional allies who already offer  U.S. citizens visa-free travel to their countries,  but simultaneously strengthen the security aspects of the program.  Although H.R. 1 expands the VWP, I would  have preferred that the program expand to all  the roadmap countries, among them some of  America’s most important and loyal allies, and  I am hopeful Congress will take steps to address this issue in the near future.  Despite my concerns  that some  roadmap  countries may be excluded, this legislation is  an important step towards addressing the security concerns  that members of Congress  have articulated about  the visa waiver program.  I am confident  that once  the security  measures outlined in H.R. 1 are implemented,  those members of Congress who previously  had concerns about the program will be open  to considering  further expansion of  the visa  waiver program.  In  the meantime,  it  is  imperative  that  the  Bush Administration and Congress continue to  work with our allies, who deserve to participate in the program. The United States should  also provide assistance to help these governments reduce their visa refusal rates and meet  all the necessary requirements detailed in the  Improving America’s Security Act.  It is clear that H.R. 1 fulfills key 9/11 Commission  recommendations and  improves  the  security aspects of the visa waiver program,  and I applaud my colleagues for their efforts to  make our country safer and  further expand  this program. However, America cannot successfully fight the battle against international  terrorism without the cooperation and trust of  our allies.  I would  like  to  remind my colleagues  that  the  9/11  Commission  also  stressed the need for diplomacy and cooperation with other Nations to address the threat of  international terrorism. In this vein, further expansion of the visa waiver program can play  a vital role in strengthening America’s relationships and security partnerships with our most  trusted allies—which is essential to preventing  another 9/11 disaster.  f  FARM, NUTRITION, AND  BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007  SPEECHOF  HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER  OFMISSOURI  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 26, 2007  The House  in Committee of the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 2419) to provide  for  the continuation of agricultural programs through fiscal year 2012, and for other  purposes:  ",2007
2179,390,2007-07-31,Mr. CLEAVER.," Madam Chairman, I would  like to express my support for the amendment  to the Farm Bill Extension Act of 2007, H.R.  2419, offered by my  friend Mr. FRANK from  Massachusetts. The amendment aims  to remove the expansions in the underlying legislation that would expand the Farm Credit System. The Farm Credit System is a $163 billion  direct  lending Government sponsored enterprise that has its own regulatory system and  preferential borrowing authority.  The proposed expansions of the Farm Credit System in the original measure would have  diluted farmer ownership of farm cooperatives  and would have undermined farm cooperative  principles. Fortunately, the Frank amendment  passed last night by a voice vote, as these extensions of the Farm Credit System clearly did  not have  the support of  the majority of my  House colleagues. Because  the amendment  was approved, the Farm Credit System is better able to serve its intended constituency by  providing  credit  directly  to  family  farmers,  ranchers, and farmer-owned cooperatives.  The  protections  afforded  by  the  Frank  amendment to the farming sector are also reflected in protecting our financial institutions by  preventing  an  unwarranted  expansion  into  mainstream banking activities. Our Nation’s financial  institutions have continued  to evolve  and meet  the needs of consumers over  the  years. These  innovations should continue  to  be fostered while maintaining the security and  independence of our financial institutions.  I applaud  the passage of  the Farm Bill,  which will provide our Nation’s  farmers with  meaningful and necessary assistance for the  next 5 years. I look forward to continuing to  work with my House colleagues to enact effective reform in the financial sector as well.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

2183,397,2007-07-31,Mrs. JONES of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today to honor the 75th anniversary of Pierre’s  Ice Cream Shop. Pierre’s Ice Cream Company  was founded in the Cleveland area and has  been a family-owned business since 1932.  Pierre’s founder, Alexander ‘‘Pierre’’ Basset  was the inventor of the original recipe for their  delicious gourmet ice cream. Three quarters of  a century later, Pierre’s Ice Cream Company  continues to uphold a standard of excellence  in customer service and quality products.  It did not take long for Sol Roth, the owner  of  the Cleveland based Royal  Ice Cream  Company to recognize the value, uniqueness,  and potential of Pierre’s Ice Cream Shop. As  time progressed, country clubs,  restaurants,  and other gourmet venues began marketing  Pierre’s brand of ice cream. In 1960, Roth acquired Pierre’s Ice Cream Company and dedicated all of his resources to displaying and expanding its special recipe.  In 1979, Roth requested his daughter Shelley to assist him with the business. In 1991,  Shelley Roth became the president and chief  executive of  the company, overseeing 125  employees, the production, and distribution of  more  than 235 kinds of  ice cream, sherbet,  sorbet, frozen yogurt, and novelties.  In  1995,  Pierre’s  built  a  contemporary  40,000  square  foot distribution  center and  16,000 square foot office headquarters on the  land it originally purchased in Cleveland, Ohio.  Sol  passed  away  in  2005;  however,  his  daughter  Shelley  continues  Pierre’s  outstanding legacy today.  On behalf of the people of the 11th Congressional District, I wish to commend Pierre’s  Ice Cream Company on  their 75th anniversary. Their existence  is a  true  testament  to  family values and dedication, and  the continuing legacy of the American dream.  f  TRIBUTE TO KENNETH MYERS  HON. KENDRICK B.

2184,397,2007-07-31,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Madam Speaker, I rise  today to pay tribute to the late Kenneth Myers,  a fellow Florida Legislator and outstanding attorney in the Miami community.  During Mr. Myers distinguished career in the  Florida House of Representatives and Florida  Senate, he displayed a dedication and commitment to strengthening the state of Florida.  Serving 4 years in the House of Representatives and 12 years in the State Senate, Mr.  Myers sponsored more  than 200 bills  that  strengthened Florida and our sense of social  justice. He personified the essential qualities  of a great community leader and earned his  place among the pillars of our community.  Mr. Myers was  a  brilliant  attorney  and  proudly practiced law with his father for over  thirty years. When his father retired, he joined  another distinguished law firm and continued  with compassion his path  for  justice  in our  South Florida community. Mr. Myers’ sincere  involvement instilled a profound impact on the  community, resulting  in many awards, accolades and honors including a Coconut Grove  park named in his honor.  Mr. Myers lived a stunning life, graduating  from Miami High School in 1950 then pursuing  higher education at  the University of North  Carolina, Chapel Hill. He proceeded  to  the  University of Florida, School of Law. Mr.  Myers’ devotion to education led him to serve  as a member of the prestigious University of  Miami Board of Trustees for 25 years.  Mr. Myers’ is survived by his sister and my  esteemed friend, the Jewish Community Relations Council Director Judy Gilbert-Gould and  her husband, Gerald Gould. He  is also survived by his nieces Nancy Gilbert, Carolyn Gilbert Epstein and Belinda Gilbert; his nephew  Robert C. Gilbert, an officer of  the Greater  Miami Jewish Federation Board; Mark Gilbert,  and eight grandnephews and grandnieces. Mr.  Myers was the son of the Federation’s Founding President, Stanley C. Myers.  His Family and friends will memorialize him  during a special service at Temple Beth Am  on Tuesday July, 31 2007.  Kenneth Myers was a dedicated public servant and his leadership in the community was  genuinely admirable. We would all be well  served to emulate the legacy of achievement  that Mr. Myers practiced  throughout his  lifetime. May his memory be blessed.  f  IN HONOR AND MEMORY OF THE  HON.

2185,397,2007-07-31,Mr. BONNER.," Madam Speaker, Mobile  County and,  indeed,  the entire state of Alabama, has lost a dear friend and I rise today  to honor him and pay tribute to his memory.  Mylan Engel, a distinguished  former State  legislator, was a devoted  family man while  spending nearly 50 years of his  life  in  the  arena of public service. Mylan served in both  the Alabama House of Representatives and  the Alabama Senate from 1961 to 1970.  During his career  in  the  legislature, Mr.  Engel was the chairman of the Mobile County  delegation for 4 years and served as the floor  leader under three governors. During this time  and in the years that followed, he also served  as chief attorney for the Mobile County Personnel Board. He never fully retired from practicing law until he suffered a stroke about a  year ago.  While a member of  the Alabama Legislature, Mr. Engel sponsored countless bills that  were later signed into law, but he is perhaps  best known  for his  legislation  to create  the  University of South Alabama in 1963. Mylan  was a member of  the University’s Board of  Trustees from 1963 to 1975, and he stepped  down from the USA Foundation in June.  Mr. Engel grew up on a  farm  in  rural  Summerdale, Alabama, where he developed a  work ethic rooted in his Christian faith and instilled in him by his parents.  Farming became his passion, and he continued to plant and harvest crops throughout his  life. His  family notes  that Mr. Engel was  known for giving away his new potatoes, corn,  beans and watermelons. In addition, Mr. Engel  was a 50-year member of the congregation at  Grace Lutheran Church.  Mr. Engel, a graduate of the University of  Alabama, was  a  distinguished  veteran  of  World War II. He served in the Rhineland and  Central European campaigns.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join  me in remembering a dedicated public servant  and long-time advocate for Mobile and south  Alabama.  Mylan Engel, Sr., will be deeply missed by  his  family—his wife, Rositha Engel; his  four  sons, Mylan R. Engel Jr., Mark Engel, Daniel  Engel, and Tommy Whitman; his two daughters, Carla Meyers and Bonita Engel Amonett;  his  seven  grandsons  and  two  granddaughters—as well as the countless friends he  leaves behind. Our thoughts and prayers are  with them all at this difficult time.

I am delighted to present to my colleagues the wonderful gentleman from  Ypsilanti, the Reverend S.L. Roberson,  and I want to thank him for taking  time to be with us today to act as our  guest chaplain.  He has dedicated his life to the service of his fellow man and is one of the  most beloved and respected pastors and  citizens of the State of Michigan. He  has been pastor of the Metropolitan  Memorial Baptist Church in Ypsilanti  for 53 years. He has served his country  with great distinction as a member of  the United States Marine Corps, of  which he is very proud.  He has undergraduate degrees from  Eastern Michigan University, has studied at Detroit Bible College, and has a  doctorate of divinity from Urban Bible  College so that he may more fully and  better serve his fellow man.  In addition to his civic and spiritual  service, he has worked for Ford Motor  Company for 33 years in their Labor  Relations and Personnel Services of Industrial Relations Department. He has  found time to serve as president of the  Ypsilanti Housing Commission and is  chaplain of the Ypsilanti Police Department.  He is a wonderful individual to provide the opening prayer for the Congress because of his great life experiences and his wonderful service to his  country, including distinguished service in the military. He has given his  fellow citizens over 50 years of spiritual  guidance,  and  he  has  administered  God’s word to civil servants and citizens alike all across Michigan.  I ask my colleagues to welcome this  distinguished  American,  our  guest  chaplain, Rev. S.L. Roberson, and to  welcome his wife and friends who are in  the gallery today.  I thank you, Madam Speaker. We  have before us a man of great respect  and a real cornerstone to his community.  f  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  The SPEAKER.

",2007
2187,1,2007-09-05,Mr. WILSON of Ohio.," Madam Speaker, Democrats are taking a new direction in America. We realize that restoring the American Dream begins with a  great education. Unfortunately, over  the last 6 years affording a 4-year college education has become increasingly  difficult,  especially  for  the middle  class. That is why this Congress is providing the single largest investment in  higher education since the creation of  the GI Bill.  We make college more affordable for  all Americans by reducing the cost of  student loans and increasing the size of  Pell Grants, and we do this all with no  new cost to the taxpayers. Our investment in college students would be paid  for by reducing the excessive Federal  subsidies to the student loan industry.  bThis symbol represents the time of day during the House proceedings, e.g.,b1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typeface indicates words inserted or appended, rather than spoken, by a Member of the House on the floor.

2191,8,2007-09-05,Mr.  FALEOMAVAEGA.,"  Madam  Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  bill and yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Let me first thank our distinguished  chairman of the committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. LANTOS),  and our senior ranking member, the  gentlelady from Florida, for their support and for their leadership in bringing this bill before the floor.  And let me thank our eminent colleague in the other Chamber, the distinguished Senator from Indiana (Senator LUGAR) for his leadership on this  important issue. It is exemplary of his  sage leadership on so many foreign affairs matters.  Madam Speaker, in 1777, while serving the American cause in Paris, Benjamin Franklin discovered a brilliant  Polish military  tactician. His name  was Casimir Pulaski. A leader in Poland’s bitter campaign to beat back  Russia,  the  nobleman Pulaski  sacrificed his status in Europe to join the  American revolution in the New World.  It did not take long for George Washington to recognize the great talent he  had on his hands. He promoted Pulaski  to brigadier general, placing him  in  charge of four horse brigades.  Pulaski’s prowess and strategic skill  during the Revolutionary War became  renowned. So dedicated was he to our  cause  that when  funding  ran  low  among the colonials, he used some of  his own money to purchase equipment  for his men.  General  Pulaski,  who  eventually  went down in the history books as the  father of the American cavalry, is just  one of the many important Polish figures who have contributed greatly to  the United States and to the world.  The relationship between the people of  our two countries has flourished in recent  years  since  the  fall  of  communism, but  it actually dates back  centuries to the founding of our Nation.  Today, this Congress aims to help the  people of Poland rear the next generation of productive, inventive and standout individuals. This bill authorizes an  educational exchange program between  our two nations that promises to be  mutually beneficial and strengthen the  alliance between our two nations.  This program will be identical in its  structure and operation to the successful Congress-Bundestag exchange that  was  launched  in 1983. Over the  last  quarter century, thousands of young  Americans and Germans have seized  the opportunity to spend an academic  year living and studying with their foreign peers.  As a result, these secondary school  students have gained a better understanding of each other’s way of life and  have begun developing into citizens of  the world. With the authorization and  funding of the bilateral initiative before us today, we will extend the same  opportunities to our young friends in  Poland.  Cross-cultural exchange is the most  powerful way  of  creating  harmony  among nations. And study abroad programs  represent  the most  powerful  type of exchange because they foster  understanding  and  education  about  other nations at an early age. The  country of Poland is one of our most  important allies in Europe, has supported us  in our  fight against  terrorism, and stood with us by contributing troops to Afghanistan and Iraq.  The Polish people have made great  strides since the  fall of communism  liberalizing  their  economy,  joining  NATO in 1999, and becoming a Member  of the European Union in 2004.  It is high time that we recognize and  advance Poland’s place in the world, as  well as our special relationship with  that nation, by initiating a robust educational exchange program.  Madam Speaker,  I wholeheartedly  support this proposed bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of Senate bill  377,  the United  States-Poland  Parliamentary  Youth  Exchange Program Act.  This  bill,  introduced  by  Senator  LUGAR, and already passed by the Senate in March, would establish a formal  parliamentary  youth  exchange  program  for American and Polish  secondary students. The purpose of this  exchange program is to demonstrate to  the youth of Poland and to the United  States the benefits of friendly cooperation based on our shared political and  cultural values.  The United States and Poland have  enjoyed close bilateral relations since  the end of the Cold War. Poland has  supported U.S.-led efforts to fight global terrorism, has contributed troops to  coalition  forces  in Afghanistan and  Iraq, and has cooperated closely with  the United States to promote democracy and human  rights around  the  world and to reform the United Nations.  b1100  By focusing on the source of our common future, our young people, this bill  will further cement the friendship and  the ideals that our two nations already  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:00 Sep 06, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A05SE7.002 H05SEPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007
2192,15,2007-09-05,Mrs. CHRISTENSEN.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise in support of H. Res. 508, which recognizes the strong security alliance between the  Government of Japan and the United States  and expresses our country’s appreciation  to  Japan for its role in enhancing stability in the  Asia-Pacific region and also for their efforts in  the global war on terrorism. I commend Mr.  for authoring  this resolution and  for  the support by the leadership to bring this resolution up for our consideration.  On October 29, 2005,  the Government of  the United States and  the Government of  Japan entered into a renewed Security Consultative Agreement that calls for a major realignment  of U.S.-Japan  strategic  alliance.  This agreement continues Japan’s strategic  role for the security of the region in cooperation with  the United States.  In addition,  the  agreement will realign our U.S. forces within  Japan and throughout the Pacific so that the  U.S. is better positioned to respond militarily to  incidents in Asia and the Pacific.  Incidentally, under the agreement, the U.S.  territory of Guam could become the new home  to elements of the 3rd Marine Expeditionary  Force. It is projected that nearly 8,000 active  duty Marines and their dependents will be relocated from Okinawa to Guam.  As you know, Madam Speaker, our U.S. territories fall under the jurisdiction of the House  Natural  Resources  Committee,  specifically  under the Subcommittee on Insular Affairs. As  chairman of  the Subcommittee,  I had  the  unique opportunity to travel to Japan and to  the Pacific over the August recess to convene  a field hearing on Guam on the proposed U.S.  military buildup and the challenges the island’s  community will face due to the impact of relocating so many U.S. forces.  I was impressed by briefings we held with  U.S. Navy ADM William French and U.S. Air  Force BG Douglas Owens. Both were extremely forthright about the strategic value of  Guam in defending our Nation and developing  relationships and  training opportunities with  our allies, including Japan, so that our interests in the Asia-Pacific region are secured. In  fact, while  in Guam, our military was conducting ‘‘Operation Valiant Shield’’ which was  a military exercise between our  forces and  those of our allies in the Pacific and Asia.  I was equally impressed with the patriotism  of the people of Guam and the support they  have shown for the relocation. This is not to  say that there are no concerns throughout the  community on what the impact of Marines will  mean to the services provided to the Government of Guam. Any community would have  concerns on education, healthcare,  law enforcement,  infrastructure, etc.  It  is my hope  that as  the buildup continues,  the Congress  will consider these impacts on the island community and work to mitigate such problems for  the benefit of  the community  ‘‘outside  the  gates.’’  On my return from Guam, I also had the opportunity to meet with officials from the Japanese Defense and Foreign Ministries  to be  briefed on their progress in the realignment of  U.S. Forces in Japan. In addition to meeting  with Deputy Foreign Minister Haneda, we  were informed by the Senior Coordinator for  Japan-U.S. Security Affairs, Keiichi Ono and  the Deputy Director General for Realignment  Initiatives Daikichi Momma and  their  team,  that Japan is moving forward with the things  they need to do to fully implement the realignment and that they would be mindful to take  into account concerns raised about the impact  of the realignment on the territory and people  of Guam.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to express my  appreciation and that of my constituents to the  people of Japan for their continued strong alliance and for their role in enhancing stability in  the Asia-Pacific region and their efforts in the  global war on terrorism. I urge my colleagues  to support adoption of H. Res. 508.  ",2007
2193,15,2007-09-05,Ms. BORDALLO.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today in support of the House Resolution 508,  recognizing  the strong security alliance between  the Government of  Japan and  the  United States and expressing appreciation to  Japan for its role in enhancing stability in the  Asia-Pacific Region and its efforts in the global  war against terrorism.  The Government of Japan, crucial to stabilizing the Asia-Pacific Region, has for decades  served as a cornerstone for U.S. national security posture worldwide. I expect our governments to remain strong allies long into the future. The Government of Japan’s efforts  in  support of the global war against terrorism are  commendable and serve as a superb model  for other governments to emulate.  The people of Guam, who  I  represent  in  Congress, enjoy a robust relationship with the  Japanese people. Many residents on Guam  are of Japanese descent. Also, Guam hosts  over a million Japanese tourists each year and  we  welcome more.  Japanese  companies  make significant investments in Guam’s telecommunications infrastructure and in our tourism  and  hospitality  industry.  Moreover,  Guam’s relationship with the Japanese people  and their government will grow stronger in the  years to come. The Government of Japan will,  in large part, finance the planned re-Iocation  of elements of  the  III Marine Expeditionary  Force from Okinawa to Guam. What is more,  the future military training exercises on and in  the waters around Guam will include greater  numbers of Japanese Self-Defense Force personnel.  I welcome all efforts that strengthen the security  relationship  that exists between  the  United States and the Japan. I strongly support  this  resolution  recognizing  the valuable  security alliance between the Government of  Japan and the United States and expressing  appreciation to Japan for its role in enhancing  stability in the Asia-Pacific Region and its efforts in the global war against terrorism. I urge  my colleagues’ support.  ",2007

RES. 575  Whereas on June 17, 2003, the Hashemite  Kingdom of Jordan held parliamentary elections, the fourth since 1989, and the first during the reign of His Majesty King Abdullah  II;  Whereas His Majesty King Abdullah II has  announced that the next parliamentary elections in Jordan will be held November 20,  2007;  Whereas municipal elections for the local  councils were held on July 31, 2007, under a  new reformed municipal elections law passed  on February 4, 2007, under which the mayors  and councils of all municipalities in Jordan  were elected;  Whereas the new reformed municipal elections law includes a 20 percent quota for  women in the council seats and reduces the  age of eligible voters from 19 to 18 years of  age in order to expand the voter base;  Whereas with the direct assistance of the  United States Agency for International Development and  the Millennium Challenge  Corporation, Jordan has placed great emphasis in recent years on the rights of women to  vote and run for public office, thereby serving as a model for other countries in the region;  Whereas the people and the Government of  Jordan are committed to continuing this  progress;  Whereas His Majesty King Abdullah II recently emphasized the importance of building a thriving civil society when he declared,  ‘‘We in Jordan—and many others, throughout the Middle East—are working hard to  create a civic environment in which our people will thrive. The basic requirement is an  inclusive, democratic civil society—one that  guarantees rights, delegates responsibilities,  honors merit and rewards achievement. The  foundation stones on which we build are  peace and stability, basic civil and political  rights, essential services, freedom of expression and the rule of law.’’; and  Whereas Jordan continues to invest in reforming  its educational  system  to  incorporate  democratic  values  and  principles:  Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the House of Representatives—  (1) commends the people, the Government  of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan , and  His Majesty King Abdullah II for their decision to conduct municipal and parliamentary  elections in 2007;  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:45 Sep 06, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K05SE7.026 H05SEPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

2201,22,2007-09-05,Mr. MORAN  of  Kansas.," Madam  Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Georgia for yielding me the time, and I  am here to lend my support for the  gentleman from Kansas’ efforts in regard to once again disaster striking  our State.  We come from a State, Mr. TIAHRT  and I and the rest of the Members of  the Kansas congressional delegation,  that  really has known  tough  times  over a  long history. But especially  within  the  last  few months,  really  within the last year, Kansas has had  winter storms that involved hail and  freezing rain, ice, snow, as well as tornados. Greensburg, Kansas, became a  national  location, known by people  around the world for a tornado that destroyed an entire town, and now most  recently a large portion of our State  has been struck by tremendous rainfall  resulting in flooding.  I appreciate the gentleman from Kansas’ (Mr. TIAHRT) leadership in bringing  attention to this plight that we face in  our State.  In fact, there are 69 counties in the  First Congressional District. All but  four of them have been declared natural disaster areas this year, since January 1 by the President, and FEMA and  other  emergency  responders  are  at  work.  The  encouraging  thing  about  our  State is that local folks respond, and  we’ve seen tremendous efforts by individual citizens from across the State  arriving to help their neighbors, and  we’ve seen the collection plates passed  on  Sunday morning, money  being  raised, response being had, and we’ve  had tremendous support from our law  enforcement  community,  from  our  emergency preparedness officials, as  well as State and Federal officials. In  many instances, I would report that  FEMA has responded in a very noble  and  adequate way,  and we’re  very  grateful for that help.  Again, all the disaster has caused  many Members of Congress to stop and  talk to us from Kansas and wish us  well. We’ve had encouragement and  support from leaders around the world,  in fact, due to the tremendous natural  disasters that have occurred.  And so I’m here to express my support for Mr. TIAHRT’s efforts and let  him know that we all care about the  portion of the State that has now been  affected by these floods and will work  closely with him, following his leadership to see that the response is appropriate  from the Federal Government  and that Kansans once again rebound  from this significant natural disaster.  I, too, would like to commend Coffeyville Resources for their response. It’s  caused  significant  losses within  the  community of Coffeyville. It’s also had  a consequence upon all Kansans. It’s  one of our three refineries, and so gas  and diesel prices have been affected as  a result of the closing, at least temporarily, of a refinery in our State. But  their responses, both in getting back  into business and  their  response  to  being a good corporate citizen within  the community of Coffeyville, should  be recognized.  And finally, I thank the support we  have had from my colleagues here in  the United States House of Representatives. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",2007

2205,22,2007-09-05,Mr. MOORE of Kansas.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today in support of H. Res. 544, recognizing the victims of floods in Kansas.  On June 26, a storm brought several days  of torrential rainfall to Kansas, leading to major  damage,  including  the destruction of 3,100  homes and businesses, and even more tragically, one person’s death.  Within a 4 day period, some communities  received 21 inches of rain. Communities in 20  counties were evacuated.  This  resolution simply expresses heartfelt  sympathy for the victims of these devastating  thunderstorms, in addition to conveying gratitude to the local, State, and Federal officials  and  emergency  personnel who  responded  swiftly to the crisis, including the Kansas National Guard and Kansas Highway Patrol and  recognizing  the generous support of volunteers, private and corporate donors, religious  groups, and charitable organizations that have  given generously toward the relief efforts following the destructive flooding.  Most importantly, this resolution commends  the spirit of the people of Kansas, who consistently demonstrate their strength, not only in  rebuilding their own lives in the face of adversity and hardship, but also through their outpouring of compassionate care for neighbors.  ‘‘Ad  astra  per  aspera,’’  is  our Kansas  motto—‘‘to the stars through difficulties.’’  I urge my colleagues  to support H. Res.  544, acknowledging the destruction left behind  by recent severe weather in Kansas, yet celebrating the resilience of the Kansans rebuilding homes, businesses, lives, and dreams.  ",2007

And it is so good to know that  there  is  somebody  like Cal Ripken  around, somebody who does not mind  accepting the role as a role model and  being just that.  So many young people look up to  sports figures, and they try to emulate  them. All you have to do is go to a  baseball game and you will see them  with the jerseys on with names of players on the back. And if you go to Memorial Stadium,  now  called Oriole  Park, you will see a lot of jerseys with  little kids, trying to dream the Cal  Ripken dream, with his name on their  backs.

He exhibited  the utmost in professionalism and sportsmanship in every aspect of his life.  Cal Ripken, Jr. was known to many as the  ‘‘Iron Man’’  for  tirelessly overcoming many  minor injuries to always be in the lineup for his  team and for the fans. He took the field for the  Baltimore Orioles on May 30, 1982 and did  not miss a game until September 19, 1998.  On September 6, 1995, millions of fans worldwide tuned in to watch Cal Ripken, Jr. surpass  Lou Gehrig for the most consecutive games  played, at 2,131 games. He ended his streak  having played in 2,632 consecutive games.  By  the  time he  retired  from professional  baseball,  in October 2001, Cal Ripken had  played 21 seasons with the Baltimore Orioles.  During that time, Mr. Ripken had broken the  team’s  record  for career games played, at  bats,  runs, hits, doubles, homeruns, RBIs,  total bases, and walks. He  is a member of  Major League Baseball’s exclusive 3,000 hit  club.  Cal Ripken stuck with his team through the  good years and the bad years with a level of  professionalism rare in sports today. He was a  favorite among fans and holds the record for  most All-Star votes  received by any single  player. He was voted to play in the All-Star  game 19 times, and won the game’s Most Valuable Player, MVP, honor twice. On Thursday,  July 26, 2007, Cal Ripken, Jr. was inducted  into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame  in Cooperstown, NY, with  the  third highest  percentage of votes ever received.  After  his  storied  baseball  career,  Cal  Ripken, Jr. continues to make a difference in  his community an across the country. Along  with his brother Billy, he  formed  the Cal  Ripken, Sr. Foundation to give underprivileged  children  the opportunity  to attend baseball  camps around the country and to learn his beloved game.

2226,43,2007-09-05,Mr. LATOURETTE.," Mr. Speaker, I  want to thank the dean of our delegation  for authoring this resolution. I  also want to thank our Democratic  friends from Ohio and Members from  other States who I see gathering on the  floor.  Mr. Speaker, there is no way to describe today’s news about our friend,  PAULGILLMOR, other than shock, a  devastating loss to his family, to his  friends, his colleagues, Ohio and our  Nation.  Unlike a number of the other members of the Ohio delegation, I didn’t  come to Congress through the Ohio legislature, and so  I didn’t serve with  PAUL in the Ohio legislature, although  I knew of him from Republican gatherings around the State of Ohio, he  also was my mom’s Congressman. She  always told me the story about how excited the people were who were up in  Lakeside, Marblehead and the Islands  that Congressman GILLMORwas going  to come up and share his thoughts. But  I didn’t have the chance to work with  him until I arrived here about 13 years  ago. What  I  found was what  I had  heard, and that was that Congressman  GILLMORwas a hardworking, smart legislator who loved his family, loved his  friends, loved this institution and the  people he served. He was willing to  take the time to show a young freshman around back in 1995. He was willing to share his vast knowledge of financial services with those that didn’t  quite have the same expertise. If you  were having a sadness or a joy in your  life, he was willing to share in that.  And he was a wonderful fellow to sit  and have dinner with. And after dinner,  PAUL GILLMOR.  he was a wonderful fellow to sit around  with and tell war stories. And over the  course of the years, many of those stories were exaggerated with the passage  of time and also the failing of memory,  but it was always a good time.  I was reminded by my staff, because  I want to talk about PAUL’s family, but  I also want to talk about PAUL’s other  family. And my staff reminded me,  when they learned of PAUL’s passing  today, that we were neighbors in the  Longworth Building, and my staff told  me how lucky we were to have a neighbor whose staff was always willing to  walk us through another clueless day  in the 104th Congress. And how you  could always walk into the lobby, and  how he taught us about constituent  services because you would always find  a bowl of Dum Dum suckers because  the Spangler Candy Company was located in Bryan, Ohio, which was in the  Congressman’s district.  Our Ohio delegation  is poor today  with the loss of our friend, neighbor  and mentor,  Our  thoughts and prayers are with PAUL’s  wife, Karen, his  five wonderful children, and also, Mr. Speaker, with his  Capitol Hill  family, many of whom  have been with him for many, many  years and who miss him very badly  today.

2228,43,2007-09-05,Ms. SUTTON.," Mr. Speaker,  I was  deeply saddened today to hear of the  passing of Congressman PAULGILLMOR.  As a freshman Member of this body,  I haven’t known Mr. GILLMORas long  as some of my colleagues who have already spoken and who will, I’m sure,  rise to speak in moments following my  remarks.  I did have occasion enough to spend  time with Mr. GILLMORto know what a  friendly and unpretentious and  likeable man he was. And my thoughts and  prayers are with his wife, Karen, and  his family and his friends. I did have  the opportunity to serve with Karen in  the State  legislature  in Ohio. And  Karen, as I said, you’re in our thoughts  and prayers.  The State of Ohio and the United  States Congress  have  lost  a  great  friend. PAULGILLMORdevoted his life  to serving his community, his State  and his Nation. From his service in the  United States Air Force to his tireless  efforts on behalf of the people of Ohio  in Congress, PAUL always  fought hard to make a difference in  people’s  lives. We will all miss him  greatly. And I am grateful for the opportunity to have known him even for  the short time that I did.  ",2007
2229,43,2007-09-05,Mr. REGULA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  21⁄2minutes  to  the gentleman  from  Texas (Mr. BARTON), chairman of the  committee on which PAULserved.  ",2007
2230,43,2007-09-05,Mr. BARTON of Texas.," Well,  the  former chairman, the ranking member  now.  GILLMOR When I think of PAULGILLMOR, I  think of two words,  ‘‘team player.’’  Earlier  this year, when  the Republicans  lost the majority, we had to  downsize the number of Republicans on  the Energy and Commerce Committee,  and I made a decision, as the ranking  member, to try not to have to kick  anybody off the committee and not  bump off our  junior members. So  I  went to the senior members of the  committee and asked if there were any  volunteers who might want to take a  leave of absence to allow the junior  members not to have to be bumped off,  and of course PAULGILLMORwas one of  the ones who volunteered to take a  leave of absence so he could serve on  the Financial Services Committee and  keep his seniority on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.  b1545  Because of that, several of our junior  members were able to stay on the committee.  Well, about a month ago, we had a  contentious mark-up coming up. Sure  enough, one of the junior members had  a personal family situation that they  couldn’t get out of. They were going to  have to take a leave of absence. We  needed every vote. So I went to PAUL,  and I said, ‘‘Would you be willing to  come back on the committee for 1 or 2  days?’’ He kind of grumped a little bit  about it, but he said, ‘‘If you need me,  I’ll be there.’’ Not only did he come  back on the committee, but he offered  amendments and was there all of the  time and didn’t complain, whine, moan  or groan about how tough it was. He  was a team player. He did a good job.  When we were in the majority, PAUL  was the chairman of the Subcommittee  on Environment and Hazardous Materials, which  is not one of the more  glamorous subcommittees of this Congress. It deals with such things as the  Superfund and the Clean Water Act and  all these international treaties. It’s a  tough job. PAULdid it not only with  good grace, but he did it in an excellent  fashion.  PAULGILLMOR is going to be missed  as a friend. He is going to be missed as  a Congressman. He  is going  to be  missed as a statesman for this country.  My sympathy goes out to his wife,  Karen, and his family. We will definitely miss the services of the Honorin the House of  able PAULGILLMOR Representatives.  God bless him, and God bless his family.  ",2007

2236,50,2007-09-05,Mr. MCGOVERN.," Mr. Speaker, there  is a great deal of spin coming from the  White House on why America needs to  stay the course in Iraq, and why we  must keep the surge going on and on  and on, on how victory is near if we  simply escalate the number of troops  we have in this region of Iraq or another region of Iraq.  Enough, Mr. Speaker,  enough.  It  seems the President hasn’t read his  own National Intelligence Estimate on  Iraq. If he had, he would find a grim  picture of the political and security reality in Iraq, one quite different from  his own.  Let me read just a few conclusions  from this August 23 report:  One, the level of overall violence, including  attacks  on  and  casualties  among civilians, remains high; Iraq’s  sectarian groups remain unreconciled;  al Qaeda in Iraq retains the ability to  conduct high-profile attacks; and to  date, Iraqi political leaders remain unable to govern effectively.  Two, population displacement resulting from sectarian violence continues,  imposing burdens on provincial governments and some neighboring states and  increasing the danger of destabilizing  influences spreading across Iraq’s borders over the next 6 to 12 months.  Three,  broadly  accepted  political  compromises required for sustained security, long-term political progress and  economic development are unlikely to  emerge unless there is a fundamental  shift in the factors driving Iraqi political and security developments.  Mr. Speaker, just the first few pages  of the NIE on Iraq should concern everyone. Also on the President’s reading  list should be the August 30 draft GAO  report on Iraq, which also paints a very  pessimistic picture of  Iraq.  It  concludes that Iraq has failed to meet all  but three of the 18 required benchmarks  for  political  and military  progress. Rather than embrace these  nonpartisan findings, the White House  has actually denounced the GAO report  for holding Iraq to too high a set of  standards.  Mr. Speaker, while the White House  speaks of how violence has been reduced in Baghdad, it ignores how the  number of Iraqi civilian deaths across  the country rose by about 20 percent in  July. This is not the time to paint rosy  scenarios and declare victory  is at  hand if only Congress coughs up another $200 billion to cover the costs of  the war over the next few months.  Mr. Speaker, the President and we in  Congress must face the facts. We need  a plan on how to leave Iraq in a safe  and orderly manner in 2008. We need  the President to meet with congressional leaders and map out a concrete  plan for how to draw down our forces  and leave Iraq over the next 9 to 12  months. It can be done, and it must be  done.  We can redeploy troops to Kuwait in  the surrounding region. We can safeguard the Kurdish north. We can redeploy troops to Afghanistan. And we can  bring troops home to their  families,  friends and communities. We need the  Pentagon to provide a realistic plan for  withdrawal, one  that  is  logistically  sound and can be achieved over the  next year.  President Bush, with great fanfare,  recently invoked the Vietnam analogy  to support our continued escalation in  Iraq. If anything, Vietnam and Iraq  prove that wars are a lot easier to get  into than out of. If we want to avoid  the haste, confusion and humiliation of  our final departure from Vietnam, a  withdrawal that occurred almost entirely without planning and hurt U.S.  military prestige more than any other  single action, then we must plan now  for our departure from Iraq. If we fail  to plan and control the safe and orderly withdrawal of our forces, then we  will surely fail our troops once again,  holding them hostage to events on the  ground beyond their control.  The administration lacked a plan for  what to do in Iraq the day after the fall  of Saddam Hussein. We must not repeat that mistake when it comes to the  welfare and the safety of our troops as  they leave Iraq.  For far too long, Congress failed to  live up to its responsibilities. We must  not continue to send blank checks to  the White House.  Mr. Speaker, this House should not  consider the President’s supplemental  request until we come to an agreement  with him on how to bring our troops  home in a safe, orderly and timely way.  Let me be clear. This means we  should not consider on the floor of this  House any additional funding for this  war until we have a plan to end it.  As The New York Times stated last  Friday, ‘‘In Vietnam, like Iraq, American Presidents and military  leaders  went to great lengths to pretend that  victory was at hand when nothing  could be further from the truth.’’  We don’t need more spin, Mr. Speaker. What we need is a plan to end the  war in Iraq, and we need it now.  f  REPORT  ON  RESOLUTION  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF  H.R.  2786,  NATIVE  AMERICAN  HOUSING  ASSISTANCE  AND  SELF-DETERMINATION  REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007  Mr. McGOVERN,  from  the  Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept.

",2007
2237,50,2007-09-05,Mr. POE.," Mr. Speaker,  ‘‘Wherever  there is a Mexican, there is Mexico.  Mexico does not end at our borders.’’  To the roar of a standing ovation, the  arrogant saber-rattling words are from  Mexico’s President Calderon in his first  state of the union message.  It seems clear to me that these aggressive words are a renewed call by  Mexico to colonize the United States.  Does El Presidente Calderon claim that  the southwest United States is really  part of Mexico since many illegals have  colonized that area? Sounds like it to  me.  Is Leader Calderon calling for a continued stealth invasion into the United  States by its citizens? Sounds like it to  me.  Does  clever  calculating  Calderon  want the United States to become a  union with Mexico? Time will tell.  Meanwhile,  I wonder  if anyone  in  charge of protecting our homeland is  aware of and disturbed by these indignant words. In the history of nations,  it appears that when one country invades, colonizes, infiltrates or occupies  another without permission,  the  invaded country either resists invasion  at the border or just loses its existence.  Time will tell what the United States  will do.  And that’s just the way it is.

2238,57,2007-09-05,Mr. WALZ of Minnesota.," The gentleman’s point, one of the things that is  very well taken is that the genius of  our system lies in the system of checks  and balances, the oversight that should  have been provided. Now, those of us  who were expressing grave misgivings  about the President’s plan to basically  simply trust him that he had a plan for  Iraq, to trust him that he had a plan on  this, and any of us who spoke out and  said,  the  responsibility  for enacting  foreign policy  lies between the Congress and the President, carrying out  the military side of it will always be  done with great professionalism.  But as we ask the questions, what is  the step beyond the military? What is  the  step  for political gain  in  Iraq?  What is the bigger picture, the geopolitical picture, of the Middle East?  When we started asking those questions for 3 years prior to this Congress  coming, we were told we were unpatriotic,  that we were  somehow undermining  the  troops. Forget  that we  funded them in terms of the VA and everything else at a historic level once  we got here. We were told that. This  oversight and this ability to check the  executive branch is exactly what the  American people are looking at.  I stress it and say it again. I do not  believe that the American public were  enamored  strictly with Democratic  ideology. But I can tell you what they  were disgusted with; the belief of the  sense of righteousness that was coming  that there could be no room for debate,  there was no  room  to compromise,  there was no room to listen to the experts, and there was no reason to back  off and say, ‘‘Perhaps we were wrong.’’  That’s what we heard. That’s what we  heard for 6 years from this administration. That’s what we heard with a Congress that provided this President no  reason to veto. None. Zero. Why should  he? They were writing the legislation.  The President has been using the word  ‘‘veto’’ in almost every sentence since  we came here. That tells me the system is working beautifully. That tells  me that the system is providing those  checks and balances.  In this idea of oversight, there are a  couple of important pieces of legislation that I would like to bring up and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:00 Sep 06, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K05SE7.116 H05SEPT1 E S U O H M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007
2239,64,2007-09-05,Mr. WAMP.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman  for her  service  to  the  Commonwealth of Virginia and to this  great Nation of ours on the Armed  Services Committee and for going and  bringing us that unique insight.  As I prepare to yield to the gentleman  from Georgia,  let me  say  I  think part of the equation for the Congress in a responsible, objective way in  the days ahead is to remember that  this is not all about Iraq. It is about  the  bigger  picture with  the  global  threat of the jihadists, the most radical elements of Islam, and the way  that they are spreading their influence  around the world outside even of the  Middle East. I think we have to really  understand  that  to know what  the  stakes are associated with the precipitous withdrawal or anything that  is  perceived to be a retreat.  These are real problems. It’s easy to  say, oh, George Bush got us into this  war with flawed intelligence. It’s also  easy to forget that over half of the  Democrats in the United States Senate  voted to remove Saddam Hussein by  force and almost half the Democrats in  the House of Representatives voted to  remove Saddam Hussein by force based  on the very same knowledge and understanding that the executive branch had  about what the threats were, and we  made that decision as Americans.  It is really unfortunate today that  decisions and responsibility for those  decisions now end up being peeled off  as partisan  issues  instead of, we do  these  things  together, we  stand  together, we stand behind our troops together, we stand behind their mission  together.  We had Members like RALPHHALLof  Texas come back and say to a person  the men and women in uniform told  him while he was there that we should  stay and finish what we started and not  leave until we can successfully complete this mission. And you say, well,  what is that and when will we know?  Objectively, you’re getting that report  and it’s much more positive than it  was, and the stakes for leaving are incredibly high.  If you don’t believe the influence of  the radical Islamists around the world,  I would encourage you to read Mark  Steyn’s book, ‘‘America Alone,’’ where  he lays out what’s happened in Europe  and  the  influence with  the  global  sharia, which is a call to Islamic law,  and the intimidation and the threat  around the world, or even this new  book called ‘‘Alms for Jihad: Charity  and Terrorism in the Islamic World,’’  by J. Miller Burke. He wrote this book  exposing the connection between the  Saudi  royal  family  and  terrorism  through these charities that they set  up and funnel money.  It reminded me of the Oil-for-Food  scandal at the United States where  Saddam Hussein corrupted the United  Nations.  b1845  All of  the  corruption  that  exists  through  this  radical  effort, because  this book that lays all this out can’t be  bought today. It has vanished from all  of the Amazons. It has vanished from  the availability of Barnes & Noble to  find the book. What happened to it?  Well,  through  intimidation  and  money, they have taken this information out of circulation so the people  can’t see these connections.  They  literally  tie him,  this man,  Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz,  to  the  charity that he set up to  fund bin  Laden with Saudi royal family money,  and  then when  they  published  the  book, it vanished. You can’t get it. You  can’t go buy it.  Mark Steyn lays out, this is the kind  of work that the radical Wahabi sect,  the al Qaeda operatives, are doing in  the world. They have infiltrated and  corrupted, and we are like boiling frogs  if we deny any longer how this threat  is overtaking the free world. America  Alone’s premise is they’ve already got  Europe and frankly Australia is really  the only nation standing with us like  they need to.  This is a growing global imminent  threat. If we pull out, it will rapidly  deteriorate  in the world. Our credibility will be lost for generations. We  may never regain  it. Those are the  stakes. That’s bigger than Iraq. Iraq is  one chapter in this long-term gener-  ational struggle for our freedom. The  sooner we realize it, the better we are.  I went and spoke to kids in schools in  August, and they asked the question  about,  well,  Afghanistan  and  the  Taliban attacked us, but Saddam Hussein in Iraq didn’t attack us. Why did  we go there?  The  lesson of history  is Germany  didn’t attack us,  either. Japan attacked us. Germany didn’t attack us.  But did we ignore the threat of Nazi  Germany? No. Our men stormed the  beaches of Omaha and liberated Normandy and Omaha Beach, and liberated  Europe, so that our way of life could be  DRAKE,  preserved. Sometimes they forget that,  but that’s American leadership. This is  very, very similar to that.  Are we going to exert it in a world in  what this editorial calls the caldron,  you know, of the worst political and religious pathology in the history of the  world in the Middle East? This is the  central stage. We cannot retreat from  this without us really, really taking a  global hit.  The next president is going to inherit  the responsibility of doing this, of carrying this forward.  I want to yield to the statesman from  Georgia, a physician, a healer, a man  with a great heart but a strong back,  also a member of the Armed Services  Committee, Dr. PHILGINGREY.  ",2007
2240,64,2007-09-05,Mr. GINGREY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my colleague  from Tennessee, ZACH  WAMP, for, first of all, conducting this  special order hour, leadership hour on  the Republican side, and for allowing  me and my colleague and great friend  from Virginia, THELMA for  being part of that. DOUGLAMBORN, the  gentleman from Colorado, I think, has  joined us.  Mr. Speaker, I was on the trip with  THELMADRAKE from Virginia when we  visited Iraq and Afghanistan, and I am  not going to repeat everything that she  said, but I want my colleagues to know  that this was my fourth trip to Iraq,  my first opportunity to go to Afghanistan.  But this was a necessity that I go  this fourth time. I think some 40 or 50  Members of the Congress during the so-  called August recess spent 5 to 7 days  in the Middle East and the combat zone  in 120-degree weather.  Those of us on the Armed Services  Committee, I am sure, felt duty bound  to do this, particularly as we approach  the report from General Petraeus and  Ambassador Crocker that’s going to be  delivered to the House on next Monday,  September 10.  I have been four times, but this was  the most meaningful visit, because I  came to a realization, really, actually,  it emboldened my feeling that we need  to give victory a chance. Again, I want  to thank ZACHWAMP, the gentleman  from Tennessee, for the passion that he  brings to this issue. I thought he was  just an expert on energy, but he is also  an expert on national defense, more  important, the global war on terror, as  he so passionately explains this issue.

2255,92,2007-09-05,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, in Iraq  and Afghanistan,  like so many conflicts before, our servicemembers have  done absolutely everything that has  been asked of them. They have answered the President’s call to war with  honor and a sense of duty we have  come to expect from our Nation’s bravest men and women. They have performed under enormous pressure in the  middle of a civil war, they have left behind loved ones who count on them,  and they have continued to put their  lives on the line every day.  Unfortunately, at home, their commitment to service has not been met  yet by an administration that is committed to care for them. From poor  conditions at VA facilities around the  country, lack of PTSD counselors, benefits claims backlogs that keep our  veterans  waiting  for months  and  The  to  months and months and  sometimes  years, it is very clear that so far this  administration has  failed to account  for our Nation’s veterans and to count  them as a cost of this war. It is unacceptable  that  servicemembers  who  fought overseas are  returning home  and being  forced to  fight their own  Government for the care and services  they need.  Today, with the bill that is in front  of us, the VA bill, we take a major step  toward reversing that trend and the  Bush administration’s failure to care  for our heroes. The funding for our veterans included in the VA bill is more  than $3.6 billion over the President’s  request. After years of cutting corners  on caring for our heroes, we are finally  putting forth an honest assessment of  what these men and women need.  This bill takes into account the additional strains on the VA system that  simultaneous wars and new battlefield  realities present. It is an investment  that represents nearly all of the independent  budget, which  is  the  recommendation of the funds needed to  care for our veterans and is compiled  by our veterans service organization.  This bill invests in improving health  care, expanding mental health services,  and constructing new  facilities that  are really needed. It is going to mean,  when this bill is passed and signed by  the President, more qualified health  care workers, better prosthetics that  our servicemembers are asking for, and  more accessible veterans facilities. It  is also going to mean,  importantly,  thousands of new VA case workers who  will help us reduce that unacceptable  delay that we have heard about from so  many of our veterans when they come  home and try to access their benefits.  It will improve conditions at our VA  facilities. It will add an increased investment  in polytrauma and mental  health care  facilities that will drastically  improve treatment  for PTSD  and traumatic brain injury and catastrophic injuries as well. Most of all,  this bill means after years of neglect  our Government  is  again  going  to  honor our veterans’ sacrifices.  This bill and all it provides could not  come at a more crucial time. As a  member myself of both the appropriations subcommittee that is responsible  for this bill and the Senate Veterans’  Affairs Committee, I have heard numerous times firsthand about the VA’s  shortcomings  in caring  for our veterans. In fact, last month on the August break I held a Senate Veterans’  Affairs field hearing in Takoma, WA,  to specifically examine the challenges  that men and women are facing when  they come home. At that hearing I  spoke with Brandon Jacobs. He is a  veteran of  the Army and National  Guard, and he served in Iraq. He said a  lot more has to be done to raise awareness of post-traumatic stress syndrome  and combat-related stresses. He talked  about how we needed to not only increase access for him and his fellow  servicemembers, but also for the families that struggle when a loved one returns home with an invisible wound.  I also heard from a young man, Dan  Purcell. He is an Iraq veteran who said  he didn’t ‘‘want to be treated as a tool  that could be casually discarded when  broken or found to be no longer useful.’’ What a tragic statement  from  someone who served us overseas, that  when he comes home he feels like a discarded tool because he has been broken. That  is not how we should be  treating our veterans, and that is not  how this VA/HUD bill treats our veterans.  This bill that  is before us  finally  takes the important steps that are necessary to recognize Brandon and Dan  and so many others who are part of the  costs of this war. We also have to make  sure our troops are ready and that they  receive the training they need before  we  send  them overseas.  I am very  pleased that within this bill, the military construction investments that are  made will help our country do a better  job in training the men and women we  asked to serve us in our military. In  my home State of Washington, our  military facilities play a very important role in our Nation’s security. We  have Fort Lewis in Tacoma, where we  are training the Stryker Brigades at  the center of the fighting in Iraq, we  have Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane that plays a major role in our air  defense, and we have the Naval Air  Station Whidbey Island that helps patrol the Pacific shores. It is extremely  critical that these bases, which serve  such vital roles, receive the  funding  they need.  The bill that is in front of us today  does just that and provides more than  $635 million in improvements for Washington State military installations. I  thank Senators REED for their special attention and recognition of the needs of our bases in my  home State of Washington and across  the country. Their leadership on this  bill has been outstanding.  I know the chair and ranking member will be on the Senate floor throughout today. The leader has told us that  he wants  this bill  finished by  this  evening. I urge all Members who have  any amendments to come this afternoon to get their amendments offered  because we do have to wrap up this bill.  We are very aware of the timelines  that are approaching, the very short  amount of time that is left to get our  numerous appropriations bills through.  We intend to move them through. In  order to do that we ask Members to  come to the  floor today, offer their  amendments, let’s work through them  and get this bill passed so we can get it  sent to the President.  It is important to pass this bill because this bill recognizes that any time  we invest in building our military and  improving training for our troops we  invest in their care.

2256,99,2007-09-05,Mr. HARKIN.," Lastly, Mr. COBURN  spoke on the floor and mentioned his  staff had made suggestions about the  language. Again, I am very surprised to  hear this. Staff  from my office and  Senator GRASSLEY’s office met with  Senator COBURN’s staff before the recess in an attempt to resolve any differences.  Their staff made no suggestion as to  what  it would take to  lift Senator  COBURN’s hold. Over recess, I instructed  my staff to make attempts to meet  with his staff, but his staff was always  unavailable. Over the last few days, we  once again attempted to reach out to  his staff in an effort to move the bill.  But, again, we have not heard anything  back.  We suggested we would be willing to  work with Senator COBURN on  the  tracking  language he was concerned  about. But we have not heard anything  from his office until the Senator spoke  on the floor this morning.  This bill has received full consideration, as I said, in the House and the  Senate. It passed without a single dissenting voice in the House. Is the Senator from Oklahoma saying there are  423 totally irresponsible people in the  House? I mean, there are people in the  House every bit as conservative as the  Senator from Oklahoma. They did not  raise any objections to this. We had  three hearings in the Senate on the  bill, two hearings in the House.  Josh Omvig’s parents testified before  the Senate VA Committee in April. I  wish to recount something they said.  At the beginning of my remarks,  I  mentioned that Joshua Omvig, before  he went into the military, had been a  member of the Grundy Center Volunteer Fire Department and Police Reserve.  He had hoped to return to serve his  community as a police officer. I said:  Remember that, because I am going to  return to it. I now return to it.  It was his dream to one day become  a police officer. As he pursued that  dream,  he worked  alongside many  Grundy Center  fire  and  policemen.  Here is what Mr. Omvig said to the  committee:  The day after Josh’s suicide, the Grundy  Center police department and fire department had a time where a professional counselor was brought in to help them cope and  deal with what happened that day. Do we as  a nation take the same measures for our  troops who have served for us for months in  a combat area? Are we providing our military men and women the appropriate services to help them assimilate to civilian life?  Are we providing them with what they need  to survive the peace? Ellen and I have to say  ‘‘No’’ not at this time. We can and must do  more!  Now, I saw Joshua’s parents at the  time when they were here  in Washington. And, you know, it is always  awkward to talk to parents about the  death of any of their children, especially a young person taking his own  life. I said to both the parents: Was  there any indication? I mean, do you  have any idea why Joshua would take  his own life?  Mr. Omvig said: Yeah, I know exactly  why. I said: Why? He said: Well, Joshua  always wanted to be a police officer, all  his life growing up. That is why he volunteered on the police reserves, volunteer  fire. He went  into  the  service  thinking that would help him to become a police officer. He was worried  that if he sought mental health services, he would never be able to become  a police officer. What a shame. What a  shame that  in this country we still  treat mental health like that. That is  why we have to do a better job.

2259,106,2007-09-05,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President,  I  rise to first of all say I am sure I am  going to be supporting this underlying  bill; military construction  is such a  critical component of our overall defense programs. But there is a collateral issue I would like to address for a  minute. I, first of all, ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the RECORD  an article from the Moody Air Force  Base newspaper from February 1 of this  year.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Air Force Print News Today, Feb.  1, 2007]  MOODYOPENSDOORSTONEWHOUSING  (By Tech. Sgt. Parker Gyokeres)  MOODYAIRFORCEBASE, GA.—Team Moody  celebrated the completion of the first new  single family housing units with a ribbon  cutting ceremony Jan. 31, at the new Magnolia Grove Housing area.  The $52 million project provides 383 three  and four-bedroom homes in Magnolia Grove,  each with no less than 1,630 square feet of  space.  Dignitaries attending the ribbon cutting  ceremony included Maj. Gen. Del Eulberg,  Air Force Civil Engineer, Col. Joe Callahan,  23rd Wing commander, and leadership from  American Eagle Communities LLC.  ‘‘This is a big day for the Airmen and families of Team Moody,’’ said Colonel Callahan.  ‘‘The Magnolia Grove homes are the nicest  base housing units I have ever seen in the 31  years I have been living in base housing.  Moody Family Housing has created a community that any Airman would be proud to  live in.’’ Moody Family Housing is a 50-year,  joint  public-private  partnership  between  American Eagle Communities and the U.S.  Air Force.  ‘‘The partnership is intended to improve  standards of living for current and future  base housing residents,’’ said Louis Screws,  23rd Civil Engineer Squadron housing flight  chief.  The homes are fully owned and maintained  by American Eagle under rules agreed to in  the project’s transaction documents.  ‘‘The Air Force benefits because they receive quality new housing without the up-  front money a military construction contract requires,’’ said Mr. Screws. ‘‘American  Eagle can use private sector financing and  private resources to build these homes faster, better and more economically using local  codes and standards.’’  The units are built with an all-metal framing system that arrives partially assembled  in a kit for a single home. It takes only four  days for a team of eight workers to frame an  entire house,  said Rich Safranic, Moody  Family Housing quality assurance director.  By using all-metal construction, the materials are less expensive to transport, stronger than wood, will not burn and can be recycled easily, said Mr. Safranic.  American Eagle plans to use this construction technique for every home in Magnolia  Grove, and with an average of five homes a  week arriving at the site, every time-saving  measure is essential, added the quality assurance inspector.  Moody Family Housing expects to hand  over an average of one house a day to Air  Force  inspectors  for  certification,  said  Naomi Hendricks, Moody Family Housing  project director. The construction on Magnolia Grove housing is scheduled to be completed this December.  The first residents of Magnolia Grove will  be the 94 families currently residing in the  ‘‘Courts’’  townhouses of  the Quiet Pines  housing area.These units are scheduled to be  demolished as the residents are relocated.  MFH will then use the land for new senior  leadership housing, said Mr. Screws.  American Eagle purchased 700 acres of peanut  farmland along the southern edge of  Moody. There will be 383 single-family units  built on  150 acres of  this property. The  American Eagle Communities has permanently donated approximately 200 acres to  the Banks Lake Wildlife Refuge Area. The  remaining 350 acres are being set aside for  future base-housing growth.  ‘‘We are the first major installation to accomplish the goal of creating a new community using  a  privatized  partnership  like  this,’’ said Lowell Klepper, 23rd CES deputy  base civil engineer. ‘‘Moody has been working towards this point  for more than 20  years.’’  ",2007
2260,106,2007-09-05,Mr. CHAMBLISS.,"  I note  for  the  record that after 4 years of work on a  housing privatization contract and the  millions  spent,  exactly  two  houses  have been built. This article  talks  about a celebration at Moody Air Force  base upon the completion of these two  homes. The problem is, neither one of  these two houses has ever been occupied, and  the privatization  issue at  Moody has developed into a real mess.  The Air Force entered into a real estate transaction with Carabetta Enterprises Inc.  for privatized housing at  Moody Air Force Base. The estimated  cost of the project has exceeded available funding by $25 million, and the  project  lender  stopped  funding  in  March of 2007 to prevent all funds from  being expended. At least three other  Air Force bases—Patrick Air Force  base in Florida, Little Rock Air Force  base  in Arkansas, and Hanscom Air  Force  base  in Massachusetts—have  similar  contracting  delays  with  privatized housing projects associated  with this same contractor.  Despite having declared bankruptcy  in the 1990s and supposedly being embroiled in a series of previous lawsuits  over  Government  contracts,  the  Carabetta organization was allowed to  form a new  joint entity, American  Eagle Communities LLC, and has won  Government contracts  in  five States  for a total $3.3 billion. American Eagle  won the $50 million contract for the  Moody Air Force Base Magnolia Grove  privatized housing project, hired one of  its principals to be the general contractor, and now has  left dozens of  local  subcontractors  unpaid  for  months, resulting  in numerous  liens  being filed, a complete lockdown of the  site, and millions of dollars in unpaid  bills to local subcontractors.  There has been concern that we have  1,000 new personnel who are going to be  coming into Moody by 2009 under the  BRAC, and this housing project is specifically designed to accommodate the  influx. I have written two letters to the  Air Force expressing my concern and  inquiring about the delay and the intended plan of action. In response, the  Air Force has said that because it has  no  legal agreements with  the  contractor, issues of nonpayment between  the  contractor  and  subcontractors  must be resolved through the legal system.  That  is not an acceptable answer.  The Air Force is a contractor. This directly affects the quality of life of Air  Force personnel at Moody Air Force  Base as well as the other bases that  have  contracts with  this particular  contractor. Air Force personnel are  suffering because of the poor performance of this contractor, and the Air  Force should have been more proactive  to fix this problem before we got to  this point.  I have several questions on this issue  that have yet to be answered. I am specifically asking the Air Force to answer: First, what were the factors contributing  to  the decision  to award  Carabetta Enterprises, Inc. this contract, given their known previous defaults  and  bankruptcy  declarations?  Secondly, is the Air Force currently  taking steps to terminate this contract  and, if so, what steps are they taking  and, if not, why not? Thirdly, what is  the plan for housing the incoming Air  Force personnel slated to live in the  new quarters at Moody Air Force base  as well as the other bases that are affected  by  the  default  of  this  contractor?  In my opinion, this issue is also ripe  for an IG investigation to figure out  exactly what went wrong, why this  contractor was awarded a $3.3 billion  contract  for privatized housing, covering five States, work on all of which  has been halted.  I urge the Air Force’s expeditious attention and resolution of this issue.  I yield the floor.  ",2007

Her outstanding academic merits and communal involvement have  laid a solid  foundation of  individual  integrity  and dedication: both characteristics of a qualified leader. I am honored to represent such a  promising young woman.  Created in 1956, the People to People Program  is an educational  travel program dedicated to fostering leadership potential in youth  worldwide. People to People has helped more  than 200,000 students and professionals develop  their  leadership  skills  based  upon  Dwight D. Eisenhower’s belief  that  ‘‘people  can make a difference where governments  cannot.’’ This unique interaction and exposure  will enable Ms. Adair to gain a greater understanding and  insider’s perspective of Washington, DC.  Madam Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to  acknowledge one of Colorado’s own. Please  join me in congratulating Ms. Adair and wishing her the best in her future endeavors.  f  HONORING  THE  50TH  SARY  OF  GREATER  TEMPLE COGIC  ANNIVERCOLEMAN  HON. DALE E.

2264,127,2007-09-05,Mr. KILDEE.," Madam Speaker, today I would  like  to pay  tribute  to  the Greater Coleman  Temple Church of God in Christ as the pastor  and congregation celebrate their 50th anniversary. A celebration will be held on September  9 in Saginaw, Michigan, in recognition of this  momentous occasion. Bishop Roger L. Jones,  pastor of Greater Holy Temple Church of God  in Christ and prelate of the Southeast Michigan Jurisdiction will be the featured speaker  and the theme is ‘‘Celebrating a Glorious Past,  Embracing a Promising Future!’’  Dr. Hurley J. Coleman and Dr. Martha W.  Coleman founded the Greater Coleman Temple on September 7, 1957, under the name of  Johnson Street Mission Church of God  in  Christ. Services were held in the garage attached to Pastor Coleman’s home. Inspired by  God, Pastor Coleman worked to fulfill the vision of building a church. In June 1961, with  less  than  30 members,  a  groundbreaking  ceremony was held and  the Johnson Street  Mission became  the Liberty Park Church of  God in Christ.  The  first mortgage was burned  is 1972  ahead of its maturity date. April 1975 saw the  groundbreaking for Phase II. When that mortgage was paid ahead of schedule, the congregation  looked  to expand and held  the  groundbreaking for Phase III in August 1989.  Blessed with a congregation that continues to  grow, the church has now moved to its third  location at the World Outreach Campus.  In 1997 both Pastor and Mother Coleman  received  their Doctorates  in Ministry. Martha  Coleman  passed  away  on December  14,  1999, and Pastor Coleman was called to the  Lord on  July 2, 2001. Their  son, Superintendent Hurley J. Coleman, Jr., and his wife,  Evangelist Sandra Coleman,  assumed  the  leadership mantle of Greater Coleman Temple  Church of God in Christ and continue to invigorate the congregation.  Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives  to  join me  in  congratulating  Greater Coleman Temple on 50 years of worship, prayer and evangelism. May the clergy,  staff and congregation continue to thrive doing  the work of our Lord, Jesus Christ.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF REVEREND  JOHN J. BRYK  HON. DENNIS J.

Father  John has devoted his entire life to the work of  the church, and Cleveland has been blessed  with Father John’s commitment  to  living  the  gospel  imperative of service  to and  love of  others.  Since his ordination  in 1953, Father John  has been a faithful servant to the Cleveland  community. As a parish priest, Father John  has been  responsible  for  the spiritual well-  being of a whole community, a responsibility  he took very seriously and fulfilled with enthusiasm and total commitment to his congregation. As an educator, Father John imparted to  Cleveland’s youth  the wisdom  to be well-  rounded, upstanding adults committed to serving all humans. As a former student of Father  John at Saint John Cantius  in Cleveland,  I  have  firsthand experience of Father John’s  ability to affect the lives of those around him.  Madam Speaker and colleagues, please join  me in honoring Reverend John J. Bryk’s 54  years of ministry to the city of Cleveland. I am  grateful for his dedication to the spiritual and  communal needs of Cleveland. May his simple  and abundant  love of his congregation and  Cleveland serve as an example for us all.

2266,127,2007-09-05,Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas.,"  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2850,  the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act of 2007.  The bill proposes a program to coordinate  federally funded research, development, demonstration, education, and technology transfer  activities related to green chemistry.  Protecting our environment has, for years,  been a priority for me. Dallas and other cities  in Texas have long suffered from poor environmental quality, leading to serious health effects in our population.  If Congress can incentivize chemical manufacturing and  research processes  that minimize environmental harms,  then we will be  doing a good thing for our constituents.  As a member of the House Committee on  Science and Technology,  I support  this  research because of  the  long-term benefits  it  brings to all citizens.  Mr. Speaker, the committee has held hearings on this subject and deem it to be needed,  and of worthy investment.  I support H.R. 2850 and urge its passage.  f  RECOGNIZING  EDWARD  JOHN  DEML  III FOR ACHIEVING THE  RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT  HON.

Over the  many years Edward has been  involved with  Scouting, he has not only earned numerous  merit badges, but also the respect of his family, peers, and community.

As a prominent  community,  the  Ismailis  have contributed largely to the cultural diversity and economic development  in Texas.  Under the guidance of His Highness the Aga  Khan, the Ismailis are represented in the fields  of engineering, science, medicine, education,  and entrepreneurship.  In 1967, the first international non-profit institution ofthe Ismailis was established by the  Aga Khan in Europe. Since then the Aga Khan  Development Network has grown  into nine  agencies, globally  representing  the  fields of  micro  finance, education, economic development, health, and cultural preservation.  These agencies have created 300 schools  in the world, educating 62,000 students and  employing 5,000 staff.  It has opened 200  health centers, caring for nearly 2 million and  employing nearly 10,000  staff  It has also  opened a university  in Central Asia,  transformed a park in Egypt, and continues to raise  funds for the poor through an annual world-  wide Partnership Walk.  The  Ismailis are devoted  to  improving  the  circumstances and opportunities for the poor  around the world. The Aga Khan Development  Network serves as a catalyst  for  these endeavors. Their mandates  range  ITom education and health to structural design, disaster  reduction, development, and renewal of historic cities.  On behalf of the 30th Congressional District  of Texas,  I am honored  to congratulate  the  Ismaili Community on  their Golden Jubilee.  Their efforts  towards global humanitarianism  make them an invaluable member of the Dallas area.  f  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON. TIMOTHY V.

MCLEAD; SOUTH TEXAN LOST IN  IRAQ  HON. SOLOMON P. ORTIZ  OFTEXAS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 5, 2007  ",2007
2270,134,2007-09-05,Mr. ORTIZ.," Madam Speaker,  since  this  House last met, another South Texan from the  Coastal Bend area has fallen in battle in Iraq,  and I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this life lost in the service of our nation.  Army SGT Garrett  I. McLead, 23,  from  Rockport, Texas, was assigned  to  the 2nd  Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry  Division, Schofield Barracks, in Hawaii. While  many people across the nation were starting  school, enjoying vacation, or  just  taking advantage of the last weeks before Labor Day,  Sgt. McLead was killed on August 22, 2007, in  a Black Hawk helicopter crash during a night  mission  180 miles  north  of Baghdad,  in  Multaka, Iraq, near the city of Kirkuk.  Sergeant McLead is survived by his parents,  Patrick and Patty, and by the larger family of  Aransas Pass and San Patricio County  in  South Texas.  Madam Speaker, each time we lose a soldier—a member of our American family—we  lose a little piece of ourselves. Each time, it is  just unbearable. Let me tell you more about  this noble patriot who gave the last full measure of devotion to the nation he loved.  Sergeant McLead drew his strength from his  faith, and was a natural athlete, excelling in  surfing,  tennis and soccer while he was  in  high school. He also played the saxophone in  his high school band. He had a winning smile  and a talent for life.  He was an adventure seeker, tempered by  the national shock of 9–11. The searing pain  of the attack moved him from happy-go-lucky  teenager  to a determined warrior at warp  speed. He deferred a dream of modeling or  acting when our nation was attacked on 9–11,  and the country called all patriots for service  in the U.S. military.  Rather than opting for Hollywood, his handsome  face was assigned  to Afghanistan  in  service of finding and tracking down the terrorists who attacked the United States. Iraq was  soon opened as a second war, and he served  the nation in uniform in Iraq as well. He was  close to coming home, but his tour was extended.  Everyone in the greater South Texas community will miss him, but nobody will miss him  like his family. We mourn with this family; we  lift up our broken hearts  in gratitude  to his  family, and we all want  to see our soldiers  come home from these wars.  Madam Speaker, I ask the House to join me  in honoring Army Sergeant McLead and his  service on behalf of the United States, and to  offer our thanks and our deepest sympathy to  the family of this warrior, who gave the last full  measure of devotion  to our nation and  the  United States Army.  f  TRIBUTE TO MITRE CORPORATION  IN HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA  HON.

2276,9,2007-09-14,Mr. TIM MURPHY of Pennsylvania.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today to recognize the medical  career of Dr. Pascal Daniel Spino of Greensburg, PA.  After 60 years of serving  the citizens of  Greensburg as a pediatrician, Dr. Spino is retiring from practice. The genuine concern and  compassion Dr. Spino gave his patients on a  daily basis  is appreciated more  than words  can say. The sincere love and care his patients received should serve as a model to all  who practice medicine.  Dr. Spino has had a  truly remarkable career. But he is a modest man who would not  boast about his many accomplishments or  awards. So let me mention just a few. Always  having a big heart for the less fortunate, Dr.  Spino  founded  the  first Well Baby Clinic  in  Westmoreland County which serves  indigent  children from birth to 6 years of age. The clinic  provides free exams and immunizations to the  indigent  children of Southwestern Pennsylvania. Dr. Spino has personally manned the  clinic since it began in 1954.  In 1970, when a patient, Jacob, was suffering from biliary atresia (a rare condition in  newborn  infants  in which  the common bile  duct between the liver and the small intestine  is blocked or absent),  the  townspeople of  Greensburg, PA, responded generously with  donations to help with the high medical costs.  This tradition has carried on and the ‘‘Joy of  Jacob’’  fund  is still active and successful  in  helping to treat children with birth defects.  Dr. Spino  took notice of abused children  with no place to go. He felt for them and decided to take action in 1972, by founding the  RANCH, or Render Any Needy Child Help  program. A program designed solely  to provide medical care  for abused children. Dr.  Spino then went on to create a Level II Nursery at Westmoreland Regional Hospital for the  care of infants and helped create a modern  pediatric department at Westmoreland Regional Hospital with intensive care capabilities.  Dr. Spino has received a number of awards  including: Man of the Year by the Pittsburgh  Tribune-Review for his outstanding service to  the community; the Pennsylvania Pediatrician  of  the Year  in 1989 by  the Pennsylvania  Chapter of the Academy of Pediatrics and was  honored with  ‘‘Doctor Spino Day,’’  in Westmoreland County for his lifetime commitment  to helping others. Over 4,000 people—1⁄4 of  the City’s residents were in attendance—despite a downpour of rain.  In my practice as a child psychologist, our  paths have crossed several  times over  the  years through our patients. I know first-hand  the tremendous respect and affection patients  and professionals alike have for Dr. Spino. I  understand  first-hand  the  joy of helping a  child. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Spino’s career, personal sacrifice  and devotion to improving our health care system and helping others.  f  SUPPORT OUR FRIEND AND ALLY:  TAIWAN  HON.

2279,4,2007-09-21,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President, I support passage of the Levin-Reed amendment and a new course of action in  Iraq.  This amendment makes three significant and important changes in our involvement in Iraq that to this point  the administration has been unwilling  to make, even though the American  people have been demanding change for  over a year.  First, it removes our troops from the  civil war they are now policing and  gives them three achievable missions:  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:27 Sep 22, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G21SE6.004 S21SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 6 C P D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  ",2007
2281,11,2007-09-21,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, to alert  my colleagues, I will take somewhere  between 20 and 30 minutes to speak on  this  issue  this morning, and  I will  speak on it again prior to our finally  voting on it on Tuesday.  Look, as I said, I have been a Senator  since I was 29 years old. I have been  here for seven Presidents, and I have  observed that sometimes, on issues relating to national crises, whether it be  domestic or foreign, events conspire to  generate the kind of support  for an  idea that when it was first offered had  few adherents. I think we are approaching that now.  The  amendment Senators BROWNBACK, BOXER, SPECTER, KERRY, and I, as  well as Senator HUTCHISONand others  have says that U.S. policy should support a political  settlement  in  Iraq  based on the principles of federalism.  Look,  for all the division  in Washington and across the country over the  policy in Iraq, one thing just about everyone accepts,  literally—left,  right,  center, the President, the Congress, the  American people, and the so-called experts—is that there is no military solution in Iraq. Let me say that again.  There is no military solution in Iraq.  I, along with Senator MCCAIN—in  fact, shortly after the war began—said  that I thought it was foolish to start  this war. But once we started  it, I  thought: My Lord, we  should have  more American forces there. I argued  for up to 100,000 more American forces  in the first year so things would not  get out of hand. I argued we needed  5,900 Gendarme  paramilitary  police  from  the  international  community.  The Europeans were prepared to participate  to  literally  restore order—  make sure people didn’t run the traffic  lights or break into museums or engage  in  thuggery  and  robbery  and  crimes of ordinary violence, having  nothing to do with sectarian divides.  But we have passed that point.  To paraphrase General Petraeus, although he doesn’t seem to be as adherent to his original comment, and he  was paraphrasing someone else—I believe it was 3 or 4 years ago when we  were in Iraq with him, and I am looking over my shoulder at my staff generally; at the time I think it was 3  years ago—he said, and  I am paraphrasing, there comes a point in every  liberation where it becomes an occupation. There comes a point in every liberation effort where it becomes an occupation. And we have reached that  point. We reached that point 3 years  ago. I argued we reached that point  when we went in.  We  had  one  brief,  brief moment  where, having mistakenly moved when  we did, in my view, had we acted more  responsibly instead of out of the arrogance  and hubris  that  existed, we  might, we might have been able to  change the dynamic drastically. But  that has long passed. That has long  passed.  I guess the point I want to make,  again, and the end result of all I am  saying here is you will not find a single  person who thinks that a military solution will work alone. So what we are  all about here today is what everybody  says: OK, there has to be a political solution, but literally, I say to you, Mr.  President, up to this moment no one on  the floor of the Senate has offered a political solution. I mean, it is really fundamental. There  is nobody who has  said: We all acknowledge there is no  military solution. And by the way, I  am not claiming I am the only one. I  have many cosponsors. We have a lot of  people now saying: OK, we acknowledge there is a need for a political solution, embedded in the notion I have  been pushing for a couple of years now  and in detail for the last year and a  half or so with Les Gelb.  I have  to  recognize Les Gelb,  a  former  administration  official  in  a  Democratic  administration,  in  the  Carter administration,  the president  emeritus of the New York Council on  Foreign Relations, an  incredibly  respected voice in American foreign policy, and thought of as a genuine scholar. Les and I started off not in full  agreement of what that political solution was, but we were all on the same  page. The end result of all this is that  the underlying premise of Les Gelb and  JOEBIDEN in generating this was that  the political solution we are proposing,  which is what the Iraqi Constitution  essentially calls for—and it is not partition—is federalism.  Well, guess what. It is not going to  happen  spontaneously.  The  Iraqis  aren’t going to spontaneously decide in  the midst of what is now a civil war  and sectarian strife that they know  how to do it on their own.  So getting back to the political question, everyone says there is a need for  a political solution. But that begs the  question, So what is your political solution?  The critics, and there is legitimate  criticism of the Biden-Gelb plan, but  the critics have come along and said: I  don’t  like your plan, BIDEN. My response has been from the outset: If you  don’t like mine, what is yours? Think  about it. Think about, as you consider  whether  the Biden-Brownback  plan,  which is essentially taking Biden-Gelb  and putting it into an amendment to  the Defense authorization bill—think  about what it says. We say this is our  political  solution. This  is what we  think is the way out.  So as I began this debate, my invitation to my colleagues was: I get it. You  may not like all parts of it. You may  not like it. You may think it is mostly  correct. You may be able to  legitimately point out there are weaknesses  in it; things may or may not happen. I  can’t guarantee an outcome to this.  But I would like you to think about it.  If you don’t  like BIDEN’S proposal,  what is your idea?  Up to now, a lot of us have had what  we voted on  just a moment ago. It  started off as the Biden-Hagel-Levin  amendment back in January and February. I agree with it totally. It is now  Levin-Reed. I think it is a good amendment. It is essentially the same one we  voted on twice before. I was the author  of it, along with my friend from Michigan, the leader of the Armed Services  Committee. But the truth is, it is not a  political solution. It is an important  tactic to reach the point we all want to  reach.  And what  is  that? When you cut  through all of this, what  is  it the  American people, what is it all my colleagues, all 100 of us, want? No one  wants to keep American forces there,  with almost 3,800 dead, close to 28,000  wounded,  roughly  14,000  severely  wounded and who are going to require  medical attention and care the rest of  their lives. No one in here wants that.  If we could wave a wand, there is not a  single Member, from the most conservative to the most liberal in this body,  who wouldn’t take every troop out if  they could, tomorrow. We don’t want  our kids going. I don’t want my son  going, my daughter going. I don’t want  my grandkids going, either.  What is recognized underneath all of  this is there is a clear understanding  that even though most of us on this  side of  the aisle opposed what  the  President did and how he did it, there  is a recognition that it matters what  we leave behind. It matters a whole  bunch.  It matters  for  our  grandchildren. It matters for our children.  Look,  folks,  there  is  an  overwhelming desire. I live with a woman I  adore. We have been married  for 30  years. She is unalterably opposed to  this war. She, like every mother, lives  in fear that her son, who is a captain in  the Army, is going to be sent over,  which is probable. So her fervent wish  every time I go home is: JOE, get them  out of there. Get them out of there.  You are chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee;  get  them  out  of  there.

2282,18,2007-09-21,Mr. DODD.," Madam President, I wanted to take a moment to explain why I  voted against the Levin-Reed amendment on Iraq.  Let me say at the outset that I am  second to none in this body in my opposition to the President’s failed policy  in Iraq. Yesterday I spoke in strong  support and voted  for the Feingold-  Reid amendment that would have set  forth a clear and enforceable deadline  for ending our military involvement in  the  unwinnable  civil war  in  Iraq.  Sadly, only 27 of our colleagues joined  with me in voting for the Feingold-  Reid amendment.  I do not doubt the sincerity of Senators LEVINand REED in offering their  amendment. These have been two articulate voices in the Senate calling  for a change in our policy in Iraq for  some time now. They like many of our  colleagues have spoken out strongly  about the failure of the President’s policy and highlighted the fact that this  policy has made our Nation less safe  and has broken our military. But I believe this President will not admit failure or change policy unless we force  him to, and the only effective instrument available to this Congress to do  so is to exercise its power of the purse  and cut off funding for this war, once  our men and women in uniform have  been safely withdrawn from Iraq. That  is what the Feingold amendment would  have accomplished, and that is what  any amendment that I will vote for  henceforth must do.  We all know this President doesn’t  understand  subtlety. He  has  demonstrated time and time again that he  doesn’t respect this Congress or even  the law. How many signing statements  has this President issued in which he  outlines ways to ignore or circumvent  the laws written by this Congress? Too  many. How many innocent Americans  have  been  subject  to  illegal,  warrantless wiretaps  authorized  by  this President? Too many. How many  falsehoods and deceits have been perpetrated by this President to justify  his disastrous war of choice in Iraq?  Too many.  There is only one way to force this  President to change course in Iraq and  that is to take away the money required for him to conduct that war.  Iraqi officials need to be convinced as  well that we truly mean it when we say  it is time for them to take responsibility for their country and not count  on us indefinitely to fight their fight  for them.  If we are truly being honest with the  American people when we say we are  fighting to end this failed policy, we  must do everything possible to do so.  That is why while I respect the efforts  of my colleagues Senators LEVIN and  REED, I felt compelled to vote against  their amendment.  I hope the next time this body debates the war in Iraq, many more of  our colleagues will join with Senator  FEINGOLDand me in voting for a clear  and enforceable deadline to end our  military involvement in Iraq and set  on a new course that makes our Nation  more  secure and allows our broken  military to begin to rebuild.  Too many days have passed and too  many lives have been lost while this  Congress has stood by and not acted.  That must end.  ",2007
2283,18,2007-09-21,Mr. AKAKA.," Madam President, yesterday I offered, along with my colleague Senator WEBB, an amendment  to the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2008 that would require the Secretary of the Army and  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  prepare a report on plans to replace the  monument at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery.  Our amendment seeks to clarify the  plans of the Secretaries to replace the  monument at the Tomb of the Unknown due to cosmetic cracks that  have appeared over time in the facing  of the monument. It would require the  Secretaries to provide Congress with a  description of the current efforts to  maintain and preserve the monument  and an assessment of the  feasibility  and advisability of  repairing  rather  then  replacing  it. The  Secretaries  would also be required to report on  their plans to replace the monument  and, if replaced, how they intend to  dispose of the current monument. Our  amendment would prevent the Secretaries from taking action to replace  the monument until 180 days after the  receipt of the report.  The Army contends that the cracks  in the monument diminish the aesthetic value of the monument and that  the cracks justify the monument’s replacement. The Army’s position is that  the cracks in the monument cannot be  fixed and that it will continue to deteriorate. The Army also contends that  the  surface  of  the monument  has  weathered to the point that, within the  next 15 years, the details of the carving  are expected to be eroded to the extent  that  the  experience of visiting  the  tomb will be adversely effected. They  justify  its  replacement by asserting  that the Tomb of the Unknowns has  significance beyond it historic origins  and therefore should be maintained in  as perfect of a state as possible.  This position is not shared by many  civic and preservation groups who believe the monument can and should be  preserved and repaired. This view  is  also shared by the preservation architects who completed the last formal  study of repairs to the Tomb of the Unknowns  in  1990. Supporters of preserving the current monument view it  VerDate Aug 31 2005  00:27 Sep 22, 2007 Jkt 059060 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G21SE6.013 S21SEPT1 E T A N E S h t i w 1 6 C P D O R P n o n o s n h o a b j         ",2007

2292,25,2007-09-21,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, I am  going to make a few comments this  morning about a hearing we just completed in the Democratic policy committee, but  I am waiting  for  some  charts. While I am waiting for those  charts, I want to talk a moment about  what is happening with respect to the  debate here in this Chamber dealing  with the war in Iraq. It relates to some  things I said on the floor of the Senate  yesterday but I think really bear repeating.  We are talking about the war in Iraq,  the need to attempt to change course  in Iraq, and yesterday I described again  what the latest National Intelligence  Estimate tells us. Now, all of us have  access to this. There  is a classified  version, a  top-secret version, and a  nonclassified version, but all of us have  access  to  this  information. Here  is  what  it says  in the context of protecting this country and providing security and safety for this country. Here  is what the National Intelligence Estimate says:  Al-Qaida is and will remain the most serious terrorist threat to the homeland. We assess the group has protected or regenerated  key elements of its homeland attack capability, including: a safe haven in the Pakistan  federally  administered  tribal  areas,  operational lieutenants, and its top leadership.  Here  is what  it says.  It says the  greatest terrorist threat to our homeland is al-Qaida and its leadership, who  even now are plotting attacks against  our country and who have a safe haven  in the Pakistan region. Now, if that is  the case, it is quite clear that the central  fight on terrorism  is not going  door to door in Baghdad in the middle  of a civil war. Yet that is what we are  doing.  I have asked this question, and I have  repeatedly asked it: Why should there  be 1 square inch on the planet Earth  that is secure or safe for Osama bin  Laden and the leadership of al-Qaida?  Yet our National Intelligence Estimate  says they are in a safe haven. A ‘‘safe  haven.’’ These  are  the  people who  boasted of killing Americans on 9/11.  They boasted about engineering 19 terrorists aboard airplanes full of fuel and  passengers, and they ran them  into  buildings, killing innocent Americans.  And 6 years later, our National Intelligence Estimate tells us that those  who engineered that attack have regrouped, are developing new training  camps for terrorists, and are in a safe  haven and developing new plans to attack America. That is unbelievable to  me.  We are debating the war  in  Iraq,  which our National Intelligence Estimate also says is largely sectarian violence, or a civil war. Yes, there is some  al-Qaida in Iraq, but that is not the  central front, and that is not the central war on terrorism. If, in fact, our  role as a responsible country is to protect our citizens, then it seems to me  we would change course and change  strategy so that we are taking the  fight to the terrorists and fighting the  terrorists first.  We have been bogged down—longer  now than in the Second World War—in  what has become a civil war in Iraq.  Meanwhile,  the  greatest  terrorist  threat to our homeland is in a safe  haven. Osama bin Laden, al-Zawahiri,  and others, the leadership of al-Qaida,  in a safe haven.  What are the consequences of that  safe haven? Let me show a newspaper  report from last week. All of us understand this because we heard about it.  They picked up terrorists in Denmark,  they picked up terrorists in Germany.  The terrorists in Germany were plotting attacks against the largest U.S.  military base  in Europe. Where did  those terrorists train? In Pakistan. In  terrorist training camps in Pakistan.  We are now seeing the fruit of what  has been allowed to happen—the leadership of al-Qaida in a safe or secure  place,  operating  or  developing new  training camps, training new terrorists  to launch attacks against our country.

2295,32,2007-09-21,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President,  in the  aftermath of the Virginia Tech massacre, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine  commissioned a panel of experts to  conduct an independent review of the  tragedy and make  recommendations  regarding improvements to Virginia’s  laws, policies and procedures. Late last  month, the Virginia Tech Review Panel  released its report.  The panel was given  the difficult  task of reviewing the events, assessing  the actions taken and not taken, identifying the lessons learned, and proposing alternatives for the future. This  included a detailed review of Seung Hui  Cho’s  background  and  interactions  with the mental health and legal systems, as well as the circumstances surrounding his gun purchases. Additionally, they assessed the emergency responses by law enforcement officials,  university officials, medical examiners,  hospital care providers and the medical  examiner. Finally, the panel reviewed  the university’s approach to helping  families, survivors, students and staff  as they deal with the mental trauma  incurred by the tragedy.  Among  other  things,  the  report  points to weak enforcement of and gaps  in regulations regarding the purchase  of guns, as well as holes in State and  Federal privacy laws. It talks about  the critical need for improved background checks and the inherent danger  the presence of firearms can present on  college  campuses. Tragically, many  proponents of gun safety  legislation  have  previously  unsuccessfully  attempted to enact the very  improvements recommended in the panel’s report. The tragedy at Virginia Tech underscores the need to strengthen gun  safety laws. I urge Congress to wait no  longer in taking up and passing sensible gun legislation.  I ask unanimous consent to include  the Virginia Tech Review Panel’s primary recommendations regarding firearm laws in the RECORD.  VI–1 All states should report information  necessary  to  conduct  federal background  checks on gun purchases. There should be  federal incentives to ensure compliance. This  should apply to states whose requirements  are different from federal law. States should  become fully compliant with federal law that  disqualifies persons from purchasing or possessing firearms who have been found by a  court or other lawful authority to be a danger to themselves or others as a result of  mental illness. Reporting of such information should include not just those who are  disqualified because they have been found to  be dangerous, but all other categories of disqualification as well. In a society divided on  many gun control issues, laws that specify  who  is prohibited  from owning a  firearm  stand as examples of broad agreement and  should be enforced.  VI–2 Virginia should require background  checks for all firearms sales, including those  at gun shows. In an age of widespread information technology, it should not be too difficult for anyone, including private sellers,  to contact  the Virginia Firearms Transaction Program for a background check that  usually only takes minutes before transferring a firearm. The program already processes transactions made by registered dealers at gun shows. The practice should be expanded to all sales.  Virginia should also provide an enhanced  penalty for guns sold without a background  check and later used in a crime.  VI–3 Anyone found to be a danger to themselves or others by a court-ordered review  should be entered in the Central Criminal  Records Exchange database  regardless of  whether they voluntarily agreed to treatment. Some people examined for a mental  illness and found to be a potential threat to  themselves or others are given the choice of  agreeing to mental treatment voluntarily to  avoid being ordered by the courts to be  treated involuntarily. That does not appear  on their records, and they are free to purchase guns. Some highly respected people  knowledgeable about the interaction of mentally ill people with the mental health system are strongly opposed to requiring voluntary treatment to be entered on the record  and be sent to a state database.  Their concern is that it might reduce the  incentive  to  seek  treatment  voluntarily,  which has many advantages to the individuals (e.g., less time in hospital, less stigma,  less cost) and to the legal and medical personnel involved (e.g., less time, less paperwork,  less cost). However, there still are  powerful incentives to take the voluntary  path, such as a shorter stay in a hospital and  not having a record of mandatory treatment.  It does not seem logical to the panel to allow  someone found to be dangerous to be able to  purchase a firearm.  VI–4 The existing attorney general’s opinion regarding the authority of universities  and colleges to ban guns on campus should  be clarified immediately. The universities in  Virginia have received or developed various  interpretations of the  law. The Commonwealth’s attorney general has provided some  guidance to universities, but additional clarity is needed from the attorney general or  from state legislation regarding guns at universities and colleges.  VI–5  The  Virginia  General  Assembly  should adopt legislation in the 2008 session  clearly establishing the right of every institution of higher education in the Commonwealth to regulate the possession of firearms  on campus if it so desires. The panel recommends that guns be banned on campus  grounds and in buildings unless mandated by  law.  VI–6 Universities and colleges should make  clear in their literature what their policy is  regarding weapons on campus. Prospective  students and their parents, as well as university staff, should know the policy related to  concealed weapons so they can decide whether they prefer an armed or arms-free learning environment.  f  JUDGE MICHAEL B.

2297,46,2007-09-21,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, today the  Senate considers The Gang Abatement  and Prevention Act of 2007, a bill concerned with the Nation’s growing gang  problem. I want to thank Senator FEINSTEINfor her tireless work on this issue  over many years and, in particular, for  working diligently with me to address  my concerns and to formulate what I  hope we all agree is an even better  gang bill.  Violent crime in America is again on  the rise. This troubling news is in my  view at least in part the result of the  Bush administration’s failure to heed  the lessons learned from our successful  fight against violent crime in the 1990s.  Congress and the Clinton administration provided significant new funding  to strengthen State and local law enforcement and supported programs to  prevent gang and youth violence. Our  efforts worked. Studies have repeatedly  shown  that, violent crime and  gang offenses steadily dropped to historic lows. But the Bush administration chose a different course, and, despite warnings from me and others, has  repeatedly cut funding for State and  local cops on the beat and community  programs targeting the prevention of  youth crime.  I hope that this bill will be part of a  return to productive law enforcement  strategies that worked so well in the  past. I share the views expressed at the  hearing in June by Los Angeles Police  Chief William J. Bratton  that  ‘‘we  can’t arrest our way out of our gang  crime problem.’’ As those who have  worked on this issue for years know all  too well, we must match our commitment to law enforcement with an equal  commitment to intervention and prevention as a means of curbing gang violence. Neither strategy works without  the other, and I believe, as so many law  enforcement and civil leaders do, that  any  legislative  proposal  to  address  gang violence must focus on new means  to prevent youth and gang violence. I  am glad that Senator FEINSTEIN’s bill  now reflects these priorities.  The Gang Abatement and Prevention  Act of 2007 represents a significant improvement over earlier gang  legislation. It does not contain the death penalties, mandatory minimums, and exSTEIN pansive  juvenile  transfer  provisions  that were among my strongest objections to some past proposals. Further,  Senator FEINSTEINhas worked with me  and others to ensure that this bill will  provide  some of  the  resources necessary to reverse the policies of this  administration, which have neglected  the officers who combat gang violence  on a daily basis and the organizations  that work  to keep children out of  gangs. I particularly appreciate provisions in the bill to provide up to $1 billion over 10 years to support collaborative law enforcement and community  prevention efforts, with a significant  portion of that amount going to civic  groups for innovative prevention programs that truly work to reduce gang  violence.  I have long said that I don’t believe  that  sweeping  new Federal  crimes,  which  federalize  the kind of  street  crime that States have traditionally  addressed and  can handle with  the  right resources and assistance, are the  right way to go. The bill still contains  more emphasis on federalizing crime  and mandating sentences than I would  like. But I have tried to work with  Senator FEINSTEINto reduce its impact  on the sphere of criminal law traditionally handled by the States and to focus  on the most serious offenders and conduct,  for which Federal attention  is  needed. I also appreciate Senator FEINand Senator SCHUMERworking  with Senator WHITEHOUSE and me to  ensure that small States such as Rhode  Island and Vermont could be eligible  under the bill to receive crucially important witness protection grants.  We all care deeply about eradicating  gang violence, and we must work together to create a comprehensive solution to this troubling, persistent problem. I hope that this bill will be a step  toward reversing the mistakes of the  Bush  administration  and  reinvigorating our efforts to provide Federal  support for those who combat gang violence every day and to protect those  who are its victims.

2298,46,2007-09-21,Mr. HATCH.," I rise today to congratulate my fellow Senators on the passage  of the Gang Abatement and Prevention  Act  of  2007. This  vital  legislation  makes important changes to the federal criminal code which will allow a  more effective response to the ever  growing  threat  that  violent  street  gangs present to our society.  Americans are acutely aware of the  myriad problems brought about by the  influence and prevalence of criminal  gangs  in  this country.  I have  long  shared  this concern, and  introduced  legislation over 10 years ago that attempted to address the problem. Senator FEINSTEINjoined me in that effort,  and since that time has pursued this  matter with a vigor and tenacity that  should make the residents of California  proud.

2300,3,2007-10-01,Ms. CASTOR.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of House Resolution 691 commending  the Wings Over Houston Airshow for its  great contribution to the appreciation,  understanding,  and  future  of  the  United States Armed Forces, the City  of Houston, Texas, and Ellington Field.  I would like to thank my colleague  from Texas, Mr. NICK for  bringing this measure to the floor of  the House.  The Wings Over Houston Airshow is  one of the highest rated events of its  kind. This coming Saturday and Sunday,  folks  from  Congressman  LAMPSON’s district and, in fact, from  all over America, will come to see  these mighty military machines maneuver through the skies with seeming  ease. These classic and contemporary  airframes break their bounds to Earth  and share the heavens with the sun and  clouds.  It’s a rare experience to see with  your own eyes the awe-inspiring airborne arsenal of our Armed Forces. It’s  difficult to explain the seemingly impossible coordination our pilots execute in midair. No one can truly understand the peril, skill, and thrill  involved except for the pilots themselves;  yet our extraordinarily talented men  and women fly in conditions that require nothing less than perfection. And  visitors will have that rare glimpse of  airborne art.  Spectators will be visited by  the  Texas Air National Guard 147th Fighter  Squadron. Their TANG F–16s will tear  rifts through the sky as they buzz by.  The Texas Air National Guard F–16s  are at a state of constant readiness,  prepared to defend the great State of  Texas and our Nation at a moment’s  call.  Attendees will also have the chance  to see Canadian Forces Snowbirds, the  P–38, the B–24A, a heritage flight consisting of the F–4 Phantom, the P–51  Mustang, the P–47 Thunderbolt, and  the F–15E Strike Eagle, and a number  of Navy fighters among them.  Mr. Speaker, the Wings Over Houston  Airshow provides an important experience for folks to understand and to see  the many machines that help our brave  men and women in uniform protect us.  I urge my  colleagues  to  support  House Resolution 691.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

Mr. Speaker, for 23 years, the Wings  Over Houston Airshow has been delighting aviation enthusiasts and future pilots from around the world with  spectacular  flying  in the skies, and  with historical and educational displays on the ground in Ellington Field.  This top-rated aviation event, which  is sponsored by the all-volunteer Gulf  Coast Wing and West Houston Squadron of the Commemorative Air Force,  honors the spirit of the courageous and  valiant American military flyers of the  past and those who take to the skies  today to ensure our Nation’s freedoms.  The Wings Over Houston Airshow  showcases the United States Air Force,  Navy, Marines and Coast Guard, and  increases the awareness and appreciation for active duty members and the  veterans of our Armed Forces.  But more  important  than  the air  show’s entertainment, the Wings Over  Houston Airshow has awarded $10,000 to  $15,000 in scholarships per year to students who are pursuing an education in  aviation and in aerospace. In total, this  organization has provided over $100,000  to young men and women who have entered into careers in both military and  civilian aviation.  The Wings Over Houston Airshow  celebrates  America’s  aviation  and  aerospace history and the courageous  military pilots whose sacrifices have  ensured our freedom. I am confident  that the Wings Over Houston Airshow  will continue to ignite the enthusiasm  for  flying  in  future  generations  of  American aviators.  I strongly urge all Members to support this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

2303,3,2007-10-01,Mr.  LAMPSON.,"  Thank  you, Mr.  Speaker,  for allowing me the opportunity to come and speak on this.  I am proud to honor the Wings Over  Houston Airshow because each year  about 70,000 spectators from around the  world gather in the 22nd Congressional  District of Texas to view this historic  Ellington Field  and  view  re-enactments of great battles, see up-close  views of vintage aircraft, and meet yesterday’s and today’s heroes.  For the last 23 years, as you’ve heard,  pilots  from  our Armed Forces and  around the globe wow audiences with  their high-speed acrobatics. And how  often do we get to see real-life daredevils? Well, this weekend, the Canadian  Forces  Snowbirds  will  demonstrate  their  seven-  to nine-plane  close  formations,  tight  turns,  and  head-on passes. Crowds will get to view  state-of-the-art  military  aircraft,  along with planes from days of old.  This year, the air show brings history  to life through authentic World War II  vehicles, equipment and uniforms at a  realistic military camp. They’re going  to re-enact part of the movie, ‘‘Tora!  Tora! Tora!’’ As a former school teacher, I know activities like these help  promote an understanding and appreciation of military history.  Visitors are going to be able to see  trainers,  fighters, and bombers  from  the World War II, Korea and Vietnam  era, and even NASA aircraft. The air  show presents a unique opportunity to  tour some of the largest aircraft in the  world, including the Hurricane Hunter  KC–135 and a C–5 cargo plane, walk  over the wings of vintage airplanes,  and even sit in the pilot’s seat.  Children have  the  opportunity  to  meet flying aces and decorated war heroes and to hear historical recounts  from the people who were there.  This year’s show features both Pearl  Harbor survivors and the Tuskegee Airmen, who were recently awarded the  Congressional Gold Medal. I am proud  of these  folks, and I know that all  Americans are as well. Meeting living  legends and air show performers is inspiring for young and old alike, and  this  show  is a  rare opportunity  to  thank these heroes  for their service  and for their sacrifice.  Wings Over Houston has spent, in the  last 23 years, a quarter of a million dollars to help challenge young people to  go  into aerospace,  engineering, and  aviation. Many go on to careers in the  military and go  to work at NASA  where they can also gain valuable experience as interns at the Johnson Space  Center, which is across the street from  Ellington Field. With  its  important  contributions, Wings Over Houston ensures that our Nation leads the way in  math and science.  The air show has also donated proceeds  to various  local and national  charities throughout the years, including  the Texas Southern University  Aviation Career Academy,  the Exchange Club of Sugar Land, and the  Commemorative Air Force aircraft restoration  and  flying  historical  programs. Together with their partner,  Wings Over Houston,  it has greatly  contributed  to  the  economy  and  growth of southeast Texas.  So I want to thank the members of  the House Armed Services Committee,  and many of my Texas colleagues, particularly,  for  their cosponsorship of  this resolution. I am pleased to honor  the Wings Over Houston Airshow as a  leader in the history and the future in  the United States Armed Forces.  ",2007

2314,10,2007-10-01,Mr. CLAY.," Madam Speaker, as a  member of the House Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform, I  am pleased to join my colleague in supporting H.R. 2276, which names a postal  facility in Vassar, Michigan, after Corporal Christopher E. Esckelson.  H.R. 2276, which was introduced by  Representative KILDEEof Michigan on  May 10, 2007, was reported from the  Oversight Committee on September 20,  2007, by a voice vote. This measure has  the support of the entire Michigan congressional delegation.  Madam Speaker, Marine Corporal  Christopher E. Esckelson was killed on  December  28,  2006, while conducting  combat operations in al Anbar Province, Iraq. He was assigned to 1st Battalion, 24th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, Lansing, Michigan.  In  October  of  2002,  Corporal  Esckelson joined the U.S. Marine Corps  Reserve and attended Delta College.  His desire was to become a doctor, but  he was called to active duty in April  2006. Corporal Esckelson was extremely  proud to be a marine and committed to  serve his country with distinction and  courage.  Madam Speaker,  I  commend Representative KILDEEfor introducing this  legislation and urge swift passage of  this bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2007
2315,10,2007-10-01,Mr.  WESTMORELAND.,"  Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 2276 honors the  life of a young man who fought bravely  for his country and made the ultimate  sacrifice  for  our  freedom. Corporal  Christopher Esckelson was killed during combat action in Fallujah, Iraq on  December 28, 2006. He was less than 1  week shy of reaching his 23rd birthday.  Christopher Esckelson felt personal  anger after September 11, 2001, when  his country was brutally attacked, and  he knew  immediately he wanted to  serve in the U.S. Marine Corps. In addition to defending his country, it was a  way to earn money  for college. His  plans  included  attending  medical  school. His dream of becoming a doctor, however, was cut short on a 5-day  mission fighting insurgents in a war-  torn Fallujah.  Corporal Esckelson was a squad leader of 12 men and suffered a direct hit  during a mission. His leadership skills  were proven day in and day out while  in Iraq. He knew the risks involved and  experienced the horrors of war. But his  determination to fight and win was evident. He was fearless on the battlefield.  Christopher never had the chance to  return home safely from the war or attend medical school as he planned, but  he will surely be remembered in his  community by the naming of this post  office  in  his  hometown  of Vassar,  Michigan. I am pleased to support H.R.  2276 in naming of the post office for  this valiant soldier.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2007

H.R. 2276 will designate the facility of the United States  Postal Service  located at 203 North  Main Street in Vassar, Michigan, as  the ‘‘Corporal Christopher E. Esckelson  Post Office Building.’’  Corporal Esckelson of Vassar, Michigan, heroically gave his life fighting  for our country in Fallujah, Iraq, on  December 28, 2006, 2 days shy of his 23rd  birthday.  Corporal  Esckelson,  the  squad leader of 12 men, suffered a direct hit while inspecting a truck in  war-torn Fallujah, Iraq.  Corporal  Esckelson’s  leadership  qualities came to fruition long before  he began to serve our country. An outstanding  athlete  at  Vassar  High  School, Christopher Esckelson played  the game of football like he did life,  with great passion. That same passion  is what drove the aspiring doctor to  join the Marines shortly after the September 11 attacks.  He once told his mother, Michelle  Hill, that whatever life might bring, he  still would have been a marine.  His early time in the Marine Corps  Reserve allowed him to earn money to  pay for classes at Delta College, where  he studied premedicine. Other activities Corporal Esckelson enjoyed were  hunting with his  father, David, and  brother, Craig, as well as spending time  with his girlfriend, Samantha Reasner,  who last saw him when she drove him  to the airport when he left for basic  training.  His last contact with his family came  2 days before Christmas 2006 when he  left on a 5-day mission which would ultimately be his last.  For  his  heroism, Corporal Christopher E. Esckelson deserves our recognition and thanks. Designating this  postal  facility  in Vassar, Michigan,  where his mother works will allow all  who enter the post office the unique  opportunity to be mindful of the sacrifices brave young soldiers like Christopher have made and  continue  to  make today.  I would  like  to  thank  the entire  Michigan delegation for their support  on this legislation, and urge all of my  colleagues to join me in passing this  legislation.  ",2007

2321,17,2007-10-01,Mr. POE.," Madam Speaker, Oakland  Airport officials might as well put a  sign:  ‘‘Welcome  to Oakland, but no  U.S. military allowed here.’’  It seems that over 200 marines from  the combat fields of Iraq flew into Oakland, California, and were not allowed  to deplane into the airport. They were  forced off the plane between two runways and had to sit in the grass for 3  hours while waiting to fly to Hawaii.  The troops had flown from Iraq via Kuwait, Germany, and JFK Airport. They  had already been completely screened  by Customs and TSA at JFK, but the  officials at Oakland Airport wouldn’t  let them into the terminal.  One marine said no explanation was  ever given. Interestingly enough, reports say this not the first time Oakland banned the U.S. military from its  airport.  Most airports welcome our returning  troops with patriotism, cheers,  flags  and enthusiastic applause. But not in  Oakland. They  should  be  ashamed.  They should apologize to each marine,  and Congress needs to find out why the  marines were treated so poorly and  even  consider  prohibiting  Federal  funds from going to this airport if it is  shown that the airport is antimilitary.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  SPECIAL ORDERS  The SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Ms.  CLARKE).

2323,17,2007-10-01,Ms. WOOLSEY.," Madam Speaker, the  American people have been opposed to  the occupation of Iraq and they have  been demanding the redeployment of  our troops for a very long time now,  but the word obviously hasn’t reached  our Nation’s leaders.  Last Wednesday, the Secretary of Defense asked Congress  to appropriate  billions of dollars more to continue the  occupation of Iraq. He said that American troops will remain  in  Iraq  for  years to come with no end in sight.  The  occupation  has  already  cost  nearly half a trillion dollars, and what  have we gotten for that investment?  Even General Petraeus couldn’t say for  sure that our involvement in Iraq has  made us any safer when he testified before Congress last month. And the National Intelligence Estimate warned us  in July that al Qaeda is using the occupation  to energize extremists,  raise  money, and to recruit and indoctrinate  operatives  for  attacks  on  the U.S.  homeland.  Madam Speaker, the way to make  America truly safer is to end the occupation, restore our moral leadership in  the world,  and  use  diplomacy  to  strengthen the structure and institutions of international cooperation and  peace. That’s why it is time to tell our  leaders in the White House that Congress isn’t going to be their friendly  neighborhood ATM machine any more.  Congress has the power of the purse.  We can use it to force the administration to change course. We must refuse  to appropriate one more dime for the  occupation. Instead, we must fully fund  the safe, orderly and responsible redeployment of American troops and military contractors out of Iraq.  Redeployment of our troops is the  necessary  first step on the road to  peace. It is clear that Iraq will never  stabilize while American troops and  the vast unaccountable army of 180,000  American military  contractors  are  there.  Our  occupation  of  Iraq  prevents  Iraqis from finding solutions to their  own problems, and  it delays the regional and international diplomatic efforts needed to jump-start a true peace  process.  The administration has said that it  plans to redeploy some troops, but this  is just a tactic, I believe, to win political favor. The arithmetic proves it. We  began this year with 130,000 troops in  Iraq. The escalation brought the level  to 160,000. Now the administration says  it will bring out 30,000 troops so by  next summer we will again have 130,000  troops.  So, Madam Speaker, we end up with  the same number of troops, but the administration calls it a reduction. I call  it fuzzy math. President Bush has created a national mathematics panel to  study ways to improve math education  in America. That  is a  really good  thing, because the President himself  needs help with addition and subtraction.  Actually, Madam Speaker, the only  way to make sure that our troops are  out of harm’s way is to proceed right  now with a full redeployment and end  the fantasy that there is a military solution to this quagmire.  If we fail to use our power of the  purse, if we continue to spend our taxpayer dollars on this occupation  instead of ending it, we will have failed  politically, we will have  failed economically, and we will have failed morally. And we will have failed our brave  troops along with all of the American  people. It is time to bring our troops  home.  f  GREEN BRADY GOLD STAR MOTHERS  ",2007

2325,17,2007-10-01,Mr. POE.," Madam Speaker, yesterday,  under the bright sun and blue sky of  the Texas Sunday afternoon, American  flags  flew  in the silent breeze over  thousands  of  quiet marble uniform  tombstones  in the Houston National  Cemetery. This is where Texans bury  their war dead, men and women who go  off to war for America.  In the center of the  immaculately  kept cemetery, a tribute of sacrifice  was being made to the living: Those  mothers who lost their children in the  wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Mothers of Texas who gave their children that died in their youth so the  rest of us could live in safety were honored on this Gold Star Mothers’ Day.  I was present along with Congressman GENE and Congressman  NICKLAMPSONand Congressman KEVIN  to honor these special ladies.  We, like those present, were emotionally affected.  Gold Star Moms are what we call  them, is a mother who lost a child in  combat. This concept started in World  War II when Grace Seibold learned on  Christmas Eve 1918 that her aviator son  was killed in aerial combat in France.  Grace Seibold directed her grief and  sorrow to helping wounded doughboys  in local D.C. hospitals. She formed the  Gold Star Mothers to give support for  other such moms.  During World War I, if a son had gone  off to war in the War to End All Wars,  as it was called, a banner was hung in  front of the home in the window for  each son in the military. This banner  had a blue star in the center of it. If  the son was killed, a gold star was superimposed over the blue one.  During World War  II, my Grandmother Poe hung such a banner with a  blue star in the front window of her  home in the country. My dad went off  to war when he was just 18. When my  grandmother died, it was one of the few  items she had saved. That banner never  had to have a gold star placed on it because my dad returned safely.  Madam Speaker, here is a banner of a  Gold Star Mother.

It gives me great pleasure at this  time to yield to my colleague and good  friend, a former judge from the great  State of Texas, Congresswoman SHEILA  JACKSON-LEE.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Madam  Speaker,  let me  thank my  distinguished colleague and  friend, chairwoman of the Ethics Committee from  Ohio STEPHANIETUBBSJONES, for more  than this one night. I think that we are  back in the saddle again, and I applaud  the fact that the Congressional Black  Caucus, the conscience of the Congress,  is now reporting the ions and pages  CHRISTENSEN and, if you will, thousands upon thousands of items that we work on and  solve on a daily basis here  in  the  United States Congress. So I want to  thank her for guiding this for a period  of time, and I want to then acknowledge the chairpersons of the 37th Annual Legislative Conference, the Honorable DONNA and G.K.  BUTTERFIELD, who did an outstanding  job. And as well might I acknowledge  and thank, and I know that he will be  speaking soon, the chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Chairman KENDRICKMEEK, and  thank him for his leadership and also  for the opportunity to now journey on  the foundation board as a new member.  As I am a new member of the foundation board, I am delighted to be able to  collaborate with him on some of the  many, many issues that the board will  tackle.  Success; inspirational; exciting; fun;  learned; and, of course, message giving.  That was the 37th annual legislative  session that we just finished here in  Washington, D.C.  Allow me to acknowledge the importance of the Voting Rights session that  MELWATTand I, having served on the  Judiciary Committee, worked on as we  moved  to  reauthorize  the  Voting  Rights legislation in the last session.  And just to bring to the attention of  my colleagues, the reason why that is  so important is because it seems that  race again is becoming a dividing issue  in America. And I just want to remind  my colleagues, or maybe bring it to  your attention, I am going to sort of  merge it into the review of the particular sessions that I had, but I just  want to announce to my colleagues  that Ward Connelly has managed to get  the question of affirmative action on  the ballot of nine States. My understanding is that that question which  revolves around race will be on the  Presidential-year elections.  It  is my  understanding that it will be on the  ballot in November of 2008. I am going  to investigate that issue, but I wanted  to just bring that to the table because  a number of our sessions had to do with  trying to grapple with this question of  race. And certainly the Voting Rights  Act and the interpretations that the  Supreme Court will make on additional  cases involving race really emphasize  that.  And I must say that I enjoyed co-  hosting a series of sessions with BOBBY  SCOTT. There was a session that, although I was detained, I was able to  get in for a brief moment, but I want to  compliment him and acknowledge that  one of the aspects that was spoken  about was the recent decision dealing  with race in schools on the Supreme  Court. So you can imagine if there are  ballot issues dealing with affirmative  action, it just converges on a number  of these issues. And that session really  emphasized the wrongness of the decision as it relates to the results, meaning that Brown versus Board of Education might be challenged under that  decision. Something for us to be concerned about.  So I enjoyed participating  in that  one and thought it was a very important,  instructive session, as well as  cochairing  the child welfare  section  with DANNYDAVIS. And the one point I  want to mention that came out of that  that really cries out for legislation is  the fact that foster children age out of  protection, age out of a home at age 18.  And for those of us who have children  that know that we are still mothering  them at 21, 22, 23, 24, and they have a  home, our children can come back to a  home or have a roof over their head  that we may have, but foster children  get out of the system. There is no obligation to provide them with housing or  schooling or anything. What a tragedy,  which is why you see that many foster  children are homeless, many  foster  children can’t finish college. They get  no stipend, and it is a crisis. And it was  an outstanding series with Historically  Black Colleges.  Let me then indicate that the series  that I had involved the energy brain  trust, which was historic. And let me  quickly say that we had representatives from Shell and CAMAC energy  and  the CEO of CITGO;  from Venezuela, the Venezuelan ambassador; the  ambassador  from  Algeria;  Milton  Scott, who owns a very important African American energy company; Steve  Hightower, African American, owner of  an energy company; George Person;  Lisa Jackson; Gary Heminger; Hugh  Depland  from BP; Gary  from Marathon; Frank Stewart from the American Association of Blacks in Energy;  Willie Trotty. And the key element,  high gasoline prices and high utility  costs, building bridges. We have a commitment to convene the energy brain  trust at the OTC, the Offshore Technology Conference, in Houston, but the  main thing we have a commitment to  is getting African Americans  in the  ownership wealth part of energy and  making sure that there are African  Americans in the corporate aspects of  these major Fortune  500  companies  and, as well, increasing more ownership.  b2030  Lastly, we did a provocative session  on hip hop, ‘‘The Culture of a People,  the Language of a People,’’ and it actually  got  people  talking.  Julianne  Malveaux,  the president of Bennett  College. Azim Rashid, senior VP of operations at Warner Music. J. Xavier,  350-time performer, 15-year-old clean  hip hop artist. An Tun Muhammad, the  president of The Real Hip Hop Network. Asha Jenning,  Igniting Media  Accountability. Madhatter of the Box  Station in Houston, and JMAC. And  then Reverend Ben Chavis and Charles  LeBoef.  Let me conclude by saying that we  opened up the door of communication  to understand hip hop from both perspectives  in art, but also accountability. I look forward to continuing  those sessions.

2329,31,2007-10-01,Mrs. BLACKBURN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from Georgia so  very much. We have started our new  fiscal year, and the new majority was  not able to get one single spending bill  to the President’s desk, so we do operate on a continuing resolution.  Mr. Speaker, as I said, some of us  who want to reduce what the Federal  Government spends, holding the spending at last year’s level is not such a  bad idea. We kind of like doing that.  But for a new majority who said we are  going to have transparency and openness, to come in and continue to spend  more and more and more, not less, but  more. More of the taxpayers’ money,  putting more of it into earmarks.  The gentleman referenced the cq.com  article which referenced 7,000 earmarks  in eight bills; 5,670 of those earmarks  with a combined worth of $4.2 billion  linked to individual House Members.  And the concern with that, as my constituent said, how much you spend and  how you spend it and concern over the  earmarks.  You know, we have seen quite a bit of  hypocrisy from the new leadership. As  the gentleman from Georgia said, we  do have House Resolution 479. This is  something people can go on and pull up  on the Internet and take a look at it.  We are trying to get that voted on,  forcing the transparency issue and restoring those rules that we passed last  year to make certain that an individual’s name is there, that you can find  what individuals are earmarking, not  trying to hide this, but you can find it  and know who is asking for what in  that budget.  We have 193 signatures on the discharge petition so we can force it out  of committee, force it to the floor, and  force a debate for the American people  so they know what is going to be spent  here in the House.  I encourage our Members to take a  look at that legislation and to come  join us on this first day of the new fiscal year. Again, I encourage our colleagues from the other side of the aisle  to embrace the issue of reducing what  the Federal Government spends, to emFOXX VIRGINIA brace transparency in these earmarks,  and to work for earmark reform, to  join us in continuing to work for earmark reform.  Mr. Speaker, I want to yield to Dr.  from North Carolina  who certainly has conservative credentials and understands so very clearly  how to work with earmarks, how to  work with Federal budgeting and making certain that we remain true to our  conservative principles as we address  our Federal budget issues.  ",2007
2330,31,2007-10-01,Ms. FOXX.," I am very grateful to you,  Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mr. HENSARLINGand  ",2007
2331,31,2007-10-01,Mr. PRICE.," I was enjoying listening to  you all speak about this issue and helping to educate the American people  about what we are dealing with here,  particularly as it relates to the numbers that Congressman HENSARLING is  so good at doing.  It probably won’t surprise anybody  that a September Gallup Poll revealed  that Americans’ trust in the Federal  Government is at a low ebb. Today,  most Americans trust the Federal Government less than they did during the  Watergate scandal. At the same time, a  new Reuter’s poll found that Congress  has an all-time low approval rating of  11 percent.  I am extraordinarily proud to represent the Fifth Congressional District  of North Carolina in the Congress. I am  not proud that is the way that Americans feel, though, about the Congress  of the United States. I think there are  many reasons that people feel that way  about the Congress. I think that one of  the main reasons that people feel that  way is because last year the Democrats  who ran for office and who became the  new majority in this Congress after 12  years made a lot of promises.  Republicans were not perfect in the  12 years they were in control of the  Congress. Lots of mistakes were made.  Republicans, some Republicans, forgot  their way, lost their way and strayed  from the conservative principles that  got them into the majority.  Democrats promised they would be  different. They would run the most bipartisan, most  fiscally  conservative  Congress that had ever been seen. They  promised lots and lots of things, and  they have broken all of those promises.  That’s why I think that the attitude  toward the American people is so negative toward the Congress these days.  They are disappointed.  You know, as children we are brought  up to believe the promises that are  made to us. I think one of the greatest  disappointments people have is when  they are promised something, particularly by  their elected officials, and  then the elected officials break those  promises. I think that is what has happened.  What we are seeing here  is, time  after time, things that the Democrats  said in the campaign last year, they  have gone back on. I am going to give  one quote here from Speaker PELOSI  from 9–16–06 at a news conference: ‘‘We  have to have the fullest possible disclosure, and it has to be on earmarks in  appropriations,  in authorizations and  in taxation. And it has to be across the  board, with no escape hatches.’’  In fact, what has happened is the Republicans had to take the Democrats  kicking and screaming into revealing  what their earmarks were. In fact, I  was here on the floor with an amendment on the floor for 22 hours back in  June when we were dealing with the  homeland security bill to say to the  Democrats: It is time you lived up to  your promise. You’ve got to disclose  these earmarks.  They had planned not to disclose any  of those earmarks until after the bills  were passed, and then they were going  to publish them in the month of August and let people try to figure out  where the earmarks were. So I think,  again, a major part of the problem that  we are having with the attitude of the  American people towards Congress is  they are disappointed in us.  Republicans last year passed legislation that made all of our earmarks  transparent. There are differences of  opinion on whether we should have earmarks or not. I think the Constitution  gives us not just the right but the responsibility to spend money the way  we think it should be spent through the  Congress. That  is our responsibility.  However, everything should be transparent. Everything should be out there.  If I ask for special project money, I  should be proud enough of that money  to say where it is going. But not everybody wants to do that. What the Democrats have done is they have hidden  their earmarks in legislation. We finally were able to force them into revealing  earmarks  in  appropriations  bills, but not even in all appropriations  bills have they disclosed them.  Reference has been made tonight to  earmarks in the SCHIP bill last week.  Every time a bill passes this House  practically, we find there are earmarks  buried in those bills written in such a  way it is very difficult to discern where  those earmarks are.  Republicans don’t believe in that. We  believe if you are going to have earmarks, they need to be transparent,  and I think that is the direction in  which we should be going. And I believe  doing that will help the American people feel better toward what the Congress is doing, and we need to build  trust with  the American people  in  order for us to be able to do the work  we need to do.  But what the Democrats have been  doing is trading earmarks for votes.  Again,  it seems  impossible to think  that with the majority they have they  would need to do that, but they have  been doing it. What they are doing is  taking taxpayer money, money that we  confiscate from the taxpayers of this  country, and then spend it on projects  that we think are projects that should  be funded. We don’t need to be doing  that, and we particularly don’t need to  be doing that unless we are willing to  show exactly where we are doing it.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.  ",2007
2333,52,2007-10-01,Mr. LIEBERMAN.," Mr. President, I  extend my  time  to  respond  to  two  things my friend from Alabama, Senator SESSIONS—one of my two friends  from Alabama, Senator SESSIONS, mentioned.  The first is the good news from the  Missile Defense Program of the successful test last Friday. We wish we did  not have to spend money building a  missile defense, but the truth is that  the number of powers, including a lot  of hostile anti-American countries that  have the capacity to fire missiles at us  and our allies, carrying both conventional weapons and potentially weapons of mass destruction, is increasing  and has increased.  The creation of  this program has  been controversial. The funding of it is  controversial. But  I believe,  just as  deeply as anyone can believe anything,  that we will, particularly as we hear  the success of the testing, look back on  the investments we have made in this  program and be very thankful we did it  because it will protect the security of  the United States from attack via a  missile from the enemies that exist to  our country and to our values.  I wish to just briefly echo what Senator SESSIONSsaid about General Pace,  who has just ended his time as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I put  an extensive statement in the RECORD  last week without being on the floor. I  just say now that this is a good man, a  patriot who has  served his country  with a tremendous sense of excellence,  of bravery, of honor, taking on risks  and burdens to himself for the defense  of America.  When he was appointed and  confirmed as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff, there were two pieces of history, two firsts. We are a country that  loves  firsts because when people do  something for the first time, it talks  about the increasing openness, the reality of what we call the American  dream. The one that was greatly commented on was Peter Pace was the first  marine  to become Chairman of  the  Joint Chiefs of Staff. That was a historic  first. The  other—perhaps  less  commented on but a great story of  America—Pete  Pace was  the  first  Italian American to be Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff—yet another extraordinary accomplishment and act of  service to our country from its Italian-  American community.  Pete Pace served during a difficult  time. He served with honor and integrity. He was intensely devoted to the  men and women who serve all of us,  and their families. He has maintained  the fighting edge of our military going  through a very difficult time, oversaw  two extraordinary victories in Afghanistan and Iraq and then the post-Saddam war increasingly against al-Qaida  in Iran and Iraq—very difficult times.  But he leaves office now at a moment  when, obviously thanks to the skill and  bravery  of  the American military,  there are some reasons for encouragement in Iraq, good reasons.  I thank General Pace, his wife, and  his family for their service to America.  We wish them well in the years ahead.  AMENDMENTNO. 3058  Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the amendment offered by Senator KENNEDY and Senator MIKULSKI  and others,  including myself, which  will be voted on  later  today. This  amendment would bring  some  commonsense reforms to the process by  which  agencies  decide  whether  to  outsource Federal jobs to contractors.  Sometimes, obviously, it makes a lot  of sense for agencies to turn to contractors because they are able to perform certain functions more efficiently  than the agencies could themselves.  That is in everybody’s interest, including the taxpayers’. However, in many  cases, experience has shown Federal  employees can perform the work just  as efficiently or more efficiently than  the contractors and deserve the right  to bid when work is proposed to be  outsourced.  Additionally,  agencies  must ensure that  inherently governmental work—in other words, work  which is intimately related to the public interest—is performed by Federal  employees and not by private contractors. That is why the Government was  created.  The process  for deciding when  to  outsource jobs has to be a careful one,  it has to be fair to contractors, and it  has to be fair to Federal employees. Of  course, it has to be fair, most of all, to  America’s taxpayers.  The Kennedy amendment provides  Federal employees the same right contractors currently possess  to appeal  outsourcing decisions. In other words,  when a particular function is proposed  for outsourcing, open to bidding by private contractors, there is a process—  and a good one—that has been created  where Federal employees themselves  may bid against those contractors for  that outsourcing work. What the Kennedy amendment says is Federal employees should have the same rights  contractors have to appeal outsourcing  decisions. Why  just have one of the  competitors for the outsourcing have  the right to appeal and the other one  does not? To me, that is simply a fundamental issue of fairness.  The amendment also contains a provision to ensure that contractors competing for Department of Defense work  do not receive an unfair advantage because they offer inferior health or retirement benefits to what we are offering to Federal employees.  I do not  think any Member of this Chamber  would want employees of the Department of Defense to be at a disadvantage in competing for their jobs because they receive health and retirement benefits that we authorize and  ordain from the Federal Government.  This amendment also addresses a  concern I have had for quite a long  time; that is, it sometimes appears as  if the Office of Management and Budget pushes agencies to meet arbitrary  numerical targets for the outsourcing  of  jobs.  Decisions  on  outsourcing  should be made on a case-by-case basis  where it makes sense for agencies to  outsource the jobs as opposed to giving  them a quota of outsourcing and say  they have to hit that quota.  Arbitrary numerical targets,  I am  afraid, take agencies off the path of  pursuing other means of cutting costs.  They overtax agencies already struggling to monitor work performed by  contractors. I believe they sometimes,  without  cause, undermine  the  civil  service, which we ought to be elevating  as it is elevated in so many of the  other industrialized developed democracies. Those types of numerical targets were prohibited by Congress in the  fiscal year 2003 Omnibus appropriations  bill, but the Office of Management and  Budget seems to be continuing to pressure agencies to conduct competitions  between Federal employees and contractors on a certain number of jobs  each year. That  is not  right. The  amendment before us makes clear that  use of such quotas at the Department  of Defense is impermissible.  These are all, in my opinion, sensible, modest reforms. They do not and  they are not intended to prohibit the  outsourcing of Federal jobs, which I  support when it makes sense, but, rather, ensure that the process is objective,  fair. It essentially puts both parties  here on a level playing field.  The core provisions of this amendment have, in fact, received bipartisan  support in the Senate over the last few  years. I hope we can continue that support when the amendment comes to the  vote today.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DURBIN). The Senator from Vermont.

2338,66,2007-10-01,Mr. NELSON  of Florida.," Madam  President, if I may be recognized, I will  use these remarks to tell the Senate  that it has been a pleasure to work  with the chairman of the  full committee, Senator LEVIN, who has consistently given this Senator free rein  as the chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee.  What it looked like last winter was  that all the thorny issues of nuclear  weapons  and  the  follow-on  nuclear  weapons and the question of national  missile defense, the strategic posture  of the United States, would get us all  wound up around the axle. But it didn’t  turn out that way, and I want to give  credit to my colleague, Senator SESSIONS, the ranking member of our subcommittee, for working with me and  the members of the committee in resolving these issues. What we worked  out in subcommittee, basically, is what  is in the bill.  Although the administration would  like to go ahead and start building national missile defense sites in Eastern  Europe, the fact is, they haven’t even  worked it out with the countries involved in Eastern Europe. So what we  did was we put a  fence around any  funding other than the acquisition and  the preparation of the land for such a  site.  At the end of the day, there is going  to have to be continued research and  development should the need arise for  locating those missiles in Eastern Europe because they are not the same  version that is in the silos in Alaska.  That is a three-stage version; this is a  two-stage version. And it is not the  same missile or rocket; therefore, it  has to go through all of its subsequent  testing.  Now, General Obering just had a successful test a couple of days ago, and  for that we want to congratulate him,  but if the threat is the Shahab missile  from Iran shooting into Europe or into  the United States with a nuclear weapon on top of the rocket, if that is the  reason to have national missile defense  in Eastern Europe, well, we just simply  don’t know that Iran is going to have  that capability. And as we continue to  look at this on down the road, that is  going to be an evaluation as to whether  at the end of the day we are going to  need that national missile defense in  Eastern Europe. But since we don’t  know all those answers, we have provided in this bill that if they concluded  the agreement with those Eastern European countries, they can go about  the process of acquiring the land, the  site, and the preparation of the site.  We also noted in our committee that  they have not had tremendous success  with the airborne laser, and of the approximately $.5 billion that they wanted to continue that program, we cut  that program by $200 billion and used  that money elsewhere, in kinetic energy intercepts on the boost phase of  an intercontinental ballistic missile.  So those are just some of the things  in here, and I want to thank all the  parties who worked with us to get a bipartisan resolution, which is the way a  Defense bill ought to be managed and  ought to be passed, and we have that  this year, and I am very grateful.  Now, there is another part in here  that Senator LEVIN and the ranking  member  of  the  full  committee  approved, and I want to thank him for  that. That is the question of widows  and orphans. Current  law  is that a  servicemember pays for survivors benefits. They pay once they retire, and  they pay for that benefit. It is like an  insurance policy. On the other hand,  there is another body of law in the Veterans’ Administration where there are  survivors benefits for widows and orphans. When the servicemember passes  away,  those  two  eligibilities, under  current law, cancel out each other, and  that is not the way we ought to be  treating widows and orphans.  It was no less than President Lincoln  who said, in his second inaugural address, that the mark of a country is  how it treats the victims of war, the  widows and orphans. And taking care  of the widows and orphans, in fact, is a  cost of defense. It is a cost of doing  business in defense. Just like you buy  tanks and airplanes and guns and materiel, and so forth, taking care of not  only the veterans is a cost of war, but  taking care of their survivors is a cost  of war too. This Nation has long canceled out those two eligibilities, and it  is time for us to change this.  Because we were down at the end of  our discussion of this bill last week, I  did not ask for a rollcall vote, as I had  last year. Of course, the rollcall was  something like 95 to 3 in favor of the  widows and orphans, and we would  have gotten some kind of a vote like  that again. I was trying to accommodate my chairman and  the  ranking  member in the crush of business, and  they were kind enough to put it into  the managers’ package. So this will become a conference item, where it is always a question about money. A few  years ago  it was estimated  that  it  would cost an additional $9 billion over  10 years. That is now down to somewhere in the range of about $7 billion  or $8 billion over 10 years. So when we  get  into  the  conference  committee,  this Senator is going to try to find how  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:10 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S01OC7.REC S01OC7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007
2339,73,2007-10-01,Mr. SHELBY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to pay tribute to Mayer Mitchell, a great American and human being  who passed away on Wednesday, September 26, 2007. A highly successful  businessman and  remarkable philanthropist, Mayer Mitchell was a personal friend, and along with the entire  city of Mobile, I mourn his passing.  Mayer was born in New Orleans in  1933 and grew up in Mobile, AL. He  earned his bachelor of science degree in  economics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance  in 1953. He then served as an Army first  lieutenant  in Korea, earning a commendation ribbon with medal pendant  for meritorious service.  Returning home to Mobile with his  wife Arlene  in 1958, Mayer  founded,  with his brother Abe,  the Mitchell  Company, a commercial and residential real estate development firm. He  went on to serve as its chairman and  chief executive officer  for  the next  three decades, selling his interest in  the Mitchell Company in 1986.  The company’s final total under the  oversight of the Mitchell brothers was  remarkable, with 25,000 single family  homes, 20,000 apartments and 175 shopping  centers  built  throughout  the  Southeast.  In fact, the current Mitchell Company that descended from a partnership of Mayer and his brother remains  the largest private firm in Mobile and  is  among  the  top  40  in Alabama.  Mayer’s business success earned him an  induction into the Alabama Business  Hall of Fame in 2006.  Mayer Mitchell  leaves a  legacy of  tremendous philanthropy, touching the  lives of many residents of south Alabama. Mayer was a tireless proponent  of education and health care, serving  more than 32 years on the University of  South Alabama’s Board of Trustees, including a term as chairman.  He was awarded the University of  South Alabama’s National Alumni Association Distinguished Service Award  in 2005 and an honorary doctorate of  humane letters in 2007.  The Mitchell  family’s philanthropy  reached all aspects of the campus at  the University of South Alabama, from  business and medicine  to athletics.  Mayer will forever be remembered as a  legendary figure in the growth of the  University. The Mitchell Cancer Institute, the Mitchell College of Business  and the Mitchell Center sports and performance complex, proudly bear the  family name.  To date, the Mitchell family holds  the distinction of having contributed  more than any other single family to a  public university in Alabama State history.  The Mitchell Cancer Institute alone  is a powerful legacy, providing state-  of-the-art  cancer  care  to  people  throughout  the  gulf  coast  region.  Mayer always explained his deep commitment to cancer treatment through  a personal connection. At the age of 36,  he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease and was given 6 months to live.  After  2 years of  treatments, Mayer  made an extraordinary recovery.  This victory not only shaped his life,  but shaped the future of the Mobile region as well. He never forgot that he  had to leave Mobile for his own cancer  treatment  in Rochester, NY, and he  vowed to make certain Mobile had its  own cancer center in the future.  This experience shaped his generosity  and will to persevere in the form of improved quality of health care for every  resident in south Alabama.  Although Mayer Mitchell and his  family were critical to the tremendous  growth of the University of South Alabama, this was not the only object of  Mayer’s patronage.  A strong friend to Israel, he served a  term as president of  the American  Israeli Public Affairs Committee and  served on the board of the Washington  Institute for Near East Policy and the  Jewish Seminary of America, which  awarded him an honorary doctorate.  Mayer  supported  several  other  schools and numerous social and religious organizations. His philanthropic  service  included work with Alabama  Power  Company,  Wright  School,  Bishop State Community College, Leukemia Society of America, USA Foundation, AmSouth Bank, Altus Bank,  Mobile Area United Way, Mobile Area  Chamber of Commerce, Mobile Jewish  Welfare Fund, Mobile Federation of  Jewish Charities, Mobile County Real  Estate Association, Archives of American Art, Anti-Defamation League and  the Banc Corporation.  His honors include: Jewish Welfare  Fund Man of the Year, Outstanding  Young Men of America, Prichard Honorary Citizen of the Year, Mobile County Realtor of the Year, and numerous  high honors from the Boy’s Club of Mobile, Bishop State Community College,  University of Rochester, New Orleans  Chapter of Hadassah, Alabama Institute  for the Deaf and Blind, Mobile  Kiwanis Club and the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association.  Mayer is loved and will be missed by  his wife of 54 years, Arlene; his son  Richard; his three daughters, Melinda  Wertheim,  Joy Grodnick  and Lisa  Bukstein; and eight grandchildren.  He was an inspiration to many and  will be remembered for his dedication  and many contributions to Mobile and  the University of South Alabama.  I ask the entire Senate to join me in  recognizing and honoring the  life of  Mayer Mitchell.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.  ",2007

2341,73,2007-10-01,Mr.  SESSIONS.," Mr. President,  I  thank my colleague Senator SHELBY  for recalling the remarkable facts of  the life of Mayer Bubba Mitchell, one  of Mobile’s great citizens, a national  leader, as well as a local leader, someone who has  friends throughout the  country and the world. It is remarkable, the extent of his reach and impact. He had a clear vision. He wanted  his life to be a life that made the world  a better place. He worked at that. He  had a strong will to do that. Senator  SHELBYand I were talking about that  this morning. It was remarkable. He  had an ability to get things accomplished. To me, one of his most remarkable characteristics was the fact  that he could have many different activities going on, but he always seemed  to complete each one of them and get  it done successfully.  At a  final AIPAC banquet he attended, realizing it would be his last—  it was recalled at his funeral service  Friday—he asked these questions about  himself but really applying to others. I  think it would apply to all of us in the  Senate. Knowing that he would not be  back, he asked: Have I done enough?  Have I done my best? Have I made a  difference? All of us ought to ask those  questions more and would probably be  better performers when we do.  His wonderful partner Arlene is such  a  fabulous person,  so well  liked, a  former Mobilian of the year. She is so  gracious. His  son Richard  spoke  so  movingly at his memorial service. His  son-in-law Jimmy Grodnick likewise,  married to his wonderful daughter Joy,  made remarks. His grandchildren read  from the Talmud such wonderful passages  that  reflected his values. His  brother Abe, who has been a partner in  business and in so many of these activities, told me afterwards it wasn’t  over. He still had things he wanted to  do and he would continue to work at  them.  I know that  is exactly what  Mayer would have liked.  The business school I visited at the  University of South Alabama is so well  endowed by the Mitchell family. The  athletics center, the Mitchell Center,  is where his memorial service was held,  the sports complex. And perhaps in the  long term, the greatest financial investment he and his family made is in  the Mitchell Cancer Center that will be  a place for research as well as treatment of those who have suffered with  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:10 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S01OC7.REC S01OC7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007
2342,80,2007-10-01,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased today to  join my colleague,  Senator MURRAY, in introducing legislation—the Facilitating Outstanding  Classrooms  Using  Size  Reduction  (FOCUS) Act of 2007—that will provide  $2 billion in funding to help, States and  school districts hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size, particularly in  the early grades.  When a teacher is responsible for a  classroom of 25, 30, or more students,  how can we expect each student to receive enough time and attention? One  pillar of our education system should  be small classes. The body of research  around  class  size  has  consistently  shown  that  smaller classes  improve  student performance, including reading  and mathematics, in the early grades  as well as in subsequent years when  students are placed in larger classes.  Research also shows that at the end of  fifth grade, students who were in small  classes  in  first through third grades  were about half a school year ahead of  students from larger classes in all core  subjects—reading, language arts, math,  and science. Additionally, studies have  found that students from small classes  earn better grades in high school, take  more advanced courses, and are more  likely to take college-entrance exams.  They are also more likely to graduate  from high school than students in larger classes.  Small classes also enable teachers to  teach better. Any teacher will tell you  that small classes make a difference.  Small classes allow teachers to spend  more time on instruction, get to know  their students better, spend less time  on discipline problems, and better identify students who need individually tailored assistance. The difference between teaching large classes and teaching small classes  is substantial, and  the pedagogy required for each differs.  I have stood with Senator MURRAYon  previous legislation to reduce class size  in our Nation’s schools, and I am proud  to stand with her again today in support of a class size reduction bill. The  bill we offer today strengthens our earlier efforts to reduce class size. First—  the FOCUS Act would provide a dedicated funding stream for class size reduction. The No Child Left Behind Act  incorporated the Class Size Reduction  Program into title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  The Murray-Biden FOCUS Act would  create a separate  funding stream  in  title V for the class size reduction initiative—ensuring that efforts to reduce  class size would not have to compete  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:10 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S01OC7.REC S01OC7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007

2351,101,2007-10-01,Mrs. DAVIS of California.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  today  in support of  the Psoriasis and  Psoriatic Arthritis Research, Cure, and Care  Act, H.R. 1188 and  to encourage my colleagues to lend their support.  According  to  the National  Institutes  of  Health (NIH) as many as 7.5 million Americans are affected by psoriasis—a chronic, inflammatory, painful, disfiguring and disabling  disease  for which  there  is  limited  treatment  and no cure. Ten to thirty percent of people  with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis,  which causes pain, stiffness and swelling  in  and around the joints. On average, there are  17,000 people living with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in each congressional district.  Cristy Boisvert is one constituent in my district living with psoriasis. Cristy was diagnosed  with psoriasis when she was six months old.  Growing up with psoriasis was difficult. Her  mother spent countless nights applying medication  to her scalp,  followed by countless  mornings washing the greasy mess out of her  hair before school.  In junior high, Cristy played on the basketball team. One day she wore shorts to practice,  which  revealed  the  flaky  psoriasis  plaques on her legs. Her friends stood around  making fun of her. They called her ‘‘Fungi’’ because  they said  it  looked  like mushrooms  were growing on her legs. You can only imagine how much those words hurt her.  When Cristy was 20, she began  to  think  about whether she wanted to have children.  She reflected back on all of the grief that living  with psoriasis  caused her and questioned  whether she wanted to take the risk of passing  that down to another human being.  Cristy is now in her 30s, and she is ecstatic  about the fact that she can do something positive about psoriasis. As an active member of  the National Psoriasis Foundation,  she  is  working to ensure that young people in the future will not have to endure the same ridicule  that she did.

Madam Speaker, it is a real pleasure  today  to be here  to  recognize  the  achievement of the Warner Robins Little League team in winning the Little  League World Series. An awful lot of  people in Congress, including myself,  watch those games, and it was a joy to  do so and sort of relive my childhood,  since baseball was my sport when I was  a kid.  I couldn’t play baseball  like  those kids play baseball, but I still  played baseball. It is truly the national  pastime, and I would say to the kids  that were so successful at this particular venture, and all other kids that  play sports, that sports are a very important thing in your lives and you  should try and do as well as you can  when you’re playing a game, be good  sports, recognize that you’re not always going to win, certainly treat the  losers as the Warner Robins team did  the Tokyo team, and then carry that  same sort of spirit throughout our life,  the same kind of drive, the interest in  perfection, the commitment to doing  your absolute best, and apply that in  your school work, in the work that you  eventually engage in as your vocation.  Don’t get fixated on sports. Sports is  a great, great thing for kids, and all  kids should play sports. Don’t be couch  potatoes. Don’t be just sitting there in  front of a computer and playing computer games. Play sports, stay healthy,  but then take what you learn on the  field and apply it every single day. If  you do that, you will wind up being  successful in life.  Madam Speaker, I would like to basically read the resolution. It congratulates the Warner Robins Little League  baseball  team  from Warner Robins,  Georgia, in my district, on winning the  2007 Little League World Series Championship. This occurred on August 26,  2007, when the Warner Robins Little  League team defeated the Tokyo Little  League team by a score of 3–2 in a very  exciting game.  Madam Speaker, I want to specifically congratulate the team players:  Hunt  Smith;  Taylor  Lay;  David  Umphreyville, Jr.; Nick Martens; Zane  Conlon; Micah Wells; Dalton Carriker;  Kendall Scott; Clint Wynn; Payton  Purvis; Hunter Jackson; and Keaton  Allen; and also the Manager, Mickey  Lay; Coach, Mike Smith; Team Mother, Robin Smith; and President, Roman  Jones.  I want to congratulate also the parents. It is an awfully big commitment  for parents to make to see your kids  through these kinds of athletic activities. Very, very few kids get to have  the experience of winning a championship like this, but all kids are benefited  from participating in sports.  Madam Speaker, the resolution goes  on to resolve that the House of Representatives congratulates the Warner  Robins Little League baseball  team  from Warner Robins, Georgia, on winning the 2007 Little League World Series Championship, and respectfully requests that the Clerk of the House  transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the City of Warner Robins  and to each player, manager and coach  of the Warner Robins Little League  baseball team.  To the extent that the Clerk needs  help doing that, I am happy to offer my  assistance.  ",2007
2363,8,2007-10-09,Mr. SOUDER.," Madam Speaker,  I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge  passage of this resolution to congratulate the Warner Robins, Georgia, All  Stars  for winning the Little League  World Championship in August in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The achievements on the  field, Dalton Carriker  smacked a 2–1 curve ball from Junsho  Kiuchi of Japan over the right field  wall to give the Georgia team a 3–2  walk-off  victory  before  31,000  fans,  were, of course, remarkable.  Madam  Speaker,  what  happened  right after that was even more remarkable and speaks even higher of the  players and coaches involved in this  great  victory.  In  fact,  these  boys  taught a lesson that we here in Washington would do well to consider. When  the Georgia boys  saw  the Japanese  boys slump to the ground in defeat,  they rushed to their sides, gave them  hugs and physically and emotionally  lifted their spirits. They knew the Japanese players were opponents, not enemies. They knew that good, worthy  opponents are a blessing. Without opponents who push us, we never put  forth our best effort, and our victories  are empty and meaningless and trite.  The winning  pitcher  for Georgia,  Kendall Scott, summed it up best as to  why his team reacted as it did, and, little did he know, why programs such as  Little League and other youth sports  are so valuable to the character of  America’s  youth:  ‘‘They  don’t  disrespect,’’ Scott said.  ‘‘They are very  disciplined, and they are some of the  nicest kids you’ll ever meet. Just seeing them fall down and cry, you just  couldn’t let them do that. You gotta  pick them up.’’  Madam Speaker, when these young  men write their  ‘‘What I did on my  summer  vacation’’  essays  this  fall,  they will have a dazzling story to tell.  They took on the world and won. But,  better yet, they taught the world a lesson, that victories can come after the  game as well as during it.

2364,15,2007-10-09,Mr. PASTOR.," Madam Speaker.  It  is with  great pleasure that I rise today to congratulate  the Phoenix Mercury on becoming the 2007  winner of  the Women’s National Basketball  Association Championship on September 16,  2007, in the final game of a five-game series  that Phoenix won by an  impressive 108–92  score.  This is the first championship for the Phoenix Mercury, and the first title won by a road  team in the league’s history. The event also  places the Mercury Coach, Paul Westhead, in  the unique position of being the first coach to  ever lead a team to a championship in both  the National Basketball Association and  the  WNBA courts.  The WNBA started 11 years ago. Since that  time, its fan base has continued to grow each  year as more and more sports enthusiasts  have become appreciative of the athletic talents of women. This year’s victory game, in  which the Mercury posted a 73.3 shooting percentage in the first quarter, clearly shows that  women have rightfully earned a spot  in  the  limelight of this sport.  The magic events of  the September 16th  game created an  impressive run of records  that are truly deserving of recognition. Therefore, I am very proud of to have sponsored  this resolution honoring the Phoenix Mercury,  a superb team that has combined hard-work,  sportsmanship, raw  talent, and a will  to win  into a modern day success story—a success  that was aided by great coaching and a strong  front office organization led by owner Robert  Sarver. I am most certainly wishing them all  the best as they continue to bring outstanding  basketball in the future to fans worldwide.  As Coach Westhead recently quoted when  referencing this victory and which serves as a  thoughtful reminder to all walks of life, ‘‘Isn’t it  amazing how much  can be accomplished  when no one cares who gets the credit?’’  ",2007

The text of the bill is as follows:  H.R. 814  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Children’s Gasoline Burn Prevention Act’’.  SEC. 2. CHILD-RESISTANT PORTABLE GASOLINE  CONTAINERS.  (a) CONSUMERPRODUCTSAFETYRULE.—The  provision of subsection (b) shall be considered to  be a consumer product safety rule issued by the  Consumer Product Safety Commission under  section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act  (15 U.S.C. 2058).

2372,15,2007-10-09,Mr. RUSH.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, this is the first of  four consumer protection bills on floor  of the House of Representatives that  the  Subcommittee  on  Commerce,  Trade and Consumer Protection  reported on July 30, and the Committee  on Energy and Commerce subsequently  reported on September 27.  The final versions of these bills have  all been crafted in a thoroughly bipartisan manner and in close consultation  with  the Consumer Product Safety  Commission. The committee staff, both  majority and minority, should be commended  for the hard work they put  into these bills to ensure that they are  thoughtful,  careful,  and  bipartisan  pieces of legislation.  H.R.  814,  the Children’s Gasoline  Burn Prevention Act, was introduced  by Congressman DENNISMOORE and  Congressman SPENCERBACHUS.  b1545  It  requires child-resistant caps on  gasoline cans, whether they are sold  with or without gasoline. Currently,  the law only requires such safety caps  on cans sold with gasoline in the can.  The absence of a requirement for child-  resistant caps on empty gasoline cans  makes no sense, and this bill addresses  this dangerous inconsistency.

2373,22,2007-10-09,Mr. STEARNS.," Mr. Speaker,  this  bill, the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool  and Spa Safety Act, as the chairman  mentioned,  simply  aims  to  prevent  tragic drowning and entrapment accidents that of course are entirely preventable with  the addition of  some  simple equipment at a modest cost, I  think we all agree. What we have here  I believe is significantly different and  significantly improved over what was  initially referred to our committee. So,  again, in a bipartisan fashion, I think  we’ve improved the bill. So I commend  the chairman for including some of the  modifications that we suggested and  some of the modifications that came  from his staff.  My colleagues, this  legislation has  two distinct components: one, it adopts  an industry standard on drain covers;  and two, it establishes a grant program  administered by the Commission designed to provide incentives to States  to change their State laws regarding  pool safety demands. These incentives,  through these grants, the States will  change their laws.  I  fully support the  intent of this  measure, and I will, therefore, support  the drain cover standard. I would like  to reiterate the concern I expressed  during consideration of the bill earlier,  that  of  turning  voluntary  industry  standards into commission rules. Without repeating what I said earlier on one  of the previous bills, I again simply  caution my colleagues about the unintended precedents our actions today  may put in place.  Further, I would like to express my  reservation about the pool safety grant  program and  its effect on a States’  rights to regulate property and safety  within its own borders. This piece of  Federal  legislation mandates  that  States adopt specific safety standards  and no other. Mr. Speaker, there are 38  States with pool safety laws on the  books today. None of these States, my  colleagues, including my home State of  Florida and the State of California,  probably the two States with the most  swimming pools and the most stringent  pool safety laws, will be eligible for the  $25 million in grant funds unless they  change their existing laws, making this  essentially a 12-State grant program.  The laws mandated by this legislation are overly prescriptive and may  even weaken the safety laws of some  States. Some of us may disagree on  this, but that’s what we could possibly  consider. Holding Federal tax dollars  over the heads of State lawmakers to  urge them to change in their States  their  laws  to a proscribed  standard  may not have any effect. We hope it  does. If a State opts to change its laws,  a change will unfortunately and indiscriminately raise the cost of compliance for all pool owners, regardless of  whether they have children or not.  I note that the Commission itself expressed concern about the grant program. The CPSC does not have experience in ministering any grant program,  and Mr. Speaker, it’s not staffed to do  so.  Now, notwithstanding those concerns  that I have just expressed, I voice my  support for this bill today and for its  author, DEBBIEWASSERMAN SCHULTZ,  who did a very strong, persevering job  on this. It came through committee  when I was chairman and we tried to  make changes.  I appreciate her patience, and  I  look  forward  to  supporting her, and I commend her for her  perseverance.  We are going to support the bill because  it will  undoubtedly  improve  swimming  pool  safety  by  requiring  that all drain covers sold in the United  States be made  in accordance with  standards to prevent entrapment. This  is very good. These horrific entrapment  accidents are entirely preventable. It is  my hope that this legislation will result in such prevention and avoidance.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

2376,22,2007-10-09,Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1721,  the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and  BOBBY Spa Safety Act. I want to particularly  thank  Chairman  RUSH,  the  chairman  of  the Subcommittee  on  Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection, and Chairman JOHNDINGELLof  the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for their incredible leadership  and support on this legislation.  Additionally, I would like to thank  Ranking Member BARTON, Congressman WOLFand Congressman RAMSTAD  for their steadfast support of this legislation, as well as Ranking Member  STEARNS, my fellow Floridian. I also  want to thank Safe Kids Worldwide for  always being such a wonderful resource  as this legislation became a reality.  On  June  15,  2002,  the  beautiful  Graeme Baker, whose picture  is  in  front of me, attended a pool party with  her entire family; her mother, Nancy,  and her four sisters. Everyone was having a great time swimming, when all of  a  sudden one of Nancy’s daughters  came running to tell her that Graeme  was in the spa. Nancy ran to the edge  of the spa, and all she saw was dark  and  bubbling water. Her  daughter,  frantically crying and pointing  into  the  tub,  insisted  that Graeme was  there. Nancy jumped into the spa and  saw Graeme with her eyes pinched  closed, her hair and limbs moving, with  the current of water from all the jets  on the side. Graeme was entrapped by  the powerful suction of the drain spa  and  could  not  free  herself. Nancy  pulled and pulled with all her strength  to help her daughter.  It eventually  took the strength of two adults to free  Graeme from the spa. Sadly, it was too  late; Graeme passed away in the hospital that afternoon.  Following Graeme’s  death, Nancy  and her father-in-law, former Secretary  of State James Baker, became and still  are  tireless advocates  for children’s  pool and spa safety.  When  I met Nancy,  I was  immediately taken by her tragic story of the  loss of her daughter. As a fellow mother of twins, I was most affected by Nancy’s  incredible desire to ensure that  what happened to Graeme did not happen to any other child. She has channeled all of her energy into raising the  issue of pool and spa safety to a national audience. Her passion is an inspiration to me, and I am proud to  sponsor this legislation in her daughter’s name.  The Baker family tragedy is a painful  example of the need for national pool  and spa safety legislation. We must implement national standards to replace  the haphazard safety measures that allowed Graeme, and hundreds of children like her, to be lost in such nightmare scenarios.  I am a mother of three young children, and I have talked about them on  the floor many times relating to various pieces of legislation. And as any  mother of young children will tell you,  supervision  does  lapse. Supervision,  when children are around water, is imperative. But as a mom of twins, as a  mom of a 4-year-old, I can tell you that  VerDate Aug 31 2005  02:55 Oct 10, 2007 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K09OC7.045 H09OCPT1 N C _ E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o l e o n c         ",2007

2378,29,2007-10-09,Ms. WATSON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  strong support of this resolution and  yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me  first  thank our colleague  from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) for introducing this important resolution. For  years,  the United Nations  has  attempted to reduce the potential  for  conflict on Cyprus and to heal and reunify that long-divided island.  Last year, Under Secretary of the  United Nations Ibrahim Gambari potentially made progress towards resolving this issue. Thanks to his efforts,  the Greek and Turkish Cypriots signed  an agreement on July 8, 2006, that sets  out principles forming the basis for a  future permanent agreement.  Mr. Speaker, these important principles include, first and foremost, recognition that the status quo, with a divided island, is unacceptable. They also  include a commitment to unification  based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation; a commitment to form intercommunal working groups aimed at achieving  confidence-building measures  to  improve daily lives on both sides of the  island; and a commitment to promote a  positive atmosphere that would allow  negotiations to thrive.  All of us hope that the July 8, 2006,  agreement between the Greek and the  Turkish  Cypriot  communities  will  prove to be an important step on the  road to reunification of Cyprus as a bizonal,  bicommunal  federation.  The  pace of the progress must accelerate.  To date, it has been, at best, halting.  But both parties have at least renewed  their pledge to work towards a negotiated agreement.  Mr. Speaker, U.N. Security Council  Resolution 1758 expresses full support  for the July 8, 2006, agreement. I hope  the Members of this body will reinforce  that message by backing this bill, and  thereby backing the unification of Cyprus. The resolution before us, H. Res.  405, expresses its support for the immediate  implementation of the July 8,  2006, agreement, and it calls on the administration to support it as well.  b1700  Mr. Speaker, the people of Cyprus deserve our encouragement and our support in their efforts to prepare for new  talks aimed at reunification, and that  is exactly what this resolution seeks to  do. I strongly support it, and I encourage my colleagues to do likewise.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
2379,29,2007-10-09,Mr. BILIRAKIS.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank  the gentlewoman from California for  her strong support of H. Res. 405. I rise  today to urge my colleagues to support  H. Res. 405, which expresses the strong  support of the U.S. House of Representatives for the immediate implementation of the July 8, 2006, United Nations-  brokered agreement between President  Papadopoulos of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot  community  leader, Mr.  Mehmet Ali Talat.  More than 33 years after the invasion  and occupation of Cyprus by Turkish  troops,  the country  remains divided  and has  the  longest  running peacekeeping  force  in the history of the  United Nations. It is important that  there is forward movement on properly  preparing the grounds for serious negotiations that will lead to sustainable  and lasting peace.  The  international  community  has  helped shepherd an agreement on a  process,  the Gambari  process,  that  points the way forward to comprehensive negotiations that will lead to the  reunification of the island, its people,  institutions and economy in a bi-zonal,  bi-communal federation.  The United Nations Security Council,  the European Union, and the United  States have all played key roles in trying to bring a lasting and fair resolution to the division of the island.  On July  8,  2006, President Papadopoulos and Mr. Talat agreed, under  the auspices of the United Nations, to  the establishment of technical committees and working groups to examine  the issues affecting the daily lives of  the Greek and Turkish Cypriot people,  as well as issues of substance.  H. Res. 405 recognizes the fact that  the status quo is unacceptable and that  its prolongation would have negative  consequences  for  the  Turkish  and  Greek Cypriots. It also reinforces the  proposition that a comprehensive settlement is both desirable and possible  and should not be further delayed.  In an effort to jump-start the July 8  agreement, President Papadopoulos invited Mr. Talat to a meeting that took  place this year on September 5. The  two leaders agreed on the need for the  earliest start of the Gambari process  and to continue their contact through  the U.N. and to meet again when appropriate.  As a member of the European Union,  the Republic of Cyprus has proven  itself a committed and influential partner in Europe. Despite its forced division, Cyprus’s  successful  social and  economic  integration  into the European Union is a testament to its focus  and dedication to democratic values  and regional cooperation.  In addition, Cyprus has a long history of working cooperatively with the  United  States  on  issues  of  international defense and security and continues to do so in the global war on terror. Cyprus is also a good friend to this  country. In the summer of 2006, Cyprus  served as the principal transit for 15,000  Americans  evacuating Lebanon. Our  citizens were provided with food, shelter, and medical care.  It is now time for Congress to demonstrate its strong support of efforts  toward the reunification of Cyprus by  passing H. Res. 405, calling for the immediate implementation of the July 8  agreement in its entirety and without  deviation from the process.  H. Res. 405 gives a strong message of  support for a reunified Cyprus under a  bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with  a  single  sovereignty,  single  international personality, and single citizenship with respect to human rights  and fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots.  I wish to thank Chairman LANTOS  and Ranking Member ROS-LEHTINEN  and all of my colleagues who have cosponsored H. Res. 405. I thank them for  recognizing what a significant step this  great representative body is taking by  telling the world community that the  sad  and  tragic  division  of Cyprus  should be no longer.

In the summer of 2006, we witnessed a major breakthrough  in the  troubled history of this divided island.  After years of conflict, both sides committed themselves to the reunification  of Cyprus based on a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation and political equality. By agreeing to these principles,  they recognize the status quo is unacceptable and that continuing it only  hurts both the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities.  In connection with this agreement,  we are all pleased to see the Cypriot  Government  take a number of confidence-building measures, demolishing  walls and even providing free health  care to Turkish Cypriots.  This summer, my family and I traveled to Cyprus and had the pleasure of  enjoying the legendary Cypriot hospitality. While I enjoyed the beauty and  serenity of  the  island,  I was most  struck by the openness and warmth of  the people there, who treated my family and me with the greatest regard. It  is cruel that such a warm and hospitable people should continue to be  subjected to this conflict.  We were simply appalled by the state  of the ‘‘green line’’ area. It is a blot on  an otherwise breathtaking country. It  is time that the Turkish troops remove  themselves from this island so that, at  our next visit, Cyprus will once again  be a peaceful and unified island free of  occupation.

BOWENJR., SPECIAL INSPECTORGENERALFOR IRAQRECONSTRUCTION, BEFORE UNITED STATES  THE HOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVESCOMMITTEEON  JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE CRIME,  THE ON TERRORISM, ANDHOMELANDSECURITY  WARPROFITEERINGANDOTHERCONTRACTOR  CRIMESCOMMITTEDOVERSEAS  (Tuesday, June 19, 2007, Washington, DC)  Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Forbes,  and members of the Subcommittee, thank  you  for  this opportunity  to address you  today on the work of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction.  To ensure accurate context, permit me to  outline several points essential to understanding the challenges of investigating and  prosecuting fraud in Iraq.  First, corruption within the Iraqi government, indeed within the fabric of Iraqi society,  is  a  serious  problem  that  inhibits  progress on many  fronts  in Iraq. This  is  widely recognized by the Government of Iraq  and the  international community.  In our  quarterly reports, SIGIR has called Iraq’s endemic corruption problem a ‘‘second insurgency.’’  I returned last month from my 16th trip to  Iraq and, during my visit, I met with the  Commissioner of Public Integrity, who heads  the institution created by the CPA to increase accountability for public corruption  in Iraq—and the President of the Board of  Supreme Audit, the analogue to the Government Accountability Office, which has existed in Iraq for many decades. The Iraqi  anti-corruption  authorities  again  emphasized to me the widespread nature of the  problem  of  corruption,  which  stretches  across the government, afflicting virtually  every ministry. And they outlined for me the  difficulties they face in implementing their  respective anti-corruption mandates.  The CPI Commissioner told me that he  currently has 2,000 cases involving $5 billion  in alleged corruption. And the President of  the Board of Supreme Audit has hundreds of  audits ongoing. In virtually every case, he is  uncovering a lack of accountability. Let me  emphasize that the CPI and the BSA oversee  Iraqi money—not U.S. money—that is missing or has been stolen from Iraqi programs.  During my visit, I was informed about political interference with the work of Iraqi investigators and prosecutors. For example, I  learned that Ministers and former Ministers  are exempt from prosecution unless the assent of the Prime Minister is obtained; and  each Minister  is entitled, under an  Iraqi  criminal code provision, to immunize selectively ministry employees from being held  accountable for corruption.  Iraq must make progress on rule of law enforcement,  in general, and corruption,  in  particular; political interference with fighting corruption remains a problem, undermining the effectiveness of the developing  rule of law system and consequently eroding  the Iraqi people’s confidence in their government.  Iraq is a sovereign state. The role of the  United States thus is to encourage the development of an efficient Iraqi justice system.  We do this for its own sake and for the sake  of maintaining and building upon the efforts  made, at great cost in blood and treasure, by  Americans and Iraqis since the liberation of  Iraq.  SIGIR’s specific role in this process has  been to review the effectiveness of United  States efforts to improve the rule of law system and to build up the corruption-fighting  capacity of the Iraqi government.  On July 28, 2006, SIGIR released a survey  on this subject and found that American efforts were funded at a very modest level,  given the scope of the problem, receiving  about $65 million (about three-tenths of 1  percent of our total reconstruction spending). My auditors found that American efforts have not been sufficiently coordinated  and focused and that more adequate leadership and organization was needed. The U.S.  Embassy has responded to some of these concerns since the review was released. SIGIR  will soon release another review on the issue,  updating our previous report.  SIGIR has a continuing investigative responsibility to detect and investigate malfeasance in American relief and reconstruction programs in Iraq. As part of this effort,  we have developed good working-level and  leadership-level relationships with the CPI  and the BSA. We coordinate with these Iraqi  agencies whenever we come across evidence  of potential wrongdoing by Iraqis. SIGIR, of  course, concentrates its law enforcement efforts on American targets and works with  the Department of Justice in their effective  prosecution.  My second point is that the incidence of  corruption within the U.S. reconstruction  program—judging from those cases that we  have uncovered thus  far—appears to constitute a relatively small component of the  overall American financial contribution to  Iraq’s reconstruction. Based on the work of  our 18 career investigators on SIGIR staff, I  believe that losses to American taxpayers  from fraud within reconstruction programs  will likely amount to a relatively small component of the overall investment in Iraq, totaling in the tens of millions (rather than  hundreds of millions or billions, as is sometimes imagined). However, the fact that the  fraud we have detected is relatively small (to  date) does not diminish the aggressiveness  with which SIGIR pursues allegations of  fraud in Iraq. We have found egregious incidents of fraud. And in partnership with the  Department of Justice, SIGIR has produced  clear results in prosecutions and convictions.  For example, in January, two individuals  were sentenced to prison as a result of SIGIR  investigations.  In early February,  indictments were announced of five more individuals, resulting  from SIGIR  investigations.  To date, SIGIR has opened over 300 cases,  and we have over 70 ongoing investigations.  Thirty-two of those cases are under prosecution at the Department of Justice.  We believe that the publicity our enforcement actions have received has helped to  deter misconduct in the U.S. reconstruction  program. And we also believe that enforcement will be an increasingly important part  of SIGIR’s mission over the next 18 months.  Moreover, in the course of this year, we expect to produce concrete investigative results as significant current cases come to  fruition.  SIGIR remains committed to a robust, deterrent presence in Iraq as long as our temporary organization exists. Today, I have  five investigators on the ground in Iraq investigating fraud. Although there are other  law enforcement agencies fighting fraud in  Iraq, SIGIR has maintained over the past 3  years the largest contingent of fraud investigators in Iraq. My investigators travel the  country under dangerous conditions, pursuing leads, interviewing witnesses, and piecing together evidence on a wide variety of  cases. Their work also takes them to other  countries in the region. Of note, SIGIR is  currently  reducing  its  overall  personnel  ‘‘footprint’’ in Baghdad in conjunction with  the reduction  in spending of appropriated  dollars on Iraq reconstruction.  One of the most important aspects of our  investigative efforts is the development of  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:22 Oct 10, 2007 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K09OC7.067 H09OCPT1 N C _ E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o l e o n c         ",2007

2386,43,2007-10-09,Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia.," Mr.  Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to my  friend and colleague, JOANNDAVIS,  who has served this body with dignity  and honor and dedication  since her  election in 2000.  I first met JOANNwhen she was running for the House of Delegates in 1997  and quickly became impressed with her  strong work ethic. Her congressional  district,  like mine,  is  the home of  many current and retired Federal employees. So when I became chairman of  the House Government Reform Committee, it was an easy decision to ask  her to oversee the Civil Service Subcommittee.  She took on the responsibilities of  subcommittee Chair with great diligence and energy. Through her efforts,  we made important strides in helping  the Federal Government recruit and retain quality employees. With her help,  we improved Federal student loan repayment programs and expanded dental and vision benefits. JOANNwas a  strong supporter of legislation allowing  retired Federal employees to deduct  health care premiums from pretax dollars, moving this important legislation  through her subcommittee. She was  also a reliable ally in the annual fight  for pay parity for civilian Federal employees.  Her district borders mine; we both  represent portions of Prince William  County. We have worked closely on a  number of local issues. With her passing, Northern Virginia and the Commonwealth have  lost a strong advocate.  I salute JOANNDAVIS for her courageous fight against cancer. Her passing  reminds us all that we need to fight  this horrible affliction.  My heartfelt condolences go out to  her husband, Chuck and to her sons,  Christopher and Charles. I hope they  find solace in knowing she did so much  to represent the people of Virginia.  ",2007
2387,43,2007-10-09,Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Missouri, the chairman of one of  the committees that JOANNserved on  and a past president of the weekly Congressional Prayer Breakfast (Mr. SKELTON).  ",2007
2388,43,2007-10-09,Mr. SKELTON.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Virginia for giving  me the opportunity to express my condolences to the JOANNDAVIS family,  her husband and two sons.  It’s always difficult to say good-bye  to a friend. And JOANNDAVISwas my  friend. She was my  colleague. We  served together on the Armed Services  Committee since she came to Congress.  She represented the First District of  Virginia, which had and has a strong  military tradition. She was preceded in  this Congress by my friend through the  years Herb Bateman.  She was a strong advocate for the  men and women in uniform, and she  will be  sorely missed  in  supporting  them as  the days  lie ahead. Shipbuilding was  the centerpiece of her  work because of the district she represented, and she understood and advocated the importance of shipbuilding  for the United States Navy. She was a  member,  actually  a  subcommittee  ranking member,  on  the Readiness  Subcommittee.  b1815  And it is interesting that we should,  this evening, point out that she fought  a disease with grace and dignity, and  that this is the Breast Cancer Awareness month, that I think we should  make note of.  She fought a tremendous fight. She  came back when she could, and our  heart was with her. She  fought the  good fight. But in looking back at my  friend, JOANNDAVIS, I remember her  most for her sense of humor, how we  would joke with one another and how  absolutely pleasant she was. Those are  attributes that people remember just  as much as they remember the good  work that she did as a Member of this  body. So I thank the gentleman from  Virginia for allowing me to say a word  or two about my friend, JOANNDAVIS.  ",2007

2390,43,2007-10-09,Mrs. DRAKE.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to honor our colleague and my  friend, JOANNDAVIS. I was honored to  have served with her in both the Virginia General Assembly and now here  in the U.S. Congress.  JOANNand I had reverse roles. When  JOANNran for the House of Delegates,  I was her mentor. I was glad to see her  success at being elected  there. And  when I ran for the U.S. Congress in  2004, JOANNwas my mentor.  We were both Realtors and shared  that common bond and that friendship.  ANN I was proud to support her in her historic elevation  to  the Congress. JO  ANN, as you have heard, was the first  Republican woman  to  serve  in  this  body. She was also the first woman  from Virginia to be re-elected.  We all know  that JO was a  woman of great faith, great strength,  great courage, great honesty and great  integrity. I don’t believe that it was  ever JOANN’s intention to be a trailblazer. I think her successes in her life  as a mother, a grandmother, a businesswoman, as a legislator are all the  result of a path that she chose in her  life, and that was the path that cared  for other people first, put other people  first, and that she stood very strong on  the principles to protect those around  her. That earned her the respect of the  people of the First District, and it lead  her on the path to the House of Delegates and then here.  JOANNwas a valued resource and a  trusted confidant. Here in Congress, I  was honored to work with her on issues  facing the people of Hampton Roads  and of Virginia. We served together on  the House Armed Services Committee,  and I have watched her very deep appreciation for the contributions of the  shipbuilding industry, and she understood the important role that the Navy  plays  in  our  Nation,  projecting  strength  and  security  around  the  world.  JOANNalso was a true leader and a  hero  in protecting our military and  their families, and she always worked  to ensure that their rights and interests were protected.  It is fitting that the month of October is dedicated to raising breast cancer awareness. For even as JOANNbattled her own illness, she saw her illness  as an opportunity to help other women.  When she was first diagnosed, she told  me that she would be healed, and she  was, from her first bout of cancer, and  that she would use this as an opportunity for other women to see and to  make sure that other women received  the health care and didn’t put things  off.  I know that today I  join my colleagues in extending our deepest sympathies to her family, to her husband  Chuck, to her staff, to her friends. I appreciate the opportunity to stand here  and to honor my good friend. I know  that we will all miss her greatly.  ",2007

As other women  in  the Congress  know,  there  is a  sisterhood among  many women Members.

When I came here a  little over 2  years ago, I walked into a room filled  with strangers, and I quickly looked  for the smiles. She was one of those  smiles. She quickly took me under her  wings.  In  addition  to  helping me  through the maze of Congress, she also  invited me to come to the best hour of  the week,  the  prayer  breakfast  on  Thursday. It’s an event I rarely, rarely  miss.  She not only was a fighter for her  district and a fighter for her country,  but she was a woman that truly loved  her family and loved the Lord, and it  showed in each and every day and in  each and every way of her life. To her  husband, Chuck, to her two sons, to her  darling granddaughter, my heart goes  out to you.  Every day since I learned of her cancer, I have been praying for her. I shall  continue those prayers for you. May  God bless all of you.  b1945  GENERALLEAVE  ",2007

2397,50,2007-10-09,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, I think for  those who are watching, you’ve seen  this Congress at its best, to see people  from both sides of the aisle come together, and that is a tribute to JOANN.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. I rise to pay  tribute to a great American and a member of  this House. JOANNDAVISwas a veteran legislator, businesswoman, and Member of Congress from Virginia’s First Congressional District. Her district, which stretches  from  the  Washington suburbs  to  the Hampton Roads  area,  is often called  ‘‘America’s 1st District;  the site of  the Jamestown settlement  is  located there.  Congresswoman DAVIS was  the  second  woman from Virginia, and the first Virginia Republican woman, elected to the House in her  own right. She was reelected by substantial  margins in 2002, 2004, and to her fourth term  in 2006. She was a productive member of  three very important committees in the House:  Armed Services, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs. She was the ranking Republican on the  House  Intelligence Subcommittee on  Intelligence Policy.  JOANNDAVISwas born in Rowan County  North Carolina, but lived in Virginia since she  was 9  years old. She attended Hampton  Roads Business College and worked in real  estate before she was elected to the Virginia  House of Delegates  in 1997. She was  reelected in 1999, where she served until her  election to Congress.  Congresswoman DAVIS died on Saturday,  October 6, 2007 and was a respected member  of this body and respected by all who knew  her. She was a legislator’s legislator. She was  known to often to put aside partisan politics  and reach across the aisle to legislate in a bipartisan manner for the best interests of the  American people.  Her presence will be greatly missed and we  all mourn her loss and extend our sincerest  condolences to her husband Chuck and her  children and grandchild.  Mr. Speaker, a dear colleague has fallen but  she will not be forgotten. We are all saddened  by our loss but we are happy to have served  with her. Our prayers and condolences go out  to her husband, Chuck, her children, and to  thousands of friends around the Nation. She  touched so many  lives during her  tenure  in  this body and she will be missed very much  by the people she represented so ably.  ",2007
2398,50,2007-10-09,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to express deepest condolences on the  passing of my fellow colleague from Virginia,  the Honorable JOANNDAVIS.  During her time in Congress, JOANNwas a  strong advocate  for her constituents and an  active voice on issues affecting the Commonwealth.  As Ranking Member of  the House Armed  Services Readiness Subcommittee, JO ANN  was well-positioned and a successful advocate  for her district’s economic bread and butter—  the shipbuilding and national defense industry.  Regarding our joint efforts to grant federal  recognition  to Virginia’s six state-recognized  tribes, JOANNwas a passionate and helpful  ally. Her familiarity with the tribes’ issues and  her testament as to their traditional values and  practices helped pave the way for the recognition bill’s passage in the House. I am grateful  that, despite her failing health, she lived to see  the bill receive the unanimous support of her  colleagues.  JOANNwill be deeply missed both within  Congress and  the Virginia delegation. Our  hearts and prayers go out  to her husband  Chuck Davis, her two sons, and their entire  extended family as they cope with the loss of  their beloved wife, mother and citizen  legislator.  ",2007

Res. 717, the ‘‘Privileged Resolution on  the Passing of  the Honorable JO  ANNDAVIS’’  Today we stand in remembrance of a distinguished member of the 110th Congress, Congresswoman JOANNDAVIS, who after a two  year battle with Breast Cancer has passed  away.  Her husband, Chuck Davis, battalion chief  for the Hampton Fire Department; two sons,  Christopher and Charles Davis, and extended  family survive her, remembering the incredible  legacy Congresswoman DAVIShas left behind  her.  A woman of modest beginnings, Congresswoman DAVISknew the meaning of hard work  and proved headstrong and committed as she  worked her way to becoming the first Republican woman to lead the First District of Virginia. She would maintain her leadership there  for 7 years.  She has been praised for her commitment  to Armed Services, and commended for her  commitment to researching and pursuing legislative reform.  DAVIS Her determination  to pursue change and  prevail over hardships knew no bounds, even  in her fight against breast cancer.  Even in this moment of memorial, her presence and upstanding character is reflected as  we discuss a recommitment of H.R. 1124—a  bill providing  financial assistance  to  low-income students and ensuring a brighter future  for all Virginian youth.  Because of the Congresswoman’s ongoing  commitment to preserving life on a social and  political level, my colleagues and I will make  great strides  to continue supporting breast  cancer awareness and  the wellbeing of all  Americans.  In her memory we will continue to uphold  two priorities to which she was greatly dedicated.  While it is with sadness that we say goodbye to an incredible woman, we think of her  with joy and fondness as we remember her  devotion to creating a better America.  The use of her  life  to benefit  ‘‘America’s  First District of Virginia’’ is unquestionable and  has served to ensure a sense of responsibility  among her fellow colleagues in the 109th and  100th Congress.  I  thank Congresswoman DAVIS for dedicating her life to service on the behalf of the  1st District of Virginia. I am honored to have  worked with her and I truly appreciate all she  has given.  Her efforts have touched many lives and her  exceptional impact upon our country will create a lasting legacy for generations to come.  Congresswoman  will  be  greatly  missed.  ",2007

She was devoted to her husband, Chuck, her two boys, Charlie and Chris,  and her granddaughter, Charlotte, as well as  all of the people she served. She and I were  close  friends—we  talked about everything—  and I, along with others here in Congress, will  miss her dearly. JOANNnever gave up—she  fought hard until the end.  She had her priorities right—God is going to  be very good to JOANNDAVIS.  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to honor  the  life of JOANN  DAVIS—a friend and colleague who served the  people of Virginia for 7 years in the House of  Representatives.  As the first female Republican elected to the  House from Virginia, JOANNwas dedicated to  representing her constituents with a genuine  leadership and passion for public service. She  was committed to fighting government waste  and strengthening our national defense and  remained devoted to her duty despite her illness. As fellow members of the House Armed  Services Committee and  the Committee on  Foreign Affairs, I am grateful to have known  and worked with JO ANN.  I am especially  grateful  for  the 3 years we sat  together on  Thursdays at the Congressional Prayer Breakfast which she ultimately so devotedly chaired.

2403,57,2007-10-09,Mr. SESSIONS.," So the opportunity  to go in and clear, the opportunity to  allow this burned timber to be harvested would mean that bugs and all  the things which might find a way to  eat this timber or weaken it, rather  than clearing  it and getting started  again, is in the process of decay, not  health at this time.  ",2007
2404,57,2007-10-09,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," I will tell  you what is worse. We have a lot of  cattle ranchers out there who have permits to graze on some of this ground.  Because of the intensity of this fire, it  may be one year or two before the  grasses come back and they will be allowed to graze. They are having now  today, literally today, with the price of  hay being what it is and the demand,  they  are having  to  liquidate  their  herds. Some of  them may go completely out of business all because  these lands aren’t being properly managed.  Now,  for our  friends who are concerned  about  global  warming  and  greenhouse gas emissions, I serve on  the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Climate Change. A fire  that burns as intensely or more so than  this one probably emits 100 tons of  greenhouse gas emission for every acre,  100 tons per acre. This burned 140,000  acres. A good, green, healthy-growing  forest like a lot of them we have in the  Northwest will sequester between 4 and  6 tons of carbon per acre. So wouldn’t  you think that this Congress would be  focusing on doing better management  on  our  forests? And  yet  the  subcommittee that I used to chair has now  been compressed in with the National  Parks, Forests and Public Lands Subcommittee into one, has held one hearing in 91⁄2months on this issue. They  have marked up no legislation dealing  with this issue. Nothing is happening  of consequence, except taxpayers are  spending  $1.2 billion  to  fight  these  blazes. The future these kids are looking at is a long way off. I like my forests green and healthy, not black. But  some of the groups out there who appeal  even  thinning  in  these  areas  issued a statement recently that said  burned forests are healthy forests.  Now, I suppose in the enormous scope  of time, they grow back. We know that.  But I don’t think burned forests are the  policy that Americans want us to have  when  it  comes  to  their  forests.  It  doesn’t work well for habitat, for water  quality and watersheds.  Meanwhile, I’ll bet we don’t cut a  stick of this, or very little of it. Instead, because this will get litigated  because we won’t change the law here  which is what needs to happen, even  though you and I would do it and you  have been helpful in these efforts, instead we will proudly go to the local  store and get our furniture made in  China  from  illegally harvested wood  from countries that have no environmental laws where the forests are extraordinarily  important  around  the  equator to sequester carbon.  b2045  I don’t understand the  ineffective,  wasteful vision of the other side, when  I believe no land manager in America  would allow this to occur and wouldn’t  go in right afterward. Counties don’t  do it. Private foresters don’t allow this  to occur. They get in right away. I  have been out on sites, and they get in  right away, clean it up. Our State of  Oregon has a very progressive Forest  Practices Act. But they don’t wait.  They don’t wait a year. It will be a  year before they are done writing their  plan, and then it will be subject to appeal and litigation, most likely for another year.  ",2007
2405,57,2007-10-09,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. Speaker, I remember when the fires at Yellowstone  were taking place, and I remember seeing how many of our friends who were  environmentalists said, let it burn, let  it burn, and yet I remember seeing the  carnage that took place with wildlife  and the millions of animals who not  only lost their home but then would be  thrust out in the cold as a result of the  huge fire, when in fact I had learned  from my being an Eagle Scout, and the  gentleman  from Oregon  is an Eagle  Scout, we learned in our forestry merit  badges that healthy forests are those  where you can come in and clear out  those things that were from years of  use, and come and clean the forest, and  you could come and take sections so  that you made sure that any fire did  not destroy  the whole  thing. They  would come and cut the  forest and  work with Mother Nature and then replant.  Mr. Speaker, in the last 5 or 6 years,  and you can look at any National Geographic or perhaps the Discovery Channel and see where the people, the companies  that  grow  trees,  they have  healthy forests. I think the healthiest  forests are where private people and  private companies own the trees, as opposed to the government, because the  government has a policy of ineffective,  wasteful and intrusive government in  managing our forests.  ",2007
2406,57,2007-10-09,Mr. WALDEN of Oregon.," The other  thing we learned as Scouts, and, like  you say, we are both Eagle Scouts,  what has always stuck with me when it  comes to how we manage our resources  was a very simple line:  ‘‘Leave your  campsite better than you  found  it.’’  That, I think, is a great guiding principle for those of us in this body, not  only for natural resource policy, but  for this country, to leave it better than  you found it.  Mr. Speaker, let me just suggest that  we burned more than 8 million acres  this year, and 5.7 million acres, which  is our new average that we are burning  every year in this country, is an area  larger than the entire State of New  Jersey. We throw these big numbers  around in Washington, the bureaucrats  do it all the time, and we do it from  time to time. Think about every year  you’re burning an area of your national  forest and grasslands and other areas  larger than the size of the State of New  Jersey.  Let me tell you what just happened  in my district of eastern Oregon. I have  70,000 square miles of terrific eastern  Oregon. Three of the last mills have  been put either on indefinite closure or  closure  in very remote areas where  they are  surrounded by overstocked  forests that need all this work, and  they are some of the last, if not the  last mills in these communities, and  198 people in those three communities  have lost their jobs. That is 2.6 percent  of nonfarm payroll.  Now the State’s economists, the certified smart economic  folks, said,  I  wonder what that impact of those 198  jobs would be if it was spread over 2.6  percent of nonfarm payroll over the  Portland metropolitan  area.  So  a  standard city in America, what do you  think that would be? It would be the  loss of 26,400 jobs.  So all across the rural West in small  communities where  the mills  close,  there’s barely a yawn or a whimper in  this Congress about what is happening,  and yet the prior forest service chiefs  and the current one will tell you our  country and our forests and our ability  to manage those forests cannot be sustained if we lose the infrastructure to  do the management.  That is precisely what is happening  today, for a lot of reasons, some of it  market conditions, but part of  the  market conditions is an 80 percent reduction in the timber harvest on Federal land, an inability to go in and even  clean up after a fire in less than 2 years  on Federal land.  I was just out on the GW fire, not  named for me, even though it’s my initials, GW fire outside of Black Butte  Ranch, Sisters, Oregon. It burned, I  think, 7,000 acres, something like that,  or 8,000. Where the forest service had  done thinning, the fire dropped to the  ground and they put it out. That is  part of what we were trying to accomplish with our Healthy Forest Restoration Act that President Bush signed  into law, that we as Republicans wrote,  with bipartisan help.  The  thinning  project,  where  it  dropped to the ground, the trees are all  green around it, was held up by environmentalists for let’s say 5 years in  VerDate Aug 31 2005  03:21 Oct 10, 2007 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 0636 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K09OC7.108 H09OCPT1 N C _ E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o l e o n c         ",2007
2407,78,2007-10-09,Mr. RANGEL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to introduce the article, ‘‘Caribbean Call Centers Booming,’’ published in New York CARIB  News on September 19, 2007. The piece  notes that American corporations are increasingly setting up centers  in  the Caribbean,  breathing new life into the region’s workforce  and diversifying its economy.  A drop in communication costs has ushered  in newfound competition, willing the area’s island nations to extend tax incentives in search  of  business—and  it’s working.  For  those  economies with the smallest populations, it’s  made a world of positive difference, injecting  droves of new workers and reducing rampant  unemployment.  CARIBBEANCALLCENTERSBOOMING  CASTRIES.—In a global search for low-cost  customer service, AOL considered call centers in India and other hotspots—then settled on the tiny island of St. Lucia.  In choosing the Caribbean island, AOL, a  unit of Time Warner Inc., joined other U.S.  companies that have made the region a new  global hub for call centers.  Plunging communication costs, workers  who relate easily to American customers and  the region’s famed hospitality are attracting  American corporations, boosting the work  force in the ‘‘nearshore’’ service industry in  the Caribbean.  Jamaica is one of the leaders with about  14,000 employees in the sector. In the Dominican Republic, 18,000 agents, many of them  bilingual, are handling calls in English and  Spanish. Call centers dedicated to customer  service have also opened in Barbados, Trinidad, and Dominica.  According to Robert Goodwin, the AOL  manager who chose a call centre  in St.  Lucia, the islands all seem to be really positive as opposed to the surly attitudes you  have in some of the other places. AOL still  uses call centers in India and elsewhere for  technical support and other services—taking  advantage of that country’s large numbers of  workers with technical and advanced degrees.  But the Caribbean  is becoming  increasingly competitive in the call centre industry, with  island governments offering tax  and other incentives to lure companies to  their shores.  Jamaica, for example, granted call centers  ‘‘free zone’’ status that allows owners to repatriate 100 percent of their earnings tax-  free. The Caribbean has taken only a tiny  share of the market from still-hot India and  the Philippines, but the impact is huge on islands with  tiny populations.  In Montego  Bay, a resort area on Jamaica’s north coast  that accounts for about half the island’s call  centre  jobs, developers have rapidly built  thousands of concrete, single-family homes  to accommodate the workers.  The industry owes much of its success to a  telecommunications  liberalization  that  began sweeping former British colonies in  the Caribbean about six years ago. As new  suppliers have challenged the monopoly of  Britain-based Cable & Wireless PLC, lower  prices allowed the region to compete.  The collections and call-centre firm KM2,  which holds the AOL contract in St. Lucia,  has opened a site in Barbados and, according  to owner David Kreiss, the firm is looking to  expand again as new telecoms install fiber  optic cable.  The number of people working at Caribbean call centers has increased from 11,300 in  2002 to a current total of 55,000, with an annual  economic  impact  of US$2.5  billion.  Large  American  companies  including  Verizon, AT&T, Delta Air Lines, AIG and  Nortel have used Caribbean call centers,  while often keeping operations in Asia or  elsewhere. While much of the profits go to  U.S.-owned operators, the islands welcome  the business to diversify their economies and  counter high unemployment.  f  RECOGNIZING EMERGENCY  NURSES WEEK  HON. LOIS CAPPS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2007  ",2007
2408,78,2007-10-09,Mrs. CAPPS.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to recognize October 7 through October 13 as  Emergency Nurses Week.  As a nurse for over 40 years and the cochair of the House Nursing Caucus, I have a  longstanding commitment to the work nurses  do and to highlight the impact they have on  other important issues, such as homeland security preparedness efforts.  There  are  approximately  100,000  emergency nurses in the United States. Emergency  nurses make a difference each day in peoples’  lives, both within and beyond  the  traditional  boundaries of the hospital emergency department. Working in areas such as critical care,  research, technology, flight and ground transport and injury prevention, emergency nurses  combine  state-of-the-art  skills with heartfelt  compassion for those they serve.  Since 1989,  the Emergency Nurses Association has celebrated the second Wednesday  in October as Emergency Nurses Day, a day  set aside to honor emergency nurses for their  commitment to patient care. Starting in 2001,  because 1 day is simply not enough to recognize all  contributions made by emergency  nurses,  the Emergency Nurses Association  expanded the celebration to devote an entire  week to honoring emergency nursing.  This week  is particularly  important as evidenced by a survey conducted by the Emergency Nurses Association  last year showing  that 86 percent of emergency nurses had  been victims of assault on  the  job at  least  once in the past 3 years. Nonetheless, a vast  majority say  they will continue  to be emergency nurses in the years to come. This is a  noble profession practiced by noble women  and men and  they deserve our  recognition  and thanks.  Emergency Nurses Day is Wednesday, October 10, and this year’s theme, ‘‘Stepping into  their lives when they need you the most’’ reflects the dedication of emergency nurses in  the United States and around the world.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Emergency Nurses Association for  its work  to define  the  future of emergency  nursing and emergency  care. Founded  in  1970,  the Emergency Nurses Association  serves as the voice of nearly 33,000 members  and their patients.  Finally, Madam Speaker, I encourage all of  our colleagues to help spread the word about  the critical importance of nursing to our Nation’s health care system. Also, I ask that my  fellow colleagues  join me and my cochair,  Congressman STEVELATOURETTE, in the work  of the House Nursing Caucus.  I thank my colleagues for their attention to  this  important public health  issue and again  am pleased to recognize October 10 as Emergency Nurses Day and this week, October 7  through October 13, as Emergency Nurses  Week.  f  SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE  DIVERSITY ASSURANCE ACT  HON. DANNY K. DAVIS  OFILLINOIS  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2007  ",2007
2409,78,2007-10-09,Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.," Madam Speaker, I am  pleased  that Senator DANIELAKAKAwill be  joining me today in introducing the Senior Executive Service Diversity Assurance Act. The  act addresses the extremely important issue of  diversity in the Senior Executive Service, SES.  Senator AKAKAand I plan to continue our collaboration in the future, introducing additional  legislation  that will make a difference  in  the  lives of Federal employees.  Our  introduction of  the Senior Executive  Service Diversity Assurance Act would not  have been possible without the hard work of  the African American Federal Executives Association, the National Association of Hispanic  Federal Executives, the Asian American Government Executives Network, Federally Employed Women, Blacks  in Government, and  the Senior Executive Association.  I applaud  them for not only raising the lack of diversity  in the SES as an issue but for devoting their  time and energy to work with our subcommittees to rectify it.  The lack of diversity in the SES has been a  longstanding concern of mine. As a first step  toward doing something about it, I asked the  Government Accountability Office, GAO, to investigate  the  situation. GAO  subsequently  issued two reports—in 2001 and 2003. Both  reports documented a poorly diversified SES.  The 2003 report was entitled ‘‘Senior Executive Service: Enhanced Agency Efforts Needed To Improve Diversity as the Senior Corps  Turns Over’’ (GAO–03–34). As the title suggests, this report revealed that while there will  be a large amount of turnover in the SES in  the years ahead due to retirements and attrition, it will not result in greater racial diversity.  While  there are numerous minorities  in  the  pipeline  ready  to be promoted,  to  few are  being given the opportunity to advance. Well,  you might ask, why not, and what can be  done about it?

2413,9,2007-10-22,Mr. GRIJALVA.," Mr. Speaker, H.R.  783 authorizes a boundary expansion at  Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado of approximately 362  acres. Mesa Verde National Park, established in 1906, contains the most extensive concentration of cliff-dwellings  in the United States.  H.R. 783 authorizes the acquisition of  two parcels of the land that border the  park. One parcel is in full view of the  park’s entrance road and contains important archaeological  sites, an ancient  forest, and the  largest known  population  of  a  globally  imperiled  plant. This parcel is currently zoned  for a subdivision, but the owners would  prefer to protect the property through  inclusion in the park.  The second parcel is currently owned  by a park partner, the Mesa Verde  Foundation.  JOHN SALAZAR,  b1445  The foundation intends to donate the  parcel to the park for the development  of a visitor information center and museum collection facility but cannot do  so until the park boundary is expanded.  Mr. Speaker, the administration has  testified in support of this legislation,  the Natural Resources Committee approved the  legislation with a minor  amendment by unanimous consent.  I want to acknowledge, at this point,  the hard work of the bill’s sponsor,  Representative  in  bringing this important legislation forward. We support this bill and urge its  adoption by the House today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
2414,9,2007-10-22,Mr. GOHMERT.," Mr. Speaker, once  again, I think my friend from Arizona  has adequately explained the bill. We  support it and I have no objections, and  even though it’s unusual here in Congress to yield back any time, we do so  yield back our time.  ",2007
2415,9,2007-10-22,Mr. GRIJALVA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  such time as he may consume to the  sponsor of this legislation, Representative JOHNSALAZAR.  ",2007
2416,9,2007-10-22,Mr. SALAZAR.," Mr. Speaker, I first  want to thank Chairman GRIJALVA for  assistance  in moving this  important  piece of legislation forward.  I introduced H.R. 783, along with my  friend and colleague MARKUDALL from  Colorado, to expand the boundary of  Mesa Verde National Park. Mesa Verde  National Park protects the most notable and best-preserved cliff dwellings in  this country. The park is also vital to  the economy of southwest Colorado.  Established by Congress in June 1906,  Mesa Verde National Park was the first  cultural park to be set aside in the National Park System.  Over 1,400 years ago, the Puebloans  settled at Mesa Verde where they built  elaborate  stone communities  in  the  protected alcoves of the canyon, calling it home for over 700 years.  When  President  Teddy  Roosevelt  signed  the  law  establishing Mesa  Verde, he claimed that it was to ‘‘preserve the works of man.’’  The establishment of Mesa Verde set  off intense public interest in preserving  other such sites in the American southwest and nationwide. Today, the towns  of Cortez and Mancos, in Montezuma  County, Colorado, rely heavily on tourism from Mesa Verde National Park.  H.R. 783 authorizes the National Park  Service to acquire two critically important plots at the gateway to Mesa  Verde National Park. One is a 324-acre  tract of private  land to be acquired  from the Henneman family. I want to  credit the Henneman family, as they  remained  steadfast  in  their  termination to see the property included in  this park, and I’d like to thank them  for their dedication.  The second plot of land is a 38-acre  tract to be donated to the National  Park Service by the Mesa Verde Foundation. With passage of H.R. 783, the  National Park Service will have the  authority to accept the generous donation of this parcel from the foundation.  In keeping with the longstanding tradition of preserving the resources and  cultural heritage at Mesa Verde National Park, H.R. 783 will greatly enhance the visitor experience at Mesa  Verde for future generations of Americans.  I urge the House to adopt this important piece of legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to someday come out and  visit Mesa Verde National Park.  ",2007

The question was taken; and (two-  thirds being  in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as  amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on  the table.  f  DWIGHT D.

2423,16,2007-10-22,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 767, as amended, would give the  Secretary of  the  Interior additional  tools to combat harmful nonnative species that are hurting native wildlife  and plants on our national wildlife refuges. I commend the author of this bill,  Representative RONKIND, for his leadership and on other matters affecting  the National Wildlife Refuge System.  H.R. 767, as amended, authorizes the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  to  issue  grants to States to assess the extent of  invasive species affecting refuges. The  Secretary may also provide matching  grants to entities for the control, mitigation, and eradication of invasive species on refuges and adjoining non-Federal lands.  The bill, as amended, includes a provision authorizing  the Secretary  to  give States financial assistance to address  invasive  species  outbreaks  in  emergency situations.  H.R. 767, as amended, will encourage  the development of partnerships to address the threat of invasive species on  a cooperative landscape basis. I urge  adoption of the bill, as amended.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
2424,16,2007-10-22,Mr. GOHMERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  support of H.R. 767, the REPAIR Act,  as it is called, and yield myself such  time as I may consume.  I would like to also congratulate and  thank my dear friend from Guam. She  gives hope to this country and encouragement by showing that there is class  and there is graciousness in this body,  and  it  exists  in  the delegate  from  Guam. She also carries that out as  chairman of the subcommittee.  Now, the effectiveness of the REPAIR Act will be in direct proportion  to the amount of money Congress allocates. We simply cannot afford to let  our wildlife refuges be systematically  destroyed by invasive species, and that  is happening. This legislation is a positive step because it offers hope in the  fight against invasives in the future.  One such species is the giant silvinia,  a plant that has made its way across  many lakes as it has entered Texas. It  is  a  small  harmless-looking  little  aquatic plant that finds itself on boat  trailers leaving a lake. When the boat  trailer is lowered into another lake,  the  nightmare  floating  plant  finds  itself in a new lake, and it can take  over. It doubles its size in less than a  week, and  in no time covers acres,  shutting off sunlight, killing off plants  underneath, which results in aquatic  life dying. It must be fought and eradicated without doing damage  to  the  lake during the fight. Such a battle  takes many good minds and hard workers coming together to prevent this  creeping menace from being the last  thing left in a lake alive.  In Louisiana, there are cities  like  Shreveport whose sources of drinking  water are being put in jeopardy by this  freak of nature. Just recently I toured  Caddo Lake,  the  largest  freshwater  natural lake at one time and a true  treasure for America with its cypress  trees, Spanish moss, and unusual fish.  We had a joint task force of biologists  and brilliant environmental problem-  solvers  from Federal, State, private  groups, who all had the same goal:  eradicate the invasion of this foreign  species without doing damage to the  lake.  I just want to read a list of the types  of people that are willing to come together when we deal with something  that is such a grave threat to our water  supplies.  We had Dan Turner,  representing  Congressman JIMMCCRERY of Louisiana; Ken Shaw, chairman, Cypress  Valley  Navigation  District;  Robert  Speight,  President,  Greater  Caddo  Lake Association; Jack Canson, community  response  coordinator; Mark  Williams, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Caddo  Lake National Wildlife Refuge manager; Al Tasker, USDA/Animal Plant  Health  Inspection  Service;  Dustin  Grant, USDA/Plant  Protection  and  Quarantine, State operations support  officer; Dr. Earl Chilton, Texas Parks  & Wildlife,  and  a member  of  the  Invasive Species Advisory Committee  for the National Invasive Species Council, Department of the Interior; Paul  Hoffman, Deputy Assistant Secretary,  Department of Interior/NISC; also Dr.  Michael Grodowitz, U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers,  biocontrol  expert;  Dr.  Randy Westbrooks, U.S. Geological  Survey,  invasive  plant  coordinator;  Judge  Richard  Anderson,  Harrison  County judge; Jerry Lomax, Harrison  County Precinct 1 commissioner; C.E.  Bourne, Marion County Precinct  3  commissioner for Judge Parker; Sam  Canup, mayor of the City of Uncertain,  and  that  is a  real city, Uncertain,  Texas; Jay Webb, Caddo Lake Chamber  of Commerce; Bill Abney, Red River  Compact; Walt Sears, manager, Northeast Texas Municipal Water District;  Dwight Shellman, Caddo Lake Institute; Todd Dickenson, manager, Caddo  Lake State Park; Alan Grantham, Dallas Caddo Club; Connie Ware, Marshall  Chamber of Commerce; Dr. Jim Harris,  Marshall Chamber of Commerce, Water  Committee Chair; and Sam Moseley of  Marshall.  It just points up how important what  this  bill  addresses  is.  These  are  FALEOMAVAEGA)  invasive species that come into lakes  and to parks and take over and destroy  the native habitat that we are trying  to preserve. I have to say, when we had  this meeting that went on for a number  of hours, I don’t recall one time during  the entire meeting where anybody ever  asked what party anybody ever supported politically. It was all about trying to protect what God had graced  this country with, and it is wonderful  to see that kind of support.  But what is very clear is that we cannot fight off these nonnative invasive  species unless we work together in a bipartisan, in a cumulative fashion with  all  these different  scientists, biologists, governmental groups coming together, because it affects so many different areas. It’s one of the reasons I  am so grateful to my friend from Guam  and for all of those that have worked  to help make this possible. We have got  to preserve what we have got, and this  is one of the ways to do it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007

This is not  a Republican or Democratic issue. This  is something that really is important  that serves the best interests of our  Nation.  I know my good  friend,  the gentleman  from Wisconsin, would have  been here on the floor, but I am sure he  probably  had  some  transportation  problems coming here today. I want to  commend him especially for his leadership and  for the tremendous service  that he has rendered in promoting the  interests of wildlife and refuge conservation measures, also as a distinguished member of the subcommittee;  but I also want to note that I know he  would have spoken, and not only in  support of a bill that he has sponsored,  but certainly for his knowledge and his  commitment in dealing with the issues  and conservation and wildlife refuges.

2431,23,2007-10-22,Ms. BORDALLO.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  The purpose of H.R. 1462, as introduced by our colleague Congressman  MARKUDALLof Colorado and amended  by  the Committee  on Natural Resources, is to authorize the Secretary  of the Interior to participate in the implementation of the Platte River Recovery  Implementation Program  for  Endangered Species in the Central and  Lower Platte River Basin and to modify the Pathfinder Dam and Reservoir.  H.R. 1462, as amended, would secure  benefits  for  four  target  species and  their associated habitats while also  providing Endangered Species Act compliance  for existing and certain new  water-related activities in the Platte  River basin.  H.R. 1462, as amended, also authorizes  the modification  of Pathfinder  Dam and Reservoir as is required by a  legal settlement and is the key part of  the water devoted to recovery implementation.  Mr. Speaker, this program is the result of years and years of negotiation  and compromise between water users  and environmentalists and should be  seen as a model for dealing with endangered species conflicts. I congratulate  my Democratic colleague from Colorado,  the Honorable Representative  MARKUDALL, for his hard work on this  legislation. And I strongly urge my colleagues to stand in support of this noncontroversial bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",2007
2432,23,2007-10-22,Mr. GOHMERT.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 1462 stems from endangered species conflicts along the Platte River.  As a result of lawsuits and the real  threat of water and power infrastructure being shut down over endangered  species conflicts, the Federal Government, three States, water and power  users, and environmental organizations  came together on the Platte River Recovery Program, and this legislation  implements part of that program. The  result is that existing water and power  infrastructure is protected while a collaborative and far-reaching program to  help save four different species begins.  Since  this  program  is  contingent  upon Federal  appropriations  and  a  State can opt out, the governance committee charged with implementing the  program has the enormous responsibility of keeping all stakeholders together, conversing with affected parties, communities and landowners on  land and water issues and finding real  results. Congress will continue to have  oversight on this program to see if it is  being run effectively and efficiently.  This legislation, if implemented properly, can be a win-win for both the people and species of the Platte River  basin.

2439,37,2007-10-22,Mr. GORDON of Tennessee.," Madam  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Madam Speaker, I am pleased that  the House will consider today H.R. 3776,  the Energy Storage Technology Advancement Act. I would like to thank  my  colleagues  on  the Science  and  Technology Committee for their unanimous support in making this a good,  bipartisan piece of legislation.  In particular, I would like to thank  my good friend and ranking member,  Mr. HALL, for his interest in this field  of research.  In crafting H.R. 3776,  I  adopted several provisions from a bill  Mr. HALL introduced earlier this year,  and he and his staff have worked hard  to make this a good bill.  H.R. 3776 authorizes research, development and demonstration activities  for energy storage technologies that  offer a wide range of economic, environmental and security benefits.  Stationary energy storage systems  will bring efficiencies to the electric  delivery system, will improve grid reliability and security, and can even help  to postpone the need  for additional,  costly electric generation facilities.  Energy storage technologies can also  help  to  integrate  renewable  energy  sources into the grid by making electricity  from  these  intermittent  resources more stable and reliable.  Furthermore, advanced battery systems can revolutionize our transportation  sector by allowing  for more  electric-drive vehicles, thus reducing  our reliance on conventional transportation fuels.  But unfortunately, we may be fast  losing our ability to develop and manufacture  these  technologies at home.  Through the collaborative public-private research, development and demonstration programs authorized in H.R.  3776, we can ensure that the United  States establishes a robust domestic  manufacturing  base  for  these  technologies.  To truly transform the way we manage our energy use, we must do more  than make incremental improvements  to current technologies. Our economic  and environmental security lies in our  ability to deploy the next generation  energy technologies. Advances in energy storage are vital to diversifying  our energy supplies and transforming  our transportation sector.  Once again, I thank my colleagues on  the  Science  and Technology  Committee for working with me on this legislation, and I urge all Members to support the bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2007
2440,37,2007-10-22,Mr. REICHERT.," Madam Speaker, I  rise in support of H.R. 3776, the Energy  Storage Technology Advancement Act,  and I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  Electricity  is the  lifeblood of our  country. Without reliable electricity,  our country would not be the world  leader that it is today. Therefore, anything that can be done to improve and  secure the reliability of the electric  grid should be supported and encouraged. H.R. 3776 aims to do just that by  focusing research and development on  ways to store energy which would not  only assist in reliability, but also efficiency of fuel use and security of not  only our grid but also, in a broader  sense, of our country.  Energy storage would allow for the  enhanced use of renewable energy such  as wind and solar.  Currently, the ability of wind energy  and solar energy to contribute electricity to the electric grid is tied to  when the wind is blowing or when the  sun is shining, therefore, making these  sources not as reliable as conventional  sources of energy such as coal, natural  gas and nuclear. With energy storage,  excess generation that is unable to be  used at the time of generation can be  stored for use at a later time. This allows for wind and solar energy to be  potential sources of base load generation.  In addition to energy storage for stationary sources, there is also a promising field of energy storage for vehicles, the most recognizable example  being batteries that would be used in  plug-in hybrids. Plug-in hybrids would  allow for a further decrease in transportation fuel consumption from conventional hybrids, thereby increasing  our national security by decreasing our  reliance on foreign sources of oil.  H.R. 3776 addresses the battery obstacle by including a research and development program  into batteries and  battery systems and a demonstration  program to prove the viability of the  R&D.  Madam Speaker, I’d like to thank the  chairman of  the Science and Technology Committee and sponsor of this  bill for recognizing the importance of  energy storage to our country’s energy  future and also for including portions  of Ranking Member HALL’s  energy  storage language that was included in  H.R. 2483 and cosponsored by several  members of  the Science and Technology Committee.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2007
2441,37,2007-10-22,Mr. GORDON of Tennessee.," Madam  Speaker, let me say there’s no question  that Mr. HALLplayed a major role in  this, and I’m glad that we could have  this type of, again, bipartisan unanimous bill.  If my friend from Washington State  has no other speakers, I have none.  ",2007

2445,44,2007-10-22,Mr. REICHERT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today in support of H.R. 3775, the Industrial Energy Efficiency Research  and Development Act of 2007, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.  The industrial sector of our economy  is currently the largest user of energy.  According to the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration, the industrial sector consumed 32  percent of the Nation’s energy in 2006.  While the industrial sector has made  impressive efficiency gains since 1980,  more is needed and more can be done.  The Department of Energy currently  runs the  Industrial Technology Programs, ITP, whose mission it is to improve  the  energy  intensity  of  the  United States industrial sector, whose  industries  include aluminum, chemicals, forest products, glass, metal casting, mining, petroleum  refining and  steel. The  ITP program engages  in  partnerships with industry to conduct  research and development into energy  efficiency technologies, as well as demonstrating  those  technologies  and  transferring them to the marketplace.  The program has been very successful  in  its efforts with over 140 projects  reaching the commercial market.  The ITP also conducts energy assessments, to help industrial manufacturers of all sizes, through both its Save  Energy Now and university-based Industrial Assessment Centers, IACs. The  Save Energy Now program completed  265 assessments that identified energy  savings of more than $585 million per  year.  The IACs serve a dual role, aiding  small and medium-sized business to reduce their energy costs and the training of university  students who will  take  the  efficiency knowledge  they  have learned and apply it in the workforce.  The bill before us today will ensure  that ITP’s beneficial work will continue to help the industrial sector reduce  its cost, which not only helps  them  remain  globally  competitive  while allowing them to keep their operations in the United States of America. Further, the ITP aids our country’s goal of reducing our dependence  on foreign sources of energy by improving this critical sector’s use of energy.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",2007

2447,44,2007-10-22,Mr. REICHERT.," Certainly this is  important.  It’s  something  that  can  make a significant difference to what  we’re doing for the world and for industry in the United States of America, to  make sure that we are kept competitive.  There’s so many things, whether it is  using waste to pelletize wood into new  kinds of fuel, whether it is solar, water,  any of the many things, wind, that  we’re doing and to encourage to make  these things possible is something that  is very important to me.

I appreciate your support of this important legislation.  I  recognize your Committee’s  jurisdictional interest in this area, and I agree that  the inaction of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce with respect to the bill does  not  in any way serve as a  jurisdictional  precedent as to our two committees.

2450,44,2007-10-22,Mr. POE.," Mr. Speaker,  the  first  amendment protects the fundamental  natural rights of free speech and free  press.  These pillars of principle are listed  first because they are the most important. These two freedoms ensure the  protection of all the other rights that  follow in the Bill of Rights.  Many years have passed since these  values were chiseled into the Constitution, but they are still under attack by  the elites who advocate Federal control  of both. Why? Because these censors  disagree with the content or claim it’s  inaccurate or it’s not fair. Even former  Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day  O’Connor said  last year that people  should not harshly criticize the Supreme Court or its rulings.  The Constitution does not guarantee  speech or press to be fair or even accurate. It guarantees it to be free. ‘‘Fair’’  is too subjective a term.  Our Framers were  primarily  concerned about protecting the political  and religious discourse. Why? Because  they are the most controversial and  the most important.  Any action by the Federal Government to control speech or press should  be met with loud, harsh words; fiery  oratory; and a blazing pen.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  SPECIAL ORDERS  ",2007

2452,51,2007-10-22,Mrs. JONES of Ohio.," I thank Ms.  for  her  leadership  on  these issues and for joining me during  the Congressional Black Caucus hour.  Let me talk about Judge Southwick  for  just a  few minutes, and then  I  would  like  to  review  some  of  the  progress that has been made under the  leadership  of  our  Chair, Ms. KILPATRICK, in the 110th Congress.  As we were  talking  about Judge  Southwick, you have  to understand  this will be the first controversial judicial nomination considered by the Senate since Democrats took the majority.  It has been 10 months since the Senate  changed hands, and the people expect a  difference in the way judicial nominaJACKSON-LEE tions are handled. We don’t want to go  back to the way they were handled  under the Republican leadership.  The Congressional Black Caucus and  the civil rights groups warned the Senate about Roberts and Alito, yet they  were both confirmed. The first full Supreme Court term of the Roberts court  showed that we are able to predict how  judges will act or  respond on civil  rights cases once confirmed.  To confirm a lower court judge in the  face of a bad record on civil rights will  simply be too much to bear. Let me  step aside for a moment, and I heard  my colleague Ms. SHEILAJACKSON-LEE  talk about there being a white judge  and an all-white jury and a white prosecutor. I served as a judge for 10 years  in the Common Pleas Court, a general  jurisdiction court, in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. I served for 3 years as an assistant county prosecutor and 8 years  as an elected prosecutor. I have been in  courtrooms where there have been all-  white juries, and I will not say that an  all-white jury cannot be fair. But what  the law says is you should have a jury  of your peers. And the law also says  that people  should not be excluded  from a jury just because of their race.  I have seen an attempt for that to happen in other cases.  It is so very, very important that if  we expect people to follow the law and  be a part of the law and be a part of the  judicial system, that they have a belief  that the judicial system will be fair.  Once you have that perception and belief, then you can succumb to the rule  of law. In this country, so often we see  instances where young men and women  have come before the court and they  have not had fairness, and that is when  it is important to have a circuit court  where you can appeal your decision in  a trial level court to the circuit court  for relief.  The fight in the Fifth Circuit is a  fight worth having. It has the highest  percentage of minority residents, black  and brown, of any circuit. At the same  time, the civil rights jurisprudence is  far  to  the  right. We have already  talked about the Jena Six.  There  is a history with this seat.  President Bush  is  intent on placing  someone who has a history adverse to  civil rights in Mississippi sit on this  court. Charles Pickering and Michael  Wallace were nominated, but couldn’t  get confirmed because of their civil  rights records. This is the third try by  the administration, and the pattern is  very clear. We believe that the President, if he was really paying attention  to  the people of America, what he  would in fact do is withdraw this nomination and go on and allow us to have  someone who would be fair and honest.  We may not win this battle on a  sound bite or our debate on the floor of  the House of Representatives, but we  believe  that  the Senate, we believe  that this Senate under the majority,  Democratic majority, is going to step  up to the plate and make the right decision. We expect that they will take a  look at his background and experience  and make that decision.  So I am pleased, as I said, having  been a judge, and it is a difficult job  being a judge. You have to have the  right temperament. You have to give  people the opportunity to present their  evidence, and you make decisions and  rulings on evidence and admissibility  and whether it is probative, whether it  can be prejudicial. And if it is prejudicial,  is  it outweighed by the probative value. And be familiar with the  rules of evidence such that when you  sit in the chair as the judge making a  decision, and the reason, and it is symbolic, under the law, the reason judges  wear robes, the robe  is supposed to  cover the human frailty of a judge and  allow the judge to step up and be fair  and set aside any of their background  or experience that would be adverse.  So we are concerned about this judge,  Judge Leslie Southwick, and we implore the U.S. Senate to not confirm  his nomination.  I am going to close on a few of the  accomplishments  that  the  Congressional Black Caucus has been involved  with over the first 9 months. We are  pleased to have an opportunity to be in  the leadership role. We fought for minimum wage. Nearly 13 million people  will enjoy the benefit of an increase in  the minimum wage.  We  fought  for  stem  cell  research  which provides Federal funding for research that has the potential to treat  sickle cell anemia, diabetes, paralysis,  Alzheimer’s  and  Parkinson’s.  And  many of these diseases are prevalent in  the African American community, and  we have been fighting for them.  We  fought about  student  loans.  I  heard on the news today that George  Washington University will be the first  university to publish that their tuition  and room and board is $55,000, and that  the largest increase in tuition is actually going to be in public universities,  not private universities. And we all  know that most working-class  folks  send their children to public universities, so we are happy to be in the  forefront of fighting for student loans.  We have also been pushing for disadvantaged businesses, disaster eligibility in light of what happened with  Hurricane Katrina. We fought for the  Katrina Housing Tax Relief Act of 2007.  We fought for United States Troop  Readiness, Veterans Health and Iraq  Accountability Act because we understand that there are young men and  women of all colors fighting over in  Iraq and Afghanistan. It is very, very  important that they have the ability to  have the kind of health care they need  and that this government be held accountable for their conduct.  We have fought for the Gulf Coast  Hurricane Housing Recovery Act because so many people were left out as  a result of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita.

2455,79,2007-10-22,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr. President, I appreciate the comments the Senator from  Iowa was making. I was not elected to  this body—I do not think the Senator  from Iowa was either—to make easy  votes. This can be a difficult vote.  There are programs on there that I  support, I support wholeheartedly, but  I want them to be effective. How can I  go back to my taxpayers in the State  of Colorado and  say: Well, we are  spending billions of dollars on this program, but it is ineffective. It is not  measuring up to the standards which  most businesses would be expected to  measure up  to  for performance, or  maybe other agencies are going  to  measure up to for performance.  I do not know how else to get the attention of the bureaucracy except to  deal with them where they pay attention. That is their pocketbooks, their  budget. I think when we have an ineffective program, we are not doing our  jobs as Senators if we do not figure out  a way to bring accountability to the  program.  Now, this is a modest attempt to try  to bring some accountability. We do  not eliminate any programs. We do a  reduction on a few programs that are  listed as ‘‘ineffective.’’  In the business world, they use the  same process that OMB puts in place.  This  is not a partisan process. You  know, you referred to President Bush’s  actions on it. It may be a Democratic  President 3 years from now. He is going  to be dealing with the same problems  this President is dealing with, that he  has programs out there that simply are  not measuring up.  So let me get back to what the standard business world does. They look at a  program and say: Well, look, we are  spending a certain amount of money,  and it is not performing. Because it is  not performing, we have either got to  redo the program, which is an option  the Congress can look at, or we eliminate it altogether, or we create some  other kind  of modification  that  is  going to make it accountable to the  stockholders of that company.  The stockholders in this case are the  taxpayers of the country. They are the  ones putting money in this program.  They are the ones who expect the program to do what it says, for what it is  set up to do. This is a program that has  been in place for 10 years. It is not a  new program.  The agencies have had plenty of time  to respond and react to this particular  effort. I would credit those agencies or  programs that are listed as ineffective  for at  least having tried to comply  with the law.  There is another group there I did  not address. There are those where results  have  not  been  demonstrated.  They are sort of thumbing their nose  at the Congress and saying: Heck, we  are not even going to bother to set up  any goals and objectives for our program. We are going to let it run on  auto.

If anyone has an amendment  they want to have offered, you would  be well advised to do it tonight or you  may not be able to do it tomorrow.  SANTASUSANAFIELDLABORATORY  ",2007
2457,86,2007-10-22,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  would  like to enter  into a colloquy  with Senators HARKIN and SPECTER  concerning my amendment to the underlying bill, amendment 3403, which  would provide compensation to qualifying individuals injured in the course  of employment at the Santa Susana  Field Laboratory  in California. This  amendment mirrors legislation I introduced in July to correct longstanding  injustices to these nuclear workers and  their families. Because of the revenue  impact of this amendment, I have chosen not to call it up at this time. However, the plight of the Santa Susana  Field Laboratory employees deserves  mention as we debate this important  bill.  In 1999, Congress approved the Energy  Employee  Occupational  Compensation Program to provide a $150,000  payment and medical benefits to workers who developed serious illnesses as a  result of their work for the Department of Energy. The program has been  plagued by slow processing times and  roundly  criticized  by  the  families  struggling to receive compensation for  the deaths of loved ones.  I believe it is the responsibility of  Congress to expand the Special Exposure  Cohort  to  include  qualifying  Santa Susana Field Laboratory employees.  This would  allow  eligible  claims to be compensated without the  completion of a radiation dose reconstruction or determination of the probability of causation. I would like to ask  Senator HARKIN the chairman of the  Appropriations Subcommittee Labor,  Health  and Human  Services,  Education, and Related Agencies, and Senator SPECTER, the ranking member of  this subcommittee, whether they agree  with me that Congress should expand  the Special Exposure Cohort so that  the claims of qualifying  individuals  can processed more efficiently?  ",2007
2458,86,2007-10-22,Mr. HARKIN.," I believe it is important to compensate workers who have  suffered as a result of their employment with the Department of Energy,  and although the Energy Employee Occupational Compensation Program provides a process for compensating these  victims, this process is often far too  burdensome.  ",2007
2459,86,2007-10-22,Mr. SPECTER., I agree with the senior Senator from California.  ,2007
2460,86,2007-10-22,Mrs.  FEINSTEIN.,"  Santa  Susana  Field Laboratory employees played a  significant role in keeping our Nation  secure during the Cold War era. For example, many of these workers were instrumental in developing our nuclear  weapons  program.  Unfortunately,  many workers were not aware of the  hazards at their workplace. Remarkably, no preventative equipment like  respirators, gloves, or body suits was  provided to workers.  Currently, over 600 claims for compensation have been  filed by Santa  Susana Field Lab workers. Ninety percent of those have been denied due to a  lack of documentation or their inability to prove that they meet exposure  thresholds. Santa Susana Field Lab  workers and their families are faced  with the burden of having to reconstruct exposure scenarios that existed  nearly 40 years ago, in most cases with  no records or documentation.  My amendment would cut the redtape by amending section 3621 of the  Energy Employee Occupational Compensation Program Act of 2000 to treat  employees of Santa Susana Field Laboratory as members of the Special Exposure Cohort. Individuals would be eligible for benefits if they worked at  Santa Susana Field Lab for a total of  250 days and developed a serious illness  that is known to be a result of exposure to radiation or other toxins at the  Lab before January 1, 2006.  Employees who contracted specified  cancers  from  exposure  to  radiation  would receive at least $150,000, and employees  exposed  to  toxic  chemicals  would  receive  $250,000. Additionally,  my amendment would allow previously  denied Santa Susana Field Lab claimants under the Energy Employee Occupational Compensation Program Act of  2000  the opportunity  to  reapply  for  compensation and medical benefits.  This is a matter that this body needs  to address before it is too late. Do the  chairman and ranking member of the  subcommittee agree?  ",2007
2461,86,2007-10-22,Mr. HARKIN., I agree with the remarks of the senior Senator from California.  ,2007
2462,86,2007-10-22,Mr. SPECTER., I agree.  ,2007
2463,86,2007-10-22,Mrs. FEINSTEIN., I thank my colleagues for their support. It is my hope  that the Senate will soon address this  matter so Santa Susana Field Laboratory workers and their families can finally receive the compensation they  deserve.  COPD  ,2007
2464,86,2007-10-22,Mr. CRAPO.," Mr. President, my distinguished friend and colleague from  Arkansas, Mrs. LINCOLN, and I rise to  engage our colleague from Iowa Chairman HARKIN and our colleague  from  Pennsylvania in a colloquy.  I would like to share with my colleagues a pressing health concern facing  the  American  public—COPD.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  or COPD, is a growing public health  threat  in America.  It  is the  fourth  leading cause of death in the U.S. and  is a major source of serious long-term  disability.  COPD  kills more  than  120,000 Americans each year—an average of one every 4 minutes.  Despite these alarming statistics, the  United States does not have a coordinated approach to tracking COPD morbidity and mortality  trends,  identifying people at risk for COPD and ensuring they are evaluated by their physicians, and educating the public about  the causes and symptoms of COPD.  ",2007
2465,86,2007-10-22,Mr. HARKIN.," I thank Senator CRAPO  for his remarks. I agree that COPD is  an important health threat facing the  American public. In part that is why  Senator SPECTER and  I have  fought  hard to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  to address COPD and other pressing  public health  issues. Since 2003, the  year after the NIH doubling was complete, funding into research on COPD  has continued to increase by $13 million  at  the National  Institutes  of  Health. The bill before us, our Senate  Labor-HHS bill includes a $4.4 million  increase for the CDC to work with at  least seven additional States in fiscal  year 2008 on preventing heart disease  and stroke. I am very proud of these increases and I thank my colleague Senator SPECTERfor helping to make them  possible.  ",2007
2466,86,2007-10-22,Mrs. LINCOLN.," I thank the chairman  for his thoughtfulness and dedication  and would like to recognize the leadership of my colleague from Idaho on this  important  issue.  I  share  Senator  CRAPO’s concern that COPD is a growing and  largely unrecognized health  problem in America. Today more than  12 million Americans are diagnosed  with COPD, and research published by  the CDC suggests that an additional 12  million Americans have undiagnosed  COPD. That is 12 million Americans  who have a debilitating and lethal disease but don’t know it.  Equally  alarming  is  the  impact  COPD is having on women. For several  years, COPD was largely considered a  disease of men. However, in 2000, the  mortality rate for women for COPD exceeded that of men. Today, COPD is an  equal opportunity killer.  I too am concerned that despite these  statistics, the U.S. does not have a coordinated public health strategy to address COPD. Senator CRAPO and  I  would like to urge the CDC to begin developing a COPD response plan.  ",2007
2467,86,2007-10-22,Mr. HARKIN., I thank the Senator  from Arkansas  for her consideration  and I assure her that I will work with  her and Senator CRAPO to ensure that  the CDC  is responsive to their concerns.  ,2007

2469,93,2007-10-22,Mr. CRAPO.," Madam President, an  Idahoan with the distinction, among  other things, of being the oldest fire  lookout in the Nation at age 89 retired  from that important post and from the  Federal Government  in  September.  James A. ‘‘Jim’’ Sheridan concluded a  long and dedicated career that began,  at age 53, what could be called a second  career in 1971, when he joined the Bureau of Land Management as a seasonal surveyor. In 1976, Jim became a  fire prevention patrolman, and, at age  67, became the Mount Harrison seasonal  lookout  in  the Sawtooth National Forest Minidoka Ranger District. Over the past 22 years, Jim has  provided a fire prevention message to  no  fewer than 35,000 national  forest  visitors.  As a lifelong rancher and 36-year veteran of Government service in the second half of his life, Jim has captured  the secret to staying young—that of  knowing you are never too old to start  something new. Jim’s life is a wonderful example of the fact that success  comes as the result of hard work. Idahoans who visited the Sawtooths were  both safer and better educated about  our rugged and beautiful natural resources as a result of Jim’s dedication  and efforts. I wish Jim and his family  well on his retirement, and I thank  him for his service to our Nation and  to Idaho.∑  f  FORT UNION NATIONAL  MONUMENT  ∑",2007
2470,93,2007-10-22,Mr. DOMENICI.," Madam President, I  would like to honor and give special attention to New Mexico’s Fort Union  National Monument in Mora County.  Located in the Mora Valley between  the Santa Fe and Sangre de Cristo  mountains, Fort Union established in  1851, dates back to New Mexico’s territorial days, protecting the area’s inhabitants and trade routes.  This year Fort Union has initiated a  new effort called  ‘‘The New Mexico  Volunteers Living History Program.’’  Volunteers in this program will depict  the Hispanic soldiers of the 1st New  Mexico Volunteers, who were enlisted  and stationed at Fort Union during the  Civil War. One of the current volunteers is a direct descendent of the 1st  New Mexico Volunteers. With  some  training and drilling, Fort Union hopes  to begin presenting living history programs depicting the 1st New Mexico  Volunteers in early spring next year at  Fort Union as well as other  local  venues. Fort Union has also reinstated  nighttime candlelight tours, and also  hopes to provide a public venue  for  night  sky viewing while partnering  with local colleges and universities to  interpret the skies, and be used as a  classroom  venue  complementing  science curriculums.  I am proud of the work being done at  Fort Union to reach out to the community and provide a glimpse of our historic past. The upcoming activities at  Fort Union remind us of our rich history in New Mexico, and I commend  the staff at the Fort for their efforts  and their hard work to further integrate the unique history of the Fort  into the surrounding area and expand  their role as a resource for local students and residents. I look forward to  the advancement of this program  in  the months to come.∑  f  HONORING EDWARD KOREN  ∑",2007
2471,93,2007-10-22,Mr. SANDERS.," Madam President,  today I acknowledge a Vermont artist  who is widely recognized and widely  loved, Edward Koren.  This year the Vermont Council on  the Arts is bestowing its Governor’s  Award for Excellence in the Arts on  this renowned graphic artist.  Mr. Koren carries on the long tradition of artists who publish their work  in the mass media, using the techniques of drawing to comment on the  lives that men and women lead. His  distinguished 19th century antecedents  include Honore´Daumier in France and  Thomas Nast in the United States. Edward Koren is a cartoonist of the first  order, having published more than 900  of his works in The New Yorker. His  cartoons have appeared in other publications as well, ranging from The Nation, to the New York Times.  His work is remarkably distinctive,  often focusing on shaggy figures engaged in everyday affairs. Their shaggy, hairy features are a personal signature; they embody the way he uses  lines, the way his pen moves on paper.  To see one of his cartoons on a page is  to  recognize  it,  instantly,  as  a  ‘‘Koren,’’ even before one knows  its  subject  or  reads  the  accompanying  words or his name at the bottom of the  cartoon.  Koren examines people in the midst  of everyday life, revealing that he understands that reality consists not of  something invented by movies or policy analysts but rather what we encounter every day. He is a satirist of  pretension, and deftly explores the neuroses of our times. Koren is a great  chronicler of what the poet Wallace  Stevens  called  ‘‘the malady of  the  quotidian.’’  David Remnick, editor of The New  Yorker, recently told the Burlington  Free Press that ‘‘Ed Koren is one of the  great original voices of cartooning . . ..  I love his work, always have.’’  Edward Koren’s work has been widely  recognized by museums as well as the  media which so often publish his cartoons. His work is in the Swann Collection at the Library of Congress, and  also in the permanent collections of  the Fogg Museum  at Harvard,  the  Princeton University Museum, and the  Fitzwilliam Museum  at  Cambridge  University.  Mr. Koren and his wife Curtis live in  central Vermont. He long ago moved to  our State for reasons he articulated recently:  I was captivated  intensely by Vermont.  There was a deep sense of community. I kept  thinking, this is unusual in this society, this  country. I had never come across this kind of  closely compacted community. I was fleeing  huge, giant-scaled cities without a real cohesive sense of place and connection. It turned  out I was a country guy.  Not surprisingly, Mr. Koren is a captain of the Brookfield, VT, Volunteer  Fire Department.  He is well deserving of the honor of  receiving the Governor’s Award for Excellence in the Arts.∑  f  REMEMBERING HARRY LEE  ∑",2007
2472,93,2007-10-22,Mr. VITTER.," Madam President,  I  wish to acknowledge the passing this  month of Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson  Parish, LA. Sheriff Harry Lee died of  leukemia on October 1, and I would  like to make a few remarks on his success and his contributions to the area.  Sheriff Harry Lee was elected in 1979,  beating  longtime  incumbent Alwynn  Cronvich and serving more than six  terms until his death. He was one of  the most popular, well-known politicians in the greater New Orleans area.  Throughout his career, Sheriff Harry  Lee devoted his life to fighting crime.  It  is perhaps Sheriff Harry Lee’s  colorful attitude that made him so beloved. While we often disagreed on  many issues, I have a great respect and  admiration for what Sheriff Harry Lee  accomplished in his long tenure. Harry  was a wonderful, gutsy, larger-than-life  figure who always did what he thought  was right. Whether I was agreeing with  him on crime-fighting  issues or disagreeing with him over Edwin Edwards, I always knew he was leading  with his passions and loyalties.  Thus, today, I rise to honor sheriff  Harry Lee that people may honor and  remember him for his devotion to the  State of Louisiana.∑  f  REPORT  RELATIVE  TO  THE  ISSUANCE  OF  AN  EXECUTIVE  ORDER TO EXPAND THE SCOPE  OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY  RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNMENT  OF BURMA, AS RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON OCTOBER 19, 2007—PM 29  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message  from  the President  of  the United  States, together with an accompanying  report; which was referred to the Committee  on  Banking,  Housing,  and  Urban Affairs:  To the Congress of the United States:  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Chad Block, businessman and volunteer firefighter, for his heroic acts on the afternoon of  March 24, 2007.  On this date Mr. Block passed by a car accident where a box van was on fire on Route  202 in Bucks County, PA. Acting quickly, Mr.  Block positioned his vehicle to prevent other  cars from reaching the fire. Suddenly, the fuel  tank exploded on the box van sending it down  the road  toward an outlet store  full of customers and workers.  Without hesitation or regard for his own life,  Mr. Block pulled a wheel chock from his own  truck and placed  it under  the wheel of  the  burning van stopping its movement. Moments  later, as the heat from the burning van overcame the wheel chock; the burning van began  to move again down the road. Without hesitation, Mr. Block placed his own truck in the  path of the burning van until fire crews could  secure the van and extinguish the fire.  Madam Speaker, Mr. Block’s bravery goes  above and beyond what we expect from our  citizens; but as a dedicated volunteer  firefighter with concern for the safety of his community, he acted fast and with great daring.  He acted without regard to his own life to ensure the safety of others. I urge my colleagues  to join me in recognizing Chad Block for his  heroism.  f  CONGRATULATING  THE  DALAI  LAMA  UPON  BEING  AWARDED  THE  CONGRESSIONAL  GOLD  MEDAL  HON. JOHN D.

2475,107,2007-10-22,Mr. MILLER of Florida.," Madam Speaker, on  behalf of the United States Congress, it is with  great honor that I rise today in recognition of  Helen Spencer, who for the last 40 years has  engaged  in committed, dutiful service  to  the  City of Fort Walton Beach, FL, as  the City  Clerk.  Helen Spencer’s  dedication  to  the City  began in 1967 when she became a secretary  in the Fort Walton Beach Police Department.  In 1970, she was promoted to stenographer.  In 1974 and for the next 7 years she was a  high  level secretary, and on April 29, 1981,  she was promoted to Executive Secretary for  the Fort Walton Beach Police Department.  When the position of City Clerk of Fort Walton  Beach was vacated she was quickly chosen to  fill the spot as interim city clerk. After only a  few months of service  to  the City,  the City  Council asked her to fill the position permanently.  As the city clerk, Mrs. Spencer manages a  multitude of functions. She oversees the official City records, prepares City elections, manages  the city’s  leases and deeds, and prepares countless minutes and agenda packages  for  the City Council. However, Mrs.  Spencer’s dedication to the community ranges  beyond her occupation. She participates on  the Local Issues Committee, the Greater Fort  Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce, and  serves as vice president of the Sugar Beach  Sertoma Club.  Madam Speaker, on behalf of  the United  States Congress,  I am proud  to  recognize  Helen Spencer on her 40th anniversary with  the City of Fort Walton Beach, FL. Mrs. Spencer  truly possesses an extraordinary understanding and a unique perspective of  the  City’s history. She is a committed, innovative,  and loyal resident of Fort Walton Beach, and  we are forever grateful for her service.  f  INTRODUCTION OF BILL ON PROTECTING CONSUMERS THROUGH  THE  PROPER  FORBEARANCE  PROCEDURES ACT OF 2007  HON. JOHN D. DINGELL  OFMICHIGAN  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Monday, October 22, 2007  ",2007
2476,107,2007-10-22,Mr. DINGELL.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  in  support of the bill entitled the ‘‘Protecting Consumers  through Proper Forbearance Procedures Act of 2007’’, which  I am  introducing  today. This  legislation  is  intended  to correct  persistent problems  in procedure created by  two words in the Communications Act of 1934,  as amended.  Section 10 of the Communications Act permits a telecommunications carrier to file a petition with  the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, asking the FCC to forbear from  applying certain statutory or regulatory requirements to it. The FCC may grant forbearance  if it finds that doing so is in the public interest.  It is certainly within the prerogative of Congress to create a statutory regime that permits  a regulatory agency to forbear from applying a  statutory requirement, so long as the agency  finds that consumers will continue to be protected and well served. The problem  in  this  circumstance is that the statute states that the  carrier’s petition will be ‘‘deemed granted’’ if  the FCC does not act within a prescribed timeframe. In other words, if the clock runs out before the FCC has reached agreement on the  merits of a petition, the petition is automatically granted.  This untenable situation must be corrected.  It can and has led to undesirable results.  First, the FCC last year permitted one forbearance petition  to be  ‘‘deemed granted’’  without  issuing  an  accompanying  written  order, thereby making it impossible for Congress or the courts to ascertain the scope of  relief granted or the legal rationale supporting  the agency action.  In  this situation, which  could easily occur again, it is difficult for Congress to conduct proper oversight of the implementation of the Communications Act, as well  as oversight of the telecommunications industry.  Second, the ‘‘deemed granted’’ language results in unsound decision-making at the FCC.  Faced with contentious, complicated issues as  set forth in these petitions, the FCC now routinely waits until the last possible minute—in  some cases literally the 11th hour—to make a  rushed decision. All  the while, during  the  FCC’s deliberations, the threat of an automatic  grant of forbearance from statutory provisions  hovers over  the proceedings. Such a disjointed process is not likely to result in public  policy that benefits consumers.  This bill simply removes the ‘‘deemed granted’’  language  from  the statute. Carriers are  still  free  to seek  forbearance, and  the FCC  may still grant forbearance where appropriate.  But the ‘‘deemed granted’’ language must be  removed to safeguard the ability of Congress  and  the courts  to conduct appropriate oversight,  to protect consumers, and  to  restore  transparency to the decision-making process.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF LAKEWOOD  HOSPITAL  HON.

2478,114,2007-10-22,Mr. THOMPSON  of Mississippi.," Madam  Speaker, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the nomination of Leslie Southwick,  now being considered by the U.S. Senate.  In an attempt, yet again, to place someone  for a lifetime seat on the Federal bench, which  has traditionally been racially ignorant and insensitive towards civil rights, the President has  risen  to  the occasion and nominated Leslie  Southwick.  This will be his third nomination, of a Mississippian,  to  the Fifth Circuit since 2001.  However, none of his nominations aid in rectifying the egregious problem with the lack of  diversity on Mississippi’s Federal bench.  Mississippi has  the highest African-American population, 37 percent, of any state in the  country. In spite of the hundreds of African-  American  lawyers and  judges  in Mississippi,  there has never been an African-American,  nor any other minority  from Mississippi, appointed  to represent Mississippi on  the Fifth  Circuit Court of Appeals in the history of this  country.  This is a fight worth having. The Fifth Circuit  has  the highest percentage of minority residents of any circuit. At the same time, its civil  rights jurisprudence is far to the right. The recent events in Jena, LA, show the racism in  the criminal justice system within the jurisdiction of  the Fifth Circuit. We cannot afford a  nominee hostile to civil rights on this or any  other Court.  There is a history with this seat. The President is intent on placing someone hostile to  civil  rights  in  the Mississippi seat on  this  Court. Charles Pickering and Michael Wallace  were nominated but couldn’t get confirmed because of their civil rights records. This is the  third try by the Administration, and the pattern  is very clear.  Instead of stepping up  to  the plate and  nominating someone capable of delivering fair  and  impartial decisions on civil  rights,  the  President has slapped Mississippians  in  the  face with the recent nomination of Southwick.  Just  look  to Southwick’s controversial opinions.  In Richmond v. MS Dep’t of Human Services, a white employee was fired for using the  phrase ‘‘good ole nigger’’ toward an African-  American  co-worker. When  the white employee was fired, a hearing officer reinstated  the employee. In upholding the reinstatement,  the majority  (which Southwick  joined) concluded that using the phrase ‘‘good ole nigger’’  was equivalent to calling the other employee  her ‘‘teacher’s pet.’’ This opinion was unanimously reversed by the Mississippi Supreme  Court. And this is Bush’s No. 1 draft pick?  Southwick’s rulings on race discrimination in  jury selections are equally disturbing. In such  cases there is a noticeable pattern of prejudice. Southwick upheld claims  that  the defense struck white jurors on the basis of their  race while rejecting claims that the prosecution was racially motivated in striking African-  American jurors. On one hand, Southwick allows prosecutors to strike African-American jurors when  the motivation  is  clearly  racial,  McWilliams v. Mississippi, or when the prosecution cites non-racial reasons for the strikes,  Davis v. Mississippi. Yet, Southwick denies  the defenses warranted attempts  to  strike  white jurors even when the defense uses the  same non-racial reasons for the strikes, Webb  v. Mississippi. And this is the President’s No.  1 draft pick?  The aforementioned cases exemplify several opportunities Southwick has had to make  a judicious decision befitting such a high court  but failed to do so.  Such views must not be tolerated or encouraged through a nomination to a lifelong post  representing the judicial integrity of our nation.  By  this nomination,  the Administration  is attempting  to  reward  judicious  incompetence  and great shortsightedness toward civil rights  issues.  It’s almost as if the President believes that  Mississippi does not have any competent African-American  lawyers. To  think  that a state  overflowing with highly capable African-American attorneys cannot fill this Mississippi seat  is simply preposterous.  Again,  I express my sincere opposition  to  the nomination of Leslie Southwick  to Mississippi’s Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mississippi needs a nominee who will not look to  discourage or impede its growth, but instead,  support and empower Mississippi’s legacy.  f  TRIBUTE TO HERBERT  HENDERSON  HON. NICK J.

2480,3,2007-10-31,Mr. POE.," Madam Speaker, the drug  smugglers have gotten smarter. They  now disguise vehicles they are using to  smuggle drugs into America to look exactly like Texas State transportation  trucks. They mask them with official  decals and even license plates; thus,  making it easier to bring drugs into  the United States.  Even though this criminal activity is  highly organized, at least 11 drug dealers have been captured bringing thousands of dollars worth of drugs into our  country using these fake State vehicles.  But when the U.S. Attorney prosecuted these criminals, they received  relatively light sentences. Some people  received only  fines. One received 24  months in prison, far less than the 11-  and  12-year  sentences  that Border  Agents Ramos and Compean received  when they were prosecuted by the same  U.S. Attorney  for wounding a drug  smuggler on the border.  The U.S. Attorney’s weak prosecution of drug smugglers is disturbing.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office seems to be  more interested in prosecuting border  agents than it is in prosecuting the  real criminals that bring drugs  into  our country. The overwhelming message here is that a measly fine is just  a  cost of doing business:  the drug  smuggling business in America.  And that’s just the way it is.  f  MISPLACED PRIORITIES  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and  was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)  ",2007
2481,3,2007-10-31,Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia.," Madam  Speaker, within the last month, the  American people have seen just how  misplaced President Bush’s priorities  are when it comes to addressing the  needs of hardworking Americans.  Earlier this month, the President vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have  provided  10 million children private  health  insurance through the SCHIP  program. The bill cost an additional $35  billion over the next 5 years, and would  have allowed us to receive 4 million  more uninsured children. Instead, the  President suggested a mere $5 billion  increase, which would  lead to more  than  800,000  children  losing  their  health insurance coverage.  Contrast that with the President’s  announcement last week that he was  requesting an additional $189 billion in  emergency funds over the next year for  the war in Iraq, which was $42 billion  higher than originally thought.  Fortunately, most Americans, Senators and Governors have caught on to  the President’s misplaced priorities.  But Republicans here in the House continue to blindly follow this President.  And just as they refused to join us last  week in standing by these 10 million  kids, House Republicans will most likely sign off on the President’s war funding request without ever asking a single question.  f  PRAYER BAN OVERTURNED  (Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to address the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2007
2482,3,2007-10-31,Mr. PENCE.," Madam Speaker, since  the American founding, acknowledging  God has been at the center of American  experience. Today, for example, Congress opened our day in prayer. And  thanks  to  the Seventh U.S. Circuit  Court of Appeals, the Indiana General  Assembly can open in prayer again.  In November of 2005, U.S. District  Judge David Hamilton ruled that opening prayers in the Indiana House of  Representatives  could  not mention  Jesus or endorse a particular religion.  Then-House Speaker Brian Bosma appealed the decision; and yesterday, in a  2–1 opinion, the court overruled that  decision.  I commend the Seventh U.S. Circuit  Court of Appeals, and I particularly  rise  to commend  the  tenacious and  principled leadership of Republican minority leader Brian Bosma. Because of  his efforts, Hoosiers can continue our  long tradition of acknowledging God in  the public square and in the well of the  people’s State House.  f  DEMOCRATS EXERCISE FISCAL  DISCIPLINE  (Mr. KLEIN of Florida asked and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2007
2483,3,2007-10-31,Mr. KLEIN of Florida.," Madam Speaker,  this  summer  the Democrat-led  House completed work on all 12 appropriations bills that fund the Federal  Government  for  the upcoming year.  Each bill restores fiscal responsibility,  ensures that taxpayer dollars are spent  wisely, and was passed with bipartisan  support. Our bills will not add money  to the Federal deficit because we kept  our promise to adhere to pay-as-you-go  rules.  Yesterday,  financial watchdogs,  including the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, the Concord Coalition  and the Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget praised the new Congress for our strict adherence to the  PAYGO rules.  Contrast that praise with the Bush  administration’s  record  of  turning  record surpluses  into record deficits.  President Bush has  borrowed more  money from foreign nations than all 42  of his predecessors combined.  Yet the President threatens to veto  our  appropriations  bills  because he  says they are excessive. Does he really  oppose important investments in veterans health care, pay raises for active  duty soldiers, funding for more cops on  our streets, and funding for life-saving  medical research?  Americans need to send a message to  President Bush to get his priorities  right.  f  NOT MUCH ACCOMPLISHED  (Mr. STEARNS asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)  ",2007
2484,3,2007-10-31,Mr. STEARNS.," Madam Speaker, an  analysis of the accomplishments under  Democrat control here in Congress for  the 110th Congress has shown that not  much has been accomplished. Let’s  take a look at it. There have been a  thousand votes taken this year. When  you look at those thousand votes, only  106 bills have been signed by the President. What are those bills? Well, 46  were naming of post offices, public  buildings and bridges. Not much accomplishment there. And 44 bills were  noncontroversial. Some were actually  Republican bills. They had strong bipartisan support.  Fourteen of these bills were reauthorization of existing law that the Republicans developed and were just continuing. And two substantial, serious  bills that passed this House, the FISA  bill and the Iraq supplemental, passed  without one member of the Democrat  leadership supporting it.  That  is all that has been accomplished, and I think the American people need to know. Lastly, not one appropriation bill has been sent to the  President and the fiscal year is already  over.  f  OUR CHILDREN’S HEALTH  (Mr.  CARNAHAN  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",2007
2485,3,2007-10-31,Mr. CARNAHAN.," Madam Speaker,  the Children’s Health Insurance Program is one of the most effective government programs of the last decade.  For an investment of just $3.50 a day,  we can ensure health care  for that  child who would otherwise fall through  the cracks because their family makes  too much for Medicaid but can’t afford  private health insurance.  This small cost is significantly less  than the cost we all bear when uninsured children fail to receive preventative care and end up in our emergency  rooms. Yet the President and about 10  of his Republican House supporters are  all that stand in the way of covering 10  million American children.  Our bipartisan legislation will allow  children who are already eligible for  the program to see the doctor of their  family’s choice so they don’t have to  resort to an emergency room for their  primary care.  Madam Speaker, it is time for our  Republican colleagues in this body to  join us in ensuring that all American  children have a healthy start in life.  The future success of our Nation depends on the health and well-being of  our children. It is time for the obstructionists to get out of the way. Let’s get  the job done.

2487,10,2007-10-31,Mr. DREIER.," Madam Speaker, we are  here discussing trade adjustment assistance, and it is designed to ensure  that, we as an institution, will have an  opportunity to, as I said earlier, open  up  those  very  important markets  around  the world. They’re  all  relatively small, and the United States of  America has a $13.3 trillion economy,  the largest economy the world has ever  known. We have lots of things that are  trade-related that are beneficial to the  United States of America. First and  foremost  is our national security.  I  think it is critical for us to proceed  with passage of the Panama, Peru and  Colombia free trade agreements for the  security of this hemisphere. Similarly,  the Korea agreement is very important  because we all know about the challenges that exist on the Korean peninsula, and engaging in greater economic  exchanges between and among these  countries is very important for our Nation’s security.  At the same time, Madam Speaker, it  is important that we do what we can to  ensure that we have the very important trade adjustment assistance  for  those Americans who are negatively  impacted by trade.  With that, I am going to urge a ‘‘no’’  vote on the previous question. And if  by chance the previous question proceeds, I am going to urge a ‘‘no’’ vote  on this rule because of the kinds of  things that the new majority is trying  to do to undermine the rights of nearly  half the American people.  With that, I yield back the balance of  my time.  ",2007
2488,10,2007-10-31,Mr. WELCH of Vermont.," I thank the  gentleman  from California, my good  friend and colleague on the Rules Committee,  for his kind words and his  usual vigorous argument for the point  of view represented on his side.  A couple of things. One, this is a good  opportunity for the House to have a  full and fair debate on the substance of  this legislation and on the substitute.  We will have that debate, we will have  the vote, and we’ll see which side prevails. So I am delighted that all Members of the House are going to have a  full and fair opportunity to make their  case.  Second, before we get to the specific  details on what is contained in this  trade adjustment assistance, there is  really a bottom line that has to be acknowledged and it’s this: that the road  to prosperity has to be built on a foundation of fairness. What has happened  in this country, despite the economic  growth of 3.9 percent most recently,  the highest gross domestic product in  the history of the world, over $13 trillion, is that average, everyday working  people are falling farther behind.  We have had the greatest disparity in  wealth in this country since the 1920s,  and there is a fundamental question  that we have to answer, and it’s this:  Are we going to include all Americans  in the benefits of a rising economy, or  are we going to pursue policies that  allow  for the  intensification of that  widening gap between the very wealthy  and everyone else?  Our party has made a commitment to  the basic proposition of democratic  fairness that requires everyone to have  an opportunity to participate in the  benefits of a rising and strengthening  economy. And that hasn’t happened.  But what we have done with the legislation we have brought before  this  House is essentially tried to build that  foundation of  fairness and provide a  new direction on our economic agenda,  one that includes all Americans.  Let me just give, Madam Speaker, a  few examples. We raised the minimum  wage, something that hadn’t been done  in over 10 years. We had people working harder, making less, many of them  paying more in taxes because of the Social Security  payroll  tax  increases  than at any time in history. In the average families, they found themselves  working two and three jobs in an effort  to pay the light bill, in an effort to pay  the fuel bill, losing health care.  We increased access to college education by taking a free ride away from  the international banks that were literally getting a taxpayer guarantee in  subsidized profits and gave that benefit  to students so that their student loans  were cut in half in the interest rate,  from 6.8 to 3.4. We passed the child  health care, which extends benefits to  working families, basically, to 10 million children throughout this country,  something our kids need.  b1130  And these are oftentimes the children of the working poor. These are  folks working hard. They would rather  not have to have any help, but they  can’t afford health care. We passed prescription drug price negotiation.  Instead of giving away guaranteed legislated profits to the drug companies,  we, in the House, it’s languishing in  the other body, required price negotiation so that we can get the benefit of  lower prices that we’re entitled to because of bulk purchasing.  We passed many provisions that are  going to strengthen our small businesses across this country because we  know the small business is a job creator. And we stood up to an administration, at a time when our veterans  and our soldiers are doing more for this  country than  in recent memory, by  passing  the highest  increase  in  the  budget for veterans in the history of  the Veterans Administration.  The bottom  line here  is that this  Congress, this leadership has made a  commitment to a new direction. And  the new direction is the old-time values of making certain that workers,  average  families,  and  communities  that are  fully engaged as American  citizens participate in the benefits of  our economy.  Trade adjustment assistance is one  more brick in that foundation of fairness. We can’t have trade agreements  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:39 Nov 01, 2007 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K31OC7.022 H31OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o l e o n c         ",2007
2489,52,2007-10-31,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  rise  in  strong support of the Trade and Globalization  Assistance Act so that all American workers  will be able to realize the benefits of the global  economy. H.R. 3920 will update our system of  trade adjustment assistance, TAA, to include  service sector employees, strengthen benefit  levels and duration, improve worker training,  and stimulate economic recovery  in affected  communities. These are needed changes  to  ensure that workers affected by globalization  are taken care of if their job is lost.  International trade is an essential part of the  American economy today and in the future. In  fact,  total U.S.  trade of goods and services  last year totaled $3.6 trillion. The reduction of  trade barriers in recent years has led to a corresponding  increase  in  trade volume,  to  the  benefit  of  both American  businesses  and  American consumers. Knowing that these benefits do not accrue evenly across all  industries, however, Congress established the TAA  program  to help  smooth  the  transition  for  workers who have to make the shift to a more  competitive field.  The safety net  for outsourced  jobs, which  consists of extended unemployment benefits,  worker training, and a health care tax credit,  was  first enacted  in 1962 and updated  in  2002. This update, however, did not go  far  enough to bring the program up to date with  current trade and labor realities. For one, the  benefits currently extend only to workers in the  manufacturing sector, despite the fact that a  growing percentage of  jobs shifted overseas  have been from the services sector, such as  telemarketing and financial services. Since the  nature of the American economy has moved  away from a reliance on manufacturing, it only  makes sense that workers in the services sector be eligible for the same support as industrial workers.  The bill makes a number of other changes  to strengthen TAA benefits,  including an  increase in the health care tax credit, an extension of  income support and  training period,  and a  large  increase  in  the overall  funding  level  to ensure  that no eligible worker  is  turned away due to lack of program funds.  But H.R. 3920 also takes the TAA program  beyond the effects on individual workers by offering new tax incentives for investment in distressed communities that have lost manufacturing jobs. The whole notion of worker assistance is meaningless without creating new jobs  for displaced employees. Targeting investment  into communities with an available workforce  would benefit employers and employees alike  and maintain vibrant towns and cities across  this Nation.  Finally, this bill considers the needs of the  larger Federal-State unemployment insurance  (UI) system by dedicating $100 million annually for the States to improve UI administration. Additional funding for this purpose would  also be available from Federal unemployment  trust funds. This money would be an incentive  for States to cover part-time, low-wage, and  other workers in State UI laws.  I look forward to passing this bill today in  anticipation of also passing pending  trade  deals  in  the coming weeks and months. By  giving our businesses the freedom they need  to sell American goods and services abroad,  we are ensuring that the American economy  will stay strong and competitive in the future.  By assuring our employees that there will always be a place for good American workers,  we will ensure a strong labor force capable of  evolving along with the global economy.  I support H.R. 3920, and  I urge my colleagues to vote for it today.  ",2007
2490,52,2007-10-31,Mr. PATRICK J.," MURPHY of Pennsylvania.  Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to support much-  needed economic redevelopment through the  Trade and Globalization Assistance Act. This  forwarding-thinking legislation will ensure that  America’s workers receive the training and assistance they need to compete in the global  economy.  Globalization has had a significant  impact  on the American workforce, but our national  policies have not kept pace with international  economic changes. Gone are the days when  men and women began and ended their careers at a steel or textile mill. Now, even customer service professionals and software engineers are losing jobs to overseas competition.  Thirty years ago,  in my district  in Bucks  County, Pennsylvania, more than 46,000 people were employed in manufacturing jobs. Like  many other working-class communities, my  district suffered severe job loss when foreign  competition  forced major employers  like US  Steel, Jones Apparel and Rohm and Haas to  shut-down most of their operations. By 2005,  manufacturing employment  in Bucks County  had fallen 34 percent. The departure of manufacturing  jobs  resulted  in vacant properties,  abandoned buildings and contaminated land—  and in Bristol, Pennsylvania, crumbling roads  and poor drainage put families at risk during a  recent  flood. But most of all,  the decline  in  manufacturing  jobs decline  left  thousands of  middle class workers out of a job.  Mr. Speaker,  the Trade and Globalization  Assistance Act makes substantial  improvements  to  the Trade Adjustment Assistance  Program and gives communities like mine a  chance.  Through the Manufacturing Redevelopment  Zone Program, this legislation will provide important tax incentives to cities and towns like  those  in my district  that have suffered substantial  reductions  in manufacturing employment. Communities designated as manufacturing redevelopment zones will have a second-chance to revitalize their economy by attracting new investments that will create family-sustaining jobs. This program will help lift-  up some of our Nation’s poorest communities,  but  it  is also a chance  to demonstrate our  commitment to American innovation.  While  towns  in my district still  face many  challenges, lower Bucks County has begun to  turn  the comer. Over  the past 5 years, we  have worked hard attract new  investment,  support workforce development and  improve  infrastructure.  The ongoing redevelopment at a former US  Steel site  is an outstanding example of my  community’s potential. Through incentives and  a commitment to revitalization, that site is now  home to a clean wind power manufacturer that  employs over 800 people. More high-tech,  green energy companies plan to open facilities  in  the near  future. We have made great  progress, but there is more work to be done.  The additional incentives provided under a  manufacturing zone designation would allow  towns in lower Bucks County to make infrastructure  improvements, cleanup brownfields,  attract  new  investments  and  create  jobs.  Through  ingenuity and good old  fashioned  American competitiveness we will move even  closer  to economic revitalization and energy  independence.  Mr. Speaker, Lower Bucks County has enormous potential and I pledge to do everything  I can to encourage economic growth and support middle class families in my district. Towns  in my district are still struggling and  I am  proud to partner local leaders and the business community to support economic development.  By passing this bill, we give hard working  Americans  the  support  they  need  and  strengthen a foundation for economic leadership. I urge my colleagues to support this critical piece of legislation.  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in support of H.R. 3920, The  Trade and Globalization Assistance Act of  2007,  introduced by my distinguished  colleague  from New York, Chairman RANGEL.  This  important  legislation updates and overhauls the antiquated Trade Assistance Act for  workers program of 1962.  In today’s globalized economy, no worker is  untouched by the phenomenon of the global  trade market. In 1962, when the Trade Assistance Act was conceived and implemented, the  status of American workers was much different than it is today. The existing and outdated legislation is marred with arbitrary eligibility criteria and inconsistencies as well as a  lack of coverage for workers in industries that  were not yet prominent.  Mr. Speaker,  the Trade and Globalization  Assistance Act of 2007, integrates all workers  whose efforts in building our global economy  make our economy  flourish within  the  international system. Coverage will now be granted  to workers in the service industry, which had  yet to significantly develop in the 1960’s, as  well as secondary and offshore workers. The  bill eliminates  restrictions, ensuring  that all  workers  impacted by  trade are covered, regardless of where the factory relocated to or  where the import competition came from. This  legislation will also ensure automatic certification for workers covered by ITC injury determinations, which is a major issue in the current economy  in which products and  technologies quickly are eclipsed and job security  is never ensured. Furthermore, this legislation  will work to synchronize the Trade Assistance  Act certification process which is currently on  a firm-by-firm basis. Consistency in our treatment of workers  is absolutely  imperative,  to  ensure we have an equitable system which  protects the backbone of our Nation.  The U.S. Chamber  of Commerce,  the  world’s  largest  business  federation  representing more than three million businesses  and organizations of every size, sector, and  region, has urged Congress to pass this legislation. As representatives of America’s workers, it is our duty to ensure that they receive  all the possible security and benefits of their  labor, especially in today’s unpredictable global economy. This bill extends TAA job training  and health benefits  to service workers who  lose their jobs due to global trade and covers  more manufacturing workers. It also dramatically improves TAA health care benefits and  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:42 Nov 01, 2007 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K31OC7.055 H31OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o l e o n c         ",2007

We  have not had that opportunity other  than the limited debate we had in committee and now here on the floor, and  we are hearing the same thing on the  floor we heard in committee and so we  haven’t  reconciled  those differences.

2507,94,2007-10-31,Mr. MCCRERY.," Oh, well, thank you  for the kind offer. I’m happy to close at  this time, Mr. Speaker.  I  think we’ve had a good debate  today on the different approaches that  the majority and minority have at this  point on the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. We certainly understand the  importance of providing an array of  benefits to people in this country who  lose their jobs because of trade, and  certainly Chairman RANGELand I have  talked and agreed that it’s necessary  for Congress to take action and to  make sure that people in this country  know that as we expand trade, that the  benefits of trade expansion will be uneven. And there will be some in this  country who will lose their jobs because of that expansion of trade, and  we need to be prepared to assure those  people that we will help them give  them that helping hand to lift them up  after they’ve  lost that  job and  find  training, education, whatever is necessary to get them a new job if they desire, and in the meantime give them  benefits that will allow them to take  care of themselves and their families.  So we agree on the importance of  this program. I had hoped we would  have had more give-and-take over the  last couple of months with respect to  crafting a bipartisan approach to reauthorizing the program, not only because the program was originally a bipartisan program, but also because we  are trying, some of us on both sides of  the aisle are trying to rebuild that bipartisan coalition for the expansion of  trade around the world, knocking down  trade barriers to our goods and services, to make the playing field more  level  for United States producers of  products and services. And as we attempt to create or recreate that bipartisan coalition  for the expansion of  trade, we understand that one leg of  that effort has got to be reauthorizing  and strengthening not only TAA, but  perhaps even going beyond the current  universe of beneficiaries of a Trade Adjustment Assistance program and looking at enhancing the benefits of all  workers who lose their jobs, not just  because of trade but perhaps due to  things that are more in the rubric of  globalization  but  not  specifically  trade.  So I’m glad that we have this bill before the House today. I’m hopeful that  we can reauthorize in some form this  very important program before the end  of this year. I regret that I cannot support the majority bill that’s on the  floor today. I think we have offered a  reasonable substitute and I’m hopeful  that the House will adopt our substitute, and then as the process moves  through the Senate and to the President, we can perhaps refine that product some more and get a bipartisan  agreement.  So with that, Mr. Speaker, I urge  adoption of the substitute.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.  ",2007

For a  long time, unfortunately, Mr.  Speaker, trade policy has focused more  on opening new markets and has dismissed the real consequences of those  faced by those who lose their jobs as  well  as  their  communities  across  America that are hard hit.  Democrats recognize that our economic future rests with our ability to  open new markets for U.S. goods, especially since our markets are already  largely open to our trading partners.  However, the status quo is not working, and we must do much more to help  American workers compete and thrive  in the increasingly competitive global  market. That is the purpose of this important legislation before us, the trade  adjustment assistance bill.  Mr. Speaker, being from Massachusetts, I’m sure you’ve read in the history books, for somebody of my age I  recall, when President Kennedy called  for the, called upon the American people with his challenge to put a man on  the Moon and have him safely return  within 10 years. It was very, very exciting. It was almost unbelievable, but it  did happen. Why I mention it, though,  is because in his remarks at that time,  President Kennedy said, if we are to  honor the vows of our Founders, we  must be first, and therefore we intend  to be first. For our science and industry, for peace and security, we must be  first. And that’s what this  is about  today, how America can continue to be  number one.  We have worked together with that  Innovation Agenda in that spirit; the  Innovation Agenda, much of which has  been passed overwhelmingly in a bipartisan way by the Congress and signed  into law by President Bush. And it will  help promote, will make serious and  sustained investments in research and  development, help promote the public-  private partnerships that will develop  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:42 Nov 01, 2007 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K31OC7.074 H31OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o l e o n c         ",2007
2510,101,2007-10-31,Mr. WICKER.," Madam Speaker, this  really is an unprecedented move. We  were originally told that it would be  scheduled for first thing this morning.  Then it was rescheduled for early this  afternoon. And once again, the matter  was so controversial that it had to be  pulled again and we find ourselves discussing it now at this moment.  I frankly wish my friend from Wisconsin would pull the motion again, because there is only one way to understand this process. This is, as the Republican leader said, a political stunt.  If it is allowed to proceed, the result  will be predictable. The President will  veto  the product of  this conference  committee, because it will attempt to  spend billions and billions of new dollars on domestic programs we cannot  afford, just when a balanced budget is  within sight again. The President will  veto the bill, the President’s veto will  be sustained, and we will be back to  the drawing board.  While all of this is unfolding, much-  needed funds for our veterans clinics  and for our servicemembers and their  families will be delayed, not to mention essential funding for our Nation’s  defense in the global war on terror, for  our troops in combat in Afghanistan  and Iraq who are risking their lives for  our country even as we speak. These  key national security expenditures will  have to wait even  longer than they  have already waited.  The other result of this process will  be just as predictable. Some people in  this town, in this very House, will have  gotten what they wanted: more political theater, more attempts to  link  good policy with excessive spending in  an attempt to score political points.  Madam Speaker,  does  the Democratic leadership of this Congress want  to pass appropriation bills or do they  just want to make new campaign commercials?  Four and one-half months ago the  House of Representatives passed the  Military Construction-VA bill with an  overwhelming 409 votes. The Senate  passed its version of MilCon-VA with  only one dissenting vote on September  6, 8 weeks ago. The President has expressed his willingness to sign the bill.  Mr. EDWARDSand I, along with our subcommittee, have stood ready to go to  conference for almost 2 months. Why,  other than politics, have these funds  for military quality of life and for our  Nation’s veterans been delayed?  Mr. EDWARDSand I, as chairman and  ranking member, have worked along  with our Senate counterparts and our  staffs to craft a compromise between  the two versions of MilCon-VA. Only a  few outstanding issues remain. We are  ready to go with this essential bill. The  same is true for the Defense appropriations bill.  That means we could have bills on  the President’s desk within a matter of  I  days. Funds for vital infrastructure for  our troops, child development centers  and veterans programs could be in the  pipeline within a matter of days. Do we  really want to hold our present and  former  troops hostage  for  political  games?  So I urge my friends on the other  side the aisle to reconsider this unprecedented maneuver. Send the bills by  regular order according to the established rules. Let’s get the funds to our  troops without further delay.  ",2007

2513,101,2007-10-31,Mr. HUNTER.," Madam Speaker,  want to thank my friend for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I think this is a sad  day for our country, because we put  into place several years ago what we  called a bridge  fund.  I call  it  the  ammo, the armor, the equipment fund.  That was a fund that we added to the  Defense bill to carry our troops over  during the winter months before that  spring supplemental, before that extra  funding came about in the springtime  of the next year.  That is important for them, and that  gave them a certain confidence level  that they were going to be funded without having to take money out of the  cash register for the next year, have to  delay training exercises, have to delay  the equipping of forces back here in the  United States.  And you know something? We had a  bill that was ready to go here. The Defense appropriations bill is something  that clearly would sail through, the  President would sign it, and there was  no risk in this bill that would fund our  operations and our warfighting in Iraq  and Afghanistan.  The Democrat leadership now has injected risk, because you have hooked it  up with a bill that the President said  he is going to veto. That injects risk  into this very, very difficult operation.  So what do we have with our soldiers,  our sailors, our airmen, our marines in  Afghanistan and Iraq? We have got the  uncertainties of war, the dangers of  war. We have got the uncertainties  that attend their families back here in  the United States. And now the Democrat  leadership has  injected another  uncertainty, an uncertainty that they  will be funded fully in these difficult  months.  b1615  So you took away this bridge fund,  what I call the ammo, the armor, the  equipment fund, and the answer you  have given us is, well, if the President  caves, then the troops will get the  money. Holding our troops, our forces,  hostage during a time of war is something that this body has never done.  I would hope that the Democrat leadership would make an about-face on  this. I would hope you would adopt the  great position of Democrat Senator  Henry ‘‘Scoop’’ Jackson, who said, ‘‘In  time of war, the best politics is no politics.’’  ",2007
2514,101,2007-10-31,Mr. OBEY.," Madam Speaker, I yield  myself 1 minute.  I yield myself the time simply to respond to something said by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. WICKER).  Mr. WICKERimplied that the delay that  took place in bringing this to the floor  today was because of supposedly some  turmoil about how this bill was packaged.  In fact, as the gentleman from New  York (Mr. WALSH) will tell you, the  reason for the delay is because I spent  all  day  defending  two  Republican  amendments to this bill that the Senate wanted to reject. And until I got  agreement to quit horsing around with  those amendments, I refused to bring  this bill to the floor.  And now I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman  from  Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO).  ",2007
2515,101,2007-10-31,Ms. DELAURO.," It really is disingenuous when I  listen to my colleague  from  California  talk  about  ammo,  armor and equipment from the folks  who  brought  our  young men  and  women  into a battle without appropriate ammo, without armor, and without  the appropriate equipment  that  they needed to be able to fight this war  from the outset. In fact, it has been the  Democratic majority over and over and  over again who have  increased that  funding for our troops in the field.  Let me also say to our distinguished  minority leader, and you should not be  fooled by the commentary, this issue is  about  the Labor, Health, Education  and Human Services bill. And the folks  who are playing games are the minority and the Republicans on that side of  the aisle.  This is bill where we know that we  will  increase  funding  for  veterans  health care, offer pay raises for active  duty soldiers, provide additional support for military families. Let me just  tell you what this President wants to  veto: the investment in lifesaving medical research, the  investment  in  increased  education  funding,  and  he  would like to veto our being able to  strengthen job training in this Nation.  Two or three examples, my friends.  The President’s budget cuts funding for  medical research at the National Institutes of Health. He would cut that by  $480 million. That is 800 fewer research  grants than last year to study deadly  diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s, leukemia, Parkinson’s, heart disease. We  rejected that on our side of the aisle.  We invest $1 billion above the President’s request or roughly the cost of  three days  in Iraq. That’s what the  President wants to veto.  Let’s take a look at the Centers for  Disease Control. When the chairwoman  testified before the committee, she said  we face as a nation the issue of the  daily health challenges: 4 million seniors living with Alzheimer’s, 583 women  diagnosed with breast cancer every single day, and  176,000  teens who will  VerDate Aug 31 2005  01:42 Nov 01, 2007 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00101 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\K31OC7.102 H31OCPT1 E S U O H h t i w 0 6 C P D O R P n o l e o n c         ",2007

I am not  proud, however, that we have gone this  long into the year without a single appropriations bill.

",2007
2519,108,2007-10-31,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Mr.  Speaker,  we’ve been here before. In the 1920s,  America spied on its citizens and arrested thousands because they advocated for change. In the 1950s, America  black-listed innocent Americans whose  only crime was to run afoul of Senator  Joe McCarthy. In the 1970s, America illegally spied on people  in the civil  rights and the Vietnam antiwar movements,  including Dr. Martin Luther  King.  The transgressions were so egregious  that  a  courageous  Senator  Frank  Church  from Idaho  led a search  for  truth and affirmation of freedom. In  the end, the Congress passed FISA, the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  FISA  provides  a  swift  and  certain  means for America to meet any threat  without  threatening America’s  freedoms. But this administration seems it  cannot defend America without demolishing America’s freedoms.  The President wants the Congress to  undermine FISA with new legislation  that would make it easy to spy on any  American, just like the 1920s, the 1950s  and the 1970s. These are not the good  old days, and I oppose any attempt to  use fear to subvert freedom.  We can keep America safe without  sacrificing America in the process. I  urge my colleagues to remember why  FISA was created and why we should  not neuter it in the near future.  f  f  138 DAYS, NO VETERANS BILL  (Mr. BOOZMAN asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

As of today, we have gone 138 days in  this Chamber with no action, no plan  of action, and more importantly, no  veterans bill. I am concerned that we  have a $4.4 billion increase in veterans  health care collecting dust on someone’s desk in this very building.

Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr.  Speaker, today the House passed the  Trade and Globalization Assistance Act  of 2007, and I was very proud to support  this legislation. And I thank Chairman  RANGELand, of course, Chairman MILLERfor their insight.  A  couple of years ago, when we  moved on the permanent normal trade  relations with China, I worked with the  then-Clinton administration  to craft  an executive order that addressed the  question of the loss of jobs when there  was a trade bill. We thought that this  particular executive order could  lay  the groundwork for providing for small  businesses and those various sectors of  the country that would lose their employment  or  their  economic  opportunity. Well, look at the trade imbalance now. This is a forthright bill that  expands the opportunities for service  workers, manufacturers, insists on enrollment opportunities, and it is a good  start.  I don’t know what the journey will be  on future trade bills, but America has  to start standing up for its own workers, its own regions, and making sure  that small businesses do not lose their  economic opportunity simply because  we want to engage  in globalization.  Globalization may be good, but Americans have to be protected, and I was  very glad to vote for this legislation  today.  f  b1745  AUTHORIZING  THE  CLERK  TO  MAKE  CORRECTIONS  IN  ENGROSSMENT OF H.R. 3920, TRADE  AND  GLOBALIZATION  ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007  Mrs. MCCARTHY of New York.

That is what we have seen in this  Congress, Mr. Speaker, is bill after bill  after bill with more spending and more  spending and more spending. And  it  will drive, it has to drive, increased  taxes. So what we have seen is a proposal from not just a back-bencher, not  just somebody who took some wild hair  and decided that they were going to  propose a tax  increase; the proposal  comes from the chairman of the Ways  and Means Committee, the tax writing  committee. And in fact the Speaker in  her first comments about it said she  supported it.  Mr. Speaker, on Halloween, you talk  about something that  is  frightening.  As my friend from California said, that  is frightening, to have the Speaker and  the chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee supporting a $3.5 trillion  tax increase, the largest tax increase in  the history of our Nation, on individuals.  My good friend from California, I am  pleased to yield.  ",2007
2528,129,2007-10-31,Mr. MCCARTHY of California.," My  good friend from Georgia, I appreciate  your yielding. You are talking about  spending and you are talking about  how much it has increased.  The American public would say before you raise my taxes, have you cut  the waste, the fraud and abuse? You  just  talked  about  the  chairman  of  Ways and Means. You look at the tax  increase he proposed and you wonder  why does he want to increase taxes so  much?  I look back and I remember on this  floor when we were bringing up the  Health and Human Services bill.  In  there, you thought you were going to  talk about the needs and the other  things.  There was an amendment in there. I  remember the debate on the Republican  side, Mr. Speaker, because  in  there, there was put in what is called  an earmark for $2 million for a library  which the college didn’t ask for to be  named after the chairman of Ways and  Means. It was interesting to me, I call  it  ‘‘the monument  to me,’’ because  that is exactly what it is. The American people need their taxes raised so  somebody on this floor can name a library after themselves for $2 million?  And if you look at the brochure, it says  it will be just as nice as President Clinton or President Carter, which I will  tell the American people, Mr. Speaker,  were paid for by private funds.  When it was challenged on the side of  the Republicans to say maybe that earmark is not right because it didn’t go  through the process, the chairman of  Ways and Means came to the floor and  defended  it and said he deserved  it.  When someone said, Well, maybe you  shouldn’t name  it after yourself, he  talked about it and said, No, I have  been able to raise $25 million from corporations to go through it. Then when  he sat there and talked and they said,  Well, maybe we should name one after  ourselves, he said, No, no, you don’t deserve it.  But that is the hypocrisy that goes  on on this floor of the Congress. When  you continue to spend, when you continue to move earmarks and you think  you can just tax the American public  more and more, they are going to wake  up. That is why I appreciate the time  you have taken, the Truth Squad, to  let people know what goes on on this  floor.  b2015  Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the American people for scaring them too much,  but this is the truth, and I yield back  to my good friend from Georgia.

And the frustrating  part is when you have the President of  the United States have a series of comments throughout his administration  that have basically, you know, simplified all of these issues. You know,  after 9/11 the big great challenge he  gave us, Mr. Speaker, was to go shopping. You know, we try to pass children’s health care and he says, well,  you can get health care at the emergency room.

We have the fruits of the  new direction here in these very new  Members of Congress as it relates to  the majority makers giving us, empowering those of us that have been here,  and they’re bringing ideas to the table  as it relates to moving in a new direction. If I was the President, I would try  to, you know, shut off the light bill  over here at the Capitol so that we can  stop working so that we can stop uncovering half of what’s going on.  I mean, Mr. RYAN, you gave one, you  have one of the best clips on YouTube  saying this is the same administration,  and he goes down  the  line because  someone on the floor, I think, last year  or the year before last criticized Democrats  for questioning  the President.  And Mr. RYANsaid, I’m sorry, but this  is the same administration that told us  that we had to go to war, weapons of  mass destruction. This is the same administration that outed a CIA agent. I  mean, this is proven stuff. This is not  fiction. This is fact. And I always say,  gentlemen and ladies, that when people  look back on this period, they’re going  to see who was actually about the solution and who was actually validating  what  the  administration  has  been  doing. And I think that it’s important  for us to have this balance. And I think  it’s important for us because we, the  four of us here on this floor right now,  we’re just like every other Joe and Sue  out there.

And  you know,  I carried  luggage,  ‘‘Yes,  sir,’’  ‘‘No, sir.’’ I went out and patrolled the highways and byways in the  State of Florida and offered myself to  be a State Representative.  b2115  I had a district office right there and  went to Tallahassee and did what I had  to do. Many of you, the same track as  it relates to the State legislature or  local elected officials, and we heard  this. So now we’re the same old Joe  that left our local districts. Now we are  in Congress, and we are going to ask  the questions that the people that we  represent will ask us. When I go home  and I go to the grocery store, people  ask me, What is going on? What do you  mean? The President doesn’t want it to  happen. I said, it’s not about the President’s  standing  against  children’s  health  care  insurance;  it’s  about  enough Republicans on the other side  of the aisle that are standing with him,  and that’s what it’s about.  And so I think it’s important, gentlemen, that we  look at  it  from that  standpoint. The President is not running for reelection, but there are Members of Congress that are running for  reelection. And it should not be a secret that come next November on a  Tuesday morning or before as it relates  to early voting, absentee voting, people  will be able to stand in judgment of the  individuals that are validating what  the President is saying.  So it’s really like which side of the  ball are you on? Are you on the side of  fiction or are you on the side of fact?  The fact is about accomplishing things  with  the Democratic majority  and  some Republicans joining us in that effort, which I enjoy because we talk  about bipartisanship and we are actually doing it, or those that are saying  we have to stand in the way because we  can’t allow the American people to see  a Congress that’s functioning and questioning the executive branch.  ",2007
2533,136,2007-10-31,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," Can I make a  point too? And I want to say this because we all have a lot of good friends  who are on the other side who have  voted for the Labor-Health-Education  appropriations bill, voted for defense,  voted for the vets; and the argument  being made today was that somehow  this was unique that we are putting  several appropriations bills together. If  you ask people  in our districts, the  whole process is foreign to them anyway. It’s just get the job done. And  when we look back at our Republicans  friends, Mr. Speaker, when they were  in charge, on 59 different occasions,  had put bills together like we’re trying  to do. And so I think it’s important.  We are trying to get the job done. But  this is not every Republican. This is, in  my estimation, some very fringe, extreme members  of  the Republican  Party who are basically backing the  President on these things, and he has  just enough Members on the Republican side to sustain a veto.

But  you  talked  about  combining  these appropriations bills and the criticism that we received from the other  side. I wanted to remind my colleagues  of the last time that this happened. It  was very recently. We shouldn’t need  to remind them. It was just in February. And the reason we had to combine nine appropriations bills from last  year in this session of Congress was because, after the outcome of the elections in 2006, the Republican Congress  said, I’m done, I’m going home. I don’t  care about these nine appropriations  bills. We’ll leave it for the next group  to fix. And that is what we had to deal  with when we came in, nine appropriations bills that were not completed  from the previous fiscal year. We were  in the current fiscal year doing last  year’s work. So I couldn’t believe what  I was hearing today on the floor when  we were being criticized for combining  three appropriations bills in the current fiscal year when they left us with  nine bills incomplete that we had to  deal with.  ",2007
2537,136,2007-10-31,Mr. RYAN of Ohio.," It’s the same disjointed kind of argument  that  the  President, Mr. Speaker, has given us on  the SCHIP bill. This is 10 million kids,  $35 billion over 5 years. We could pay  for these 10 million kids to get health  care for a whole year for 40 days in  Iraq. And the President, who has run  up $3 trillion in debt, borrowed it from  China, raised the debt limit five times,  is now going to draw the line in the  sand on fiscal responsibility on 40 days  in Iraq to provide health care for 10  million kids. I mean, there are so many  disjointed  arguments  and  floating  pieces that are going around here that  just don’t make a whole lot of sense to  many of us.  I hope that we can try to continue to  push to get more Members on the other  side of the aisle to join with us to do  some  pretty  basic  things  that  the  American people want us to do.  ",2007

2541,150,2007-10-31,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, I wish to  be associated with the remarks of the  distinguished Senator from Arizona. I  think he summed it up pretty well, but  let me just make some comments myself about the Mukasey nomination.  Just when you thought it might be  safe to venture back into the confirmation water, the partisan sharks rush in  and push you  right back onto  the  beach. Today is 40 days—40 days—since  the Senate received the nomination of  Judge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney  General of the United States, 40 days in  the partisan wilderness for a man who  is superbly qualified and widely respected  and whose  service  is  desperately needed.  Before addressing what is being done  to Judge Mukasey, let me remind my  colleagues who he is. Michael Mukasey  has spent four decades serving the law  and the country. He spent 16 years in  private legal practice, 4 years as a Federal prosecutor, and 19 years as a Federal district court judge. He was head  of the Official Corruption Unit during  his service as assistant U.S. attorney  and chief judge during his last 6 years  as a U.S. district judge, both in the  Southern District of New York.  Judge Mukasey’s service in that particular jurisdiction gave him the expertise  in national security  issues that  makes him especially qualified to lead  a Justice Department that is being retooled for the war on terrorism and especially since the war on terrorism  continues as we  stand here on  the  floor. He presided over the 9-month  trial of Omar Abdel Rahman and sentenced him to life in prison for the 1993  plot to blow up the World Trade Center.  When the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the Second Circuit  affirmed  Judge  Mukasey’s decision,  it took the unusual step of commenting on how he  handled the trial. These are the appeals  court’s words. Judge Mukasey:  . . . presided with extraordinary skill and  patience, assuring fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant and helpfulness  to the jury. His was an outstanding achievement in the face of challenges far beyond  those normally endured by a trial judge.  That was the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit on August 16,  1999.  That is a remarkable statement. Appeals courts review district court decisions, but rarely do they comment in  this manner on district court judges.  Both generally and specifically, by  any reasonable or objective standard,  Judge Mukasey is eminently qualified  to be our next Attorney General. By  the standards set by my Democratic  colleagues themselves, Judge Mukasey  should by now have become Attorney  General Mukasey. My Democratic colleagues have repeatedly said that the  Justice Department needs new leadership and needs  it now. The Senator  from New York, Mr. SCHUMER, whom  my colleague from Arizona quoted, is a  Judiciary Committee member and a serious one. He has said:  We can’t afford to wait because justice is  too important.  He is not alone in making that statement  among  the  Democrats.  The  Democratic mantra is, justice is too  important to wait; we need a new Attorney General now. My Democratic  colleagues also offered criteria, offered  a description of the kind of Attorney  General we need right away. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator LEAHY, said:  We want the best man or woman who can  run the place, restore the sense of commitment and restore the sense of integrity to  the Department of Justice.  The Senator  from New York, Mr.  SCHUMER, who knows him well, said the  nominee would have to be someone of  unimpeachable  integrity,  experience,  and someone who could hit the ground  running.  I respectfully say to my Democratic  colleagues  that Judge Mukasey  fits  your bill. He can run the place. He is a  man of  integrity and experience. He  certainly can hit the ground running.  It appeared for a short, brief time  that  my  Democratic  colleagues  thought so too. After a full day of testimony, Chairman LEAHY told Judge  Mukasey that his answers showed his  independence and his agreement that  political influence has no place in law  enforcement.  Mr. SCHUMER, the distinguished Senator from New York, said:  The most important qualities we need in  an Attorney General right now are independence and  integrity, and  looking at Judge  Mukasey’s career and his interviews that we  have all had with him, it seems clear that  Judge Mukasey possesses  these vital attributes.  I ask unanimous consent that these  and some other quotes be printed in  the RECORDfollowing my remarks.  ",2007

2543,150,2007-10-31,Mr. HATCH.," We need a new Attorney  General now. In fact, we needed him 40  days ago. Justice is too important to  wait. Judge Mukasey meets the criteria. He is qualified. He is ready to  lead. Then why is Judge Mukasey not  already on the job leading the Justice  Department to where Americans think  it needs to be? Why is his nomination  stalled, 40 days into the confirmation  process, without  even  a  committee  vote?  It is certainly not because this is the  way Attorney General nominees have  been treated in the past. In my 31 years  in this body, we have taken an average  of 3 weeks to move an Attorney General nominee from nomination to confirmation. It has already been twice  that  long—40 days and counting—for  Judge Mukasey, and he was only today  put on the Judiciary Committee agenda for next week.  Let me  rewind  the  confirmation  clock to 1993, the last time a Democratic Senate evaluated a nominee for  Attorney General. Janet Reno,  the  Democratic nominee, received very different treatment than this Republican  nominee  is  receiving  today. Miss  Reno’s nomination went through the  entire confirmation process from initial receipt to  final confirmation  in  less time than Judge Mukasey’s nomination has been sitting in the Judiciary Committee since this hearing.  While the Judiciary Committee will  not  vote  on Mukasey’s nomination  until at  least next week,  the committee did not even wait for a markup  to approve the Reno nomination.

2549,157,2007-10-31,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, I wanted to speak about the subject I referenced briefly, and that is fiscal policy and this President. It gives me no  joy to come and be critical of the  President’s fiscal policy. But it should  give the American people no joy either  to understand the consequences of a  fiscal policy that turned very  large  budget surpluses, which took us a long  time to begin to see, into very long-  term Federal budget deficits and three  trillion dollars of additional debt. That  is a reckless fiscal policy and one that  has to be fixed.  When he recently asked the Congress  for an additional $196 billion—none of  it paid for, all emergency—the President said: Now we will see whether the  Congress supports the troops. Well, the  fact is, not all that money goes to the  troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. A substantial portion of that money goes to  contractors.  I wanted to go through with my colleagues some examples of what we are  finding with respect to the spending of  taxpayers’ money for contractors. I believe I have held 17 hearings over the  recent 4 years as chairman of the Policy Committee on these issues.  Let me put up a couple of charts to  describe where we are headed.  This is a Congressional Budget Office  estimate of October of this year. The  U.S. wars  in  Iraq and Afghanistan  could cost taxpayers a total of $2.4 trillion by 2017 when you count the very  large  interest costs because  this  is  being financed with borrowed money.  Again, a President who says he is a  conservative  borrowing  all  of  this  money,  insisting  it be borrowed and  not paid for, and we end up in this  country paying a fortune for the war  costs.  So the question is, is this money for  the troops? Well, let me describe what  we have. Last month, military officials  said contracts worth $6 billion to provide  essential  supplies  to American  troops in Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan—including food, water, and shelter—were under review by criminal investigators. In addition, $88 billion in  contracts  and  programs,  including  those for body armor for soldiers and  material for Iraqi and Afghan security  forces, are being audited for financial  irregularities.  Think of that: $88 billion; $6 billion  under criminal investigation; $88 billion, financial irregularities by these  contractors.  Once again, under this President, last  month the Army reported that it had  78 cases of fraud and corruption under  investigation, had obtained 20 criminal  indictments, and had uncovered over  $15 million in bribes.  Another $196 billion, while those who  prance around this money have a field  day. It doesn’t seem like conservatism  to me.  Again, in August, 2 months ago, the  New York Times reported:  The enormous expenditures of American  and Iraqi money on the Iraq reconstruction  program, at least $40 billion over all, have  been criticized for reasons that go well beyond the corruption cases that have been uncovered so far. Weak oversight, poor planning, and endless security problems have  contributed to many of the program failures.  So we  ante up money  from  the  United States Congress—billions and  billions of dollars. We are going to provide health care clinics for the Iraqis.  We are going to build 142 health care  clinics. We hire the contractor. The  money is gone, but the clinics aren’t  there. An Iraqi doctor—a very courageous Iraqi doctor—testified at one of  my hearings. He said: I went to the  Health Minister in Iraq and said: You  know, we had these contracts with an  American contracting company  that  was going to do these 142 health care  clinics in Iraq. I would like to visit  them. The Iraqi Health Minister said to  this physician: You don’t understand.  Most of those are imaginary clinics.  Well,  the American  taxpayer  got  fleeced. The money is gone. The contractor got  the money. The clinics  don’t exist.  We can’t even keep track of the guns  that are being sent to Iraq. We sent  Iraq 185,000 AK–47s, and at this point  we know where  75,000 of  them are;  110,000 are gone and unaccounted for.  We sent them 170,000 pistols, 90,000 of  them we can’t account for. Are some of  these AK–47s and pistols being aimed  at American troops? Of course they  are. How is it that we fund with American taxpayers’ money the shipment of  massive quantities of weapons to Iraq  and don’t keep track of where they  are? Again, there are 110,000 AK–47s, we  don’t know where they are, and 80,000  pistols, we don’t know where they are.  This  is  almost  staggering  incompetence, in my judgment.  Saddam Hussein  is dead. He was  hanged by the neck. The Iraqi people  no  longer have Saddam Hussein  in  their lives. The Iraqi people voted for  their own new constitution, and they  voted for a new government. All that is  left for the Iraqi people is to provide  for their own security. The question is,  when will the Iraqi people demonstrate  the will to provide for their own security?  We have trained 360,000 Iraqis in the  interior forces and defense forces, soldiers and police men and women—  360,000 have been  trained, and  they  can’t provide for their own defense, for  their own security. Is there not a will  in this country in which Saddam Hussein is gone, a new constitution, a new  government  exists,  and  they  have  360,000 people trained, and that training was paid for by this country—is  there not a will, then, to provide for security? If they can’t, we can’t. We are  not going to provide security in Iraq  for the next 5 or 10 years. We should  not be going door to door in Baghdad in  the middle of a civil war with U.S. soldiers.  But it seems to me we should reasonably ask  the question:  If we have  trained 360,000 for security in Iraq, and  they can’t provide for their own security, where are they? We are now told  that up to 50 percent of those we have  trained are probably not on the  job  anymore. We don’t know where they  are.

2550,164,2007-10-31,Mrs. MCCASKILL.," Mr. President, if  the Senator would yield for a second,  as he well knows, I voted with him. I  voted with the Senator from Oklahoma  to try to pull some of the earmarks out  of the bill, to pull all of that money  out of children’s health  insurance. I  think he and I both agree on the goal.  The problem is, the question I wanted to ask—and he is not in a position to  answer it because, unfortunately, he is  not someone who was here who voted  for Medicare Part D, but the inconsistency as to what I hear from the White  House and what I think people in this  Chamber are hearing from the Senators  who voted  for Medicare Part D  is,  every argument  they are using  for  SCHIP is true but exponentially higher  in Medicare Part D.  By the way, the only difference is in  Medicare Part D the people who are  making the money are the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance  companies, and it is not funded and  multimillionaires and billionaires get  it. So it is so unfair to say that the  President is taking a principled stand  because if it were a principle, it would  have been consistent for both SCHIP  and Medicare Part D. That is the question that you are unable to answer, and  I have yet to hear anybody answer that  question.  ",2007
2551,164,2007-10-31,Mr. COBURN.," Mr. President, I reclaim my time to say the following: I  think  the  Senator  from Missouri  makes a good point on consistency. I  think they are  finally awakened to  what the American people want at the  White House. I think they are finally  starting to pay attention that being efficient in the Federal Government is  important.  But having not been, maybe, efficient  with Medicare Part D, I applaud the  President for now taking a stand on  something that is common sense that  would say: If we are going to have a  program for poor children, let’s make  sure  it  covers  poor  children. Let’s  make  sure  it  covers poor  children.  Right now it does not. Right now it  does not.  Rather than expand the program that  is not meeting what it is supposed to  do and raise taxes on the poorest of the  poor, I think the President’s response  and the CBO’s score, which is $7.8 billion more over the next 5 years instead  of $35 billion more over the next 5  years, is a reasonable response to really cover poor children.  And what we know, by what CBO  says, is that will do it. Now, let’s talk  about the difference in what we are  going to be having the cloture vote on  now versus the bill that the President  just vetoed. This bill covers 400,000 less  kids; it spends $500 million more. So we  are not at $4,000 anymore, we are at  about  $4,200  to buy  $2,300 worth of  health insurance. It does not fix the  fast lane for illegal immigrants as the  authors claim. It does not fix adults on  the SCHIP program.  CBO says in 2012, at least at a minimum, 10 percent of the enrollees will  still be adults.  It does not  fix  the  crowdout issue. This bill will cause 2  million people to lose private insurance coverage and come in a government-run program, crowding them out  of the private insurance market. Despite a fix for the problem of enrolling  more higher  income kids  than currently eligible kids in SCHIP, the CBO  still projects only 800,000 currently eligible, currently eligible SCHIP kids,  will get enrolled.  But 1.2 million kids of families making more than $60,000 will get enrolled.  So for every two kids we enroll who are  poor, we are going to take three kids  out of  the private  sector. We have  talked about what kids lose when they  go to the Medicaid Program.  What are the other problems? In this  bill are earmarks for specific hospitals  to violate CMS payment rules to pay  those hospitals more than what the  rules say because some Congressman or  Senator thinks they should not have to  live within the rules. I would love to be  able to tell that to people in a community in Oklahoma who just had to shut  down their hospital because they could  not make it under what CMS rules pay.  So what we have is about seven of  those in here, where we are going to  take care of  the  little hospitals of  seven Members of Congress, but we are  going to ignore all of the rest of the  community hospitals in this country  that are struggling under a payment  system that does not pay for the care  of people they are supposed to be caring for.  There  is still an  income disregard  loophole, which means it does not matter what you said because we have a  loophole that says if States want to,  they do not have to follow the income  guidelines. You can still enroll families  making more than $100,000 a year in  the SCHIP program.  Well, that is in there by design because the desire and design of this bill  is to move to single-payer, national  health care.  I think the Presiding Officer sitting  in the chair right now probably believes that is where we should go. I do  not have any problem debating that.  But the incrementalism and the real  effort of this bill is to expand SCHIP to  a point where Americans who have insurance are going to pay higher taxes  so everybody can get covered. If you  look at the mess that is trying to be  created by these five or six hospitals in  here right now, how are we going to  solve that problem when everything is  Medicare?  Some say we are going to take the  profit motive out of medicine. We are  going to take the profit motive out of  the drug  industry. We are going to  have a 220,000-physician shortage in 15  areas in this country. The applications  for enrollment at medical school are  diving. Why are they diving? Because  they cannot afford the education and  then have an income to pay off their  student loan, let alone pay for housing  and income to feed their kids.  How did that come about? It could  have been Medicare creating that. It  could have been that we were not willing to pay. What else is going to happen? Eighty percent of all innovation  in health care in the world comes from  this country. Eight out of every ten  new ideas that are lifesaving, eight out  of ten of every new treatments, eight  of ten new devices are developed in this  country.  Why are they developed? Because we  still have 48 percent of the health care  system that is not run by some government  program. And  through  there,  there is enough risk taken, based on  the reward that can be gained, to invest in capital and research to develop  these lifesaving treatments.  We say we want to move SCHIP in  the name of kids, but what we really  want to do is to have national health  care. Well, we better think about that  hard and long because here are the statistics on cancer  treatment  in  this  country compared to everywhere else  in the world. It does not matter what  cancer you get in this country, you  have a 50-percent greater chance of living 5 years than anywhere else in the  world.  Why is that? Is it those big, bad pharmaceutical  companies  that have  to  spend a billion dollars  just  to get  through the maze at FDA? Is that what  it is? Is that why? I am a two-time cancer survivor. I am so thankful for the  pharmaceutical industry. I would not  be here without them. Two times they  have developed, researched, and made  drugs that have saved my life.  I do not disagree that we have some  excesses in corporations in this country. But the pharmaceutical industry,  with all the negatives that are out  there, still leads one of the most positive responses we have ever seen in this  country to solving real problems for  real Americans. So we can beat them  up and we can beat the President up  and say Medicare Part D. I do regularly  on Medicare Part D. I don’t think we  ought to steal  from our children to  have drugs paid for. But this bill steals  from everybody. It also steals from the  poorest. It steals from the poor, blue-  collar, low-income worker who has the  benefit of a lot of other programs. It  says: We are going to raise your taxes  because you happen to be addicted to  nicotine. We are going to steal from  you to pay for somebody who is making $61,000 a year who already has insurance. Do we want to do that? Do we  want to steal from the people who are  working, barely getting by, so we can  pay for people who already have insurance? Is that what we are doing? That  is what we are doing.  I have listened to the debate. I offered some ways to change this. Senator BURRand I offered an amendment.  We didn’t get a vote on it. It solves  through tax credits a way to insure,  not go into a Medicaid program but insure with choice, so you take the stigma of Medicaid off patients’ foreheads.

Today and  in  the difficult days  to  come, we offer our sincerest condolences to the  family and  friends of  these seven young men and women.  The University  of  South  Carolina,  Clemson University, and the State of  South Carolina feel the immeasurable  pain of losing seven of our most precious sons and daughters, and as the  family South Carolinians are, we share  in your grief and offer our love and  support.  Not only do we mourn the loss of  sons and daughters, but we mourn the  loss of  future  leaders and  scholars,  peacemakers and trailblazers, parents  and friends.

I ask  others to find the courage and resolve  to  fulfill their suspended hopes and  dreams, ensuring  that  futures overcome  flames and aspirations prevail  over ashes.  Though it is grief that connects us  now, let it be the spirit of their lives  that forever bonds our community. We  should honor these students by taking  up the load they left for us to carry and  seeing  their  earthly  aspirations  through to their full fruition.  f  XV PAN AMERICAN GAMES  ",2007
2553,178,2007-10-31,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, it is with  great pride  that  I  join all of Connecticut in extending congratulations  to the many young athletes who competed in the 15th Pan American Games,  in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For over half  a century, these games have brought  together athletes from across the Western Hemisphere. This year 5,648 athletes from 49 countries came together  in Rio to compete in 38 sports.  The Pan American games, similar to  the Olympics, provide us another valuable opportunity to enjoy international  athletic  competition undertaken  for  pride and the love of the sport. By participating in the 15th Pan American  Games, these young Americans have  had an opportunity that few of their  fellow Americans ever will—to join in  competition with other young people  from North, Central, and South America.  I would like to commend the 14 athletes from Connecticut who competed  in  the  games:  John Ball, Andrew  Bolton,  Eliza  Cleveland,  Reilley  Dampeer,  Robert  Merrick,  Alyssa  Naeher, Todd Paul, Cara Raether, Geoffrey  Rathgeber,  Sarah  Trowbridge,  Karen Scavotto, Cameron Winklevoss,  Tyler Winklevoss, Bartosz Wolski. It is  with great pleasure and pride that I  offer  further congratulations  to  the  Connecticut  athletes  who  brought  home three gold and five silver medals  and  one  bronze medal. Without  a  doubt, the nine medals won by Connecticut’s  athletes  contributed  to  America’s overall victory at the 15th  Pan American Games. It is my hope  that these kinds of events will further  unite our hemisphere.  f  ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS  CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL  OF THE WAILUKU COURTHOUSE  ∑",2007

2555,185,2007-10-31,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President,  I  rise to introduce legislation to ban the  use of phthalates in toys.  This legislation will ban the use of  six types of phthalates in toys, which  are linked to birth defects. Phthalates  are plasticizing chemicals used in a variety of everyday products, including  cosmetics, nail polish, paint, and shower curtains. Alarmingly, they are used  in a variety of children’s toys, such as  rubber ducks, teething rings, and bath  toys.  This legislation will ban the manufacture, sale or distributions of toys  and  childcare  articles  that  contain  more than .1 percent of DEHP, DBP, or  BBP.  It will also ban  the manufacture,  sale,  or  distribution  of  toys  and  childcare articles for use by children 3  years old or younger that contain more  than  .1 percent of DINP, DIDP, or  DnOP.  It clearly states that phthalates cannot be replaced with other dangerous  chemicals  identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as carcinogens, possible carcinogens, or chemicals that cause reproductive or developmental harm.  Phthalates are used in a variety of  PVC, polyvinyl chloride, plastic products to make them soft and pliable.  Phthalates are not chemically bonded  to PVC molecules. When a child places  a plastic toy with phthalates into his  or her mouth, these phthalates leach  out of the plastic product and into the  child’s system.  Phthalates are found in many common children’s toys: rubber ducks, soft  bath books, teethers, and even dolls. In  2006, the San Francisco Chronicle sent  16 common children’s toys to a Chicago  lab for testing to see if they exceeded  the  .1 percent limit proposed in this  legislation. The results should alarm  parents everywhere. One teether contained a phthalate at five times the  proposed limit. A rubber duck sold at  Walgreens had 13 times the proposed  limit of DEHP, a carcinogenic phthalate. The face of a popular doll contained double the proposed phthalate  limit.  While the science is still evolving, we  know that exposure to phthalates can  cause serious long-term health effects.  Phthalates interfere with the natural  functioning of  the hormone  system,  and can cause reproductive abnormalities, many resulting from low levels of  testosterone.  In 2005, Dr. Shanna Swan of the University of Rochester School of Medicine found that pregnant women with  high levels of phthalates in their urine  were more likely to give birth to boys  with a birth defect that is a key indicator of low testosterone levels.  Men with high phthalate levels have  lower sperm counts and damaged sperm  DNA.  Phthalate  exposure has also been  linked  to premature birth and  the  early onset of puberty. They may be a  factor in some cancers.  Young  children, whose bodies are  still growing and developing, are particularly vulnerable when exposed to  phthalates in the toys around them.  In the face of this troubling science,  at least 14 other nations have acted to  ban or restrict the use of phthalates in  children’s products. Examples include:  the European Union’s ban, upon which  this legislation is modeled, has been in  effect since 2006; the Argentina Ministry of Health imposed a ban in 1999;  and  Japan  banned  toys  containing  DEHP and DINP intended to be put in  the mouth of children up to the age of  6.  My home State of California recently  became  the  first  state  to  ban  phthalates in toys and other products  intended for children. California parents will now know that the toys they  give  their  children are not placing  them at risk for serious health problems.  It is time for the rest of the country  to follow the lead of California, the European Union, and other nations. Without action, the U.S. risks becoming a  dumping ground  for phthalate  laden  toys that cannot legally be sold elsewhere. American children deserve better.  Opponents of this ban will argue that  we cannot safely replace phthalates,  and  that  these  replacements  could  place children at an even greater risk.  The experience in the European Union  certainly suggests otherwise.  Facing the phthalate ban, European  manufacturers began to develop alternatives. Danisco, a Danish company,  has introduced a phthalate alternative  that has been approved for use in both  the U.S. and the European Union.  Manufacturers have  found ways to  make safe, phthalate free toys for European Union children, and there is no  reason that they should not do the  same for American children.  There is much we do not know about  the chemicals that surround us. Evidence is demonstrating that phthalates  are posing a risk to children. I strongly  believe that products not known to be  safe should not be in the hands and  mouths of children.  I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and to provide all American children with the same safe toys  available in Europe and California.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the text of  the bill was ordered to be printed in  the RECORD, as follows:  S. 2275  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

2556,206,2007-10-31,Mr. RANGEL.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  in remembrance of a  true patriot and committed public servant, the late Joseph Crapa.  He boasted a litany of high posts and honors  to his name, but it was as Chief of Staff to  that he so ably  served my native New York. Staffers like Mr.  Crapa are  the backbone of Capitol Hill,  the  too-often unsung movers and shakers who  work feverishly on behalf of the American people.  Known as a fast-talking guy from Brooklyn,  Mr. Crapa’s magnetism drew a series of glowing  compliments—solid, wise,  shrewd. He  loved politics and government, but remained  loyal to his unwavering moral core. He was an  intellectual powerhouse, relentless in his defense of the little guy, but with the practical  political know-how to get things done. As the  executive director of the U.S. Commission on  International Religious Freedom, his last post,  he agitated for a cause near and dear to his  heart: the battle for religious freedom worldwide.  He is today—and always—remembered and  appreciated as a man of conviction and a  wealth of knowledge.  ‘‘SALT-OF-THE-EARTH’’ STAFFERCRAPA  MOURNEDONHILL  Joseph Crapa, the executive director of the  U.S. Commission on International Religious  Freedom, died Thursday from cancer at the  age of 63.  Crapa, who had led the commission since  2002, previously worked for 25 years in various  Capitol Hill-related  jobs,  including  House committee offices, Member offices and  in the Congressional relations shops of several executive branch agencies.  Immediately before coming to the commission, Crapa worked as chief of staff to Sen.  Charles Schumer (D–N.Y.).  ‘‘Joe was a pure salt-of-the-earth human  being,’’ Schumer wrote in an e-mail.  ‘‘To  know him was to love him.’’  Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton  (D–N.Y.)  noted in a statement that she knew Crapa  during his service in the Senate and the Clinton administration. She lauded Crapa’s ‘‘indomitable spirit and determination’’ during  the fight to secure funding for New York in  the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist  attacks.  Crapa also served as counsel and staff director in the office of Rep. David Obey (D–  Wis.) for 10 years, before leaving in 1997 to  become associate administrator for congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the  Environmental Protection Agency.  Obey said he was dubious when he first  interviewed Crapa for a job in 1987.  ‘‘I thought, ‘There’s no way in God’s green  earth I can work with this fast-talking guy  from Brooklyn,’’ Obey said. ‘‘He was about  three times as intense as I was. But his solidity, wisdom, and shrewdness came through,  and we ended up not only working together  for 10 years, but becoming close friends.’’  Obey said Crapa was a ‘‘superb example’’ of  the importance of the role staffers play on  the Hill.  ‘‘There are a lot of people who never serve  in elected office—staffers and people in various agencies—who  love this country, are  dedicated to doing things right and to advancing the cause of regular people,’’ Obey  said. He said Crapa ‘‘loved politics, he loved  government, he had a moral core to everything he did. He was an intellectual and, at  the same time, a hard-nosed practicing pol in  the best sense of the word.’’  In a statement released by USCIRF on  Thursday, Chairman Michael Cromartie said  Crapa ‘‘had an unwavering, principled commitment to . . . protecting religious freedom  worldwide.’’ He and Vice Chairwoman Preeta  Bansal both commented on Crapa’s ‘‘sharp  political instincts,’’ which Barisal said were  ‘‘crucial to him in this sensitive area.’’  Over  the  course  of  his  career, Crapa  worked as the top congressional relations official at the EPA, the Department of Agriculture  and  the U.S. Agency  for  International Development, and in the No. 2 spot  in the Department of Commerce’s congressional relations office.  He also spent time at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, where he  was the executive director of the Speaker’s  Club, and as vice president at lobby shop  Dutko and Associates. For 6 years during his  time in Obey’s office and at the EPA, Crapa  taught part-time as adjunct professor of government at Georgetown University. He was a  John C. Stennis Congressional fellow in 1995–  1996.  Crapa was born Dec. 16, 1943, in Brooklyn,  N.Y. He received his bachelor’s degree from  St. John’s University in New York City and  went on to receive a master’s degree from  Duke and a Ph.D. from the University of Arizona; all three degrees were in British and  American  literature. He married Barbara  Vaskis in 1967; the couple had one son, Judd,  and two grandsons, Sebastian and Baird.  A memorial service for Crapa is scheduled  for 1 p.m. today at St. Peter’s Church on  Capitol Hill.  JAMES P. CHEEVER 100TH  BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE  HON. KENDRICK B.

2557,206,2007-10-31,Mr. MEEK of Florida.," Madam Speaker, I rise  to honor and congratulate James P. Cheever,  who will be celebrating his 100th birthday on  Sunday, November 4, 2007, at Tony Reception Palace, in Hialeah, FL. Many of his family,  friends, and church friends will be in attendance  to celebrate  this momentous occasion.  He was born on November 7, 1907, in Sylvania, Georgia. He is the middle child of six  siblings, with  one  remaining  sister, Ruby  Cheever.  He was educated  in  the Sylvania school  system. At the age of 22, he met and married  Edna Mae Striggles. They were married on  December 22, 1929. They shared 58 years of  marriage until her death in 1987. Their union  was blessed with  four children, James P.  Cheever, Jr., Henry Richmond Cheever, and  Margie Beatrice Mayes. Their daughter Fronita  Cheever, died at a very young age.  He has 10 grandchildren, Gregory Cheever,  Gail Washington, Glenda Jimeson, Anthony  Cheever, Aundrea Mayes, Carey Cheever,  LaEatrice McMurray, Laketia Cheever, Vincent  Cheever and Tonya Linde. He has 25 great-  grandchildren and 7 great-great grandchildren.  As many others did during the early 1900s,  he earned a living by farming land in Georgia.  Although farming provided a modest living, he  and his wife wanted a better quality of life for  their family. In November of 1947, he moved  his family to Miami, Florida.  After arriving in Miami, he worked several  odd jobs to support his family and he started  working for a major construction firm, Benidick  and Jordan Construction Company,  in 1950.  He was the only African-American man hired  at that time to tie steel for the company and  became the top man for the construction company.  In 1962, he left the construction field to work  for  the Dade County Public School system.  During his employment with DCPS, he worked  as Lead Custodian at Brownsville Junior High  School and Carol City Elementary. He retired  from DCPS in June of 1973. After retirement,  he launched his own Lawn Service and was  known by many for the meticulous lawn care  he provided his customers.  James is a God-fearing man who dedicated  is life to the Lord at a very young age. While  living in Georgia he was a member of Lawton  Grove Missionary Baptist Church. When he relocated to Miami, he moved his membership  to New Hope Missionary Baptist Church  in  Liberty City, where he became a deacon on  January 14, 1954, under  the  leadership of  Rev. James E. Brown.  Several years later he moved his membership to become a founding member of Greater  New Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church, located  in Brownsville, under Pastor Rosco  Jackson. He still attends services  regularly  and currently serves as the oldest deacon on  the deacon board, under  the  leadership of  Rev. Sherman Mungin.  James and his wife bought their first home  in Florida, in what was known as Brownsville,  in 1956. The property was acquired by  the  County, to build a public park, in 1969.

Imagine  for  a moment  30,000-pound  bombs dropped on nuclear research labs  in Natanz and  in Bushehr, and you  have a humanitarian and ecological  disaster on your hands.  Now, the case for war against Iran is  being built on lies, just as the case for  war against  Iraq was built on  lies.  Nearly 4,000 troops dead; nearly a million  innocent  Iraqis perished  in the  conflict; borrowing money from China  to fight a war against Baghdad.  It is time to impeach this Vice President for leading this country into a  war that is so destructive of our national agenda.

2563,8,2007-11-08,Mr. CONYERS.," Madam Speaker,  today,  I  rise against H.R. 3688, the United States-Peru  Trade Promotion Agreement  Implementation  Act. Southeast Michigan has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs due to unfair free  trade  agreements  such  as  NAFTA  and  CAFTA. Unfortunately, H.R. 3688  follows  in  the steps of these lopsided trade deals.  Advocates of  today’s  legislation will  insist  that there are strong labor and environmental  standards. However, members of the Peruvian  Congress were working to pass a robust General Labor Law and now it will be tabled for a  substantially weaker labor law issued by President Garc´ia. Furthermore,  given President  Bush’s track record on lack of enforcement of  current U.S. law, I cannot be persuaded that  many of the labor provisions will be enforced.  Unbalanced trade has led to a race to the bottom which has lowered job quality and wages  for U.S. workers and H.R. 3688 will further encourage this push for cheap labor.  This bill  is also bad  for Peruvians. More  than  three million Peruvians may  lose  their  jobs from U.S. exports and may drive many  rural farmers into the illegal cocoa trade. H.R.  3688 will limit Peruvian access to health care.  Specifically,  by  approving  this  free  trade  agreement, drug companies will obtain  five  years of data exclusivity, or monopoly rights  for  pharmaceutical manufacturers  in  both  countries, which will  increase  the price of  medicine, delay the entry of new drugs, and  restrict competition in this market. As a result,  millions of Peruvians will be at risk of losing  life saving drugs. Furthermore, if Peru chooses to replace its current private Social Security  system with its previous public system, then  this bill may open the door to allow private foreign investors to file suit at international tribunals.  Madam Speaker, a recent poll indicated that  the majority of Americans oppose the concept  of free trade. It is no surprise that dozens of  labor, environment, human  rights, and  religious organizations have opposed this bill because it is bad for both the United States and  Peru. I urge my colleagues to vote against this  bill.  ",2007
2564,8,2007-11-08,Mr. PATRICK J.," MURPHY of Pennsylvania.  Madam Speaker,  I rise  in opposition  to  the  U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement.  I oppose  this bill because  I come  from a  part of our country that has seen all the drawbacks of  free  trade without any of  the supposed benefits. I oppose this bill on behalf of  the countless Americans who spent years of  their lives working in a steel mill or manufacturing plant whose lives were uprooted in the  wake of NAFTA and CAFTA.  I represent the 8th District of Pennsylvania.  My State has been one of the hardest hit by  free  trade agreements and  the unfair  trade  practices of nations, such as China, that don’t  play by the rules. Bucks County was hit hard.  Manufacturing jobs used to number in the tens  of  thousands, but by 2005,  they had  fallen  nearly 35 percent. This devastation  included  major employers like US Steel, Jones Apparel,  and Rohm and Haas—companies  that now  employ a fraction of what they once did. Each  one of those lost jobs represents a worker and  his or her family whose lives were turned upside down by so called ‘‘free trade.’’ Madam  Speaker, free trade is not free if it costs American workers their jobs.  I believe that when everyone plays by the  rules, American workers will beat out foreign  competition  every  time. Unfortunately,  not  every nation plays by  the  rules and even  worse, the Bush administration has done nothing  to protect American workers  from unfair  competition.  In  fact,  the President has gone  out of his way to sign free trade agreements,  like CAFTA, that harm American working men  and women.  Madam Speaker, it is for that reason that I  must oppose  this bill. While  this agreement  paid heed to labor, health and environmental  concerns for the first time in years, we need  to back up words with action. Supporters of  this bill are saying all of the right things and  I am glad that these concerns were taken into  account. However, when  the  livelihoods of  American families are at stake, words simply  aren’t good enough. We need concrete action  and this bill offers us no guarantees.  We are debating this bill under ‘‘fast-track’’  rules. That means that the Congress gets no  say in the details of the agreement and that  we simply must  trust  that  the President  is  going to do right by American workers. This  President has broken his word over and over  again  throughout his  time  in office and we  cannot  trust him again. We have seen  the  Bush administration repeatedly putting the interests of the few ahead of the needs of the  many.  For example, if we had the ability to amend  this trade agreement, I would fight to include  the provisions of a bill I have introduced that  would  require national  security  reviews of  trade deals before we agree to them. My bill,  The Trade-Related American National Security  Enhancement and Accountability, TRANSEA,  Act also would allow for the suspension of existing trade agreements if the safety, health,  and welfare of Americans are in doubt. I think  these provisions would have made a vast improvement to the Peru Free Trade Agreement,  but unfortunately because of fast track rules,  we are prohibited  from even  trying  to offer  changes to make the bill better for American  workers.  Madam Speaker, I am not an anti-trade crusader. Certainly, if trade is done the right way,  with attention paid to labor, environmental and  health standards,  then  it can benefit everybody from workers to business owners, both in  the United States and other parts of the world.  Unfortunately, with President Bush’s disastrous record, we cannot trust him, to enforce  the agreement  in a way  that will be  fair  to  American working men and women. It is for  these reasons, Madam Speaker, that I oppose  this trade agreement.  ",2007
2565,8,2007-11-08,Mr. MCDERMOTT.," Madam Speaker,  it  is  time that America work for America’s workers,  farmers and  families. The Peru Free Trade  Agreement is a step in the right direction. It  marks the first time in history that a FTA has  incorporated  labor and environmental provisions.  This is a major step forward because it signals that the pursuit of trade is not an end, but  a means  to help raise  living standards and  provide opportunity.  I  represent a  trade dependent city and yet my constituents are leery  of FTAs because  they  fear  that American  workers have been left behind.  Today, we are at a crossroads. We can  continue down the path we have been on and  keep pursing  freer  trade knowing  that many  Americans are falling through a domestic safety net built 70 years ago, or we can pursue  policies that respond to a new century.  Last week the House made a good start by  adopting legislation to reform the Unemployment  Insurance  program  and  update  the  Trade Adjustment Assistance program. We  must do more. Health care that is tied to employment is insecure.  Education benefits  that aren’t available  to  working adults do not meet the needs of the  modern workforce. Our  trade  agreements  need to be smarter, too. We know that supporting core worker rights—human rights—is  central  to enabling workers  to benefit  fully  from their labor.  We know that the tools of public policy need  flexibility to ensure access in areas like affordable prescription drugs. We know  that  the  Earth’s environment  isn’t yours or mine,  it’s  ours.  Chief Si’ahl,  the  inspired  leader  of  the  Duwamish and Suquamish Tribes, for whom  my City of Seattle is named, said it best.  A century ago, this great tribal chief said:  ‘‘We did not weave the web of life. We are  merely a strand in it. Whatever we do to the  web, we do to ourselves.’’  My support for the Peru Free Trade Agreement is for this particular FTA, in part because  of  the  progress we’ve  achieved  in  incorporating  labor and environmental standards,  and health concerns.  I will continue to consider each FTA on its  merits, and in its own context.  I will be paying close attention to the Administration and  its commitment  to Americans  through TAA and healthcare for the children of  working families.

Mr. Speaker, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, our Armed  Forces have  been  deployed  in  two  major theaters of operation. Too many  of  our  noble  servicemembers  have  given what Abraham Lincoln called the  last full measure of devotion to the Nation. Many more of these brave men  and women bear the physical and mental scars of battle which will last their  lifetimes.  As a Congress, we must continue to  work to ensure that our military has  all the equipment and training necessary to successfully and safely complete their missions.  I commend the members of the conference committee for working in a bipartisan manner to meet the needs of  our military and veterans in the conference report on the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008. The  $459 billion in the bill will provide the  necessary  resources  to  our Armed  Forces and continue the investments  that we have made to make certain  that the American military is the finest in the world.  The conference report provides $23.5  billion, over $2.2 billion above the fiscal 2007 level, for Defense health programs. The bill improves the Pentagon’s electronic medical records and  enables better  coordination between  DOD and the VA. It also enhances preventative medicine programs and increases  investments  in medical  research. I’d like to highlight that $138  million has been allocated for breast  cancer  research and  $80 million  for  prostate cancer research.  To support our soldiers’ families, the  bill provides $2.6 billion for family advocacy and other programs to support  families affected by the rigors of war.  The conference report also gives all  of our military personnel a much deserved pay raise, as was mentioned by  the distinguished chairman,  3.5 percent, and fully funds the efforts to increase our Armed Forces,  including  equipping and training costs for 7,000  new members of the Army and 5,000  new marines.  The bill also protects our soldiers in  combat by providing $11.6 billion for  Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles and increases funding for body  armor and other protective equipment.  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the majority has yet to send the President  any appropriations bill this year to  sign into law. This is the longest Congress has taken to finish even one appropriation bill in over 20 years. Because the majority has failed to complete its work on these important appropriations bills, funding for the Federal Government is set to expire on November 16. This conference report will  extend the current continuing resolution through December 14 so that the  government can continue  to  remain  open.  The CR, the continuing resolution,  also provides $6.4 billion in emergency  spending,  including  $2.9  billion  for  FEMA’s disaster relief fund, $500 million for fighting wildfires, and $3 billion for the gulf coast Road Home hurricane rebuilding program. It also increases funding to prepare for the 2010  census, as well as another $2.9 billion  to bring VA funding up to the President’s fiscal year 2008 request.

2581,43,2007-11-08,Mr. KLEIN of Florida.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would also like to  acknowledge Chairman BARNEYFRANK,  who, without his guidance and leadership and thoughtfulness and process of  good ideas, we wouldn’t be here today,  as well  as Tom Glassic, Kathleen  Mellody,  Lawranne  Stewart,  Peter  Roberson, Patrick Givens  from Congressman MAHONEY’s office, and Garrett Donovan from my office, and all  the staff and experts from around the  country who have participated in this  very carefully thought out piece of innovative legislation.  We are very honored  to be here  today, because the bill that we have before us is a comprehensive step in the  right direction. As a Member of Congress from south Florida, I have lived  under the threat of natural disasters  for some time. It was only when I came  to Washington, however, that I began  to discuss  this  issue with Members  from other parts of country who also  shared  stories  about  disasters  that  their constituents faced, earthquakes,  hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes. It was  then that I began to realize that this is  not a regional problem; it is a national  one.  I further reflected on the fact that  the Federal response following a major  disaster is very predictable. We open up  the Treasury and start spending. This  spending  is  entirely necessary,  but  often  is delivered with only  few restraints and comes equally from taxpayers in every corner of our country.  So even if you are not in a high-risk region, you are still  impacted by the  event.  Under this bill, participating States  would  be  better  protected,  again,  States that only opt in on their own if  they choose; and they would be  increasingly able to provide services for  those who are not able to find insurance on their own. The State-Federal  partnership would present States with  the tools necessary to responsibly, fiscally responsibly, manage their risk  before disaster strikes, while also ensuring that States can quickly and efficiently respond to homeowners’ insurance claims following a natural catastrophe.  b1600  This legislation employs several new  ideas to help States address the property insurance crisis, such as the transfer of States’ insurance risk through  the use of catastrophe bonds. By utilizing an innovative capital market approach, the bill allows investors to assume some of the risk, while at the  same time putting the burden on local  homeowners to do all the necessary  mitigation responsibility they have to  reduce risk to their own home, to the  State, and to the Federal Government.  This is a fundamental rethinking of  disaster planning and response, and it  is long overdue. Our bill works because  it’s voluntary, actuarially sound, and  stabilizes the market by ensuring that  homeowners will  always  get  their  claim paid while capping the State liability.  In addition, our bill is fiscally responsible. The Homeowners’ Defense  Act will end the policy of Federal bailouts following natural disasters.  The steps taken in this bill provide  us with a blueprint of how States can  responsibly plan for catastrophes ahead  while also providing them with a path  to recovery.  As I have said time and time again,  the status quo is no longer an option. I  urge Members of this body to vote  ‘‘yes’’ on this bill.  ",2007
2582,43,2007-11-08,Ms. CORRINE BROWN  of Florida.," Mr.  Chairman, as a Member from Florida, I rise in  strong support of  the Homeowners’ Defense  Act, H.R. 3355.  The terribly high cost for homeowners paying property insurance in my State of Florida,  as well as for those on the Gulf Coast, and as  we saw  just recently,  in California, has become a growing concern for homeowners. We  saw what happened after hurricane Katrina  and Rita and the four hurricanes that hit my  district in Florida back in 2004.  These hurricanes, and other recent natural  disasters, have led the insurance companies  to  limit  their exposure  to such disasters by  outright pulling out, or reducing their risk. And  this back peddling on their obligations on the  part of the insurance industry has resulted in  homeowner insurance rates rising by 100 percent to over 600 percent in higher-risk areas.  This is entirely unacceptable. How can homeowners possibly afford this? This is just outrageous. We need to take action and step in.  Just last week we saw the insurance companies out in California saying they will not provide  insurance  to hundreds of  thousands of  people  that  lost  their homes  in  the  terrible  wildfires that hit the coast, all the way from LA  to the Mexican border.  This is why people buy insurance: to protect  themselves. How is it then that after disaster  after disaster can we just sit back and allow  these companies to pull out of the market.  Rising insurance rates are affecting homeowners across the country, not just in Florida.  Clearly, the insurance market is not working,  and it is time to put through a plan to stabilize  the market and lower insurance rates for consumers.  ",2007
2583,43,2007-11-08,Mr. BACHUS.," Mr. Chairman, many of us  are  sympathetic  to  the  insurance  rate  increases coastal catastrophe-prone areas have  experienced  recently, but  there  is no consensus that H.R. 3355 would offer any long-  term help. Instead of granting long-term relief  for middle-income coastal homeowners confronted with  rising  insurance costs,  this bill  would stick taxpayers wiith the tab of bailing  out  insolvent State  insurance companies.  In  the past few years since some of the largest  hurricanes on  record  tore  through  the gulf  coast and  coastal Florida, affected States  have  tried  to protect  their  local markets,  to  limit  rates  increases,  force coverage, or  restrict market freedom.

2584,50,2007-11-08,Mr. ROSKAM.," Finally, on the basis  of time, and I will be happy to continue  the  conversation with you and  the  chairman,  in my view,  I  think  the  grace period for States is too long for  their mitigation  efforts. For  those  States currently with a program  in  place, the manager’s amendment says  all of these mitigation components are  excellent, but we are going to give you  5 years to get your act together.  My suggestion would be let’s shorten  that up. Let’s make it 2 years, and I  think that is still very gracious, to follow on the word of grace. But 5 years is  almost the length of the entire program that is being proposed. That is a  suggestion  regarding  a way  that  I  think the bill can be improve.  I yield to the gentleman.  ",2007
2585,50,2007-11-08,Mr. KLEIN of Florida.," I am a true believer, if you give somebody 5 years to  do it, it will take 5 years. At the same  time I realize from the experience we  have had in Florida and many other  States that have tried to move forward  with building codes and other things, it  does take some time. But I am all for  encouraging as strong as possible to  move as quickly as possible.  ",2007

Today I offer an amendment essential  to  stopping  this Congress  from  running down a  road  that  I’ve expressed caution about earlier today,  and that is causing further government  involvement  in  self-sufficient, available, and reliable private markets.  Congress  recently  passed  the National Flood  Insurance Reform; and  while I didn’t agree with the wind provision  inclusion,  it made  crucial  strides in reducing damage from flooding and storms, especially in areas suffering  repeat events. However, H.R.  3355  does  not  specifically  prescribe  mitigation guidelines.  In title  II,  it  merely alludes to Treasury providing a  general directive; and,  in my view,  that’s not good enough.  Currently, H.R. 3355 only requires the  reinsurance fund receiving the loan to  provide coverage for properties that adhere to applicable State building codes,  leaving open the possibility that States  with substandard codes, or even lacking codes, can still access the loans.  Instead, Treasury should be required  to certify that the State has implemented best practices building codes  for  the applicable exposures,  taking  into account the State’s geography, catastrophe risk and building patterns,  which  is what my amendment does  here today.  This would not be a national building  code, but rather, a regionally specific  criteria for program participation.  The language in my amendment also  gives broad flexibility to the Treasury  to certify whether State building codes  are appropriate for the types of risks  they face. It doesn’t apply specific, bureaucratic and unreachable one-size-  fits-all standards for the Treasury to  abide by.  The  language  is necessary because  the current language in the bill would  create  an  implicit  guarantee  that  would result in an inequitable Federal  subsidy  for  certain State  insurance  programs and policyholders, thus creating no need for local municipalities  and developers to stop development in  risk-prone areas. This was made very  clear during the testimony that we  heard  in the hearings several weeks  ago.  The  further  subsidization of  rates  would undermine economic incentives  to mitigate risks.  Individuals  facing  subsidized rates would be encouraged  to take on risks that are inappropriate,  specifically  putting  themselves  in  harm’s way because they don’t bear the  full weight of the potential damages.  Now, I represent citizens from Illinois, and we would never choose to participate in this program. And let me  tell you, the view from Lombard, Illinois, is very different from Key West,  and God bless the folks that live in Key  West, but I don’t think that the residents I represent should be in a position to subsidize someone else’s view.  Why should Illinois bail out States  that can’t address their own problems?  While I’m sensitive and I admire my  colleagues from Florida, I do believe  that some of this is simply an exacerbation of government programs that  have completely  failed. Many other  States have taken into account and addressed market issues based on increasing private market participation.  South Carolina  introduced  policyholder or catastrophe savings accounts  to assist consumers and address cost  issues. Louisiana and South Carolina  addressed rating and regulatory matters by encouraging greater competition among insurers rather than rate  controls that discourage private market competition. Louisiana has committed financial incentives for insurers  to underwrite or take policies from the  residual market and write-in coastal  areas. Several States have also  improved building codes and their enforcement as part of the long-term solution to catastrophic risk.  Floods are the majority of disasters  that my congressional district faces,  and we haven’t sat by and waited for  the government to help. The State of  Illinois has one of the strongest floodplain management programs  in  the  country.  Illinois  leads  all Midwest  States for the number of NFIP-participating communities,  flood  insurance  policies, and flood insurance claims. Illinois outpaces  the other States  in  local floodplain assistance, mitigation  activities, and flood control projects.  Specifically, two cities  in my district, Des Plaines and Mt. Prospect,  were badly hurt by floods in August of  this year. But they didn’t suffer as  much as they could have, because they  are moving  forward on major  flood  mitigation efforts by building levees on  the Des Plaines River. This project will  move hundreds of homes and businesses  out of the floodplain, thus reducing the  amount of damage during flood season  and lowering insurance rates for homeowners.  There’s been an unprecedented population growth and significant development  in  coastal  and  disaster-prone  areas in recent decades, and total property exposures have increased dramatically.

2592,57,2007-11-08,Mr. MANZULLO.," I think the gentleman and I agree on the fact that the  loan should be repaid and not be a  grant, but  I think we disagree  fundamentally on how it would be administered. That’s why this amendment is  a backup amendment to make sure  that the loans are repaid.  ",2007

The only thing I’m suggesting, as we  pull up this language, is that it’s already in the bill. The intention is that  the Treasury have this authority. If it  isn’t clear, we would be glad to fix it.  But I think it is crystal clear and we’ll  just pull it up.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of  the gentlewoman from West Virginia  has expired.

2601,57,2007-11-08,Mr. MATHESON.," Mr. Chairman,  offer an amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk  will designate the amendment.  I  The text of the amendment is as follows:  Amendment No. 4 offered by Mr. MATHESON:  Page 8, line 24, before the period insert the  following: ‘‘, and the first such annual report  shall include an assessment of the costs to  States and regions associated with catastrophe risk and an analysis of the costs and  benefits, for States not participating in the  Consortium, of such nonparticipation.’’  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5  minutes.  ",2007
2602,57,2007-11-08,Mr. MATHESON.," Mr. Chairman I rise  today, first of all, in strong support of  H.R.  3355,  the Homeowners’ Defense  Act, and I offer an amendment that I  believe will further support the intent  of this legislation, namely to better enable State-sponsored reinsurance programs to protect themselves by transferring catastrophic risk into capital  markets.  I should first commend Congressman  KLEIN and Congressman MAHONEY for  their proactive approach in this legislation, which allows States to responsibly plan for disasters ahead of time  by pooling risk. By accessing capital  markets to transfer risk, State-sponsored  insurance  funds will be better  protected in the event of future disaster and will be increasingly able to  provide affordable services for homeowners.  This legislation will provide an important backstop for many of the larger State-sponsored insurance plans but  will also provide States like my home  State of Utah with an opportunity to  prepare  for  future catastrophes. The  State of Utah does not currently have  a State-sponsored catastrophic insurance plan but is considering developing  one.  Utah has been ranked as one of the  top ten U.S. earthquake States in the  United States, and in some areas of the  State, catastrophe risks also include  wildfires, flooding, and mudslides. Of  course many of these risks are unique  to Utah, but many of  these  risks,  things like fault lines or forest ranges,  are spread over many States. I believe  that States should be assessing many  of these risks on a regional basis given  the nature of those risks.  Very  simply, Mr.  Chairman, my  amendment would  require  that  the  first annual report of the consortium  that’s established by this  legislation  should  include an assessment of the  costs associated with catastrophic risk  for States and regions and an analysis  of the costs and benefits of participation in the program for States that are  not part of the consortium.  It  is my hope  that  in providing  States with an assessment of the catastrophic risks posed to their respective  State and region and the costs associated with trying to address those risks,  those States could evaluate and consider developing a State-sponsored catastrophic insurance plan if they do not  already have one. I believe this legislation provides an important mechanism  for States to protect themselves in the  event of catastrophe, and I urge support of this amendment so that States  can make a more  informed decision  going forward.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",2007
2603,57,2007-11-08,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman from West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.  ",2007
2604,57,2007-11-08,Mrs. CAPITO.," Mr. Chairman, I have  no  opposition  to Mr. MATHESON’s  amendment.  I just want to go back to the last  point we were taking about with Mr.  MANZULLO, the gentleman  from  Illinois. His amendment was putting forth  the fact that if there is a loan to the  State under these provisions that  if  they were in default or were not repaying their loan that there shouldn’t be  any further loans.  b1715  And the gentleman offered me a clarification by reading me some text.  On further looking at the text, yes,  the text does say that the Secretary of  the Treasury requires full payment of  the loan; but it also says that the Secretary can then determine that if full  repayment is not made or is unlikely  to be made, that the only punishment  or the only enforcement mechanism is  the Secretary will then submit a report  to the Congress explaining why repayment is not being made. It does not  state in here, at least to my mind in  the way  I read  it, that that State  would be precluded from being able to  attain another or further loan under  the provisions of this bill.  I appreciate the opportunity to make  that clarification. I think it strengthens Mr. MANZULLO’s amendment, which  I fully support. And, again, I thank the  gentleman for his indulgence.  ",2007

2606,57,2007-11-08,Mr. KLEIN of Florida.,"  I want  to  thank the gentleman from Utah for an  excellent amendment which really adds  some good value to the bill. And basically what it does is it creates a metric  by which States can determine whether  joining the consortium in the future  would provide a benefit. It’s information. The more information the States  have, the better, the more consumers  will benefit. I think that’s the kind of  ongoing accountability, both  to  the  taxpayers and  to  the States  themselves,  in  terms of whether  this  is  something  that  a  particular  State  should join.  So I appreciate the suggestion. We  didn’t think of it. It’s another good example of us all coming together and  trying to put something together that  makes some sense. So I would like to  support the amendment, and I thank  the gentleman.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN.

2615,92,2007-11-08,Ms. FOXX.," Mr. Speaker, this coming  week we will celebrate Veterans Day.  As we remember the many who have  given their lives in service to our Nation, I hope we pause not only to honor  their memory, but also to express our  gratitude  for  that which  their  sacrifices have secured.  The many American veterans that we  honor today are a reflection of American greatness. The men and women of  our Armed Forces throughout our Nation’s history have not hesitated to  make tremendous personal sacrifices  for the cause of freedom. If it were not  for our brave and selfless veterans, we  would be a land of fewer freedoms and  smaller liberties.  Throughout our history, our veterans  have gone to foreign shores to fight the  forces of injustice and tyranny. Today,  many live in freedom thanks to their  great sacrifices.  Our veterans are the first and the finest  example of  the American hero.  They have preserved our peace and  they have held back the tide of darkness when the call has sounded to protect our liberty. And these men and  women have done and continue to do  these things with a sense of duty that  has never shirked the great sacrifices,  but instead, upholds the mantle of democracy with strength and pride.  On Veterans Day, we rightly single  out the members of our Armed Forces,  past and present, and give them the  honor that they do not ask for, but  that they so richly deserve.  I do not say this lightly, that our  veterans are the primary forces that  keep and have kept the vision of America  alive  throughout  the  centuries.  Ours is a vision of freedom for all, a vision of a land where any man or woman  can breathe free and lay hold of prosperity, secure in the knowledge that  their brave and selfless soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and coast guardsmen have proven that our cause is worthy of the most profound of sacrifices.  We must not take our freedoms lightly. They have been purchased with the  blood and sacrifice of many patriots.  These patriots have answered the call  to service, knowing that a life without  liberty is hardly worth living.  They’ve shown us that our freedoms  are invaluable and priceless beyond the  paltry dividends of a  life under the  shadow of tyranny or fear or repression.  We have much to be grateful for in  this Nation. Our freedoms are many  and our sacrifices are few in comparison to what our veterans willingly give  up. And these sacrifices are made on  our behalf so that we might enjoy a liberty  that  is  unrivaled  throughout  human history.  It is therefore a tremendous pleasure  to honor the men and women who saw  the value of freedom and grasped the  threat of tyranny and did not shrink  into the twilight. As Thomas Paine  said of our freedom on the eve of the  American Revolution: ‘‘The sun never  shined on a cause of greater worth.’’  I thank our veterans for recognizing  this cause and rising to  its defense  with unfailing strength. Our gratitude  is tribute to your great bravery and  profound sacrifice.  f  ",2007

2657,120,2007-11-08,Mr. DURBIN.," I just have one question for the Senator from New Hampshire. As I understand it, the President  is going to ask for $196 billion for 1  more year in the war in Iraq, not paid  for.  So would  the Senator  be  voting  against the President’s request for $196  billion, unpaid for, to continue the war  in Iraq?  ",2007
2658,120,2007-11-08,Mr. GREGG.," Well, that  is a good  question, an excellent question. And  the answer is, the first obligation of a  Federal Government is to defend the  country. And when you have soldiers in  the  field, you do that. You pay  for  them being in the field.  I would suggest the way we could pay  for that, in fact, would be that we not  waive the pay-go rules for this $143 billion of spending which has nothing do  with national defense or, alternatively,  we could eliminate the $23 billion of  nondefense spending which has been  added by the Democratic Party in this  year’s budget cycle. That would save us  a significant amount of money.  So I would be happy to pay for it by  cutting either of those accounts. But,  in any event, I am going to pay for soldiers who are in the field.  ",2007
2659,120,2007-11-08,Mr. DURBIN., Will the Senator yield  for a further question?  ,2007
2660,120,2007-11-08,Mr. GREGG., I would be honored.  ,2007
2661,120,2007-11-08,Mr. DURBIN., Can the Senator tell  me how many Presidents in the history  of the United States of America have  proposed tax cuts in the midst of a  war?  ,2007
2662,120,2007-11-08,Mr. GREGG.," Well, I would be happy  to respond to that if I knew the answer,  but I do not. But let me talk about the  tax cuts. The tax cuts which were put  in place were put in place prior to 9/11.  As a practical matter, had they not  been in place, the effect of the burst of  the Internet bubble in the late 1990s,  which was the occurrence of a dramatic  expansion of the economy with a paper  expansion of equities being issued for  companies which had value in the late  1990s, was a speculative event.  That collapse, coupled with the 9/11  attack which put this country  into  trauma, both physically and politically, but also  economically, would  have led us into a very severe recession  if we had not had those tax cuts.  The fact that we put those tax cuts  in place early in this administration  has led to economic growth, which has  led to 43 months of growth, 8.7 million  new  jobs, and  interestingly enough,  those tax cuts have actually led to our  revenues  today being at a historic  high. Over the last 3 years we have collected more money in revenue growth  than we have received at any time in  our history.  We are now getting 18.7 percent of  gross national product  in  revenues,  when historically we usually get about  18.2 percent. And the vast majority of  that revenue growth has come directly  from the cut in capital gains rates, as  we have received over $100 billion of  new revenue in just the capital gains  activity.  So I would say, first, the tax cut was  not put in place during the war. It was  put in place at the beginning of the  war; and, secondly, it has had the right  effect, which is to energize economic  expansion and energize revenue to the  Federal Government.  I do appreciate that question.  I yield the floor.  ",2007
2663,120,2007-11-08,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, how  much time is remaining on the Democratic side?  ",2007
2664,120,2007-11-08,The PRESIDING OFFICER., There remains 11 minutes.  ,2007
2665,120,2007-11-08,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, I have  the greatest respect for my colleague  from New Hampshire, and he and  I  have had many conversations about  our views on spending and budget policy.  Although he is critical of the pay-as-  you-go approach, which the Democrats  have brought  to Congress  since we  came into the majority this year, the  fact is, the Republicans, the so-called  fiscally conservative party, never, ever  initiated pay as you go.  What is ‘‘pay as you go’’? It is something with which every family is familiar. If you want to buy a new washer  and dryer, do you have the money? If  you do not have the money, you do not  do it. You may borrow the money, but  we are trying to avoid that.  Pay as you go says, if you want to  spend new money on new projects, you  either have to raise taxes or cut spending. If you want to cut taxes, you either have to increase another tax or  cut spending. It is just that simple.  The Republicans,  the  fiscally conservative party, or so they brand themselves, did not initiate this. The Democrats did. And we are living by it.  The Senator quarrels with some of  the conclusions on various bills. But he  has to concede, I hope, the point that  we are doing this, and doing it in a fiscally responsible way, and it is painful.  It is not easy. It was far easier when  the Republicans controlled Congress.  They gave tax cuts to the wealthiest  people in America, adding to our deficit without cutting spending on programs, without increasing other taxes.  They gave tax cuts.  When the Senator from New Hampshire  says  that when  the President  asked for $196 billion for the next year  for the war because he wants to stand  behind our soldiers, he expresses a partial sentiment we all share. We don’t  want to shortchange the soldiers  in  any way. But  isn’t the  fiscally and  morally responsible way to fund a war  to pay for it? The documentary of Ken  Burns on World War II talked a lot  about the sacrifices Americans made to  fund the war. It ran up quite a debt.  Families across America bought U.S.  savings bonds to help fund the debts of  America. It was a special effort, a special sacrifice. This President, this administration has never asked for that  level of sacrifice  from anyone other  than the soldiers and their families.  Instead, what he has said to the rest  of America is: While we wage a war  that costs almost $200 billion a year,  $10 or $12 billion a month, we are going  to give tax cuts to the wealthiest. So  when my colleague from New Hampshire comes to give us pious exhortations about fiscal soundness, I am at  a loss to understand how he can continue to vote for the war and $196 billion that is not paid for. If he believes  we have to pay as you go, why wouldn’t  he want to pay for the war as we go?  Clearly, he makes an exception.  When the President receives a bill  such as the Labor-Health and Human  Services legislation, which has $10 billion more in spending than he asked  for, he says he will veto it. What is included in that $10 billion? For the first  time since the President came up with  the notion of No Child Left Behind, we  are going to make a massive investment to help school districts get test  scores up,  improve the education of  kids. The President vetoes it. He voted  for the test. He voted for the critique  of schools but would not provide the resources for those schools to improve  test scores.  There  is also money  in there the  President didn’t ask for, for medical research at the National Institutes of  Health. I would take that one on, on  the stump, with the President any day.  Let’s have a debate on that. Should we  spend $196 billion on the war in Iraq or  should we at least put enough money  in to improve medical research at the  National Institutes of Health? It is a  small  amount  in  comparison. Most  Americans believe as  I do,  that a  strong America begins at home. It begins at home with health insurance for  our children, a bill the President vetoed. It begins at home with better  schools for our kids, which the President is about to veto on the Labor-  Health and Human Services legislation.

2669,127,2007-11-08,Mr. KENNEDY.," Mr. President, last  night the House passed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act with a  strong bipartisan vote. The House bill  prohibits  employers  from  discriminating against workers on the job because of their sexual orientation. It  protects Americans from being fired,  denied a job or promotion, or otherwise  intentionally discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. Although the bill is narrower than many  of us had hoped, the House action is  still a main step in the long journey toward full civil rights for every American.  In the Senate, I will work to move  the Employment Non-Discrimination  Act this Congress. The bill that the  House passed is being held at the desk,  and I am working with leadership to  move this bill forward as quickly as  possible.  This Nation was founded on the principle of equal justice for all. That noble  goal represents the best in America—  that everyone should be treated fairly  and should have the chance to benefit  from the many opportunities of this  country. The House action brings us  closer to that goal.  Forty-three  years  ago,  President  Lyndon Johnson signed into law the  Civil Rights Act of 1964. At that time,  some in our country were violently opposed to outlawing racial discrimination, and it was very difficult for Congress to reach a consensus. But the  best in America, and the best in the  Senate,  prevailed. My  first major  speech in this body as a freshman Senator was on that Civil Rights Act. I  said then that I ‘‘firmly believe a sense  of fairness and goodwill also exists in  the minds and hearts’’ of Americans,  and that laws creating the conditions  for equality will help that spirit of fairness win out over prejudice, and I still  believe that today.  Since the 1964 act was passed, we  have seen enormous progress in this beloved Nation of ours. Civil rights laws  giving national protection against discrimination based on race, national origin, gender, age, and disability have  made our Country a stronger, better,  fairer  land.  African  Americans,  Latinos, Native Americans, and Asians  have made extraordinary advances in  the workplace. People with disabilities  have new opportunities to fully participate in our society. The workplace is  far more open to women in ways that  were barely imagined four decades ago.  In  countless  businesses,  large  and  small, glass ceilings are being shattered. Women and girls have far greater opportunities in the classroom and  in the boardroom.  But  that  progress  has  left  some  Americans out. Civil rights is still the  Nation’s unfinished business. Today, it  is perfectly legal in most States to fire  an employee because of sexual orientation or gender  identity. Many hard-  working Americans live every day with  the knowledge that, no matter what  their talents and abilities, they can be  denied a  job simply because of who  they are. Many young students grow up  knowing that no matter how hard they  study, the doors of opportunity will be  locked by prejudice and bigotry when  they enter the workplace.  Although some States have outlawed  job discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, in most  of the country, workers have no recourse at all if they are fired because  simply because of who they are. That is  unacceptable, and we have a duty to fix  it, and to do so on our watch.  In the past 40 years, our Country has  made great progress  in guaranteeing  fairness and opportunity.  When we passed the Civil Rights Act  of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965  and then the fair housing acts of 1968  and 1988, we took courageous steps, and  we were proud that the Senate did the  right thing each time. We must also do  the  right  thing—the  courageous  thing—today. In the 1960s, these laws  were controversial. But today, none of  us, Democrat, Republican,  or  Independent, would question that they were  the right steps to take, and we must  take the right steps today.  Over the years, the Senate has recognized time and again the importance of  our goal of equal employment opportunity. Even if we have sometimes disagreed about its proper interpretation,  there is no division among us that the  principle of equal employment opportunity is a core American value.  That is what the Employment Non-  Discrimination Act is all about—equal  job opportunities for all Americans. By  extending the protection of title VII to  those who are victimized because of  their sexual orientation, we are moving  closer to that  fundamental goal. No  one should be denied a job simply because of who they are.  That ideal is at the heart of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.  In 1996, we fell one vote short of passing the bill in the U.S. Senate. In the  decade since, public support for outlawing such discrimination has only  grown stronger. Now that the House  has acted, I hope that we will be able  to  finally succeed  in the Senate  in  passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act this Congress, and I look  forward to the coming debate.  America stands  for  justice  for all.  Congress must make clear that when  we say ‘‘all’’ we mean all. America will  never be America until we do.  f  FARM, NUTRITION, AND  BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007  ",2007

2672,127,2007-11-08,Mr. HARKIN.," Mr. President, for the  benefit of all Senators, we are now  back on the farm bill. The farm bill  was laid down 2 days ago, on Tuesday.  We have asked the other side if they  want to offer amendments, but we have  seen no amendments. We have one  amendment pending. The Grassley-Dorgan or Dorgan-Grassley—I don’t know  which came first on it—amendment is  pending. But we have heard from the  leader on the other side that they want  to offer amendments.

2674,134,2007-11-08,Mr. ALLARD.," Mr. President, I note  with some interest that ‘‘agriculture’’  does not appear in the title. It is called  the Food and Energy Security Act. I  think that in this particular piece of  legislation, we are missing the boat,  with commodity prices up, doing very  well, and generally rural America is in  a better position—at  least  in Colorado—than it has been in recent history. I think this would have been a  good time to bring forward some reform in the agricultural programs. I  am disappointed we don’t have any reform in this particular piece of legislation. I do have some amendments I  would like to be considered.  I noticed that the chairman of the  committee said no Republican amendments are coming forward. That is not  true,  the amendment  tree has been  filled. That means  if you bring an  amendment, you cannot call it up. You  don’t have that opportunity. So we  have some very serious amendments  that I would like to bring up for discussion on this bill. Our staff has been  working  some with  the agricultural  staff on some of these amendments. We  think we will reach agreement on some  of  them. There may be  several on  which  I would want to have votes.  These are serious amendments which I  think are important—items that ought  to be brought up before the Senate for  discussion and ought to be reviewed. I  think they have some value in what we  are trying to propose.  I am anxiously hoping that we can  put the bill in a posture so that amendments can be applied. I know the ranking Republican, along with Senator  HARKIN, have worked hard on this piece  of  legislation. There are some good  things in it; they are not all bad. I appreciate  their  effort  on what  they  worked on together.  There are some things that continue  to concern me: We have expansion of  Davis-Bacon; we have tax increases and  some budget gimmicks to make it look  as if there is not as much spending as  there is. Frankly, there is a lack of reform. I haven’t made up my mind on  how I will vote on final passage of this  bill. I am waiting to see what it will  look like after amendments have been  adopted on the floor, if any, if we get  an opportunity to do that. Hopefully,  we can pass this bill in a way that  won’t  adversely  impact  our  trade  agreements.  This  is another concern that gets  brought up in relation to this issue. We  have to be careful we don’t do things  that adversely affect our trade agreements, which come back and haunt us  and reverse policies that may be decided and be applied to the agricultural  industry and lose some of our export  markets, which are so very important.  Colorado is one of those States in the  agriculture area that have benefited by  these  free-trade agreements—NAFTA  in particular—and we continue to export our beef and our grain. They continue to be a valuable part of our economy. Agriculture is important to the  State of Colorado. But if we can move  more toward a market-based way of  managing our agricultural produce, I  think we would be much better off.  So every piece of legislation that has  come up in the Senate has a tax increase in it, or they call it revenue  enhancers. Many of them are, frankly,  tax increases, or they may be fee increases.  I want to take a little bit of time on  the floor to talk about tax reform. Mr.  President, I rise to talk about the issue  of taxes. This issue is very important  to the hard-working men and women of  our great country. I think we need to  look seriously at tax reform.  I believe the Federal tax burden is  excessive and overly intrusive. Reform  of the IRS and the current system is  long overdue. In recent years, it has become abundantly clear that we have  lost sight of the fact that the fundamental purpose of our tax system is to  raise revenues to fund our Government.  In its current application, the U.S. tax  system distorts the economic decisions  of families and businesses, leading to  an inefficient allocation of resources  and hindering economic growth. Our  tax system has become unstable and  unpredictable.

2675,141,2007-11-08,Mr. SALAZAR.," Madam President,  Congress has passed 23 other ad hoc  disaster  assistance  bills  since  1988.  Since 1988, 23 ad hoc disaster assistance  measures have been passed by the Congress.  Now, if this is not an indicator of the  need for the creation of a permanent  mechanism to deal with these disasters  in farm country, I do not know what  better indicator we need. Twenty-three  emergency disaster pieces of  legislation have passed this Congress since  1988.  I am supportive of that assistance,  but we need to deal with this problem  in an effective way and on a long-term  basis. That is what we have done in the  legislation. The members of the Agriculture Committee—and the Presiding  Officer, as a member of  that committee, has done a tremendous job in  her freshman year as a Senator, contributing in a huge way to many of the  titles we have included in the farm bill,  including helping write significant portions of title IX, the energy part of the  farm bill. I am very proud of her contribution.  But what we have done in this bill  with respect to permanent disaster assistance  is  to work with  Senator  and Senator BAUCUS and  members of the Finance Committee, in  a proactive way, to create a permanent  trust fund for disaster assistance.  The disaster trust fund will dedicate  over $5 billion during the next 5 years  to disaster relief. This will allow us to  maintain discipline and high standards  for determining when to pay out disaster funds, and it will allow producers  to get help more quickly. The trust  fund also brings disaster relief back  onto the books so it is part of the budget of the national Government. This is  a smart and fiscally responsible move.  I have spent a lot of time in my life  in  rural  communities—living  there,  making a living there for part of my  GRASSLEY life—and as a Senator and as attorney  general for my State, I have been in all  64 counties in my State many times  over the last decade.  Now, I do not buy the argument that  all is well in farm country. I believe we  have huge problems in farm country.  During the 1990s, in my State of Colorado, many of the counties in my State  were deemed to be some of the fastest  growing, more robust economic counties in terms of growth in the United  States of America. The State of Colorado was seen as one of the  fastest  growing States in the entire Nation,  and everybody was singing hallelujah  to the kind of economic blessings that  were being showered upon my State of  Colorado. But if you traveled through  44 of the 64 counties in my State, you  would have to say those counties were,  in fact, doing as badly as they were in  the 1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s. Indeed, not much has changed. In fact,  the economic decline, including population decline, in those counties continues to be a reality and a way of life.  In many of those communities where  there used to be three grocery stores,  now they were down to zero, and in  many of them perhaps one. In many of  those places where there used to be  three filling stations, they were down  to  zero  filling  stations and perhaps  only one.  In fact, in the town closest to our  ranch, the town of Manasa, CO—this is  a story of what has happened there.  When I was growing up there and going  to school at Manasa Elementary, I remember  the  three  stores  on Main  Street. I remember the gas stations on  Main Street. Well, today we are down  to one gas station, and we are down to  one small grocery store in the town of  Manasa. So not all  is well  in  farm  country.  So today and this week and next  week as we work on this farm bill, it is  our effort to try to make sure rural  America is revitalized. So this is an opportunity for us to make sure we reinvigorate and revitalize rural America  and create a whole new chapter of opportunity.  This disaster trust fund which we are  creating will help us deal with disasters. The other parts of the farm bill  will also create huge opportunities for  rural America.  I will conclude by saying this—because there will be other times when  we will come to talk about other parts  of this farm bill. For me, one of the  most exciting chapters of this farm bill  for 2007 is, we are creating the opportunity for rural America, for farmers  and ranchers to help grow our way to  energy  independence. This  is not a  Democratic or a Republican issue; it is  not a progressive or a conservative  issue. This is an issue of national security for the United States of America.  That is why so many people have come  together to celebrate this agenda that  we are embracing on a clean energy future for America.

2677,148,2007-11-08,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, I am disappointed that we haven’t been able to  accomplish more on the farm bill. We  have asked for amendments Senators  want to offer. There have been a number filed. I have asked that Republicans  come up with a  list of amendments  they would like to have considered. It  appears there is no effort made to work  out arrangements on  the  farm bill  passing.  I state  for the record that  every farm bill we have handled in recent decades has never had nonrelevant  amendments. They have all been relevant, with one exception.  In 2002, the last one we did, we had  one nonrelevant amendment. It was a  sense-of-the-Senate resolution on the  estate tax. That is it. So I don’t know,  maybe the Republicans don’t want a  farm bill. Maybe they have all cowered  as a result of the President saying he  was going to veto it.  As you know, the President has developed a new word in his vocabulary,  and that is ‘‘veto.’’ For 7 years he was  not able to mouth that word, but in the  last few months, the last year of his  Presidency, he has decided to do that.  Maybe the Republicans don’t want a  farm bill. Maybe they want to  join  with the President and not have a farm  bill. That certainly appears to be the  case.  We have basically wasted the whole  week with my friends on the other side  of the aisle pouting about procedure.  The procedure on this bill is no different than any other farm bill we have  done in recent decades.  The State of Nevada would benefit a  little bit from the farm bill but not  much. I hope those constituencies who  want a farm bill will start contacting  Senators because the time is fast passing.  f  DEPARTMENT  OF  DEFENSE  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT,  2008—CONFERENCE REPORT  ",2007

The assistant legislative clerk read  as follows:  The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the  amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R.  3222) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede  from its disagreement to the amendment of  the Senate and agree to the same with an  amendment, and the Senate agree to the  same, signed by a majority of the conferees  on the part of both Houses.

2683,148,2007-11-08,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. President, I just  have a comment to add to those of Senator BONDabout the danger to farmers  of making mistakes on energy policy.  Energy prices are rising significantly. I  saw some numbers recently that indicated for an average family, where one  person commuted  29 miles  to work  every day, $3-a-gallon gasoline could  mean $60 to $80 a month more than  they would pay  for gasoline alone.  That is after-tax money out of their  pockets. That is a real cost.  We absolutely need to strengthen the  energy portion of this bill. We need to  do more to have a domestic supply of  energy. But we also need to be sure we  are not driving up the cost of energy so  it falls hard on people such as farmers  who utilize a lot of energy and a lot of  gasoline and diesel fuel. It could be a  real problem for them. I agree with  Senator BONDthat we need to be careful about this because we should not  have as our goal driving up the cost of  energy.  A lot of the policies I am hearing  about are going to have little impact  on the environment but a lot of impact  on our wallets. My thoughts about the  Ag bill are that I hope we will be able  to pass a bill we can be proud of. I hope  to be able to support it. That is what I  am  looking  to do.  I will offer an  amendment or file it a little later—I  know we are not voting on them now—  to deal with assisting farmers who suffer losses from disasters in their region.  It can be painful  for them.  I  would like to share some thoughts on  this.  Our current crop insurance, as valuable as it is, has not proven to provide  a fully adequate financial safety net  for our farmers. The current system  can be too expensive and not flexible  enough. Farmers come to me all the  time and say: I would  like to plow  under this crop and replant now, but  the insurance people think if I let it go  to full maturity, I might make enough  money off of it that I wouldn’t have to  claim any insurance. So you have to  wait on the  insurance people before  making a decision. They  come out  there. They have to make judgments.  This is a burden. It can eliminate quick  decisionmaking and can be costly.  According to the Congressional Research Service,  the Government-subsidized Crop Insurance Program has expanded significantly over the last 25  years, and that is what we wanted to  happen. We wanted more  farmers to  take out crop insurance. But yet CRS  has found that despite this expansion,  the ‘‘anticipated goal of crop insurance  replacing disaster payments has not  been achieved.’’ Indeed, CRS reports  that since 2000, ‘‘the federal subsidy to  the Crop Insurance Program has averaged about $3.25 billion per year, up  from an annual average of $1.1 billion  in the 1990s and about $500 million in  the 1980s.  During this same time, from 1999 to  2006, CRS reports that the average per  year ad hoc periodic disaster payment  to fund persons who need payments in  addition to the crop insurance has totaled $1.3 billion a year. Since 2002,  CRS reports that the cost to the Federal Government of Crop  Insurance  Programs combined with ad hoc supplemental disaster payments has averaged $4.5 billion per year.  According to the Risk Management  Agency, a group that supervises crop  insurance, the average subsidy rate for  this year—that is the average subsidy  rate, the amount of money the taxpayers provide to subsidize a farmer’s  crop  insurance—amounted to 58 percent of a producer’s total crop insurance premium. The average amount of  the Government subsidy is $3,359. I am  convinced  for some  farmers—I don’t  know  how  many—more  flexibility  could result in more benefits for those  farmers. That is, of course, what we are  about, trying to make sure we get the  maximum possible disaster risk protection we can for our farmers.  Farmers do have a real need for a  viable risk management strategy. Certainly, farmers need some form of protection when  disasters  strike. But  these numbers do demonstrate the traditional crop insurance coverage on a  VerDate Mar 15 2010  21:24 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S08NO7.REC S08NO7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007
2684,155,2007-11-08,Mr. MCCAIN.," Mr. President, we are a  country at war and yet it is business as  usual in the Halls of the Congress. This  conference report  is chocked  full of  unrequested and unauthorized funding  provisions while actually underfunding  the budget requested by the President  for the Department of Defense by $3.5  billion. That is correct, Mr. President.  We are underfunding one of the most  critical agencies to the safety and security of the American public in order  to spend extraordinary amounts on unnecessary, wasteful earmarks and run  of the mill porkbarrel projects. There  are over 2,000 earmarks in this year’s  Defense Appropriations conference report and its accompanying Statement  of Managers, with 24 earmarks added  outside the scope of conference.  Today, we are engaged in a struggle  against  Islamic  fascism and yet  it  seems that many on both sides of the  aisle are placing special interest and  pet projects before the urgent funding  needs of our troops and providing what  they need to succeed in their mission.  While this bill has $3 billion of Katrina  relief  for Louisiana homeowners,  it  does not have one dime allotted for  bridge funds for the global war on terror. I support doing what we can do to  aid in the Katrina recovery. But we  must be  equally  committed  to our  brave men and women in uniform.  Allow me to highlight some of the  earmarks that are taking real money  away  from  our  fighting men  and  women: $25,000,000 for the Hawaii Federal Health Care Network; $23,000,000  for the National Drug Intelligence Center, NDIC; $20,000,000  for historically  Black  colleges  and  universities;  $5,000,000 for the United States Olympic  Committee, USOC Paralympic Military  Program;  $4,800,000  for  the Jamaica  Bay Unit of Gateway National Recreation Area; $3,000,000  for  ‘‘The First  Tee,’’ a golf foundation in St. Augustine, FL; $2,400,000 for the Vertical Lift  Center of Excellence-Institute of Maintenance,  Science  and  Technology;  $2,000,000 for brown tree snake eradication;  $1,600,000  for  the New York  Structural Biology Center;  $1,200,000  for the National Bureau for Asian Research; $800,000 for extended shelf life  produce for remotely deployed forces;  and $500,000 for the Maine Institute for  Human Genetics.  I am not questioning the merits of  some of these programs and initiatives  but they do not belong on a Defense appropriations bill.  It  is our responsibility to be faithful stewards of the  taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars. Whatever position you have on the war in  Iraq, the global war on terror or this  administration, as long as our soldiers,  sailors, airmen and marines are  in  harm’s way, it is our responsibility to  provide them with whatever  is necessary  for them to succeed  in their  missions around the world and come  home safely. We can do better than  this for our troops and for the American taxpayer.∑  ",2007
2685,155,2007-11-08,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I oppose the 2008 Department of Defense  appropriations  conference  report because it provides money to continue  the misguided war in Iraq but fails to  require  the  redeployment  of  U.S.  troops. The war in Iraq is the wrong  war. It is overstretching our military  and undermining our national security.  It is long past time for this war to end.  Some may pretend  that  this conference report does not  include any  Iraq money. That claim is misleading,  at best. This bill provides the regular  DOD funding that keeps the war going.  In fact, this bill will pay for a significant part of our operations  in Iraq.  Moreover, there is nothing in this bill  to prevent  the Defense Department  from shifting regular funds to pay for  the full costs of the war in Iraq in the  event that the Congress does not enact  supplemental  appropriations  for  the  war.  I strongly support our brave men and  women in uniform. We do not do them  any  favors by giving  the President  money to keep this open-ended war  going with no strings attached. For  their sake, and for the sake of our national  security, we  should use  our  power of the purse to force the President to bring this war to a close. This  bill represents another missed opportunity, and another example of Congress failing to use its power to bring  our troops out of Iraq.  ",2007
2686,155,2007-11-08,Mr. AKAKA.," Mr. President, I would  like to urge my colleagues to support  the conference report to accompany  the fiscal year 2008 Department of Defense appropriations bill. I would also  like to thank all of the House and Senate conferees for their hard work and  dedication to ensure that our troops  and their  families have all the necessary  equipment and  support  they  need.  As both a  senior member of  the  Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I am particularly pleased to support $70 million  in  funding  for programs authorized under the Dignified  Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act,  designed  to  assist members  of  our  Armed Forces and their families in the  often difficult transition from battlefield to home. I am also glad to support  the inclusion of $980 million in additional funds to ensure that National  Guard and Reserve  forces have  the  equipment they need to train for deployments abroad and to respond to  natural disasters at home.  In addition, I applaud the conferees’  decision to retain a provision recognizing  the dedication and  sacrifices  made by members of our Armed Forces  and their civilian counterparts, by providing a 3.5-percent increase in basic  pay for all service members and civilian personnel, 0.5 percent above the  President’s  request. Similarly,  I am  pleased to support the inclusion of $2.6  billion to be used for the immediate  needs of our military families. These  funds which will be used to hire counselors, teachers, and child care providers are critical  for our military  readiness and for sustaining our troops  by ensuring  the well-being of  their  families.  Once again,  let me urge my colleagues to set aside differences and  reach the compromises necessary to  provide our brave men and women in  the armed services with the resources  they need.  ",2007
2687,155,2007-11-08,Mr. BYRD.," Mr. President, I certify  that the information required by Senate rule XLIV, related to congressionally directed spending, has been identified in the conference report to accompany H.R. 3222, Department of Defense  appropriations bill, 2008, House Report  110–434, filed on November 6, 2007, and  that the required information has been  available on a publicly accessible congressional Web site at least 48 hours  before a vote on the pending conference  report.

This  Defense bill, which I strongly support,  unfortunately  includes  a  so-called  ‘‘continuing resolution’’ which is full  of earmarks.  I am extremely disappointed that our  troops must continue to pay the price  for political posturing and the inclusion of funding for pet programs in a  must-pass military  funding bill. Our  troops are being used to carry pork  projects and this is a text book example of irresponsible legislating.  Let’s be clear about what a continuing resolution is. This continuing  resolution provides stopgap funding for  existing Federal programs at current  or reduced fiscal year levels because  the majority couldn’t get its appropriations bills completed by the beginning  of a new fiscal year.  What we should be considering is a  straight CR: no earmarks, no plus ups,  no new  ‘‘emergency’’ spending. This  bill has it all. It has a $3 million earmark  for a golf center—an expense  clearly not linked to our national defense. There is even $800,000 to study  the effects of sound on marine mammals.  This is a dangerous way to operate.  This Congress has already shown it  has zero fiscal discipline. Business as  usual is bad enough, but if we, the U.S.  Senate, concede on the definition of a  CR, this kind of unconscionable spending will be done  forever. It will be  standard operating procedure. That is  not what the American people want.  I want to make very clear my strong  support for the members of our Armed  Forces and the vital work they are  doing around the world every day. I  have the greatest admiration for all of  them  for their commitment to preserving our freedoms and maintaining  our national security.

2689,162,2007-11-08,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, these distinguished military officers, flag officers,  people who  are  charged with  knowing what is our law, what is our  Constitution, what are our treaty commitments, and what are the rules our  military must follow, write with absolute clarity, and I quote the significant  sentence from their letter:  Waterboarding is inhumane, it is torture,  and it is illegal.  They also quote the sitting judge advocates general of the military services  from our committee’s hearing last year  in which they unanimously and unambiguously agreed that waterboarding is  inhumane, it is illegal, it is a violation  of law.  Think for a moment, if another nation  picked  up  an American  and  waterboarded that American and we  heard about it; no Senator, no American would have  to know  the  circumstances  and  the  purported  justifications for it. We would condemn it.  All 100 of us would be on the floor condemning it, and 435 members of the  other body would be condemning  it.  Whoever was President of the United  States would  condemn  it. But you  know what, that was before this debate  began, and now, tragically, this administration has so twisted America’s role  and our laws and values that apparently our own State Department is now  ordered  they  cannot  say  that  waterboarding of an American is illegal.  Mr. President, that  is how  far we  have sunk. I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the RECORDa copy of a  letter I sent to Secretary Rice protesting this order.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  U.S. SENATE,  COMMITTEEONTHEJUDICIARY,  Washington, DC, November 6, 2007.  Hon. CONDOLEEZZARICE,  Secretary of State,  Washington, DC.  DEARSECRETARYRICE: There are reports  that one of your principal aides and legal advisers, a Mr. John Bellinger, is taking the  legal position that he cannot say whether it  is permissible to waterboard Americans and  that  it  depends  on  the  facts  and  circumstances.  I  could  not  disagree more  strongly. There are no conceivable facts or  circumstances  that would  justify waterboarding an American anywhere in the world  for any reason. Our treaty obligations and  domestic  law make waterboarding  illegal.  Please respond without delay and set this  matter straight.  Sincerely,  PATRICKLEAHY,  Chairman.  ",2007
2690,162,2007-11-08,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, senior  State Department  legal officers are  told  that waterboarding, which has  been recognized as torture, not for the  last 10 years or 50 years or 100 years,  but has been recognized as torture for  the  last 500 years,  is a  ‘‘technique’’  they cannot rule out as something a  foreign intelligence service might be  justified in using against Americans.  This is ‘‘Alice in Wonderland.’’  Never mind  that President Teddy  Roosevelt, no shrinking violet he, prosecuted American soldiers for this more  than 100 years ago. Never mind that we  prosecuted  Japanese  soldiers  for  waterboarding Americans during World  War II. Never mind what repressive regimes are doing to this day around the  world. It is appalling.  When it comes to our core values—  the  things  that make  our  country  great, that define America’s place in  the world—it does not depend on the  circumstances; it depends on our core  values. America, the great and good  nation that has been a beacon to the  rest of the world on human rights, does  not torture, it should not stand for torture, and it should stand against torture.  I ask unanimous consent  to have  printed in the RECORDa copy of a letter I received from the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, dated  November 1.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  NATIONALRELIGIOUSCAMPAIGN  AGAINSTTORTURE,  Washington, DC, November 1, 2007.  Hon. PATRICKLEAHY,  Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, 433 Russell Senate Office Building,  U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.  DEARSENATORLEAHY: The National Religious Campaign Against Torture (NRCAT), a  campaign of over 130 religious organizations  working together to abolish U.S.-sponsored  torture and cruel,  inhuman or degrading  treatment of anyone, without exception, is  deeply concerned about the responses Judge  Michael Mukasey gave both at his nomination hearing and in his most recent written  response on the subject of torture. We believe his answers leave open the door to the  use of techniques by the U.S. government  that would be cruel, inhuman and degrading  and that could amount to torture. This is  true not only for waterboarding, which is  clearly illegal and a form of torture, but also  for a number of other techniques we understand the CIA has used and may continue to  use.  Our country already knows what happens  when we have an Attorney General who  countenances torture and cruel, inhuman or  degrading  treatment. We  lose our moral  compass; decent Americans are called upon  on our behalf to commit acts that damage  their souls; our soldiers who may be captured are placed in greater jeopardy; we are  shamed in the eyes of the world.  It is time to turn a new page; the confirmation of a new Attorney General is such  an opportunity. It would be tragic to allow  an individual who has not clearly rejected  the illegal and immoral practices of torture  and cruel, inhuman degrading treatment to  become the leading law enforcement officer  of our nation.

I will say it again: In my  view, waterboarding is torture, it is illegal, and it is inhumane. And Judge  Mukasey has refused to acknowledge  that fact. Mr. President, I cannot, in  good  conscience,  overlook  Judge  Mukasey’s equivocation on torture.  Our laws are clear. We need an Attorney General who will enforce those  laws, including the laws against torture, no matter what.

2697,197,2007-11-08,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, the  President of the United States is pursuing a strategy towards Iran that is  badly  flawed, dangerous, and  likely  doomed to failure. I am deeply concerned about Iran’s nuclear program  and its support for terrorism, and by  indications that it is aiding groups in  Iraq that are killing American troops,  but the administration has so far failed  to come up with an effective way to address these very serious matters.  For instance, less than 2 weeks ago  the administration designated the Quds  Force of  the  Islamic Revolutionary  Guards Corps as a material supporter  of terrorism, and the IRGC  for proliferation activities.  I  support  sanctions that target proliferators and have  introduced  legislation  that  would  strengthen our sanctions regime, but  the designation of Iranian government  entities  raises new policy questions  that do not seem to have been fully explored, and it may very well be counterproductive.  Moreover, this poorly timed action  undermines efforts to win support for  multilateral initiatives. Instead of acting alone, we  should maintain and  strengthen the international community’s collective ability to counter Iranian ambitions, including with regard  to its nuclear program.  Iran’s actions pose serious threats to  our national security. But aggressive  saber-rattling is not an appropriate or  effective response. The administration  has shown repeatedly that  it  is too  quick to turn to military power, and  its threat, to address problems overseas. It has also shown time and again  an inability to see the big picture. And  it still seems to prefer unilateral over  multilateral approaches. All of these  are mistakes we cannot afford to have  repeated.  We can’t focus on Iran in isolation,  the way the administration has focused  for so long on Iraq without considering  a broader context or taking a more  comprehensive approach.  Instead of repeating the myopia of  Iraq,  the administration  should approach the problem of Iran through a  more  strategic  lens one  that  incorporates a broader and more integrated  vision,  that  takes  into account  regional concerns, and that is consistent  with our top national security priority,  which is the fight against al-Qaida and  its affiliates. We need a national security strategy that addresses al-Qaida,  Iran, Iraq, and the many other problems we face. Instead, the administration prefers to focus on Iraq, and now  Iran, as if we had the luxury of addressing these challenges in isolation.  We must vigorously oppose any efforts by Iran to acquire nuclear weapons and its support to terrorist organizations that goes almost without saying. But we must curb these actions by  seeing the whole board and by using  more of the tools at our disposal. And  that is not happening. Instead, the administration  is  taking  an unnecessarily belligerent approach that runs  the risk of increasing our vulnerability, both at home and abroad.  The United States should be working  in unison with the international community, which shares our concern over  Iran’s nuclear program. At the same  time as the new sanctions were announced, the European Union’s foreign  policy chief, Javier Solana, was meeting in Rome with Iran’s negotiators to  discuss Tehran’s nuclear program and  discussions among the EU+ 3 comprised  of France, Germany and the UK plus  China, Russia and U.S.—are likely to  continue at the end of November following the completion of another IAEA  report.  In the past, Secretary Rice and others at State have publicly supported  these talks and expressed confidence in  the negotiations. But the administration’s hard line position is unlikely to  win over Russia and China, without  whom there can be little progress.  The administration should be trying  to persuade our friends and allies to increase their economic pressure on Iran,  ideally through the U.N. Rather than  imposing  unilateral  sanctions,  we  should be pressing the EU to announce  multilateral  sanctions, which would  have a much greater impact given that  we have not traded or invested in Iran  for nearly 30 years. Instead, our bellicose rhetoric and hard-line approach  could be undermining our ability to  gain support from—Russia, China and  even from some EU countries—to implement multilateral  sanctions  that  Iran cannot ignore.  Trying to unilaterally  isolate Iran  further is unlikely to curb its nuclear  program. And it won’t make sure that  Iran does not aid the proliferation of  and access to weapons in Iraq. Veiled,  and not-so-veiled, threats of military  action aren’t  likely to work either.  They are, however, likely to embolden  Iran’s  hardliners  as  they  seek  to  thwart moderates in that country who  might otherwise encourage dialogue or  political reform.  Instead of using the Iraq focused bilateral  talks  that have occurred  in  Baghdad as a platform from which to  build, we are launching ourselves on to  a collision course that may further endanger U.S. troops in Iraq in the near  term. And that might only be the beginning. Our massive presence in Iraq  undermines our ability to deal with  Iran. It is draining our resources, exhausting our troops, exposing them to  potential Iranian attacks, and undermining our credibility.  We should redeploy our troops from  Iraq so that we can deal with Iran from  a position of greater strength. Instead,  the President is leading us deeper into  the quagmire that his misguided policies in Iraq created.  It is essential that those of us here in  Congress condemn the violent and defiant statements coming out of Iran. But  we also have a responsibility as a co-  equal branch of government to respond  to  this  administration’s  aggressive  words, ill-considered decisions and ad  hoc policies, particularly when they  may undermine our own national security. Dealing with Iran is a daunting  task. But we are only making it more  difficult with our  counterproductive  policies  of  isolation  and  war-  mongering. We cannot again succumb  to the shortsightedness that keeps us  fixated on Iraq and drains the attention and resources needed to combat  threats to our national security around  the world.  f  CORPORATE AVERAGE FUEL  ECONOMY STANDARDS  ",2007
2698,197,2007-11-08,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, as  Congress continues to work on comprehensive energy legislation, I want  to discuss the importance to my constituents of enacting strong yet achievable corporate average  fuel economy  standards.  The final energy package needs to increase vehicle  fuel economy requirements, but it should do so without undercutting  hardworking  families  in  Wisconsin and across the country. Between manufacturing, dealerships, and  the automotive parts industry, there  are upwards of 50,000 auto jobs in Wisconsin. Having grown up  in Janesville—home  to  a  General Motors  plant—I understand how important the  auto industry is to the State’s economy and its communities. For far too  long, under different administrations  and different Congresses, the U.S. has  pursued trade and other policies that  have undermined our country’s manufacturing base. Now, it is time to pay  attention to the concerns of America’s  workers.  We can have strong and achievable  CAFE standards. However, this will require several reasonable revisions to  the Energy bill that the Senate passed.  For  starters,  separate  standards  for  cars and trucks need to be maintained.  I recently organized a coalition of senators to write the Senate’s Democratic  leadership and urge it to maintain the  distinction  in  current  law  between  standards  for cars and  trucks. Passenger cars and light-duty trucks are  inherently different.

RES. 374  Whereas the Veterans History Project was  established by a unanimous vote of  the  United States Congress to collect and preserve the wartime stories of American veterans;  Whereas Congress charged the American  Folklife Center at the Library of Congress to  undertake the Veterans History Project and  to engage the public in the creation of a collection of oral histories that would be a lasting tribute to  individual veterans and an  abundant resource for scholars;  Whereas there are 17,000,000 wartime veterans in America whose stories can educate  people of all ages about important moments  and events  in the history of the United  States and the world and provide instructive  narratives that illuminate the meanings of  ‘‘service’’,  ‘‘sacrifice’’,  ‘‘citizenship’’,  and  ‘‘democracy’’;  Whereas the Veterans History Project relies on a corps of volunteer  interviewers,  partner organizations, and an array of civic  minded institutions nationwide who interview veterans according to the guidelines it  provides;  Whereas increasing public participation in  the Veterans History Project will increase  the number of oral histories that can be collected and preserved and increase the number of veterans it so honors; and  Whereas  ‘‘National Veterans Awareness  Week’’ commendably preceded this resolution in the years 2005 and 2006: Now, therefore, be it  Resolved, That the Senate—  (1) recognizes ‘‘National Veterans Awareness Week’’;  (2) supports the designation of a ‘‘National  Veterans History Project Week’’;  (3) calls on the people of the United States  to interview at least one veteran in their  families or communities according to guidelines  provided  by  the Veterans History  Project; and  (4) encourages local, State, and national  organizations along with Federal, State, city  and  county governmental  institutions  to  participate in support of the effort to document, preserve, and honor the service of  American wartime veterans.  f  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND  PROPOSED  SA 3566.

PETESTARKand  Speaker NANCYPELOSIare proud to rise today  to honor Teamsters Joint Council 7 on the occasion of their 100th anniversary. Theirs is a  proud history, whose origins in the days of the  California Gold Rush speak  to a  long-time  concern for the welfare of working people.  In the mid-1800s, when San Francisco was  a booming Gold Rush  town,  the Teamsters  Association was formed to address competition  from Australians who had arrived with  stronger horses. While not a true trade union,  it was the first teamster organization on the  West Coast and the precursor of Teamsters  Joint Council 7.  The Teamsters Association collapsed in the  depression of 1854, and  in 1856, a new  Draymen’s and Teamsters Union was formed.  By 1888, however,  the majority of working  teamsters had dropped out, leaving a guild of  employers and bosses. Due  to poor conditions, a second attempt was made to create a  union in 1900, and again the organization was  commandeered by employers.  The International Brotherhood of Teamsters  came into existence in 1903 and stepped up  to organize  local unions by occupation after  the 1906 earthquake led to a more complex  system of goods distribution. On November  18, 1907, the Joint Council was chartered to  oversee these groups.  By 1912 there were 13 groups ranging from  hackmen  to  ice wagon drivers. The  Joint  Council helped in disputes with employers as  well as differences among the locals, relieving  union officers of many routine duties and improving the welfare of the membership.  In  those early years, Teamsters Local 85  dominated the operations and provided notable leadership. Local 85 had demonstrated its  ability to create solidarity when they called a  strike  in 1901. Other  labor unions  rallied  around, and the employers backed down. This  action earned San Francisco a reputation as  the strongest ‘‘Union Town’’ in the nation.  Today Joint Council 7 has 15 affiliates and  serves the greater Bay Area from Santa Rosa  in the north to Salinas/Monterey in the south.  The current affiliates are:  Local 70, Oakland, Chuck Mack, Secretary-  Treasurer; Local 78, Hayward, Steve Mack,  Secretary-Treasurer; Local 85, San Francisco,  Van Beane, Secretary-Treasurer; Local 278,  San Francisco, Jack Bookter, Secretary-Treasurer; Local 287, San Jose, Bill Hoyt, Secretary-Treasurer; Local 315, Martinez, Dale  Robbins, Secretary-Treasurer; Local 350, Daly  City, Robert Morales,  Secretary-Treasurer;  Local 490, Vallejo, Carlos Borba, Secretary-  Treasurer; Local 624, Santa Rosa, Bob Carr,  Secretary-Treasurer;  Local  665, Daly City,  Ernie Yates, Secretary-Treasurer; Local 853,  San Leandro, Rome Aloise, Secretary-Treasurer; Local 856, San Bruno, Joseph Lanthier,  Secretary-Treasurer;  Local  890,  Salinas,  Franklin  Gallegos,  President;  Local  896,  Vallejo, Rene Medrano, Secretary-Treasurer;  Local 912, Watsonville, Brad Sebring, Secretary-Treasurer.  Under  the  leadership of president Chuck  Mack, who has served for 25 years, the organization has developed many additional functions. These include legal support, a commercial drivers’ training program, political activity  to support working families, alcohol and drug  treatment, and maintenance of a charitable  trust  to assist members after disasters and  tragedies as well as  to support community  causes.  Their own words say it best: ‘‘100 hundred  years old and our members are still priority  number one!’’  Madam Speaker, organized  labor  in  this  country has led to better wages, health care,  and pensions  for workers. Throughout  the  years, Teamsters  Joint Council 7 has  reaffirmed its commitment to the working families of the Bay Area. We all wish Joint Council  7 continued success in the future and hope  that their second hundred years will be as productive as the first hundred.  f  40TH ANNIVERSARY OF ELECTION  OF CARL B. STOKES AS MAYOR  OF CLEVELAND  HON. STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES  OFOHIO  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 8, 2007  ",2007
2713,246,2007-11-08,Mrs.  JONES of Ohio.," Madam Speaker,  today I rise in honor of a personal hero, Carl  B. Stokes. Today marks the 40th anniversary  of his historic election as mayor of the city of  Cleveland. The first African American mayor of  a large American city, Carl Stokes was an inspiration not only  to people of color, but all  Americans.  Carl Stokes was born June 21, 1927  in  Cleveland, OH to Charles Stokes, a laundry  worker, and Louise Stokes, a cleaning woman.  His father died when he was two, leaving his  mother to raise Carl, and his brother, my predecessor,  former Congressman Louis Stokes,  alone. They lived in Cleveland’s first federally  funded housing project for the poor Outhwaite  Homes.  Although a good student, Carl dropped out  of high school in 1944. He worked briefly for  Thompson Products before  joining  the U.S.  Army at the age of 18. Following his discharge  in 1946, Stokes  returned  to Cleveland and  earned his high school diploma in 1947.  He would attend several colleges before  earning his bachelor’s degree from the University of Minnesota in 1954. He went on to graduate from Cleveland-Marshall College of Law  in 1956 and was admitted to the Ohio bar in  1957.  While studying law he was a probation officer. For  four years, he served as assistant  prosecutor and became partner in the law firm  of Stokes, Stokes, Character, and Terry, and  continued  to practice  throughout his political  career.  In 1962, he became the first black elected  to the Ohio House of Representatives, where  he served for three terms. He made his first  run for mayor of Cleveland in 1965, narrowly  losing the bid. He would mount a second run  in 1967 where he was able to mobilize both  black and white voters to defeat Seth Taft, the  grandson of a former U.S. president William  Howard Taft, by a 50.5 majority. As mayor,  Stokes opened city hall  jobs  to blacks and  women and initiated Cleveland: Now!, a public  and private funding program aimed at the revitalization of Cleveland neighborhoods. Additionally, the National League of Cities elected  him as their first black president-elect. He was  reelected in 1969, and in 1971 chose not to  run for a third term.  After his mayoral administration, Stokes lectured to colleges around the country. In 1972  he became the first black anchorman in New  York City when he took a job with television  station WNBC–TV. He returned to Cleveland  in 1980 and began serving as general legal  counsel for the United Auto Workers.  In 1983, he decided to run for the municipal  court judgeship that I had vacated against an  incumbent judge appointee. This election was  the beginning of a long friendship that I could  have never dreamed of or anticipated as a  young volunteer on his 1967 campaign. From  1983 to 1994 he in that seat where he developed a reputation as a fair judge with a common sense approach to the law.  President Bill Clinton  then appointed him  U.S.  Ambassador  to  the  Republic  of  Seychelles. He was awarded 12 honorary degrees,  numerous  civic  awards,  and  represented  the United States  on  numerous  goodwill trips abroad by request of the White  House.  Along with all of Carl Stokes great achievements, he inspired a young, black college student who was volunteered to work on his 1967  mayoral campaign  to  follow her dreams. He  was a shining example  for  this young black  woman,  that  through hard work and determination you could do  the  impossible. That  young African American woman was me. I am  able to serve here in Congress as the first African American woman elected to the House  of Representatives from the state of Ohio, because Carl Stokes paved the way for me and  many others.  If  there were no Carl Stokes,  there would be no STEPHANIETUBBSJONES. I  am truly blessed to have been able to call him  and his brother my friend. So, it is my honor  and privilege to recognize this significant milestone today, and simply say, thank you Carl  Stokes  for your courage and  tenacity  forty  years ago, and for inspiring me to follow my  dreams.  f  HONORING AMBASSADOR RONALD  WEISER AS THE  2007 CHELSEA  CITIZEN OF THE YEAR  HON.

It is with  great admiration  that  I congratulate Ambassador Ronald Weiser on behalf of all who  have benefited from his hard work and dedication.

2715,253,2007-11-08,Mr. GEORGEMILLER.,"  This amendment clarifies the religious exemption under ENDA, addressing concerns raised  by some religious schools. It makes explicitly  clear that religious organizations are given an  identical exemption, under ENDA, to the one  found  in Title VII of  the Civil Rights Act of  1964. This provision exempts  religious corporations, schools, associations, and societies  from religious discrimination claims. Mr. MILLER’s amendment clarifies that both denominational  and  non-denominational  religious  schools qualify  for exemption  from ENDA.  I  thank my colleagues who joined me in supporting this amendment.  In addition, I would also like to express my  support for the amendment offered by my colleague, Ms. BALDWIN, and my disappointment  that  it was not adopted. This amendment  would have expanded ENDA’s protections to  persons discriminated against based on gender  identity, defined as  the gender-related  identity, appearance, or mannerisms or other  gender-related characteristics of an individual,  with or without regard to the individual’s designated sex at birth. This amendment highlighted the activism and dedication of individuals such as Phyllis Randolph Frye, a lawyer  in Houston who has struggled for the rights of  transgender people for decades. Further, the  language  included  in Representative BALDWIN’s  amendment  addresses  concerns  of  shared facilities, dress, and grooming standards, stating explicitly that the construction of  additional facilities is not required. If this legislation  is  to  truly achieve  its goals of equal  treatment for all Americans, this amendment is  tantamount to that success. I therefore strongly hope that my colleagues will join me in enacting this amendment in the future.  Furthermore, I oppose the motion to recommit on the grounds that it was designed to either permanently derail or at least delay this  historic legislation. In addition, the motion to  recommit was regarding the definition of marriage, which is utterly separate from workplace  discrimination.  Madam Chairman,  this non-discrimination  legislation  is good  for America:  it benefits  American citizens and American companies.  Non-discrimination protects  the civil rights of  individuals, and it has proven good for business in some of our nation’s most successful  businesses. Our nation is built on the ideals of  hard-work and equality, key values  that are  enshrined in today’s legislation.  I urge my colleagues  to  join me  in supporting this legislation, and in ensuring that all  American workers enjoy basic employment  protections.  f  WISHING  MRS.  BROWN  KIDD  BIRTHDAY  MAGGIE  A  HAPPY  KATIE  103RD  HON. DAVID SCOTT  OFGEORGIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 8, 2007  ",2007
2716,253,2007-11-08,Mr. SCOTT of Georgia.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to recognize an important milestone  in the life of my constituent Mrs. Maggie Katie  Brown Kidd. On December 8, 2007, Mrs. Kidd  will celebrate her 103rd birthday. Many family  members and friends will recognize this momentous occasion with a party in late November.  Maggie was born during President Theodore  Roosevelt’s second  term  in office and has  lived to see another 16 presidents in her lifetime. Maggie Brown was  the eleventh and  youngest child born to William (Doc) and Lucy  Callahan. She is the sister of Johnny (John S.)  Brown, Rosie May Brown, Pearlie Docia Ann  Brown  Seals,  Jasper  Brown,  Sally Mack  Brown Finch, Evie Brown Robinson, Lena  Jane Brown Jewell, Mary Lou Brown, Jewell  McNabb, Nora May Brown Barrow, Climmie  Lee Brown Finch Haynes and James Richard  (J.C.) Brown.  At a young age, Maggie united with  the  Mount Zion Baptist Church in Stephens, Georgia under  the  leadership of Reverend W.M.  Combs, and was baptized by Reverend Henry  Gresham. After church, she  loved  to play  baseball on Sunday afternoons with her siblings. She remained with Mt. Zion until she  moved to Atlanta, and still feels a connection  to her home church.  On November 30, 1940, she married Willie  (Dock) Kidd,  III, son of Willie Kidd,  II and  Annie Lou Dalton, and brother of Bernice Kidd  Wingfield, Ceola Kidd Jackson, Janie Kidd  Jackson and Carrie Kidd Thomas. Mr. and  Mrs. Kidd  raised  two  children,  John  and  Rosalyn. She is also a grandmother to four,  and a great-grandmother to three children. As  her husband and all siblings have passed  away, Maggie is the matriarch of her family.  Maggie still  takes  long vacation  trips with  her children and participates  in  family gatherings  and  activities  outside  of Georgia.  Maggie is an avid quilter and enjoys a quiet  afternoon stitching in her favorite chair.  In closing, Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life of  Mrs. Maggie Katie Brown Kidd, by wishing her  a very happy 103rd birthday.  f  LANTOS  RECOGNIZES  YAD  VASHEM  CEREMONY HONORING  ALBANIANS WHO SAVED JEWISH  LIVES DURING THE HOLOCAUST  HON. TOM LANTOS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 8, 2007  ",2007
2717,253,2007-11-08,Mr. LANTOS.," Madam Speaker, I would like  to call the attention of my colleagues in the  Congress to a ceremony that was held on November 1 at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs’ and Heroes Remembrance Authority  in  Jerusalem. This ceremony, which recognized  the unique role that Albanians played in saving every Jew who either lived in Albania or  sought asylum  there during World War  II,  marking  the opening of  ‘‘Besa: A Code of  Honor/Albanians who Rescued Jews during  the Holocaust.’’ This exhibit by Jewish American photographer Norman Gershman documents the heroism of the rescuers and their  families—65 percent of whom were Muslim—  who saved more  than 2,000 Jews  from  the  ravages of the Nazi Holocaust.  Few people are aware  that all Jews who  lived in Albania during World War II or sought  asylum  there were saved  from  likely death  during the Holocaust. Approximately 200 Jews  lived in Albania during the early 1930s, while  nearly 2000 Jews resided there by the end of  the war—making Albania the only nation that  can claim  that every Jew within  its borders  was rescued  from  the Holocaust. When  the  Italian  fascists  invaded Albania  in 1939,  followed by the German Nazis in 1943, the Albanian population hid Jews;  furthermore, Albanian government officials  refused  to comply  with the order to provide a list of Jews living  in Albania. While many Albanian citizens hid  Jews on their own initiative, the rescue operation became more coordinated as the danger  increased and ‘‘national liberation councils’’ in  towns where Jews were hiding moved them  from place  to place—either with  false passports or disguised as Albanian peasants. Albanians living in Kosova, Macedonia, and Montenegro,  then part of  the  former Yugoslavia,  were instrumental in gaining safe passage for  Jews into Albania.  Not only were the Albanians isolated from  centuries  of  institutionalized  anti-Semitism,  Madam Speaker, but they also have a history  of religious tolerance based on the Kanun (a  set of customary laws developed in the 15th  century and passed down through the generations).  Its underpinning moral code of besa,  which is celebrated in the Yad Vashem photo  exhibition, emphasizes a sacred promise  to  keep one’s word as well as to provide hospitality and protection.

2718,260,2007-11-08,Mr. LANTOS.," Madam Speaker, on November 20, Dr. Otto von Habsburg—a man of  courage and intellect and a great friend of the  United States—will celebrate his 95th birthday.  I extend  to him on  this occasion my very  warmest greetings. Although he and  I come  from  the most  different Central European  backgrounds  imaginable, we have become  friends over the years and I hold him in the  highest regard.  Dr. von Habsburg, who is in every way an  extraordinary human being, was born in 1912  into one of Europe’s oldest and most distinguished royal families. He is the eldest son of  Emperor Charles, the last Emperor of Austria  and the last King of Hungary and Bohemia,  and his wife, Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma.  Although he has renounced all claims to the  Austrian throne, Dr. von Habsburg retains the  hereditary titles of Archduke and Crown Prince  of Austria and Crown Prince of Hungary and  Bohemia.  Madam Speaker, I met Otto von Habsburg  shortly after I was elected a Member of the  Congress a quarter century ago. At that time,  I was  the chairman of  the U.S. delegation  which met twice a year with a delegation of  the European Parliament. At the time Otto was  a representative of Germany to the European  Parliament, and  the Ambassador of Austria  brought him to meet me in my office in the  Longworth Building. We both felt an immediate  bond, and have maintained a cordial relationship ever since.  We have met on numerous occasions  in  Brussels and Strasbourg, and we have met  frequently here in the United States when he  has visited our country. His son Gyorgy was  married in Budapest in 1997, and my wife Annette and I attended their wedding in the Basilica of St. Stephen. Just a few years ago on  his  last visit  to  the United States,  I was  pleased to welcome and pay tribute to Dr. von  Habsburg at a special meeting here  in  the  United States Capitol.  Madam  Speaker,  although  he  became  Crown Prince of Austria, Hungary and Bohemia when he was just 4 years old when his father became Emperor, and he continues  to  hold a number of impressive noble titles, what  truly distinguishes Otto von Habsburg  is not  who he was at birth, but who he became in  the course of his long and distinguished life.  After growing up as an exile in Switzerland  and Spain,  the young Otto studied  for his  Ph.D. in political science at Belgium’s famous  Catholic University of Louvain. As an astute  and principled conservative, he understood  early on the true nature of the Nazi movement  and became its staunch opponent.  While doing research in Berlin in the early  1930s  for his Ph.D. dissertation, Dr.  von  Habsburg was invited on two separate occasions to meet with Adolf Hitler, who for political reasons, sought to create the appearance  of an association between himself and the heir  to the Austrian and Hungarian thrones.  ‘‘I had  the great advantage of having already read Mein Kampf from start to finish and  knew what his plans were,’’ Dr. von Habsburg  later recalled. ‘‘All of this only reinforced my  refusal  to meet him. On  the other hand,  it  would have been an interesting experience. In  fact, this was the only interesting conversation  I ever avoided in my life.’’  In  the  immediate aftermath of  the  fall of  France to the Nazi armies, Dr. von Habsburg  worked with Aristide de Sousa Mendes,  the  Portuguese consul  in Bordeaux,  to secure  travel papers  for an estimated 20,000 Jews  and others  liable  to be persecuted by  the  Nazis. For his trouble, he was sentenced to  death by  the Nazis. Fortunately,  it was  in  absentia—Dr.  von Habsburg  had  escaped  from Europe in the nick of time and spent the  war years here in the United States.  After the war, he returned to Europe, where  he became a  leader of  the Paneuropean  Union, served for 20 years as a member of  the European Parliament and emerged as a  champion of human  rights. He was  famous  for, among many other things, ensuring that  there was always an empty chair inside the  Parliament building as a symbol of the European nations that were dominated at that time  by totalitarian and illiberal ideologies.  Dr. von Habsburg, who is the author of 27  books  in 7  languages,  is a passionate supporter  of  freedom  and  liberty  and  an  unblinking  opponent  of  racism  and  totalitarianism.  I salute him as he celebrates his  95th birthday, and I thank him for all the good  that he has done in this world.  f  TRIBUTE  TO  BHAVANI  K.D.

2719,260,2007-11-08,Mr. CRAMER.," Madam Speaker,  it  is with  great honor that I rise today to congratulate  my friend, Mrs. Bhavani Kakani of Huntsville,  Alabama, for receiving the 2007 Arthritis Foundation Humanitarian Award. This award  is  given annually  to a person  in  the Huntsville  community who has displayed exemplary community leadership.  Mrs. Kakani  is a distinguished community  advocate and civic volunteer who has given  countless hours to numerous community and  state-wide organizations and boards. In these  roles, she has led efforts to raise funds and  awareness  for health programs across our  State,  including ending child abuse and neglect, and inspiring self-worth and confidence  in young women. In addition, I have worked  directly with Mrs. Kakani  through her many  years of service on the National Children’s Advocacy Center’s board of directors.  Mrs. Kakani is the cofounder and president  of  the AshaKiran, a non-profit organization  dedicated to educating, empathizing, and empowering  foreign born  immigrants. Since  its  founding, AshaKiran has provided multilingual,  multicultural, and crisis referral services to numerous individuals in North Alabama.  Madam Speaker, in addition to her remarkable advocacy across the community, she has  worked with the Intergraph Corporation, as a  registered  cytologist  technician,  and  office  manager for her husband’s medical practice.  Mrs. Kakani  and  her  husband, Dr. Rao  Kakani, have also raised three children.  Madam Speaker, Bhavani Kakani’s leadership and her strong dedication to the community should serve as a model for others to follow. On behalf of  the people of North Alabama,  I congratulate Mrs. Kakani  for being  named the 2007 Arthritis Foundation Humanitarian Award Winner.  f  IN RECOGNITION OF JAMES  KLURFELD  HON. GARY L. ACKERMAN  OFNEWYORK  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 8, 2007  ",2007
2720,260,2007-11-08,Mr. ACKERMAN.," Madam Speaker,  I  rise  today  to pay  tribute  to James Klurfeld, vice  president  and  editorial  page  editor  of  Newsday, who last week retired after nearly  40 years of outstanding and tireless work at  the paper.  James Klurfeld was born  in 1945  in New  York City and is a 1963 graduate of Syosset  High School. His illustrious career at Newsday  began in 1968, just one year after he graduated from Syracuse University.  Klurfeld’s  first  job at Newsday was as a  local reporter, where he covered various news  stories on Long  Island. But he quickly rose  through the ranks at the paper, where his extraordinary reporting propelled him into several  key positions. He led Newsday’s Albany bureau, and he  served as  the newspaper’s  Washington bureau chief between 1980 and  1986. After his exceptional leadership during  these stints, Klurfeld was appointed editor of  the editorial pages in December 1987.  James Klurfeld’s constant pursuit of journalistic excellence has earned him numerous  honors and recognitions. He was a member of  the Newsday investigative team that won the  1970 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, as well  as the New York State Publisher’s Association  and Deadline Club award  in  the same category. The awards were  for a 3-year effort  that disclosed political corruption  in several  townships on Long  Island. He also won  the  Sigma Delta Chi National Reporting Award  with other members of the Washington bureau  in 1982, and he was the recipient of the 1988  American Society of Newspaper Editors Distinguished Writing Award  for editorials on  the  Iran-Contra hearings. In addition, the staff of  Newsday’s editorial and viewpoints pages won  several major awards under his  leadership.  These included everything from brilliantly written editorials  to exceptionally creative cartoons.  Over the years, Klurfeld has become incredibly knowledgeable about  local and national  issues and is an expert on foreign affairs matters, most notably through his extensive travels around the globe and from his work with  the Council on Foreign Relations. To this extent, he has provided Newsday readers with  VerDate Aug 31 2005  04:17 Nov 09, 2007 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\A08NO8.057 E08NOPT1 S K R A M E R M H h t i w 8 6 C P D O R P n o e r o o m h         ",2007

2723,3,2007-11-16,Mr.  LEVIN.," Mr.  President,  once  again the Senate has an opportunity to  address  the  situation  in  Iraq. This  morning, we are considering a motion  to proceed to H.R. 4156 that contains a  so-called bridge fund of $50 billion for  ongoing military operations in Iraq.  The House-passed bill provides  for  the President, within 30 days after enactment, to commence a phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq and  for the transition of those forces to  specific missions:  (1) protecting U.S.  diplomatic  facilities,  U.S.  forces,  American citizens; (2) conducting limited training, equipping and providing  logistical and intelligence support to  Iraqi Security Forces; and (3) engaging  in  targeted  counterterrorism  operations against al-Qaida, al Qaida affiliated groups, and other terrorist organizations in Iraq. It sets a goal for the  completion of the transition would be  December 15, 2008.  Some argue that we should not identify the new more limited missions or  commit  to  transition  to  them. The  President told the American people on  September 13 that we will transition to  a new phase starting in December and  that  ‘‘As this transition  in mission  takes place, our troops will focus on a  more  limited set of tasks,  including  counterterrorism operations and training, equipping, and  supporting  Iraqi  forces.’’ Does  that  sound  familiar?  Well, it’s like the House passed language before us.  It is the goal of completing the transition that he objects to—although it is  a goal and not binding. Setting a goal  may be too much for he who is unwilling to set a goal—but just don’t misrepresent it as a fixed timetable when  it is stated as a goal.  From all accounts, the surge has already produced militarily progress—  sectarian violence in most regions of  Iraq, particularly Baghdad, is down.  The problem is that, while the surge  has  at  this  point  seen militarily  progress, it has not accomplished its  primary  purpose  as  announced  by  President Bush last January, when he  stated that its purpose was to give the  Iraqi government ‘‘the breathing space  it needs to make progress in other critical areas.’’ The President also said  that ‘‘America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced.’’ Well we haven’t. The President statement that he ‘‘will hold the  Iraqi government to the benchmarks it  has announced’’  is  so much hollow  rhetoric. Those benchmarks include approving a hydrocarbon law; approving a  de-Baathification law; completing the  work of a Constitutional Review Committee; and holding provincial elections. Those commitments, made 11⁄2  years ago, which were to have been  completed by January 2007, have not  yet been kept by the Iraqi political  leaders despite the breathing space the  surge has provided. As a matter of fact,  the Iraqi leaders appear to be farther  apart today than they were at the start  of the surge. The Iraqi political leadership’s response to the breathing space  provided by the surge has been nothing  less than abysmal.  One year ago this month, the Prime  Minister of Iraq, Nouri al-Maliki himself: ‘‘The crisis is political, and the  ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of innocents are  the  [Iraqi] politicians.’’ Secretary of  Defense Gates agreed with that assessment in December of last year. President Bush agreed in January. Petraeus  agreed  in  September.  If  everyone  agrees that this is a political crisis,  why does the administration keep focusing on military solutions?  General Odierno, according to yesterday’s Washington Post, described the  breathing space as a window of opportunity, which may close at any time.  Whether the Iraqi political leaders decide to take advantage of this window  of opportunity is of course their decision. We can’t make that decision for  them. They are a sovereign country.  But how long U.S. forces remain deployed to Iraq, and with what missions,  and how long U.S. forces continue to  fight  the  insurgency  instead of  the  Iraqi army taking over that fight, and  how long we continue to subject our  brave  and  valiant  servicemen  and  women to the risk of death and serious  injury—those  decisions  are  in  our  hands.  Secretary Gates has said that pressure on the Iraqi political leaders is  useful. President Bush has acknowledged as much. How can Congress act  to put pressure on the Iraqi political  leaders? By setting a goal for the transition of the missions of U.S. forces in  Iraq to the more supporting and less direct  role. The Baker-Hamilton  Iraq  Study Group in their December 2006 report essentially called for a transition  of the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq  very much like that called for in this  bill—only they called  for  it to take  place by the first quarter of 2008.  We need to do more than say to the  Iraqis that our patience has run out  and that they need to seize the opportunity that has been given them. Their  dawdling will only end when they have  no choice.  The bill we will hopefully vote for  sets a goal for completion of a transition to missions the President has said  were going to transition to. I wish it  were binding but setting a timetable as  a goal  is better than silence which  leaves in place the open-endedness of  our current presence.  It  is that open-ended commitment  which continues to create in the minds  of the Iraqi political leaders the false  impression that their future is in our  hands instead of theirs.  We should vote for cloture on the  House passed bill and be allowed to  vote on its substance.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.  ",2007
2724,3,2007-11-16,Mr. CHAMBLISS.," Mr. President, this  morning we are going to be voting on  two supplemental appropriations bills.  Both of these bills would appropriate  funds for our operations in Iraq—one  would provide  $50 billion while  the  other would provide $70 billion. However, the key difference between the  bills is very simple: the goal of one of  the bills is to help our efforts in Iraq  succeed, and the goal of the other bill  is to make our efforts fail.  H.R. 4156, which passed the House of  Representatives on Wednesday by a  margin of only 15 votes, would mandate  that the  funds appropriated through  the bill can only be used for a ‘‘safe and  orderly’’ withdrawal  of U.S.  forces  from Iraq and requires that a withdrawal of U.S.  forces begin 30 days  after enactment with a goal for a complete withdraw of December 15, 2008. If  there is a reason the restrictions in  this bill sound familiar, it is because  they are. This bill employs the same  jargon and  ill-advised deadlines and  withdrawal dates  that  the majority  tried on the Defense authorization bill  and fiscal year 2007 supplemental appropriations  bill  earlier  this  year.  Those strategies failed and, in the case  of the appropriations bill, the proposed  restrictions were removed after a Presidential veto and Congress then passed  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:07 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S16NO7.REC S16NO7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007
2725,10,2007-11-16,Mr. SANDERS.," Mr. President, as we  consider the farm bill, I am proud to  say that Vermont is leading the Nation  in developing programs to bring fresh,  local foods to school cafeterias.  Let me begin by recounting the experience of Burlington, VT, which has  been  replicated  in other  cities and  towns across our State. Five years ago,  residents of the city expressed concern  about the significant nutritional issues  facing the city’s children. Twenty percent of the city’s children were living  in poverty, food insecurity was widespread, and the rate of childhood obesity was  steadily  increasing.  In  response, citizens called for an increased  commitment to healthy food choices  for children and their families.  At the same time, they were aware of  the need to promote the  local  farm  economy. So in the fall of 2003, with a  U.S. Department of Agriculture grant,  the Burlington School Food Project  was created.  The program brings fresh foods from  local  farms to school cafeterias and  provides  hands-on  agricultural  education in the classroom. Students at  the ten schools  in this program are  now eating foods that are healthier,  more nutritious and from all the reports I have heard, better tasting.  The program also involves students  in the process of harvesting, preparing  and even taste-testing their own food.  This  has  helped  many  young  Vermonters  learn about where  food  comes from, helping them connect with  their local farms and community.  After 4 years of the project’s existence,  the Burlington  school district  now prepares 930,000 meals annually  using fresh and local produce. Several  schools offer salad bars either as a full  lunch or as a side item to hot lunches.  This has led to better diets and improved health.  The project has also been impressive  from  an  economic  standpoint. Last  year,  for  instance, more  than  1,000  pounds of local tomatoes, 600 pounds of  local zucchini, 600 pounds of carrots  and 400 pounds of local basil were used  in school meals. The amount of local  produce purchased tripled between 2003  and 2006.  Many partners have built upon these  successes. Today, I would like to mention two driving forces.  Bonnie Acker, a school parent, took  it upon herself to do whatever necessary to improve the quality of the  food being served at her child’s school.  She worked with teachers, students,  volunteers, and cafeteria workers at  Edmunds Middle School. This school  has become a model for others, its cafeteria has been transformed, and  its  school gardens are rich with color.  The  director  of  the  Burlington  School Food Service, Doug Davis, provided much of the leadership needed to  make BSFP work. When he was approached by parents like Bonnie, he listened. He then immediately took action and spearheaded an effort to buy  whole grain breads for the cafeterias.  Doug also introduced initiatives such  as taste tests and classrooms linked to  the cafeteria. Before long, Burlington  students were trying new  foods and  getting healthier lunches. For his efforts, Doug was presented the Northeast award as Food Service Director of  the Year.  But Burlington is not alone. Other  Vermont school districts have undertaken similar programs, among them:  Brattleboro  Elementary  Schools,  which won a Vermont Farm to School  grant to set up a program to promote  local  food purchasing,  taste  testing  seasonal foods, and to get students to  farms for hands-on agricultural experiences. Sheila Humphreys coordinates  the program, and Laura White has been  a major force in its success.  Waitsfield Elementary worked with  VT FEED on local purchasing and developing a  food,  farm and nutrition  curriculum. Key figures in this effort  have been school nurse Sue Dillon, as  well as George Schenk of American  Flatbread, who has been a strong and  supportive community member raising  money for Waitsfield and other schools.  Orleans  Essex  North  Supervisory  Union, where three elementary schools  have  comprehensive  farm  to  school  programs  that  include  local  purchasing, school gardening, taste testing of seasonal products, harvest celebrations with farmers and the communities, field studies with students on  farms, and the development of  farm  and food-based classroom activities.  Sharon  Elementary  School  also  worked with VT FEED for 3 years developing a  food,  farm, and nutrition  curriculum.  Its  principal,  Sheila  Moran,  along with  teacher Keenan  Haley and food service director Lynn  Ann Perry, have been instrumental in  weaving  farm  to  school  into  their  school culture.  Ferrisburgh Elementary School has  involved high school students to do  field studies on farms, make a school  garden, purchase more local foods and  taste-test them, try new recipes using  local foods, and have a farmers’ market  harvest festival for their community.  In addition, Hardwick Elementary  School has worked with VT FEED on  combining  food,  farm, and nutrition  into the existing curricula, planting  crops on farms for school use, and making healthy snacks. Val Simmons, its  food service director, has led the effort  to reconnect students and school food  to the local farms.  Salisbury Elementary School takes  students to local farms for field studies  and does  local  food taste testing  in  classrooms.  Here,  teacher  Diane  Benware and food service director Gaye  Truax have been prime movers.  On a larger scale, the Food Works’  Farm-to-Table  program,  based  in  Montpelier, serves as a nonprofit distributor of produce from 18 area farms,  delivering the produce throughout the  year to 13 schools in central Vermont.  In 2007 alone, more than $50,000 of local  produce has been purchased and distributed through Farm-to-Table. Rick  Hungerford, food service director at the  U-32 High School in East Montpelier, is  now sourcing nearly 14 percent of cafeteria purchases locally while turning a  profit  and  preparing  outstanding,  healthy food for the entire school community. Ann Gilbert and Liz Scharf,  two parents from Rumney Elementary  School  in Middlesex,  spearheaded a  grassroots  effort  to  connect  their  school with local farms, in particular  to  purchase  year-round  from  local  grower Joe Buley, who is new to farming and has invested in greenhouse production so he can sell to schools.  Finally,  let me recognize Vermont  Food Education Every Day, VT FEED,  which  uses  a  community-based  approach to school food system change  and is the product of a collaboration of  three Vermont nonprofits: Food Works,  Northeast Organic Farming Association of VT, and Shelburne Farms. It  does fine work in building connections  between classrooms, cafeterias,  local  farms, and communities.  It  is most  ably directed by Abbie Nelson and Kim  Norris. It has also had strong cooperation from Jo Busha, the State Director  of the Vermont Department of Education Child Nutrition Program, in introducing the farm to school concept  to many school food service directors.  And this is just the beginning. With  strong provisions in the farm bill for  beginning  farmers,  increased  funding  for fruits and vegetables for schools,  and an  innovative pilot to work on  community  gardens  in high-poverty  schools,  I  expect Vermont’s  trailblazing efforts to expand not only in  our State, but across the Nation.

2726,10,2007-11-16,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I will oppose the motion to proceed to both the  Senate  and House  bills  to  provide  bridge funding to Iraq because they do  not contain firm and enforceable dates  to get our troops out of Iraq.  Once again, Congress is being asked  to pour tens of billions of dollars more  into an unending war,  for uncertain  goals, carried forward by little more  than a mixture of blind faith and inertia.  Once again, the American people are  being asked to shut their eyes tight  against the  facts and trudge blindly  on—this time at the cost of some $50 or  $70 billion, depending on which bill we  are talking about, and who knows how  many more  lives. And  once  again,  those who question this war—a majority of Americans—are being asked: You  support the troops, don’t you?  How could we not? How could we not  be awed by the bravery and sacrifice of  our men and women in Iraq? How could  we not be inspired by their choice to  volunteer in the first place? How could  we not be impressed by the discipline,  competence, intelligence, and resourcefulness with which General Petraeus  and the soldiers under his command  have fought in Iraq? They deserve our  respect and much more.

2727,17,2007-11-16,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, with all the  ‘‘he said, she said’’ that has been going  on in this body this week, everyone  should all agree with one voice we  passed  extremely  important  legislation, terrorism insurance, which gives  breathing room to the American free  enterprise system, which allows various companies  to go  forward with  what needs to be done, dealing with  making sure that when they have a  building they are going to construct,  that there is some ability for the purchase of insurance, so if something untoward comes from these evil people  around the world, they are covered.  This is good legislation. I appreciate  the cooperation of the Republicans.  ",2007
2728,17,2007-11-16,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate has  unanimously  passed  the  Terrorism  Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. It is critically important for our Nation’s workers and businesses that we enact this backstop legislation. The legislation passed today  provides for an extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, known as  ‘‘TRIA,’’ which expires on December 31  of  this  year. TRIA was  originally  passed in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and was extended for 2 years in  2005. The bill passed by the Senate  today extends TRIA for an additional 7  years.  In anticipation of TRIA’s expiration,  the Banking Committee held a hearing  earlier this year  in which the committee heard from a variety of experts  about the critical need to extend this  program, which  is vital to the economic security and prosperity of our  Nation. As my colleagues will recall,  after the attacks of September 11, 2001,  the market for terrorism insurance in  this  country  virtually  disappeared.  Businesses could not obtain credit, borrowers could not obtain  loans,  jobs  were at risk, and the economy faced serious  instability and dislocation. We  repeatedly heard from businesses, both  large and small,  from  labor unions,  from universities and hospitals, from  manufacturers, builders, and  lenders,  and from insurers about the need for  the Federal Government to help stabilize the market and ensure the availability of affordable insurance against  the risk of  future terrorist attacks.  Congress responded by creating TRIA,  a public-private partnership in which  the Federal Government would share  the  risk of  future  terrorist attacks  with insurers by becoming the backstop against truly catastrophic losses.  And  the  overwhelming  evidence  shows that TRIA has worked, very very  well. According to several recent studies, terrorism insurance is more widely  available and more affordable today  than in the aftermath of 9/11, providing  certainty and stability to the sectors  of our economy that we depend on for  our national well-being. And it is important to note, TRIA has cost taxpayers virtually nothing. When  terrorism insurance is available at reasonable rates, and when business owners  and property owners can insure themselves against terrorism, there is a private-sector mechanism  in  place  to  cover  a  significant  amount  of  the  losses stemming from any future terrorist attack. In fact, a recent study by  the RAND Corporation found that in  the case of a terrorist attack, TRIA  would actually save taxpayers money,  as property owners could rebuild using  the  payments  from  their  insurance  policies instead of federal disaster assistance. Let me quote from RAND’s  findings: ‘‘Taxpayer cost is lower with  TRIA  than without TRIA across a  broad range of scenarios when post-attack assistance is factored in as well.’’  The need to extend this program is  clear. The private insurance industry  has not reemerged with respect to the  provision of terrorism insurance. Nearly all of the data and the experts say  that there is no reason to think that  the private  insurance  industry alone  can insure against this unique risk. As  long as the threat of terrorism remains, we must act to ensure that terrorism insurance remains available and  affordable.  I want to note that this bill contains  two important studies to address serious issues that were raised in the context of  the TRIA extension debate.  First, there is a mandate for the GAO  to study the question of insurance for  nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological  terrorist  events.  Insurance  coverage in this area is very limited  and in this legislation we require the  GAO to make recommendations for expanding  such  coverage. Second,  the  GAO is required to study and to report  back to the committee within 6 months  on whether  there are areas of  this  country,  such as Lower Manhattan,  that may have unique capacity constraints when it comes to terrorism insurance, and  to make  recommendations  for  addressing  those  capacity  constraints.  This legislation is supported by the  insurance industry and policyholders,  and I ask unanimous consent to have  printed in the RECORD letters of support for the legislation. I also want to  particularly thank Senator SHELBY for  his work on this program, as well as  Majority Leader REID, Minority Leader  MCCONNELL, and Senators REED, BENfor  their work  both on this bill and on the original  TRIA bill and its extension in 2005. By  extending the TRIA program for an additional 7 years, this bill will address  the  long-term security needs of our  people and our economy, and I thank  all the Members of the Senate for their  unanimous support for this legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  NETT, and SCHUMER,  INTERNATIONALBROTHERHOODOF  TEAMSTERS,  Washington, DC, October 16, 2007.  Hon. CHRISTOPHERDODD,  Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and  Urban Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.  DEARMR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing to encourage prompt action on the matter of terrorism risk insurance. For us and our families, it is an issue of jobs and our national  economic security, as well as one of protecting  the  investments of pensioners  to  shareholders to individuals.  With the devastation of the September  11th attacks, and the recognition that terrorism risk will be with us for the foreseeable future, insurers have excluded this risk  from  coverage,  and  reinsurance  remains  largely unavailable, exposing our economic  security to serious peril.  The essential facts that led Congress to  enact the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of  2002 have not changed. We continue to face  an unpredictable threat with the potential of  mammoth losses to our economy. We continue to need terrorism insurance for our  economy to function in the face of the terrorist threat. We continue to need the framework the program provides to enable the  United States to recover quickly and efficiently should there be some future terrorist  attack.  As Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I encourage you to act on an effective long-term federal program as soon as  possible.  Thank you for your consideration of these  views.  Sincerely.  FREDERICKP. MCLUCKIE,  Legislative Director,  Government Affairs Department.  COALITIONTOINSURE  AGAINSTTERRORISM,  Washington, DC, October 16, 2007.  Hon. CHRISTOPHERJ. DODD, Chairman,  Hon. RICHARDC. SHELBY, Ranking Member,  Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and  Urban Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.  DEARCHAIRMANDODDANDRANKINGMEMBERSHELBY: The Coalition to Insure Against  Terrorism (CIAT), a broad-based coalition of  business  insurance  policyholders,  representing a significant segment of the nation’s GDP, strongly endorses your efforts to  extend and improve the Terrorism Risk insurance Act (TRIA) with the introduction of  the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA).  CIAT is very pleased that the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs is proposing bi-partisan legislation to  extend TRIA. As the principal consumers of  this vital insurance coverage, CIAT thanks  you for your long-standing support and leadership on the issue of terrorism risk insurance.  The current federal terrorism risk insurance program has been a tremendous success. TRIA has helped keep the economy  going  in  the  face of continued  terrorist  threats by allowing businesses across America to secure this commercially necessary  product, saving countless jobs in the process.  Moreover, it serves as an important tool to  minimize  the  severe economic disruption  that almost certainly will occur from a future terrorist attack.  With TRIEA’s expiration looming at the  end of 2007, CIAT is extremely pleased that  the extension enjoys bi-partisan support in  the Committee, and we look forward to the  Committee’s consideration of it.  CIAT thanks you for taking a significant  step towards securing the economy against  terrorism risk by scheduling this mark-up.

I thank the  Chair. I thank the Senator. I thank all  of the Senators. I thank all the Members and the staff who make it possible  for us to do our work. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you.

2730,24,2007-11-16,Mr. BROWN.," Mr. President, today  the Senate will break for the Thanksgiving holiday. We will all travel back  to our States. We will work in our offices. We will move around our States.  We will probably celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday with our families and  our friends.  Many of us who are so very blessed  will gather together next Thursday at  tables surrounded by family, echoing  with laughter, overflowing with food.  For too many families in my home  State of Ohio and across the Nation  next Thursday will be very different.  These families, many of whom work  full-time, simply do not earn enough  each month to survive without the assistance of food stamps and food banks  and help from churches and help from  other organizations.  Too many  families  suffering  from  layoffs—layoffs caused by plant closings, the offshoring of jobs, and the  downsizing of American industry—are  now solely reliant on food stamps and  food banks to feed their families. Adding anguish to heartache, food banks,  the last hope many have for getting  even just one meal a day, are finding  themselves running short on food.  Yesterday’s Cincinnati Enquirer told  the story of Denise Arnold, a mother  from Roselawn, OH, a suburb of Cincinnati. Since losing her job, and while  looking for another job, Ms. Arnold has  fallen behind on her rent and worries  about becoming homeless. She has applied for food stamps, but that process  takes time, and she has a son to feed.  Ms. Arnold visits the St. Vincent de  Paul food pantry industry to get what  food she can for her family. She told  the reporter: It is really rough. I have  been so scared. The pantry once was  able to offer a week’s supply of food to  those in need. Now, because of budget  cuts and inadequate funding, this pantry must ration out, as so many others  do, to their visitors, a few days’ worth  at a time, not a full week.  According to yesterday’s newspaper  article, food pantries across the region  have similar stories to report. On this  floor,  I  have  shared  the  story  of  Rhonda Stewart, a single mother from  Butler County, OH, who relies on food  stamps to feed her family.  Ms. Stewart bravely shared her story  before  the Senate Agriculture Committee several months ago as we began  the process of writing the 2007 farm  bill. She told us she has a young son  and  is  fairly recently divorced. Her  husband—her ex-husband—has lost his  job and is not able to support the son  or his former wife.  She has a full-time job, only making  about $9 an hour. She is president of  the local PTA and volunteers for the  Cub  Scouts.  She  teaches  Sunday  school. She does everything we ask of a  citizen and a parent, and she is a food  stamp beneficiary.  Yet, she told us, at the beginning of  the month, she and her son—she cooks  pork chops once or twice that  first  week. That is his favorite meal. By the  middle of the month, she takes him out  to a fast food restaurant perhaps once  or twice. By the end of the month, she  always runs out of money. She sits at  the dining room or the kitchen table  with her son, and that last couple of  days of the month at dinnertime he is  eating dinner, and she is sitting there  not eating.  He says: Mom, what is wrong?  She says: I am not feeling well, or I  am not hungry. She said it happens  month after month.  The truth is, food stamps provide a  benefit of about $1 per person per meal.  So Rhonda Stewart was getting $6 per  day for food stamps. She traveled to  Washington  to  let  us  know what  mattered most to her and to her family  and to families like hers. She had every  right to expect that we would listen  and we would hear her.  In 2006, more than 35 million Americans went hungry. We must ask ourselves, how many more will go hungry  next Thursday and Friday and Saturday and Sunday and into the rest of the  holiday season?  I raise this issue today because at  this moment we are debating in this  Chamber  legislation  that  literally  means the difference between food and  hunger for Ms. Arnold, Ms. Stewart,  and millions of families in this country, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of families in my home State of  Ohio like theirs.  In a nation wealthy as ours, eradicating hunger, eliminating poverty, investing in families should not be a political  issue.  It  is  not Republican  versus Democrat. It is food and shelter  versus Americans who aren’t as fortunate as all of us in this body, as the  staff, the Senators, all of us. This is a  moral obligation, a duty that  flows  from compassion and the very reason  we have been sent here as public servants.  In November of last year, families in  my State of Ohio, as they did in the  State of the Presiding Officer, sent a  loud and clear message that they wanted change. They demanded in no uncertain terms that the priorities championed here in Washington better reflect their own back home. Given their  call for change and the unquestionable  understanding  of  challenges  facing  families across the country, one must  pause and reflect on what we are actually doing here. We have a responsibility  to  think about  the priorities  being debated this week, this very day  as part of the farm bill.  On the one hand, we have been arguing for weeks about how many tens of  millions, sometimes hundreds of millions, an industry gets out of this bill.  We have been arguing over profit margins. On the other hand, we have in  this  legislation  language that would  fund food banks by an additional $110  million each year. We have legislation  that would increase food stamp funding  by $5 billion over 5 years and would  help millions of new families with food  assistance. We have the opportunity in  this bill to validate for Ms. Arnold and  Ms. Stewart and the millions of mothers like them across the country that  their voices do in fact matter. These  are not  issues being discussed only  within these walls. This is a question  of principle. It is a call to action the  public understands very well. The public understands how important are the  issues of hunger, social justice, investing in families, at every level of income.  I applaud Ohio food banks and businesses such as First Energy and the  Kroger Company for their dedication  and initiative. This year First Energy  and its employees, as part of their Harvest  for Hunger campaign, collected  the  equivalent  of nearly  2 million  meals. This week the Kroger Company  helped jump-start a Hunger is Unacceptable  campaign  in  greater  Cincinnati.  Local social service agencies in the  area are pooling resources to help fight  hunger more effectively. What these  stories say to me is that people back  home get it. They get it in Cincinnati,  in Columbus, and in Cleveland. It is  time that Washington gets it.  I strongly urge my colleagues to remember  that budgets and bills are  more than ink on paper. They are a set  of priorities, and they are about our  values. I strongly encourage my colleagues not to delay  in passing the  farm bill and to remember how many  families are depending on them for us  to stand up for them.  I fully expect and encourage families  back home to continue watching what  we do and to hold all of us accountable  for our actions.  I want to say to Ms. Arnold—with a  very special mention to Rhonda Stewart—that so many of us in this Chamber hear you. We are fighting for you,  and we will not give up.  I yield the floor.

2736,31,2007-11-16,Mr. SESSIONS.," Mr. President, we are  facing a number of challenges in the  Senate and in the Congress, but none is  more important than our willingness  and our responsibility to properly support the men and women in our Armed  Forces who are serving us today in Iraq  and Afghanistan; serving us because we  voted to send them there, doing the  policy of the United States that has  the support of the President, the Chief  Executive, the Commander  in Chief,  and that has been supported by the  Congress.  Yes, we have had a lot of debate, a  lot of dissension, and a  lot of complaints, but when the chips have been  down, time and time again we have authorized and funded the activities that  are going on now in the name of the  United States of America in Iraq and in  Afghanistan.  We had an election last fall. We have  heard people talk about that. But the  American people did not say: We want  to pull out of Iraq regardless of the  consequences. They said they were not  happy, and none of us were happy with  the way things were going.  It seemed to be drifting in a bad way,  and there seemed to be no positive results coming. So we had, after this  election, last spring, April and May, a  big debate about  it. And President  Bush said: We need to change policy. I  am going to send a new general over  there, General Petraeus, and we are  going to change tactics, and I am going  to  ask  you  to  approve  additional  troops.  I am asking  for a surge  in  troops.  So we talked about it. We debated it  right here in the Senate. This great  Nation’s legislative branch responded  to the President’s call and had a debate  on it. We had no obligation to fund  that. None whatsoever. But earlier in  the summer, we voted 80 to 14 to fund  the surge in Iraq and to send General  Petraeus and to give him a chance to  utilize a new tactic and a new strategy  for confronting the terrorist forces we  were  facing  there,  in particular al-  Qaida, which was a strong entity at  that time.  I have got to tell you, I was worried  things had not gone as well as we had  expected. We had had a bad year, and  casualties were up and attacks were up  and it was a tough time. But as part of  that debate, we asked General Petraeus  to come back in September and give us  a  report. My Democratic colleagues  and others, all of us were concerned.  We wanted a report to see how things  were going because we were not going  to have a blank check and unended obligation  to  Iraq  if  things were not  going to work.  That is a fundamental synopsis of the  situation. I believe that is a fair analysis. So General Petraeus came back  and gave us his report. General Jimmy  Jones had been sent and a group of  other independent evaluators with experience in military matters.  That commission was sent over there  at the direction of Congress. When we  passed the supplemental to fund General Petraeus and the surge, we required another report, not just General  Petraeus, but the Jones Commission to  come back and make a  report. We  asked the General Accounting Office to  do an evaluation also, the independent  GAO.  So they all came back in September.  We had hearings and debate and suggestions and we continued to go forward. We voted, in essence, to continue  to allow General Petraeus to pursue  the plans he was carrying out. Some  progress had been made. It was notable, but it was not sufficient for us to  say with certainty that a major change  positively had occurred. We could not  be certain of that. But it looked as if  some progress was being made with  more troops and new tactics.  So we said then: Let’s go forward.  And we did. Now we have seen some  very dramatic positive developments in  Iraq. The Iraqi people, by all accounts,  I think few can dispute this, have believed the American troops are reliable  allies. We have changed our tactics in  how we deal with the local Iraqi officials and tribal leaders and mayors and  chiefs of police.  We are doing a much better job—General Petraeus  is—of partnering with  them. They have turned against al-  Qaida, Osama bin Laden’s troops, that  terrorist group they thought was going  to take over Iraq. And Al Anbar, the  worst area  in Iraq  for al-Qaida, has  made a transformation. Al-Qaida is on  the run throughout Iraq. Violence is  down substantially.  Can I guarantee you it will continue  to go down? I cannot. I can tell you  that deaths of American soldiers are  down by two-thirds this last month;  and attacks on Iraqi civilians, which  always cost more lives than attacks on  our American soldiers, are down by a  similar margin. Attacks on Iraqi soldiers are also down.  Al-Qaida has virtually been removed.

2737,38,2007-11-16,Mr. BIDEN.," Mr. President, I wish to  commend a true leader, someone who  has  left an  indelible  impression on  thousands of Delaware’s college students. Dr. Scott D. Miller, after 10  years at the helm of Wesley College in  Dover, is moving on to the next phase  in his professional life.  Dr. Miller’s  tenure at Wesley has  been marked by previously unknown  success. He took over a quiet school in  our State capital and turned it into a  nationally recognized institution with  a burgeoning and diverse student population.  Evidence of his quick influence is the  fact that Wesley was named as one of  just four ‘‘amazing turnarounds’’ featured in the book, ‘‘The Small College  Guide to Financial Health,’’ after only  5 years of Dr. Miller at the helm.  Dr. Miller’s accomplishments are too  numerous to name in one statement,  but I would like to mention a few of  the most notable:  Wesley’s faculty is stronger in number and  diversity, which has improved the retention  rate and academic profile of Wesley’s student body.  Enrollment has nearly tripled in the 10  years Dr. Miller has been president.  He has presided over the most prolific  fundraising era in Wesley’s history.  And he has developed community service  partnerships for his students with five campus-based affiliates.  In short, Wesley College has been  changed permanently—and for the better—by Dr. Miller’s leadership and vision. My State’s oldest private college  will retain its prominence for years to  come, thanks to Dr. Miller’s guidance  in leading that institution into the 21st  century.

2738,38,2007-11-16,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President,  I  would like to recognize Kitty L. Roberts, the superintendent of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, who  will retire on December 3, 2007, after 28  years with the National Park Service.  Currently the superintendent of Glen  Canyon National Recreation Area and  Rainbow Bridge National Monument,  for many years Kitty headed the National Park Service’s Office of Legislative and Congressional Affairs, where  she worked very closely with the Energy  and Natural Resources  Committee.  A native of Milton, WV, Kitty graduated from the University of Maryland  and attended graduate school at Indiana University. She then worked for  the Maryland National Capital Park  and Planning Commission, where she  remained for 9 years.  Kitty began her career with the National Park Service in 1979 as a management assistant in the National Capital Region. She went on to become the  assistant superintendent at the George  Washington Memorial Parkway  between 1980 and 1984. From 1984 to 1990,  Kitty was the Deputy Associate Regional Director, White House Liaison,  in the National Capital Region. During  this time, Kitty was the NPS Inaugural  coordinator and oversaw the development of East Executive Park that now  serves as a visitor entrance  to  the  White House. In 1990, Kitty returned to  the  George  Washington  Memorial  Parkway, where she served as superintendent.  In  1993,  former National  Park Service Director Roger Kennedy  asked Kitty to become the assistant director  for Legislative  and Congressional Affairs. Kitty served in that position for 8 years, and during that time  was  extremely helpful  to  the  committee in its consideration of national  park-related legislation.  During Kitty’s tenure as assistant director, over 230 laws were passed affecting our national parks. Among the notable laws passed during that period  were the California Desert Protection  Act and the Omnibus Parks and Public  Lands Management Act of 1996, with  its creation of 5 new park units, 10 new  national heritage areas, 12 park boundary adjustments, and numerous other  changes that benefited several units of  the National Park System. Kitty also  worked on the Transportation Equity  Act for the 21st Century, which doubled  the amount of  funding  for national  park roads, and the National Parks  Omnibus Management Act  of  1998,  which  reformed  the National Park  Service’s concessions program, created  a park  research mandate, and  supported employee career development  and training.  In February 2001, Kitty  left Washington to become the superintendent of  Glen Canyon National Recreation Area  and Rainbow Bridge National Monument. During her time at the park,  Kitty has worked on a policy for personal watercraft and off-highway vehicle use. She has found ways to maintain access to Lake Powell even as ongoing drought conditions have led to a  145–foot drop in the lake’s water level.  Perhaps one of her most  important  contributions has been a program of  public education to prevent needless  deaths due to individuals swimming behind boats where exhaust fumes were  vented.  In early June of this year,  Kitty presided with the President of  the Navajo Nation at the grand opening of the new floating marina village  at Antelope Point, with its architectural elements from the surrounding  red rock landscape and its unique cooling system using lake water from 75  feet below the surface.  Kitty has had a distinguished career  with the National Park Service and  will be greatly missed by those she has  worked with over the years, both in the  Park Service and in Congress. I want  to congratulate Kitty on her retirement and thank her for the many contributions she has made toward making our national parks the pride of our  Nation, and I wish her the best in the  years ahead.∑  f  TRIBUTE TO JERRY PARKS  ∑",2007
2739,38,2007-11-16,Mr. BUNNING.," Mr. President, today I  pay tribute to Jerry Parks of Georgetown, KY, for being recognized on USA  Today’s 2007 All-USA Teacher Team.  For 10 years USA Today has selected  K–12 teachers nationwide for the All-  USA Teacher Team. This year  the  nominees were judged on how well they  recognize and respond to the needs of  their students as well as the effectiveness of their teaching methods. Each  team member demonstrates dedication  and  enthusiasm  for  educating  the  youth and future of this great country.  Mr. Parks, a  seventh-grade  social  studies teacher at Georgetown Middle  School, was recognized in the top 8 of  20 teachers on this national team. His  creative hands-on teaching techniques  produce students who value education  and are eager to learn more. Mr. Parks  also holds a doctorate in theology and  has had several teacher guides published. Because of his commitment to  education, Mr. Parks established student scholarships with the profits from  these  publications. His  passion  for  teaching serves as an inspiration to his  peers and to teachers everywhere.  I now ask my fellow colleagues to  join me in congratulating Mr. Parks  for his remarkable achievement and  his devotion to educating young minds.

2741,45,2007-11-16,Mr. DURBIN.," Mr. President, we are  all aware of the current healthcare crisis in our nation. Health care spending  continues to rise at an unsustainable  rate, constituting  16 percent of  the  Federal budget. Health care costs have  increased 78 percent since 2001, more  than 4 times the pace of prices and  wages.  One reason for the rise in costs and  spending is the increase in chronic disease. Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are the leading causes of death and  disability  in the U.S. They also account for 70 percent of all deaths in the  U.S., or 1.7 million people each year.  These diseases also make life harder  for the 1 of 10 Americans who are living  with them. The irony, of course, is that  chronic diseases are both preventable  and manageable.  The quality of our healthcare has not  changed substantially despite the fact  that we live in the wealthiest country  in the world with the best researchers  and medical doctors at our fingertips.  At a time when both health care costs  and chronic illnesses are on the rise,  we need a better way to provide care.  Changing the delivery of care is a  controversial topic, but it is a topic  that has gained more traction in recent  months. Last week,  the New York  Times published an article titled, ‘‘A  Model for Health Care That Pays for  Quality.’’ The article described a new  model for healthcare, and I quote here,  ‘‘to identify the best primary care doctors and to steer patients their way.  Those doctors, in turn, would be paid  for more services than are currently reimbursed under  typical health plan  payments for office visits. The idea is  to encourage doctors to meet with patients for more than a few minutes during an office visit and to also compensate them, or nurse coordinators,  for communicating with patients by  phone and e-mail outside office hours.’’  This is an approach to delivering care  that national physician groups and patient advocacy organizations call the  medical home.  A medical home is something that  those of us who have it take for granted. We see the same doctor, in the same  setting, for extended periods of time.  Our medical history is in one place,  and even if we are seeing specialists or  different doctors in the same practice,  there is continuity in decisions about  our health care. This  is a medical  home.  But many people do not have this  luxury. Think about people who move  from place to place, whose home lives  are less than stable, who don’t have  health insurance, whose medical care is  sporadic. For these members of our  community, each visit to a clinic or an  emergency room means starting over  again.  So, everyone should have access to a  medical home. A medical home is not  only a place, but an approach to providing  comprehensive  primary  care  that respects, and responds to,  individual patient preferences and needs  and helps patients develop  relationships with their providers.  It sounds easy, but it requires some  changes and creative thinking and, perhaps most importantly, it requires a  commitment  by  local  providers  to  work  together. The medical  home  model makes  sense  for  improving  health care for everyone. It is a model  of care that makes sense for stretching  our limited Federal health care dollars.  States like Illinois and North Carolina are already seeing progress with  implementing the medical home model.  Illinois Health Connect is a new program at  the  Illinois Department of  Healthcare and Family Services that  uses the medical home model to deliver  primary and preventive care for children and adults covered through the  All Kids program. This emphasis on coordinated and ongoing care is leading  to better health outcomes, and it’s saving money.  Community Care of North Carolina  launched a medical home model in 1998,  through nine physician-led networks.  North Carolina  started  by  creating  medical homes for 250,000 Medicaid enrollees. Today, it is a State-wide program that has saved the state at least  $60 million in Medicaid costs in 2003  and $120 million in 2004.

2742,52,2007-11-16,Mr. SALAZAR.," Mr. President, today  I am introducing the Fountain Creek  Feasibility Study Act of 2007. This bill  is an important piece of a larger vision  to transform and restore the Fountain  Creek watershed, which lies in the Arkansas River Valley between the cities  of Pueblo and Colorado Springs in my  State of Colorado.  The Fountain Creek watershed is a  major tributary to the Arkansas River  and is home to a wide variety of plants  and wildlife. Anyone who has traveled  the  1–25  corridor  between Colorado  Springs and Pueblo can attest to the  natural beauty of this region. The watershed  itself  comprises  927  square  miles, but the impact of its waterflow  extends  far beyond  its strict boundaries. According to the 2000 census,  more than 500,000 people live in the watershed’s boundaries. Water from the  watershed serves municipal, industrial  and agricultural uses. Creeks within  the watershed contribute about 15 percent of the drinking water for Colorado  Springs and are a source of irrigation  for over 100 farms and ranches. The fertile  farmland  there produces wheat,  com, hay, oats, and vegetable crops;  there are also many working livestock  ranches along Fountain Creek.  Today there are major problems with  Fountain Creek. In recent years, instead of serving as an important link  for  commerce  and  recreation,  the  Fountain has divided the area. Decades  of neglect, increased waterflows in the  Fountain as a result of major urban development in the north half of the watershed,  increased  stormwater  discharges, and  sewage  spills have all  harmed the region. The watershed is  subject to frequent flood damage, erosion,  and  sedimentation.  In  1999  a  major flood caused millions of dollars  of damage to public and private property, and destroyed the foundations of  numerous homes and  roads.  Indeed,  just this spring there was minor flooding from the Fountain in the Pueblo  area. Farmers and ranchers near the  downstream end of the watershed in  particular  have  suffered  substantial  losses of productive farmland. Degradation of the water quality and thus  aquatic and wetland habitats is accelerating due to wastewater spills, loss of  natural vegetation, and high water volume. Simply put, Fountain Creek watershed’s ecological conditions are unstable and under constant threat.  This bill is a foundation stone for the  idea of restoring Fountain Creek and  turning the corridor between Colorado  Springs and Pueblo into an environmental, agricultural, and recreational  ‘‘crown jewel’’ for my State.  This bill would task the Army Corps  of Engineers to conduct a study of the  feasibility of constructing one or more  dams and reservoirs to provide more  reliable flood and sediment control, to  conserve fish and wildlife and preserve  their ecosystem, and to improve the  water quality throughout the watershed. The Corps’ expertise and experience will be critical to determining the  options  for restoring the health and  stability of the Fountain Creek watershed.  The  idea  of  such  a multipurpose  project on the Fountain is not new. It  was first proposed in 1970 by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers after the 1965  flood  that  inundated  communities  along the Fountain Creek,  including  particularly the city of Pueblo. The  proposal was supported by the States  of Colorado and Kansas and local officials, and was even the preferred option  of the Army Corps for addressing flooding in the Fountain. I believe a similar  proposal should be evaluated again, in  light of changed conditions and  increased flows in Fountain Creek resulting from urban development in the Colorado Springs metro area. Because the  Fountain  contributes  a  significant  amount of water to the Arkansas River  Valley below  the confluence of  the  Fountain Creek and Arkansas River in  Pueblo, this project may very well help  address the various concerns of residents and communities of the Arkansas  River Valley from Pueblo to the Kansas State line.  Last year I laid out a vision to revitalize Fountain Creek and connect the  communities along its bank in a regional project. My plan involves the  cleanup and revitalization of Fountain  Creek; creating a  linear  state park  along the river corridor with camping  facilities, hundreds of miles of new  trails,  restored wildlife and natural  habitat and new flat water recreation  opportunities;  protecting  farms  and  ranches along the creek and  in the  lower Arkansas Valley; and ensuring a  greenbelt separator between the communities of Colorado Springs and Pueblo.  My vision is to restore and transform  this vital watershed. I hope that all  levels of Government can work  together to bring unmatched recreational  opportunities, create an environment  for plants and wildlife to flourish, ensure  that agricultural  lands  remain  productive, and address the flood control and water quality issues on Fountain Creek. This bill  is an essential  step towards achieving this goal.  By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself  and Mrs. BOXER):  S. 2386. A bill to amend the Robert T.  Stafford Disaster Relief  and Emergency Assistance Act,  to  authorize  temporary mortgage and rental payments; to the Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs.  ",2007
2743,52,2007-11-16,Mrs. FEINSTEIN.," Mr. President.  I  rise today to introduce a series of bills,  S. 2386, S. 2387, S. 2388, and S. 2390, designed  to  better  prepare  for  catastrophic wildfires like the ones that recently devastated Southern California.  The Nation watched as these  fires  swept, uncontrolled,  through  several  counties.  They caused the evacuation of an estimated  750,000  people—the  largest  evacuation in California history.  They burned more than 500,000 acres.  Destroyed more than 2,000 homes.  Killed 10 people. Injured 130.  The financial damage is estimated in  the billions.  Simply put: This was a major disaster.  It was not the first. Southern California suffered similar wildfire losses  just 4 years ago.  We must  face the  fact that catastrophic wildfires are in California’s future, and the future of other states.  California  is  tinder-dry.  Global  warming is real, leading to extended  droughts and longer fire seasons.  Fires are larger, and they burn hotter  and with more intensity.  More and more people are living in  areas at high risk of wildfire. There are  more than 5 million homes  in California  alone  in  this  high-threat  ‘‘wildland-urban interface.’’  Across the rest of the country, there  are nearly 40 million more homes in  the wildland-urban interface.  So the question comes: What can be  done?  There  is no doubt that we cannot  fully eliminate wildfires.  But I believe we can take steps now  to better protect communities, to improve firefighting capabilities, and to  improve relief and recovery aid.  The four bills introduced today will  get this process started. They are the  Fire Safe Community Act, which would  establish new  incentives  for communities at risk of wildfires to adopt a  new model Fire Safe ordinance; the  Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief  Act, to make sure that qualified individuals, displaced by major disasters,  can make their mortgage and rental  payments; the Disaster Rebuilding Assistance Act, to increase the amount of  Federal  dollars  available  to  homeowners whose rebuilding costs outstrip  their insurance coverage; and the Managing Arson Through Criminal History,  MATCH, Act, requiring states to create  registries of convicted arsonists.  Let me go into greater detail on each  of these bills.  FIRESAFECOMMUNITYACT  This bill will help protect our communities from the catastrophic effects  of wildfires.  Most importantly, it does three key  things: it instructs the National Institute of Standards and Technology to  develop a model ordinance that will  serve as a baseline  for communities  seeking to protect their homes and  property from wildfire; it encourages  local  participation  by  allowing  for  greater Federal reimbursement of firefighting  costs  in  communities  that  adopt the model ordinance; and it creates a grant program to encourage responsible development practices that  meet model guidelines in the wildland-  urban interface.  In effect, the Federal Government  would become the partner to local governments as they seek to make their  communities fire-safe.  As I have said, we can never stop  wildfires. But we can take important  VerDate Mar 15 2010  22:07 Mar 13, 2014 Jkt 081600 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:€7SENATE\S16NO7.REC S16NO7 Y T I R U C E S L I A C O S h t i w 1 G 4 P S G C K S D n o r e h a m m         ",2007
2744,66,2007-11-16,Mr. HATCH.," Mr. President, today I  join with Senators ROCKEFELLER, LOTT,  to introduce the Medicare Quality Improvement Modernization Act of 2007, S. 2396.  As background  for my colleagues,  Medicare’s Quality Improvement Organization, QIO, program has been in existence for 35 years. The program’s intent has always been to assure that  Medicare’s beneficiaries  receive high  quality medical care. The program has  and KENNEDY undergone a steady evolution. What  began as a program that called attention to hospitals and physicians whose  care deviated from the norms of medical practice has morphed into one that  seeks  to help physicians, hospitals,  nursing homes and other providers develop systems to improve their quality  of care.  The program has changed as the definition of quality changed. When Medicare’s peer review program was initiated, high quality care for a Medicare  beneficiary was  simply  not  to  be  among the unfortunate few whose medical care deviated from the norms of  local medical practice. Fortunate for  them, however, quality today  is the  routine adherence of providers to nationally accepted standards of care.  The legislative changes we propose  for the QIO program reflects an ever-  advancing definition of quality medical  care and a focus on helping providers  obtain it.  The QIO program has  three  functions. First, the program reviews the  medical care of beneficiaries who have  complaints about their care and provides the beneficiaries opinions. Second, the program supports  intensive  work  with  practitioners,  nursing  homes, managed care plans and hospitals to develop delivery systems that  improve  the  quality  of  their  care.  Third the program publicly reports system-level performance measures.  The bill I introduce today is faithful  to  the  results of a congressionally-  mandated review of the QIO program  reported in February, 2006. In that review, the IOM concluded ‘‘The QIO program provides a potentially valuable  nationwide infrastructure dedicated to  promoting quality health care.’’ For  example, the QIO program is responsible for a substantial part of the National Healthcare Quality Report published by the Agency for Healthcare  Research and Quality.  The IOM report called for changes in  the QIO program. Its principal findings  and recommendations were that the  local QIO boards are heavily physician-  dominated with  little consumer representation. Existing  legislation  requires specific levels of physician involvement, an outmoded board structure.  Also, the QIO  functions should be  harmonized with other federal quality  Initiatives.  It found that the QIOs were ‘‘. . . restricted from contracting with health  care providers in its state for technical  assistance or review services similar to  those covered by its core Medicare contract.’’ The IOM committee concluded  that QIOs would be able to serve more  providers and expand their function beyond Medicare beneficiaries to the entire healthcare system if they could  contract  for  services  to  supplement  their CMS funds.  The Committee also  recommended  removal of restrictions on public access  to  the QIO’s  findings. For  instance, beneficiaries have been unable  to review the results of investigations  that they requested.  The  IOM  recommended  that beneficiary reviews be removed from the  local QIOs.  The IOM committee concluded that  Congress and the secretary of DHHS  and CMS should improve program management by enhancing the contracting  process and improving communication  with the QIOs.  The  legislation I propose seeks to  strengthen the QIO’s infrastructure to  fit with an ever-tightening standard of  quality in medicine, believing that doctors and hospitals want to do the right  thing but also that patients should  have their say.  Many of the changes recommended  by the Institute of Medicine’s experts  and accepted by the experts at CMS do  not require statutory change, but some  do. Some program modifications are  sufficiently critical to Medicare’s beneficiaries, that while statutory language  may not be required to affect them, a  Congressional mandate is needed to assure them.  First, the Quality Improvement Organization Modernization Act of 2007  specifies that the Quality Improvement  Organizations offer education, instruction, and technical assistance to providers, practitioners, and Medicare Advantage plans.  It  incorporates plans  and providers in urban, rural, and frontier areas and providers that treat racial and ethnic minorities.  Second, our bill strengthens the review process  for  individual Medicare  beneficiaries. The QIOs must actively  educate beneficiaries of their right to  bring any concerns to the QIOs. The  QIOs must work with providers who are  reviewed to correct deficiencies where  they exist and to improve communication with patients where they do not.  The bill specifies that the findings of  the review must be disclosed to the  beneficiary requesting the review but  not before giving the provider an opportunity to respond to the findings.  The review functions are left with the  local QIOs and not delegated to other  entities to perform.  The bill specifies that the findings of  reviews may not be used in medical  malpractice  litigation, otherwise the  QIOs would serve more to screen cases  for litigation than they would to improve the quality of care.  Third, in order to be certain that the  QIOs are appropriately judging the severity of the errors they find and appropriately recommending sanctions to  the Secretary, the Office of Inspector  General will contract for an audit of 10  percent of one year’s QIO reviews during each 5-year contract period.  Fourth, program administration  is  strengthened and its goals focused. The  program’s scope of work must incorporate the priorities of  local stakeholders.  A strategic advisory committee will  advise the Secretary on program goals,  on program performance, and on harmonization of the QIO’s quality functions with other federal and non-federal quality initiatives.

2754,87,2007-11-16,Mr. ORTIZ.," Madam Speaker, I rise to bid  farewell to a member of the Hispanic family in  the House of Representatives; Dean Aguillen  of the Speaker’s office is leaving the Hill this  week, and he will be greatly missed by me  and many other members of the House.  We  labor  together, we  fight  together, and  we plot together . . . as a party, as a Caucus  . . . and we get close to the staff with whom  we work.  Dean Aguillen is a San Antonio native and  he has seen the House run by Republicans  . . . and leaves us with the knowledge that a  Democratic Majority is a better deal for the nation.  Dean has been a magnificent ambassador  for Speaker PELOSI for the Texans and for the  Hispanic Caucus. He is always available for  us, always works  to ensure our needs are  met, and answers our questions fully and in a  timely way.  Dean told me today that he was inspired to  get into politics by his local member of Congress when he was a little kid. Henry B. Gonzalez, an icon of Texas politics, had a Saturday morning  talk  show  that Dean  never  missed.  That molded his thinking and motivated him  to find his way to Washington. He leaves this  place as a much-loved staff member; and he  leaves with many, many friends.  Dean, we’ll miss you man. I know Speaker  PELOSIwill miss you. Thank you for all your  work and your dedication over the years. Vaya  con Dios.  f  A TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES SLATER  OF  LOMA  LINDA  UNIVERSITY  MEDICAL CENTER  HON. JERRY LEWIS  OFCALIFORNIA  INTHEHOUSEOFREPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 15, 2007  ",2007
2755,87,2007-11-16,Mr. LEWIS of California.," Madam Speaker, I  rise today to pay tribute to one of the most  outstanding individuals I have come to know in  my 30 years in Congress, Dr. James Slater of  Loma Linda University Medical Center, who pioneered the development of the proton beam  cancer therapy.  When Loma Linda University Medical Center in my district recruited Dr. James Slater to  develop a radiation oncology program in 1970,  they gained a unique expert in the field of radiation  therapy. Before he became a physician, Dr. Slater’s main  interest was physics.  With a profound understanding of the way radiation works on the human body, Dr. Slater  set out to find a way to gain more control of  the process and reduce the toll this therapy  takes on patients.  He became convinced after nearly 15 years  of research that the best way to accomplish  this was  through proton beams, which had  been tested in research laboratories but never  developed as a permanent medical  therapy.  After meeting with scientists and physicians  from around the world, Dr. Slater began looking for a partner to develop the technology for  a proton-beam treatment center. When private  industry declined  to  take  the challenge, he  turned to Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) near Chicago, which had been  actively involved in research on the potential  for medical technology. In 1986, the medical  center and Fermilab—backed by the Department of Energy—agreed  to build a proton-  beam treatment center at Loma Linda.  One of the most marvelous experiences I’ve  had as a member of Congress came in 1987,  when Dr. Slater and his team came to my office to lay out the plan for a new way of treating cancer  tumors.  I was quickly convinced  that his idea was fabulous, and his ability to  bring together the medical, technical and operational experts was superb. During a hearing  before the House Energy Appropriations Subcommittee, my  colleagues  agreed. Many  members had family or close friends who had  been afflicted with cancer, and  they were  eager to help find a new treatment plan. Major  funding was approved and the center opened  in 1990.  Thanks to the dedication of the medical center and the support of Congress and Department of Energy, Dr. Slater’s vision has become a reality in the past 20 years. More than  11,500 patients have  received  treatment  for  prostate cancer, brain tumors, and other forms  of cancer. A research program  is promising  new ways  to  treat breast cancer early and  possibly avoid mastectomies in many cases.  Another program has helped the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  research  the effects of space radiation and design better equipment for astronauts. Since 2003, four  more  proton-beam  treatment  centers  have  opened in other areas of the country.  Madam Speaker, I am delighted to tell my  colleagues that Loma Linda University Medical  Center has decided to honor this pioneering  medical scientist by naming the proton beam  treatment center  in his honor. There  is no  doubt that this honor is richly deserved, and  memorializes a true visionary and benefactor  for thousands of cancer patients in the future.  Please join me in congratulating Dr. Slater on  receiving this honor, and thanking him for his  dedication to opening new horizons in the fight  against cancer.  f  TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT FIRST  CLASS DAVID A.

2756,87,2007-11-16,Mr. KILDEE.," Madam Speaker, I rise today  to pay tribute to one of America’s fallen heroes, Sergeant First Class David A. Hartman.  Sergeant Hartman will be honored on December 1 by the Bay City United States Army Reserves. They will dedicate the Drill Hall at the  Bay City Michigan Reserve Center  in his  memory.  David Hartman is remembered by his family  and friends as loving, fair-minded, honest, fun-  loving,  family-oriented, and  job-oriented. He  worked hard, and was not afraid to step in and  help out. He followed his father’s example and  signed up for the military when he graduated  from high school. He was a 21-year veteran of  the military. David served in the first Gulf War  and came home with Gulf War Syndrome. He  was eligible for a medical discharge but he decided to stay in the military to continue serving  his country. Sergeant Hartman stated that he  wanted to join the people going to fight and  lead by example. On July 17, 2004, at the age  of 41, David Hartman was asked to make the  ultimate sacrifice for his country when the vehicle he was driving was struck by an improvised explosive device in Bayji Iraq. Sergeant  Hartman was serving  in  Iraq with  the Army  Reserves 401st Transportation Company from  Battle Creek, MI. He is survived by his wife,  Robbin, son, Benjamin, and daughter, Heather.

I thank everyone who has  been  involved  in getting us to this  point. It has been challenging, but we  have a product, as you know,  that  came out of committee unanimously.  I thank Senator HARKINand Senator  for  their  leadership  in  bringing us to this point. I also thank  Senator CONRAD for his budget expertise that helped get us to this point,  and so many other people who have  worked very hard to create a product  that we all can be very proud of.  We do not only support traditional  agriculture, which is very important—  people  in my State  think of automobiles, particularly as we are talking  about the energy debate now—but our  second largest industry is agriculture.  So this is a very important bill from  the  standpoint  of  the  economy  of  Michigan.  We have traditional agricultural programs that are supported in this legislation which I am very pleased about.  But we also do something very important. We take a step toward the future  in this bill in a number of ways.  Also  very  important  to me  and  Michigan, and  I appreciate my colleagues  supporting  the effort,  is  to  have half of the crops grown by farmers  in the United States, fruit and vegetable growers, called specialty crops,  included in a very real way for the first  time in this farm bill. That is historic.  We are  talking about many  family  farmers, folks who are growing the apples and asparagus and the cherries and  the blueberries and the oranges and all  of the foods we want our children to  eat.  We tell our children: Eat your fruits  and vegetables. Well, this farm bill for  the  first  time makes  a  permanent  place, a permanent home  for  those  growers.  I appreciate my colleagues  who have worked with me in order to  be able to make that happen.  We also take a turn to the future  with alternative energy. I thank the  distinguished Presiding Officer  from  Colorado  for his passion around the  issue of alternative energy as well as  my distinguished colleague from South  Dakota for his interest and leadership  around these issues as well.

2775,27,2007-12-10,Mr. CARPER.," Mr. President, today I  celebrate the tenure of Wesley College  president Dr. Scott D. Miller. After 10  years as president, Dr. Miller will step  down to assume leadership of Bethany  College in my home State of West Virginia in January 2008.  Founded in 1873, Wesley College is located on 50 acres in historic Dover, DE.  Delaware’s oldest private college, the  school offers 30 bachelors and 4 associates degrees, and master’s degrees in  nursing, education, business administration and environmental science.  I first met Dr. Miller in 1997 when I  was Governor of Delaware, and he was  appointed as the 15th president of Wesley College. During his tenure, the college proudly reported record applications, a climbing enrollment, increased  alumni participation and a greater minority presence. For these and other  accomplishments, Dr. Miller has been  nationally acclaimed for his contributions to higher education.  Under Dr. Miller’s leadership, Wesley  experienced substantial growth, including  total enrollment  increases  from  1,052 to 3,210 and $67 million raised in  the Campaign  for Wesley  fund, with  more than $40 million earmarked for  capital renovations and new construction. Dr. Miller oversaw the creation of  four graduate programs and the establishment of a New Castle County campus for Adult Studies. In addition, he  established an undergraduate nursing  program and  five other new undergraduate majors.  Beyond academics, Wesley College  has also been granted membership in  the  selective Capital Athletic Conference and enjoys the addition of new  varsity sports programs. Congratulations to the Wolverines who are again  in the quarterfinals this year for the  NCAA Division III South Region collegiate football championship.  To maintain Wesley’s support of the  local community, Dr. Miller was also  instrumental  in building an alliance  with Delaware State University and  the Friends of the Capital Theater to  maximize  the usage of  the historic  Capital Theater, positioning it as the  premiere  performing  arts  center  in  southern Delaware. The  relationship  was formalized in January 2007 with  the three organizations becoming equal  partners in the operation, management  and programming of the theater.  In addition to all the accolades already mentioned, Scott and his family  have become valued  friends of mine  and of many others in Delaware over  the past decade. Dr. Miller’s wife Ann  is an educator in her own right and has  been a full partner with her husband in  supporting his efforts to lead Wesley to  new heights. We were also  lucky to  have their daughter Ashlee serve as an  intern  in my Wilmington office this  past summer.  Scott and Wesley College have also  supported my charter school initiative  in Delaware by being one of the first  colleges in America to charter and provide space for a public charter school.  Additionally, Wesley College was one  of the first institutions to sign on as a  partner of a homeownership initiative  that I started in Dover by supporting  the effort to increase homeownership  rates  in  the capital city.
