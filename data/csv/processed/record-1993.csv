1,Senate,103,-0.293,23,2,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr. President, today  I am pleased that the Senate is consid ering the nomination of Dr. John H.  Gibbons  to serve as Director of  the  White House Office  of Science  and  Technology Policy  [OSTP]. As with  other OSTP directors, Dr. Gibbons,  if  confirmed, also will be Assistant to the  President for Science and Technology  and  hence  the President's personal  science advisor.  Dr. Gibbons  is well-known  in Con gress, having served since 1979 as the  Director of the Office of Technology  Assessment  [OTA]. Those of us who  have been on the Technology Assess ment Board over the years have come  to admire him a great deal.  The OSTP Director's position has al ways been a challenging job, but never  more so than today. Three years after  the fall of the Berlin Wall, our Govern ment has barely begun the huge task of  converting  its $76 billion annual  re search budget from cold war priori ties  to today's most urgent needs, particu larly economic needs. President Clin ton is right: The economy is the issue.  As OSTP Director and Science Adviser,  Dr. Gibbons will be  in a position  to  help the President to remold the Fed eral science and technology establish ment to promote long-term economic  growth in an increasingly competitive  world economy. It is a daunting task one  that will  require new priorities,  major budget shifts, and new methods  of working with industry. The future of  our country depends on how well the  new administration meets  this chal lenge.  ",1993

4,Senate,103,-0.332,166,2,Mr. PELL.," Mr. President, our coun try has long been well served by the  wisdom of George Kennan, who has the  double distinction of being both our  elder statesman and our most distin guished  scholar of American  foreign  policy.  Ambassador and Professor Kennan's  career spans more than 60 years, from  his early days as a foreign service offi cer in Berlin and Russia to his current  eminence as professor emeritus at the  Institute  for  Advanced  Study  in  Princeton. The Foreign Relations Com mittee has repeatedly benefited from  his  thoughtful  testimony.  In a  rare  tribute he received a standing ovation  from  the committee and a  crowded  hearing room when he testified before  us on the end of the cold war and what  should be done to assist the former So viet Union  in  the  transformation  to  democratic and  free market  institu tions. The only other time that I recall  a similar burst of applause was when  Professor Kennan had testified before  us some 20 years earlier.  On October 28, 1992, Professor Kennan  published  a  characteristically  pene trating article on the op-ed page of the  New York Times under  the headline  ""The G.O.P. Won the Cold War? Ridicu lous."" In the article Professor Kennan  observed, ""The suggestion that any ad ministration had  the power  to  influ ence decisively the course of a tremen dous domestic political upheaval in an other great country on the other side  of  the globe  is  simply childish. No  great country has that sort of influ~  ence on the internal developments of  any other one.""  Professor Kennan observed  that as  early as the late 1940's it was possible  to see that the Communist regime was  becoming  ""dangerously  remote  from  the concerns and hopes of the Russian  people."" He writes:  There were some of us  to whom  it was  clear, even at that early date, that the re gime as we had known it would not last for  all time. We could not know when or how it  would be changed; we knew only that change  was inevitable and impending.  Mr. President, without pretending to  assume Professor Kennan's mantle of  wisdom, I would note that my own ex perience in the Communist controlled  regions of Eastern Europe during  the  same period-that is,  the late 1940's caused me also to predict the eventual  demise of communism. During my own  foreign service during that period,  it  was apparent to me that communism  did not fulfill the material or the spir itual needs of the people it pretended  to  serve,  and  that  it contained  the  seeds of its eventual undoing.  Professor Kennan goes on  to note  how some of America's hardline poli cies over the years may actually have  delayed the eventual collapse of com munism. He writes:  Nobody-no country, no party, no person ""won"" the cold war. It was a long and costly  political  rivalry  fueled  on both  sides by  unreal and exaggerated estimates of the in tentions and strength of the other party. It  greatly overstrained the economic resources  of both counties. leaving both, by the end of  the 1980's, confronted with heavy financial,  social and, in the case of the Russians, polit ical problems that neither had anticipated  and for which neither was fully prepared.  . Mr.  President,  Professor  Kennan  speaks to the dilemma we face today,  which  is how  to  invigorate our own  economy and at the same time to play  our necessary  role  in  assisting  the  countries of the former Soviet Union to  overcome  the devastation caused by  more than 70 years of Communist rule.  The question of who ""won"" the cold  war fades  to insignificance in face of  these massive challenges confronting  both  sides  in  the aftermath of  this  tragic era. The costs to the people of  the former Soviet Union are becoming  more obvious with each passing month.  The burdens on the West are also great  as we join with our allies in helping to  bring about democratic change and a  free market economy in that region.  I ask unanimous consent that the ar ticle by George F. Kennan in the Octo ber 28, 1992, New York Times be printed  in the RECORD at this point.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the New York Times, Oct. 28, 1992]  THE GOP WON THE COLD WAR? RIDICULOUS  (By George F. Kennan)  PRINCETON, NJ .-The claim heard in cam paign rhetoric that the United States under  Republican Party leadership ""won the cold  war"" is intrinsically silly.  The suggestion  that any Administration  had  the power  to  influence decisively  the  course of a  tremendous domestic political  upheaval  in another great country on an other side of the globe is simply childish. No  great country has that sort of influence on  the internal developments of any other one.  As early as the late 1940's, some of us liv ing in Russia saw that the regime was be coming dangerously remote  from  the con cerns and hopes of the Russian people. The  original  ideological and emotional motiva tion of Russian Communism had worn itself  out and become lost in the exertions of the  great war. And there was already apparent a  growing generational gap in the regime.  These  thoughts found a place  in my so called X article in Foreign Affairs in 1947.  from which  the policy of containment  is  widely seen to have originated. This percep tion was even more clearly expressed in a  letter from Moscow written in 1952, when I  was Ambassador there, to H. Freeman Mat thews, a  senior State Department official,  excerpts from which also have been widely  published. There were some of us to whom it  was clear, even at that early date, that the  regime as we had known it would not last for  all time. We could not know when or how it  would be changed; we knew only that change  was inevitable and impending.  By the time Stalin died, in 1953, even many  Communist Party members had come to see  his dictatorship as grotesque, dangerous and  unnecessary, and there was a general impres sion that far-reaching changes were in order.  Nikita Khrushchev took the leadership in  the resulting liberalizing tendencies. He was  in his crude way a firm Communist, but he  was not wholly unopen to reasonable argu ment. His personality offered  the greatest  hope for internal political liberalization and  relaxation of international tensions.  The downing of the U-2 spy plane in 1960,  more than anything else, put an end to his  hope. The  episode humiliated Khrushchev  and discredited his relatively moderate poli cies. It forced him to fall back, for the de fense of his own political position, on a more  strongly belligerent anti-American  tone of  public utterance.  The U-2 episode was the clearest example  of that primacy of military over political  policy that soon was to become an outstand ing feature of American cold war policy. The  extreme militarization of American discus sion and policy, as promoted by hard-line  circles over the ensuring 25 years, consist ently strengthened comparable hard-liners  in the Soviet Union.  The more America's political leaders were  seen in Moscow as committed to an ultimate  military rather than political resolution of  Soviet-American  tensions,  the greater was  the tendency in Moscow to tighten the con trols by both party and police, and the great er the braking effect on all liberalizing ten dencies in the regime. This, the general ef fect of cold war extremism was  to delay  rather  than hasten  the great change  that  overtook the Soviet Union at the end of the  1980's.  What did the greatest damage was not our  military preparations  themselves,  some of  which (not all) were prudent and justifiable.  It was rather the unnecessarily belligerent  and threatening tone in which many of them  were publicly carried forward. For this, both  Democrats and Republicans have a share of  the blame.  Nobody-no country, no party, no person ""won"" the cold war. It was a long and costly  political  rivalry,  fueled on both  sides by  unreal and exaggerated estimates of the in tentions and strength of the other party.

Look at  the numbers:  60  percent of mothers  with children under the age of 6 worked  in 1990. Let me repeat that. Sixty per cent of mothers with children under  the age of 6 worked in 1990, and 75 per cent of mothers with children ages 6 to  17 were working. I think there is uni versal agreement that motherhood and  fatherhood is challenging enough when  everything is going smoothly. Any one  of us who has raised a family can tell  you  it is  tough even  in  the best of  times. In the worst of times, Mr. Presi dent, it can be horrible.  Many of us know firsthand it does  not take too much to upset the apple cart when you are weighing all  the  things and all the responsibilities that  you have in your life. A parent never  should be  in a position of having  to  choose between a job and their child or  their job and a parent with cancer or  heart disease. What kind of a society  would promulgate those kinds of ter rible choices? The Family and Medical  Leave Act is a caring response to the  intense pressures that we all face  in  trying to balance our lives. It provides  job security and continuation of health  insurance.  Mr. President,  the debate over this  act has been raging almost as long as I  have been in Congress, and I was elect ed in 1982. It saddens me that it has  taken so long to pass this bill. But, on  the other hand, it pleases me that the  bill is headed toward enactment today  and it will be signed by a President  who understands, who personally un derstands the stresses and the needs of  everyday working families.  I  would  like  to  set  the  record  straight about how this bill would im pact the business community, and the  Senators from Connecticut and Massa chusetts have put into the RECORD very  important studies on this. But I want  to make the point, Mr. President, that  employers with 50 or  less employees  are exempted from this legislation. We  have exempted small business.  Further,  a  1991  nationwide  survey  conducted by the SBA, the Small Busi ness  Administration,  under  former  President George Bush, found that the  cost of permanently replacing an em ployee was significantly more than the  cost of granting leave. And, again, the  Senator from Connecticut pointed this  out. It costs more not to follow  this  policy than to follow this policy.  Working Women magazine's 1992 sur vey of  the 100 American  companies  ",1993
6,Senate,103,0.2,192,2,Mrs. KASSEBAUM.," Mr. President, I  would like to thank the Senator from  Utah for a very realistic appraisal of  this legislation. It is not that any of us  would not wish to see these policies put  in place, as has been said earlier, but  we are concerned about what happens  when they are mandated by  the Fed eral Government. I think one particu lar point is worth noting.  What about the case of an employer  who has 40 employees? Are not the 40  employees in that company and what  they might wish  to be able  to do  to  meet a family crisis just as important  as the 50 employees in a company who  must be provided leave under this bill?  I think as we sort through the fairness  of this and recognize the fact that half  of the workers in this country will not  be entitled  to  leave,  it does become  harder to justify. Because for someone  in a company where there are only 40  employees, a family crisis can be just  as tragic and leave from work just as  necessary as for someone who works in  a company that meets the criteria of 50  or more employees under this bill.  As some have said, they wish it could  apply to everyone, but politically they  know that will be too difficult. That is  a poor reason not to do it if indeed it is  so important. I think the fact that the  Senator  from Utah mentioned  the  problem from the standpoint of having  been a businessman who offered good  policies and  recognizes, however,  the  inherent difficulties  in  trying  to set  the parameters from here, it becomes  very obvious  that  there are winners  and losers even though we might wish,  with  the best of intentions,  for only  winners with this legislation.  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.  ",1993
7,Senate,103,-0.328,192,2,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President,  let me  comment on the last point. We have a  little time before we get to an amend ment. This is an example of what exists  and has existed for years in law. Arbi trary thresholds have been set. Federal  laws are  replete with  them where 25  employees or  fewer are exempt  in a  whole array of statutes. Why not 20?  Why not 19? Why not 26?  In this particular case, a strong ef fort was made to exempt smaller businesses for two reasons: One is that in a  smaller business environment, there is  a  far greater likelihood that the em ployer and employee will know each  other. Therefore, when circumstances  arise affecting adoption or birth or se rious illness of a child, there is a  far  greater  likelihood  the  employer  is  going to extend those benefits, so there  is less concern these kinds of problems  will occur.  As the employment force gets larger,  it is unfair to expect that the employer  would necessarily know  everyone or  could spend their time  to become  in volved in the circumstances that affect  their families. Frankly, the other rea son  is  that we are  trying  to pass a  piece of legislation.  As I mentioned at the outset of my  remarks, I would not be standing here  offering this bill if,  in fact, what our  colleague from Utah did in his practice  was happening  today. But as I cited  statistically from the Chamber of Com merce and the Bureau of Labor Statis tics, regrettably it is not occurring. In  fact, when a survey was done of em ployers in the country about whether  or not they would move  in this area,  almost 65 percent said we have no in tention doing  this at all unless  the  State or  the Federal Government re quires us to do it. That is not exactly  welcome  information. When  only  37  percent of employers in this country,  despite 7 years of debating this-and I  see my other colleague from Utah who  was giving stern lectures to businesses  on this point going back a number of  years-they did not listen to him when  he said you ought to do  it, it is the  right thing to do it. But only 37 percent  of employers provide maternity leave.  A pregnant woman about  to bear a  child wants to be at home with that in fant and 67 percent of the employers of  this country say, ""I'm sorry, it is your  job or your child."" Only 18 percent pro vide  leave for elder care, a parent in  the  home  trying  to  be with  them;  around 20 percent on adoption.  How many children do we know of  today who are with special needs and  care,  trying  to get families  to adopt  these children? Please  take  them  in.  And yet most State agencies today re quire a minimum of 6 weeks where one  or  the other parent will be  there for  the bonding period. One State in this  country requires 4 months of one or the  other parent being there full time to be  with that newly adopted child. Here we  are talking about 12 weeks.  I am responsible each and every year  for  the reauthorization of the special  needs adoption legislation. We do it on  a voice vote. I have never had a single  Member of this body stand up and say  I object to  the, I  think it is $10 mil lion-my colleague  from Utah serves  with me on that committee-to assist  with  special  needs  adoption  in  this  committee.

We  have recently bombed Iraq because of its defi ance of the United Nations but no where  in  the world has the blatant abuse of the U.N.  authority been more grievous than in Serbia the murder of a Bosnian government official  who was supposedly being protected by U.N.  officials is a dramatic example of this.  In Friday's New York Times, Anthony Lewis  forcefully and  cogently made  the  case  for  President Clinton to change the morally inad equate  policy  he  inherited  from  President  Bush.  I think Mr. Lewis has made an extraor dinarily powerful case and  I ask  that  printed here.  it be  THE CLINTON DOCTRINE?  BosToN.-The classic reason for the use of  American military force has been to protect  our vital interests. In one pregnant sentence  of his Inaugural Address, President Clinton  added another.  ""When our vital interests are challenged,""  he said,  ""or  the will and conscience of the  international community is defied, we will act,  with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible,  with  force  when  necessary.""  (Emphasis  added.)  If that important new doctrine is to have  any meaning-if it is to be respected as the  Clinton Doctrine-the place to apply it is at  hand in Bosnia. And the time is now.  That Serbian aggression  in Bosnia defies  the conscience of the international commu nity cannot be in doubt. Not unless at the  end of the 20th century  the world accepts  mass murder, rape and terror directed at one  ethnic group.  ""It borders on genocide,"" Patricia Diaz  Dennis, Assistant Secretary of State  for  Human Rights, said of Serbian behavior as  she released  the annual State Department  report on human rights around  the world.  The Serbs' ""ethnic cleansing,""  the  report  said, was ""on a scale that dwarfs anything  seen in Europe since Nazi times.""  What can and should President Clinton do  to stop the horror? He may be tempted to  postpone the hard decisions because Cyrus  Vance and Lord Owen are seeming to make  progress in their negotiations on Bosnia. But  that would be a disastrous mistake, morally  and politically.  The singular fact about the Vance-Owen ef fort is that while it has gone on, over many  months, the Serbs have continued their kill",1993
10,,103,-0.265,283,2,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Speaker, I recently went  on an  inspection trip to Somalia.  I would like  to briefly address the House on the  fine  job  being  conducted  by  the  brave men  and  women of our Armed Forces who are carrying  out a most difficult assignment under ex tremely harsh conditions.  Significant  progress  has  been made  in  achieving  the goals set by President Bush  when he directed the deployment of our troops  to Somalia. Food  is being delivered  to  the  areas of the country most in need, the death  rates are down significantly for the citizens of  Somalia, and some local leadership is begin ning to emerge as secure zones are set up by  our troops.  Mr. Speaker, as we all know, although this  is a humanitarian mission  it  is also a dan gerous mission.  Living  conditions are  very  primitive  for our personnel. Day-to-day exist ence of our troops is one of long hours, hard  work, and often dangerous assignments.  Mr. Speaker, one of the marine units I vis ited on my trip had served in the Persian Gulf  during Christmas of 1990, was deployed over seas on a normal rotation during Christmas of  1991, was serving  in Somalia during Christ mas of 1992 and  is scheduled  for  rotational  deployment overseas  for Christmas of 1993.  They will be away from their families for four  Christmases  in a  row. None of  the  troops  complained about the situation, but my fear is  that as we downsize and the same units are  called on time after time for deployment over seas, we may begin to have a morale problem  and  have  difficulty  retaining  high  quality  troops.  I believe the biggest challenge  faced  by our military is to insure that we continue to  have a force of highly trained, highly motivated  personnel as we go through the phasedown of  force structure and budgets.  In conclusion Mr. Speaker,  I would simply  say that every Member of this legislative body  and every citizen of this country can be  im mensely proud of the magnificent  job being  done by the servicemen and servicewomen of  America who once again are selflessly serving  their country under extremely tough conditions  in a distant land.

12,Senate,103,-0.342,309,2,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr. President, I rise  again with all due respect to my col league from the State of Washington to  oppose  this amendment, and as well  again having been involved in the writ ing of the Washington law, that he is  referring to.  As written notice is required, as he  has stated,  there have not been any  problems. However, the Federal legisla tion that is before us is much stronger  legislation, not only for the employees  but for the employer and allows them  the flexibility of being silent on the  law to determine how they as a com pany will put this into effect. I think it  is much more effective for both those  who use it and those who have to im plement it.  I am also very concerned about the  minor exceptions. I think it very much  narrows the  law,  the exceptions that  are written into the amendment. I am  very concerned about the effect that it  may have on a young man whose moth er has Alzheimer's disease and he has  no way of knowing  that  tomorrow a  tragedy is going to strike and he needs  to take time off from work in order to  find her care.  I am very concerned about the effect  on a person whose son or daughter is in  a  car accident, who has no way of  knowing whether this would end up in  litigation because written notice was  not on file. It is a very deep concern to  those of us who feel this law is impera tive.  I  therefore oppose  the amend ment.  ",1993
13,Senate,103,0.322,309,2,Mr. DOLE.," Mr. President,  I  rise  in  support of  the Craig amendment of  which I am also an original cosponsor  and urge my colleagues to vote in its  favor.  If I had one wish regarding this de bate, it would be that we could erase  the last 7 years of partisan bickering  and gamesmanship that has governed  this issue. Unfortunately, the only leg acy of these debates and votes is that  individuals and groups have become  trapped by  their own  inflexible posi tions and rhetoric. New ideas and im portant arguments are only met with  deaf ears.  I sincerely believe that if you line up  S. 5 and S. 10,  the Craig amendment,  side-by-side and evaluate the pros and  cons of each bill, it is no contest.  S. 10  is by far  the better bill and  should  be  supported  regardless  of  whether you are a Democrat or Repub lican.  PRO-FAMILY  Both bills have been offered with the  intention of being pro-family. Indeed,  there is no debate over whether family  leave is a good idea or of the need to  provide a legislative solution to the in creasing demands and stresses of par ents caught between work and family.  Both bills provide up to 12 weeks of  leave for the birth, adoption, or place ment for foster care of a child. Both  bills also provide leave in the case of a  serious health condition of  the  em ployee, or the parent, spouse, or child  of the employee. Both bills provide for  the continuation of health  insurance  and for reinstatement rights upon com pletion of leave.  A big difference, however, is that S. 5  applies to employees of businesses with  50  or more workers whereas  S. 10  reaches to businesses with fewer than  500 employees.  So  if we are  looking at which bill  reaches more  families,  it is S. 10.  It  covers 48.7 million workers and 6 mil",1993
14,Senate,103,0.342,322,2,Mr. GRASSLEY.," Mr. President,  let  my say in response to the Senator from  Connecticut, that first of all, the proc ess that he  is talking about is based  under 50 years of  labor  law, dating  from  1938.  There  is  a  considerable  amount of experience with that proc ess. There is quite a track record, prob ably, in that process.  What we are talking about here is a  whole new right. If the Senator from  Connecticut, I ask, is so certain that  the process he describes would work so  well as it has in some other cases that  have 50-year histories,  then why does  he give access  to  the courts for  the  solving of these disputes? But he does.  There is going to be, obviously, under  new legislation, an explosion of these  cases. It seems to me that we ought to  provide a process for a new right that  allows  for arbitration, and even en courage that arbitration, but not have  it be binding-have  it be voluntary.  This is what this amendment does.  I yield, Mr. President, 5 minutes, or  whatever she uses, to the Senator from  Kansas.  ",1993
15,Senate,103,0.575,335,2,Mr. WALLOP.," Reserving the right to  object, and I shall not object, I told the  Senator from Connecticut this is not  his problem, but the reason for which  this unanimous-consent agreement  is  sought is not to speed up time but to  limit amendments. I  thought I heard  the Republican leader give his commit ment to the Democratic leader yester day that no second-degree amendments  would be offered and that they would  be given a full heads up on any amend ments offered. This amounts  to  the  statement on behalf of  the majority  leader that he does not trust that com mitment. I resent it, but I will not ob ject to it.  ",1993
16,,103,-0.216,361,2,Mr. DECONCINI.," Mr. President,  the  Select Committee on Intelligence yes terday  voted  unanimously  to  rec ommend Mr. Woolsey's confirmation to  the Senate, and I heartily endorse this  nomination to my colleagues.  Assuming  his  confirmation,  Mr.  Woolsey will be  the 16th person  to  serve  as Director  of Central  Intel ligence since the office was created in  1946 by President Truman. The respon sibilities and authorities of  the DC!  have evolved considerably since  then,  and, indeed, the capabilities of U.S. in telligence are vastly larger and vastly  more sophisticated than President Tru man could ever have imagined.  As the official responsible for coordi nating these capabilities and marshal ling them in support of the President  and other policymakers, the DOI plays  a uniquely sensitive and a uniquely im portant  role  in  the Government. He  must support policymakers, but not be come a  captive of policymakers. He  must ensure that the vast capabilities  at his disposal are effectively utilized,  but that they remain within the con fines of U.S.  law and bounded by our  national  interest. He  should be pre pared to take risks, and yet be prudent  and restrained in terms of both policy  decisions and resource allocations. In  short, the position demands an uncom mon measure of judgment and discre tion.  And the next DC!, it seems to me, is  likely to face an even more difficult as signment  than  his  predecessors.  hardly needs repeating that the world  has  dramatically  changed. While  it  It  may have become less threatening, it  has  also  become  vastly more  com plicated. The end of the cold war has  unleashed nationalistic, ethnic, and re ligious conflicts which had been pre viously held in check. We now have to  worry  about countries and  conflicts  which were not on our screens several  years ago.  The Intelligence Community has nec essarily shifted the focus of its atten tion. The  demands  for  information  have not abated; indeed, they have in creased. The review of intelligence re quirements which was completed last  year at DC! Gates' direction resulted in  not one  requirement being dropped.  Rather, the review resulted in only new  requirements being added.  Notwithstanding the apparent appe tite for intelligence, there is consider able  pressure,  given  our  enormous  budget deficits,  to do more with less,  and, I, for one, think it can and should  be done. While the demands for infor mation have not abated, it does seem  to me there is a potential for savings if  we  look objectively at the means we  use to collect it. In the past, we were  forced  to undertake costly  technical  programs because we were denied ac cess  to  certain  countries. Many  of  those countries are now accessible. By  the same  token, we developed highly  specialized capabilities  to be able  to  reach particular targets. Now many of  those targets no longer pose a threat to  us. On the other hand, because of our  long fixation on  the Soviet military  threat, we may not have developed ca pabilities to give us sufficient breadth  and  flexibility  in other parts of  the  world.  It seems  to me  the principal chal lenge for the new DC! will be to match  collection capabilities  to  the  rapidly  shifting needs of  the Government.  I  will be looking to the new DC! to un dertake a comprehensive review of this  problem as an early order of business,  and advise this committee of his find ings. Clearly, we must preserve a capa bility  to provide  the President with  warning of diplomatic and military cri ses around the world, and provide him  with  the  information  he  needs  to  choose between competing options. We  must provide our military forces with  the  information  they need  to deploy  around the world and to defend them selves against hostile actions. We must  preserve a capability to monitor and  verify the arms control agreements we  now have in place, as well as cope with  international narcotics and  terrorist  operations.  The cold war may be over, but there  are some demands on intelligence that  will remain constant whatever the po litical environment.  To  confront  these  daunting  chal lenges, President Clinton has,  in my  view, sent us a very able nominee. Jim  Woolsey  is,  in many ways, an  ideal  choice for this job. He has seen intelligence from the inside, but he brings  the vigor and fresh perspective of an  outsider.  The nominee's academic and profes sional credentials are  impeccable. A  graduate of Stanford where he became  a Rhodes scholar, with a graduate de gree from Oxford and a law degree from  Yale Law School, he has also served  with distinction  as  the Under Sec retary of the Navy during the Carter  administration, and as Ambassador to  the Conventional  Forces  in Europe  talks where he led the U.S. team to a  successful negotiation of a very com plicated and important treaty. He has  written and spoken frequently and elo quently on public policy issues.  Mr. President, yesterday the commit tee had the opportunity to question the  nominee in both open and closed ses sions. He acquitted himself quite well.  While he was unable to answer a few of  our questions pending the Clinton ad ministration developing its own posi tions, I cannot fault him for  this. He  did impress me, however, with what I  perceive to be a genuine committment  to the oversight process and to work ing with the oversight committee. The  importance of this committment can not be overemphasized.  In sum, Mr. President, I think we are  fortunate, indeed, to have a man of his  caliber nominated  for  this  position,  and I urge my colleagues  to support  him.

21,House,103,-0.408,452,2,Mr. ENGEL.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today once again  in support of  the  Family and Medical Leave Act. For  many of us, it has been a long and ar duous struggle to assure that this bill  becomes law.  Just last September, I stood here at  this same spot urging my colleagues to  vote to override President Bush's veto  of S. 5. Unfortunately, we were not suc cessful. However,  times have changed  dramatically and I have a renewed con fidence that this time the outcome will  be different.  H.R. 1 is a family and medical leave  bill that is equitable, sensitive to the  needs of our families, and reflective of  sound business practices.  In  fact,  a  September 21, 1992, editorial in Crain's  New York Business, a well-respected  New York business weekly and success ful small business, supports family and  medical leave. The company has volun tarily put in practice flexible working  arrangements,  including  shortened  work weeks, splitting a position, and  unpaid  leave. The editorial concludes  that-Not only can (we) manage more flexible ar rangements  to accommodate  the needs of  working parents, but it is in (our) own best  interest to do so.  Under  leave  to  include extraneous  material, I will  include  this editorial  for the RECORD.  While many  businesses  have  con cluded that flexible work arrangements  are beneficial. for both employee and  employer, others have lacked the fore sight and sound business sense in es tablishing such programs. That is why  Federal legislation is required.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of H.R. 1. The time is right for family  and medical leave.  Mr. Speaker, the editorial to which I  referred is included as follows:  [From Crain's New York Business, Sept. 21,  1992)  THIS SMALL FIRM FOUND How FAMILY LEAVE  CAN WORK  Once again, President Bush vows  to veto  legislation  requiring  that most companies  grant workers 12-week unpaid  leaves after  the birth or adoption of a child or in  the  event of a serious illness. The president says  such a burden would severely harm small  businesses. I know he's wrong.  We at Crain's New York Business believe  we know a lot about small companies, devot ing considerable resources to both covering  small businesses and to arguing their cause.  Essentially, I run a small business, the 22person Crain's editorial  staff. What  I've  learned in recent years is not only that I can  manage more flexible arrangements  to ac commodate  the needs of working parents,  but that it is in my own best interest to do  so.  The  issue of granting a  12-week unpaid  leave seems to me almost absurd, especially  as the father of a four-month-old who still  isn't sleeping through the night. Crain's re porters and editors are offered a three-month  leave after the birth of a child followed by  three months of part-time schedules. (Paid  leave varies between  four weeks  to eight  weeks.) We fill in with free-lancers and part timers. Sometimes our coverage of an indus try slips somewhat during such times. But it  would as well if the reporter, up night after  night with a baby, was  too  tired  to con centrate or if we had to hire a replacement.  For the record, I always come out ahead fi nancially.  Schedules for working parents (in our ex perience to date mothers) seemed more com plicated for a while, involving endless nego tiation,  the potential for resentment from  colleagues and possible harm to the paper.  But it also became clear that I had little  choice. One of our best reporters decided she  just wouldn't work full  time following  the  birth of her second child. We noticed her loss  almost  immediately. Eventually,  some  of  our valuable staffers would decide that work ing full  time at Crain's simply was incom patible with their famil:v responsibilities. It  was far from certain if their replacements  would be as good.  In reality, allowing flexibility wasn't com plicated at all. We have  two reporters on  three-day schedules, splitting a position. We  have  two staffers on four-day weeks. That  accommodates varying needs for health in surance (there isn't coverage for three days a  week),  job satisfaction and  time with  the  kids. We manage our work somewhat more  efficiently, we use free-lancers to fill in and  no one resents the situation.  My wife, by the way, just returned to work  on a  four-day schedule. She wanted three;  the business  library where she's employed  wanted five; they settled on four. Everyone's  happy.  If I can manage such arrangements, so can  other small businesses. That they won't is  why federal  legislation is required. I  think  that's what family values are all about. And  I don't think George Bush or Dan Quayle un derstand at all.-Greg David, Editor.  ",1993
22,House,103,-0.086,452,2,Mr. ORTON.," Mr. Speaker, as we have  commented, this is a shared goal which  is a laudatory goal in this body.  The question is: How do we get there  from here? The  concern  that  I  and  [Mr.  many others have is that the Family  and Medical Leave Act, as we are now  considering it, makes a great political  statement but has little positive  im pact and may, in fact, have significant  negative impact.  The impact in my district in Utah is  that 95 percent of the work force is al ready exempt under this bill, as they  are working for employers with fewer  than 50  employees. Of  the 5 percent  who would be covered, many are al ready covered under voluntary plans or  collective bargaining. Of the 1 or 2 per cent who would be covered, few could  afford to take unpaid leave.  The unintended impacts have already  been discussed.  ",1993

24,House,103,0.232,452,2,Mr. WELDON.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman  for yielding me  this  time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  legislation, but I rise in opposition to  the rule.  Few of us in this body can argue that  we are breaking new ground with the  Federal mandate  in  terms of family  leave policy, because in fact there are  few of us who have stood up and op posed everything  from  setting mini mum wage standards to worker safety  to unemployment compensation, or ac tually calling for the repeal of unpaid  leave for jury duty or for military ac tivity.  In fact, we have gone on  the  record in the past to support basic pa rameters for work men and women in  this country.  Many of us a few years ago worked  for a compromise on the original fam ily leave bill to tighten it up. As a mat ter of  fact, my  colleague,  the gen tleman from Tennessee  [Mr. GORDON],  and I offered this very bill 3 years ago  as a compromise in this body which we  are going to vote on today. That bill  tightened up the family  leave policy,  the definition, the requirement forcer tification,  the amount of time  to be  taken off, and protected small busi ness.  I urge its support by my colleagues  today.  The compromise that we are voting  on today did receive the support of 40  Republicans in the last session of Con gress because of the tightening up that  we made on the original legislation.  My one concern, however, with this  rule is the fact that the Committee on  Rules would not allow me to offer an  amendment that deals with any costs  associated with  this  legislation  that  are imposed on State and local govern ment. I think it is something we should  have had a chance to vote upon. It is  something we  should  look  at with  every bill that we vote on in this body,  and it is an issue that I will be bringing  up time and time again in this session.  For this reason, I urge my colleagues  to oppose the rule but to support pas sage of H.R. 1.  ",1993

It is not that we are trying to push this  through, as  the gentleman  indicated.  We are in the midst of 5 hours of debate  today on this measure.  We have been debating this measure  for over 2 years. It has passed this Con gress in both the House and the Senate.  It has been sent to an unsympathetic  President who  saw  the necessity  to  veto it. We are now counting on a new  and  younger President who  under stands the changing ways of the Amer ican work force.  We have single parents who are the  single wage earner in a family. We have  families, such as mine, where my chil dren, both husband and wife,  find  it  necessary to go out and work and sup port and educate their children.  We have  this changing work  force,  and  now  it is  time  that America  changed with  it.  Our  competitive  friends around the world, our economic  competitors, have already adopted this  type of policy, either on a paid or an  unpaid basis.  I guess it really is not fair to call  this a  family  leave bill, because no  small employers are affected at all.  Only those employers who have 50 or  more employees are requested merely  to provide job protection for their em ployees who find the necessity to leave  the workplace  rather  than surrender  the safety of their child or their par ent, merely a right to return to work  when they find the need for the family  is over. So  it really is not a  family  leave bill, but it is a  job protection  bill.  Madam Chairman, I  invite all Mem bers  to  join us  in saying let us offer  this minimal amount of job protection  for America's workers. It is time.  Madam Chairman,  today  I rise  to support  passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act.  This afternoon's debate is  long overdue. The  last time we passed legislation it was vetoed  at the White House. Today we are at the be ginning of a different era and the country will  be better for it.  This  issue, probably more  than any other,  highlights our Nation's character. The chang ing roles of men and women in the work force  are rapidly transforming America.  It is our re sponsibility as Members of Congress to shape  public policy  to suit  these changing  times.  America cannot be a superpower, promoting  human  rights and dignity abroad,  if we con tinue to ignore these basic humanitarian obli gations to our citizens.

Some Members have said it is apple  pie; it is feel-good legislation. Yes, it is  feel-good  legislation.  It makes  the  working people of  this country  feel  good.  Does it make our businesses feel bad?  No. Our businesses are exempted, 50  and  fewer employees. Key employees  are exempted.  One has to work a year before they  are covered by this act. There are all  kinds of exemptions that protect our  small businesses.  This issue ultimately is about caring  about our children and about caring  about  our  families. When  a  future  nominee, a potential Attorney General  Zoe Baird, is tripped up on this issue  and she potentially makes $500,000 a  year, think of the middle-class families  in our country that are experiencing  this problem of caring for each other,  their parents, and teachers.  After World War  II, we  extended  rights to our veterans to protect them  to come back to a  job, and that was a  moral imperative. This is an economic  imperative, to help our working people.  In conclusion, Madam Chairman, let  me say that President Clinton said this  well in his Inaugural. He says, ""A na tion must invest in its people as a fam ily invests in its children.""  Let us cast votes today to invest in  our families and our children.  ",1993
28,House,103,0.336,478,2,Mr. GOODLING.," Madam Chairman, I  yield  3 minutes  to  another  distin guished member of the committee, the  gentleman  from North Carolina  [Mr.  BALLENGER].  ",1993
29,House,103,0.464,478,2,Mr. BALLENGER.," Madam Chairman,  I rise in opposition to H.R. 1, the man dated leave act.  This legislation cannot be considered  in isolation. Madam Chairman,  there  are a number of antibusiness proposals  on the legislative fast track that could  have an extreme and adverse effect on  the American economy. Soon we will  be voting on the Striker Replacement  Act, a massive overhaul of the Occupa tional Safety and Health Act, another  bill to add punitive and compensatory  damages  to  litigation under  the Em ployee Retirement  Income  Security  Act, along with a bill to eliminate the  caps on damages under the Civil Rights  Act, and finally, a minimum wage in crease  is also expected. Undoubtedly,  Mrs.  Rodham  Clinton's mandated  health insurance proposal cannot be far  behind.  At  a  time when  our  economy  is  struggling, we do not need to restrict  business with further noncompetitive  measures. As a  small businessman,  I  can tell you that many of these pro labor bills would drastically  impact  the small business owner and dramati cally  increase  the  cost  of business.  Small  businesses  have  traditionally  generated  much  of  the  economic  growth and new  jobs  in  the Nation.  From 1988  to 1990,  the overwhelming  number of the new jobs in the Nation  were created by small businesses.  In  North Carolina, small businesses cre ated 100 percent of the net new  jobs  over the same time period. These anti small business bills will  retard  the  economy and increase unemployment.  If the Federal Government is really  interested  in  improving  employees'  working conditions, it should help cre ate a more productive environment for  businesses. To my way of thinking, it  is reasonable and fair to expect indus try to offer new benefits for employees  if it is able to afford them. Our policies  should  help make  businesses more  competitive,  not weigh  them  down  with cumbersome mandates.  As I have argued at committee hear ings, markups,  and during  previous  floor debate-family and medical leave  is a good employee benefit. It is  the  Federal mandate  that remains a bad  policy. My opposition  to yet another  Federal mandate can best be explained  in simple business terms. As many of  my colleagues know, I operate a small  business that prints and converts plas tics. My  business,  like other  small  firms across the country, sets aside a  certain amount of money for benefits  and benefit programs. In my company  in Hickory, NC, we provide a number of  employee benefits  including a  retire ment plan, 18 paid vacation days, per sonal leave, paid time off,  jury duty,  sick leave, health insurance, life insur ance, maternity,  and  family  leave.  Under H.R. 1, company and employees  lose  the  flexible  option of choosing  benefits that meet their specific needs.  This is a  lose/lose situation for every one concerned. My employees lose the  choice of benefits that they currently  enjoy, and, as an employer, I lose the  flexibility  to  tailor benefit programs  that fit the needs of my individual em ployees.  0 1730  Madam Chairman,  I  ask my  col leagues to join me one last time in op posing a mandated leave act.

I am fortu nate  to have been a member of  the  Georgia General Assembly and to have  participated in enacting such a piece of  legislation  last year .in  the State of  Georgia for State employees.  Time and again over  the 16 years  that I was in public life I had people  come  to me who were  employed  in  State government and who were em ployed in the private sector and say,  ""Mr. Bishop, I need to go  to work.

31,House,103,0.236,491,2,Mr. MYERS of Indiana.," Madam  Chairman, I yield myself my remaining  time.  Madam Chairman,  I  regret  that  I  must take the well this evening and op pose  this  legislation. As a parent of  two daughters, a grandparent, as one  whose parents and mother-in-law suf fered serious illness before they passed,  and having a wife that has had three  cancers in 3 years, requiring very seri ous and long and extended treatment, I  do not think I have to have my creden tials  in family values questioned  to night. I agree with the concept many  who have taken the floor this evening  have  talked about, that what we are  trying to do for people is a good idea.  But my goodness,  I can  think of so  many things that are good.  But I am somewhat concerned as an  employer, and I have been an employer,  and we had policies, and it was a policy  usually  that we  allowed  time, with  pay, for people who had a serious ill ness or a pregnancy, or even the adop tion of a child, as long as the time off  was  reasonable  and  financially  the  business could support it. But there is  no concern here about the business.  I am shocked to hear statements al most  to  the point of where, well,  I  would like to go to work on a day that  is convenient for me, but if there  is  anything else  I  could do  that day  I  would rather do  that. I suppose many  people  feel  this way. But  there has  been  very  little  concern  today  ex pressed about the employers of these  people who are going to have all of this  time off about replacement of an indi vidual who may be very, very vital to  that institution. It is not as easy as  hiring a Kelly Girl to come in and do  the payroll.  So I have been concerned about the  attitude that has been expressed here  today and the damage we are doing to  small businesses, businesses  that are  already  burdened  from  competition  from outside of the United States as  well as other larger industries. Many  businesses are going bankrupt  today.  This is going to probably drive more  in to bankruptcy. And to say that it is  not going to do damage to small busi ness  is wrong. Members say well, 50  employees is not small, and certainly  50 up to some number above that still  is not a relatively small business. So  we are impacting these businesses, re gardless of how much we  talk about  not having that intention. I am quite  sure no one here has the intent of driv ing any business out, but the effect of  this legislation is going to be to do se rious damage  to an already burdened  business community.  Who is going to hire a young woman  who is of childbearing age if they have  a choice between hiring her and some one who is not likely to take time off?  Think about that if you were going to  be  the employer. Obviously very  few  have  been  employers,  judging  from  some of the colloquy I have heard here  today. Not many have stood in those  shoes. But we are going  to hurt  the  very people we are trying to help here,  because if faced with the situation of  hiring one or the other, they are going  to hire the person that is not going to  be  taking 12 weeks off,  in all  likeli hood.  How about  they pay  issue? People  now are getting paid for less time. Who  is going to pay these people if they are  not already in a contract  to provide  pay  for extended  leave, even  though  they may be paying today, even though  this law is passed? They are going to  stop this payment, and some people are  going to take leave.  I think we are doing serious damage.  I  can count.  I  know  the  skids are  greased and this is going to pass, and it  is going  to go  down  to  the White  House, and it is going to be signed by  the President. But I  think we should  stop and think about  the damage we  are going to do  today to an economy  that is trying to recover.  I would like to vote for maybe a more  reasonable 6 weeks, even with all of the  conditions, but I just simply cannot to night support 12 weeks, and I  regret  that  I  cannot.  I had an amendment  that I would like to have offered to re duce this to 6 weeks, and I tried for 6  weeks, but unfortunately the rule does  not provide for this.  Madam Chairman,  balance of my time.  ",1993
32,House,103,-0.379,491,2,Mr. HOYER.," Madam Chairman,  I  thank  the distinguished chairman of  the Education and Labor Committee  for yielding me this time, and I rise in  very strong support of this legislation.  Madam Chairman,  I  rise  today  in  strong support of H.R. 1,  the Family  Medical Leave Act.  I would  like  to  thank and commend the chairmen of  the Education and Labor and Post Of fice and Civil Service Committees for  bringing  this monumental  legislation  to the floor so expeditiously.  For  the past 7 years,  the Family  Medical Leave Act has been brought  before this Congress with the certainty  that it would be vetoed.  In  the 103d  Congress, we  know  that we have  a  President who not only lauds the goals  of the Act but who has demonstrated  that he is firmly committed to giving  the American  people what  they  so  critically deserve: The ability to care  for  their families without the fear of  losing their jobs or their health insur ance coverage. It is, in my opinion, the  right thing to do.  Over the past few decades, we have  seen the fabric of our families unravel.  The number of children living in sin gle-parent households has  increased,  the number of children living in pov erty has increased and the number of  I yield back  the  juveniles living in custodial care, out side of  their  families has  increased.  And nearly 20 percent of our Nation's  children, poor or not, do not receive  adequate preventive health care or the  full course of immunizations required  to guard against polio, diphtheria, tet anus, and other diseases. Aged and ill  parents, new born babies and newly  adopted children are being cared for by  someone other  than  family members  because  their  financial  situations  render them unable to rock the job se curity boat by taking a  few weeks to  care for or bond with their loved ones.  The American people deserve better  than this. The Family Medical Leave  Act does not require an employer  to  provide paid leave for an employee, nor  does it require that an employer suffer  economic harm by granting their high est paid employees family or medical  leave.  In  fact,  the bill  covers only  about 5 percent of employers and half  of all employees. The obligation pro vided in this bill is, small and the ne cessity to respond to the crisis in our  families is great. We must strike a bal ance. And,  I believe  this bill accom plishes that goal.  Madam Chairman,  I am mindful of  the concerns of the business commu nity with regard to federally mandated  benefits and I fully intend to support  efforts to reduce the burdens we place  upon business. However, I believe that  the bill before us will be good for busi ness. Over  the past few years, many  companies have come to recognize that  an employee who has job security and  good benefits, works harder and stays  on the job longer.  Madam Chairman,  stitute for a parent.  No one I am convinced can bestow  the love or provide for the needs of a  child like a mother or father. No one I  am convinced can provide the care and  support a  person dying  from cancer  like  a  family member. Our  schools,  nurses, doctors, counselors, and gov ernment can not become surrogate par ents. It is a responsibility which I be lieve all of us want to meet. It has be come  increasingly difficult  to do  so.  With passage of  the Family Medical  Leave Act the Congress will have taken  an important step toward reinforcing  family responsibilities and a more se cure and productive work force.  Twelve weeks may not be perfect, 18  weeks may not be perfect, 6 weeks may  not be perfect. The fact of the matter  is we have a problem in America, and  the problem we have  in America  is  families,  family unity,  family  struc ture, young people feeling a sense of in security, and parents being able to call  upon their children at times of great  illness.  We have had a substantial change in  America over the last 40 years, indeed  over the last 20 years, and that is that  we have a substantial number of his toric caregivers now in the work force.  is no sub there  ",1993
33,House,103,0.361,504,2,Mr. EWING of Illinois.," Madam Chairman,  I  rise in opposition to H.R. 1, the so-called Fam ily and Medical Leave Act.  Despite  it's ""feel good"" name,  this  legisla tion  is bad for businesses and the economy,  it is also not a priority of working women and  men.  For those of my colleagues who spent any  time with business constituents  this winter,  they know  that one of  the  top concerns of  these entrepreneurs is the explosive growth of  Federal mandates and the crippling costs they  impose. Well, now  is  the  time  for my col leagues to  take a stand  for  those struggling  businesses  in  their district and vote against  this harmful legislation.  The Family and Medical Leave Act will es tablish a nationwide  formula  for all affected  companies, painting  them all with a broad  brush and forcing  them to provide the same  type of family and medical leave policies.  In stead of allowing individual businesses to de termine the benefits they can afford to off er,  and the kind their employees want, this legis lation will shackle employers to a single inflexi ble federally-mandated formula.  In an economy in which every employment  situation  is different, and  in which  the work  force  is constantly changing, employers and  employees should have the  freedom  to work  together to establish benefits which are mutu ally acceptable. Working women  and men  should have  the  flexibility  to negotiate with  their employers  for the  type of benefits they  value the most. For example, those just start ing a family may want more liberal maternity  leave, while older workers may want more lib eral policies for personal illnesses. Also,  indi vidual companies know what  they can and  cannot afford, and they should have the flexibility to negotiate an affordable benefits pack age with their employees. Congress does not  have the answer to what works  in each and  every company  throughout America, and we  do not have  the answer to what every em ployee wants. This legislation takes away the  flexibility currently enjoyed by employees and  employers.  Of course we all want companies  to off er  leave  time  to employees  facing health prob lems, taking care of a sick relative, or welcom ing a new baby to their families. We are ignor ing the fact that most of them already do.  In  fact, a poll taken in April 1991 by Gallup and  the National Federation of Independent Busi ness found that well over 90 percent of small  businesses already provide some type of fam ily or medical leave.  However, the mandates contained in H.R. 1  will tie the hands of many businesses, forcing  them  to abide by  the dictates of Congress,  and drive up  their costs. This,  in  turn, will  force many to reduce the number of their em ployees or avoid hiring more. In the long run  this could kill jobs. Obviously, this is not good  for the working men and women of America,  or for the economy.  Another factor we should keep  in mind as  we consider H.R. 1 is America's international  competitiveness. We hear a  lot  these days  about the need to make America more com petitive with  the Europeans, Japanese, and  others. We will not make our companies more  competitive by  loading  them down with an other expensive Federal mandate and taking  away what  flexibility  they have  in managing  their own business, as this legislation will do.  On the contrary, we can make our businesses  more competitive by reducing the costly man dates they already face, and by giving  them  more flexibility. H.R. 1 will  further deteriorate  America's competitiveness.  President Clinton and the Democrats in con trol of Congress have been touting the Family  and Medical Leave Act as evidence of  their  commitment to family values. Family values do  not come  in the form of expensive job-killing  Federal mandates  on  employers.  Families  would be much better served with the flexibility  of employers and workers working together to  come up with benefits which both can accept.  They don't need Congress telling them how to  run their families and businesses.  Voting for H.R. 1 may look appealing, and  it may make Members  feel  like  they have  done something good for families. However, I  hope my colleagues will take a long-term view  of the effect this legislation will have on busi nesses, the economy, and jobs. If you do, you  will vote against H.R. 1.  ",1993
34,House,103,0.231,504,2,Mr. BEREUTER.," Madam Chairman,  the  mandatory  family and medical  leave bill we  are considering today is a seriously flawed bill  that will  cost many Americans  their  jobs;  therefore  this  Member  intends  to  vote  against it.  The measure  coming  before  the House  would require businesses to provide as much  as 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually to any  employee for their own sick leave, for the care  of a sick child, spouse, or parent, and for the  birth or adoption of a child.  Businesses, especially the small businesses  that are  the backbone of this Nation's econ omy, will be hurt by H.R. 1. The National Federation of  Independent Businesses estimates  that it could cost each small business as much  as $12,832.60 per employee per year to com ply with all requirements of the bill. The costs  to small businesses  include  lost productivity,  health insurance costs, higher unemployment  insurance rates, and the expense of interview ing, employing, and training replacement work ers. Those costs could kill small businesses  and  the  jobs  they provide.  It doesn't make  much sense  to  try  to guarantee someone a  job in a business that will be wiped out as a  result of too much Government intrusion.  Madam Chairman,  there  is almost unani mous opposition to this bill among the small  business community in this Member's State. A  letter this Member received  from one of his  constituents who owns a small business illus trates  the problems with  this  legislation and  with the big Government mind set behind the  legislation. This Member would like to read ex cerpts  from a  letter  from  the manager and  owner of one of Lincoln, NE's outstanding  businesses and employers. The letter points to  the difficulties and probable results of this leg islation. This Member's constituent writes:  DEAR CONGRESSMAN BEREUTER: The Family  Leave  scheme,  that  is  expected  to whiz  through the new Congress, will have a mul titude of adverse effects on companies with  50 or more workers. If workers are allowed 12  weeks of family leave and have accrued 3 or  4 weeks of vacation, an employee could pos sibly be away from the workplace a total of  15  to 16 weeks. During  this time the em ployer must keep up their medical, life and  dental insurance, in addition to hiring tem porary workers to replace the employees on  leave and  invest  training expenses  in new  employees that will not be retained in that  position when the employees on leave return.  * * *  Considering the state of our Nation's econ omy one would think that its elected leaders  would consider measures to spur businesses  and therefore promote economic growth. In stead, many elected officials seem hell-bent  on  burdening businesses  to  the breaking  point.  A simple solution to all of these mandated  regulations would be for employers to keep  their work force below the magic 50 number,  but  that goes against  the old American  dream of growth and prosperity. Many em ployers.will, nonetheless, try to cut back on  hiring to meet that magic number.  The government of this country must learn  to look at employers as a vital part of our  nation's economy, not the ""bad guy"". Em ployers care about their employees and their  well being. We are not heartless scoundrels  that take pleasure in our workers' pain and  suffering. We grant leaves of absence to em ployees on an individual basis and many fac tors are considered  in granting  the  leave.  Valuable employees that contribute  to the  company are granted leaves of absence for  many personal reasons  including care of a  new child or sick relative.  Since I consider  the government of this  country to be in ""bankruptcy"", I certainly  don't think that they should be mandating  business policies to those of us that are still  afloat.  Madam Chairman, smaller businesses are  especially hurt by  this kind of  legislation as  they are more  likely to have specialized em ployees. When  those specialized employees  take leave, the business must temporarily re place  them. Currently, businesses have  the  ",1993

36,,103,0.336,517,2,Mr. GOODLING.," Madam Chairman, I  yield myself  such  time  as  I may  consume in closing.  Let me again remind all  that  this  amendment is very tightly written so  that it cannot be abused by any em ployer. This amendment, with the rest  of the legislation, makes sure that an  employer  cannot  take  advantage  of  employees.  But the beauty of the amendment is  that it gives that employee an oppor tunity to choose what they believe is  most important.  Madam Chairman, we had a survey,  several surveys, that indicated that as  much as 73 percent of the employees in  this country do not consider this their  No. 1 item when they talk about bene fits. It is not their No. 2 item. In fact,  Madam Chairman,  it was  not  even  their No. 3 item.  So, this gives an employee the best of  all worlds. It is a win/win situation be cause the employee can select H.R. 1,  the  employee  can  select child  care,  health care, whatever  that employee  wants to choose from  that particular  cafeteria plan.  It is something that, as I  indicated  earlier, is growing rapidly. It is some thing that the employees of this coun try say is in their best interests. It is  something that the employees say they  want to make  the decision on rather  than us making that decision.  So, Madam Chairman, again I say we  are  trying  to perfect legislation that  will be law, and we should not act hast ily simply because  some other body  may have voted some way.  I realize that everything is on a fast  track, but the fast  track is not nec essarily in the best interests of the em ployees of this country or the employ ers.  So, let us think carefully. Let us im prove the bill before we send it to the  President's desk.  ",1993

38,House,103,-0.321,530,2,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr. Speaker, why  is it important  to pass a  family and  medical leave act?  First, it is profamily legislation. It is  prochildren legislation. It is proworker  legislation. And most importantly, it  sends  a  signal  that  the gridlock  in  Washington is over, that one of Presi dent Clinton's campaign promises  is  going  to be enacted and signed  into  law, possibly even this week.  Passage of this legislation recognizes  the reality of working Americans, that  most American families are headed ei ther by two working parents or by sin gle women, and that women are now  the  fastest-growing  segment  of  the  labor market.  Mr. Speaker, Canada, West Germany,  Japan, our major trading partners have  family and medical leave. Why does the  United States not have it? Maybe this  is the reason for our trade deficit and  our  competitiveness  not  being  as  strong as it should be.  Mr. Speaker, I rise  in strong support of the  Family and Medical Leave Act, a bill whose  time has finally come. Having survived con gressional passage and  subsequent vetoes  during  the past two congresses,  the Family  and Medical Leave Act has been, until  re cently, a victim of Washington gridlock. At long  last, Congress will cast its vote on this legisla tion with confidence that  it  is not merely an other empty symbol.  During  the past decade, previous adminis trations  failed  to acknowledge  the dramatic  transformation of America's families and labor  force.  Passage of  the Family  and Medical  Leave Act  recognizes  the  reality of working  Americans: That most American families are  headed either by  two working parents or by  single women and  that women are now  the  fastest growing segment of the  labor market.  According  to  the Labor Department, by  the  year 2005, 50 percent of those entering the  work force will be women.  In the past, those who called for the defeat  of the Family and Medical Leave Act also op erated under the misguided assumption that  establishing certain guarantees for employees  was necessarily in opposition to the economic  well-being of businesses.  Indeed,  this  is not  the case. Some of the benefits of family and  medical  leave  include  increased worker pro ductivity,  decreased  absenteeism,  and  de creased costs of retraining new employees.  It  should come as no surprise that some of our  greatest  trade  partners,  including Canada,  West Germany, and Japan, have family and  medical leave policies already in place.  It  is time to view the work place  in a new  light, one which  responds realistically  to  the  family and medical obligations of the American  work force, while fostering renewed productiv ity and allegiance of workers to their employ ers.  Congressional passage of  the Family and  Medical Leave Act and anticipation that President Clinton will sign  it  into  law mark the es tablishment  of  a  new  covenant  between  Washington and the American public. I strong ly  support  this  legislation and urge my col leagues to do the same.  URGE  CLINTON ADMINISTRATION  TO VETO FAMILY AND MEDICAL  LEAVE ACT  ",1993
39,House,103,0.39,530,2,Mr. KIM.," Mr.  Speaker,  today  the  House considered and passed H.R. 1, the  so-called Family and Medical Leave  Act. I opposed and voted against this  flawed legislation and urge the Clinton  administration to veto it.  Before coming to Congress, I was the  owner of a 130-employee firm. I created  this successful business from scratch.  Like all businessmen, I'm insulted that  through mandates  like  this bill, big,  bureaucratic  government  claims  to  know more about what is best for my  firm  and  its  employees  than  those  workers and I do. That is ridiculous.  We  should  let  the employer and em ployees work it out. This is just more  government interference. And, govern ment is not very good at business. The  Federal Government  itself is over $4  trillion dollars in the red! Any business  run  like government would be bank rupt.  I'm all for improving benefits for em ployees. If a cost-effective way can be  found,  it makes very sound business  sense. I strongly support other incen tives  to businesses  thereby allowing  them  to affordably provide  increased  benefits while remaining competitive.  Mandating such benefits, hurts com petitiveness and job creation.  During  today's debate, my Repub lican colleagues detailed many serious  flaws in H.R. 1.  I agree with many of  their concerns. However,  I would like  to focus on  just  three points at this  time:  First, each employer and each em ployee  have  unique  needs. Dictated  one-size-fits-all Government mandates  do not provide  the necessary flexibil ity.  Family and medical leave is a bene fit. Some businesses already offer it.  Some offer less leave, but more pay.  Some offer flexible schedule or part time work at home with full-time ben efits. What is wrong with all these op tions? This bill could eliminate all of  them.  But, what happens if business slows  down and positions must be cut? If the  business does not hold  that position  open at great cost and wait to termi nate the employee after he or she re turns up to 12 weeks later. Trust me, a  costly lawsuit will follow.  Clearly,  the Government's dictating  an arbitrary 12-week unpaid leave ben efit destroys this important flexibility  for both employee and employer. It at tracts costly  lawsuits. What  is next,  mandated vacation time, lunch hours,  and coffee breaks?  Second, H.R. 1 discriminates against  the millions of Americans who work  for business with less than 50 employ ees. Over 50 percent of American work ers  fall  into  this category. Why dis criminate against  those who do not  work for a Fortune 500 company?  In the interest of fairness and equity,  government should give the right to all  or none.  Third,  this costly benefit discrimi nates against those lower-and middle income workers who  essentially  live  paycheck to paycheck. What is up to 12  weeks unpaid leave to them? Most of us  cannot afford to take off even 1 week  without pay. Why are we protecting  only  a  few  fortunate  employees at  great cost to business?  Does H.R. 1 create more jobs? No, it  may cost many jobs.  Does H.R. 1 promote equal working  standards? No.  It is very discrimina tory and could promote bias against  hiring child-bearing-aged women or for  part-time workers instead.  Does H.R. 1 really benefit employees?  Very few. Most American workers are  not covered by  the act and of  those  who are, most cannot afford the luxury  of 12 weeks off without pay.  Does  H.R.  1  stimulate  economic  growth and enhance competitiveness?  No. It could hurt both by adding new,  costly burdens to business.  Does H.R.  1  increase bureaucracy,  endless  lawsuits,  and  Government  intervention? Yes.  The message  from  the American  voter  this past November was  very  clear. We want an effective economic  growth package that creates real jobs- not time off without pay. It is sad that  H.R. 1-the first bill introduced in Con gress  and  the  first  real  legislation  passed by  the House  this year-does  nothing to help economic growth and  jobs.

This bill  is  identical  to  the  legislation  I  sponsored during  the 101 st and 102d Con gresses.

We have been fortunate to find  in Bramwell some outstanding, and what I be lieve to be nationally significant, historical, cul tural, and architectural values relating  to  the  coal mining heritage of southern West Virginia.  The proposed Bramwell National Historical  Park is envisioned as being a living unit of the  National Park System  in a manner similar to  the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park in  West Virginia. People would continue to make  the area their homes. For this reason, the leg islation makes a number of specific provisions  to protect private property rights: acquisition of  land could only take place with willing sellers  and the National Park Service would not have  access  to private  residential property within  e This ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

41,,103,-0.07,582,2,Mr. JACOBS.," Mr. Speaker, George Will  slams one home again, this time about the na tional pastime of smoke induced suicide.  A NATION'S DISASTROUS SMOKING ADDICTION  (By George F. Will)  WASIDNGTON-At Barnes Hospital  in St.  Louis in 1919 a doctor summoned some medi cal students to an autopsy, saying the pa tient's disease was so rare that most of the  students would never see it again. It was  1 ung cancer.  That story, from Dr. John A. Meyer's arti cle  ""Cigarette Century""  in  the December  American Heritage, illuminates like a light ning flash this fact: much of America's hid eously costly heal th care crisis is caused by  unwise  behavior  associated with  eating,  drinking, driving, sex, alcohol, drugs, vio lence and, especially, smoking. Therefore, fo cusing on wellness-on preventing  rather  than curing illness-will reduce the waste in herent in disease-oriented, hospital-centered,  high-tech medicine. The history of the con nection between cigarettes and lung cancer  illustrates the fallacy of associating health  with the delivery of medicine.  One of those 1919 medical students later  wrote  that he did not see another case of  lung cancer until 1936. Then in six months he  saw nine cases. By the 1930s advances in im munology and public health measures were  reducing the incidence of infectious diseases.  But the nation was about to experience an  epidemic of behaviorally driven disease.  The  lung-cancer epidemic can be said to  have sprung from the 1881 invention of a cig arette-making machine. Prior to that, com mercial manufacturing of cigarettes was,  Meyer says, a cottage industry. But by 1888  North Carolina's James Buchanan Duke  (whose fortune endowed the university) was  selling nearly a billion cigarettes annually.  Next, war, the shaper of our century, worked  its transforming force. Duke's company and  the National Cigarette Service Committee  distributed  cigarettes  free  to  soldiers  in  France during World War I.  Between 1910 and 1919 U.S. cigarette pro duction increased 633 percent from 10 billion  to almost 70 billion annually. Meyer notes  that 0. Henry's meticulously observed short  stories, written at the turn of the century,  almost never mention cigarettes, but the ex patriates  in Hemingway's The Sun Also  Rises smoke constantly. By the 1930s physi cians were struggling with the consequences  of the new, ""emancipated"" behavior.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  In 1930  the lung cancer death rate among  men was less than five per 100,000 per year.  By  the 1950s, after another war  in which  cigarettes were sold for a nickel a pack and  were distributed free  in forward areas and  were included with K rations, the death rate  among men was more  than 20 per 100,000.  Today it is more than 70 per 100,000, women's  lung cancer rates are soaring and lung can cer is far and away America's leading cause  of cancer death.  We have come a  long way from the early  days of television, when the sponsor of an chorman John Cameron Swayze's The Camel  News Caravan required him to have a lit cig arette constantly visible. The aggressiveness  of  today's anti-smoking campaigns  is at tested, paradoxically, by a ""smokers' rights""  movement  trying  to protect from employ ment discrimination those persons who only  smoke away from the job.  The American Cancer Society  is  testing  the  tolerance  of  the magazine  industry,  which last year got $264.4 million-4 percent  of  its  revenue-from  tobacco  advertising.  Some magazines may  flinch  from  running  ACS advertisements that say ""Smoking pro motes zoo breath"" or ""More Americans die  each year from  illness related to smoking  than from heroin, crack, homicide, car acci dents, fires and AIDS combined.""  The social disaster of the smoking addic tion illustrates why behavior modification,  especially education, is the key to cost-con tainment regarding health. And journalism  can help, as the Washington Post's Jay Mat thews deftly demonstrated in his reporting  on the Liggett company's campaign to revive  the Chesterfield brand of cigarettes, a brand  which has not been advertised for decades.  Launched 80 years ago, Chesterfield flour ished when smoking was most glamorous,  from  the  1930s  into  the  1950s, when  the  ""Chesterfield Girl"" was a  television fixture.  Today 50 million addicted Americans still  pay $26 billion for almost half a trillion ciga rettes each year, so if Chesterfield wins one half of 1 percent of the market (2.4 billion  cigarettes), it will be a success.  To achieve that, Liggett is merchandizing  Chesterfields with a $50 million advertising  campaign featuring soft, 1930s-style photog raphy. Matthews  reported  that-and  this,  too:  ""Janet Sackman, who was the Chesterfield  Girl on The Perry Como Show in  the late  1940s, said she was not impressed. She speaks  with difficulty because of surgery for both  throat and lung cancer, which she blames on  33 years of smoking urged by a Chesterfield  executive who thought she would look more  authentic, 'People who smoke ought to take  a look at me,' she said.""  And at the trajectory of the epidemic from  1919 until now.  TRIBUTE TO JUSTICE THURGOOD  MARSHALL  HON. WUISE McINTOSH SIAUGHfER  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 3, 1993  ",1993
42,,103,-0.465,582,2,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker,  to com memorate Black History Month  in  the past,  I  paid tribute to Frederick Douglas, a man who  lived in Rochester, NY, and published his abo litionist newspaper, the North Star to help lead  the  fight against slavery. This year,  I would  like to pay tribute to one of the greatest leadFebruary 3, 1993  ers in the history of the civil rights movement,  Justice Thurgood Marshall.  It was with great sadness that America re cently bid farewell to justice Marshall, a tower ing man who utilized his formidable skills as a  lawyer and a judge  to obtain  liberation and  justice from the same legal system which had  been used for centuries to deny rights to Afri can-Americans. On the day he lay in state at  the U.S. Supreme Court, over 20,000 people  filed past his flag-draped coffin to pay their re spects to a man whose  legacy made this a  better Nation for all Americans.  Thurgood Marshall was born  in Baltimore,  MD,  in 1908. At  that  time, Baltimore was a  segregated city which meant  that  the public  schools Marshall could attend, the restaurants  he could frequent, and even the rest rooms he  could use were determined by the color of his  skin. Despite  these  restrictions which made  African-Americans  second-class  citizens  in  their  own  country, Marshall  remained  un daunted and committed himself  to  receiving  the best education that he could. With assist ance  from  his parents and  the wages he  earned working  several  jobs, Marshall  at tended Lincoln University.  When he graduated from college, he wanted  to become a lawer, but was denied entrance  to the University of Maryland Law School be cause he was black. Marshall, however, would  ultimately have the last laugh. After graduating  magna cum  laude and  first  in his class from  Howard University Law School  in 1933, he  took and won a case which overturned  the  racist admissions policy of  the University of  Maryland Law School. In 1935, the first black  student was admitted to the formerly all-white  institution. Marshall later said of this case, ""I  enjoyed it to no end.""  During his early years as a lawyer, Marshall  was a tireless and successful advocate of civil  rights  first with  the Baltimore chapter of  the  NAACP, and  then as  the primary strategist  and chief counsel of  the NAACP Legal De fense Fund. His record as a litigator before the  Supreme Court was truly impressive; he won  29 of the 32 cases he tried.  The case which brought him  the greatest  national  attention was  the  1954 Supreme  Court case Brown versus Board of Education.  The 1896 decision rendered in Plessy versus  Ferguson claimed that the shameful policy of  segregation was  legal so  long as  institutions  remained ""separate but equal."" Marshall pow erfully and passionately argued before  the  court that ""separate educational  facilities are  inherently unequal"" and  the  justices unani mously agreed. The historic importance of the  Brown case cannot be overstated.  It marked  the beginning of the end of apartheid  in  the  United States,  and  according  to Marshall,  ""*      probably did more than anything else  to awaken the Negro from this apathy to de manding his right to equality.""  Marshall did not stop with this decision, and  he continued  to battle discriminatory housing  and electoral statues. Given his tenacity and  success, he was known at home and abroad  as Mr. Civil Rights.  In  the late 1950's, many  African-Americans considered Thurgood Mar shall and Dr. Martin Luther King to be the two  most important civil rights leaders in the coun try.  In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Mar shall to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals,  ",1993
43,,103,-0.216,595,2,Mr. CLEMENT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  introduce  legislation which addresses an  im portant  issue  related  to highway safety and  the role of illicit drug use along our Nation's  highway system.  Despite extensive  initiatives,  illegal use of  drugs continues at an alarming rate across our  Nation. Unfortunately,  it has become popular  for drug pushers to distribute many of these  narcotics at truck stop facilities and highway  rest areas. These areas are defined as loca tions where drivers frequently stop for fuel, ve hicle maintenance,  relaxation, and  rest. The  National Association of Truck Stop Operators  estimates that drug use or distribution occurs  at approximately 50 percent of these areas.  During the 101 st Congress, and again dur ing the 102d Congress, I introduced the Drug  Free Truck Stop Act. This  legislation estab lishes drug-free zones around truck stops and  highway rest areas, and  it mandates, for the  first  time, minimum penalties and  increases  the maximum  penalties and  increases  the  maximum penalties for distribution or posses sion with intent to distribute illegal drugs at or  within 1,000 feet of these areas.  Specifically,  the Drug Free Truck Stop Act  designates truck stops and highway rest areas  along  our Nation's  highways as  drug-free  zones. Under this legislation, a first-time drug  offense would establish a minimum  jail sen tence of 1 year. The legislation then doubles  the maximum sentence for first time offenses  and triples the penalties for a second offense  occurring in the drug-free zone.  During  the 101 st Congress,  I offered  the  Drug Free Truck Stop Act as an amendment  during House consideration of  the Omnibus  Crime bill. While  the amendment passed on  voice vote, it was subsequently dropped from  the final conference report.  During  the 1 02d Congress.  I reintroduced  the Drug Free Truck Stop Act. When  the  House of Representatives considered the Om2113  nibus Crime Bill, I offered the Drug Free Truck  Stop Act as an amendment. By a  recorded  vote of 371-48, the amendment passed and  was included in this legislation. Despite over whelming support for the amendment, the Om nibus Crime bill was not enacted by the 102d  Congress.  Mr. Chairman, the effort to reclaim these fa cilities will make our Nation's highways safer  for everyone while  further discouraging  the  flow of  illegal drugs  in our communities. By  making America's  rest stops safer, we also  offer those fatigued drivers a protected area to  relax, an effort which will surely decrease the  number of traffic fatalities in our national high way system.  This legislation is supported by the National  Association  of Truck Stop Operators,  the  American Trucking Association,  the National  Private Truck Council,  the Owner-Operated  Independent Drivers Association, and the Pro fessional Truck Drivers Institute of America.  I urge my colleagues to support this worth while legislation.  TRIBUTE TO ED BRADLEY  HON. WCIEN E. BLACKWEil  OF PENNSYLVANIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, February 3, 1993  ",1993
44,,103,-0.538,595,2,Mr. BLACKWELL.," Mr. Speaker,  I am ex tremely delighted to stand here today to pay  tribute to Mr. Ed Bradley, an exceptional gen tleman who  is well respected for his extraor dinary accomplishments and contributions  in  the field of media broadcasting.  Born in Philadelphia, as the only child of Ed ward and Gladys Bradley, Ed Bradley has  long been known for his ability to boldly face  any challenge that is set before him with pro fessionalism and vigor.  In 1959, he entered Cheyney State College  as an education major. In addition to his inter est in the field of education, Bradley also ex hibited a profound enthusiasm  in  the area of  media  broadcast.  In  the  early  1960's he  worked as an unpaid news reporter and disc  jockey at WDAS-FM  in Philadelphia whereby  he made a remarkable contribution.  Upon  graduation  from Cheyney, Bradley  began his teaching career in a Philadelphia el ementary  school. While  teaching  the  sixth  grade in  the 1960's, he became  increasingly  interested in events that took place during the  historic civil rights movement. As a result, he  utilized his  journalistic  talents and spent 48  hours covering the race riots in Philadelphia.  Following that event, he divided his time be tween teaching, working as a disc jockey, and  as a news reporter. In 1967, Bradley made the  decision to become a news reporter on a full time basis. He vigorously sought out to begin  his career by applying  for a job with WCBS  radio in New York.  Many say  that  the secret  to Ed Bradley's  success has a lot to do with his honesty, inno vative style, and commitment  to quality pro ductions.  In 1971 he joined CBS News as a stringer  in the Paris Bureau. By September 1972, he  was reassigned  to Southeast Asia where he  covered the Vietnam war as a television cor",1993
45,,103,-0.223,647,2,Mr. KERREY.," Mr. President,  I am  pleased to rise today in support of the  Family and Medical Leave Act. I am a  cosponsor of this legislation and firmly  believe in the need for this reform. I  support family leave both as a parent  and  as  an  employer  and  small  businessowner.  As a parent,  I  feel  the pull, as do  many people, between the demands of  work and needs of family. My support  for family leave legislation reflects an  appreciation of the changing realities  of a workplace which must accommo date  increasing numbers of working  families. Women today, including mil lions of mothers with small children,  are entering the work force in ever in creasing numbers.  Nationwide,  less than 10 percent of  families are made up of married cou ples with children where the husband is  the  sole provider.  In  fact,  the work  force  in  the 1990's is 45.5 percent fe male, and women with young children  comprise the majority of new entrants.  In my own State of Nebraska, 71.1 per cent  of  all mothers with  children  younger than 6 are in the work force.  Nebraska, in fact, has the highest per centage of any State, of working par ents caring for children younger than  6. This amounts to 85,000 children ages  birth to 5 with mom and dad working.  In addition to their children, millions  of working people must also assume re sponsibility for their parents. Accord ing to the American Medical Associa tion,  for every patient  in a nursing  home,  there are  three more severely  impaired patients being cared  for at  home. In light of this country's lack of  long-term care policy, supporting fam ily members who must  temporarily  care for the elderly or disabled is criti cal.  As  a  businessowner,  I  understand  that healthy small companies are an  essential part of our Nation's economy.  Because small companies comprise 94.2  percent of Nebraska's business commu nity. they are especially important to  the health of Nebraska's economy. In  the midst of recession, small business  acted as a driving force behind the lim ited economic growth we experienced.  Between 1988 and 1990, 100 percent of  the net new jobs in Nebraska were cre ated by  small businesses. For  these  reasons, I have supported flexibility in  the implementation of the Family and  Medical Leave Act.  The legislation we are currently con sidering contains numerous provisions  to ease the impact on small business.  For example, it covers only those em ployers with 50  or more  employees.  This provision alone exempts 95 per cent of U.S. business and half of all  workers. In addition,  this bill covers  only those employees who have worked  for over 1 year and who work an aver age of more than 25 hours per week.  Further,  the bill allows employers to  exclude their highest paid 10 percent of  employees.  Despite the limited scope of this bill,  I believe its passage is crucial for one  very  important  reason:  The United  States has a responsibility to promote  the values we hold in common as a Na tion. It is clear that we have been ne glecting the very people who comprise  the  backbone  of  this  country,  our  working  families. Our greatest com petitors, Germany and Japan both leg islate parental leave. Japan provides 12  weeks during which workers are paid 60  percent of  their normal salary. Ger many provides up to 26 weeks and for  workers taking 14-19 weeks, pays them  full salary during that time.  I am very concerned, however, that  the act be  implemented in a  respon sible fashion. Good intentions become  meaningless when Government, in de termining regulations,  turns intended  benefits into unintended burdens. The  ",1993

47,Senate,103,0.39,660,2,Mr. LOTT.," Mr. President, I want to  thank the distinguished Senator from  Indiana for yielding me this time and  also for  the very fine and  thoughtful  statement he has made both today and  in the past on this subject. He has done  a good job, and we appreciate his lead ership on this issue.  As we  listen  to  this debate across  America, one of the things that comes  to my mind is who should we really be  listening  to? There are many elected  officials and there are many military  men  and women who  certainly  are  going to be very thoughtful in their re marks. But who should we listen more  to  than  the most  respected military  leaders we have in America today? We  have  a  national hero  in Gen. Colin  Powell,  the Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs of Staff. We have all admired  him for  the  job he has done,  for  the  things that he stands for,  the  job he  has done in that position. Let us listen  to just two of his quotes on the subject:  It's my  judgment,  the  judgment of  the  Joint Chiefs, that homosexual behavior is in consistent with maintaining good order and  discipline.  With regard to the question of race,  and certainly he feels especially sen sitive to this question, he said in the  text of a letter to Representative PAT  SCHROEDER in 1992 this:  Skin color is a benign, nonbehavioral char acteristic. Sexual orientation is perhaps the  most profound of human behavioral charac teristics. Comparison of the two is a conven ient but invalid argument.  Gen. Carl Mundy, Commandant of  the U.S. Marine Corps, said just in De cember 1992:  I do support the ban against homosexuals  in  the military. I believe  that homosexual  conduct,  that  the gay  lifestyle  embodies  those things that are contrary to good order  and discipline in the military.  That  is what  two of  the most  re spected military men  in  the world  today had to say on this issue.  Before  I get  into  some more  sub stance, I want to emphasize one point,  and I am sure our distinguished leader,  BOB DOLE, will emphasize this later on.  A lot of people are going to look at this  debate and look at the procedure and  they are going  to say what is really  going on? Let me make it clear. After  3 days of struggling,  the Republicans  have  secured  from  the Democratic  leader an opportunity to have a vote on  this issue. But let us make clear what  that vote is.  ",1993

51,Senate,103,0.213,751,2,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President, when  the Senate returns from its February  recess, I intend to introduce the Rural  Rail Infrastructure Act of 1993. Today,  I will offer a general outline of this im portant policy  issue.  I urge my col leagues to review my remarks, and I  welcome their thoughts and ideas.  Rural America has suffered a decline  that has been accelerated by Govern ment policy, or to be frank, the lack of  a policy. This is particularly true with  respect to rural transportation. Trans portation companies have divested in  rural America because  business  and  capital have not been there to support  the  infrastructure. Deregulation has  accelerated this decline with a severe  loss of air, rail, and bus service.  In other areas involving basic infra structure, Congress has moved boldly  to address the needs of small States.  The Rural Electric Administration pro vides power and  telephone service  to  the most remote regions of America.  The Interstate Highway System con nects our small cities and towns, and  continues  to  be  the  lifeline of our  freight  trucking industry. The Essen tial Air Service Program is a modest  but vital component of small city air  service. We also are seeing efforts to  reestablish small city bus links.  Rail, however, is the transportation  mode that was left behind. The abandonment of small State rail service has  been massive. As a result, economic development options are reduced, and entire communities lose industrial opportunities. In areas like my home State  of South Dakota, it is becoming more  and more difficult to move our bountiful harvests from the field to the American table and markets abroad.

The  senior Senator  from  Nebraska [Mr. EXON] and the Senator  from  Iowa  [Mr. HARKIN]  and others  have worked diligently in the U.S. Sen ate  to restore quality rail service  to  small  States. We  reestablished  the  Local  Freight Assistance  Program,  after it was killed in the early 1980's.  That  program  provides modest  but  vital help at a  level of about $10 mil lion each year. On two occasions, the  Senate approved as much as $100 mil lion  in Federal  loan guarantees  for  light density  lines. However, House Senate  conference  committees  dra matically  reduced  the  Senate's  recommenations.  The 40,000 miles of local and regional  railroads are America's most vulner able  transport  infrastructure. Mean while, we are making funding  to our  highways  that will  total $130 billion  over the next few years.  We  are making  commitments  to  mass transit. We are making commit ments to Amtrak. High-speed rail is a  high priority. I support all of these ini tiatives. All reflect our desire to rein vest in America. However, reinvesting  in America means reinvesting in rural  America. It means reinvesting in South  Dakota, and other States from Mon tana to Maine.  Mr. President, it is time for our Na tion to make an equal commitment to  rural rail infrastructure. My proposed  legislation is based on existing law. My  legislation will not create any new pro grams or  layers of bureaucracy.  In stead, it combines and builds on cur rent statutes. My legislation will con sist of the following:  I. LOCAL RAIL FREIGHT ASSISTANCE  II. AUTHORIZE RAILROAD LOAN GUARANTEES  ing rural rail infrastructure to a safe  and viable condition.  The Regional Railroads of America  [RRA]  recently presented me with a  policy proposal  entitled  the  ""Green  Map."" The RRA Green Map provides  excellent justification for  the  legisla tive package I am developing for rural  America. I bring it to the attention of  each of my colleagues and ask that it  be printed in the RECORD at the conclu sion of my remarks.  There being no objection, the mate rial was ordered to be printed in the  RECORD, as follows:  REGIONAL RAILROADS OF AMERICA, THE GREEN  MAP PROGRAM  INTRODUCTION  Railroads safely move people and freight  using less energy, relieving highway conges tion and  lowering pollution. If 10% of the  freight moving by truck were diverted to rail  we would reduce emissions of carbon dioxide  by 2.46 million tons, save 200 million gallons  of fuel and eliminate 220 highway fatalities a  year.  Highway congestion today wastes two bil lion hours and costs $100 billion in lost wages  and excess fuel consumption each year. Air  passengers sit through 20,000 hours of flight  delays, costing us some $5 billion in wasted  time and fuel. Over 100 suburban areas fail to  meet Clean Air standards. Sixty eight cities  fail  pollution goals  for ozone. Almost as  many can't meet carbon monoxide guide lines. Some 150 million Americans live where  the air quality in unacceptable.  Unlike our gridlocked highways and air ports, the existing rail system can carry four  times today's traffic. Railroads could in fact,  take 10 million trucks off the highways with out laying another mile of  track. With a  modest investment, high speed rail service  could be initiated over existing rights of way  between city pairs of 400 miles or less. This  could eliminate  the need for  thousands of  daily flights between near-by metropolitan  areas.  Taken  together,  the  rail commuter and  rail freight lines of this country comprise a  Green Map that can make a major contribu tion to the environmental, energy and trans portation goals of this country.  Unfortunately,  the  totality  of  federal  transportation policy and the federal funding  that supports that policy enhances the Grey  Map of highways.  The basis of that federal policy is an enor mous Tax Gap between railroads and their  modal competitors. The Tax Gap is created  by two factors. First, the government under charges the trucking and barge industries for  the construction and repair of their rights of  way. Second,  the government overcharges  the railroad industry by imposing billions of  dollars  in unique costs for  federally man dated railroad retirement, FELA and labor  protection.  The Federal Tax Gap is the fundamental  problem for our industry. It is the reason  railroads continue to lose market share as  measured by revenue. It is the reason rail roads rank near the bottom among 21  indus try groups when measuring return on invest ment. It is the reason rail industry jobs have  shrunk by half in a decade.  For regional railroads this problem is par ticularly acute. Regional Railroads are small  start-up companies that cannot absorb the  financial penalties imposed on it by bad pub lic policy.

52,Senate,103,-0.308,777,2,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to cosponsor S. 309,  the Rural  Jobs and Investment Act of 1993, intro duced  today by my friend  the senior  Senator from Vermont [Mr. LEAHY]. He  properly signals, with this legislation,  the need to include rural America in  our  efforts  to  stimulate  economic  growth and the creation of new jobs.  The legislation also demonstrates an  appreciation for the larger, longer term  economic problem we face, the Federal  budget deficit,  by providing  for  full  funding  of  the  proposed  legislation  with spending cuts.  That feature is key and essential.  If we are ever to make progress in re ducing our budget deficit, new appro priations must be funded by equal or  greater cuts in spending or increased  revenues or both.  Mr. President, I want to emphasize  that  I  fully  support  this  legislation  with its offsetting cuts from existing  programs.  I also want  to underscore  my own strong feeling that we need to  proceed with deficit reduction.  Indeed, I strongly prefer, and may at  some point offer,  language which re quires additional deficit reduction as a  condition of the new spending in any  economic stimulus legislation. Beyond  what  is  accomplished  in  this  bill,  namely  funding  the  spending  levels  outlined in it, such a provision would  require  additional  deficit  reduction  through either spending cuts or reve nue increases.  Mr. President, we must proceed with  deficit reduction at the same time we  pursue efforts  to stimulate the econ omy. Failure to do so dooms the short term effort, and makes the longer term  problem that much more difficult.  Recent economic  forecasts  indicate  that the deficit is even worse than it  was through to be  just a  few months  ago. Our economy  suffers under  its  weight. It diverts needed private cap ital away from job-creating investment  into Government  debt;  it  restricts  growth in national productivity; it de nies future generations the ability to  shape  their Government  and  their  economy.  Fully  funding  new  appropriations  may not worsen the deficit, but neither  does it reduce it, and being deficit neu tral is not enough.  Mr. President, as the body considers  various  packages  to  stimulate  the  economy,  I will  support efforts  that  fully fund those packages, and that go  beyond that to lower the Federal defi cit. In addition, though, I will support  and join in efforts that seek to lower  the deficit directly.  In  recognizing  that  the  economy  needs  targeted stimulation, we must  also bf: mindful that the deficit is the  overriding problem  facing our econ omy.  Mr. President, having said that, we  must also note  that much of rural  America is suffering. One out of every  four children living in our rural com m uni ties lives in poverty and 1 out of  10  rural Americans  is  unemployed.  Rural Americans  and  their  commu",1993
53,Senate,103,-0.334,790,2,Mr. WOFFORD.," Mr.  President, on  March 15  the Base Realignment and  Closure commission will announce its  next  round  of  recommendations  for  base closures across the United States.  Notably absent from that list will be  any of the hundreds of bases the United  States maintains overseas.  The legislation I'm introducing today  requires  that  the Base Realignment  and Closure Commission include over seas military bases when it makes its  next recommendations in 1993 and 1995.  It simply says that decisions to close  bases should not be made without look ing at all our bases-including those in  Europe, Asia and elsewhere.  Every year, the United States spends  more than $50 billion to subsidize the  defense of our most prosperous and eco nomically  competitive  allies. That's  three time more than the Federal Gov ernment spends on  the education of  American children each year.  During  the  long years of  the Cold  War-when hundreds of  thousands of  troops were lined up against us in the  East-it made  sense  to maintain  a  large system of bases in Western Eu rope. But  the Warsaw Pact has dis solved, the Berlin Wall has fallen, the  Soviet Union  no  longer exists. The  threat of a major, surprise ground at tack no longer exists. We must adjust  our military to meet these new reali ties.  Our  national  security  needs  have  changed since  the  fall of  the Soviet  Union. The crisis in Bosnia and the re lief mission in Somalia reinforce  the  fact that American forces have new a  new mission  in  the post-cold war  world-peacekeeping, humanitarian re lief and protection of minorities. To do  this, we must maintain a flexible, mo bile force that is capable of being inte grated with the forces of our allies.  ",1993
54,Senate,103,0.068,816,2,Mr. SPECTER.," Mr. President, I am  today  introducing  legislation  to pro vide for a private right of action for in jured parties  to  sue  in  the Federal  court to stop goods from coming into  this country which are subsidized or  dumped or  in violation of our  trade  laws. We have a very serious problem  in many industries-steel, coal, glass,  and many others-affecting the coun try as a whole, and particularly my  home State of Pennsylvania.  We have too long sacrificed American  industry and American  jobs  in  the  name of foreign policy, defense policy,  without having the proper enforcement  of  the  laws  because  the  executive  branch, whether it is a Republican ad ministration or a Democratic adminis tration, has made concessions for for eign policy and defense interests.  The problem  is  illustrated by  the  timetable which has been established  on complaints filed by the steel indus try, where  finally,  last month,  the  Commerce Department  issued its ini tial determination that imports of cer tain steel products from 19 countries  are being sold in the United States for  less than fair value.  The details are set forth in my state ment which I shall have included at the  close  of my  extemporaneous  com ments.  But the fact is it will take about a  year and a half for any kind of a deter mination, and then the determination  is totally inadequate because the losses  sustained by the American steel indus try are not compensated.  What is necessary is that a private  injured party-a company, a union, any  one who  is  injured-have an oppor tunity to go into Federal court, very  much as private prosecutors do in tre ble damage actions under the antitrust  laws, and seek enforcement of Ameri ca's trade  laws, which are currently  not being adequately enforced by the  executive branch.  I believe in free trade. But free trade  means  the cost of production plus a  reasonable profit.  It does not mean  that a foreign government ought to be  able to subsidize a ton of steel, for ex ample, up to $250 a ton. Free trade does  not mean that foreign importers ought  to be able to dump goods in the United  States where  that  happens  so  fre quently.  Steel  producers  in Brazil,  Japan, or Taiwan will sell steel in the  United States at a price lower than the  price which it is being sold  in  their  home market.  Mr. President, this is a matter of fun damental  fairness; Too  often,  thou sands,  tens of thousands, hundreds of  thousands of American jobs have been  lost  through unfair  foreign  competi tion.  Mr. President, today I am again in troducing legislation to provide a pri vate right of action for injured parties  to sue in Federal court to stop imports  from coming  into  the United States  which are subsidized or dumped. This is  an issue that I have strenuously pur sued throughout my career here in the  Senate. Because I do not believe that  foreign policy or defense policy con cerns should supersede basic fairness in  trade policy, I am continuing my ef forts today.  I have long been concerned about the  importation of subsidized or dumped  goods on the U.S. market and its im pact on U.S. jobs and industries. While  it is encouraging to note the announce ment on January 27, 1993, by the Com merce Department of their preliminary  determination in favor of the U.S. steel  industry, this announcement nonethe less highlights  the primary problem  confronted by U.S.  industries seeking  relief from unfair competition under  U.S. trade laws-namely, that they are  completely dependent on the U.S. Gov ernment, which may place other con cerns, such as foreign relations, ahead  of trade issues.  Even when the Government does act  aggressively to enforce U.S. trade laws,  the process is extremely time consum ing. The U.S. steel industry is a perfect  example. In April, 1992,  the voluntary  restraint agreements were allowed  to  lapse and the industry filed its dump ing actions with the Commerce Depart ment. Nearly 10 months later, on Janu ary 27, 1993, the Commerce Department  issued its initial determination-a pre liminary determination-that imports  of certain steel products from 19 coun tries  are  being  sold  in  the United  States at less than fair value. I am ad vised that the Department expects to  make its final determination by April  12,  1993,  1 year  later,  regarding  six  countries and by mid-June, 14 months  later,  for all other countries. If the  final determination affirms  the pre liminary  determination,  the  Inter national Trade Commission [ITC] will  then have 45 days to determine wheth er  the  imports materially  injure, or  threaten to injure, the U.S. steel indus try. If the ITC finds injury or threat of  injury, the Commerce Department will  instruct the Customs Service to collect  antidumping duties.  Assuming that all decisions are fa vorable, this means that the steel in dustry will have waited for more than  a year before any action was taken to  remedy the injury done  to U.S. steel  companies and their workers. And even  then,  the remedy will be prospective,  and it in no real way will compensate  them for  the actual damages of lost  jobs and lost revenues. Therefore, it is  my strong belief that a private right of  action is necessary to enable our do mestic  industries  to counter  foreign  subsidies, dumping, and customs fraud  in a  timely manner. My bill accom plishes this by authorizing immediate  injunctive relief against the offending  foreign exporter to prevent the illegal  import from causing further damage,  and it allows for the recovery of dam ages incurred as a result of the illegal  import.  The essence of free  trade is selling  goods at a price equal to the cost of  production  and  a  reasonable  profit.  Where you have subsidies by foreign  ",1993
55,Senate,103,-0.319,829,2,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to join with Senator STEVENS in  introducing  the  Emerging  Tele communications Technologies Act of  1993. This legislation is essential to the  promotion of  the U.S.  telecommuni cations infrastructure. It is my hope  that  this  legislation  can  be  passed  quickly this year.  This bill will transfer 200 megahertz  of spectrum from  the control of the  Federal Government  to  the Federal  Communications Commission [FCC] to  make available for new  technologies.  The bill  requires  the National Tele communications and Information Ad ministration  [NTIA]  to consult with  the Department of Defense, other Gov ernment users, and the private sector  to  determine which  frequencies  are  most suitable to be transferred.  This bill is a slightly revised version  of the bill I introduced last year, S. 218.  Senator STEVENS  and  I  have  incor porated some changes to accommodate  concerns of the amateur radio  indus try.  I  am  happy  to  include  these  changes in order to protect the rights  of amateur radio users to their spec trum.  The other major difference with last  year's bill is the addition of language  that would permit FCC  to conduct a  test  of  spectrum  auctions.  I  have  worked closely with Senator STEVENS  to draft this prov1s10n  in a way that  will protect the public's interest in and  ownership of the spectrum. Although  spectrum  auctions  have  been  con troversial  in the past,  I believe it is  time  to  consider  using  auctions  to  speed up the process of issuing commu nications  licenses. Let me also  say,  however, that I will continue to work  with interested parties on this bill to  work out any remaining problems they  may have.  REALLOCATION OF 200 MEGAHERTZ  This iegislation is enormously impor tant to the future of U.S. economic de velopment. The Chairman of the Fed eral Communications Commission has  testified that, ""the availability of spec trum also has a direct bearing on the  performance and global  competitive ness of one of our major, and fastest  growing, manufacturing industries, in dustrial and commercial electronics.""  Wireless communications are becom ing essential  to a  fast-paced, on-the move society. Businessmen and women  often need to have a  fax, phone, and  computer available  to  them wherever  they may be  in order  to  respond  to  marketplace  developments. Wireless  communications also benefit  residen tial customers, the elderly, rural citi zens, and others for whom a stationary,  wired link to the telephone network is  either costly or unworkable. For  in stance, some handicapped persons find  it difficult to get to a telephone and in stead prefer to carry a portable tele phone with them. In rural areas, wire less communications links may be the  cheapest way to provide service.  The problem is that today  there is  not enough spectrum to make available  for these new technologies. Three years  ago,  Businessweek magazine  ran  a  cover story entitled, ""Airwave Wars:  The Communications Spectrum Is Too  Crowded. So How Do We Make Room  For All Those New Technologies?"". Ac cording to the FCC, various applicants  have already placed  requests  for 600  megahertz of spectrum to be allocated  for new technologies.  Almost all observers agree that the  Federal Government does not make  full use of a substantial number of fre quencies. Of course, some of these fre quencies must remain clear for defense,  emergency and public safety purposes.  This bill in no way seeks to downgrade  the importance of these essential serv ices. Other  frequencies, however, are  not used  for emergency services and  could be used more efficiently by the  commercial sector.  By transferring 200 MHZ to the FCC  for new technologies, this bill attempts  to address  some of  this demand  for  spectrum. The bill leaves to the Com mission the important question of de ciding how these new frequencies will  be allocated and assigned. This bill ex presses no opinion on which particular  members of the public should be award ed the right to operate over these new  ",1993
56,Senate,103,-0.397,868,2,Mr. SIMON.," Mr.  President,  I  am  pleased to announce today in the Sen ate, as well as the House, that we are  introducing  a  constitutional  amend ment which will  require  a  balanced  budget unless there is a 60-percent vote  of Congress  to  the  contrary.  I  am  pleased to say that so far we have 11  Democrats as cosponsors and 11 Repub licans as cosponsors. The cosponsors on  the  Democratic  side  are  Senator  DECONCINI,  Senator HEFLIN,  Senator  BRYAN,  Senator  DASCHLE,  Senator  SHELBY,  Senator KRUEGER,  Senator  KOHL, Senator MOSELEY-BRAUN,  Sen ator MATHEWS,  Senator NIGHTHORSE  CAMPBELL. On the Republican side, the  chief cosponsor is Senator HATCH. The  other Republican Senators are Senator  THuRMOND, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator  BROWN, Senator COHEN, Senator PRES SLER, Senator CRAIG, Senator BENNETT'  Senator SMITH, Senator KEMPTHORNE  and Senator NICKLES.  Thomas  Jefferson was not  in  the  United States when  the Constitution  was written. He was in France. When  he came back, he said, ""If I could add  one amendment to the Constitution, it  would be to prohibit the Federal Gov ernment  from borrowing  funds."" He  said, ""We should consider ourselves un authorized to saddle posterity with our  debts and morally bound to pay them  ourselves."" As  in  so many  things,  Thomas  Jefferson was  ahead of his  time.  What is the problem today? The prob lem today, Mr. President,  is that we  are spending $800 million-more  than  $800 million-every  day  on  interest  that does absolutely nothing for us. In  1980, we spent $74 billion as our gross  interest expenditure. This year the cur rent estimate is $307 billion. The CBO  reported to us just the other day that  the current estimate on our deficit is  $310 billion, and if we do not have some  dramatic changes, 10 years from now,  it will be $650 billion and 35 percent of  the revenue of the Federal Government  will go for debt service. That is assum ing that there is not an increase in in terest rates. That is the best case sce nario. We have  to get a hold of this  problem.  The New York Federal Reserve Board  says that the deficit in the 1980's cost  us, in loss of savings, 5 percent loss in  GNP, in national income. One percent,  according to CBO, is 650,000  jobs. That  means the deficit of the 1980's cost us  over 3 million jobs. I cannot tell you  how many of those jobs were in Illinois  or Minnesota or Texas, but a  lot of  them were. We  just cannot continue  this. We have to face up to this.  ",1993
57,House,103,0.478,920,2,Mr. DREIER.," Mr. Speaker, the Joint  Committee on the Organization of Con gress this morning heard very eloquent  testimony  from  the gentleman  from  Sanibel, FL. He is the newest member  of the Committee on Rules.  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Florida  [Mr. Goss].  ",1993
58,House,103,0.421,920,2,Mr. GOSS.," Mr. Speaker, I thank the  distinguished  gentleman  from  Pasa dena and environs for his generous re marks.  Mr. Speaker, for the second time in  as many days we are faced with a re strictive rule, which forces us to waive  the 3-day requirement and shuts out  important amendments even though we  are certainly not under any sort of  time constraint. In fact, for the second  time in 2 days this body is acting on a  timetable that seems designed to suit  the press needs of the new administra tion at the expense of the legislative  needs of the Nation. Some might claim  that gridlock is over. I would say the  wheels have been greased with some  pretty slippery stuff. Mr. Speaker, the  so-called motor-voter bill  before  us  today is destined to cause trouble-not  just because it sets up a system power less to fend off massive fraud, but be cause it imposes enormous costs on our  State and local governments-many of  which are suffering under the burden of  budget shortfalls, just as we are here in  Washington. Unfunded Federal man dates have become a popular tool for  Federal  legislators-eager  to  impose  new social programs but unwilling to  set priorities and make spending cuts  to support their projects. Motor-voter,  which is estimated to cost my State of  Florida $6.4 million to  implement,  is  another  example  of  this  dangerous  trend. The  annual  cost,  across  the  country, could climb  to $250 million.  We cannot claim to be serious about  fiscal responsibility in one breath and  pass such an irresponsible, costly bill  in another. Then there is the very seri ous problem of voter fraud-this bill  practically invites it. Can you imagine  an illegal alien, applying for a driver's  license-and, as the high-profile case of  Zoe Baird demonstrates, likely getting  one-actively calling attention  to his  or herself by declaring that he or she  does not want to register to vote? In  this bill, unless you affirmatively say  ""No  thanks,"" you will automatically  become  registered. Making matters  worse, this bill provides for no reason able means for States to purge voter  rolls to remove ineligible people. This  bill limits a State's ability to preserve  the integrity of its voter registration  process through independent confirma tion of  information given by appli cants. Mr. Speaker, as was  the case  yesterday,  there  were many  good  amendments proposed to correct some  of this bill's most egregious problems.  And,  as we  saw  yesterday,  those  amendments were defeated in the Rules  Committee on  an almost automatic  party line vote. It is becoming clear to  this Member  that,  for  the majority  leadership, ending gridlock means lim iting the rights of the minority while  depriving this House and the people it  represents of the right to fully debate  and consider the issue. Our system of  open government is rapidly giving way  to autocratic, one-party rule. As you  yourself said, Mr. Speaker, the major ity party makes no pretense of being  fair when it comes to the Rules Com mittee and bringing legislation to the  floor. Especially when we are consider ing  legislation  that directly  affects  Americans' most basic  right of rep resentation according to the one-man,  one-vote principle, this is a real trag edy  for democracy.  I  urge my  col leagues-and especially  the  110  new  Members sent here on a wave of voter  anger and desire for change-to defeat  the previous question so we can open  up this process and improve this bill.

60,House,103,-0.491,920,2,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, today is a great day for  the House, because today we will take  a great step for democracy by passing  the motor-voter legislation. I commend  the gentleman from Washington  SWIFT] and the other members of the  committee who have worked so hard to  bring this bill to the floor. It has come  over and over, and most of the Mem bers know what is in the bill. Our col league, Mr. FROST, has laid it out, and  I commend him for his efforts on behalf  of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to say, and  my time allotment does not allow me  to go into the details of the bill, and as  I say, the gentleman from Texas [Mr.  FROST] has already spelled them out,  but I did want to say, in the words of  some  other  people, what  this  bill  means.  It is important to me as a  former  State Chair in California, faced with  the difficulties of registering voters, I  found that the Government in fact not  only did not do its share, but in fact it  was delinquent, it was derelict in its  duties in removing obstacles to partici pation.  Some of our colleagues have men tioned the cost involved in this legisla tion. It has been estimated that while  there are some startup costs, there are  offsets that estimate a savings of up to  [Mr.  $7 million  to  $10 million,  because  motor-voter and agency-based registra tion saves money by distributing voter  registration over the year and allowing  elected officials  to  save  the cost of  temporary workers during peak  reg istration periods.  The States will save another $4 mil lion annually in reduced postal rates,  and motor-voter, which will be the pri mary method of registration, is cheap er than any other technique to register  voters.  Registration, as it has been pointed  out before, is estimated to cost $1  to  $13 per transaction, while motor-voter  comes  to an estimated 3 cents to 35  cents per transaction.  As I said, Mr. Speaker, I wanted to  capture the words of some of those who  support this legislation. The National  Organization on Disability, for exam ple, whose national vice chairman is  Jim Brady, former White House press  secretary, says we should pass this leg islation because ""It would end years of  exclusion by providing an inexpensive  and efficient system for  inclusion  in  the franchise."" He is writing on behalf  of the disabled.  The Disabled American Veterans of  America also state thatAt issue is an easing of restrictions on the  voter registration process nationwide so that  all disabled Americans, including those dis abled in military service, would have easier  access  to  the most fundamental right our  country  affords her citizens-that  is,  the  right to be a part of our democratic process.  In closing, I would  like  to quote a  letter  from Antonia Hernandez  of  MALDEF, which  says,  and  I  think  many of us in this room share this sen timent:  The  adoption  of  this  legislation  w111  strengthen the voice of our citizens and help  rejuvenate our system of representative de mocracy.  The support of all of our Members  here 'is crucial to the success of this  legislation. Let us get these people on  the books. In many States, unless peo ple are registered, they do not receive  any educational material relating  to  the election or any information from  the candidates, so this will refresh our  process and reinvigorate our system. It  is time for us to get on with it.  ",1993
61,House,103,0.326,933,2,Mr. LIVINGSTON.," Mr. Chairman,  I  yield myself 30  seconds  to point out  that  the  Justice Department  says  same-day registration is conducive to  fraud and  that postcard registration,  according  to a New York grand  jury  convened  in 1982,  says  the advent of  mail-in registration leads to a most in credible opportunity for fraud.  My own registrar of voters in Jeffer son Parish in Louisiana says this bill  would be an open invitation to fraud,  so the views just expressed are not nec essarily shared by others around  the  country.

62,House,103,0.581,933,2,Mr. WALKER.," Mr. Chairman, when  the Michel amendment is offered later,  it will consist of  two parts; one  to  make sure  that citizens only can be  registered,  and  also  a  section  that  would say that has to be certified.  It  is my understanding  the Demo crats are now prepared to divide that  question  into  two parts. What  they  would do is say they will vote for the  idea that people have  to be citizens,  but then they are going to vote against  the  certification.  Understand what  that means. What they are prepared to  do is say that you have to be a citizen,  but wink-wink, no one will certify it,  so no one will know.  Well,  this  is  in  reality something  that should be called for what it is, le galized voter fraud. That is exactly the  problem with what we are doing here.  If you want  to know what  is sick  about the Congress,  look at what the  I yield  Democrats are prepared to do on the  upcoming Michel amendment. If you  want to know why people are sick and  tired of Congress,  look at what  the  Democrats are prepared to do on the  Michel amendment.  ",1993
63,House,103,-0.43,933,2,Mr. SWIFT.," Mr. Chairman,  myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman,  the Michel  amend ment's second portion is what is fraud ulent, because what it does is say noth ing in this bill will go into effect until  the State sends the certification to the  Attorney General, but it provides no  deadline which he ever has to do that.  Under the guise of a hot button polit ical issue,  this is simply an effort to  eviscerate  the central purpose of the  bill, pure and simple.  I would make one other point; that  is,  that the amendment which would  suggest that you must be a citizen is  redundant. In three separate places in side this bill already, it says that you  must be a citizen. That is in the legis lation. It is  in  the  legislation  three  times. They are  going  to  offer  an  amendment which will say  that you  have to do it a fourth time. It does not  make it any truer. It is redundant. It is  harmless. It is unnecessary. It is kind  of frivolous.  The fact is, obviously you must be a  citizen and the legislation states three  times you must be a citizen. The policy  will be you must be a citizen. We all  support that.  ",1993

66,House,103,-0.569,959,2,Mr. OWENS.," Madam Speaker,  last  week I reintroduced the resolution to  repeal the second amendment. The sec ond amendment is construed to be the  amendment which gives everybody the  right to own a gun. It is really not the  case, because the language talks about  the right to maintain a well-organized  militia.  A well-organized militia in this day  and age should be interpreted as a po lice department or a National Guard  unit. Those who wish to justify the pro liferation of guns in our society con tinue  to manufacture guns and  sell  them as if they were a piece of hard ware. Those persons insist on distort ing the Constitution and distorting the  second amendment, making it appear  that the second amendment gives every  American the right to own a gun, and  anybody who tries to control or regu late guns is automatically considered  unpatriotic, or in violation of the Con stitution. That is not the case.  The Supreme Court has ruled on sev eral occasions that government has the  right to regulate guns and the use of  guns in any way it wishes, that the sec ond amendment does not rule out a  State government. a city government.  or the National Government from regu lating guns. But as long as the second  amendment  is  there,  there are  those  who will insist that they have the right  and  the duty  to defend  the right  to  maintain guns for every individual who  wants to carry a gun and to minimize  the regulation of guns.  Even the very moderate piece of leg islation known as  the Brady bill,  a  very conservative, very modest piece of  legislation which proposes  to do  no  more than to require that anyone who  obtains a gun must wait 7 days, who  wants to buy a gun must wait 7 days  before  they can actually secure  the  gun,  that there must be a period, a  waiting period between the time they  make the first attempt to purchase a  ",1993

93,,103,-0.502,1037,2,Mr. MARKEY.," Mr.  Speaker, water  and  sewer rates  in  the Boston metropolitan area  are currently estimated to be the highest in the  country, and they will rise in coming years by  20 percent or more each year. The Massachu setts Water Resources Authority  reports  that  water and sewer bills will surpass property  taxes in some areas.  This rate shock could not come at a worse  time for the Bay State. Struggling to come out  of  the  recession,  residents, and businesses  will be hit with massive water and sewer rate  increases. As we position Massachusetts  to  lead the country into the next century in such  important  industries  as  telecommunications  and  information technology, we suddenly find  that the legacy of decades past is holding us  back.  The strength of the Massachusetts economy  depends on taking advantage of global oppor tunities in telecommunications, but it will also  depend on a favorable business environment.  With water and sewer rates projected  to  in crease 600 percent over 10 years, Massachu setts businesses will have great difficulty com peting in any industry.  The cost of the harbor cleanup  is huge- over $4 billion by  recent estimates. Without  assistance  from Federal and State govern ments, local ratepayers simply will not be able  to  foot  the bill. Next year water and sewer  rates in the Boston area will be twice the na tional average  for major metropolitan areas,  and it will only go up from there.  The  legislation we have  introduced would  provide $1  billion  in Federal  funding  for  the  cleanup of the harbor over the next 5 years.  Using MWRA estimates, the $1 billion in Fed eral funding authorized by the Boston Harbor  bill would mean a yearly reduction of $150 per  household and a  reduction of $4,500 per  household over  the 30 year  life of MWRA  bonds.

94,,103,-0.233,1037,2,Mr. GIBBONS.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing long-overdue legislation to strength en  the administration of our magnificent, yet  troubled National Wildlife Refuge System. The  refuge system is the only network of Federal  lands established primarily  to conserve wild life. With the steady loss of wildlife habitat in  this country from urbanization, agriculture, and  other land uses,  the  integrity of our National  Wildlife Refuge System has become more im portant than ever to  the conservation of the  Nation's wildlife.  This year marks the 90th anniversary of the  birth of the National Wildlife Refuge System.  In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt estab lished the very first refuge in my home State  of Florida at Pelican  Island. Today there are  over 480 refuges, including at least one refuge  in each of the 50 States. Many of these ref uges are of particular  importance  to endan gered species. For example,  in Florida we  . have refuges that were established to protect  some of the last remaining habitat for the en dangered Key Deer, West  Indian Manatee,  Snail Kite, Green Sea Turtles, Florida Panther,  and even a refuge established to conserve en dangered plants.  Unfortunately,  today our  refuge system  is  severely threatened by economic, recreational,  and even military activities. Two years ago,  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a re port that found at least one harmful activity oc curred on 63 percent of the Nation's refuges.  That discovery followed similar conclusions of  reports by the Department of the Interior, the  General Accounting Office, and the Fish and  Wildlife Service  in 1968, 1979, 1983, 1984,  and 1989.  It's time for Congress to give the refuge sys tem new directions, new tools, and new au thorities to restore integrity to the management  of these important lands.  The National Wildlife Refuge System Man agement and Policy Act of 1993 would amend  the National Wildlife Refuge System Adminis tration Act to address the many problems  in  the refuge system. The bill would, for the first  time, establish a clear set of purposes for the  refuge system,  require comprehensive plan",1993
95,House,103,0.382,1063,2,Mr. CANADY.," Mr. Speaker, President  Bill Clinton,  in his  address  to  the  American people last night, promised a  great deal of pain, but he did not really  clarify what pain might gain us. He  said his economic plan would create  500,000 new  jobs, but he did not say  where these jobs would be created. He  said he wanted to cut the deficit, but  he did not say by how much.  He said he wanted to invest more but  did not really clarify where the invest ment will be made.  He called for sacrifice. He called for  contributions. And he asked the middle  class to pay more in taxes.  So, what will this pain gain us? Well,  according to the stock market, which  has already fallen 72 points today after  the President's speech,  it will  not  produce more economic confidence, it  will not produce a more vibrant private  sector, it will not produce real private  sector expansion.  President Clinton's plan for pain will  gain us only more pain. That does not  seem like a reasonable sacrifice to me;  it is a sacrifice the American people  should not be forced to make.

96,House,103,-0.555,1063,2,Mr. HILLIARD.," Mr. Speaker, a grave  injustice to Tennessee's first and only  black Congressman has occurred.  In  the words of USA Today columnist  Dewayne Wickham, ""The scales of jus tice are way out of balance.""  Congressman FORD, who is facing re trial on fraud charges in his 6-year-old  indictment  is  facing  judgment by a  jury which is not only outside his home  and congressional district, but it consists of 17 whites and 1 African-Amer ican.  This extraordinary situation is based  upon the prosecution's argument that  because of  the Congressman's popu larity in his own congressional district,  the government cannot get a fair trial.  The prosecution has been given a  right which it does not deserve, to re move the trial from  the home of the  person charged to a jury not represent ative of his home.  If this trial, with a bused-in jury is  allowed  to occur, a dangerous prece dent will have been set. If this prece dent stands, what will stop this from  happening  to other Members of Con gress.  The conclusion that jurors cannot be  found among the more than 400,000 Af rican-Americans  in  the Memphis dis trict  is an  idea  that cannot be de fended. It is a serious violation of his  constitutional and civil rights.  Congressman FORD is not asking that  the wheels of justice be stopped, he is  only asking for relief from a  system  which has gone awry, a system which  has given him a stacked jury, rather  than a jury of his peers, which the Con stitution is supposed to guarantee him.  I ask my colleagues, both black and  white, Democrat and Republican, male  and female  to speak out against this  severe injustice.

97,House,103,-0.656,1063,2,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to call on Judge Jerome Turner  in Memphis, TN, to put an end to the  outrageous miscarriage of justice with  the  retrial  of Congressman HAROLD  FORD. This trial cannot proceed with a  jury that has been bused into Memphis  from Jackson, TN.  Mr. FORD  is African-American. The  Memphis area State  judicial district,  his district,  is approximately 40 per cent African-American. The  rest  of  west Tennessee, which includes Jack son,  is  less  than 20 percent African American. This bizarre busing in of ju rors from Jackson has resulted in the  selection of 12 jurors and 6 alternates,  only one of whom is African-American,  and 17 of whom are caucasian. This  outrageous manipulation of  the  jury  selection system has been caused by a  belief that Mr. FORD is too popular in  Memphis.  The Constitution  of  the  United States does not deny justice be cause of popularity. The Constitution  guarantees a defendant a  jury of his  peers. This basically all-white, hostile  jury  is not a  jury of Congressman  FORD'S peers, but rather in selecting  from  those bused  in,  the  judge even  commented on their bias.  Let us start all over again and select  a  representative  jury from  the Mem phis judicial district.

100,,103,0.213,1115,2,Mr. PRESSLER.," Mr. President, ear lier this summer, I had the privilege of  taking pa.rt in a South Dakota highway  dedication  ceremony,  naming South  Dakota Highway 37 as the Hubert H.  Humphrey Memorial Highway. Senator  Humphrey and his wife, Muriel, both  took a great interest in South Dako ta's transportation network.  In  fact,  Muriel continues  to be  interested  in  the  rural  transportation  needs  of  States like South Dakota. I would like  to discuss some of these unique needs  today.  Current air travel routes are of great  importance  to South Dakota. Yearly,  hundreds of  thousands of passengers  use  the  current air  routes  through  South Dakota. Both Sioux Falls and  Rapid City are vital  links for  inter state air travel. Due to the unfortunate  decline of the airline industry, South  Dakota has been a victim of routing  cuts,  leaving South Dakota commu nities like Aberdeen, Pierre, Yankton,  and Watertown cut off from other larg er communities. Air service is a vital,  time-efficient service for rural citizens.  The discontinuation of commuter serv ice, due to the questionable strategies  of the major airlines,  first and fore most, will adversely affect  the rural  traveler.  South Dakota has only one passenger  train service. It is the 1801 steam en gine which runs in the Black Hills. Its  purpose is for tourism. This train helps  visitors to enjoy the past and experi ence  intimately the scenic beauty of  the Black Hills.  On  the other hand, South Dakota's  commercial  railroads  provide  enor mous benefits to our agricultural and  mining  industries. Without  freight  service,  these  two key South Dakota  industries could not continue to com pete effectively.  Railways are part of the economic  lifeline of South Dakota agriculture  and mining. The vital interstate com merce linkages South Dakota rails pro vide could be lost unless greater atten tion is paid to proper maintenance and  improvement  efforts.  The  enhanced  transportation infrastructure programs  and  funding  promised  by President  Clinton should help in that regard.  Where air service  is not available  within the State, the automobile is the  next best option. South Dakota has  two  federally  funded  Interstate Sys tems--1-90 and I-29. They are simple,  efficient, and necessary. In addition to  the  interstates,  other  Federal  and  State highways provide  an  efficient  link between smaller communities. A  good highway system  is an essential  mode of transportation for both South  Dakotans  and  interstate  travelers.  This brings me back to Muriel Hum phrey Brown. She agrees with me that  a more balanced highway system  is  good for our region's travelers and our  region's economy.  At this point, Mr. President,  I ask  unanimous consent that a  letter from  Muriel Humphrey Brown be printed in  the RECORD.  There being no objection, the letter  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  OCTOBER 12, 1992.  DEAR SENATOR: Thanks so much for send ing your  remarks  to  the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD. It was so very good to see you again  and to have you participate in the highway  dedication.  The importance of good highways to the  South Dakota cities and towns needs to be  emphasized. I have a wish that both South  Dakota and Minnesota would join in getting  a good four-lane Interstate from  the Twin  Cities through Huron and beyond!

102,Senate,103,0.623,1180,2,Mr. SMITH.," Mr. President, I oppose  S. 1, the NIH reauthorization bill.  Last year, the majority leader, Sen ator MITCHELL, indicated that this bill  would be the first bill to be introduced  and one of the first items to be consid ered by the Senate during the 103d Con gress. At the time, I felt this commit ment was a little foolish. If President  Bush had won reelection, the bill would  have been vetoed again, and the veto  would have been sustained, given the  increase  in Republican  ranks  in  the  House. On the other hand, if Governor  Clinton was elected President-as he  was-the fetal tissue ban would be re scinded by Presidential directive and  the issue would be somewhat moot.  I do want to compliment the major ity leader in this regard, though. Un like  the  President,  he  does  carry  through with his promises, whether  wise or not.  I also want to compliment the Com mittee on Labor and Human Resources  for-wisely, in my opinion-avoiding a  potentially bloody battle which could  have occurred had it attempted to cod ify President Clinton's actions in lift ing of the fetal tissue ban. While  the  bill does not reinstate President Bush's  ban on  the use of fetal  tissue  from  aborted babies, as I would have pre ferred, neither does it explicitly codify  the Clinton policy. Therefore, it does  not prohibit some  future pro-life ad ministration  for  reimplementing  the  fetal  tissue ban. And it does contain  some anemic statutory restrictions on  fetal tissue research during the Clinton  administration. While  I believe  that  President Clinton's unfortunate rescis sion of the moratorium on fetal tissue  research  using  tissue  from  induced  abortions is regrettable, it is obvious  that it will not be  legislatively over turned under current circumstances.  Therefore, with respect to the fetal tis sue  issue, I have reached the conclu sion that, given that we have elected a  President who favors harvesting tissue  from aborted babies,  this language  is  probably the best we can do. For that  reason, I do not intend to engage in ex tended debate, as I did last year, be cause, frankly, extended debate would  be fruitless.  I still come down in opposition to the  bill,  because  it  is over budget  and  shortchanges my State of New Hamp shire. In a year in which the national  debt  is rapidly climbing  toward four  and a half  trillion dollars,  this bill  would increase NIH outlays to $5.88 bil lion in 1995 and $6.4 billion in 1996- nearly a half billion increase in 1 year.  Surely, this is not the form of sacrifice  and austerity it is going  to  take  to  cure our deficit problem. In fact, it is  just more  of  the  same business  as  usual.  I yield the floor.  If no one else desires to speak, I sug gest the absence of a quorum.  ",1993

104,Senate,103,-0.37,1180,2,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, I rise  with a great deal of enthusiasm and  pride to support the legislation pending  before the Senate, the reauthorization  of the National Institutes of Health.  Mr. President, this Senator has the  privilege of representing the National  Institutes  of Health. That  flagship  agency, designed to do  the basic bio medical  life science research for  the  The  United States of America, is located in  my own State of Maryland. Out there  we have 13,000 people working to find a  cure for cancer, working to find a cure  for AIDS, working to find a cure for  Alzheimer's. They are out there work ing, and we need to be able to work for  them  to give  them a modern frame work  for  the National  Institutes of  Health.  A year ago, I had a townhall meeting  with the people who work at the Na tional Institutes of Health to listen to  their very  good  ideas  on what we  should do  to prepare the National In stitutes of Health for the 21st century.  NIH is one of the crown jewels in our  Government. It is one of our flagship  institutions. I want to make sure the  capacity of this institution is not only  maintained, but made stronger.  That is why I am proud that parts of  this legislation are those elements that  I  introduced  that  hopefully  will  strengthen, first of all, the actual per sonnel and other activities  that will  enable  those Nobel Prize-winning re searchers to move ahead.  My components in this bill will ad dress many of the issues I heard about  from  the people at NIH  themselves,  those kinds of things we can do to re cruit and  retain personnel  from pa thologists  to  firefighters. Yes, NIH  must have its own firefighting unit be cause it runs a hospital and it has very  specialized research.  What we also do in this legislation is  streamline procedures to assure that a  dollar's worth of taxes means a pound  of cure.  I want to also thank my fellow Sen ators for working on something that  has been very special to me, and that is  on  the women's health agenda,  the  women's  health  agenda  that  was  brought  to  the attention of the U.S.  Senate and to the House of Representa tives in 1990. The Congresswomen and I  had asked  for a GAO  report asking  whether or not women were included in  the protocols of research at NIH, and  also what was the status of research  being done on those diseases that affect  women only, like cervical cancer.  We  found that women were system atically being excluded from  that re search. We found women were not in cluded in many of the research studies,  that the large study that said, Take an  aspirin a day to keep a heart attack  away, only included men.  This legislation that we are passing  today will make sure that never ever  happens again. We establish and make  permanent  the  Office  of Women's  Heal th at NIH  to make  sure  that  women are  included in the protocols  for  those diseases  that affect solely  women, primarily women, and to also  make sure  that  there  is research on  women's natural processes-pregnancy,  other matters  related  to  fertility,  menopause, even aging itself.  We have also matched our  finding  with our good intentions. We have in",1993
105,,103,0.591,1284,2,Mr. HEFLEY.," Mr. Speaker, as part of a con tinuing effort to reduce the size and complexity  of government, today I am reintroducing legis lation  to abolish  the Economic Development  Administration.  During  the most  recent campaign, Presi dent-elect Bill Clinton promised  to  increase  government  investment  in  America.  He  claimed that the United States was falling be hind our global competitors and that a new,  public-private partnership was needed  to  re store our economic dominance.  The  idea of a public-private partnership  is  nothing new. Ever since  the New Deal,  the  Federal Government has attempted  to use  public  funds  to stimulate private  investment  and growth. One such program  is  the Eco nomic Development Administration.  Selected by  the Carter administration  to  lead its urban renewal program, the EDA was  offered to the public as a vehicle for targeting  investment and  leveraging public moneys  to  attract private funds; a public-private partner ship to stimulate the economic development of  distressed areas.  Instead of symbolizing the new partnership  between public and private interests, the EDA  has come to represent Government waste and  inefficiency with a legacy of poor management  and poorer investments.  It is time to put this  failed experiment  in Federal  investment  to  rest. By terminating the EDA, we can stream line our Federal assistance programs and cut  $200 million from the budget each year.  HISTORY  The Economic Development Agency was  created in 1965 as part of the Great Society.  It was designed to administer programs pro viding assistance  to States, counties, cities,  and communities suffering  from substantial,  persistent,  or  potential  unemployment  and  underemployment.  In its inception, the EDA was established to  provide assistance  to  rural areas. Over  the  years,  the EDA's mission was broadened to  encompass urban areas and it began to make  direct and guaranteed  loans  to private busi nesses while continuing  to provide grants  to  State and local governments.  In many ways,  the Carter administration's  decision  to make a flagship out of the EDA  February 16, 1993  was the program's midas touch. Propelled out  of obscurity, the newly enlarged administration  began attracting headlines and the EDA's un derlying faults became readily apparent.  In 1981, citing a legacy of failed projects  and pork-riddled investments, the Reagan ad ministration targeted the EDA for elimination.  What  followed was a decade-long battle be tween Congress and  the Reagan and Bush  administrations  that ended when Bill Clinton  was elected to the White House.  During the decade, the budget for the EDA  dropped precipitously. From a high during the  Carter administration of over a billion dollars,  the EDA's budget fell to $257 million in fiscal  year 1992. This  lower profile, however, has  not shielded the administration from continued  criticism.  LEGISLATION  The bill I am introducing would terminate the  EDA taking effect in fiscal year 1994. The bill  would authorize the Secretary of Commerce to  continue to operate the EDA's revolving fund  until all its current obligations are concluded.  This  legislation  is not an attack upon  the  people who work at the EDA. The EDA's fail ure can be attributed to an unworkable man date  and  congressional micromanagement,  not civil servants.  It does not eliminate Federal assistance to  State and local governments. The Community  Development Block Grant Program currently  serves many of the same constituents served  by the EDA. The CDBG program does it bet ter, with  fewer controversies and embarrass ments.  This bill is an attack on Government waste.  The EDA has  invested  in empty  industrial  parks,  roads  that  lead nowhere, and sewer  hookups to empty fields. At one point, over 40  percent of the businesses invested in by the  EDA were in default.  It's also an attack on pork-barrel spending.  When the EDA was created, 12 percent of the  population qualified for EDA grants. Today, 90  percent of the country  lives  in areas eligible  for EDA assistance.  Obviously, 90 percent of this country is not  economically  distressed.  Instead,  eagerly  seeking out Federal dollars, Congress has ex panded  the EDA's  jurisdiction  to  the point  where its original mandate to assist areas with  high unemployment has become meaningless.  Furthermore, there is a long list of examples  where  individual Congressmen have  forced  the EDA to fund projects that were  ineligible  for EDA assistance. To many,  the EDA be came a pork-barrel slush  fund  for powerful  Members of Congress and their friends.  CONCLUSION  The history of the EDA is a history of failure  and frustration. Simply put,  it is not the Fed eral Government's job to make  local  invest ments. There are  too many pitfalls, political  and otherwise, to do the job well.  For a President  focused on public-private  partnerships,  the EDA provides Bill Clinton  with an excellent example of what not to do.  Envisioned as an administration  to  facilitate  economic growth in distressed areas, the EDA  became a means for individual Congressmen  to fund their pet projects or to provide favors  to political allies.

109,Senate,103,0.466,1310,2,Mr. MACK.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today to bring to the attention of my  colleagues an outstanding  individual  who devoted his  life's work  to agri culture, both nationally and in Florida.  Mr. George F. Sorn retired as executive  vice president of the Florida Fruit &  Vegetable Association on December 31,  1992, after 40 years of dedicated service  to the industry.  His involvement with all aspects of  Florida  agriculture was  the  spring board that brought him national rec ognition as a  leader and spokesperson  for all o! agriculture. During his career  he has served on many Federal and  State  commissions  and  councils.  In  1987, President Reagan appointed him  to serve on the Commission on Agricul tural Workers.  George graduated from Rutgers Uni versity with a BS degree in agriculture  in 1950. He took time out of his college  studies  to serve 18 months with  the  U.S. Air Force in the late 1940's. Prior  to his joining the Florida Fruit & Veg etable Association in 1953 as a field rep resentative, he spent 2 years working  with Seabrook Farms in Bridgeton, NJ,  serving in various labor related super visory capacities.  George  was  named  manager  of  FFVA's Labor Division  in 1967. This  was the beginning of George's climb to  the top at FFV A. On March 1, 1981, he  was named assistant general manager,  in addition to his continuing duties as  manager of the labor division. In April  of 1984, he was named secretary-treas urer, executive vice president and gen eral manager.  In addition  to his membership  in  many agricultural associations on both  the State and Federal  level, George  found time to devote to humanitarian  and human rights issues in the agricul tural industry. He has received many  awards and honors throughout his ca reer in recognition of these efforts.  The most recent award was presented  at FFV A's 49th annual convention. He  was presented FFV A's prestigious Dis tinguished Service Award. His major  awards include ""Life Member Award""  for Optimist International (1971); ""Cer tificate  of Appreciation""-State  of  Florida Department of Labor and Em ployment Security  (1983);  ""Award of  Recognition"" by  the Employer's Na tional Job Service Committee  (1984);  ""Award of Appreciation"" by the Red lands Christian Migrant Association  (1985);  ""Award of Merit  for Distin guished Service to Agriculture"" by the  Gamma Signa Honorary Society of Ag riculture (1986); ""Certificate of Appre ciation"" by Florida Governor's Advi sory Council on Farmworker Affairs  (1986):  ""State  Friend  of Extension  Award"" by the Alpha Delta Chapter of  Epsilon Sigma Phi-Honorary Agricul tural  Extension  Service  Fraternity  (1987);  ""Chairman's Roundtable""-Dis tinguished Honor Roll of United Fresh  Fruit and Vegetable Association (1990);  ""Award  of Merit  for Distinguished  Service  to the Food and Agricultural  Industry of Florida"" by the University  of Florida's Institute of Food and Agri cultural Sciences (1992); and most re cently he was awarded the ""Bert Roper  Humanitarian of the Year Award"" by  the Orange County Public School Mi grant Program.  George was responsible for develop ing agricultural labor seminars over 20  years ago that continue to address the  major  concerns  facing  the  industry  today.  Since becoming general manager in  1984, George Sorn added two new divi sions at Florida Fruit and Vegetable  Association to respond to the changing  demands of the industry. The first divi sion was environmental and pest man agement, which marked a first for any  organization in the fruit and vegetable  industry  to establish a unit  to deal  with these important issues on a full scale basis. A communications and edu cation division was created 3 years ago  to meet the ever increasing needs,  to  be more  responsive  to  the media.  George felt it was imperative that the  organization spend full time telling the  public, media and legislators about the  importance of Florida agriculture and  all the good things they do in providing  safe, healthy -food  to  the American  consumer.  Mr. President, I know my colleagues  here in the Senate join me in recogniz ing the many years of dedicated, self less service George Sorn has provide-d  to the agricultural community and the  American public. His work has had a  significant impact on the agricultural  community, and I am proud to com mend George for his years of service.  ""THE TIMES ARE A CHANGIN""  ",1993

I ask unanimous consent that ""The  Times Are a Changin"" be printed at  this point in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  ""THE TIMES ARE A CHANGIN""  At  the birth of our country my ""many  greats"" grandfather, William Paca,  along  with others,  signed his name below John  Hancock on the Declaration of Independence.  In  those  days men  pledged  their  sacred  honor. It had genuine meaning and guaran teed the public they served-honesty and in tegrity.  Today, more  than 200 years later politi cians and lawyers are evolving a new and dis gusting philosophy relative to the character  of those whom we elect to manage the affairs  of our country. We have traveled down the  road from sacred honor to today's ""Don't not  do it, just don't get caught."", a sad milepost  in the total collapse of what is honorable,  right and fair. The newest position taken by  our president is ""Go ahead and do  it. It's  OK."", ""If you get caught I will pardon you!""  What kind of a message is that to send to our  youth of all ages? How can we expect coming  generations to hold high the Torch of Honor  for the world to see, when such a revolting  example is provided for them by the highest  level of our government.

113,Senate,103,0.287,1349,2,Mr. COCHRAN.," Mr. President, I am  pleased to see that the bill before us  today includes a provision to establish  a program within the National Center  for Research Resources to enhance the  ability of institutions in certain States  to compete for biomedical and other  research grants and awards offered by  the NIH.  The program in the bill is called the  Institutional  Development  Award  [IDeA] Program. It is similar in nature  to the Experimental Program to Stim ulate Competitive Research [EPSCoR]  that originated in the National Science  Foundation and has now spread to sev eral Federal agencies. These programs  provide grants to States that have tra ditionally not been very successful in  competing  for  federally  funded  re search projects. The initial grants help  these States  determine where  they  need to improve their research infra structure  at  their  research  univer sities, and f ollowup grants help these  States to implement their plans to cor rect the deficiencies they discover.  This program does not set aside any  funds  for  research  for  these  institu tions, which  are  located mostly  in  rural States such as my State of Mis s1ss1ppi.  The  universities  in  these  States will  still be  required  to  go  through the peer review process before  any research grants are awarded. The  IDeA and EPSCoR Programs simply  boost  the  ability of universities  to  compete in that process.  As an example of the kinds of accom plishments  that are possible  through  programs like  this,  the EPSCoR Pro gram in Mississippi has produced un precedented cooperation among our re search institutions, and has resulted in  an .increase in grants being awarded to  the State by the agencies involved in  the program. In addition to increased  Federal funding, our research univer sities have received a  level of private  research contributions  that exceeded  all expectations and far exceeded the  matching requirements of the EPSCoR  Program.  I am confident  the  IDeA Program  will produce the same quality results  as the EPSCoR Program has. The IDeA  Program will broaden  the geographic  base of biomedical scientific expertise.  Currently, 50 percent of all NIH extra mural funding goes to institutions in  five States. Funding currently going to  the 25 States that will be eligible for  IDeA totals only 5 percent of NIH's re search awards. With improvements re sulting  from  IDeA awards, more  re search will be conducted at more uni versities, which has the added benefit  of exposing more students to this type  of  research,  therefore  encouraging  more science graduates to pursue a ca reer in health-related research.  The NIH itself has seen the value of  a program of this kind. In 1991, NIH  completed a study I had requested to  determine whether  this  type of pro gram would  be  feasible within  the  structure of NIH. The report concluded  that an  IDeA Program  can  indeed  achieve  the  same  accomplishments  that have been seen at other agencies.  In this year's appropriations bill for  the NIH, $750,000 was provided to the  National  Center  for  Research  Re sources to help get this program off the  ground. Last month, the NCRR began  to solicit applications for  the  initial  IDeA competition. I am hopeful addi-: tional funding will be available next  fiscal year.  I appreciate the efforts of the chair man of the Labor Committee, Senator  KENNEDY,  for his help in getting the  IDeA Program authorized in this bill.

REMARKS OF LEON WIESELTIER   ",1993
115,Senate,103,-0.303,1375,2,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr.  President,  I  would like to bring to my colleagues'  attention an article, ""Presidential Pol itics  in South Dakota, 1936.""  It was  written by Philip A. Grant, Jr., a dis tinguished professor of history at Pace  University in New York.  One of the major themes of the arti cle  is the  tendency of South Dakota  voters  to split their tickets .. In 1936,  South Dakotans voted  for President  Roosevelt  and  elected  a Republican  Governor and Congressman. Last No vember, SouthDakotans favored Presi dent Bush and reelected a Democratic  Senator and Congressman.  I ask that Professor Grant's fascinat ing article be printed in the RECORD  and commend it to my colleagues.  The article follows:  ",1993
116,House,103,0.443,1388,2,Mr. HASTERT.," Mr. Speaker,  in his  speech  on Monday  night, President  Clinton  invoked  patriotism  as  the  badge of honor for those who support  his program. Those who question it or  disagree are special  interests and, at  least in the President's mind, not pa triots.  I question  the President's at tempt to cloak his tax-and-spend pro gram with the American flag.  This country has many kinds of pa triots. Some risked their lives to fight  for  their country in time of war and  they are now facing the prospect of in creased taxes on their Social Security.  They are no less patriots if they ques tion the need  to increase  their  taxes  while providing Ii ttle  in  the way of  meaningful deficit reduction.  Many  now  feel misled because of  President Clinton's about face on giv ing  the middle class a  tax cut. Are  those people unpatriotic if they express  their anger at being deceived?  Are  they  unpatriotic  if  they  ask  about cutting spending instead? If I re member history  correctly,  the  first  American patriots began by asking real  questions about taxes.  PRESIDENT CLINTON'S ECONOMIC  PACKAGE  (Mr. RAHALL asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1993
117,House,103,-0.306,1388,2,Mr. RAHALL.," Mr. Speaker,  tonight  President Clinton unveils his economic  plan to the Nation.  He will  speak of  fairness. He will  speak of creating 500,000 real jobs, in vesting in America,  investing in edu cation,  providing  vaccinations  and  fully funding Head Start for our chil dren, reducing the deficit, and health  care for all Americans.  President Clinton will  real  figures,  no  smoke,  speak  from  screens and  mirrors anymore, but honesty in budg eting.  For 12 years we have been told we  must spend billions on bombers-that  there are no millions for our bridges.  Tomorrow, Mr. Speaker,  the Con gress can say to the President, let the  dirt fly. Let us rebuild America.  Let us rebuild our water systems, our  highways and our bridges of steel.  Let us rebuild our bridges of heart,  rather than a heartless recovery, and  hope  for our children's future. Some  say do nothing, that ""In the long run  we will grow out of this mess.""  Well, Mr. Speaker, as a great man  once said, ""People don't eat in the long  run, they eat every day.""  sector, w)lere the needs and concerns of  the private sector take their well-de served place in the overall picture of  our economic well-being.  Mr. Speaker, tonight from our Presi dent we will hear a message of a com mitment to change, fairness, economic  recovery, and honesty, honesty in his  figures. As you have heard my col leagues say, no smoke and mirrors this  time.  What that means to the people of my  district, the Sixth District of Missouri,  is a promise of action from those of us  here in Washington. What that means  to us is a rededication to change, with  a spirit of cooperation and fairness.  MIDDLE CLASS TAX HIKE NOT  PATRIOTIC, BUT IDIOTIC  (Mr. BOEHNER asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks, and to include extraneous ma terial.)  ",1993
118,House,103,0.513,1388,2,Mr. BOEHNER.," Mr. Speaker, Mon day, the President offered his reasons  for abandoning  the middle class and  used a lot of fancy charts and figures  to make his case.  Well, he left one chart out, this one.  Over the last 12 years, Government rev enues have increased dramatically.  The problem in not that we do not  tax  enough,  it  is  that Government  spends too much.  The President has reverted  to  true  form, that of a tax and spend, old-time  Democrat. He has abandoned  tens of  millions  of middle-class voters  that  trusted him.  Raising taxes on the middle class is  not patriotic, it is idiotic.  Five  times in the past 12 years we  have told middle-class Americans that  we must raise  their taxes  to balance  the budget. Five  times, we have  told  middle class America  that we would  control spending. Five times, we have  betrayed the middle class. Let us not  try tax and spend again.

119,House,103,-0.186,1388,2,Ms. DANNER.," Mr. Speaker,  tonight  President Clinton will  address  the  American people. At that time he will  produce a plan to foster a faster grow ing economy, a more productive econ omy, one that will produce more jobs,  produce more jobs in order to address  the unemployment and underemploy ment faced by far too many American  citizens today.  Tonight, we will hear from President  Clinton. He will talk to us about devel oping a much-needed cooperative link  between government and  the private  REAL CANDOR WOULD HELP IN  THE FISCAL DEPARTMENT  (Mr. HYDE asked and was given per mission  to address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1993
120,House,103,0.312,1388,2,Mr. HYDE.," Mr. Speaker, among the  great mysteries of the current time is  whatever happened to the middle-class  tax cut? It is now a middle-class tax in crease.  I recall recently the President saying  that the reason for this reversal is the  upward revision in the deficit figures  that  the Bush administration  finally  provided. The deficit is higher than he  had  imagined  or  dreamed,  he  said,  therefore,  the notion of a  balanced  budget, much  less a middle-class  tax  cut had gone aglimmering.  In my  ongoing  research,  I  came  across Business Week of July 6, 1992,  reporting on a June 23 interview with  the then-candidate for the Presidency,  Mr. Clinton. He was asked:  Why are you revising your economic strat egy now and backing away from the goal of  a balanced budget by 1996?  This is last June, Mr. Speaker. Mr.  Clinton's answer was:  A When  I began  the campaign,  the pro jected deficit was $250 billion. Now, it's up to  $400 billion. I've watched the economy pick  up very slowly, if at all. I hadn't cut govern ment as much as I wanted to, and I need to  put teeth into that idea.  So the President well knew that the  deficit was $400 billion  last June. It  just seems to me a little candor on the  part of Mr. Clinton would help us as we  debate the tax and spend proposals we  will hear about tonight.  THE UNFAIR PROSECUTION OF  CONGRESSMAN HAROLD FORD  (Mr. BLACKWELL  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1993
121,House,103,-0.538,1388,2,Mr. BLACKWELL.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise to protest what seems clearly to be  a case of unfair prosecution.  Of course, I speak of the retrial of the  first and only African-American Con gressman from the State of Tennessee,  our colleague, HAROLD FORD.  ",1993
122,House,103,-0.191,1401,2,Mr. FINGERHUT.," Mr. Speaker,  to night President Clinton will come  to  this Chamber to begin a national de bate on the economy and on the budg et. He has already taken measures in  the White House to reduce his staff, to  begin to reduce the budget of the Fed eral Government, and to begin to ap proach the American people with com plete openness and honesty about the  future of this country.  In his address on television the other  night to the American people, he ex pressed his concern that the plan will  not receive a  fair hearing because of  the  influence of special  interests on  this body. Mr. Speaker, Mr. President,  I share that concern, and I know a lot  of Members of  this body share  that  concern as well. That is why I rise this  afternoon  to ask that this body, and  the  leadership of  this body, and  the  chairmen of our committees, move as  quickly as we can to take up the sub ject of campaign finance reform.  Mr. Speaker, nothing, nothing would  tell the American people more directly  that the decisions that we are going to  make over the next few months, that  the plans that we are going to approve,  and the programs that we are going to  adopt have been done with only their  best interests in mind, than if we were  to quickly,  forcefully,  and dramati cally adopt a campaign finance reform  bill.  Mr. Speaker, that bill must have as  part of its measures at least two provi sions: It must place a  limit on  the  amount of money that can be spent in  congressional campaigns.  Mr. Speaker, we all know  that the  spending has gotten out of hand. We  understand that when millions of dol lars are spent on campaigns  to elect  Members to this body, that the money  must come from somewhere, and where  that money comes from calls into ques tion  the ultimate  integrity  of  this  body.  Mr.  Speaker,  second, we must do  something  to  reduce  the amount of  money we  spend on campaigns. The  fact of the matter is that in this day  and age, the way we communicate with  our constituents is through television  and the radio.  Mr. Speaker, you know  that  those  media are public  licenses granted  to  private corporations, and I believe it is  time that as a condition of the public  license, we ask those private entities  who are profiting from the public air waves to help us solve the problem of  campaign finance reform by permitting  us  to have  time  to address our con stituents directly.  If we do  that, Mr. Speaker, and the  American people, we will not need as  much money to run our campaigns and  we will not need to put ourselves into  the process of campaign  fundraising  that we have done before. We will begin  to send a message to the American peo ple  that we are going  to be making  these decisions in an open and honest  way.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Arizona [Mr. COPPERSMITH].  ",1993
123,House,103,-0.238,1401,2,Mr. COPPERSMITH.," I thank the gen tleman from Ohio for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to join my col league from Ohio, Mr. FINGERHUT,  in  favor of campaign  finance  reform.  I  wish to add as a personal note, maybe  engage  in  a  colloquy  with  Mr.  FINGERHUT:  I  think, from my personal  experience, I ran against an incumbent,  his prescription, Mr. FINGERHUT's pre scription,  is  entirely  right.  I  ran  against an incumbent who spent more  ",1993
124,House,103,-0.479,1414,2,Mr. TUCKER.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  so much the gentleman from New York  [Mr. OWENS] and the gentleman from  HARDT],  Missouri [Mr. GEPHARDT], our majority  leader.  Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more  with the majority leader on this point.  As I echoed in the House earlier today,  it is so imperative that we do step back  and we  look at  the President's eco nomic plan in total, holistically, and  not just pick apart and become very  petty about what this means and por tends for our country.  We have seen in  the last couple of  weeks discussion on whether or not  there is importance in having an eco nomic  stimulus  package,  otherwise  known, as our Republican colleagues  say, as spending. But there  is a dif ference between spending and invest ing. Just cutting spending will not get  the job done in terms of the spiraling  deficit that we now face in this coun try. What we need is vision. We have  heard the saying that ""Where there is  no vision, the people perish,"" and that  it truly what is going to happen to this  country unless we embrace the vision  today for the future of America tomor row.  We must come  together right now  and we must recommit if we are truly  concerned about family values. If we  are  truly concerned about American  values, we must tonight make an effort  to  recommit, whether Republican or  Democrat, black or white, urban or  rural, and we must take a stand to sup port the President when he talks about  investing  in our  economy, when he  talks  about  growing  our  economy,  growing public infrastructure, growing  human infrastructure.  These are the things that Americans  have been waiting for. What they have  not been waiting for is more gridlock.  What they have not been waiting for is  more  rhetoric. What  they have not  been waiting  for  is more  talk about  who  is  doing what  and  not  really  doing it.  0 1750  It is  interesting, Mr. Speaker, and  Mr. Majority Leader,  that  the same  persons who have been on the side of  the  read-my-lips  tax culpability can  now come before this House and talk  about taxation. Yes,  there is taxation  in the President's plan, but that is only  one part of his plan, and it is not going  to serve this country well  if we have  the nay-sayers  to come very quickly  and  to pick that part out and put it  under the microscope.  In effect, Mr. Speaker,  this  is  the  time to find out the true mettle of all  of us as Americans, not just Democrat  Americans or Republican Americans,  but as Americans  to put  aside  the  partisanism, to put aside the pettyism,  and to be fair, to be open-minded, open hearted, and to really give the Presi dent an opportunity  to  present his  package.  There will be some criticisms, there  will be some tough choices. We will all  have to make them. But for the first  time in a  long time let us do what is  right in this country. Let us not talk  about taxation for taxation's sake, but  let us talk about what has to happen to  make this country move in the direc tion that it must move in.  For example, I have heard all day on  the floor bandied around the fact that  the middle class is going to have to pay  for  this new economic package,  this  new economic stimulus. Let us once  again look at the facts and the accu racy of that.  I am  informed by  the  White House that 70 percent of all of  the revenues that have to be raised will  be incurred by the rich.  Once again, let us look at the facts,  and  let us not  just put rhetoric out  there to stir up and to place fear in the  minds of the American people. We can  play games with the American people if  we want to, but in the long run, and in  the final analysis who will suffer from  this? Not Democrats who are trying to  work with  the President, but Ameri cans, whether  they be Democrats or  Republicans, who are out there looking  for leadership from all of us. They will  be looking tonight. They will be look ing tonight at this greater than they  do  the Grammy Awards, greater than  they do  the American Music Awards,  greater than they do  the Super Bowl.  This  is  the Super Bowl of all Super  Bowls. People are waiting to see not  only what the President has to say, but  they are going to be waiting, and they  are going to be listening to see what we  have to say after the President speaks,  for in effect, Mr. Speaker, the deafen ing silence or the cacophony of criti cism after the President speaks will be  what people will be looking for and lis tening for. They will be listening to see  the  tirade of those who are quick to  just criticize on the sidelines, or they  will be  listening to see  if those who  want to come into the harmony of sup port and to help put this country back  on track, and to create the economic  engine and vehicle that will respond to  the despair and pain that many Ameri cans are feeling out there.  Yes,  there is taxation, but these  is  also investment. Yes, there are spend ing cuts, but there is also investment.  Yes, the President is coming tonight  with a comprehensive economic pack age, and we owe it to him, but even  more  importantly we owe  it  to  this  country and to  the citizens to listen  with fair ears and a watchful heart to  make sure that his plan has an oppor tunity to be burst into reality.

That is all the more reason I  take special pride in talking today about Troop  9, American Legion Post 553 of South Glens  Falls, NY.  2945  Troop 9 will celebrate  its 50th anniversary  on February 25. I has been an impressive 50  years. Over 50 young men have become Ea gles, and anyone who has a background  in  Scouting knows what that entails. The  troop  has produced outstanding professionals in the  fields of teaching, law enforcement, engineer ing, medicine, the military, and many others.  Troops 9 has been involved in such projects  as food collections, a cancer bike-a-thon, visits  to nursing homes, painting  the  inside of a  church, and a variety of flag day activities.  Troop 9 received a special award for work ing on the Historical Trail. Troop 9 Scouts also  took a 50-mile-hike. Twenty years ago, Troop  9 traveled to the National Jamboree in Idaho.  The history of Troop 9 actually began in the  1930's, when  it was organized by the South  Glens Falls Methodist Church. However,  the  troop's charter was dropped once World War  II began. By 1943, however, the charter was  picked up by the American Legion.  Troop 9's Scoutmasters have included such  gentlemen  as  Frank  Holden,  Seward  Washburn, Ed White, Burdell Bailey, Lloyd  Johnson, Harry Van Seay, Tom Osier, Phil  Comeau, and the present Scoutmaster, Chris  Jones.  Mr. Speaker Scouting has been an appren ticeship  in  life and citizenship  for countless  young Americans. The various  troops across  the country have been a rich source of our  leaders for generations.  Please  join me  in wishing a happy 50th  birthday to one of the  finest of those troops,  Troop 9, American Legion Post 553 of South  Glens Falls, NY.  OF  RECOGNITION  HAROLD  R.

Harold Gary retired on January 3, 1993 with  almost 32 years of Federal service. He began  his career with the Soil Conservation Service  on February 1 , 1965 as a soil conservationist  in the Yazoo City, MS field office after 3 years  with  the Cooperative Extension Service. He  progressed up the career ladder with assign ments to Vicksburg, and as District Conserva tionist at Forest and Hernando. On November  9, 1975, he became Area Conservationist at  Brookhaven, my hometown.  During his career, Harold was  recognized  several  times  through  the  incentive awards  program for his outstanding accomplishments.

128,,103,-0.547,1440,2,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Speaker,  I'd like to take  this opportunity to invite my colleagues to join  me in sponsoring a resolution to help end the  Azerbaijani blockade of Armenia. As a result  of the blockade, Armenia is facing a winter of  subzero temperatures without electricity, heat ing fuel, public transportation, telephone serv ices,  functioning  factories, newspapers, and  fresh water. The recent destruction of the last  fuel pipeline into Armenia has left tens of thou sands of its people in danger of death by ex posure and starvation.  The resolution  I am introducing today con demns the Azerbaijani blockade and calls for  continued efforts to send humanitarian assist ance to Armenia. The resolution also calls for  aid  to be withheld  to Azerbaijan until  the  blockade is lifted, pursuant to the Freedom of  Support Act passed last year.  For the past 5 years, the blockade has hin dered Armenia's efforts  to  recover  from  the  devastating 1988 earthquake. The blockade  also threatens to derail Armenia's successful  transition to a democratic and free market sys tem. Now the blockade threatens to take tens  of  thousands of  lives. The world community  cannot tolerate the use of economic strangula tion against civilian populations as a means of  achieving political goals.  In closing, I once again urge my colleagues  to  join me  in cosponsoring  this resolution  to  help bring an end  to  the  terrible suffering  in  Armenia and Karabagh.

Ceres was founded by Daniel Whitmore  in  1867 and became a  township  in  January  1910. It is a city which has truly been enriched  by  its history and diversity. The name Ceres  refers  to  the Roman goddess who presided  over  festivals of  fertility and harvest. Ceres  stands for the health, beauty, fruitfulness, and  wholesomeness of our community.  Ceres began as one of California's fine agri cultural communities.  It supplied both Califor nia's residents as well as the Nation's harvest  needs in a number of areas. As a small com munity  in the Central Valley, Ceres is recog nized for its contributions toward agriculture.  The community of Ceres stands behind its  people. The population has grown from a few  hundred  to 30,000, but  it has always wel comed newcomers with open arms. During  this time, Ceres has always sought to protect  its heritage. Currently,  the  restoration of the  123-year-old Daniel Whitmore home is under way under the leadership of Leona Garrison,  Caryl Fowler, and Ruth Jorgenson with  the  help of the Soroptimist International of Ceres.  The city of Ceres is a close-knit, family-ori ented community.  It has always encouraged  its youth to set goals for themselves and strive  to  reach  those goals. Many of  its  residents  have served our country proudly in a number  of different capacities.  ""Together We Achieve""  is  the slogan  that  Ceres prides  itself on. This statement could  not be more representative of Ceres.  I am proud to speak before you on the 75th  anniversary of the city of Ceres. I am equally  proud  to  represent  it and  its citizens. As a  former city councilman and mayor, I am con fident Ceres will be as prosperous during the  next 75 years and will continue  to positively  contribute to our State and Nation.

So I think it is good that we have an  open rule, but I am disappointed that  we are discussing this issue again, be cause you feel like you can maybe get  a majority but you cannot get the two thirds under suspension.

During the hearing, they gave a long  litany of how  they are going  to cut  back on some of these services. Closing  schools early is one of the possibilities.  Why are these jobs that I have talked  about  important? People go  to work;  they pay  taxes. People are no  longer  relying on welfare and unemployment.  People  regain  their  self-respect  by  being able to provide for their families.  What did my friends on the other side  really do by defeating  the  stimulus  package? I repeat, perhaps they embar rassed President Bill Clinton, but most  of all, as time will tell, they have em barrassed themselves and the American  public because what has happened  is  not good for this country.  Very soon, this body will be debating  the President's budget plan,  a  plan  that some,  if not most, on the other  side of the aisle will say  is nothing  more than tax and spend. Well, we, the  Democrats, were  not  in  the White  House the last 12 years when the debt  went from $1 to $4 trillion. I think it is  important to recognize that we have to  start working together to not become  masters of gridlock but masters of  moving this country along so that peo ple like Norma can have a job not only  this summer but  in  the summers  to  come.  The Washington  Post  yesterday  brought to light something I have been  telling my  constituents  for  a  long  time. I quote:  Nothing did more to end the Great Depres sion and the enormous amount of money the  Federal Government spent in the war years.  Taxes went up, spending soared,  the econ omy boomed. A good Republican, Dwight D.  Eisenhower, did a lot to prime the economy  by launching the Interstate Highway System  in the 1950's.  We all know, Mr. President, that we  need to cut spending, but we have to  cut spending where  it will do  some  good. We  have  to  increase  spending  where that will do some good. I think  that we had better stop trying to em barrass Bill Clinton, as some  in  this  body do, and try to do things that will  uplift this country so that young ladies  like  the girl  in Reno sitting on  the  sidewalk looking at want ads will not  look at us and say, ""Why did they do  this to me?""  So I think we should start being posi tive and not negative, and in the hope  of this I extend my hand of cooperation  and  friendship  to my  friends on  the  other side of the aisle, hoping that we  can move this country down the road  to improvement.

143,Senate,103,0.46,170,8,Mr. KEMPTHORNE.," Mr. President,  among the tall pines in the mountains  of northern Idaho, at the confluence of  the St. Joe and St. Maries Rivers, lies  a small community called St. Maries,  ID. Those two rivers drain the wild and  primitive Bitterroot Range as they roll  toward beautiful lake Coeur D'Alene.  The  town of St. Maries  is a  quiet,  peaceful community of 2,500 people.  But the tranquillity of this tiny town  is being threatened; threatened-with out reason-by the U.S. Government.  This Government-our Government- says that St. Maries violates the Fed eral surface water treatment rule, even  though  the city's water  supply has  come  from  the  same  crystal  clear  source since the 1930's without any ad verse impact to the health of residents  for generations. St. Maries violation is  solely  the result of changing govern mental water quality  standards and  not because of any health threat to any  of the citizens.  This city has already  spent more  than $870,000  on past compliance on  Federal guidelines. They are still serv icing that debt. Remember,  this is a  town of 2,500 people.  The city estimates that it will cost $3  to $5 million to fully comply with the  new  standards of  the  surface water  treatment rule. But, because of their  experience dealing with past Federal  mandates,  the  city  leaders  of  St.  Maries are understandably hesitant to  spend $3 million or more until the tar get of Federal mandates stops moving.  Imagine  placing  a  debt  of between  $2,500 and $4,000 on the backs of water  users in this city of crystal clear wa ters, all this for a multimillion-dollar  treatment plant  that  in a  few years  may become obsolete or insufficient for  its planned purpose due to constantly  changing Federal standards.  The city of St. Maries wants to take  whatever steps are necessary to ensure  the continued good health of their citi zens. However,  in  the words of their  city engineer, ""It is difficult to speak  to the risk of waterborne diseases to a  community that has consumed water  from a specific source their entire lives  with no measurable adverse impact to  their health or livelihood.""  That is from the city engineer.  But,  I  say  to my  colleagues, St.  Maries is not alone.  Thousands of cities, large and small,  are  struggling with how  to  comply  with mandates  imposed by Congress  and the Federal Government. The prob lem has become so serious that Arizona  Governor, Fife Symington, says  that  ""mandates from  the Federal Govern ment have stripped us of our fiscal sov ereignty and have stripped the people  of their right to representative govern ment at the state level.""  Listen  to what others are  saying  about this problem of unfunded Federal  mandates.  Chicago's Mayor Rich Daley  is  so  angry with unfunded Federal mandates  that he is challenging Washington bu reaucrats  to ""put your money where  your mouth is."" In 1992 Chicago was  socked with a $160 million bill for pro grams  the Federal Government man dated but refused to fund. That was re ported as more than three times great er than the proposed property tax in crease for the current year in the city  of Chicago. Mayor Daley called un funded  mandates  ""hidden  Federal  taxes, bleeding our  limited resources  and cutting in to direct services.""  Richard ""Moose"" Conner, mayor of  Streator,  IL,  population  15,000,  says  that roughly 40 percent of the Streator  budget goes  toward  funding Federal  mandates.  The National Conference  of State  Legislatures has estimated that man dates  passed  in  the  lOlst Congress  would cost State governments $15 bil lion over the next 5 years. Most States  and localities are required to have bal anced budgets, and the cost of compli ance with new mandates means  they  must find more revenue. In too many  cases, the source of this new revenue is  in the form of new taxes.  The Arizona Republic reports that re cent studies indicate that as much as  60 percent of some State budgets  is  spent on joint Federal-State programs.  In any given day all across this coun try of ours, you can pick up your daily  paper and read headlines of what other  officials are  saying, what  the news papers are printing. These are  just a  few excerpts from some of the news papers that are talking about this fis cally vert important issue:  ""Mayor Daley urges U.S. to cut cost ly  mandates""-Chicago  Sun-Times  11120/92.  ""Let Congress Be A Partner, Not A  Dictator""-The  Washington  Post  8/12192.  ""Stop Sending the Feds To Do  the  States' Jobs""-The Washington Post  6/14192.  ""Washington's  Whims  Become  States' Burden""-The Detroit News  2/21/93.  And from the Evening News in Har risburg, PA, ""Report Hits Federal-level  Mandates, Finds Them Drain on Cash,  Priorities.''  This intrusion into the rights of local  governments must stop. The citizens of  communities all across America elect  local officials  to direct  the future of  their cities and towns based on the pri orities established by those closest to  the problems and challenges. To have  Federal bureaucrats thousands of miles  away in Washington, DC, mandate ex pensive programs that deprive cities of  additional police officers or firemen is  simply not right.  I know firsthand the frustration city  leaders face. Before coming to the Sen ate, I served 7 years as mayor of Boise,  ID. Every day I was mayor I struggled  with  complying with Federal man dates.  That is why the first bill I have cho sen to introduce as a U.S. Senator will  be  the Community Regulatory Relief  Act of 1993.  The bill is very simple. The bill re quires that any Federal law that cre ates  a  Federal mandate  shall  only  apply to a State or local government if  the Federal Government pays all of the  compliance costs with that mandate.  It is a simple solution. But it is a so lution tbat will work.  This bill will reduce the continuing  drain that the Federal Government has  placed on the States and local govern ments.  This Congress must end the practice  of imposing unfunded mandates on our  State and local governments and our  businesses.  I  say  this Congress must end  the  practice because previous Congresses  have known the problem but failed to  act. Thirteen years ago then New York  City Mayor Ed Koch complained that  the cost of implementing the require ments of section 504 of the Rehabilita tion Act of 1973 would cost his city $1.3  billion and still not address the prob lem  of handicapped  access  to New  York's transit system. Mayor Koch es timated  that  this averaged out  to a  cost of $38 per trip for each physically  challenged New Yorker who used  the  system. He stated it would be less ex pensive to pay cab fare for these people  than to comply with this Federal man date.  If Congress in 1973 had been required  to pay State and local costs of rules it  imposed, I am sure it would have found  a less expensive and more efficient so lution to this problem.  That is precisely  the  intent of my  legislation. My bill  requires govern",1993
144,,103,0.276,235,8,Mrs. BENTLEY.," Mr. Speaker,  fellow Mem bers of Congress, I come before you today to  celebrate  the achievements of some of my  youngest constituents, the third graders of Pot  Spring Elementary School.  This extraordinary class, under the guidance  of teachers Kitty Huebler and Fred Balmages,  created a super 8 animated film entitled ""Tour ing Baltimore with a Dinosaur."" The project  entailed many months of work, beginning with  a  field  trip  to downtown Baltimore  to view  some of the most famous sites of Charm City.  The students then made detailed drawings of  landmarks  including  the Maryland Science  Center,  the National Aquarium and world  fa mous Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and cre ated  their own clay characters  to visit  these  sites through the magic of animation.  Once  this phase of  the project was com pleted,  they began  to photograph  their ani mated  film. Each second of  film  required 18  pictures differing minutely  from one another.  This  painstaking  task  required  great  fore thought and discipline from  the 8-and 9-year  olds, but  their work paid  rich  rewards. After  being on display at  the Maryland Science  Center for 3 months, ""Touring Baltimore with  a Dinosaur"" was chosen  to  represent Mary land at the International Media Festival in New  Orleans, where  it was awarded  first place  in  the mixed media category.  My warmest congratulations are extended to  the creative and diligent students  involved  in  this project: Andrew Borowiecki, Chris Chen,  William Cromwell, Lindsay Cuprzynski, Brian  Fanshaw, Nicholas Graham,  Jessica Hand,  Jennifer Karp, Daniel Kim, Ross Marchant,  Michele Martin,  Bradley McGinty,  Jennifer  Musika, Emily Naughten, Hunter Peddicord,  Elizabeth  Reid,  Andrew  Rinehart,  Sharah  Rose,  James Ryan,  Sarolta  Serto-Radics,  10727  Jesse Tidmore, Brian Voris, Molly Winston,  and Joseph Zumbo.  In closing,  I would  like to congratulate the  principal of Pot Spring Elementary, Sandra  Fitzell. Many exciting and worthwhile projects  have been completed at the school under her  inspirational leadership. In addition to ""Touring  Baltimore with  a Dinosaur,""  these  projects  have  included  a  recent  fundraiser  at  the  school which resulted in a $27,000 donation to  the American Heart Association-the  largest  ever from a Maryland school.  Mr. Speaker,  fellow Members of Congress,  I feel fortunate indeed to have such an excel lent active educational  institution  in my com munity.  INTRODUCTION  REGARDING  SCREENING  OF  LEGISLATION  MAMMOGRAPHY  HON. BARBARA-ROSE COWNS  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 20, 1993  Miss COLLINS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker,  breast cancer is the second leading cause of  cancer death among women, affecting one in  every eight.  Ironically,  this deadly disease  is  treatable.  Studies  show  that  early  detection  through  mammography screening offers a reasonable  chance for treatment and recovery.  Through mammograms,  it  is estimated that  death  rates could be  reduced by nearly 30  percent. Yet  tragically,  few utilize this proce dure because they simply cannot afford it.  Today,  I am  introducing legislation that will  amend  the 1986  Internal Revenue Code  to  provide an employer a tax credit for the cost  of providing mammography screening for em ployees.  This incentive will encourage more employ ers to promote quality health care for their fe male employees.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this leg islation which better arms the working women  of America in their fight against breast cancer.

The  troop has been sponsored by  the Second Congregational Church  in Green wich, CT, since 1918.  On  this momentous occasion,  three  fine  young men were presented with Scouting's  highest rank,  the Eagle. Each of  them com pleted a project of community service in order  to receive this rank, which stands as an out ward sign of  the dedication  they have dem onstrated to their community.  ",1993
146,Senate,103,0.1,287,8,Mr. COHEN.," Mr. President,  I  am  pleased today to join several of my col leagues in introducing legislation that  will address both the underutilization  of one of this country's most valuable  resources-senior  citizens-and  the  need of students for adult role models  in the schools.  The National Mentor Corps Act will  authorize the use of intergenerational  mentoring programs under chapter 2 of  the Elementary and Secondary Edu cation Act. It will not force schools to  establish  such  programs but  rather  provides  the  opportunity  to  use  intergenerational  mentoring  as  a  means  of  improving  the  self-esteem  and scholastic achievements of our stu dents.  Few people would disagree that our  children could benefit from  increased  interaction with adults in their lives.  Unfortunately, many of this country's  children do not have an adequate num ber of adult role models in their lives.  Through no  fault of  teachers, all of  whom have dedicated  their  lives  to  helping children, many students can not possibly get  the attention  they  need in crowded classrooms.  The proposal before us today will ad dress  this  situation by  encouraging  adults, particularly senior citizens, to  go into the public schools and provide  a steadying hand to  those youngsters  who are drifting  in a  sea of apathy,  fear, and self-doubt.  Further,  this  legislation  seeks  to  capitalize on  the vast, untapped  re source  of older Americans who  are  seeking to maintain ties to their com munity.  The spirit of community service  is  one of  the  strongest  threads woven  through the fabric of America. Whether  it was fighting a  fire, raising a barn,  teaching the young, or caring for the  sick, our communities had to pull to gether and work for the common good  to survive and prosper.  Now, perhaps more than ever before,  we need to return to this spirit of com munity and unselfish sharing.  Today, we are at a crossroads. As a  nation, we are unsettled, unsure of the  future, and in need of a new dedication  of purpose. We all know these are not  ordinary times. Indeed, we seem to be  living  in  that age envisioned by  the  poet, Yeats, who wrote that:  Turning and turning in the widening gyre  The falcon cannot hear the falconer;  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,  The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  The ceremony of innocence is drowned;  The best lack all conviction, while the worst  Are full of passionate intensity.  Today we  face an enemy  that has  persuaded us that as a nation we have  lost our way, and most importantly our  will to do what is necessary to prevail.  The enemy  is a  clever, constantly  changing chameleon. It wears the face  of poverty, of greed and avarice, of in difference,  of  closed  businesses,  of  moral bankruptcy. It releases the poi sonous vapors of racial hatred, of hope lessness and despair, of drug-fueled vio lence, and of environmental degrada tion. It is an enemy that makes every one blameworthy and no one respon sible.  It is the enemy within us-the voice  that  seeks private gain over public  good, that promotes special interest at  the expense of the Nation's well-being.  Today,  the  involvement of all citi zens in restoring this Nation-in allow ing the center to hold, as Yeats put it- is absolutely necessary. We are losing  our sense of community, and we must  work to restore the fabric of our Na tion.  One can quickly list the problems we  now face, and no doubt forget a few im portant ones. Poverty, drugs,  teenage  pregnancy,  health  care,  unemploy ment, education, homelessness-these  are problems as daunting today as were  disease, harsh winters, lawlessness, and  mere survival to the earliest settlers.  I am very pleased that the legislation  being introduced today makes a special  effort to seek the involvement of sen ior citizens in the mentoring program.  In my work on senior volunteer pro grams,  I have been  inspired by  the  enormous contributions made by sen iors  to  their communities because of  their commitment to serving others.  This  legislation will  provide  the  means to work together to resolve our  problems, and recognizes how  impor tant it is to bind generations together.  I am very pleased to be an original  cosponsor of this bill. I hope my col leagues will join me in supporting this  simple but meaningful proposal.  By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and  Mr. CHAFEE):  S.  1008. A bill  to conduct a  com prehensive assessment of the Nation's  biological resources; to the Committee  on Environment and Public Works.  SURVEY OF NATION'S BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES  ACT OF 1993   ",1993
147,Senate,103,-0.212,287,8,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr.  President,  last  month President Clinton  announced  that he was asking the Interior Depart ment ""to create a national biological  survey  to help us protect endangered  species and,  just as  importantly,  to  help the agricultural and biotechnical  industries of our country identify new  sources of food, fiber, and medication.""  To establish this survey, Secretary  Babbitt has proposed an internal reor ganization within  the Department of  the Interior which would combine por tions of the scientific research activi ties of eight departmental bureaus into  one new bureau-a National Biological  Survey. I commend Secretary Babbitt  for his efforts ""to provide the scientific  knowledge America needs  to balance  the compatible goals of ecosystem pro tection and economic progress.""  I believe that better, more complete  information is needed concerning the  status and distribution of the Nation's  biological resources. I share Secretary  Babbitt's view that this type of infor mation will help prevent economic and  environmental  train wrecks,  such as  the Pacific Northwest forest crisis. And  I am convinced President Clinton  is  correct. Better information about our  biological resources is essential to sus tain production of  timber,  livestock  and agricultural commodities, as well  as other important economic develop ment.  Many important questions need to be  answered about the best means of es tablishing a biological survey within  the  Interior Department.  Secretary  Babbitt has put forth a  serious, de tailed proposal in an amendment to the  Interior Department's budget request  for  fiscal year 1994.  It deserves  thor ough  consideration  by  Congress  through  its authorization and appro priation processes.  Consequently, I am today, along with  the  distinguished  ranking minority  member of the Environment and Public  Works Committee, Senator CHAFEE, in troducing  legislation  that would au thorize  implementation of Secretary  Babbitt's proposal. My purpose  in in troducing this bill is to facilitate the  establishment of a national biological  survey, and to provide an opportunity  for  broad, public discussion of Sec retary Babbitt's proposal.  Consistent with Secretary Babbitt's  proposal,  therefore, the bill would re quire the Secretary of the Interior to  establish an office  to survey the Na tion's biological resources. The office  would be headed by  a Director ap pointed by the President, by and with  the advice and consent of the Senate.  The Director would be supervised by  the Assistant Secretary for Fish and  Wildlife and Parks and must, by reason  of scientific education and experience,  have demonstrated expertise in the bio logical sciences.  The purposes of the biological survey  required by this legislation would be:  First, to conduct a comprehensive as sessment of the Nation's biological re sources; second, to provide information  to be used in protecting and managing  ecosystems; third, to provide informa tion to be used in the sustainable de velopment of the Nation's natural re sources; and fourth, to help avoid and  resolve conflicts arising in implemen tation of the Endangered Species Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 1008  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ""Biological  Survey Act of 1993"".  ",1993
148,House,103,-0.236,313,8,Mr. BACCHUS of Florida.," Madam  Speaker, I  rise  tonight to share with  the House the results of a new survey  that was released today nationwide.  The survey was by Yankelovich Part ners, one of  the most reputable and  prestigious of all polling firms in this  country. The survey was a  survey of  American attitudes  toward  the space  program, which, as we, all know, is in  some jeopardy in this body.  I would like to share, Madam Speak er,  with  my  colleagues  the  con sequences of our ignoring the true will  of the American people.  The true will of the American people  is that we support the space program,  and the survey bears that out.  Let me quote:  Despite changes  in presidential Adminis trations,  a  new  political agenda  and  in creased attention  to deficit  reduction,  a  large majority of Americans continue  to  strongly support the U.S. civilian space pro gram, with a majority saying it should be ex panded.  Support was particularly strong for  maintaining a human presence in space  through such programs as  the  space  shuttle and space station, on which we  will be voting in a few weeks, and 9 out  of 10 voters said they view the shuttle  as  a  ""remarkable  technological  achievement"" and a source of pride for  the United States. In addition, 70 per cent favored a program to build a per manently-manned  space  station  to  orbit Earth.  Seventy-six  percent  of  those  sur veyed, and  these were registered vot ers, said  they ""approve of America's  current civilian space program,"" with  57 percent agreeing that America's ci vilian  space  program  should be  ex panded.  Moreover, 87 percent believe the ci vilian space program has a vital role in  allowing the United States to remain  economically competitive and continue  its status as a world  leader  in  tech nology.  Now, why do  they  feel  this way?  Americans  viewed  the possibility of  making new and important scientific  and medical discoveries as  the pro gram's most important benefit. Other  benefits include keeping  the Nation's  young people  interested and  involved  in studying science, math and engi neering,  and  increasing  the  under standing of  the Earth's weather, cli mate, and environment. In fact, 88 per cent  of  registered  voters  surveyed  noted  the value of using  space  sat ellites as a means of monitoring  the  Earth's environment, something we are  planning to do with the mission Plant  Earth.  American support for U.S. space ef forts  increased  in  relation  to  the  amount of information provided about  the program. When informed that the  U.S. space budget makes up only 1 per cent of the Federal budget, more than  half,  64  percent,  of  the voters  said  NASA's share would be increased to 1.5  percent.  In addition,  the number of  voters who want  the Government  to  spend whatever is necessary to main tain U.S.  leadership  in  space  held  steady at last year's all-time high of 63  percent.  Madam Speaker, voters also voiced  support for the space program based on  an international perspective. They said  the  space program was an  effective  means of building relationships with  other nations. Seventy-eight percent  suggested that the United States con duct  joint space missions with other  countries.  Over the next few weeks we will be  considering the future of the space pro gram in this House. We will undoubt edly have one more battle over the fate  of the space station. I hope that as we  do, we will keep these survey results in  mind. I hope we will remember, as ob viously  the American people  remem ber, that for every dollar we invested  in the space program, we generated $7  in additional gross national product for  the American people. I hope we will re member  that although  the past half  century two-thirds of our productivity  increases can be attributed to advances  in technology, such as  the space pro gram.  I hope we will remember that  most of the new  jobs that have been  created in the past decade have been  occasioned  by  investments  in  tech nologies such as the space program.  Certainly we must cut our budget.  We  are doing  that. We need  to cut  more. We will be cutting. It is all in  the President's economic plan. And we  will be doing more.  But as we cut, we must not be short sighted. We must not cut those things  that increase the possibilities of eco nomic growth in this country. We must  create conditions that would be condu cive to economic growth by reducing  not only our budget deficit but also our  investment  deficit. That means  the  new direction  that the President has  been talking about, means shifting our  resources  toward  those  investments  that will create a better future  for  America: children, education, transpor tation, other infrastructure and, above  all, advanced technologies such as the  space program.  TRAVELGATE  ",1993
149,House,103,0.426,313,8,Mr. GEKAS.," Madam Speaker,  and  now we have Travelgate. The news of  the last few days indicates that seven  career employees of the White House  were summarily discharged and  then  some kind of report issued and then the  FBI involved in an investigation; per sonal politics, Hollywood politics, pos sible nepotism, if you can stretch the  rules of blood and consanguinity far  enough. All kinds of shenanigans hap pening at the White House. And per haps they are important, perhaps they  are  just trial. But the one item that  stands out from all of the hullabaloo of  the last weekend is that the Congress  of the United States has no mechanism  in place to look more closely at this  situation.  What  am  I  referring  to, Madam  Speaker? As we speak here on the floor  at this very precise moment, there is  no independent counsel apparatus oper ating here in Washington. If this had  happened during the Bush administra tion, I tell you, Madam Speaker, there  would have been 50 Members of  the  House, primarily from the opposition,  of course, from the then-opponents of  the  President,  the Democrats, who  would have been lining up to sign ape tition to have an independent counsel  look at what was happening  in  the  White House in this type of situation.  But here  today  those of us  in  the  American public sector who are inter ested in determining what happened in  this Travelgate situation, we cannot,  at this moment, file a petition; Mem bers of the Committee on the Judici ary, in order to bring about the Office  of Independent Counsel to look at this  situation with close scrutiny.  And so we have to wonder, what are  these  investigations  that have  been  launched? What  is  the FBI doing  in  this situation at this moment? Should  we not learn more about it?

160,Senate,103,-0.313,482,8,Mr. BRADLEY.," Mr. President, I rise  today to introduce legislation to bring  new ideas and local energy to the enor mous task of protecting our Nation's  beaches. I am very pleased to be joined  in this effort by Senator LAUTENBERG.  For a long time, I've made very clear  to all my  interest and  love of  the  shore. This is where I come with my  family in the summer, as many other  New Jerseyites. This is where I have fo cused  a  lot  of my  own  attention,  whether it's to celebrate  the shore's  history and diversity by a New Jersey  Coastal Heritage Trail, or to address  less pleasant  issues such as oilspills  and medical was.te.  Last winter, the shore was battered  by a series of storms. A lot of property  was damaged. A  lot of beach simply  vanished. Partly as a  result of these  storms, we  have an ongoing debate  both in the State and nationally as to  what to do and how to prevent damage.  My own research tells me we have  yet a lot to learn about living on the  shore. My communities have watched  their beaches steadily erode. On our  coast, we've spent millions to counter  erosion, often with little to show for  our efforts.  In 1982 and 1983, for instance, I had to  get $12 million in emergency appropria tions  to save  the access road  to  the  Sandy Hook National Recreation Area.  We pumped sand on the disappearing  beach. By 1989, we needed another $6  million to do  the same thing. Today,  the Park Service is requesting yet $8  million more.  Frankly, we've been  very  simple minded in our approaches-relying too  often on pumped concrete or pumped  sand. We've got to get new tools, new  approaches. We need innovation and we  need it now.  Last year, my office was contacted  by citizens from Spring Lake. They had  been working with a local inventor and  some researchers at the Stevens Insti tute. Their small experiment used two  chains of concrete disks,  laid across  the beach, as a simple way to reverse  erosion. Lo and behold, the experiment  appeared to work: The beach grew.  Last  spring,  these  constituents  reached out to me to help enlarge and  better monitor the experiment. I want ed to help. But, other than requesting a  specific line item in an appropriations  bill, there seemed to be little way to  encourage the town's interest and in novative spirit.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  today in the Senate will change that.  My bill will target and encourage inno vation. It wm reach out  to commu nities, to counties, to States, and urge  them  to be creative,  to find a better  way to protect and enhance our shores.  Here's how the bill works:  The bill sets up a program, managed  by FEMA, which allows coastal mu nicipalities,  counties,  and States  to  apply for Federal grants. The Federal  Government  is  authorized  to  fund  projects for up to $500,000. A local cost  share of at least 25 percent is required.  The grants are intended for projects  that  target coastal erosion and are  considered innovative or experimental.  This is a program to develop new ideas  first and last.  A special preference is given to those  projects  that  use  natural  features,  planning, temporary or portable struc tures to control or counter erosion. If  we can, we want to minimize the foot print of these projects and encourage  flexibility. While an approach, for 'in stance, that relied on poured concrete  and embedded steel wouldn't be ruled  out, it is not the first choice.  All grants would include a provision  that required a complete analysis, at  full Government expense, of the long term impacts and impacts to neighbor ing communities. We're not trying to  find new Band-Aids. We're not trying  to steal sand from one beach for an other. We're looking for real solutions.  The grant money will be provided by  the  likely beneficiaries, with direct  safeguards. The legislation calls for a  separate fund financed by a $5 per year  fee on coastal community flood insur ance policies. However, this is not your  normal trust fund: First, if the money  is not spent appropriately and  is al lowed to accumulate, the authority to  collect  the fee  is withdrawn; second,  every  contributing policyholder will  get an annual accounting of the pro gram-this will help spread the word  about  the program, and its successes  and failures; and third, after 4 years,  the program stops and all unobligated  funds  are  returned  to  the  policy holders.  Additionally,  the bill calls on  the  FEMA flood insurance managers to de velop a list of approved erosion reduc tion techniques. FEMA is authorized to  allow appropriate flood insurance dis counts to those communities that ag gressively employ these techniques and  reduce the risks of erosion.  What  I've  tried  to do  is create a  small, responsible, and forward-looking  program. I've tried to make sure that  the funds wm actually be there to im plement the program. I've tried to safe guard those funds so they don't get hi jacked to other purposes.  I ask unanimous consent  that  the  text of the bill be printed following my  remarks.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 1024  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of J?,ep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

161,House,103,0.16,508,8,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr.  Speaker,  today Chinese human rights  activist Shen Tong is holding a press  conference in New York City to detail  the Beijing regime's ongoing violations  of human rights. In a shameful capitu lation to the hardliners in Beijing, U.N.  Secretary-General  Boutros  Boutros Ghali barred Shen Tong from using the  U.N. press club to brief reporters.  It is imperative that the world com munity take a strong stand against the  kind of repression that is so rampant  in China. The United States, as  the  leader of the free world, must make it  clear  that we  will  not  employ  a  minimalist policy  toward the Beijing  regime. Such a policy would certainly  be tantamount to coddling dictators.  Sadly, silent for months, the Clinton  administration  seems  poised  to  an nounce such a minimalist policy with  regard to China's most-favored-nation  [MFN]  trade status. The administra tion's consultation with Congress has  been negligible on  this vital human  rights issue. If the President goes the  route of a  loophole-ridden Executive  order, he will short circuit the oppor tunity for Congress to make it clear to  the Beijing  regime  that substantive  improvements in human rights are absolutely  necessary  if China's  pref erential trade treatment is to be con tinued.  Mr. Speaker, much more is at stake  here  than another broken campaign  promise. The women of China need to  know that we will not turn a blind eye  as they are forcibly aborted and steri lized. Religious believers must know  that we will not stand by as they are  beaten and killed for exercising their  beliefs. China's brutal dictators also  need to know that we will not tolerate  the imprisonment, torture, and harass ment of those who advocate democratic  principles;  nor will we  tolerate  the  gross abuses inherent in Gulag labor,  nor will we  tolerate continuing viola tions  of  nuclear  non-proliferation  agreements.  Mr. President,  I urge you  to work  with the Congress so that, together, we  can send an unequivocal message  to  China's leaders that business as usual  is not good enough anymore. Respect  for fundamental human rights is a pre requisite  for  future  favorable  treat ment from the United States.  ACT RESPONSIBLY TO REDUCE  THE DEFICIT  (Mr.  SANTORUM  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1993
162,House,103,0.338,508,8,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. Speaker, we  are here this week to debate the Clin ton tax package and the deficit-reduc tion package.  I wanted to make sure that all of us  here kept our eye on the ball of what  was really at stake, and that is the fu ture of  this country and  the deficit  that we are faced with.  A  group  of  fifth-graders  at Ben  Franklin Elementary School  in what  used to be my district reminded me of  that point yesterday when  they pre sented to me a check for $240.35, money  they raised at a bake sale and a car  wash to reduce the national debt. They  expressed their concern about the Fed eral deficit and what it will do to their  lives, to their future, to their opportu nities for them and their children.  I hope that the message is now sent  clear that we have to act responsibly  here in this Congress and in this city  to reduce this deficit.

164,House,103,-0.417,521,8,Ms. DELAURO.," Mr. Speaker,  today,  the  House takes the final step in the long road to  passing a strong NIH reauthorization bill. The  conference report on S. 1 authorizes research  which has  the potential  to save  the  lives of  thousands of men, women, and children.  In tensified  research efforts will be specifically  authorized  for  childhood  vaccines,  osteo porosis, prostate cancer, AIDS, and breast,  cervical, and ovarian cancer.  For years, women's health concerns have  been systematically ignored. Often overlooked  by  researchers and  left out of clinical  trials,  women are suffering and dying because not  enough has been done  in  the past  to  find  cures or treatments for the diseases that afflict  them. Therefore,  I believe the conference re port's provisions for women's health research  are an important and integral part of this legis lation. When  this bill becomes  law,  the NIH  will  be  required,  except  in  certain  cir cumstances, to include women and minorities  in NIH-funded research projects.  I believe so strongly in the need to include  women in this research because I have expe rienced past neglect first hand. By chance,  I  was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and by  luck  I survived a disease  that kills 13,000  women in this country each year. Since then,  I have joined other women with similar experi ences, and Members of Congress in working  to make certain that women's health concerns  are a central component of our national health  care debate.  This bill makes important strides in redress ing past neglect of research into diseases that  specifically strike women.  It authorizes $225  million for basic breast cancer research, $100  million for breast cancer detection and preven tion, and $75 million for gynecological cancer  research.  We cannot continue to ignore the diseases  that affect our daughters and mothers. We  must highten awareness that the diseases af fecting women have  to be understood, ana lyzed, and treated with the same care and dili gence with which we fight all other diseases.  The bill helps to do that. It puts some balance  into medical research, and provides millions of  American women with  the hope  that  their  medical needs may be met.  We must  invest  in  research  if we are  to  have healthier children and families. We must  make the commitment today so that we save  lives and precious health care dollars tomor row. I urge my colleagues to support this con ference report.  ",1993
165,House,103,-0.386,521,8,Mrs. MALONEY.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup port of the conference report on S. 1 , the bill  to reauthorize the important programs funded  by the National Institutes of Health.  Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I have mixed feelings  about the final version of this bill. On the one  hand, the  legislation authorizes generous lev els of funding  for a number of critical health  initiatives,  particularly  programs  affecting  women. On the other hand, the conference re port leaves largely intact the language inserted  by  the Senate which codifies the ban on  the  admission into the United States of immigrants  with the HIV virus.  First,  let me commend the gentleman from  California, Chairman HENRY WAXMAN, on put ting  together a bill which makes enormous  progress in several key areas. As the mother  of two young daughters, I don't want them to  grow up as I did, as my generation di~asi­ cally  in the dark about the major health risks  women face.  That's why I am pleased that the conference  agreement retains $335 million  for  increased  breast cancer  research and $75 million  for  gynecological  research. The bill also perma nently establishes the Office of Research on  Women's Health which will help ensure Fedhealth  research  of women's  eral  support  projects.  In addition,  I strongly support  the  funding  contained  in  the bill  for prostate cancer  re search, AIDS  research,  and  the  National  Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and National  Institute on Aging.  Mr.  Speaker, when H.R.  4  passed  the  House on March 10, there was a great deal of  concern  in  this body about language passed  by  the Senate concerning  the admission of  HIV-infected individuals  into the country. The  Senate provision would have placed a near total ban on  the admission of HIV-positive  people except where  the Attorney General  granted a waiver of 30 days or less to a trav eler visiting our country.  In my view, the Senate language was unac ceptable.  It codifies a policy, enacted  in  the  Reagan administration, which  is  universally  opposed by public health officials,  including  both Republican and Democratic Secretaries  of Health and Human Services. To single out  HIV-infected people as  the only  individuals  with a disease statutorily banned  from our  country is,  in my mind, an exercise in dema goguery and discrimination.  Chairman WAXMAN did the best he could in  the conference committee to change the Sen ate language, and thanks to him, some small  steps in the right direction were achieved. The  conference report allows the Attorney General  to grant waivers  from  this exclusion  to HIV positive visitors  to our country  for up  to 6  months. Waivers may also be given to perma nent immigrants with the HIV virus if they have  immediate  family members  in  the United  States.  Mr. Speaker, I support the NIH reauthoriza tion bill because offers so much hope for so  many sick people. But  I cannot support the  ban on HIV-positive  immigration, and  I sin cerely hope that the day will come when this  inhumane policy will be reversed.  ",1993
166,House,103,-0.473,521,8,Mr. WAXMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  back  the balance of my  time, and  I  move the previous question on the con ference report.  The previous question was ordered.

169,House,103,0.043,534,8,Mr. GILMAN of New York.,"  I believe his approach  is more  in keeping  with the original intentions of our military mis sion in Somalia.  In my view, this is not a case where self-evi dent truth is on one side and total error is on  the other.  Foreign policy is not a science. We should  not expect to find certitude where reasonable  doubt is about as much as you can hope for.  ",1993
170,House,103,0.377,547,8,Mr. MCCOLLUM.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  2128.  This bill, as  the chairman has so  aptly put it, simply reauthorizes  the  Refugee Resettlement Program for the  current fiscal year and fiscal year 1994.  It makes no changes in the Refugee Re settlement Program as it now operates.  The program, as he stated, is not cur rently authorized. The 3-year reauthor ization bill that the Committee on the  Judiciary reported  last year was not  scheduled for floor consideration prior  to adjournment of the 102d Congress.  Al though  funding  for refugee  reset tlement was  appropriated  for  fiscal  year 1993, the $381 million funding level  was $29 million less  than the funding  level for fiscal 1992. A supplemental ap propriation of about $15 million is re quired in order to allow the current re settlement prog:i;am to continue to the  end of this fiscal year. However, it is  my understanding that the Committee  on Appropriations has indicated it will  not approve  the administration's  re quest for this supplemental unless the  program is reauthorized.

219,,103,0.739,612,8,Mr. CRANE.," Mr. Speaker, the new book au thored by David Brock, ""The Real Anita Hill:  The Untold Story,"" has attempted  to put  to  rest the endless vilification of Justice Clarence  Thomas and  the near canonization of Anita  Hill that has taken place since Justice Thom as's confirmation hearings that took place  in  October 1991. The May 24, 1993 issue of the  New Yorker, contains a book review circulated  by  Representative  SCHROEDER,  ""The  Surreal Anita Hill,""  in which  journalists Jane  Mayer and Jill Abramson unabashedly attack  Mr. Brock's work by saying that ""he is skilled  at lining up facts to fit his agenda."" The duo  goes on  to say  that, although  the book has  been praised by  the  likes of Thomas Sowell  and George Will, as well as David J. Garrow,  the biographer of Martin Luther King, Jr., this  praise ""threatens to do a serious disservice to  history.""  In the Sunday, May 23, 1993, Washington  Times, American Spectator editor R. Emmett  Tyrrell, Jr., attempts to set the record straight  regarding  the book review. Mr. Tyrrell points  out that while Ms. Mayer and Ms. Abramson  attack Mr. Brock's objectivity,  they had  their  own Anita Hill book waiting in the wings.  I would  like  to submit  for  the  record Mr.  Tyrrell's article so that my colleagues may de cide  for  themselves who  is  telling  the  real  story.  [From the Washington Times, May 23, 1993)  ANOTHER CHAPTER ON THE 'REAL' ANITA  (By Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.)  The sudden appearance of a querulous re view of David Brock's best seller, ""The Real  Anita Hill,"" in the current issue of the New  Yorker magazine, presents me with an occa sion to note a point of crucial import to all  consumers of the news;  to wit, journalistic  ethics are almost nonexistent. Consider this  review by two Wall Street Journal reporters,  Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson (M&A). Jour nalistic ethics would demand of book review ers a modicum of disinterestedness, but M&A  are grievously compromised by self-interest.  For more than a year, M&A have  them selves been at work on a  book about L'  affaire Hill-Thomas. Mr. Brock's book scoops  them; and, unless one thinks the American  people's curiosity about Anita Hill and Clar ence Thomas is inexhaustible, it is a matter  of the utmost self-interest for these review ers to sink Mr. Brock's book. Hence, M&A  expend awesome energy depicting Mr. Brock  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  as an ""ideologue,"" politically biased and de ceitful. They even pooh-pooh his claim to  being  an  ""investigative  journalist""  as  though pursuant to that claim one must un dergo  some  esoteric  process  of  credentializing as does, say, a chiropractor.  Actually, Mr. Brock's impressive  journal istic output-along with  this book-amply  warrant the ""investigative."" As for political  bias, Miss Mayer has demonstrated hers in delibly  in her 1988 examination of former  President Ronald Reagan titled ""Landslide:  The Unmaking of the President 1984-1988.""  ""Unmaking"" goes a bit far, does it not, in  describing the 1988 condition of a president  who  left office with history's highest ap proval rating?  M&A are closet left-liberals, a type abun dant in American journalism. They expose  themselves by their proclivity for overreact ing to a self-proclaimed conservative, refer ring to him as ""ultra"" or ""extreme,"" and cit ing his conservatism as a mark of corrup tion, stupidity and general evil. That is how  they have responded to Mr. Brock, but what  is important about his discovery that Anita  Hill has lied is not his politics nor his reli gion or sex or dietary quirks, but his facts.  M&A question his facts, but in doing so it  is  they who are deceitful or, perhaps,  just  stupid. For instance,  they reprove him for  relying at times on unidentified sources, but  in Miss Mayer's ""Landslide,"" I counted no  fewer  than 48 unidentified  sources. That's  journalism. Mr. Brock never claimed to be a  historian. Journalists,  just as David Brock  and Jane Mayer, often resort to unidentified  sources. That is why we call journalism a  rough draft of history. But M&A are deceit ful in more serious ways.  For  instance, Mr. Brock has  found  that  Susan Hoerchner,  a  key Hill  supporter,  misspoke to disastrous effect in testifying to  the FBI that Anita Hill complained of Clar ence Thomas' harassment in  the spring of  1981. Miss Hill  never worked  for  Justice  Thomas until the fall. ""The possibility that  when Hoerchner was recalling a conversation  that had taken place a decade earlier she got  the date of the conversation wrong by a few  months  is not explored  [by Mr. Brock],""  M&A  sneer. Yet,  it  is! Mr. Brock dem onstrates that the conversation had to take  place before Miss Hill went to work for Jus tice Thomas. He cites Miss Hoerchner's fur ther testimony that she  left for California  about  the  time Miss Hill  joined Clarence  Thomas and did not speak with Hill for sev eral years.  In challenging Mr. Brock, M&A  fix  their  attention mostly on side issues of a subjec tive nature: Whether Mr. Brock's emphasis  of Miss Hill's radical politics and sexual con tretemps with students is overdone, whether  a former law associate, John Burke, had suf ficient authority to notify her that her work  at their firm was unsatisfactory, necessitat ing her departure. Here the real issue is not  Mr. Burke's authority but Miss Hill's verac ity. She denied that she had been told her  work was unsatisfactory. Mr. Brock identi fies Mr. Burke, who signed an affidavit, and  two other corroborating sources.  The most blatant deceit of M&A's review is  that  they  ignore Mr. Brock's Chapter 5.  There, in a thorough dissection of Miss Hill's  testimony to the Judiciary committee, Mr.  Brock lists Miss Hill's numerous false, mis leading and contradictory  statements-all  made under oath. That chapter alone de stroys Miss Hill's credibility.  Finally, M&A  deride  the  fervor of Mr.  Brock and his ""funders"" against Anita Hill.  Well, I was Mr. Brock's original ""funder."" As  May 25, 1993  editor of the American Spectator, I asked  him to write a piece that became the founda tion for his book. Here is a fact for M&A: the  piece was never supposed to be on Miss Hill.  I sought a piece on Washington leaks; spe cifically on who  leaked Anita Hill's testi mony  to  the  press. Without  ""fervor,""  I  turned to Mr. Brock out of curiosity about  leaks. Inadvertently, Mr. Brock came across  discrepancies in both the testimony of Anita  Hill and  the  legend  that she was a pious  Reaganite. That  is how  this book  came  about, not from ideological fervor, but from  journalistic curiosity. Evidence of deceit,  not politics, created it.  OPEN RULES, A FADING MEMORY  HON. NEWf GINGRICH  OF GEORGIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 25, 1993  ",1993
220,,103,0.377,612,8,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  bring to the attention of my colleagues an arti cle that was in the Wall Street Journal on May  21, 1993. The article  is entitled  ""Kangaroo  Congress,"" and I think that it is right on target.  Open  rules have diminished at an alarming  rate and along with  them any opportunity for  the legislative process to work.  With closed rules, voices all across America  are silenced. Republicans want the people to  have choices, and that can only be done by  having open rules.  KANGAROO CONGRESS  A majority of House members apparently  oppose the $72 billion energy tax and would  vote  to  substitute  a  cap on  entitlement  spending. But it's likely a vote on that idea  won't even  be  allowed when  the Clinton  budget goes to the House floor next Wednes day. When  democracy means  they might  lose,  the House  leadership prefers  to win  votes the old-fashioned way: They shut off  real debate and choices.  Any bill that goes to the full House first  passes  through  the 13-member Rules Com mittee, which decides how long the debate on  it will last and whether it will be handled  under an ""open"" or ""closed"" rule. An open  rule means the bill  is open to all relevant  amendments. A closed  rule sharply  limits  the number of amendments or denies them  completely. After President Clinton's meet ing with House Democrats on Wednesday,  there was general agreement his budget will  be voted on under a closed rule.  That means moderate House Democrats  won't be given a chance for an up or down  vote on replacing the energy tax with enti tlement caps, They are steaming.  Rep. Tim Penny of Minnesota said that by  foreclosing alternatives House  leaders are  ""ignoring"" the legitimate concerns of mod erate Democrats. ""It's an insult to say we  can't be part of the process,"" he  told us.  Former Rep. Dennis Eckart, a  liberal Ohio  Democrat who retired last year, decries the  increasing use of closed rules. He says they  are ""the most disturbing part"" of how the  House operates today.  The accompanying chart shows how  the  number of open rules has shrunk to virtually  none. This year, 10 of the 11 bills debated  have operated under the equivalent of a gag  order.  The first key vote on the Clinton tax in creases will come this Wednesday, when the  House will vote on whether or not to approve  ",1993
221,Senate,103,0.135,625,8,Mr. PACKWOOD.,"  I  did not  know  that.  Mr. DOMENIC!. For the two highest  brackets, the two new high brackets we  have just put back in the old law that  actually ruined the  taxpayers of this  country and produced a  fake  tax di vided for the American Government to  spend by saying you do not stay at the  same percentage, if inflation goes up 4  percent, you do not change, you do not  change the level of taxation. So that  means in a few years, if it went up 10  percent, you would add 10 percent and  say that is the new amount of tax on  top of 39 or 40 whatever it is.  The PRESIDENT pro  tempore.

223,Senate,103,0.429,625,8,Mr. GREGG.,"  I  thank  the Senator  from Oregon. I intend to conclude my  remarks in less time than that.  I thank the Senator from New Mex ico for his remarks and for his always  precise and rather devastating state ment of what this reconciliation bill  means in terms of new taxes: $6.35 of  new taxes for every $1 of spending cuts.  That is really an outrageous number.  people  few  It  What I want to talk about today is  who  is going to pay those new taxes.  We are hearing about it is going to be  the wealthy who are going to pay this  tax burden of $6.35 of new  taxes  for  every $1 of spending cuts. Well,  it is  not. It is going  to be small business  that is going to pay it.  Why  is  that important? Well,  it is  important  because  we  are  talking  about  the economic  revitalization of  this country. And what is the engine of  economic  revitalization?  is  small  business.  From  the period 1980  to  the period  1990, 4.1 million  jobs were created in  this country by small business. What  happened with businesses with over 500  employees? They actually  lost  jobs.  They lost 500,000 jobs.  There are 20 million small business  people  in  this  country  today,  rep resenting  56  percent of  the  private  work  force. And of  those 20 million  small businesses, 80 percent of  them  are unincorporated or are partnerships.  Why  is  that important? Well,  it is  important because it goes  to who  is  going to pay this tax. Because under  this  tax proposal,  subchapter S  cor porations and partnerships end up get ting a disproportionate share of the tax  burden  that  is going  to have  to be  borne here.  Why is that? Because they are treat ed as individuals. They are not treated  as corporations. And they are hit with  basically  five major  new  events  in  their fiscal life which are going to pe nalize  their economic prosperity and  their capacity to be competitive.  First, the tax rate of a small business  will go up from 31 percent  to 36 per cent, if they are subchapter S corpora tions and they have a  level of income  that qualifies.  Second, the wage on which their tax  is calculated for the purposes of FICA  and the hospital  insurance portion of  FICA will go up, and the cap will be  taken off.  Third, if they have more than $250,000  of income, they will be hit with a 50percent surtax.  People  say,  ""Well,  if  they  have  $250,000 of income,  they ought to pay  the 10-percent surtax.""  Let me remind you, we are dealing  with small businesses. A small business  can generate $250,000 of income simply  by rolling over  its  income  from one  year to the next.  Let us take a dress shop. For exam ple, a dress shop has $250,000 worth of  income. The owner of the dress shop,  the mom and pop dress shop, happens  to make $250,000 in salary. If they roll  this over  into  inventory next year  under a subchapter S corporation, they  are going to end up paying the surtax  penalty under this proposal.  In addition, we have changed  this  law-not ""we,"" because I certainly am  not going to support it-have changed  the calculation of the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, raising that rate  from 24  to 26 percent, and for people  under $75,000 to 28 percent. And as you  tend to compress those differences be tween the AMT and the corporate rate  and  the  individual  rate, you end up  with more people having to file, more  people having  to  file  an alternative  minimum tax calculation. And anyone  who has filed an alternative minimum  tax calculation knows  it is a night mare. There is no small business per son in the country who can fill it out  without  going  to  their  accountant.  That is an additional AMT cost. It can  be expensive  to a small business per son.  In addition, we put a  limitation on  itemized deductions-""we"" do not, the  President  does.  The  limitation  on  itemized deductions  is extended, and  that is going to cost small businesses  money. And you have the other things,  like the Btu tax, extending the gas tax,  eliminating  the meals. All  those hit  small business.  What does it total up for the small  business persons in this country that  they are going to have to pay in new  taxes?  Well, it totals a tremendous amount.  Quite honestly, if you take the rate in crease, if you take off the cap on Medi care, if you take the surtax, you are  talking about a 42.5-percent increase42.5-percent increase-in the amount of  taxes which many small business peo ple in this country are going to have to  pay as a result of this bill.  So when we hear all  this political  babble about how it is gc ing to be the  rich and the wealthy whc  are going to  pay this tax, let us remember that it is  really going  to be  the small business  people of this country who are going to  pay this tax.  And  that,  in some  instances, some  small business people are going to be  put out of business, and instead of cre ating jobs in the private sector through  the engine of small business; this bill is  going to significantly contract the ca pacity of small business to expand and  be the engine of job creation today in  this country.  It is just foolish to have targeted the  real core of entrepreneurship  in  this  country for  the major burden of tax ation in order to pay for  this largess  which this program proposes.  Really, what we should be doing  is  encouraging small business to expand,  encouraging small businesses to create  opportunity and to generate jobs. And  the way you do that, of course, is by  cutting the deficit the same way small  business people have to deal with man aging their businesses and that is con trolling the spending side of the ledger.  Limiting the amount of spending that  is going on at the Federal Government  is the way a small business would have  to address the deficit if it had one, and  it  is the way we should be addressing  the deficit.

228,House,103,-0.644,781,8,Mr. DELLUMS.," There is a great deal  of discussion of hollow military, and I  would  remind my colleagues  that at  this very moment as we deliberate, the  Department of Defense is engaging in a  bottom-up review of the military budg et. Right now, as we deliberate, at this  very moment there is an effort to look  at the issue of hollow military.  But  I would  also  remind my  col leagues and ask where  is America's  enemy at this moment? We no longer  live in a bipolar world. Colleagues, the  World War is over, the Berlin Wall is  down, the Soviet Union is no longer.  So we talk about hollow force. Where  is the threat? What is the immediacy  here? If we are prepared to deliberate  over how we pay for  these programs,  fine. But there is no sense of urgency  here. We are  the only superpower on  the face of this Earth, and there is no  power that immediately threatens the  United States.  We have been given a 10-year gift, an  opportunity  to  step back  from  the  mentality of the cold war when we dan gled our  swords and  threatened  the  American people with the notion of a  hollow force. Now we have time, mini mally  10  years,  to  step  back  and  rethink.  So  to  summarize, Mr.  Chairman,  while the programs that we seek to pay  in this $1.2 billion are laudatory, and  that is not at debate, the author of the  amendment stipulates that and so do  we, but what we are suggesting is what  was wrong with how the Department of  Defense came up with paying this, No.  1; and No. 2, how do you defend deficit  spending for one department and not  provide  that opportunity  for  deficit  spending  in other areas of extraor dinary urgency? And finally, what  is  the urgency that drives the need to pay  for  this,  this particular way, on  this  particular day in this particular bill?  So those are my remarks, Mr. Chair man, and with all due respect  to my  colleagues, I believe that this is a laud atory amendment, and I believe  that  we should support it and go back and  find a different way to fund this that  keeps us within the deficit. Or if you do  not lift the deficit, then let us all have  a  free-for-all, and then let us pay for  the kinds of programs we are all inter ested in.  ",1993
229,House,103,-0.265,781,8,Mr. MURTHA.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to strike the requisite number of words  and I rise in opposition to the amend ment.  The gentleman says we do not have  to worry about a hollow force. I talked  before about how we are starting  to  move toward a hollow force. I want to  say that in 1980 we had the same number of troops that we had in 1991.  In  1980 we could not pull off Desert One, a  small  rescue  operation.  In  1991 we  pulled off Desert Storm, a major oper ation, because the troops were trained,  the troops were equipped, and the mo rale was high.  We  could  face  a  $5  billion outlay  shortfall in next year's budget. I hope  that Members do not  think  that we  will be able to fund all of the programs  that they would like to see to provide  for national security with the amount  of money that has been allotted to us.  For  instance, we have  innumerable  requests for good programs. A major  program that we have to be concerned  about this year that takes big funding  in budget authority  is  the C-17 air craft. Our C-141's are worn out. It is  going to be a $40 billion program. Do  we need the C-17's tomorrow? No. When  do we need them? Down the road. We  are going to try to fund them.  The  destroyers  are  another major  item with big budget authority  im pacts. Are we going to be able to fund  them? I hope so, because they are cer tainly important to national defense,  and there are many other things that  we know are so important.  A couple of years ago people com plained because we put money in for  trucks because  it happened  to be  in  Secretary Aspin's State but the Con gress prevailed over  the Defense De partment. In Desert Storm, the biggest  shortage we had was trucks. Right now  the biggest shortage we have  in  the  military  is morale,  and  the biggest  shortage is training money, spare parts  are starting  to be short and we are  moving quickly toward a hollow force.  This supplemental is under the budg et caps. It is under the allocation. Last  year I went down  to  the Bush White  House, and they said the Somalia oper ation is an absolutely essential oper ation. Everybody said that except me,  and I said it is a good operation, but let  me tell you this, how are we going to  pay for  it? And if we pay for it the  right way, we will not deplete the mili tary resources and the quality of life of  our personnel. And President Bush said  oh yes, we will pay for it.  Right now we  could be  billion  short of money for this year, and that  is outlays, which  translates  into $12  billion and $13 billion in budget author ity. And that means we are going to  have a hollow  force under  these cir cumstances.  We have to decide: Are operations in  Somalia the right way to go? Sudan is  an operation that a  lot of people are  saying we ought to move in; it is some thing where we ought  to help. Some  people  are  advocating  going  into  Bosnia. I have been against Bosnia. I  do not believe it would be in our best  interest to go into Sudan or Bosnia un less we are willing to pay for the oper ations. We have to set up procedures to  decide when it is in our national inter$5  est and if we are going to do it under  humanitarian  circumstances, we  are  going to have to pay for it.  And just like last year, the domestic  programs are right up to the cap. We  did the right thing. We cut $2 billion  out of defense  in outlays and budget  authority under  the caps because we  felt they could stand that cut. Somalia  came up as an entirely new appropria tion, something that needed to be done,  something President Bush  requested  and something that President Clinton  supported.  I  had  grave  reservations  about  the operation because of  the  cost. Now  the same people who were  advocating that operation, do not want  to pay for it, and they say well, we can  pay for it out of other things from the  Defense Department.  Let me  tell Members,  there  is no  money left. The reason that there are  less high school graduates, the reason  there  is not money for  training,  the  reason that there is not money to keep  the quality of life for our military is  because we have cut back so severely.  And as I said to President Clinton, in  conclusion, I said, ""Mr. President, I'm  willing  to  support your budget  that  you have sent up to us, but you've got  to reduce  the deployment or increase  the amount of money that's available.""  And President Clinton said, ""You can  be assured we're going  to reduce  the  tempo of operations or we're going to  increase  the amount of money that's  available.""  Well, we  are  not  increasing  the  amount of money that is available. All  we are doing  is, under the allocation  last year, we are going back not to the  full allocation of up to $2 billion, but  taking $1.2 billion of that in order to  fund the military so that we will not be  back to the 1981 status where we could  not even pull off a small operation like  Desert One.  ",1993
230,House,103,0.414,794,8,Mr. EVERETT.," Mr. Chairman, this Andrews  amendment  to strike the $1.2 billion supple ment  for  the Department of Defense may  seem like prudent fiscal policy, but would un fairly leave DOD with the check for the Soma lia operation. This amendment  tells DOD  to  take the costs out of hide. DOD has been tak ing it out of hid for the past 8 years.  This morning's newswire had a couple of  stories  to  illustrate  how  lean  the  defense  budget has actually become:  Army aviators in the 4th Aviation Brigade  at Fort Carson have complained  they are  getting rusty because of insufficient flying  time, according to the Colorado Springs Ga zette Telegraph. The story goes on to explain  how pilots have complained that their flight  skills have deteriorated because of  inad equate training, particularly at night and at  high altitudes, and they are not ready for  combat. ""My confidence is extremely poor; a  lot of people would get killed if this battal ion went to war tomorrow,"" said one pilot to  an investigator.  Another story goes on to say-.  The quality of military recruits is begin ning to slip, especially in the Army, where  one key gauge of aptitude has dEclined dra matically. The Army showed a decline of  high school graduates from 100 percent one  year ago  to 89 percent  today. One expla nation is the cuts to the advertising budget  for recruits.  These two illustrations amplify the affect of  prolonged cuts to the Defense budget, espe cially  to the operations and maintenance ac counts.  If  this amendment  is approved,  that  $1.2 billion cuts come right out of O&M which  impacts the readiness of our troops. We can not continue to drain the defense budget and  expect the capability of our troops to be at a  Desert Storm readiness level. If the operating  budget continues  to  go down,  people are  going to get hurt. Let me remind you that one  of the Sea Hawk helicopters in the President's  fleet crashed last week, killing all persons on  board.  I urge all Members  amendment.

233,House,103,0.203,820,8,Mr. GUNDERSON.," Mr. Chairman  I  move to strike the requisite number' of  words.  Mr. Chairman, as a member of the  authorizing committee I would like to  discuss this issue because I think it is  important  that eyeryone put  this  in  perspective.  In so doing, hopefully,  I  can focus a little bit on why this is not  the  time or  the place, and certainly  this  is not  the process by which we  should try to accomplish this goal.  I want every one of my Democratic  colleagues to understand from the out set that I agree with you that we need  more funding  in  the area of training  and retraining in this country. There  can be no question that if we are going  to  have  a  global,  high-technology  workplace, if we are going to have de fense conversion,  if we are going  to  have NAFTA  retraining,  if we  are  going to pick up those people who have  fallen  through the cracks, we  in this  country have no choice but to dramati cally increase our funding in this area.  George Bush recognized that when he  was President, and President Clinton  has now articulated the same.  But that gets to  the very point of  what we are talking about today. The  fact  is, and  I pleaded with my col leagues on the Democratic side of the  aisle who  are  speaking with  their  hearts to take a look with their minds  at the authorizing language. You are  focusing your comments on title II(A)  which  is  exactly  the  disadvantaged  workers program under the Job Training Partnership Act. We just completed  a comprehensive rewrite of that pro gram. You voted for  that in the last  Congress, and what we did was we re quired that it be targeted to not one  but at a minimum of two barriers t~  employment. It meant you had to have  perhaps a  language skill and an em ployment  skill barrier. We  targeted  that money to the very people that you  want.  In addition to that, what we said is  that it is important to recognize that  yes,  in  the  inner cities some people  need income assistance and, therefore,  we allow under title II(A) that money  could be used for income assistance in  addition to the training.  Third, we recognized that there were  going to be disparities, whether it be  the Los Angeles or other communities  in dire need, and so we gave the Sec retary discretionary money to target,  as he saw fit, to those places greatest  in need in this country. It is no secret,  the Secretary of Labor today is your  Secretary of Labor. You  know him  well; I know him well. He has his heart  in the right place. I am sure if you take  your program to him he will make that  decision  on whether  your  program  ought to achieve special priority above  and beyond one of the others.  The problem with  this  is you  take  th~ disadvantaged worker  program,  wr1 tten, crafted and  targeted  to  the  very population you seek  to help, a  program that today, because of lack of  funds, serves only 3 percent to 5 per cent of the eligible participants, and  then you are going to take $25 million  from  that program, $25 million  from  the dislocated worker program,  and  you are going to move that money into  this particular area. That  is wrong.  That is wrong, and that is where we  ought  to go  through  the normal au thorization process. It is why we ought  to go  through  the normal appropria tion processes and come back  and I  will work with you.  I mean  those of  you on the Education and Labor Cam mi ttee know that I am not one who is  hostile to targeting our training pro grams to those most in need.  But this is not the way. This is not  the process.  ",1993
234,House,103,0.391,833,8,Mr. MCINNIS.," Mr. Chairman, we have  just done a quick calculation. I would  say to my respected colleague, the gen tleman from Iowa [Mr. SMITH], we have  942 jobs for $14 million under the num bers that have just been given to me,  and if you want to provide jobs in this  country, you take that $14 million and  you  leverage it on  loans. And if you  have decided we have all the money we  need  for Small Business Administra tion  loans,  I  suggest  that  the gen tleman take the $14 million and reduce  the deficit.  Mr. Chairman, how can you  justify  this? I am going to ask for a recorded  vote, because I want all of us to justify  to our constituents back in our States  that $14 million in Small Business Ad ministration money is going to plant  trees.

On June 6, Pastor Rouse will celebrate his  18th year as minister to  the congregation of  Mount Zion Missionary.  For 18 years,  the community of East St.  Louis has been blessed with the presence of  Pastor Rouse's endearing and selfless acts of  goodwill. Since 1975, Pastor Rouse has  led  the  church  in  several  community-oriented  service projects to benefit those less fortunate.  The church provides a ""Noon Day Feeding"" to  help  feed  the hungry and also maintains a  food pantry in order to assist families and indi viduals who face difficult times.  Pastor Rouse has been  instrumental in es tablishing an all-day program for seniors. This  one-day-per-week program enables seniors to  receive  information on aging,  including  ref erence material and assistance from different  government agencies and not-for-profit organi zations. The church program provides seniors  with a meal and organized activities as well as  companionship with other seniors and caring  church members.  Additionally, Pastor Rouse has helped those  who wish to  further spread the Word of God  by  sponsoring  scholarships  through  the  church. Scholars attend the American Baptist  Seminary in Tennessee.  While Pastor Rouse has played a very sig nificant role in helping the in-need community  beyond  the confines of his congregation, he  has also been a very dedicated spiritual advi sor, confidant, and  friend  to members of the  church.

This extension is urgently needed to provide  time for Allegheny County  in Pennsylvania to  develop  the  accurate  emissions dispersion  model necessary to draft a State implementa tion plan  for compliance with  the Clean Air  Act. Without an extension, western Pennsylva nia faces sanctions that could lead to the loss  of thousands of jobs and cost the region mil lions of dollars in Federal funding for transpor tation projects. But the sanctions do not stem  from a pollution problem;  rather  they will be  the result of the inability of scientists to create  a reliable predictive model  that would satisfy  the requirements of the Clean Air Act.

298,Senate,103,-0.231,976,8,Mr. GRAHAM.," Mr. President, I think  the discussion that has just been con ducted by the Senator from Kentucky  indicates the very utility of this type  of a disclosure of what would otherwise  have been ari unseen, incapable of re sponding to mail communication. That  is,  the opportunity to talk about the  facts  rather  than  the myth.  The  amendment I have has absolutely no  quality of preclearance or censorship  or any involvement in terms of what  the language of the communique will  be. It solely requires that the commu nique be filed-filed in two places: With  the Federal Elections Commission, and  with the secretary of state of the State  in which  the election  is being  con ducted.  The purpose of this is not to limit a  robust campaign, but to allow a robust  campaign  to  occur, with  everyone  knowing what  statements  and  rep resentations  have  been made.  This  leaves it to individuals, the media, in dividual  citizens,  to  know what  is  being  said-both what  is being  said  over the airwaves, what is being print ed on the page, and what is being said  by direct mail. And then have an op portunity  to  have  a  robust  debate  about them.  We  all  are  aware of  instances  in  which information which a candidate  or his supporters would have been woe fully unwilling to have put into a pub lic forum has been distributed through  these kinds of hidden direct mail cam paigns. This would just make that in formation fully available, public, capa ble of being  scrutinized,  capable  of  being commented upon. And then hav ing whatever impact it might on the  outcome of the election.  Mr. McCONNELL. Will  yield for a question?  ",1993
299,Senate,103,-0.374,1002,8,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President, one of  the advantages of representing a small  State is that you get to know so many  of the people who make our State spe cial.  I first met Bill Alley on an airplane  flying back to Vermont from Washing ton, and have had the chance of talking  with him on numerous occasions, and  seeing the results of his genius ranging  from artificial  limbs  to some of  the  most beautiful fly rods anywhere.  Recently he was profiled by a  local  newspaper and i ask to include that in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  so other  Senators  and  those who  read  the  RECORD will know of the kind of excep tional people we have in Vermont.  There being no objection, the article  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  [From the Free Press, May 17, 1993]  WHETHER THROWING AROUND A  JAVELIN OR  IDEAS,  INVENTOR PUTS OUT OLYMPIC-SIZE  EFFORT  (By Andrea Zentz)  A former U.S. Olympian  is finding chal lenges in the world of entrepreneurship as an  inventor.  Bill Alley, 56, a member of the 1960 U.S.  Olympic Team, doesn't like to dwell on the  past. With some prodding, he'll admit, ""OK,  I was a  three-time all-American and set a  world record in javelin in track and field.""  And he is still running strong. But it's not a  track that he's traversing. It's the competi tive world of business that challenges him. It  is the adventure of tomorrow that piques his  creative juices.  Ask Alley about the future, and he perks  up. He clearly has his sights set on tomor row.  And why not? As his late father, Francis  Alley, told him, ""If what you did yesterday  seems great, you haven't done much today.""  The advice seems to have a grip on Alley.  His  life has been punctuated with accom plishments.  The Stowe resident, who was Vermont's  Businessman of the Year in 1976, has a port folio  of  inventions  that  includes a  blood  pump used in kidney dialysis machines, an  artificial heart, an arrow shaft that set the  world record in distance in the mid-'70s, a  wind gauge used  in Olympic Games since  1968, a giant Polaroid camera, carbon fiber  tennis rackets and ski poles. He even  in vented a graphite bicycle used  in the 1975  Olympics, a gaggle of fishing fly rods, a drive  shaft and airplane landing gear.  He uses carbon  fiber,  a  lightweight but  sturdy material, for most of his inventions.  He also uses good old common sense.  He says that he often gets his ideas from  the strangest places. For example, take the  time he  tried designing a  fly  rod  for  the  president of Union Carbide. He had difficulty  with the design and found the solution in a  dream. He is never at a loss for ideas.  But Alley  tries  to remain  inconspicuous  about his projects and the tedious process of  turning theory  into reality. He  is a quiet  mover.  Trish Alley says her husband does not like  to draw attention to himself, but he finds a  lot of satisfaction in his work.  ""I think it's because when he was an ath lete, a lot of people wanted to be associated  with him because of the things he did, not  because of who he is,"" she said.  Much of his professional inspiration comes  from family. Alley takes his father's advice  seriously and still is setting goals. ""I've al ways had this desire to make a contribution  to medicine,"" he said. ""I'd like to help young  people become more mobile through the de velopment of artificial arms and legs.""  John Fago of Bethel  is  the  latest bene ficiary of Alley's artificial limbs.  ""It was the first time since I lost my leg  that I didn't need to use a cane, that the leg  was really working for me,"" said Fago, who  supplies prostheses to people throughout the  world.  Fago can't laud Alley with enough acco lades. ""He took stuff he learned in redesign ing the javelin, fishing poles, truck springs  and applied it to a specific problem .... He  loves a problem. You can tell he's someone  who has solved an awful lot of them in his  life.""  Alley, who has schooling in orthopedic sur gery and mechanical engineering, said his  academic background nurtured his interest  in helping people become mobile. He became  attracted to the idea when he was an athlete  visiting children's hospitals. His athletic ca reer opened doors, getting him past the ""who  are you?"" hurdles, he said.  ""He's a genius when  it comes  to  inven tions,"" said Garry Michaud of Research En gineering. ""It's just something working for  the guy because he can think up anything  and we get to make it, and it's fun.""  Michaud said Alley requires perfection and  gets it because of the way he treats his eight  employees at Research Engineering in Mor risville. Alley also employs two other people  at The Fly Rod Shop in Stowe.  ""He takes every individual who works for  him and he tries to instill in them a  little.  pride,"" Michaud said.  Alley moved from New Jersey to Vermont  in 1969 to start a business. He selected New  England because he  said business startup  costs are lower. ""It was an area where you  could work hard, and  the results of your  work would show, whereas in a more popu lated area you'd be competing with anybody  and everybody.""  The self-made entrepreneur says the secret  to his success is good timing and hard work.  ""I  think  that's part of how people get  ahead . . . because you walk the extra mile.""  Taking that incremental step to business  perfection  is nowhere more apparent  than  with his latest inventions. He's building a  machine to assemble a miniature part for a  hearing aid that will eliminate background  noises. He also just designed a walking stick  that transfers vibrations from  the stick to  the fingers of visually impaired people.  ",1993
300,Senate,103,-0.266,1080,8,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President, I rise  with great pride today to commend two  exceptional  institutions  in my home  State of New Mexico:  the Institute of  American Indian Arts in Santa Fe and  KNME-TV in Albuquerque. Earlier this  month,  IAIA and KNME-TV  received  the prestigious George Foster Peabody  Award for their collaborative work on  ""Surviving Columbus,"" a unique and  insightful documentary marking  the  arrival of Christopher Columbus in the  Americas and the subseriuent impact of  European  involvement  in  Indian cul ture. Told from the perspective of the  Pueblo Indian people, ""Surviving Co lumbus""  is,  in  the words of the 1992  Peabody  judges,  ""simultaneously an  important local document and an in structional  film  for  future  genera tions.""  This remarkable recounting of 15th  and 16th-century history-and 450 years  of contact-illustrates  the  dramatic  changes  in Pueblo  society  and  the  unyielding  endurance  of  the Pueblo  people and their culture. The program,  which relies heavily on oral tradition  and generations of stories told by Indi ans throughout Arizona and New Mex ico, also focuses attention on Pueblo  culture  today,  illustrating  the  long term  impact of  the Europeans upon  these  peoples  and  the  impassioned  pride which  keeps  their  traditions  alive.  I am proud of this documentary for  several reasons. First, ""Surviving Co lumbus"" marks  the cooperative pro duction efforts of two  important and  unique New Mexico  institutions de voted to the art. By pooling resources,  KNME-TV and IAIA were able to use  narratives of Pueblo elders, interviews  with Pueblo scholars and leaders, ar chival photographs, and historical ac counts  to  illustrate  the story of the  Pueblo Indian's survival and struggle  to  control  their own destiny. With  funding provided by  the New Mexico  Endowment  for  the Humanities,  the  Corporation  for Public Broadcasting,  the Public Broadcasting Service,  the  Rockefeller Foundation, and  the Na tive American  Public  Broadcasting  Consortium, KNME-TV and IAIA were  able to tell the emotional story of the  Pueblo survival  through  turmoil and  conquest.  Second, I  recognize  the cooperation  and participation of the Pueblo Indians  of New Mexico. As with most of Pueblo  history, accounts of the Spanish arriv al  and European  influence  are  pri marily collected as an oral history.  ""Surviving Columbus"" focuses on the  Southwestern Pueblo Indians because,  of all North American Indians,  they  have had the longest continuous con tact with Europeans. the documentary  not only tells a story of the past, but  looks at the Pueblo peoples of today,  their continuing struggle to determine  their own lives, and the strength they  draw from  their long history of chal lenge and perseverance. From this il lustration  of  the  Pueblo  peoples'  strength, we discovered the importance  of living a  life in balance, one which  recognizes the need for simplicity and  our  connection with  the  earth and  time.  Finally, I am proud that these  two  New Mexico  institutions, KNME-TV  and IAIA, had the courage to challenge  the  conventional  interpretat.ion  of  American history and  the  impact of  Columbus. Our traditional school text books  speak of an  uncivilized  land  which Columbus  discovered  and  ex plored. However,  the  Indians  tell  a  much different story, one of conquest  and enslavement.  ""History  is always  told from  the standpoint of the con querors,"" author, anthropologist, and  San Juan Pueblo Indian Alfonso Ortiz  points out. ""Hence, people who are con quered can't trust history.  It's not  their history; it's the history of their  conquerors."" In keeping with their oral  traditions, the program is visually and  audibly poetic. The story is finally told  in the voice of the Pueblo peoples. In terestingly,  ""Surviving  Columbus""  points out that many of the troubles  facing  the Pueblo Indians during the  16th century still plaque them today economics, land, religion, sovereignty,  and self-determination.  Last year, we marked the 500th anni versary of Columbus' arrival  in  the  New World. This year, I encourage ev eryone to explore new perspectives of  this event. As script consultant and  Santa  Clara  Pueblo  native  Rina  Swintzell expressed,  There are many worlds that exist in the  universe and the Pueblo Indian world was a  world that was very different from the Euro peans  in  terms of values and  lifestyle.  I  think we  need  to be  aware  that human  beings do have alternatives in ways of think ing, in ways of living.  KNME-TV and the Institute of Amer ican Indian Arts should be commended  for presenting the public with an alter native perspective of New Mexican his tory. Throughout  the State, citizens  can be proud of this cooperative effort.  ""Surviving Columbus""' is a work that  leaves a lasting impression on all those  who  view  it. Congratulations  to all  those involved with the project, a  job  well done.   FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE  HEARINGS ON  NORTHERN  IRE LAND   ",1993
301,House,103,0.155,1093,8,Mr. TORKILDSEN.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in opposition  to  the pro posed Btu tax which President Clinton  wants to impose on the American peo ple.  During the campaign, candidate Clin ton promised not to make the middle  class pay for his programs. Well,  this  Btu tax will make the middle class pay  and pay and pay. The energy tax will  cost $70 billion, mostly from the mid dle class.  And the middle class will pay more  than just the tax on gasoline and other  energy. Everyone will pay more, even  the poor, when  the price of a  loaf of  bread and a gallon of milk goes up.  I applaud the bipartisan effort in the  Senate to remove the middle-class en ergy  tax. The Senate knows  that we  need  to  cut  spending  first  and  the  American people want us to cut spend ing first. Hopefully the House of Rep resentatives will get the message, too.  Mr. President, $400 a year in new en ergy  taxes may only be a  couple of  haircuts for you, but  to a  family  in  America it means a whole lot more.  0  1220  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAK ER PRO TEMPORE  The .

302,House,103,0.506,1093,8,Mr. GRAMS.," Mr. Speaker, it's been  so long since the Republicans have con trolled  this House  that many people  may have given up hope that it would  ever happen.  Well, Mr.  Speaker,  there  is  hope  again. And we  can  thank President  Clinton, and  the Democratic  leader ship.  After all,  just think how angry the  American people are going to be when  House Democrats. vote today to stick  them with the largest tax increase in  American history.  Think of how angry  they will be  when  they  discover  that  Congress  found it easier to rob taxpayers pocket books than cut Government spending.  And  think how  they are going  to  react when they get stuck with a $500  per year energy tax.  Now,  I  know my Democratic  col leagues don't think  that  is a  lot of  money. After all, $500 only buy  two  Clinton haircuts.  But for average Americans,  today's  Btu tax alone will be devastating. And  it will be especially devastating to the  600,000 Americans  that are going  to  lose their jobs because of it.  Mr. Speaker,  I  remind my Demo cratic colleagues that the voters won't  forget. Ask George Bush who agreed to  a tax hike in 1990.  If you think you are going to have a  tough time explaining this vote to your  fellow Democrats in  the Senate,  just  think how tough a  time you are going  to have with your own constituents in  November 1994.

304,House,103,-0.215,1106,8,Mr. DERRICK.," Mr. Speaker, for pur poses of debate only, I yield the cus tomary 30 minutes  to  the gentleman  from New York [Mr. SOLOMON], pending  which  I yield myself such  time as I  may consume. During consideration of  this resolution, all time yielded is for  the purpose of debate only.  Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 186  makes in order consideration of H.R.  2264, the omnibus budget reconciliation  bill. The rule provides for 2 hours of  general debate equally divided and con trolled by  the chairman and ranking  minority member of the Committee on  the Budget. All points of order against  consideration of  the bill are waived.  The modifications in part 1 of the re port to accompany the rule will be con sidered as adopted in the House and in  the Committee of the Whole. The rule  waives all points of order against the  bill, as modified.  The modifications consist of several  technical amendments settling  juris dictional disputes or  correcting  the  text  and  two  new  titles  related  to  budget enforcement. The first title ex tends  the caps and amends  the Con gressional Budget Act. The second title  puts in place a tough, new procedure to  ensure  that we contain the explosive  growth of entitlements.  No amendment is in order except the  Kasich substitute printed in part 2 of  the report, debatable for 1 hour and not  subject  to amendment. All points of  order  are waived  against  the  sub stitute. Finally, the rule provides one  motion  to  recommit which may not  contain instructions.  Mr.  Speaker,  last November  the  American people sent us a signal that  they wanted change. The people want ed change from  the borrow-and-spend  policies of the 1980's. The people are  tired of government policies that lead  to high interest rates, high unemploy ment, and a stagnant economy.  President Clinton offered our people  hope for  the future  in  the form of a  plan to begin the process of restoring  the American dream  for us and our  children. Last March, this Congress ap proved, in record time, a budget resolu tion embodying  the blueprint of  the  President's economic plan.  That resolution called for deficit re duction of $500  billion over 5 years  through  a  combination  of  spending  cuts and tax increases, and instructed  13 House committees to write legisla tion cutting spending and raising taxes  to achieve those savings.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2264  is the fruit of  that effort and the centerpiece of the  President's economic plan, which is the  largest deficit reduction plan ever con sidered in our history. This one piece of  legislation will cut spending,  increase  revenues, and reduce the deficit by $343  billion over the next 5 years. The re mainder of the nearly $500 billion  in  savings proposed by the President will  come  through  cuts  in  discretionary  programs and reduced borrowing costs.  Mr. Speaker,  the people want us  to  hold the line on spending, and this plan  holds the line on spending. For start ers,  the bill contains  tough spending  caps limiting discretionary spending to  the 1993  level  in each of  the next 5  years. That's a hard freeze on domestic  discretionary spending, at current lev els, for the next 5 years. Never have we  frozen so much spending for so long a  period of time.  The people want us  to cut entitle ments. This bill cuts entitlements by  $97 billion over 5 years. These cuts in clude:  $56 billion in Medicare and Medicaid  cuts, on providers only;  $10.8 billion in the Federal employee  retirement program;  $5  billion  in  reforms  programs;  $3 billion  and  $2.6 billion in various veterans pro grams, to name a few.  This  legislation also  requires busi nesses  and  individuals  to contribute  additional  revenues  to deficit  reduc tion in an amount totaling $246 billion  over 5 years.  For  individuals, over 75 percent of  the taxes in this bill will fall on house holds with  incomes over $100,000-the  top 6 percent of all families. Fully 63  percent of  the  individual  taxes will  come  from households with  incomes  over $200,000.  The bill  imposes a new 36 percent  rate on taxable incomes above $115,000  for  singles  and $140,000  for  couples.  Families whose  taxable  incomes  fall  below  those  figures have  absolutely  in agriculture programs;  to  education  nothing to fear from increased income  taxes in this bill. For people with tax able incomes over $250,000,  the bill im poses  a  10-percent  income  surtax.  These individual tax rates will help re store progressivity and fairness to the  Tax Code.  The bill also requires the wealthiest  Social Security beneficiaries, who now  pay  taxes on up  to one-half of their  benefits, to pay taxes on up to 85 per cent of their benefits. This change will  more closely conform  the  tax  treat ment of Social Security benefits  to  that of other contributory pensions. I  would emphasize  that even with  the  change, only  those beneficiaries who  already pay taxes on their benefits will  be affected-fewer than one quarter of  all beneficiaries. Moreover, even with  the change, a  retired couple making  $60,000,  including $13,000  in benefits,  will pay  less  than  two-thirds of  the  taxes paid by a working couple with  that same amount of income.  Mr. Speaker, the only tax in this bill  which will  affect  the  overwhelming  majority of American families  is  the  energy tax. But this tax, which raises  nearly $71.5 billion and  is phased  in  over 3 years, is quite modest.  In 1994, a  family earning $40,000 per  year will pay energy  taxes  totaling  about $1 per month. In 1995,  that will  rise to $7 per month, and in 1996 to $17  per month,  according  to  both  the  Treasury Department and the Congres sional Budget Office. Lower  income  households are shielded from increases  by an expansion of the earned-income  tax credit and increased energy assist ance.  In addition to raising revenues,  the  energy tax will promote desirable pub lic-policy goals. Among these are en ergy  conservation,  reducing our  de pendence on foreign oil, cleaning our  air and water, and encouraging devel opment of cleaner alternatives to oil.  Reducing  oil  imports will  help  our  worldwide balance of payments. Even  with the  tax, America will still have  the  cheapest  energy  of any of  the  world's  top  seven  industrialized na tions.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation also re quires the business community to con tribute  to deficit  reduction. The bill  raises the corporate tax rate by 1 per centage point,  to 35 percent, for cor porations with taxable income over $10  million. The  legislation  closes  loop holes by capping the executive pay de duction at $1 million and denying the  deduction for lobbying expenses. In ad dition, the bill includes provisions in tended to  increase  taxes paid by for eign firms on income from  their U.S.  operations.  At  the same  time,  this  legislation  contains numerous tax breaks for busi nesses designed to spur investment and  create jobs.

305,House,103,-0.52,1132,8,Mrs. UNSOELD.," Mr. Chairman, on  behalf of the country, I  rise in strong  support of the reconciliation bill com ing from the President and the House,  and against the Kasich amendment.  Mr. Chairman, after 12 years of Republican  spend and borrow, after 12 years of Repub licans driving us  to  the brink of bankruptcy,  this Nation is engaged in a struggle to restore  economic health and fiscal sanity to our coun try.  I rise in support of President Clinton's deficit  reduction package. Listening to the guardians  of gridlock, you could not guess that we will  be voting on the largest deficit reduction pack age in the history of this Nation-$500 billion  over 5 years.  On the heels of a decade where we doubled  defense spending,  tripled  the Federal deficit  and saw our national debt balloon  toward $4  trillion, this President is engaging in real deficit  reduction. Over 5 years  there would be ap proximately  $117  billion  less  in  domestic  spending, $11 O billion  less in defense spend ing, $90 billion in cuts to entitlement programs,  and $3 billion in cuts to foreign aid programs.  For every  new dollar  in  new  investments,  there will be $3 in cuts.  This President is also restoring tax fairness;  75 percent of the tax increases will be on fam ilies with income over $100,000. Every tax dol lar in  the bill will go  toward deficit reduction.  The relatively small additional energy tax to be  paid by middle and lower income families will  be offset by lower interest rates and an expan sion of the earned income tax credit.  The President  is asking more  from  those  who can afford it the most. Under the legisla tion the richest 1 percent of American families  will give back many of the tax breaks they got  during the 1980's.  Besides leading us through the tough deci sions  to shrink  the deficit,  the President  is  tackling our economic problems. He is asking  for help to restore hope for the 7 million peo ple  in  this country who would  rather earn a  paycheck than a welfare check. He wants to  invest in people again. I look at our State and  see double-digit unemployment rates  in many  areas; I look at Skamania County and see al most 33 percent of the people out of work.  This bill includes $75 billion in tax incentives  for  investment,  jobs, and encouragement of  work effort, aimed at small business and at  communities and individuals currently suffering  from  low  incomes. That will mean more  real  jobs in the private sector.  By seriously addressing our Nation's deficit  problems, cutting spending, and  reprioritizing  current spending patterns which aren't effec tively addressing  the needs of the American  people, President Clinton  is  trying  to build a  strong  foundation  for our Nation's future. His  plan is bold, serious, comprehensive, and rev olutionary in its deficit reduction goals.  You will hear increasingly shrill cries that the  President's deficit  reduction package  is only  tax-and-spend.  There  is  little  credibility  in  those cries coming from the same forces who  brought this country to the brink of bankruptcy  and want to protect the wealthiest Americans.  They are trying every trick in the political book  to prevent  the President  from enacting his  platform. They are fighting  for the status quo  of borrow-and-spend.  Make no mistake about it. This is a deadly  serious battle. Our Nation's very  future de pends on it.  ",1993
306,House,103,-0.084,1132,8,Mr. VALENTINE.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding time  to me.  For the  last several days, many of  our offices have been  inundated with  calls  from  constituents  concerned  about  this bill. The concerns voiced  varied widely, but the clear message I  have received is that the people expect  responsibility  from  this Congress and  our President.  Taking responsibility for our Federal  spending habits is not going  to come  easily, or cheaply. This reconciliation  bill contains many provisions  that I,  frankly, do not like and would not sup port if considered separately. It offers  more than enough pain to go around pain for the citizens we represent and  political pain for us.  But, the medicine we are taking, bit ter as it may be, is the only cure avail able today for the deficit disease that  afflicts us and  that will  ravage our  economy if not treated. For years, we  have chosen Band-Aids and aspirin to  mask the symptoms. But it is time to  seek the cure. We cannot afford to wait  for some magic bullet  that might be  developed tomorrow or next year.  The reconciliation bill that we con sider  today . represents a victory  for  moderate Democrats who have asked  for, begged for, spending restraint and  deficit reduction for more than a dec ade. For  the  first  time  in political  memory, we are restraining all Federal  spending. We are  taking some of our  spending off of autopilot-before we  crash headlong  into  the mountain of  debt.  It also represents a victory for mid dle-class Americans who have too long  borne  the  weight  of  uncontrolled  spending, spiraling deficits, and ever moun ting debt.  ",1993

308,House,103,-0.209,1158,8,Mr. HOAGLAND.," Mr. Chairman,  a  number of our colleagues  from  farm  States are rightfully concerned about  the  impact  the  reconciliation  bill  would have on the agricultural sector.  Let me attempt to address those con cerns.  Unfortunately, the bill modestly in creases  the amount of taxes paid by  most  farmers. But after 12 years of  avoiding the tough decisions, and a na tional debt increasing from $900 billion  to over $4 trillion, the party is over. We  simply must have additional revenues  if we are to turn the corner on the defi cit.  Unfortunately, as we all know, we  cannot do it with cuts alone, although  I  certainly  favor making more cuts  than we are making and will fight for  those. But revenues are inevitably nec essary. What is important is that the  burden be shared fairly by all Ameri cans. That way-we can spread it out.  The average American will be  taxed  less than 75 cents per day by the energy  tax.  But farmers are high energy users.  Farm operations, unlike many other  businesses, do not have the ability to  pass on  the  increased costs resulting  from  the energy  tax. The Ways and  Means Committee began moving  the  bill in a direction to assure that the  energy tax does not fall disproportion ately upon the farm sector.  The  reconciliation bill  contains  a  number of provisions intended  to ensure that farmers are treated fairly.  Partial relief from energy tax. The  bill would exempt farmers from pay.  ment of the oil supplement on gasoline  and diesel fuel used on the farm. This  would reduce  the energy  tax paid by  farmers on such fuels by 57 percent.  Congressman DAN GLICKMAN deserves  the credit for bringing this idea to the  Ways and Means Committee with the  necessary supporting data, a study en titled ""Impact of a Btu Tax on Whole  Farm and Enterprise Production Costs  in Kansas"" prepared by Jeffery R. Wil liams and Fredrick D. DeLano,  two  economists from Kansas State Univer sity. We are hopeful  the Senate will  complete the exemption.  Feedstock exemption. The bill would  provide for a feedstock exemption for  nonfuel uses of energy sources. By way  of example, natural gas used as a feed stock to make fertilizer would be ex empt from the energy tax.  Increase in earned income tax credit.  The EITC is available to farmers with  lower incomes. The reconciliation bill  would increase the EITC in part to off set the energy tax paid by low-income  farmers.  Deduction of health  insurance pre miums. The bill would extend the 25percent deduction for health insurance  premiums paid by self-employed farm ers.  Expensing.  The  bill would  allow  farmers to annually expense $25,000  in  depreciable assets-a $15,000  increase  over the current $10,000 expensing cap.  The $15,000 increase would free up cash flow for farmers.  Tax-exempt  bonds.  The  reconcili ation bill would permanently extend  the  issuance  of aggie  bonds. Aggie  bonds are tax-exempt bonds issued for  the purpose of extending low-interest  loans  to beginning  farmers. Through  March 31, 1992,  loans in the following  amounts were made to beginning farm ers: Nebraska-$55 million; Colorado $17.8 million;  Illinois-$132.14 million;  Iowa-$106.87  million;  Kansas-$13.67  million; and North Dakota-$36.72 mil lion.  Additional  low-interest  aggie  loans were made in other agricultural  States.  Barge tax. The bill would cut the pro posed increase in the inland waterways  fuel tax by one-half to 50 cents per gal lon. The decrease would  reduce  the  costs  to  farmers  of  shipping  their  grains to market and of shipping com modities, such as fertilizer, to farmers.  What is most important to consider  is that low-interest rates will cancel  the effect of the energy tax on farmers.  In the study requested by Representa tive GLICKMAN, Kansas State Univer sity economists Jeffery Williams and  Fredrick DeLano, in a thorough analy sis, stated their conclusion:  If the [Btu] tax is used for debt reduction  such that interest rates for borrowed funds  fall, the average farm will benefit from lower  interest rates. For the average Kansas farm  a 2% reduction in the rate of interest paid on  the average farm debt would offset the in creased cost of the Btu taxes.  So you see, the most important thing  we can do for America is deal honestly  and  effectively with  the  deficit  by  achieving as much deficit reduction as  is politically possible in this bill. That  will calm  the markets, keep interest  rates low, make up for the cost of this  modest energy tax, and benefit all of  America.  I believe  that the above provisions,  all of which are contained in the rec onciliation bill, go a  long way toward  ensuring that the taxes which would be  levied on the farm sector are fair in re lationship to the taxes imposed on the  remainder of Americans.  The reconciliation bill also includes  provisions reported by the Agriculture  Committee  that would  reduce  farm  programs and save $3 billion over the  next 5 years. That includes increasing  the triple-base acreage on which crops  would not be  eligible  for deficiency  payments, as well as savings from the  Rural Electrification Administration,  which the President singled out in his  address  to  the Congress earlier  this  year.  The bottom line is that this bill is  tough but  fair.  I  strongly encourage  you to support the reconciliation bill.  ",1993

I might  also add if he votes for this turkey, he  is going to put at risk another job, and  that is his own job, as will every other  Member who votes for this misguided  tax plan.  Mr. Chairman, I would point out that  if every Member of this body was fac ing the electorate next week, it would  fail overwhelmingly. To prove that, I  point to exhibit No. 1, the current Sen ate race in Texas, where  the interim  senator, Senator KRUEGER, has gone on  record that he would vote against this.  He knows, it is a bad bill because he  has got to face the voters of the great  State of Texas within 2 weeks.  There  is a deficit problem  in  this  country. We do need to reduce the defi cit,  there  is no question about  that.  Fortunately, there is an alternative to  the Clinton tax plan, and that is the  Kasich deficit reduction plan. The Ka sich plan is not perfect, I admit that,  but it has one overriding benefit: no  new  taxes.  I want to repeat that, no  new taxes. It has been scored to reduce  the deficit over 5 years by $352 billion.  Mr. Chairman,  the gentleman from  Ohio  [Mr. KASICH]  asked unanimous  consent to amend the plan to bring the  deficit reduction up to President Clin ton's projected reduction, but that re quest was rejected by this body about  30 minutes ago.  We do need to begin the deficit reduc tion  process,  and we  do  need  real  change.  President  Clinton  ran  on  change but not this change. He actu ally ran on a middle income tax cut,  not a  tax  increase. Let us begin  the  process. Let us vote down the Clinton  tax plan and vote for Kasich.  The CHAIRMAN.

312,House,103,-0.432,1470,8,Mr. ABERCROMBIE.," Madam Speaker, my  home State of Hawaii  is widely known  for its  aloha spirit. The warm and gracious hospitality  of our people has  left an  indelible mark on  those who have touched our islands' shores.  In our State of Aloha, people of all  races,  creed, and  religion  live  in harmony. There  is  more than a sense of tolerance for differences  in our State, there is pride in our diversity.  Throughout  our  islands'  rich  history, we  know that the Hawaiians opened their arms to  welcome  those of Japanese, Chinese, Por tuguese, Filipino ancestries. These first groups  were  later  joined by Koreans, Vietnamese,  Laotians,  Micronesians,  and  many  other  groups from different parts of the globe. As a  Representative of this diverse State-the 50th  State in a nation of immigrants-I am proud to  recognize Asian-Pacific Heritage Month.  Asians and Pacific Islanders are the fastest  growing group  in  the United States and play  an increasingly influential role in American life.  Like  other  immigrant groups  before  them,  Asians and Pacific  Islanders have continued  the proud American tradition of furthering the  greatness of this country. They have contrib uted much  in  the areas of education, busi ness, and government. Without doubt,  they  too have strengthened the fabric of our soci ety.  Madam Speaker, as we  recognize Asian Pacific Heritage Month, let us also turn our at tention to the alarming acts of violence aimed  at the 7.3 million Asian-Americans in the Unit ed States. Let us not close our eyes and ears  to the report of the Federal Civil Rights Com mission, which  found  that Asian-Americans  ""face widespread discrimination  in  the work place and are often victims of  racially moti vated harassment and violence.""  As our country faces these times of reces sion,  it seems that there are those who have  found Asian-Americans to be a convenient tar get for their frustrations-scapegoats for these  troubled times.  The first wave of attacks included the 1982  brutal  death  of Chinese-American  Vincent  Chin  in Detroit by  two  laid-off auto workers  who were reported to have made obscene re marks  about  Asians  and  Japanese  cars.  Today, nationally syndicated columnist Clar ence Page notes  that attacks against Asian Americans are  less random and  include spe cific targets like community centers, senior citi zen facilities, and private homes.  Madam Speaker,  this ugliness shakes  the  very foundation our country was built on. This  great Nation was founded on the principles of  justice, equality, freedom, respect.  As Members of Congress  in  these United  States, we must take a strong stand against  bigotry and discrimination. Let us not  forget  how our country, only 50 years ago, slipped  into a moment of darkness when we  interned  our  fellow Americans because of their Japa nese ancestry and our suspicion of their loy alty to a nation they have never visited.  Madam Speaker, America was built by  im migrants.  Immigrants  from  the Western and  Eastern Hemispheres. The fabric of American  society burst with a rainbow of vibrant hues. A  strike against one group is a strike against us  all. We cripple ourselves by tolerating any act  of violence against any group. As Abraham  Lincoln once said, ""A house divided against it self cannot stand.""  As  we  recognize  Asian-Pacific Heritage  Month, let us be reminded that Asians and Pa cific Islanders have joined other Americans in  making America  a great Nation. A nation  where people of all races can live with dignity  and respect.  Aloha.  ",1993

Ms. Acheson  is highly qualified  to  hold this important post and should be  confirmed by this body without delay.  It is clear to me that Ms. Acheson de veloped a sharp legal mind through her  work as a  civil  litigator  in private  practice. However, what impressed me  the most about Ms. Acheson is that she  devoted herself to the kinds of pro bono  legal work that made the city of Bos ton a better place to live, despite the  heavy demands of private practice.  I was particularly impressed with Ms.  Acheson's 12 years of work as counsel  and a member of the board of directors  for Women, Inc., a residential rehabili tation program. for drug and alcohol  addicted women and their children. In  addition, Ms.  Acheson  actively  re cruited other lawyers to serve the com munity. She received an award from  the Boston Bar Association in 1991 for  initiating a pro bono program for law yers at her firm.  Ms. Acheson's commitment  to  law  and to her community will serve her  well as head of the office of policy de velopment. This office helps to select  Federal judges and U.S. attorneys. It  also plays a crucial role in developing  and advancing the Department's policy  initiatives. That means that Ms. Ach eson will be working with experts both  inside and outside the Department of  Justice to develop the Department's re sponse  to some of the most pressing  problems facing this country.  One of the most difficult tasks Ms.  Acheson will face is developing innova tive crime prevention programs  that  stress prevention and early  interven tion. As sponsor of the Brady handgun  control bill and a ban on semiauto matic assault weapons,  I  appreciate  keenly  the  importance of developing  sensible programs to prevent our Na tion's youth from turning to crime and  violence as a way of life. I believe that  Ms. Acheson's work on behalf of the  victims of crime and violence will give  her a real-world view of how to tackle  those very difficult problems.  I am aware  that Ms. Acheson has  been criticized by some for belonging  to a private club in Boston that cur rently has no black members. What ever you  think about  that criticism,  the fact is that it has generated an out pouring of support  for Ms. Acheson  from  the people whose  lives she has  touched,  including many  people  of  color. I was particularly struck by a  letter from the president of the Boston  chapter of the coalition of 100 Black  Women. She wrote:  I  cannot believe  there  is any question  about [Ms. Acheson's) commitment to equal ity and fairness. This is a woman who has  gone to bat for Roxbury Community College  as a trustee and many individuals of color in  this community. Eldie's list of outstanding  contributions  in Boston's communities of  color go on and on.

I would  also like to thank the gentleman from  Arizona  [Mr.  STUMP]  and  the  gen tleman from Indiana [Mr. BURTON], the  ranking minority members of the full  committee and subcommittee for their  efforts and  support.  In particular,  I  would  like  to  thank HENRY BONILLA  who  introduced  this  bipartisan  bill  along with CHARLIE  STENHOLM,  TOM  DELAY, and Veterans' Affairs Commit tee members FRANK TEJEDA and STE PHEN BUYER. This legislation would ex tend eligibility for burial in national  cemeteries to members of the Reserves  and National Guard who have qualified  service of 20 or more years.  Madam Speaker, under current law,  the only members of Reserve compo nents of the Armed Forces who are eli gible for burial in a national cemetery  are those who:  First, die under honorable conditions  while hospitalized or undergoing treat ment, at  the expense of  the United  States, for injury or disease contracted  or incurred while such member is per forming active duty for training, inac tive duty training or traveling to and  from such duty;  Second, are disabled or die from dis ease or injury incurred or aggravated  in line of duty during or en route to or  from active duty for training; or  Third, are disabled or die  from  in jury, but not disease, incurred or ag gravated in line of duty during or en  route to or from  inactive duty train ing.  However, members of  the Reserves  who have spent 20 years in a a.tate of  continual readiness to defend our Na tion at a moments notice are not eligi ble  for burial  in our national ceme teries.  Our Nation has long depended upon  and recognized the contribution of our  citizen soldiers. From the Minutemen  of the Revolution to  the valiant men  and women who served during Desert  Storm, our reserve and National Guard  members must satisfy the full mobili zation requirements of all Active Duty  Forces. He or she may be called upon  to perform capably in a highly com plex, hostile, and demanding environ ment,  to operate  sophisticated mili tary equipment, and to not only aug ment Active Forces but  to actually  perform a wide range of critical func tions whose skills exist entirely within  the reserve components. Additionally,  these dedicated individuals also honor  their obligations to family, home, and  civilian employers. During a  20-year  career the men and women of our Re serve Forces perform more than 2 years  of  collective military  service,  an  amount  of  time  equivalent  to  that  which currently qualifies active duty  veterans for burial in a national ceme tery.  Madam Speaker, in the report of the  Sixth Quadrennial Review of Military  Compensation  [6th  QRMC],  it was  noted that, with the advent of the All  Volunteer Force,  the scope, size, and  importance of missions assigned to Re serve components have increased dra matically. The Armed Forces now de pend heavily on  reservists as a  key  part of the total force. This was dem onstrated most  recently during  the  Persian Gulf war, during which a total  of about 228,000  reservists were ulti mately activated in support of Oper ation Desert Storm. Additionally, re servists stand ready to assist their fel low Americans when a  disaster hits  home such as  the flooding along  the  Mississippi  corridor,  hurricane  relief  along coastal areas, and  the mainte nance of law and order and provision of  humanitarian assistance whenever and  wherever needed.  In view of this expanded role, the 6th  QRMC recommended that all members  of the Selected Reserve, plus reservists  in any category who have completed  the  service  requirements  for  retired  pay, 20 years, under chapter 67, title 10,  or who  are  in  receipt of such pay,  should be added to the list of persons  qualified for burial in a national ceme tery.  According to the Sixth QRMC, exten sion of this benefit to such members is  clearly warranted. Their participation  requirements,  their mobilization vul nerability, and  the requirement  that  they be prepared  to report within 24  hours of notification underscore  the  fact that today's selected reservists are  continuous members of the total force.  National Guard and Reserve members  who have maintained a commitment to  the Armed Forces for at least 20 years  should also be afforded eligibility for  burial in our national cemeteries as a  reflection of the service they have vol untarily rendered their country.  Madam Speaker, as you are aware,  similar  legislation, H.R.  4368, which  provided the burial benefits specified in  H.R. 821 passed the full House of Rep resentatives during the l02d Congress.  Madam  Speaker,  I  urge  favorable  consideration of this bill.  ",1993

323,,103,0.162,168,13,Mrs. ROUKEMA.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  2668,  the Community Investment Dem onstration Act of 1993.  This demonstration initiative would  authorize HUD to provide section 8 as sistance  to housing projects where a  pension fund would enter into a part nership with a nonprofit, municipality,  or other entities to provide investment  funds for the construction, acquisition,  or rehabilitation of housing for  low and moderate-income families.  This measure had been a part of an  earlier suspension bill passed by  the  House addressing several housing ini tiatives. However,  the provision was  withdrawn at the time because of sev eral questions which arose about  the  proposal.  The most  important of  these ques tions involved the overall role of pen sion  funds  in performing social pur poses and the safety of these types of  investments for the funds.  Because these issues were pension re lated and not directly germane to the  Housing Subcommittee or the underly ing request for authorization, I felt a  hearing  by  the  Labor-Management  Subcommittee may have been appro priate so that these questions could be  discussed.  As the ranking member of the Labor Management Subcommittee,  the most  important concern with  this program  was the efficacy of these  types of in vestments by pension  funds and  the  need to ensure, through statutory lan guage, that nothing in this demonstra tion violated the rules and regulations  of the ERISA laws which govern pen sion funds.  Short of a hearing, I asked the ma jority and minority staff to analyze the  legislation and provide me any of their  concerns for the safety and soundness  of pension funds and whether or not  ERISA laws could be circumvented by  this legislation.  The  Labor-Management  staff  and  Members agreed that the program was  conceptually  sound  because  pension  funds are already investing in housing  projects in the private sect~r. but they  recommended adding additional statu tory  language which would make  it  clear  that ERISA  laws could not be  violated or circumvented  in carrying  out this program.  They also recommended, and I con cur, that pension fund investments, in  this demonstration, be limited to the  purchase of sec uri ties supporting  the  project or  that  fund  investments be  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-HOUSE  August 2, 1993  securitized. That clarifying  language  was added to the bill before the House  as  introduced by Chairman GONZALEZ  and myself.  Our Housing Committee's principal  concern in this matter is whether the  use of pension funds to help meet the  affordable housing needs of our citizens  is practical and whether we should au thorize HUD  to consider participating  in such a program.  Our other critical concern is that we  not authorize any program which could  I believe the use of pension funds for  housing  investment may be a  legiti mate use of private funds leveraged by  Federal housing assistance. This legis lation is also constructed in such a way  that I believe will not  jeopardize the  future of any pension fund.  Based on  this,  I  advised Chairman  GONZALEZ that since my principal con cerns about the safety of the pension  funds and the role of ERISA laws had  been satisfactorily answered, I had no  problem with this legislation.  Now, with respect to any issues be yond the safety of the pension funds, I  do not believe these are significant or  necessarily  relevant  to  the Housing  Subcommittee's decision  to authorize  this demonstration.  This  initiative  is  a  demonstration  program designed to test the feasibility  of using limited Federal rental assist ance to leverage millions of dollars in  private sector funds for housing.  This  legislation does not mandate  that any pension fund managers par ticipate in this demonstration. A pen sion  fund manager could not be di rected to make investments in projects  that would violate his fiduciary respon sibilities.  The  language  in  the bill,  as  rec ommended by  the Labor-Management  staff  and Members,  reiterates  that  point.  Members should keep in mind  that  this demonstration  is designed  to es tablish whether a nonprofit, or other  entities, a pension fund, other  inves tors, HUD, and the secondary market  can put together a plan to provide af fordable housing utilizing pension  in vestments in a safe and sound manner.  The success of any such partnership  will depend on the total assessment of  an application.  No  funds under  this demonstration  go directly  to any pension fund. The  section 8 assistance provided by HUD is  provided  to the project itself through  the project  sponsor,  usually  a  non profit. However,  the provision of this  assistance  represents  the  steady  stream of income which could make  such a project attractive to a pension  fund and the secondary market.  Mr. Speaker, I believe for these rea sons,  this  initiative  should  be  sup ported.  0  1520  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr.  WALKER].  ",1993
324,,103,0.581,168,13,Mr. WALKER.,"  I  thank  the gentle woman for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker, it is being said that this  is just a demonstration project. Well,  this demonstrates  a  truly bad  idea.  Here is a bill that is a true example of  the social welfare state run amok.  If you a take a look at this particular  idea, understand what we are doing is  we are beginning the process of divert ing pension fund money into public sec tor activities.  I think it needs to be understood that  the last great investment pool left in  the country is pension funds. Pension  funds is where private business and en trepreneurs get the money they need  for  expanding  their  business. When  companies want  to  find money to do  large, new projects, it is into the pen sion funds that they are going to find  the money that they need.  Now, what we have decided to do, evi dently, under this bill is to begin to di vert that money away from the private  sector and into the public sector and  make the pension funds into one new  place where we  can get all kinds of  money for social welfare programs.  I think we ought to understand who  it is that is at jeopardy here. The main  pension fund that is going to be used  for this money is the AFL-CIO pension  fund. They are the only ones who have  expressed any interest in this whatso ever.  I wonder how many union members  out there in the country are going to  feel  good  about  their  pension  fund  going into public housing rather than  into going into  investments  to make  their company more efficient, to make  their company more productive.  I wonder how many of them are going  to think that maybe keeping their own  job and having their company do a lit tle bit better job as a result of those in vestments would be a better idea than  putting their pension money into pub lic housing.  I wonder how many pensioners out  there, AFL-CIO union pensioners, are  also a  little bit concerned about  the  fact that this is putting their money at  risk, that money that they are count ing on for their retirement or are al ready receiving  in retirement  is now  going to be put at jeopardy in public  housing projects.  This is not a protection of the assets  of those folks. In fact, the main protec tion here sounds suspiciously like the  S&L protection that we got a few years  ago.  And so I think this is one truly bad  idea,  to  take  pension  funds,  divert  them out of  the private  sector  into  public sector and end up  jeopardizing  the pension  funds of union members  and  to  jeopardize  the  retirement  in comes of millions of pensioners across  the country, seems to me to be some thing we ought  to be demonstrating.  As  a matter of  fact,  this Congress  ought to turn this down flat and say  ",1993
325,House,103,0.32,220,13,Ms. PRYCE of Ohio.," Mr. Speaker,  last night, Jay Leno had a great com ment about the President's tax plan. If  you didn't know, it contains a provi sion making the small business taxes  retroactive to January 1.  Leno suggested that as long as we are  going back in time, maybe we should  go  back  to  the November  election.  That is not a bad idea.  But if we cannot go back to the elec tion, I suggest that my Democratic col leagues at least think back in history  when you raised taxes last. Think back  to the 1990 budget agreement.  What was  the result of that agree ment? Higher  taxes, higher deficits,  and slower economic growth.  How  is  this package different from  the 1990 agreement? It is worse. It will  hit small business harder, increase the  deficit more, and grind our slow eco nomic growth to a halt.  Mr. Speaker, the case is clear. Higher  taxes will not shrink the deficit. Let's  go back to the drawing board instead of  going back in time.

327,House,103,0.458,246,13,Mr. COMBEST.," Madam Chairman, I  move to strike the last word.  Madam Chairman, I cannot overstate  my opposition to across-the-board cuts  to this intelligence authorization bill.  To make such cuts by a percentage or  a number grabbed out of the air totally  undercuts  the  duty  of Congress  to  make  responsible,  informed decisions  based on a close scrutiny of the costs  and benefits of specific programs.  To my  colleagues who  favor  this  amendment I ask, what would you like  to see cut? Which programs should be  scaled back or terminated? Which in telligence targets should be dropped?  Should the FBI and CIA cut back on  their work against  international  ter rorists? Should we cut back on mon itoring the unfair trade and economic  policies  of our  competitors,  not  to  mention their efforts to steal us blind  of our technology and commercial se crets? Should we maybe slow down our  efforts  to stay one step ahead of the.  radical  regimes who  are  feverishly  working to develop nuclear, chemical,  and biological weapons and the missile  systems to deliver them to us? Perhaps  it would be better to tell our men and  women in uniform that the intelligence  community will not support  them  in  certain parts of the world? Or should  we just tell them that they will have to  accept higher casualties wherever they  are put in harm's way because we must  stretch out our intelligence resources  and settle  for  less accurate and  less  timely intelligence on the dispositions,  capabilities, and intentions of our foes?  Let me digress a second on that last  point. Yes, there are new global strate gic realities. Yes, the cold war is over  and communism as an ideology is dead.  But have you happened to notice that  our military has been pretty active the  last  few  years,  indeed, more  active  than  they have been  for quite some  time? Think of the huge military oper ation against Iraq. Think of the hu manitarian mission in Somalia. It may  interest some to know that 2 years ago,  in keeping with congressional direc tion,  the intelligence community was  asked to prioritize its missions and di rect  its resources accordingly. After  consulting with policymakers through out  the Government,  Somalia was  placed at the very bottom of the list.  One  intelligence  agency-stretched  very  tightly-decided  to drop  totally  its efforts to collect against the region.  At the time I think we all would have  applauded  this  decision  to  cut  the  ""nice  to have."" Within 6 months we  had troops on the ground there. Fortu nately,  that  intelligence agency was  able to revise its capabilities and our  troops had tremendous support. Our in telligence  community  preceded  our  troops into contested areas, identified  landing zones, neutralized some armed  factions, and, as a result, we suffered  minimal casualties.  This point illustrates the fact that in  the current world we must have an in telligence  community more  flexible,  resilient, and agile  than ever before.  We in the House Intelligence Commit tee have gone over this budget with the  proverbial fine-toothed comb and have  demanded  that  the  intelligence com munity justify every penny spent. We  are satisfied that the authorization bill  before us is as lean as can possibly be,  without acutely endangering American  interests. To  propose  an  across-the board cut with the thought that some  fat must remain is to play with the life  of the patient.  I would remind my colleagues that  President Clinton,  the man who  is  most  dependent  on  our  intelligence  agencies  to  tell him what  is  really  going on in the world, firmly opposes  further cuts.  Anyone who  is  familiar with  last  year's cuts knows that the intelligence  community  suffered  a  tremendous  shock last year. As I mentioned in my  opening  statement,  the  cumulative  cuts were haphazard and at a  level  which appalled Intelligence Committee  members from both sides of the aisle.  What were the results of those cuts?  Without discussing specific programs I  can tell you that operations and main tenance of some of our most critical  ",1993

I am  talking about  the  lucrative pension  program enjoyed by many Members of  Congress.  The congressional pension program is  a classic example of a Congress that is  out of touch with the average Amer ican taxpayer. On the eve of the largest  tax  increase  in U.S.  history, many  Members of Congress are participating  in a pension program that costs tax payers over $10 million a year.  Mr. Speaker, immediately after tak ing the oath of office, I  rejected  the  congressional pension plan.  As Members of Congress we  often  talk about the need for leadership and  fiscal  responsibility  in Washington.  Well, Members of Congress, if you be long to the lucrative pension program,  you can put your money where your  mouth is-eliminate the taxpayer con tribution to your pension plan or reject  the plan completely.

336,House,103,-0.256,675,13,Ms. SCHENK.," Mr. Speaker, for days I  have listened to some Republicans as sert there is a small business tax in the  proposed budget. It is time that some one  stood up and said  these simple  words:  ""That is not  true."" As every  Member  in  this and  the other body  should know, there is no separate tax  on small business, and saying so can  only be motivated by a desire to mis lead the American public.  The  truth  is most  small business  owners are taxed through personal in come taxes. The truth is over 90 per cent of small businesses do not reach  the  threshold of personal income  tax  increases proposed in the budget-over  $115,000 for a single taxpayer and over  $140,000 for couples.  The truth is, over 95 percent of Amer ica's small business owners will not be  paying increased taxes and the truth is  many will be eligible for tax cuts.  So I say to the critics of this pack age-speak against it, if you wish vote  against it, if you must, but don't dis tort the facts about it. The American  people deserve better from each and  every one of us.

337,House,103,0.505,675,13,Mr. SMITH of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er, last night the President addressed  the Nation to urge Congress to adopt  the largest tax increase in history. He  suggested that the Nation must adopt  this package before the economy gets  worse.  Mr. Speaker,  the President knows  that the economy has already gotten  worse. He knows that his so-called defi cit-reduction numbers are untrue.  He  is required by law to publish a  midsession  review  revising  economic  assumptions on which his budget  is  based and  the assumptions Congress  should know before they make this de cision on this large tax increase. The  purpose of publishing revised economic  assumptions midyear is for Congress to  have the best information available in  order to make decisions affecting job  growth, the economy, and jobs.  The President claims that the econ omy is strong enough to withstand the  contractions of the largest tax in his tory. However, the numbers he is with holding in violation of law would show  that the economy is weaker than pre viously stated.  This tax bill is the wrong plan at the  wrong time.  Mr. President, please comply with  title 31,  section 1106,  of  the United  States Code and give this Congress this  information so we have the best pos sible information when we make this  important vote on  the reconciliation  bill.

339,House,103,-0.31,1013,13,Mr. KLINK.," Mr. Speaker, I take the  well tonight to again make a plea on  behalf of adopted children and adoptive  parents. I also want to let the House  know that tens of thousands of birth  parents have also been needlessly trau matized by the judicial gutlessness in  the Jessica DeBoer case.  As an adoptive father I know that it  does not  take more  than a  few brief  minutes  to' bond with a  child. When  someone hands  the child  to you and  says this child is yours to raise, it does  not matter if the child was one that  you fathered or a child you are adopt ing. In my own case, our child was 5  months old and had been with us since  birth, when  the call came that there  was a custody problem. You have to go  through it, though I pray no one ever  has to, to understand how it feels when  the State, or county in this case, takes  an action  to remove your child from  your home and send that child to an  unsure future.  Too often the case turns on the fact  that some one had sex and then con ceived a child and that child is their  property. Children have  rights;  they  are not property. The DeBoer case is  the Dred Scot decision of the 1990's.  This must not and cannot be tolerated.  Clinical psychologist Jeree Pawl says  she does not normally testify in cases  like the DeBoer case. But that as an  expert  on  infants  and  toddlers  she  would,  in  this  instance. The doctor  says, and I concur, that parents and ba bies come to know one another through  feeding, diapering, giggles,  tears, hic cups, baths, stories, and kisses. Those  are the stuff of life for infants and par ents. The earliest life experiences are  the most profound in shaping who we  are. The doctor points out that this is  why abused children continue to suffer  after being removed from abusive situ ations.  Dr. Pawl states that even with the  youngest children being shifted from  one primary caregiver to another can  cause dramatic changes  in sleep pat terns, eating patterns, or other essen tial  functions. The doctor continues:  ''Jessica will have only her physical  self. She will not have her familiar psy chological self because that self is by  no means at the stage of development,  independent,  continuing.""  A  small  child  torn from  the  tapestry of rela tionships  into which she  is  so  com plexly woven,  loses not only  that fa miliar world but  herself. Removing  such a small child from everything and  everyone she knows results not only in  profound mourning and yearning  for  those whom  the  child  loves, but  a  numbing loss of any organized sense of  self.  Yet the attorney spokesman for the  Schmidts would have us believe the lit tle 21/2-year-old girl took control of the  situation and never even whimpered for  her parents, that leaving a loving home  and  two people who have  loved her  since shortly after her birth was like  going  to a babysitter's house  for an  hour. This change  is forever and will  forever scar the child Jessica Deboer.  Let me  repeat some  things  I have  said before. This is not about birth par ents' rights versus adoptive parents'  rights. It is about children's rights. We  in Congress must take action to make  up for the shortcoming in our judicial  interpretations. Leave no doubt  that  the best interest of the child is what  truly matters. That when the psycho logical makeup  is put at  risk  like  ",1993

The  event will take place at Eldredge Park in Orle ans, MA on Thursday. August 26.  It will  fea ture performances by singer-songwriter Judy  Collins, the Smothers Brothers, and comedian  Dennis Miller.  The goals of CAPE AID are twofold: to raise  funds  for housing,  transportation, and health  services for HIV and AIDS patients in the re gion; and to increase public awareness of the  effects of the epidemic within every commu nity.  I wish  to commend CAPE AID  cochairs  Marcia Galazzi and  Lee Sullivan,  and  the  many other Rotary Club volunteers whose  hard work and dedication have made  this  event possible.  CAPE AID  is an example of the  importal""!t  work being done by Rotary Clubs throughout  America  to  raise  public  awareness_ about  AIDS. Much of this work was  inspired by the  August 4, 1993  Rotary AIDS project of Los Altos, CA, which  has distributed  informational materials to 1.1  million Rotarians in over 25,000 Rotary clubs  throughout the world. The AIDS Project pro duced ""The Los Altos Story,"" an award-win ning 30-minute videotape documentary that re ceived  the 1990 Peabody Award  for excel lence in broadcasting. The film tells the story  of a local community that found  the courage  and compassion  to confront  the AIDS epi demic with humanity and common sense.  The Los Altos project was conceived by  Dushan ""Dude"" Angius, who was the incom ing president of the Los Altos club at the time  his son, Steven, revealed that he had AIDS.  Angius developed the project in the hope that  ""Rotary clubs would become models of sup port and understanding within  their commu nities, offering information, assistance to AIDS  patients, and educational programs for school  districts.""  Thanks  to  the work of Rotary clubs  from  California to the Cape, this compassionate vi sion is being realized.  SHARE-STUDENT HUMAN RIGHTS  EXCHANGE  HON.

347,House,103,-0.538,1286,13,Mr. GONZALEZ.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Committee  on  Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs  met its over $3 billion in budget sav ings through a variety of measures. On  the banking side,  the committee en dorsed  the practice of 29 States by  adopting a Federal deposit preference  scheme. Under  depositor  preference,  the FDIC and RTC will have a  first  claim on the assets of all failed banks  and thrifts, thereby increasing the sav ings to the Federal deposit insurance  funds. I note that is no way does this  permit Federal deposit insurance funds  to be used to pay uninsured depositors.  The committee also requires the Fed eral Reserve to transfer to the Treas ury $213 million of accumulated surplus  capital.  With  respect  to housing programs,  the committee's language will permit  the Government National Mortgage As sociation to charge fees for REMICS,  which are pools of securities backed by  mortgages guaranteed by GNMA. This  will put GNMA on par with Freddie  Mac and Fannie Mae. The legislation  also authorizes HUD to utilize ms tax  information  to verify  the  income of  participants  in assisted housing pro grams to determine their eligibility for  and level of benefits, but contains safe guards to protect the privacy of par ticipants and ensure  the accuracy of  the  information. Finally,  the bill re quires HUD  to accelerate the rate at  which the one-time up-front mortgage  insurance premium is recognized on an  FHA-insured loan.  These measures, adopted by the com mittee on a bipartisan basis, meet the  required goals. I thank the members of  Banking Committee and  the Budget  Committee for their help in achieving  these budgetary goals.  ",1993
348,House,103,0.141,1286,13,Mr. LEACH.," Mr. Speaker, I yield my self 50 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, it is the view of this  Member that a plan that raises taxes  and cuts jobs is not good for the econ omy and in this context I would stress  the radicalness of the change  in  the  Tax Code that applies to subchapter S  corporations. While  regular  corpora tions will have  top  tax rates  raised  from 34  to 35 percent-or effectively 3  percent-subchapter  S  corporations  will have top tax rates raised from 28  to 41 percent-an almost 50 percent in crease in tax burden. Instead of small  business being encouraged by Govern ment it will be stifled by the Tax Code.  Where does this administration think  new  jobs will be created? Instead of  raising subchapter S  taxes,  the prin cipal item on the table today should be  the indexing of capital gains for infla tion. Such an approach would free up  capital and free up land. It would cre ate jobs instead of joblessness.  Mr. Speaker,  in his State of  the  Union  Address  President  Clinton  sounded a clarion call for deficit reduc tion. His music was  right. Unfortu nately,  the programmatic script rec onciliation-this  bill-is  more  a  tragicomedy  than  romantic  thriller.  Instead of proposing that Government  set an example and tighten its belt, the  administration has called for the larg est peacetime  tax hike  in history, a  multi-billion-dollar increase in spend ing, and the postponement of any defi cit reduction until the third year of his  program.  What we are seeing is the develop ment of one of the great philosophical  demarcations of the century. At issue  with middle class Americans is wheth er  it's the  spending appetite of  the  Government that should be disciplined  or the pocketbook of the taxpayer that  should be  tapped. The administration  is suggesting that the deficit can be re duced tomorrow if we raise taxes and  jolt the economy with new spending  programs today. Skeptics like myself  believe that proposals for bigger Gov ernment are  likely  to deter  job cre ation and that postponing deficit re duction is a prescription for lower eco nomic growth. We  believe  the chal lenge is to address the deficit now, pri marily by holding the line on spending.  In the con text of a plan laid on the  table, it is fair for the President to ask  critics to outline a precise alternative.  Here is a preliminary reaction.  Rather than raise new taxes and in crease the size of Government, I would  suggest the economy would be better  off  if Congress  reduced,  statutorily,  Federal spending 21h percent in fiscal  year 1993, 5 percent in 1994 and 1995,  with Social Security, Medicare,  and  Head  Start  programmatically  ex cepted. Within  the  context  of  this  budgeting  restraint,  the  President  should be given the authority to trans fer up to 10 percent of any program's  budget to another. In making such pro grammatic adjustments the case for an  increase in education funding, particu larly early childhood and postsecond ary, is in order, as are modest jobs ini tiatives along the lines of the old Civil ian Conservation Corps, especially as  they relate to summer employment not out of a belief Federal  jobs pro grams lead to the formation of a larger  national jobs base but out of concern  that pockets of America are ignored at  society's peril. As long as the challenge  of communism remains on the wane,  the primary, but not exclusive, area  where old revenue commitments can be  reduced is in the defense arena. In addi tion to reducing spending on weapons  systems such as SDI and the Osprey, I  would suggest the case for a gigantic  fiscal commitment to the space station  and supercollider lacks persuasiveness.  On  the  tax side,  I would eliminate  the new tax break the bill provides for  real estate developers as well as  the  current right of merger suicidalists to  deduct  interest on debt assumed  in  large leveraged buyouts [LBO's]. Amer ican free enterprise functions best with  the widest possible distribution of own ership. Conglomeration should be pe nalized,  not  subsidized  by  the  tax paying public. I also have doubts about  tax breaks that are specific to indus tries, such as intangible drilling write offs and the oil depletion allowance. In  exchange for eliminating such specific  industry tax breaks and what in effect  is a conglomeration subsidy,  I would  lower capital gains taxes, preferably to  15 percent, and index capital gains for  inflation.  Putting aside the possibility of such  structural changes in the Tax Code, the  above macro-economic approach would  reduce the deficit over $200 billion in 3  years-$125 billion in spending cuts, $50  billion in projected program increases,  and $25 billion in interest costs. In ad dition, I have little doubt-but here we  are dealing with the conjecture of as sumptions  that go  into econometric  models--that the spur of lower interest  rates with disciplined Federal spending  and taxation would produce more tax  paying jobs than the Clinton program  and thus a larger tax base. Ironically,  it is not at all clear, despite the jobs  program rhetoric of the new adminis tration,  that  bigger  Government,  which  is  the  President's approach,  means a bigger number of jobs. What is  clear is that a program of deficit reduc tion without tax increases is most like ly to boost the total number of private  sector jobs. Hence, the fiscal deficit is  likely to be reduced with such an ap proach substantially more than the fig ures  indicated  through  spending  re straint alone and substantially more  than under the Clinton program, in the  out years as well as the near term.  Real changes are also needed in the  way Congress does business. The case  for a  line-item veto, balanced budget  ",1993

Let  me take my 60 seconds to allow a cou ple of my small business constituents  to speak, through their unsolicited let ters to me.  First, from a successful services com pany that has gone from 2 employees  to almost 500 in 6 years:  Like many  small  business  people, we  risked everything we had to get the business  started * * * [and] virtually every dime of  profit we've plowed back into the corpora tion. * * *since profits flow to individuals in  subchapter S  corporations,  the net effect  [will be] taxing our company profits at a 42  percent rate. * * * I don't need to tell you  what a 42 percent rate would do to our abil ity to hire new people and reinvest in our fu ture.  And here  is a  letter from a  small  manufacturer in my district who said:  Prior to President Clinton's economic pro posal,  I  had considered building an addi tional 5,000 feet of manufacturing space onto  our current facility, acquiring nearly $100,000  in new manufacturing equipment and adding  3 to 4 new employees. This is all on hold for  now.  Mr. Speaker, these are people in my  district who are in the trenches creat ing  new  jobs. You  have  heard  it  straight from them.  ",1993

352,House,103,-0.388,1364,13,Mrs. LOWEY.," Mr. Speaker, as we  vote on  this package,  I ask my col leagues to look to the future-not No vember 1994, but to the long-term fu ture of our Nation.  I,  for one, care  deeply about  the kind of Nation we  pass on to the next generation. I want  it to be the best Nation possible, one  that offers real opportunity to all: A  strong  economy;  affordable,  quality  health care; safe streets; and schools  where children flourish and don't have  to dodge bullets.  But I am a realist. We will never be  able to achieve those goals if we don't  first establish a sound fiscal base on  which to build. After more than a dec ade of tax and borrow policies, we have  to take bold, tough steps to reduce the  deficits that have a stranglehold on our  economy.  If  That is why I rise in support of the  conference report on H.R. 2264, legisla tion to begin the long-delayed task of  taking back control of our Nation's  economic future. The choice that con fronts this House today is between this  plan and no plan, between action and  gridlock, between positive change and  business  as  usual.  For  the  past  6  months, Congress  has  done  as  the  Framers of our great democracy  in tended when an issue as important as  our economic future  is at stake: We  have debated, we have caucused, we  have conferred, and  finally we have  produced a bill. The legislative process  has run its course. Now it is time to  act.  To those who urge defeat of this bill  and call, instead, for a budget summit,  I can only say that changing the proc ess will not bring us the fundamental  change this Nation needs. Past budget  summits have done  little  to  improve  our  fiscal  discipline.  they  had  worked,  this Nation would not be in  this fiscal mess today. We cannot seek  refuge from hard fiscal and economic  realities  in another round of closed door meetings. The American people  have seen enough process, now they de mand and deserve results.  It would be easy for any of us to vote  no, because we object to specific parts  of this plan. I am deeply troubled by  certain components of this bill, in par ticular the higher tax on a portion of  Social Security benefits. I  fought for  additional cuts in order to avoid rais ing taxes on some seniors, and I assure  you that I will continue to fight that  tax-which falls on many middle-class  seniors in my part of New York-and  replace it with specific spending cuts.  I also object to the retroactive na ture of some of the bill's tax provi sions. It is simply unjust and unneces sarily disruptive to make tax changes  applicable before  the date of enact ment. While the need for increased. rev enue to reduce the deficit must be met,  it should be done in a way that is non punitive and that treats taxpayers as  fairly as possible. There are also con cerns that a retroactive tax increase of  this magnitude could  severely harm  the  recovery.  The  administration's  plan to allow payments of taxes due to  be made over the next 2 years, without  penalty, is a help, but I remain very  much opposed  to  the  retroactive as pects of this package.  All of that notwithstanding, further  delay on action to bring down the defi cit will do far greater harm to our eco nomic future. Mr. Speaker,  the most  unproductive tax in the history of our  Nation is that $1,100 that, on average,  each  taxpaying American  sends  the  ms to pay the interest on our Nation's  accumulated debt. This money comes  out of our paychecks and does abso lutely nothing to address any of the  compelling problems facing our Nation.  This legislation is a first step toward  ",1993
353,House,103,-0.302,1377,13,Mr. MORAN.," Mr. Speaker, after 4  hours of Republican rhetoric, I think it  is  still  a  fair question  to  ask our  friends on the other side of the aisle,  what  is your real problem with  this  bill?  Surely  it cannot  be  retroactivity,  when most Republicans voted for Presi dent Reagan's 1981,  1984,  1986  retro active tax provisions. President Ford's  1976 Tax Reform Act increased the al ternative minimum tax by 50 percent,  and yet when it passed in October it  was retroactive to the previous Janu ary.  Certainly it cannot be out of concern  for small businesses, when you know  that as many as 90 percent of the small  businesses  in  this country could see  their  taxes cut as much as five dif ferent ways.  It cannot be out of concern for a 4.3  cent gasoline  tax, when by shopping  around between service stations you  can save more than 5 cents. Even if you  do not shop around, we are only talk ing about $30 a year for  the average  household.  And surely it cannot be because it  hurts  the elderly with  incomes over  $44,000. Your plan would have cut much  more from health care for the elderly,  69-059  0-97 Vol. 139 (Pt. 13) 44  retro and not to mention military and civil ian retirement pay.  It  cannot  be  because  it balances  budget cuts with tax increases. Presi dent Bush understood the need for bal ance. In fact, most of the Republicans  on  this side voted  for  that balanced  deficit reduction bill, and in fact it did  reduce potential deficits by up to $500  billion.  And it cannot be because it affects  only those with incomes over $180,000  instead of the middle class.  I think the real reason is because it  took  a Democratic President  to  do  what a Republican President did not  have the guts to do to act fiscally re sponsible.  ",1993
354,House,103,0.284,1377,13,Mr. WOLF.," Mr. Speaker, after hear ing that last speech, let me  just say  that I rise in strong opposition to the  budget reconciliation plan.  The reason  that many Members on  . this side and on the other side are op posed to it, I will tell my colleague, the  gentleman from Virginia, one, it does  not cut spending.  No. 2, it increases spending.  No.  3,  it  increases  taxes  actively.  No. 4, it does not even get us near a  balanced budget.  Clearly, this bill is an indication if it  passes of how  far out of  touch  the  White House and the Congress is with  the American public.  We  should be debating here  today  how much we are going to cut and we  should also be debating here  today a  bill to increase the personal exemption  for children  from $2,300  to $3,500  to  allow moms and dads  to spend more  time with their kids, middle class fam ilies to take care of them.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is not a good  bill.  Mr. Speaker,  I rise  in  opposition  to  the  budget reconciliation plan.  If this plan passes,  it will show how much  this White House and  Congress are out of touch.  In my office calls  about  this plan are running 9  to 1 against.  What we are hearing is cut spending first.  I share the concern of many citizens regard ing the size of the Federal budget deficit. Con trolling spending and balancing the budget are  among  the most critical  issues facing Con gress today. Continued high deficits harm our  Nation's economy. We must work to keep the  economy growing. We must  keep  inflation  under control, interest rates low, and investor  confidence high to create new jobs.  My concern, however,  is with  the direction  we are moving under the deficit reduction plan  as proposed by President Clinton. Under the  best of circumstances, this plan over 5 years  would reduce the deficit by only one third of  the estimated nearly $300 billion deficit today  and that's with $275 billion  in new taxes pro posed in the plan.  This is even  if  the promised spending cuts  in  the future come to pass. Billions of prom ised cuts have fallen by the wayside over the  past decade while  the upfront  tax  increases  are immediately enacted. Now with this budget  we have  the novelty of  retroactive  tax  in creases. Taking even more money out of the  private sector will only increase the current lag  in economic growth.  In addition, contrary to claims that the Presi dent's deficit  reduction  program will  create  jobs and grow the economy, the plan  is void  of incentives to save, invest, or start up new  businesses  and  saddles  small  businesses,  which are expected  to create 75 percent of  new jobs, with devastating tax increases that  will result in small businesses paying a higher  tax rate than large multinational corporations.  This  is not  the kind of change Americans  are demanding; it is more of the same tax and  spend status quo. A budget bill which forces  middle-income  Americans,  senior. citizens,  small-businesses and farmers  in  this country  to send more tax money to the Federal Gov ernment so that Washington can continue its  spending spree is not legislation which will get  my vote.  Americans are not taxed too little; the Gov ernment spends too much. Cut spending first.  ",1993
355,House,103,0.315,1390,13,Mr. HOBSON.," Mr. Speaker, Ameri cans know a bad budget when they see  one. They have seen  the President's  budget, and an overwhelming majority  of American&-about  90  percent-op pose it. People back home have serious  problems with this bill, and for good  reason.  The President's budget  is a  flawed  budget. Given the magnitude of govern ment waste, it is a disgrace to go back  to Americans and demand more taxes,  moreover, to demand more taxes from  a time predating this administration.  Retroactive  taxes are  irresponsible  and  inflationary, and  they will only  serve to slow our recovering economy.  This budget seeks to reduce the defi cit with about a 50/50 mix of taxes and  spending cuts. Or should I say imagi nary  spending  cuts.  The  President  wants to reduce the deficit with cuts in  the future, 4 or 5 years from now. But  if a majority of Members in Congress  refuse to accept cuts now, what makes  the President think they will be will ing to do so 5 years from now?  The majority has excluded Repub licans during the budget process. As a  member of the House Budget Commit tee,  I know that Republicans worked  very hard  to be  included. We offered  over 30 amendments to the President's  tax bill, many of which were praised by  Democrats, but none of which were ac cepted.  During that time absolutely no effort  was made by  the majority  to secure  Republican support or to  incorporate  our  suggestions which would  have  made  this  bill  acceptable.  Because  Democrats cannot deny that they shut  us out, their only defense is to portray  out opposition as gridlock.  I strongly support deficit reduction,  and so does every member here whoop poses this bill. But the responsibility of  Congress is to remain responsive to the  American people, and  today on  this  vote, the majority in Congress has for gotten who they represent.  If we do not have a clear majority  today to pass this bill, that's not a fail ure on  the part of Congress or  the  President. It is an opportunity to re consider this issue and work to develop  a truly bipartisan bill that responds to  what American people want-to cut  spending first.  ",1993
356,House,103,0.338,1390,13,Mr. HOKE.," Mr. Speaker, this vote is  on the budget. Budgets are about num bers. We have all heard more numbers  today than we care to remember. But I  am going to share with my colleagues  the very most important numbers that  there are in this budget, and these are  the ones  for anyone who  takes seri ously the meaning of the title: ""Rep resentative.""  The day after the State of the Union  Address calls in to my office were three  to one against the President's program.  The day after the Budget Act and dur ing the debate of the Budget Act, early  April, it was four to one against the  President's program. Budget reconcili ation, late May, five to one against the  reconciliation program. Conference re port, the last 3 days, over a  thousand  phone calls, seven to one against.  The President seems to think that if  he could just communicate this clear ly, people would understand it. If he  could just get inside their living rooms,  sit down with them, have a cup of cof fee, make them understand, they would  buy into this.  Then he got a better communicator.  He communicated it brilliantly.  The fact  is, Mr. Speaker,  the more  they understand, the less they like.  ",1993
357,,103,0.458,1442,13,Mr. COMBEST.," Mr. Speaker, supporters of  the tax bill have been saying that special inter est will cause its defeat. They are right.  I am  not ashamed  to admit  that my vote against  this bill is due to special interest. The special  interest of  the 566,217 people who elected  me. The people of the 19th district who have  made their views  loud and clear-cut spend ing first.  This farce of a deficit reduction bill contains  the largest tax increase in history and will still  result  in a trillion dollar increase on our na tional debt. The real kicker is taxes will be ret roactive  to January 1 , 1993. Where are  the  spending cuts? They aren't retroactive  that's  for sure. They are years down the road with  80 percent of cuts coming after the 1996 pres idential elections.  The sad truth  is Congress doesn't have a  clue how to read a map and gets lost before  the route to spending cuts are found.  No wonder the American people have  lost  faith in this institution. This bill is a slap in the  face to the taxpayers of this country. This isn't  the change the American people had in mind  last November and this isn't responsible fiscal  policy. We cannot continue to run to the tax payers to bail out Congress for their fiscal mis management-they will not stand for the con tinued misuse of  their hard earned dollars.  Now is the time to do what the American tax payers have demanded-cut spending first.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  DISABILITY RIGHTS IN AMERICAN  FOREIGN POLICY  HON. STENY H.

358,,103,-0.362,1442,13,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  in celebration of what has become an annual  tradition for the Indian-American community in  Jersey City, NJ: the hoisting of the Indian flag  with  the American  flag on  Indian  Independ ence Day.  This annual event is sponsored by the Fed eration of Indian Associations, NJ, an umbrella  organization dedicated  to nonprofit, nonpoliti cal, educational, social, and charitable  rep resentation of the interests of the Indian-Amer ican community  in  the State of New Jersey.  The federation  is funded by  the  International  Mahatma Gandhi Association, founded by Mr.  Hardyal Singh of Jersey City in 1980.  This year, on August 16, at 2 p.m.,  the  member organizations of  the  federation will  gather at city hall in Jersey City for this event,  celebrating  the  contributions  and  achieve ments of the Indian-American community, and  our continuing friendship with the world's most  populous democracy.  I am sure that my colleagues join me in ex tending our best wishes to those who will be  joining  in  the  festivities on  Indian  Independ ence Day.  SALUTE TO VENTURA TODAY  HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor ""Ventura Today,"" Ventura County, CA's,  first weekly television program that highlights  topical  issues and prominent people  in busi ness, government, and the media.  Public affairs television programming plays  a major role both nationally and locally in help ing the American people better understand the  issues of the day.

360,Senate,103,0.407,19,20,Mr. COVERDELL.," Mr. President,  I  appreciate the senior Senator yielding  to me. I also compliment him on the  effort that he and his staff have made  over these past several months to con sult on  this momentous agreement,  and it is an honor  to  join him here  today in a mutual statement in sup port of the North American Free-Trade  Agreement.  Mr. President, this has not been an  easy decision.  It  is a  very  complex  agreement. It has many ramifications  for our State, but I believe that this  agreement  represents a defining mo ment for the people of our Nation, for  all the families and businesses of our  Nation, a defining moment for the fu ture of our Nation.  If there was  ever a  decision  that  called  on  fair-minded  leadership,  it  deals with this difficult and complex  treaty, the North American Free-Trade  Agreement.  I am hoping that the  leadership of  this Nation will step forward at all lev els and understand the very far-reach ing ramifications that this agreement  will  have  for our country,  for  this  hemisphere, and for our position and  stature in the world as we approach the  new century.  The United States, by anyone's defi nition, is the only superpower now in  the world. Not only has  that super power status been founded in our eco nomic power but, in great part, it has  been defined by our immense military  strength. The muscle,  the military  muscle, of the United States has done  perhaps more  than any other single  thing  to define  a  peaceful and civil  order in our world in the last half cen tury.  The military muscle of the United  States is still a preeminent factor in  determining the standing and order in  our world. But I  think it ought to be  clear to all of us that for the United  States to continue to hold the status of  superpower, it must be viewed and it  must be framed in economic muscle.  The battles of the future, the defini tion of the world in the next century,  will be determined by economic mus cle, economic capacity, economic abil ity to compete.  We have done extensive research on  this agreement, as it pertains to Geor gia and prepared a white paper that has  led to the decision we are making here  today.  I see Georgia, my State, as a  trade  opportunity State. Fortunately,  the  gross State product of  the State of  Georgia  is $130 billion. After assem bling  almost  limitless data  on  the  agreement, we have concluded that $120  billion of the $130 billion gross State  product will be enhanced, broadened,  made better by the treaty. That is 92  percent of our gross State product that  will be  improved,  that will point  to  new opportunity, new  jobs, new busi nesses.  I think it is worthy of note that our  State is a port State, a gateway to our  hemisphere, and that contributes sub stantially  to  the  decision we  have  made with regard to the benefits that  will accrue to our State as a result of  the North American Free-Trade Agree ment.  Canada and Mexico are the first and  third largest recipients of exports from  the State of Georgia. Already, 45,000  Georgians are employed because of ex ports to these two countries. Every evi dence we have suggests that these jobs  will  expand dramatically under  the  new treaty, the new agreement.  Let me quickly say that as in any thing this is complex. It is not perfect,  and  it is not without  imperfections.  There are sectors of our economy that  feel less comfortable about the agree ment.  Our offices have expended numerous  resources to try to assure that the ef forts  in  the agreement  to keep  the  trade playing field level are secure.  In the case of peanuts, a very large  commodity,  the  largest  amount  of  which are produced  in  the State of  Georgia, we have been very concerned  about  point  of origin. That means  there is a concern that peanuts would  come from outside the jurisdiction of  the agreement and come through Mex ico into our country.  We have secured, through the efforts  of many Members of the Senate, com forting language, language that secures  the point of origin provisions  in  the  agreement.  We have secured language that cer tifies that imported peanuts must meet  the same standards that our producers  must meet in order to put quality prod ucts in the marketplace.  So, while we are encouraged by the  enormous benefits  that accrue  to 92  percent of our economy, we do not dis regard the concerns for the remaining  sectors of the economy and great ef forts have been taken and will continue  to be taken to assure that those sectors  of our economy are treated fairly under  this agreement.  Mr. President, the last point that I  will make and then yield back to the  senior Senator from Georgia  is  this:  This is no time for the United States to  run  from  the  future. This  is a  time  when we should speak to the pride of  this Nation. To quote a very famous  Democrat, President Franklin D. Roo sevelt, ""The only thing we have to fear  is fear itself.''  The  opponents  of  this  agreement  have espoused fear. There is no reason  ",1993

362,Senate,103,-0.382,97,20,Mr. LAUTENBERG.," Mr. President, I  stand before you today to pay tribute  to Spc. Dominick M. Pilla, a Ranger  tragically killed  in  the  recent clash  with Somali forces when his helicopter  was shot down by a  rocket-propelled  grenade.  Dominick Pilla, a New Jersey native,  was a recent graduate of Vineland High  School, Vineland, NJ. While still a stu dent he enlisted in the Army, following  the  family  tradition. Dominick's fa ther, Ben, served in Vietnam, while his  older brother, Frank, is a Navy veteran  of  the Persian Gulf war. Dominick,  however, knew from the beginning that  he wanted to try for the elite Ranger  unit  trained  for  fast, highly violent  confrontations.  Specialist Pilla had honorably served  3 years of a 4-year enlistment. He was  sent  to Somalia  this past August as  part of a mission of mercy. As a ma chine gunner, Pilla's duty was to guard  the door of the Blackhawk helicopter  in which he was killed.  Like his  fellow  soldiers, Specialist  Pilla died a hero. The United States is  indebted to him for his service. He will  be remembered not only for his dedica tion  to his nation, but also  for his  strength of character and his  love of  family and friends. His passing leaves a  void in the lives of many.

363,Senate,103,0.391,123,20,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President,  I  rise in support of the Health Care Anti trust Improvements Act of 1993, which  I am cosponsoring with Senator HATCH.  This  bill  addresses  antitrust  issues  which are crucial in our efforts to im prove America's health care system.  Health care reform is very likely to  be a key issue under consideration by  the Congress during the next session.  In order to reduce costs and eradicate  waste, various health care reform pro posals seek increased collaboration and  integration by medical providers into  larger, more efficient groups. Since the  antitrust laws require unfettered com petition, not collaboration,  it is not  surprising  that health  care  reform  raises significant antitrust issues. The  antitrust laws should continue to pro tect competition, but must be able to  accommodate  evolving  health  care  markets in order to promote high qual ity, affordable health care.  In order to permit more efficient ac tivities  and  organization  by  health  care providers,  the legislation we are  introducing  today provides  safe har bors for certain categories of conduct  which should not be  subject  to  the  antitrust laws. In addition, because of  the difficulty in determining where to  draw  the  lines  in changing markets,  the Attorney General  is  given  the  tasks of developing guidelines and ad ditional safe harbors for desirable con duct by providers, as well as reviewing  and issuing certificates to providers to  cover specific situations. Finally, our  legislation reduces antitrust penalties  for health care providers upon notifica tion of their joint activities to the At torney General, following  the pattern  of  the production  joint venture bill  that  passed  the Congress  and was  signed into law this year.  Mr. President, this legislation begins  the process of establishing a  frame work for adjusting the antitrust laws  to changing health care markets,  to  achieve the ultimate goal of more effi cient, higher quality medical services  at reasonable prices for the benefit of  all Americans.

364,House,103,-0.225,175,20,Mrs. SCHROEDER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman for yielding this  time to me, and I  thank him for his  very eloquent statement, because he  put it right down where it is.  Listen,  this  is not about putting a  foot in the door. This is about restor ing your rights. You can have your  rights if you take responsibility. Some how we have lost that in the eighties,  and this is very important to get us  back on track.  D 1010  What are your rights to a gun.  You don't have  rights  to a gun  if  you're convicted, and that is what this  is about,  if you are convicted of a  crime.  Now we do not let them vote if they  are convicted of a crime, but we are  going to let people have guns? For cry ing out loud, explain that to me.  This is long overdue, and I am very,  very pleased  this  is  coming  to  the  floor, and I want  to  thank  the gen tleman from New York [Mr. SCHUMER]  and many others who have worked so  hard to get it here.  I must say  the biggest oversight I  saw was the part where we did not get  domestic violence  included in here.  I  think people who have been convicted  of domestic violence should also be in  this, and I also think people who are  under  restraining  orders  should  be  under this because so many of the gun  felonies are against people who are in  the same family.  However, Mr. Speaker,  I  am very  pleased that the Committee on the Ju diciary is going to move on  the Vio lence Against Women Act, and we can  deal with  it  there, because we have  been winking at domestic violence for  a very long time in this country, and it  is time the Federal Government says,  and says strongly, ""We want the States  to take this much more seriously, we  want this beefed up, and we really want  these moved up to a felony level across  the  board  so  they will  be  in  this  thing."" I  think that is going to start  happening, and I am pleased that we  are going to try and do that before we  adjourn  because it  really has been  much too long in doing it.  It has been much too long in moving  the Brady bill, so I encourage people  today to vote for this rule and vote for  this bill and finally say that we are  coming to our senses in this country.  We  require people to have certain re sponsible  acts  to  do  anything  else,  drive a car, go to school, do all sorts of  things. But here, oh, no, anyone, any  age,  anywhere, whether or not  they  have been convicted of a felony, can go  out and do that. That is wrong. We are  going to correct it today, and I encour age an aye vote and a move  to final  passage as rapidly as possible.  ",1993
365,House,103,-0.196,175,20,Mr. VOLKMER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  re main opposed  to a  federally  imposed  waiting period prior to  the sale of a  handgun. There is no evidence that a  waiting period of any length, including  a 5...:business day wait as contained in  the interim provision of H.R. 1025, pre vents violent crime. As a matter of fact  waiting periods of any length have not  (Mr.  been  effective. Two-thirds of Ameri cans  are  already  Ii ving under  some  type of waiting period. Twenty of 22  States, as well as the District of Co lumbia, with waiting and/or permit to  purchase laws experienced increases in  violent crime rates from 1987  to 1991.  Most States that have  imposed some  type of waiting period on firearms pur chases have experienced  increases  in  violent crime or homicide rates greater  than the national trend. The 5-business  day waiting period as required in H.R.  1025  imposes a burden on  those who  obey the law, with no benefit in terms  of crime control.  If we are going  to  reduce violent  crime  in  this country, we must first  keep young people from  turning into  violent criminals, and second, we must  do something about the violent crimi nals that regretfully we already have.  In the first,  the Judiciary Commit tee, under the chairmanship of Chair man BROOKS, has taken action. Several  bills  that provide grants  for States  that will help  them  try  to dissuade  young people  from becoming violent  criminals were reported from the com mittee. The  full house  then debated  and passed the majority of these meas ures with my support. On  the second  point, what are we doing? Debating the  so-called Brady bill. I wish I could con vince my colleagues who want  to  in fringe on the rights of law abiding citi zens to own and use firearms that the  answers to solving the crime pro bl ems  in America has nothing whatsoever to  do with gun control. Getting criminals  off the street is the only way to solve  the crime problems.  I believe the leading immediate cause  of violent crime is the revolving door  of violent  criminals  in our prisons  where convicted criminals get a  sub stantial portion off of their sentences  from prison, and then are allowed back  out on  the street, and we all know  what happens then. It is ludicrous to  think that tougher gun laws will stop  criminals  from using guns  in crime.  They  don't obtain  them  legally  to  begin with and they won't stop obtain ing them no matter what law is passed.  Another disturbing provision in H.R.  1025, from a civil liberties perspective,  is the granting of absolute immunity  from damages  to Federal, State, and  local government officials,  including  law enforcement, even if the rights of a  law-abiding citizen have been violated  in  an  arbitrary manner.  The  pro ponents of a waiting period have long  suggested that the purpose of such a  wait  is  to  allow  time  to  scrutinize  handgun purchasers as a means of stop ping only criminals from making pur chases through retail outlets. However,  H.R. 1025 gives government at all levels  virtually unchecked veto power over  handgun sales, with no threat of pen alty for even bad faith abuse of that  power. Regardless of the reason for the  denial  individuals  unlawfully  denied  ",1993
366,House,103,0.446,188,20,Mr. THOMAS of Wyoming.," Madam  Chairman, I rise today to voice my op position  to  the Brady  bill.  I  have  thought a great deal about this ques tion, as  I  suspect most of us have.  Some answers come fairly simply and  fairly easily, and some do not. This one  is not an easy one.  All of us are opposed  to crime and  crimes committed by people with guns.  On the other hand, all of us are opposed  to placing unneeded restrictions on the  liberties of law-abiding citizens.  We  certainly  read every day  that  America is under siege and the Con gress has a  chance  to do  something  about it, and we are all interested in  that. I say ""something"" is the opera tive word, and I suspect that is what  this  is,  a  chance  to do  something.  Whether or not it is effective is really  the question, and is it a solution?  I have concluded that whether it is 5  days or 5 months, it probably does not  make much difference. Criminals will  still have access to weaponry that they  need.  They will  purchase  it  from  friends,  they will get it illicitly, and  certainly all we will do is put an obsta cle in place for people who buy guns for  legitimate purposes and cause crimi nals to get them in a way that is ille gitimate.  One size does not fit all, and that is  an  issue  that we have here.  I  come  from Wyoming, quite a different situ ation than New York City. And I think  to  try to attempt to have a blanket  system that works for everyone simply  is beyond the realm of possibility.  So Madam Chairman, I rise in opposi tion to this bill which I  think simply  diverts attention from  the real prob lem, and that is the problem of doing  something with criminals.  ",1993

368,House,103,-0.078,188,20,Mr. SARPALIUS.," Madam Chairman,  this amendment has bothered me,  the  'Brady bill, for quite some time because  I feel very strongly that it goes against  the very belief of the second amend ment. And  I contacted  the Archives,  and I asked for some research work on  the debate that was said at that time  when Samuel Adams made the motion  for that particular amendment.  During that debate it was made clear  that  every American  citizen  should  have the right to own and bear their  own arms, to protect themselves.  Now we can pass tough gun control  laws. Look  at which  city has  the  toughest gun control laws in the coun try. It is this one, Washington, DC. But  what city has more murders than any  other city? It is this one, Washington,  DC.  If we are going  to pass  tough gun  control  laws  to prevent people  from  killing people, why do we not look at  passing laws to outlaw knives, or ham mers or other weapons?  I think it is important that all of us  as American citizens and as Members  of this body should do everything we  can  to  help  protect  that  precious  amendment that our forefathers gave  us in the right of protecting ourselves.

372,House,103,-0.494,188,20,Mr. COYNE.,"  I  thank  the chairman  for yielding this time to me.  Madam Chairman, I strongly support  House passage of H.R. 1025,  the Brady  Handgun Violence Prevention Act.  The American people have a right to  demand that Congress take action to  prevent handgun violence in the streets  of our Nation. They know that since  the Brady bill was first  introduced 6  years ago over 150,000 Americans have  been killed by handguns. They know  that there is something wrong when a  convicted murderer can too easily pur chase a handgun in violation of exist ing Federal law. They know that the  Brady bill may not be the complete an swer to preventing handgun violence,  but Americans have expressed by over whelming majorities their belief that  the Brady bill can help.  There  is nothing complicated about  the Brady bill.  This bill provides  law enforcement  officials a 5-day waiting period to re view  handgun  purchase  applications  and screen out convicted  felons and  other  individuals who  are not  per mitted by law to purchase a handgun.  If law enforcement officials do not no tify a gun dealer that a sale would vio late Federal, State or local law,  then  that sale would proceed 5 business days  after the date of the purchase applica tion.  The Brady bill  is  just that simple.  This bill applies at the Federal level  the lessons learned in over 22 States,  including Pennsylvania, which  show  ",1993
373,House,103,0.51,201,20,Mr. MANZULLO.," Mr. Chairman,  today we  should be addressing the issue of crime. More  cops, more prisons,  less parole, and tougher  sentences  for criminals using guns, as op posed to  further gun control, are the keys to  reducing crime.  I voted against the Brady bill because wait ing periods for guns do not keep guns out of  the hands of criminals. The Bureau of Justice  statistics shows that  the vast majority of the  violent crimes committed in which a handgun  is  used  involve  illegal  possession  of  that  weapon, including black-market and theft.  The State of Illinois has much more restric tive gun laws than Brady. In addition, Wiscon sin, Iowa, and  Indiana all have some form of  a waiting period. It is already illegal for a resi dent of one State to purchase a handgun  in  another State. Thus, Brady will not keep guns  out of the hands of criminals, and that is why  I voted against  it. Even Sarah Brady herself  stated that ""it's *  * not a panacea.  It's not  going to stop crimes of passion or drug-related  crimes.""  Therefore, the issue is not guns, but crimi nals, and therefore  I supported the  following  measures:  First, because it is already a Federal crime  for a felon  to own a firearm,  I support a bill  that provides for States to put a magnetic strip  on  the back of all drivers' licenses-or other  State 1.0.-encoded to read whether someone  is a felon or adjudicated by a court to own or  possess a firearm. This would not be that dif ficult to implement. But, this alone will not stop  crime.  Second,  the House voted unanimously  to  put 50,000 more cops on  the beat  through  Federal grants  to States and  local commu nities. The Senate version of  the bill makes  the figure 100,000, and  I'll support that. The  presence of cops on the street is a proven de terrent to crime.  Third,  the Republican crime proposal pro vides  for Federal grants  to States  to build  combined Federal and State regional prisons,  provided States make criminals serve at least  *  85 percent of their sentence. When California  increased its prison capacity, crimes fell by 21  percent.  Fourth, I cosponsored a bill that put behind  bars for life any person convicted of three vio lent felonies, and the Senate just passed an other version of that 98 to 1.  Fifth,  the House voted overwhelmingly  for  funds for addressing drug trafficking, gang-re lated activity and providing drug abuse coun seling. The Chemical Dependency Services  Network in Illinois demonstrates that alcohol or  drugs are involved in three out of four crimes.  The  Illinois program known as Treatment Al ternatives for Special Clients states that sub stance abuse treatment reduces criminal activ ity. This is why I voted in favor of these pro grams, although  it  is  important  to keep our  focus on  the fact that criminals should serve  out their sentences.  In addition,  the Republican crime proposal  provides for nondeficit funding of these tough  criminal measures, through a reduction in ad ministration expenses of running  the Federal  Government.  Still yet, the most basic and primary focus of  any successful crime  initiative-one  that will  really deter crime-is prosecuting and locking  up the criminals. Mr. Speaker, this alone will  have the greatest effect of reducing the crime  rate than will the Brady bill.  ",1993
374,House,103,-0.153,201,20,Mr. HUGHES.," Mr. Chairman,  today  the  House has an opportunity  to vote on a bill  which I believe will make a major contribution  to our country's fight against gun-related vio lence and crime.  H.R. 1025, better known as the Brady bill,  would establish a mandatory, 5-day waiting  period for the purchase of handguns from  li censed dealers. The need for this legislation is  clear.  According to the Bureau of Justice statistics,  handguns are  involved  in an average 9,200  murders, 407 ,000 assaults, 210,000 robberies,  and 12,000 rapes every year.  Indeed, nearly  half  the murder victims  in our country are  killed with a handgun, while thousands more  use handguns to commit suicide.  These are not just numbers. There are real  people and  real  tragedies behind each and  every one of these statistics.  Some years ago, when I had the privilege of  chairing  the Subcommittee  on Crime, we  heard  from Jim Brady and others, who elo quently and bravely related just what it means  to be a victim of a handgun attack.  Indeed, it was the courage of Jim Brady, his  wife Sarah and others in coming forward to tell  their stories that helped to focus public atten tion on the senseless tragedy of handgun-re lated violence. Through their efforts, we have  reached the point today where there is over whelming support among the American people  for a handgun waiting period.  Let me take just a few moments to highlight  some of the key provisions of this bill.  Essentially, the bill creates a Federal 5-day  waiting period before a licensed dealer may  transfer a handgun to a private purchaser.  Each prospective handgun purchaser will be  required to give the dealer a sworn statement  containing some personal  identification  infor mation,  including a statement  that  the pur chaser  is not precluded under Federal  law  from owning a handgun. The dealer  is  reimportant  quired to transmit this information to the chief  local  law enforcement officer within 1 day of  the proposed transfer.  Unless law enforcement finds the purchaser  is  ineligible to buy a handgun,  the sale may  proceed 5 business days after the statement  is  first signed. The sale may proceed even  quicker  if  the  local  law enforcement notifies  the dealer that there  is no problem with  the  purchaser's eligibility. It's that simple.  In other words, the police are given a rea sonable opportunity to conduct a background  check, but  they cannot  indefinitely delay  the  sale by stalling or failing to provide a notice of  authorization to the dealer. The onus rests en tirely with the law enforcement officer, not the  dealer or the prospective purchaser.  The Brady bill has several other  features as well.  To help protect  the privacy of  legal pur chasers,  it requires that a copy of the state ment and other records of the transaction be  destroyed within 20 days.  It also authorizes $100 million  in grants to  States to help automate their criminal record keeping systems, and  terminates  the waiting  period  requirement as  soon  as  an  instant  criminal  identification system becomes oper ational nationwide.  Mr. Chairman,  there are some who argue  that a waiting period doesn't work. They are  wrong.  I would urge those who doubt the ef fectiveness of the waiting period to look at our  experience  in New Jersey, where applicants  are required to undergo a rigorous background  check every  time  they apply  for a permit  to  purchase a firearm.  Over  the  last  two  decades, more  than  19,000 people who applied  for a permit  in  New Jersey have been turned down, because  the background check showed  they had a  criminal or mental history,  they  lied on  their  application  form, or they were otherwise dis qualified from purchasing a gun.  Unfortunately, New Jersey's waiting period  law has been undercut by the fact that other  nearby States do not have similar  require ments. For instance, anyone can walk into a  gun shop in Virginia, show a false  identifica tion card,  lie on the application form and pur chase a gun on the spot. All too often, these  guns are carried into New Jersey, where they  are used to commit crimes.  There are also those who argue that a wait ing period  is  too much of a burden on  law abiding citizens. Let me say  to  those critics  that we all endure waiting periods of one kind  or another in most aspects of our lives, wheth er it's to get a license to operate a business,  get a credit card, or for other purposes.  We fill out forms all the time including back ground information, ship them off and, if we're  lucky, within some reasonable period of time  we get the license or credit card or whatever  else it was we are seeking. This bill does not  create a record check which  is any different  than  the kind we all experience dozens of  times during our lives.  And if you really want to know what it's like  to be  inconvenienced,  I suggest you  talk to  Jim  and Sarah  Brady.  They  suffer  every  minute of their lives as a result of a senseless  act of violence which may well have been pre vented  if a waiting period had been  in effect  the day John Hir:ickley walked into a gun shop  ",1993
375,House,103,-0.08,214,20,Mr. BREWSTER.," Mr. Chairman,  I  rise today in support of the amendment  of  the gentleman  from Pennsylvania  [Mr. GEKAS]. The gentleman's amend ment would establish a time certain of  5 years for implementation of the na tional  instant-check system. History  shows that such a  timeframe  is emi nently workable. Virginia was the first  State in the Nation to adopt a system  of instant background checks. The leg islation was passed in March 1989 and  the system went online November 1,  1989, 10 months later. The time which  elapsed shows that it can certainly be  done. In very similar timeframes sys tems went online in the States of Dela ware, Wisconsin, and Illinois. Florida  passed an instant-check system in 1989  that took effect in early 1991.  History also shows the instant-check  system works. Virginia's State police  lieutenant, Jim Snow, a records man agement officer, was asked last June if  an extra 5 days would allow a more  thorough  check. His  answer  to  the  Washington Post was, ""No, not really.  We can check what needs to be checked  in 2 minutes or less.''  Today two-thirds of America's popu lation lives under a waiting period pro gram similar to Brady. Those States  also have the highest murder rates and  the highest crime rates in America.  The  instant-check  system makes  sense because it works. I think that it  is time that this Nation moves toward  checking violent criminals. But, make  no mistake, the only thing that deters  crime is punishment or fear of punish ment. Justice must be swift and sure.  Today's criminal  justice system  is  broken. In New York alone it takes 5  years for  the average felony  to go  to  trial.  I would encourage my colleagues to  support  the Gekas  amendment.  moves in the right direction to stop the  crime wave in this Nation.  ",1993
376,House,103,0.425,214,20,Mr. SMITH of Texas.," Mr. Chairman, I  thank the gentleman for yielding time  tome.  Mr. Chairman,  I  rise  in  support of  this  amendment. Some Members  feel  they can  vote  for  this  legislation because  the waiting  period is only temporary, before a national in stant-check system is established. But as the  saying goes, there is nothing more permanent  than a temporary government program.  Under  this bill,  the waiting period can be  postponed indefinitely if the Attorney General  decides to do so.  It took Virginia less than a year to bring its  instant-check system on  line. Shouldn't we  hold the implementation by other States to a  similar time frame? Thirty months is a reason able amount of time to give States to imple ment  the  instant  check  provisions.  Sixty  months, ;:ts Mr. GEKAS proposes in his amend ment, is more than enough time to bring this  national system on-line.  Do not be fooled. Opponents of this amend ment have only one wish-to drag out  the  waiting period indefinitely.  H.R. 1025 contains more loopholes than a  bandolier. For any number of reasons, the At torney General can postpone the certification  of  the national  instant-check system-mean while  infringing upon  the constitutional  rights  of law-abiding citizens.  The only  real answer  to gun violence  is  swift, severe, and guaranteed punishment for  people who misuse guns. That  is what we  should be considering here today.  Instead, we are  likely  to help  the criminal  more than we are the victim with  this bill by  placing restrictions on the self defense of law abiding citizens.  I urge my colleagues to support the Gekas  amendment and provide a sunset provision to  the 5-day waiting period.  ",1993

378,House,103,0.627,266,20,Mr. ROHRABACHER.," . Let  us note  that in the Cato Institute, as you say,  which  is a  libertarian  think  tank,  if  there was  any possibility  that you  would have government authority of  another government on  the people of  the United States, they would be  the  first ones to squawk. They would be  the  first ones  to highlight  that, be cause  they do not even  like govern ment authority of their own govern ment over them. And the fact is that if  I, and I am sure this is true of the three  of us, I am sure it is true of everyone  in this Hall who supports NAFTA, if we  did not think this was the best deal for  the United States of America, we, sure,  we think that as neighbors our welfare  is tied to Mexico, a growing prosperous  Mexico, but we are not for this treaty  simply because it is going to help Mex ico. If this was not the best deal for the  United States,  the best deal  for  the  people of our own areas even, we would  not be supporting it.  And the fact is that taking away the  right of our people or even diminishing  the right of our people to control their  own destinies, by one iota, would never  make up for a multitude of enrichment  in terms of the material side.  0  2000  We as Americans, the love of liberty  is what ties us together. It is not just  the struggle  to obtain material well being. It is  the  love of freedom  that  brought  people  here  to  the United  States of America, and the right for us  to control our own destinies.  The fact is that this treaty, by pro viding economic well being for the peo ple of Mexico, will also provide  jobs  and an economic upsurge for people in  the United States. At the same time,  by having a more prosperous country,  we make our country a freer country.  I  worked with  Pat Buchanan.  I  worked at  the White House.  I heard  him last night on ""Night Line."" He was  asked for specifics of what he thought  was in some way a  threat to national  sovereignty. I am afraid to say that he  acted exactly  like Ross Perot acted  earlier with AL GORE. He tried to ease  around the subject. He never gave spe cifics.  I am a patriot. I worked for Ronald  Reagan. I worked in the Reagan White  House with  Pat Buchanan. Ronald  Reagan would never concede anything  of  American  sovereignty.  Ronald  Reagan  is solidly behind  this agree ment. I am solidly behind this agree ment. Conservatives who  are  excep tionally  patriotic  are  behind  this  agreement.    I  think, again,  this  is  just another  example of fear-mongering, of trying to  basically play  to  people's fears  and  anxieties,  rather  than  giving  them  something of substance.  ",1993
379,,103,0.256,682,20,Ms. MOLINARI.," Mr. Speaker, on July 1,  1993 I introduced legislation with Representa tives MARKEY, MORELLA, and ESHOO  that will  effectively ban billboard advertising  in space.  On April 12 of this year, Space Marketing Inc.  of Roswell, GA, announced its plans to place  1-mile-long advertisements in the Earth's orbit,  towed by satellites.  These space billboards would be visible to  the naked eye on earth, as large and at least  as bright as a full Moon, and engineered to be  more visible at sunrise and sunset. These bill boards can even be positioned to appear to  target audiences at peak times of the day and  evening.  What should we say to the parents of this  Nation when they have to explain to their chil dren why  the hemorrhoid ointment advertise ment  is next to  the Moon or the Sun?  It  is  alarming enough that advertising has become  a virtual omnipresent facet of our daily lives.  Are we going  to  remain  idle and permit our  children to grow-up believing that an orbiting  billboard  is part of nature,  just  like  the Sun  and Moon?  There will be no more  romantic moonlit  strolls or breathtaking sunrises. No more prac ticing the ancient art of naked eye astronomic  study. And no  longer could we  look  to  the  heavens  for  unadulterated  inspiration  and  comfort.  Billboards  in space  is a clear violation on  our environment. Unlike  television programs  and Earth advertisements, we would not be  able to turn these stellar pervaders off.  We can only dream of the new heights that  society will reach in terms of technological ad vancements. Billboards  in  space  however,  amount to nothing more than a nightmare.  WELFARE REFORM  HON.

383,House,103,0.364,708,20,Mr. TALENT.," Mr. Speaker, I  thank  the gentleman  for yielding me  this  time.  Mr.  Speaker,  during  the  difficult  days of July and August when the flood  was hitting in the Midwest one of the  things people in my district constantly  asked me was: ""Look, the attention of  the Nation is on us now during the dif ficult times when we are fighting these  waters. What are people going  to do  when the waters have gone down? Are  they going  to  leave us alone, or are  they going to be there to help?""  I  think  the significant  thing about  this bill is that it sends a signal that  the Government is still aware of the  problem and is still going to be there  to help, and I think there are two sig nificant things about it that we are ad dressing in this legislation. The first is  the whole question of people who have  been put out of  their homes, whose  homes have been very  substantially  damaged and who face now the issue of  whether to try and rebuild according to  Federal and local regulations or wheth er to try to seek a buy-out and to relo cate.  Those  individuals, as much as  they  need  anything  else,  need  some  cer tainty about the options that are going  to be available.  As has been said here today, very few  people are going to be made completely  whole, but  they need  to know how  much they can count on, what kind of  support is going  to be available, and  whether there will be help in relocat ing. And if they are going to have to  make  the  difficult  decisions  about  whether they should stay or whether  they should move, I believe this legis lation sends a signal that the Federal  Government is moving as quickly as  possible to try to identify those areas  of uncertainty and eliminating them.  The committee deserves a great deal of  credit in putting it out in an expedi tious way.  The other really important aspect of  the bill-and there is a number of good  features  in  it-is the comprehensive  study that it mandates, with particular  emphasis on the upper Mississippi and  the upper Missouri tributaries so that  we can begin looking at what we can do  in a  broad  fashion  to prevent  these  kinds of floods in the future or, failing  that, to try to protect the people in the  area from the damage that would oth erwise occur.

384,House,103,-0.294,734,20,Mr. KREIDLER.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  voice my strong support  for H.R. 2884,  the  School To Work Opportunities Act of 1993.  This program is long overdue. It will help meet  the needs of noncollege bound high school  students for career education.  About half of America's young people do not  go on to college; 75 percent do not achieve a  college degree. Our  rapidly changing work  force  requires  the  improvement of our stu dents' basic skills to compete in a global econ omy. They should have access to both aca demic and vocational education in accordance  with their interests, needs, and abilities.  In my State of Washington,  the school-to work concept has already been successfully  linking high school students with career oppor tunities. Students in the Bethel School District  are using ""Career Paths"" that emphasize inte gration of academic and vocational education.  These students are able to gain valuable work  experience while going to school. Beginning in  the eighth grade, students are encouraged to  explore their career interests and start taking  classes that relate to  those  fields. The  local  community is involved as well, by allowing stu dents into the workplace to experience hands on learning.  I was proud to cast my vote in favor of the  School To Work Opportunities Act.  It is time  that we respond to the changing needs of our  global economy by  improving our education  system as well as our work force, and by pro viding our students the skills and opportunities  they need to compete.

386,House,103,-0.455,773,20,Mr. FARR.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup port of  the  conference agreement  to H.R.  2401, the fiscal year 1994 DOD Authorization  Act, and to commend the distinguished chair man of the House Armed Services Committee,  Mr. DELLUMS for his hard work, and outstand ing stewardship of the committee  in his  first  conference  as  chairman.  This  conference  agreement we are about to vote on is an ex cellent example of the direction that our Nation  needs to take in the post-cold-war era. While  authorizing $2.6 billion less than the adminis tration's fiscal year 1994 request, and $12 bil lion less than fiscal year 1993 appropriations,  the conference agreement continues to allow  for sound investment in our post-cold-war mili tary needs.  I want to take this opportunity to call your  attention  to an extremely  important provision  of the bill which would allow for the transfer of  surplus real property at military bases to  the  local communities  for  the purposes of eco nomic development.  I commend  the Depart ment of Defense for its efforts to work out a  suitable agreement  for  transferring  the  re quested parcels of land at Fort Ord, CA, be tween all parties, and I thank the distinguished  chairman of my committee  for his guidance  and assistance in this process, as well as for  his strong  support  for seeing  this  initiative  through, as  illustrated  in our earlier colloquy.  The  conference  agreement  before  us will  make possible the transfer of certain parcels  of property at Fort Ord, CA,  to the California  State University  [CSU] and  the University of  California [UC], for the purposes of developing  a 4-year campus at the Fort Ord site, with a  focus  on  the marine  and  environmental  sciences,  in conjunction with a science,  re search, policy and development center, focus ing on  the development of environmental re mediation technology for use in the cleanup of  former military bases. This provision  in  the  conference agreement will make it possible to  lay the foundation for the development of the  Monterey Bay region as a world center for ma rine  and  environmental  science  and  tech nology. While highlighting the marine environ ment of California's central coast, including the  newly established Monterey Bay National Ma rine Sanctuary, this provides unparalleled op portunities  to  use our  region's natural  re sources including the sanctuary, as a marine  laboratory. In addition to providing viable eco nomic growth opportunities  for  the  impacted  Fort Ord region, this project is evolving into a  model  success  of  defense  base  reuse,  through  a  joint  education/research  venture  which will provide for the development of pul:r  lie/private partnerships and alliances, through  facilitating collaborative research opportunities  and providing a.n  interface between science,  technology and policy, a most worthwhile en deavor.

387,House,103,-0.211,812,20,Mr. POSHARD.," Mr. Speaker, as a  Member of Congress who has studied  this  issue nearly 2 years, having at tended literally hundreds of meetings  and engaged my staff in much research,  I  concluded some  time ago  that  the  NAFTA was wrong  for our country.  And  I  know  that honorable  people  looking at the same set of facts can  disagree. Many of the folks that just  spoke to us here are some of my best  friends  in  this Congress, and  I have  honest disagreement with them in re gard to this particular issue.  I have held 12 public  forums of 3  hours each in every part of my district  over the past month to discuss and de bate this agreement. I want to restate  the major arguments for this NAFTA,  many of which have  just been made,  and explain why I disagree with those  arguments.  The first argument for NAFTA from  those who favor this agreement is that  this is a  free-trade agreement and it  will create  thousands of jobs in  this  country by ending tariffs and creating  more exports  to Mexico  to satisfy a  growing Mexican market.  Well, true free-trade means that an  industry competes for market share by  building a better product than its com petitor. When American firms compete  in Europe or here at home, they have  to win market share by wise manage ment and by being more creative or  more  resourceful because our econo mies are nearly equal. There is no in herent  advantages with  respect  to  wages or benefits, or energy costs, or  supplies and so on. True free trade does  not win over our competitors by build ing a product at one-tenth the wages  others must pay. But under NAFTA, a  company can beat  its competitor  in  this country by simply moving to Mex ico and taking advantage of low wages  and nonenforcement  of environment  laws of that country.  The Mexican Government, which con trols every variable of  the Mexican  economy, including wages and prices,  purposely holds down wages and  re fuses to enforce environmental laws to  entice United States manufacturers to  Mexico.  D 2300  I have here a copy of the article in  the Business Week magazine of April  19, 1993, entitled ""The Mexican Work er."" It is describing the skill and the  conditions of the Mexican worker  in  Mexico. It says, and I am reading in  the Business Week article,  As Arriega and millions of other Mexican  workers pursue their careers, few realize how  closely their progress is monitored and con trolled  by  government  officials.  Every  Thursday morning for  the past 6 years, a  cadre of economists,  including six cabinet  members and top business leaders and union  officials, has gathered around a  large table  in  the Labor Secretariat offices in Mexico  City. There they thrash out agreements that  control prices and wages and brainstorm on  ways to boost productivity. It is the kind of  social pact that has been tried in many other  Latin American countries, but only in Mex ico with its one-party rule have such agree ments  stuck. Mandated by  the country's  leading economist, President Carlos Salinas,  the goal is to lift the productivity of Arriega  and his fellow workers to first-world levels.  In their drive to modernize Mexico, Salinas  and his planners command nearly every vari able of the economy. To smother inflation  and to preserve Mexico's huge labor-cost gap  with the U.S. and other producers, Salinas  fixes salaries  through a  complex business labor agreement that is known as 'El Pacto.'  He annoints and boots out labor union bosses  and  state governors alike. Salinas'  tech nocrats  juggle  import duties and steer in vestment from one region to another.  Total, absolute government control  of all wages and prices, the very thing  that the supporters of this NAFTA in  this Congress would never agree to the  American Government engaging in.  The Mexican worker has a minimum  wage of 57 cents per hour and an aver age wage in the high-technology Unit ed States plants in Mexico of $1.27 per  hour with 34 cents per hour in benefits.  Their wages were cut  in half when  President Salinas  took office  in  the  1980's.  To this point in time, 5 years later,  they have gained back only 13.5 percent  of the 50 percent of the wages they lost  while the productivity rate in Mexico  has grown at 24.5 percent over  that  same  5-year  period,  a  phenomenal  growth.  The folks who just spoke here talked  about a rising middle class in Mexico.  How can there be a rising middle class  when the minimum wage is 57 cents an  hour? The workers in the United States  factories  there  are making $1.61  an  hour, and 90 percent of the Mexican la borers make less than $22 per day.  Their system allows United States  manufacturers to build or move plants  to Mexico which would otherwise be lo cated in this country,_ costing us thou sands of  jobs  in  the process. Those  same plants in Mexico ship their prod ucts back to this country and undercut  American manufacturers who cannot  compete with the low wage base and  lax environmental enforcement in Mex ico, again costing us additional thou sands of jobs.  I have here a  list of communities  that I have represented over the past 5  years that have lost jobs to these cheap  exports:  Brown  Shoe  Co.  in  Murphysboro, IL, estimated employees,  500 people; Joe Mack Glove Co., 125 em ployees; Intuitions in Carbondale, 360  employees;  Cal Crest Outerwear  in  Murphysboro,  200  employees;  Inter national  Shoe  in  Chester,  IL,  Florsheim Shoes  in Anna,  IL, Good  Luck Gloves in Metropolis, IL; Forest  City Co., which has had plants  in  DuQuoin and Pinckneyville and many  others, over 1,500 employees in the tex tile  industries alone  that have  lost  their jobs to these cheap imports flood ing back into this country.  In  1992  the great majority of all  American exports to Mexico were cap ital goods, that is, materials and ma chinery  for  building  and  operating  American industrial plants in Mexico,  and intermediate goods, raw materials,  supplies and components for manufac turing, assembling, and exporting back  to the United States.

Francis Gary Powers and his historic  flight into the Soviet Union with a commemo rative stamp.  Captain Powers served as a U.S. U-2 pilot  during the cold war. On May 1 , 1960, Captain  Powers' plane was shot down while perform ing  a  reconnaissance  mission  over  the  U.S.S.R. After ejecting himself from his plane,  Captain Powers was taken into custody by the  Russians and subjected to hours of interroga tion. Captain Powers followed his CIA regula tions and only revealed to the Russians what  they already knew or assumed about his mis sion and his plane. At no point did Captain  Powers reveal classified  information, and he  even misled the Russians about some impor tant features of his top secret airplane.  Unfortunately, while Captain Powers was  honorably serving his country over in Russia,  rumors spread  in America  that he had be trayed  the United States, and had  revealed  privileged information to the Soviets. These ru mors were not true. Meanwhile, Captain Pow ers was tried  for espionage by the Russians,  convicted on  this charge, and  imprisoned for  21 months. When he  finally  returned  to  the  United States, Captain Powers sought to clear  his name, but was never fully exonerated by  the CIA. He  lived his  life knowing  that there  were people who would always believe that he  November 15, 1993  had betrayed his country. It was not until after  his  death  that  Francis Gary Powers was  awarded  the Distinguished Flying Cross and  promoted to the rank of captain.  Captain Powers served his country, as he  was trained to do, and he did it with honor, in tegrity, and bravery. Today, I have introduced  legislation which will do the right and just thing  and repair Capt. Francis Gray Powers' name  and reputation  forever by honoring both him self and his historic  flight over  the Soviet  Union on a commemorative stamp. I ask that  you  join me  in honoring Captain Powers by  becoming a cosponsor of this important legis lation.  H.R.  3490, COOPERATIVE AGRICUL TURAL  PROGRAMS  EXTENDED  RETIREMENT  CREDIT  ACT  OF  1993  HON. E de la GARZA  OF TEXAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, November 15, 1993  Mr. DE LA GARZA. Mr. Speaker,  I want to  bring to my colleagues' attention the bill H.R.  3490,  the Cooperative Agricultural Programs  Extended  Retirement Credit  Act  of  1993  [CAPERCA], which I recently introduced.  This legislation has two objectives. First,  it  would facilitate the downsizing of the U.S. De partment of Agriculture  [USDA] by providing  an added  incentive for certain current USDA  employees to take early retirement through the  proposed buy-out option. The Clinton adminis tration has proposed reducing the number of  full-time equivalent employees at USDA by  7 ,500 people.  Second,  the bill would provide civil service  retirement credit for certain USDA employees  and  retirees who previously worked as State  employees or as employees of private agen cies designated  to carry out certain Federal  and Federally-funded programs. These USDA  employees or  retirees are currently not al lowed  to have  those years  in public service  calculated  toward  their annuity benefits. The  bill would allow these persons to receive credit  toward retirement benefits for the years they  performed a Federal function as a State or pri vate agency employee.

402,House,103,0.519,851,20,Mr. DOOLITTLE.," Mr. Speaker,  the  good news  is  that President Clinton  has finally started paying attention to  what his Justice Department is doing  to weaken  the Federal child pornog raphy law.  The bad news is that he is blaming  Congress  for  the problem, when  the  problem lies squarely within the Clin ton Justice Department. Rather than  admit that his Justice Department has  wrongly  interpreted congressional  in tent in  the case of Knox versus  the  United States, President Clinton wants  to rewrite the law.  This rewrite is a convenient way for  him to try to distance himself from his  Attorney General's mistaken position  on this issue.  Recently by a vote of 100  to 0,  the  other body voted against this interpre tation of the Justice Department.  Now it is the turn of the House to re affirm  congressional  intent  on  this  issue. Our message to President Clin ton is that the current law is sufficient  and we do not need to enact new legis lation.  I hope my colleagues will  join  the  gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. CHRIS  SMITH] and me in cosponsoring House  Resolution 281  to request Justice De partment  reversal of  its decision  to  weaken the Federal child pornography  law.

This truly is a  struggle for a better way of life for all  people, and we consider this issue du~­ ing a  time when our own domestic  economy has been sputtering and suf fering the loss of millions of manufac turing jobs.    AN OPPORTUNITY  Mr. Speaker,  in  this post-cold war  era, the United States confronts an his toric opportunity as  the preeminent  world economy and the world's largest  democratic republic and market. Our  new challenge  is  to use our  trading  power to promote democracy and raise  the standard of living for our own peo ple, as well as people around the world.  Our objective should be  to engage in  high wage/high productivity competi tion with other advanced economies,  not  to meet  the competition of  low  wage/high  productivity/nondemocratic  societies. And we must place equal em phasis on prying open the closed mar kets of the world. The trade agreement  that moves us  in to  this new era of  trade-linked  advancement  will  be  precedent setting.  NAFTA DOESN'T MEASURE UP  This NAFTA is not a fundamental re alignment of trade policy. It is a nar rowly  drawn  tariff  and  investment  agreement with toothless side addenda.  It is a  throwback  to post-1946 World  War II era, when America tried to re build  the world and  stave off com munism by absorbing imports into our  economy  from nations devastated by  war and corrupt political systems. This  program was wildly  successful,  and  Japan, Korea,  and Taiwan are  now  among our foremost competitors. But  the world has changed. Their econo mies remain export driven,  their pro duction  is still aimed at  the United  States market, but they have contin ued to protect their own markets from  United States exports. The result is a  persistent trade deficit, and an erosion  of our economic security. (Chart A trade balance). Ours is still the largest  national economy in the world, but it  is  threatened by a  flood of  imports  from low wage countries, and persist ent barriers to U.S. exports to other  major markets.  THE ECONOMIC REALITIES  With the end of the cold war and the  growth of the global economy, our se curity depends more than ever on eco nomic strength, and our most critical  challenges are in the marketplace. The  history of the 20th century in our coun try has been one of ""taming"" our na tional marketplace to make room for  social values. American workers fought  hard for labor rights; the bleak years of  the depression taught us important les sons about regulating the marketplace;  and more recently we have worked to  find effective ways to protect our envi ronment and the health and safety of  our citizens at home and at work. Can ada, Japan and the nations of Europe  have enacted many similar protections,  but we compete in global markets with  nations that do not have similar pro tections. They do not share our politi cal and social values, and they are will ing to accept conditions that we find  unacceptable.  The challenge of trade policy in this  unregulated global market  is  to use  our market power to respect our work ers and strengthen our economy. We  cannot  let  the greed of the market place overwhelm the values that under lie our democracy. As we adapt to re main competitive and increase produc tivity, we must make sure  that our  policy reflects our fundamental values  and contributes to a better standard of  living for our citizens.  Since the 1970's, the American econ omy has been eroded by gaping trade  deficits and devastating losses of high wage manufacturing jobs. Our full-time  high-wage job base continues to erode  while part-time work increases.  During the last decade, United States  manufacturing  employment  fell  by  951,000  jobs, while employment in the  maquiladora areas of northern Mexico  exploded by 431,000 jobs.  Last year, U.S. employment fell by  another 325,000 jobs.  Unemployment just ticked up again,  and more than 400,000 layoffs have been  announced since January 1.  General Motors will  trim  its U.S.  workforce by 74,000 and close 21 plants  over the next 4 years.  IBM has announced plans to cut its  labor  force  by  an  additional  35,000  workers.  Industry  restructuring may  insure  the long-term survival of the compa nies themselves, but we cannot ignore  the significance of the job losses. Laid off workers have not been able to find  ",1993
407,Senate,103,-0.395,1046,20,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr. President, on a num ber of occasions I have taken this floor  to explain my opposition  to NAFTA;  that there are many reasons to oppose  it, one of the many reasons being that  Mexico was allowed to continue, at a  slightly reduced level, discriminatory  restrictions on American autos and  auto parts for 10 years.  Now, if you are pro-NAFTA, you say,  ""Well, after 10 years, they are going to  get rid of their discriminatory restric tions on those products."" But I do not  think we ought to  tolerate  those re strictions for 10 more months, much  less for 10 more years. And that is one  of the many reasons why I stated my  opposition to NAFTA.  The same  thing  is true with many  other products  in other parts of the  country where under NAFTA, Mexico  is allowed to continue discriminatory  restrictions on our goods for 10 years.  But  today  I want  to  focus on  the  numbers game which the administra tion is playing about how many jobs  will be created by NAFTA. The admin istration claims over and over again  that NAFTA will create 200,000 new  U.S.  jobs by 1995. In fact, it is one of  the central selling points of NAFTA.  Way up in front of the literature that  is produced to sell NAFTA you will al most always  see  that  figure-200,000  new U.S. jobs will be created by 1995.  President Clinton  said,  ""I believe  NAFTA will create 200,000 Americans  jobs  in  the first 2 years."" Secretary  Bentsen said, ""We calculate that we'll  pick up 200,000 more jobs in the next 2  years alone."" Secretary Brown  said,  ""The  administration  forecasts  that  NAFTA  will  create  an  additional  200,000 high-wage jobs by 1995."" Ambas sador Kantor said, ""We estimate a gain  of 200,000  [jobs],  just  in  the  first 2  years.""  So the 200,000 jobs claim is a central  selling point of the administration.  We decided  to test that out in the  Governmental Affairs Committee. We  invited the administration to come. We  invited Ambassador Kantor, but he did  not make it. Instead, they sent up the  Acting Under Secretary of Commerce  for Economic Affairs, Paul London. We  held a hearing in the Governmental Af fairs Committee and asked Mr. London  to explain the basis for the 200,000 fig ure. He made some important revela tions as to exactly how the administra tion bases its claim that NAFTA will  result in 200,000 U.S. jobs by 1995.  Mr. President, I call the math that is  used by  the administration  to make  their  200,000  jobs  claim  ""NAFTA  math."" The principles of NAFTA math  would make most elementary school teachers wince. For instance, NAFTA  math only counts jobs claimed to be  created by  increased exports-that is  the 200,000 jobs-while totally ignoring  jobs that are displaced by increased im ports from Mexico.  Now here is the way President Clin ton and Secretary Bentsen came up  with  the 200,000-job  figure. President  Clinton says, ""Every time we sell $1  billion of American products and serv ices overseas, we create 20,000  jobs.""  Treasury Secretary Bentsen  then ar rives at the 200,000 new  jobs number  based on a hoped-for increase of $10 bil lion in United States exports to Mexico  by 1995.  According  to  the  administration's  math-or NAFTA math-since each bil lion  in exports  is claimed  to create  about 20,000 jobs, $10 billion in exports  equals about 200,000 jobs.  That claim is a gross distortion. It  looks at only half the story. If you use  the whole picture and look at both ex ports and imports,  jobs which will be  lost because of the job displacement ef fect of increased imports from Mexico  should  be  deducted  from  any  jobs  claimed to be created by increased ex ports.  But what the administration is doing  is  like  looking at half a  ledger-the  revenue side-while ignoring the other  half of the  ledger-the expenses-and  then claiming great profits.  In  last Wednesday's hearing, Com merce Under Secretary London admit ted that the 200,000-job gain number is  a gross number based solely on hoped for  increased exports  to Mexico. The  Commerce Department, he  acknowl edged, has not deducted jobs displaced  by  imports  from  the 200,000-job gain  claim that the administration is mak ing. When  I  asked how many  jobs  would be lost from increased imports  from Mexico, Mr. London  said  that  some would be lost but no attempt was  made to quantify that number.  So the administration has not even  done  the  calculation  regarding  how  many  jobs are lost from  imports, al though they admit that some jobs will  be lost. They do not even have a  for mula or a methodology to do the esti mate on  jobs lost from  imports. But  they have a very elaborate formula to  calculate jobs gained from exports.  What we confirmed at this hearing,  Mr. President,  is  that  every  single  United States  export  to Mexico  is  counted as a  job creator. By the way,  even those exports which are not job  creators in the normal sense, such as  parts and components, that now shift  to Mexico and that previously were as sembled in the United States.  In looking at the 1992 United States  trade  balance with Mexico-exports  and imports-the administration takes  the  export number-one-half of  the  ledger-and says that every single ex port is a  job creator. They totally ig nore the other half of the picture, the  imports. Not  one  single  import  is  counted by the administration as a job  loser-not one. The import half is ig nored. Every single dollar in the export  half is given a  job-creating number every dollar. Every dollar on the im port half is ignored. No losses or jobs  are subtracted from the gains. One-half  of the picture is presented to the Amer ican people in that 200,000 job claim of  the administration.  Mr. President, it is time for the ad ministration  to play  it straight and  stop  using  distortions  and NAFTA  math to sell this agreement. If the ad ministration is really as confident as it  appears  to  be  about  its  case  for  NAFTA, it should be willing to make  that case without resorting to creative  math.  Look at both sides of the picture, not  just half. If you are going to attribute  job gains  to exports-and obviously  many of them are  job creators-then  you have to look at the job losses that  some imports create and deduct the job  losses from the job gains when talking  about NAFTA-created jobs. Otherwise,  it is half the ledger, half the picture  and a distortion which gives a false im pression to the American people.  Mr. President,! yield the floor, and I  thank the Chair.

409,,103,-0.191,1163,20,Mr. FINGERHUT.," Mr. Speaker, the rhetoric  over NAFT A has  reached a  fever pitch  in  these  last few days, but  I am  frustrated that  the debate has degenerated  into such  ""he  said-she said"" arguments that no one has fo cused on what an  alternative  trade policy  might look like.  Let me clearly state-I oppose NAFT A and  will vote against it. Unlike others who argue  against the treaty, though, I believe this must  be  the beginning-not  the end-of our na tional debate regarding free trade and the fu ture of our businesses and workers.  Over the years, we have lost thousands of  manufacturing jobs to Southeast Asia, Mexico,  and other low-wage economies. NAFT A would  only make that trend worse. No matter what  the supporters say, we will  lose  jobs under  NAFT A-especially  the good manufacturing  jobs that are critical to the Greater Cleveland  economy.  But NAFTA's defeat will not make our trade  problems go away. We will continue  to  lose  jobs abroad until we design an aggressive ex port strategy and encourage our businesses to  stay home and  invest here. That is the posi tive alternative to NAFT A that has to be raised  now, in the final stages of the NAFTA debate,  and  that  is  the alternative we must put  into  place in the future.  The heart of any trade policy should be its  emphasis on  increasing our export of goods.  Increased  exports mean  economic  growth,  more jobs, higher wages and a better stand ard of living. But while the United States has  traditionally pursued this goal solely through a  strategy of low  tariffs, other major  industrial  countries  have  used  aggressive  export  promoton programs to penetrate our markets  and clearly defined  industrial policies to pro tect their own.  How can we be smarter and more aggres sive? Last November, I proposed the creation  of a Department of International Trade to co ordinate our efforts and offer one-stop Federal  assistance to export companies. Currently, 19  different agencies oversee 100 different trade  promotion programs, an alphabet of assist ance  that puzzles  the  shrewdest business  owner.  We must also reexamine what products we  support with our trade promotion dollar. Agri culture products, for example, amount to only  10 percent of our total exports, yet they get 7 4  percent of our trade promotion funding.  Government can lilso help boost exports by  getting out of the way when  it  is hurting pri vate trade efforts. Export controls leftover from  29519  the cold war,  for example, cost us an esti mated $1 O to $20 billion a year in  lost trade.  As a member of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee panel on  trade,  I am helping  to  craft an export promotion strategy that would  go a long way toward helping American busi nesses penetrate other markets. The plan we  are devising would make our trade promotion  programs more user-friendly  for businesses  and would target the markets where American  goods have the most chance of finding buy ers. Also,  it would clear  the  thicket of anti quated export controls  that are an albatross  around the neck of American exporters.  To complement such aggressive trade pro motion efforts, we must also develop an indus trial policy to help U.S. companies who com pete with foreign countries. Such an industrial  policy would include support for manufacturers  who  are  producing  break-through  export  goods.  The  Northeast-Midwest  Coalition's  Manufacturing Task Force in Congress is de signing such support in the form of a package  of tax incentives.  I am a member of the task  force, and I have invited the group to the 19th  District to hold hearings in the near future. We  plan to announce a legislative program by the  beginning of the year, and then work on a bi partisan basis to have it enacted.  The budget approved in August included a  good start in providing incentives to manufac turers by cutting the capital gains tax for long term  investments  in many small businesses.  Why not expand that cut to apply to long-term  investments  in  all domestic manufacturing?  And why not allow investors to roll over capital  gains into these new investments without pay ing new taxes? We do the same thing for peo ple who sell and buy homes within a year.  That way we encourage job growth and job re tention in industries here at home-rather than  export our jobs abroad.  Under such an aggressive trade and indus trial policy, Ohio and the 19th Congressional  District  that  I represent would  fare well. Re cently, I held an official hearing of the House  Space Subcommittee in my district to discuss  technology transfer between NASA Lewis and  local small businesses. The Federal officials  who participated were impressed at the high tech talent in this area and the Federal/private  sector  technology  sharing  already  taking  place. Also, in the award-winning Great Lakes  Technology Center and  the Cleveland Ad vanced Manufacturing Program,  the Greater  Cleveland area has the framework in place to  capitalize on a new, post-NAFTA, export-relat ed industrial policy.  Contrary  to what you may hear over  the  next  few days,  there  is not only  life after  NAFT A, but our industries can again become  the  leaders  in  innovative  and  technology based exports. For Ohio,  a  future without  NAFT A seems particularly bright.  NAFTA TAX CUT  HON. RON PACKARD  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 16, 1993  ",1993
