0,Senate,105,-0.303,14,1,Mr. DASCHLE.," Mr. President, can I  also make a comment? Let me, first,  compliment the distinguished Senator  from Minnesota for his adamant en dorsement of the need to move ahead  on campaign finance reform. I share his  utter  frustration  and  extraordinary  concern for  the current method with  which we  finance  our  campaigns.  I  share it to the degree that I intend to  offer, as the very first bill that I will  introduce,  in consultation, of course,  with our conference tomorrow, S. 11, a  campaign  finance  reform  bill  built  upon the remarkable work done by a  previous  majority  leader,  Senator  BYRD, years ago, as well as Senators  FEINGOLD, KERRY, and others who have  played a key role in this debate in the  past. I will do so with every expecta tion that we can succeed, at long last,  to  pass meaningful,  comprehensive  campaign  finance  reform  this year.  And I feel as strongly as the Senator  from Minnesota  that  the  legislation  should be considered as early as pos sible. It is long overdue.  But, as the majority leader has indi cated, some of that work  is already  being done, and there are other issues  that must also be considered on a time ly basis. For example, I am concerned and  I discussed  this again with  the  President as  recently as yesterday about the need to accelerate consider ation of the chemical weapons treaty,  because if we are not able to complete  our work on that particular measure  prior to the first part of April, we will  suffer  extraordinary  diplomatic  and  legal consequences in the international  community.  So not only do we have the budget,  but we  have  the  chemical weapons  treaty and a number of other issues  that will have  to be addressed. That  does not mean we cannot begin to work  and work through all of the issues re lating to campaign finance reform in a  timely, meaningful and, hopefully, bi partisan fashion. We must do that, but  we don't  need  immediate  floor  time  necessarily to do  that. We do need a  commitment on both sides  to begin  working together to finally enact fair,  meaningful reform.  I  I  The majority  leader has given me  that commitment in the discussions we  have had with regard to both the com mittees, as well as his  individual ef forts,  to come  to some resolution on  this matter. I am hopeful we can do  that.  So, in working with the Senator from  Minnesota, and certainly with the ma jority leader and others, I believe we  are off to a start that ought to ensure  some  optimism with  regard  to our  prospects for success on campaign fi nance reform this year.  ",1997
1,Senate,105,-0.583,14,1,Mr. WELLSTONE.," Mr. President, re serving the right to object, I appreciate  the discussions that I have had with  the majority leader and minority lead er. I was trying to get back to them as  they were going  through  the  resolu tions.  guess when  hear  the majority  leader and minority leader speak about  this and other business that we have to  transact, while  I absolutely am con vinced about their commitment, it just  brings into even sharper focus for me  the need for this body to make a com mitment: that we will by the end of 100  days have a bill on the floor of the Sen ate. We have been talking about this  for a long, long time. I don't have the  experience some Senators do. I am just  starting my second  term. But every  single time this has come up, speeches  have been made, and then we end up  not passing a reform bill. I think noth ing could be more important than for  us to make a commitment.  What about within the first 4 months  as opposed to the first 3 months? Can  the majority leader make a commit ment that he will do everything pos sible to try to have a bill on the floor  of the Senate within a 4-month period?  That is reasonable, and that is all I am  asking for.  I  think the majority leader is com mitted to  this. I want to say to my  friend, and he is a friend, that of course  I am not judging what the specific con tent will be. I am not requesting any  commitment to a particular content,  but  I  am  requesting a  commitment  that we go on record and-you know, if  we had to have a vote on this, then I  think it would be a vote as to whether  or not Senators, Democrats and Repub licans, are serious about taking action  within a 4-month period, which is very  reasonable. I do not know how many  votes there would be, but I think that  is what it is about. I want to be count ed as someone who is willing to make  a commitment to this.  Would the majority leader be willing  to make a commitment that certainly  with his considerable skill and ability  he will, along with the minority leader  with his skill and ability, that the two  of  them  together as  leadership, will  make a commitment that within the  first 4 months they will do everything  possible  to take action and have  the  debate that the people in the country  ",1997

3,Senate,105,0.391,66,1,Mr. THURMOND.," Mr. President, pur suant to section 304(b) of the Congres sional Accountability Act of 1995  (2  U.S.C. sec. 1384(b)), a notice of adoption  of regulation and submission for ap proval was submitted by the Office of  Compliance, U.S. Congress. The notice  contains  final  regulations  related  to  provisions of the Occupational Safety  and Health Act of 1970  (Regulations  under section 215 of the Congressional  Accountability Act of 1995.)  The  Congressional  Accountability  Act requires this notice be printed in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, therefore I  ask unanimous consent that the notice  be printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the notice  was  ordered  to  be  printed  in  the  RECORD, as follows:  OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE-THE CONGRESSIONAL  ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995: EXTENSION OF  RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS UNDER THE OCCU PATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT OF 1970  NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF REGULATION AND  SUBMISSION FOR APPROVAL  Summary: The Board of Directors, Office of  Compliance. after considering comments to  its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published  September 19,  1996,  in  the Congressional  Record, has adopted, and is submitting for  approval by the Congress, final regulations  implementing section 215  of  the Congres sional Accountability Act of 1995 (""CAA"").

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION  Background and Summary  The Congressional Accountability Act of  1995  (""CAA""), P.L. 104-1, was enacted into  law on January 23, 1995. 2 U.S.C. §§1301 et seq.  In general, the CAA applies the rights and  protections of eleven federal labor and em ployment statutes to covered employees and  employing  offices within  the  legislative  branch. Section 215(a) provides that each em ploying office and each covered employee  shall comply with the provisions of section 5  of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of  1970,  29 U.S.C.  §654  (""OSHAct""). 2 U.S.C.  §1341(a).  Section 215(d)  of  the CAA  requires  the  Board of Directors of the Office of Compli ance established under the CAA to issue reg ulations implementing the section. 2 U.S.C.  §1341(d). Section 215(d)  further states that  such regulations ""shall be the same as sub stantive regulations promulgated by the Sec retary of Labor to implement the statutory  provisions referred to in subsection (a) ex cept to the extent that the Board may deter mine, for good cause shown and stated to gether with the regulation, that a modifica tion of such regulations would be more effec tive for the implementation of the rights and  protections under this section."" Id. Section  215(d) further provides that the regulations  ""shall include a method of identifying, for  purposes of this section and for different cat egories of violations of subsection (a),  the  employing office responsible for correction  of a particular violation."" Id.  On September 19, 1996, the Board published  in the Congressional Record a Notice of Pro posed Rulema.king (""NPR"") (142 Cong. Rec.  S11019 (daily ed., Sept. 19, 1996)). In response  to the NPR, the Board received four written  comments,  two of which were from offices  within the Legislative Branch and two of  which were from labor organizations. After  full consideration of the comments received  in response to the proposed regulations, the  Board has adopted and is submitting these  regulations for approval by the Congress pur suant to section 304(c) of the CAA.  I. Summary of Comments and Board's Final  Rules  A. Request for additional rulemaking  proceedings  One commenter requested that the Board  withdraw its proposed regulations and en gage in what it terms ""investigative rule making,"" a process that apparently is to in clude discussions with involved parties re garding the nature and scope of the regula tions. This commenter expressed the concern  that affected parties had not been  suffi ciently involved in the rulemaking process  and have been discouraged from providing  meaningful comments. Specifically, the com menter objected to the following actions of  the Board: (1) providing a comment period of  no more than 30 days; (2) issuing a notice of  proposed rulemaking without first issuing an  advance notice of proposed rulemaking; (3)  issuing proposed regulations under section  215 concurrently with proposed regulations  under section 210 and shortly before the Con gress had adjourned sine die;  (4) stating in  the NPR that nomenclature and other tech nical changes were made to the adopted reg ulations. but not  specifically  cataloguing  each of those changes in the summary of the  proposed rules; and (5) not providing a record  of consultations between the Office and rep resentatives of the Department of Labor in  theNPR.  The Board has considered each of the above  concerns  and, after careful evaluation of  them, has determined  that  further  rule making proceedings, with their concomitant  costs and delay, are not warranted in this  context.  1. The request for an extended comment period  and for ""investigatory"" rulemaking.-The rule making procedure employed by the Board in  this context is substantially similar to that  employed by the Board with respect to every  other regulation promulgated thus far under  the CAA; and it complies with the required  procedures under section 304 of  the CAA.  Specifically, section 304(b) generally requires  the Board to issue a notice of proposed rule making and to provide a comment period of  at least 30 days. The Board has done so. Nor  is there any reason to believe that a signifi cant extension of the comment period be yond 30 days or a resort to alternative forms  of rulemaking would result in a different  rulemaking comment record, either quali tatively or quantitatively: The Board's rule making record includes an extensive report  from  its General Counsel-a report which  itself was prepared on the basis of an exten sive  investigation by  the General Counsel  and with the invited participation of all em ploying offices.  In addition,  the General  Counsel met with representatives of a num ber of employing offices prior to the inspec tions, including the Architect of the Capitol,  concerning the appropriate standards to be  applied  to  Legislative Branch  facilities.  Moreover, no commenter claimed an inabil ity in this rulemaking proceeding  to ade quately present its views  through written  submissions.  Indeed,  the only specific  re quest for an extension of the comment period  came from this particular commenter, who  requested an extension of only one day,  which was granted. No  request for further  time was sought by the commenter or by any  other person or organization. Finally, a re view of the comments received tends to rein force the Board's view that an extended com ment period, hearings, and/or other addi tional  forms  of  rulemaking  proceedings  would only  result  in  the addition  to  the  record of information which would at most  duplicate or corroborate  the written com ments without providing further insight into  or elucidation of the issues involved.  2. Failure to issue an Advance Notice of Pro posed Rulemaking.-Although not expressly  provided for in the Administrative Procedure  Act (""APA""), an advance notice of proposed  rulemaking (""ANPR"") is sometimes used by  administrative agencies to seek information  from the public to assist in framing a notice  of proposed rulemaking and to narrow the  issues during the public comment period on  the proposed rules ultimately developed. See,  e.g., 52 Fed. Reg. 38,794  (1987)  (preliminary  notice  for Medicare anti-kickback regula tions). Thus, in prior rulemakings, the Board  has sometimes used ANPRs to obtain views  regarding interpretation of statutory provi sions in the CAA  that had not previously  been interpreted by the Boa.rd and to obtain  general  information  regarding  conditions  within the Legislative Branch that may bear  on rulemaking questions. See, e.g., 141 Cong.  Rec. 814542 (daily ed. Sept. 28, 1995) (ANPR  seeking information regarding, inter alia, the  standard  for determining whether and  to  what  extent  regulations  under  the CAA  should be modified for ""good cause;"" wheth er regulations imposing notice posting and  recordkeeping  requirements  are  included  within the CAA; whether certain regulations  constituted ""substantive regulations;"" and  wkether the concept of ""joint employer sta tus""  is applicable under  the CAA).

6,,105,0.496,196,1,Mr. ARCHER.," Mr. Speaker, today I am  in troducing a joint resolution to amend the Con stitution  in order to mandate  the U.S. Con gress  to commit  to balancing  the Federal  budget and remove the burdens of large Fed eral deficits off of the American people. This  legislation is essential to the future of our Na tion as we stand on the threshold of the 21st  century. The costs of maintaining our national  debt have absorbed increasing proportions of  national savings  that would otherwise have  been available  to  finance  investment, either  public or private. Today,  interest payments  alone on the debt are the largest item  in the  budget, comprising over 20 percent of all Fed eral spending.  This  type or  irresponsible  spending and  management must end. Now the 1 OSth Con gress has the opportunity to do just that. My  balanced budget amendment is very similar to  the language that passed the House of Rep resentatives in 1995 by a vote of 300 to 132.  However, the most important distinction of my  amendment  from  the 1995  language  is  the  provision specifying the vote margin needed to  waive  the  balanced  budget  requirement.  Under the previously passed bill, three-fifths of  the whole House and Senate were required to  waive the balanced budget requirements. My  amendment sets a more stringent and impera tive requirement of two-thirds of those present  and voting-the same margin necessary  to  pass a constitutional amendment.  I hope that my colleagues, on both sides of  the aisle, agree that actions speak louder than  words. We've talked about our commitment to  balancing the budget for long enough, ifs time  to do it.  INTRODUCTION OF GUNS AND  DRUNKS LEGISLATION  HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR.  OF MICHIGAN  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 7, 1997  ",1997
7,,105,-0.658,196,1,Mr. CONYERS.," Mr. Speaker,  I wouldn't  have thought it was necessary tp introduce a  bill prohibiting gun sellers from selling guns to  obviously intoxicated individuals, but it is.  As the law stands, you can't sell alcohol to  someone who  is clearly drunk because  that  . person might hurt himself or others, but you  \Can sell a drunk a dangerous  firearm. Even  law, common sense might dictate  that you don't sell a gun to a drunk, but unfor tunately,  not everyone uses  their common  sense.  ~out a  Deborah Kitchen, a mother of five, was shot  by her ex-boyfriend and  left paralyzed  from  the neck down a mere half an hour after the  man  bought a $100  rifle at a K-Mart  in  Tampa, FL. The man had consumed a case of  beer and nearly a fifth of whiskey before he  bought the gun. He was so  incapacitated at  the time of the purchase that the store clerl<  had to fill out the Federal firearm registration  form.  Ms. Kitchen successfully sued K-Mart for  negligence, but the retail chain has appealed,  denying any  liability. K-Mart doesn't think  it  did anything wrong  in selling  the drunk the  gun that paralyzed Ms. Kitchen. If gun sellers  cannot act responsibly on their own, it is up to  us  to force them  to act responsibly. No one  should sell a gun to a drunk, period. My bill  would make it a Federal crime to sell a gun to  a drunk in an effort to ensure that there won't  be any more Deborah Kitchens in the future.  RECOGNIZING  THE  CONTRIBUTIONS OF MINNESOTAN HUMAN  RIGHTS  ADVOCATE  BARBARA  FREY  HON. BRUCE F. VENTO  OF MINNESOTA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 7, 1997  ",1997
8,,105,-0.472,196,1,Mr. VENTO.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  in  recognition of an extraordinary Minnesotan,  Barbara Frey. For 11 years as executive direc tor of Minnesota Advocates, an internationally  recognized human  rights organization which  has played an  instrumental part  in human  rights work, Ms. Frey has poured her tireless  energy and efforts  into  the establishment of  the cause of fighting human rights abuses on  a worldwide basis. While Barbara Frey will be  relinquishing that role,  I can safely predict as  her Representative and  friend  that she will  continue to make a major contribution to our  community and society. Ms. Frey's accom plishments will provide a sound basis and sta tus for her future work in Minnesota and inter nationally.  Some people have one job; Barbara Frey  has several.  In addition  to her work at Min nesota Advocates, Ms. Frey may add to her  resume work as an  adjunct  professor  of  human  rights at the University of Minnesota  Law School. In addition, every Sunday she de livers food-shelf donations to the needy from  St. Francis Cabrini Catholic Church. She also  coaches girls basketball and teaches a weekly  course at St. Paul's Expo Magnet School,  where her daughter, Maddie, is a student. Ms.  Frey recently paid a visit to the White House  on International Human Rights Day to be hon ored by President Clinton  for her efforts  to  promote women's rights.  Whether educating Minnesota's students or  reprimanding military  leaders about human  rights violations, Barbara Frey has approached  her valuable work with  the same passion of  conviction, courage, and purpose of mission.  St. Paul, MN, is fortunate to be home to this  most talented and dedicated individual, whose  work provides important lessons for us and for  our children.  I'm sure my colleagues will join  me in paying tribute to Ms. Frey, and I join in  applauding  her  numerous  local  and  inter national contributions. Her important work sig nifies a task well done on a subject that must  remain in our consciousness, both today and  tomorrow.  INTRODUCTION  OF  THE  RECON STRUCTIVE  BREAST  SURGERY  BENEFITS ACT OF 1997  HON. ANNA G. F.SHOO  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 7, 1997  ",1997
9,,105,-0.382,196,1,Ms. ESHOO.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to in troduce  the Reconstructive Breast Surgery  Benefits Act of 1997 to guarantee that insur ance companies cover the cost of reconstruc tive  breast  surgery  that  results  from  mastectomies  for which coverage  is already  provided. In addition, the legislation would se cure insurance coverage for all stages of re constructive breast surgery performed on a  nondiseased breast to establish symmetry with  the diseased one when reconstructive surgery  on the diseased breast is performed.  In 1995, an estimated 182,000 American  women were diagnosed with breast cancer,  and 85,000 of them underwent a mastectomy  as  part  of  their  treatment. Reconstructive  breast surgery often is an integral part of the  mental and physical recovery of women who  undergo this traumatic, disfiguring procedure.  Unfortunately,  insurance companies don't al ways see it that way. Even  though many of  them are willing to pay for mastectomies, they  sometimes balk at covering breast reconstruc tion. This legislation would put an end to this  shortsighted  practice  and  guarantee  that  women with breast cancer are not victimized  twice-first by the disease, then by their insur ance companies.  According to the American Society of Plastic  and Reconstructive Surgeons [ASPRS], a sig nificant number of women with breast cancer  must undergo mastectomy or amputation of a  breast  in order to treat their disease appro priately. The two most common  construction-tissue expansion followed by an  implant insertion and flap surgery-can restore  the breast mound  to a natural shape. Most  breast reconstruction requires a series of pro cedures that may include an operation on the  opposite breast for symmetry.  Even though studies show that fear of losing  a breast is a leading reason why many women  do not participate in early breast cancer detec tion programs, many general surgeons don't  types of re eTuis ""bullet"" symbol identifies statements or insertions which are not spoken by a Member of the Senate on the floor.

10,,105,0.366,209,1,Mr. KNOLLENBERG.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to introduce the Job Skill Development  Act of 1997. This  is a narrowly tailored bill  which amends the Fair labor Standards Act  [FLSA] of 1938 to ease some of the restric tions on volunteering.  The FLSA  requires covered employers  to  compensate  individuals defined as an  ""em ployee"" with minimum wage and overtime.  While there are numerous exceptions for vol unteers,  these exceptions primarily focus on  humanitarian and charitable activities. Unfortu nately,  individuals seeking  to gain valuable  work experience and exposure in a competi tive profession are often prohibited from doing  so because of restrictions on volunteering.  The  FLSA  revolves  around  a  complex  scheme of regulations and exceptions. When  the Department of Labor and  the Federal  courts determine who  is and  is not exempt,  they  take  into account  the  type of services  provided by the individual, who benefits from  the rendering of the services, and how long it  takes  to provide  the services. Some of the  most common exceptions are for trainees or  student  learners  better  known  as  interns.  These exceptions were developed because of  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  their educational benefit as well as the poten tial to learn valuable skills for future employ ment.  However, just as the FLSA protects some, it  can be an obstacle for others. Capitol Hill pro vides an excellent example. Each year hun dreds of college and high school students  travel to Washington, DC, for interships. Many  of these positions are unpaid or offer a sti pend, well below the minimum wage and over time  requirements. These  individuals gain a  better understanding of the legislative process,  develop office skills, and make contacts that  are invaluable in securing employment. Mean while, the employer is able to evaluate the in tern  in a work environment. For both  it is a  win-win situation.  Two particular individuals on my staff volun teered in my office for several months before  they were hired on as full-time paid employ ees. However,  because  these  two  staffers  were recent college graduates and produced  work that benefited my office, they would have  been prohibited  from volunteering  their serv ices if at the time I would have been forced to  comply with the FLSA.  Though Congress has since passed  the  Congressional Accountability Act  and  now  must adhere  to  the FLSA,  the point  is not  moot. Congress and hundreds,  if not  thou sands, of individuals over the years have ben efited from such programs. In fact, many have  become employed for the first time because of  the  opportunity  and  experience  they gain  through interning. I hope we could learn from  these  instances and not tum our backs on  those who wish to gain valuable work experi ence.  Moreover, as we enter the 21st century and  the global marketplace becomes even more  competitive, we must strive to help those who  wish  to enter the work force. Programs  like  Careers and School to Work offer some the  opportunity  to gain  the necessary skills  to  compete, but there is still room  for improve ment. Congress cannot standby and allow in dividuals  to  forego valuable  training experi ence because we have failed to act.  The Job Skill Development Act will offer out standing opportunities for future work forces.  Its passage will help college graduates and in dividuals who have been out of the work force  develop the professional skills and experience  they need to become employed. It is a great  job  training program  that does not cost  the  taxpayers a dime.  As  I mentioned before,  this  legislation  is  narrowly tailored and while it eases the restric tions on volunteer activity,  it does not jeop ardize the  important safeguards against em ployer  coercion  and worker  displacement.  Moreover, the intent is not to undermine any  of  the  requirements of minimum wage and  overtime, but focuses on providing individuals  with  the opportunity  to gain  the necessary  skills to become gainfully employed.  Mr. Speaker,  it  is time to give future work  forces  the same opportunity Congress and  many hill  staffers have benefited  from  for  many years. I look forward to working with my  colleagues on passage of the Job Skill Devel opment Act of 1997.  207  HOUSING LOAN GUARANTEE  PROGRAM EXTENSION ACTS  HON. DOUG BEREUI'ER  OF NEBRASKA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 7, 1997  Mr. BEREUTER, Mr. Speaker,  today  this  Member  is  introducing  two bills designed  to  extend  important alternatives  to  traditional  Federal housing direct lending.  The  first bill,  the Rural Multifamily Rental  Housing Loan Guarantee Extension Act of  1997, permanently authorizes the U.S. Depart ment of Agriculture [USDA] administered sec tion 538 program which, as the name implies,  guarantees repayment of loans to build multi family rental housing in rural communities. The  section 538 program was patterned after the  highly successful section 515  loan guarantee  program, which  is also administered by  the  USDA. While  the section 538 program was  only  fully authorized  in  the  last Congress  through the Housing Opportunity Program Ex tension Act of 1996, it has already been well  received in rural America and certainly merits  permanent authorization  in  the 105th Con gress.  The second bill this Member is introducing  today permanently authorizes the section 184  loan guarantee program  for  Indian housing,  which is administered by the U.S. Department  of Housing and Urban Development  [HUD].  This guarantee program, which I authored and  was enacted into law in 1992, is designed to  bridge the obstacles that have prevented pri vate lenders  from participating  in housing  fi nance on  Indian  trust  land. Because of the  unique trust status of these reservations, pri vate  lenders have been  reluctant  to make  loans due to the fact that they have no legal  recourse should  the borrower default. Under  the section 184 guarantee program, the Fed eral Government eliminates  this obstacle by  guaranteeing  that  the  lender will be  repaid  should the borrower default. This program has  already proven to be widely popular in Indian  country and  provides  incentive  for private  lenders  to participate  in housing one of our  Nation's most underserved populations.  Members should  remember and be  reas sured by the fact that the disposition of loan  guarantee programs provides oversight in that  Congress must appropriate loan subsidies for  all  loans to be guaranteed under these pro grams. Thus, the end result of such a perma nent authorization will be smoother operating  programs without  interruptions  resulting  from  expired authorizations and congressional over sight maintained through the annual appropria tions process.  Thank you Mr. Speaker. This Member  in vites his colleagues to join him as a cosponsor  of both of these important housing measures.  ",1997
11,,105,-0.321,222,1,Mr. RICHARDSON.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  proud to introduce legislation to provide Med icaid coverage  for all certified nurse practi tioners and clinical nurse specialists for serv ices they are legally authorized to perform.  Nurse  practitioners  provide  vital  primary  care services to the underserved populations  in our country.  It is time we take full advan tage of the quality, cost-effective primary care  provided by nurse practitioners.  The  legislation  I am  introducing would en able all nurse practitioners, regardless of spe cialty,  to provide care to Medicaid recipients.  Currently, patients are able to access the care  of certain nurse practitioners such as  family  and pediatric nurse practitioners, but others  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  such as adult and women's health nurse prac titioners are not accessible.  Over 400 studies have confirmed  that the  health care provided by nurse practitioners in  a variety of urban and rural primary care set tings  is of  the highest quality. Nurse practi tioners are particularly  capable  to  provide  health care to the indigent. Their educational  programs emphasize the provision of care to  patients who have limited financial resources.  In a national survey conducted by the Amer ican Academy of Nurse Practitioners, over 60  percent of  the patients seen by these pro viders  had  family  incomes  of  less  than  $16,000 per year. Nurse practitioners rate as  high in financial efficiency as they do in con sumer satisfaction. Their ability  to  focus on  preventative and  curative medical  services  contribute to the quality as well as the cost-ef fectiveness of the care they provide.  It is well known that a majority of our under served populations are  located  in  rural and  inner city settings across  the Nation. While  nurse practitioners are willing and able to pro vide services in  these settings, not all nurse  practitioners are currently being reimbursed by  Medicaid for their services in these areas.  Nurse practitioners can play a central role in  achieving our national goal of providing qual ity, cost-efficient health care for all citizens.  I  am hopeful this  legislation will help to elimi nate disparities in access to care for rural and  inner city Medicaid populations by providing  direct  reimbursement  to nurse practitioners  and clinical nurse specialists who have proven  their ability to deliver quality care in a cost ef fective manner.

Even more  tragically,  the U.S. Government has been a  willing partner in this affair, and the sad con sequence  is  the sacrifice of something  far  more important than just principle.  One of the things that sets America apart  from  the rest of the world  is the fact that in  this country, everyone is equal before the law.  Regardless of race,  religion, or background,  each person has fundamental  rights that are  guaranteed by the law. However, we too often  overlook the rights of perhaps the most vulner able among us-the unborn. When abortion is  legal and available on demand,  then where  are the rights of the unborn? When abortion is  sanctioned and sometimes paid  for by  the  Government, then how do we measure the de gree to which life has been cheapened? When  an  innocent life is taken before its time, then  how can one say that this is justice in Amer ica?  My amendment would establish beyond a  doubt the fundamental right to life. Congress  has an obligation to do what it has failed to do  January 7, 1997  for so long, fully protect the unborn. I urge this  body to move forward with  this  legislation  to  put an end to a most terrible injustice.  INTRODUCING  THE  SECOND  NA TIONAL BLUE RIBBON COMMIS SION TO ELIMINATE WASTE  IN  GOVERNMENT-A  NEW  GRACE  COMMISSION  HON. RANDY ""DUKE"" CUNNINGHAM  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 7, 1997  ",1997
13,,105,0.411,222,1,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  introduce  legislation  to create  the  Second National Blue Ribbon Commission to  Eliminate Waste in Government Act. This leg islation  is similar to H.R. 217 from the 104th  Congress. Building upon  the example set by  the Grace Commission in 1982-84, my legis lation creates an  independent private sector  commission to help Congress eliminate Gov ernment waste.  The Grace Commission,  officially  estab lished as  the Presidenf s Private Sector on  Cost Control in the Federal Government, mar shaled  the considerable private  sector  re sources of more than 2,000 business profes sionals at no cost to  the  taxpayers. After 2  years of investigating the Federal Government  for more cost-effective ways of doing the Na tion's business, the Grace Commission deliv ered  its  final  report to President Reagan  in  1984. This effort yielded more  than 2,000  commonsense, cost-cutting recommendations,  two-thirds of which have become  law and  saved taxpayers nearly $450 billion.  In addi tion, this commission helped establish the pri vate, nonpartisan organization known as Citi zens Against Government Waste.  Building upon  that example, my  legislation  establishes a commission to take several addi tional steps toward curbing waste in Govern ment. First, the commission would survey the  private sector for management and cost con trol methods to be used  in the Federal Gov ernment. Second, the panel would conduct in depth reviews of executive branch operations.  Third, the panel would review and reevaluate  past reports by agencies such as  the Con gressional Budget Office and the Gene.ral Ac counting Office.  This 12-member commission would be ap pointed by the President and  the bipartisan  leadership of Congress, with no more than six  members of the same political party. After the  thorough review, the commission would report  its  findings and  recommendations  to Con gress. The commission's finding would serve  as a basis for Congress to reduce waste and  streamline Government operations.  I hope that all my colleagues will join me to  promote greater fiscal responsibility and more  effective Government by cosponsoring  this  legislation.    ",1997
14,,105,0.402,235,1,Mr. GALLEGLY.," Mr. Speaker, today I am in troducing legislation which is designed to cor rect a drafting error which appeared in Public  Law 104-208 and which pertains to the ability  of ineligible aliens to receive Federal housing  assistance.  Amendments made  to section 214 of the  Housing Act, as incorporated into the Immigra tion Reform bill adopted  last year, were de signed  to make  it more difficult  for  illegal  aliens to receive housing assistance. The fact  is,  illegals are currently receiving housing as sistance and every day newly arrived  illegal  aliens are applying for assistance. HUD, in the  past has been very inconsistent in enforcing  the laws designed to prevent this funding from  going to ineligible families.  Unfortunately,  in attempting  to correct  the  obvious flaws in the law, we made a drafting  mistake and now HUD is threatening to make  the proverbial mountain out of the mole hill.  In considering the potential problems large  public housing authorities may encounter as  they try to implement mandatory verification of  citizenship or immigration status of all appli cants for housing assistance, the Senate tried  to provide an opt-out provision which would  allow HA's to grant housing assistance before  all verification was completed if the verification  process was taking too long or if the waiting  period began  to result in an unusual amount  of vacant units. While House Members were  at first reluctant to put this opt-out into statu tory  language,  it was  included  in  the  final  version of the bill signed into law.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  Unfortunately, HUD has now interpreted the  opt-out language to mean that HA's could opt out of the entire section 214.  In other words,  If HUD's view prevailed, HA's could  legally  give housing assistance to illegal aliens with out any questions being asked. Needless to  say,  I totally disagree with  the  interpretation  the Department has  rendered on  the  issue.  How HUD's lawyers could come to the conclu sion that while adopting legislative changes to  section 214, which were intended to make  it  more difficult for illegal aliens who have been  determined by  the HA's  to be  ineligible  for  new or continued assistance,  the Congress  would  then  intend  to allow the HA's to tum  around and not enforce section 214, is beyond  me.  For the record, and as the principal author  of the section 214 changes, I will again, state  that under no circumstance did the Congress  intend any  interpretation  of  the  legislation  which gives any HA the option of following the  law as written in section 214.  It is clear to me, as it was to all of the Mem bers  involved, that the author of the opt out  only intended to allow HA's with high turnover  to be able to place families in housing without  having to wait for a verification from the INS.  Again,  it  is  inconceivable  to me how HUD  could say that our intent was to allow HA's to  completely  ignore a  law we were  trying  to  tighten.  The effect of HUD's conclusions would sug gest that HUD  is now telling the HA's that if  they do not want to enforce section 214 they  do not have to. This means that HUD is telling  the HA's  that  they may now elect  to grant  housing assistance to illegal aliens or continue  to provide assistance  to  illegals even after  they had been determined to be ineligible. I do  not believe this  is the official position of the  Department.  My  legislation  is  intended  to clear up any  doubt among HUD or the housing authorities.  APPRECIATION TO THE PEOPLE  OF MASSACHUSETTS 3D DISTRICT  HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN  OF MASSACHUSETTS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 7, 1997  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today I took  my oath of office  to  represent  faithfully  the  people of the 3d district of Massachusetts. As  I stood on the floor of the House with my 6year-old niece, Courtney,  I remembered  the  faces of all the families-the men, women and  children-with whom I'd met throughout the 3d  district during this past year. The pledge I took  today is to work in support of their dreams and  aspirations, not only for today, but for the lives  of their children and grandchildren.  To be elected to the House of Representa tives is to take on a sacred trust.  I feel privi leged and deeply appreciative to the people of  the 3d Congressional District. And on this day,  I honor you and your faith in America and our  joint future.  233  RURAL HOUSING LOAN SERVICING  PRIVATIZATION ACT  HON. GARY ~ CONDIT  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 7, 1997  ",1997
15,,105,-0.103,235,1,Mr. CONDIT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to in troduce the Rural Housing Loan Servicing Pri vatization Act.  Since 1988  the Congress has mandated  that  the  Farmers  Home  Administration  [FmHA], now the Rural Development Adminis tration  [RDA] establish an escrow accounting  system for the section 502 single-family hous ing program. It is now 1997 and little progress  has been made towards this goal. Since 1990,  FmHA has been studying the benefits and ad vantages of centralizing and contracting out  the section 502 program.  A review of efforts to improve the delivery of  the section 502 single family-housing program  shows  that the program  is  troubled by mis management, an unwieldy structure and  infe rior technology. by FmHA's own admission, it  costs $20 million per year to maintain a sys tem  that inadequately monitors the program.  Because this system cannot be redesigned to  maintain a mortgage escrowing program,  the  agency must pay an additional $20 million per  year to voucher property taxes for borrowers.  This practice  is detrimental  to both  the bor rower and the lender.  In September of 1992, studies by the FmHA  and GAO concluded that estimated operating  savings could be around $106 million by mak ing these reforms. Unfortunately, trivial action  has been  taken  towards  this end at a time  when the Congress and the Federal Govern ment are working  towards  reorganizing and  streamlining Government.  The Rural Housing Loan Servicing Privatiza tion Act, will move  this process along. This  legislation would require the Secretary of Agri culture  to  implement centralized servicing  in  the section 502 housing program by entering  into contracts with entities ""qualified and expe rience conducting loan servicing.""  One important aspect that this bill provides  is competition between Federal Government  and private entities for borrowers. Allowing pri vate companies to compete for the borrowers  currently serviced at the local level would fun damentally change  the way  the RDA does  business. It could also mean reaping the ben efits of the competitive marketplace, greater  efficiency, increase focus on customer needs,  and improving morale.  Given the budget and fiscal restraints facing  Congress, I believe now is the time for us to  work towards the goal of Rural Housing Loan  Servicing Privatization Act. By doing this we  would  lower delinquency  rates,  reduce  loan  losses, have escrow account ability, and lower  operating costs.  H.R.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.  This Act may be cited as the ""Rural Hous ing Loan Servicing Privatization Act"".  ",1997
16,,105,0.216,248,1,Mr. LAZIO of New York.," Mr. Speaker, today  I am  introducing the Homeless Housing Pro grams Consolidation and Flexibity Act of 1997,  a bill designed  to help one of this Nation's  most vulnerable populations, the homeless.  Homelessness  is one of the Nation's most  pressing social dilemmas. As much as half of  the adult homeless population has a current or  past substance abuse problem, and up to one third has severe mental illness.  The Federal Govemmenfs most potent tool  for responding to homelessness has been the  1987 McKinney Act with emergency food and  shelter programs. This reflected the belief that  homelessness was temporary in nature. When  homelessness  continued  to  intensify, more  programs were created and Federal policy be came muted  through a multitude of Federal  programs, creating the current collage of pro grams so in need of consolidation.  The General Accounting Office reports that  the  application  and  recordkeeping  require ments of the various McKinney programs are  overly burdensome and sometimes conflicting  or duplicative;  this places a great strain on  nonprofits.  When  provided  with  stable,  permanent  housing and flexible support services, formerly  homeless persons with severe mental  illness  are able to greatly decrease their use of costly  acute psychiatric hospital care and emergency  room  treatment.  In Boston, a study of home less people with severe mental illness showed  that after a year and a half, 78 percent re mained  in housing, and only 11 percent re turned to streets or shelters.  When provided with permanent supportive  housing, graduates of chemical dependency  treatment programs are able  to greatly  in crease their rates of sobriety. A study by Eden  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  programs, a Minneapolis social service pro vider, tracked 201 graduates of a chemical de pendency treatment program-90 percent who  had supportive  living a year  later  remained  sober.  Despite a significant proportion of homeless  individuals suffering  from mental or physical  disabilities, we must also recognize a portion  of the homeless community, particularly fami lies, that because of economic tragedies, are  without permanent homes. It is this population  that we too must concentrate our efforts to en sure  that  they don't evolve  into mental or  physical disabilities.  Mr. Speaker, as with the other bills I am in troducing today,  I intend to work in a bipar tisan manner with my colleagues to make sure  that  low-income  families and American  payers get the relief they deserve as quickly  as possible.  tax HOMELESS HOUSING PROGRAMS CONSOLIDATION  AND FLEXIBILITY ACT  SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS  Section 1: Title cited as  the ""Homeless  Housing Programs Consolidation and Flexi bility Act.""  Section 2: Findings and Purpose conclude  that a consolidation of the 7 existing McKin ney Homeless Housing programs would pro vide flexibility and allow states, localities,  and non-profits the ability to provide hous ing to homeless individuals with coordina tion of needed supportive services  through  other agencies.  Section 3: General Provisions provide tech nical changes to the McKinney Act.  Section 4:  Permanent Housing Develop ment and Flexible Block Grant Homeless As sistance Program is created and replaces ex isting Title IV of the Stewart B. McKinney  Homeless Act as follows:  Subtitle A-General Provisions  Sec. 401: Purpose is established to provide  assistance for permanent housing develop ment and flexible homeless housing assist ance.  Sec. 402: Grant Authority allows the HUD  Secretary to provide grants to states, metro politan cities, urban counties, and insular  areas under subtitles B (Permanent Housing  Development) and C (Flexible Block Grant  Homeless Assistance).  Sec.  Eligible Grantees  are  insular  areas  (or designees) and recipients  (state,  metropolitan city or urban county) of Per manent Housing Development and the Flexi ble Homeless Block Grant Assistance Pro grams.  Sec. 404: Use of Project Sponsors provides  criteria from which the eligible grantee may  select entities to carry out its eligible ac tivities.  Sec. 405: Comprehensive Housing Afford ability Strategy Compliance requires each  jurisdiction (eligible grantee) to submit and  comply with the requirements of the com prehensive  housing  affordability  strategy  under Sec. 105 of the Cranston-Gonzalez Na tional Affordable Housing Act.  Sec. 406: Allocation and Availability of  Amounts  requires,  at enactment,  20%  of  total funds made for the Permanent Housing  Development Grants, with  a  transitional  sliding scale upward to 30%  in the fourth  year of the bill;  the Flexible Block Grant  Homeless Assistance, at enactment. receives  80% of total funds with a transitional sliding  scale down to 70% in the fourth year and a  sliding scale cap on the amounts used for  supportive services from 30%, at enactment.  403:  January 7, 1997  to 15%  in the fourth year. The permanent  housing development grants are totally com petitive at the national level;  the Flexible  Block Grant is allocated with 70% for metro politan cities and urban counties and 30% for  states. based on a formula in the Housing  and Community Development Act of 1974 (or  the Emergency Shelter Grant formula). A  minimum appropriated threshold amount of  $750 million is required for block grant and  permanent development housing. Otherwise,  all the homeless funds are nationally com petitive.  Sec.  407: Matching Funds Requirements  provide for each eligible grantee to match at  least 50% of the federal funds received, un less the grant is less than $100,000. The eligi ble grantee  is restricted from  transferring  matching requirements to a project sponsor  or other non-profit carrying out the jurisdic tion's homeless activities to no more than a  25% match of federal funds. Matches include  (i) value of donated material, (ii) value of  building lease.  (iii) proceeds from bond fi nancing with limitations, (iv) amount of sal ary paid to staff, and (v) the cost or value of  donated goods, without including the value  of any time or services contributed by volun teers.  Sec. 408: Program Requirements provide  the Secretary with the authority to estab lish the application, form and procedure for  acquiring homeless grants. Under the Perma nent Housing Development Grants or Flexi ble Block Grant Homeless Assistance, eligi ble grantees must provide detailed descrip tions of the activities planned. The eligible  grantee or project sponsor is authorized to  charge an occupancy charge from assisted in dividuals, capped at a maximum 30% of in come. Eligible grantees and project sponsors  are required to have at least one homeless  individual as a member of the board of direc tors unless the Secretary provides a waiver.  Administrative expenses are capped at 5% of  federal funds received or 7 .5% in cases where  the recipient utilizes a standardized home less database management system to record  and assess the use of housing, services and  homeless individual. Housing Quality Stand ards are keyed to local housing standards;  and in the absence of local codes, a federal  housing quality standard is enforced.  This section requires coordination and con sultation between HUD and other  federal  agencies who have grant programs where eli gible activities include homeless assistance,  e.g. HHS, Labor, Education, VA, and Agri culture. Such coordination would provide for  other agency funding for companion services  to HUD housing grants. In the event of fail ure to coordinate or provide sufficient serv ices, HUD and the Interagency Council on  the Homeless would  create a  companion  service block grant, capped at the authorized  amounts for Title IV McKinney Appropria tions, which this bill authorizes at $1 billion.  Use restrictions are applicable to perma nent and supportive service housing, requir ing at least a 20 year use with requirements  for repayment or conversion monitored by  the Secretary.  Local advisory boards are required to as sist and provide professional and community  assistance in creating. monitoring and evalu ating local homeless initiatives using federal  funds.  Sec. 409: Supportive Services are required  for each homeless housing facility to meet  specifically the needs of the residents, and  include activities such as child care, employ ment assistance, outpatient health services,  housing  location,  security  arrangements,  and case-management coordination of bene fits.

17,,105,0.357,261,1,Mr. NETHERCUTT.," Mr. Speaker, as Co Chair of the Congressional Diabetes Caucus,  it is with pleasure that I support the Medicare  Diabetes Education  and  Supplies Amend ments of 1997,  introduced  today by Rep resentative ELIZABETH FURSE. Representative  FURSE and I formed the Congressional Diabe tes Caucus to promote awareness of diabetes  and  its consequences within Congress. This  bill is an important step toward providing dia betics with the tools they need to control the  negative repercussions and cost of diabetes.  When my daughter, Meredith, was diag nosed with the disease in 1987, I became ac tively  involved with  learning more about the  disease,  its causes,  complications and  the  cost to American society. Before entering Con gress,  I also served as president of the Spo kane chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foun dation.  Over 16 million Americans suffer from dia betes. The resulting financial cost to society is  staggering. An estimated $138 billion or 14  percent of U.S. health care dollars, is spent on  diabetes. The  last several years have been  encouraging for those working  to find better  treatments and a cure. Last year, doctors suc cessfully  transplanted  insulin-producing cells  into patients with type I diabetes. Researchers  have also located genetic markers for diabe tes, which should make it possible to identify  patients at high risk. Additionally, the vaccine  BCG has induced long-term remission of dia betes if given during the earliest stage of the  disease.  I am confident that a cure  for diabetes  is  within our reach.  In  the meantime, however,  the Federal government must avail itself of ad vances in treatment knowledge. In the private  sector, we have seen that comprehensive dia betes education  reduces both diabetes spe cific  complications and overall health  care  costs. For example, Merck-Medco Managed  Care, Inc. has realized a total per diabetic pa tient health care cost reduction of $441 since  beginning an  innovative diabetes education  program.  The Medicare Diabetes Education and Sup plies Amendments of 1997 will employ some  of the knowledge learned in the private sector  by providing diabetes self-management train ing under Medicare. The bill will also expand  coverage of blood testing strips to include all  people with type II diabetes. Self-management  training and access to blood testing strips are  crucial to controlling the high health care costs  associated with this disease. It is known that  when diabetics keep their blood glucose level  as close  to normal as possible,  the risk of  complications can be reduced by as much as  65 percent.  I encourage my colleagues to support this  legislation.  I am including for the RECORD the following  statements  from organizations  in support of  this legislation: The American Diabetes Asso ciation, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the  American Association of Diabetes Educators,  the American Dietetic Association,  the Endo crine Society, Eli Lilly and Co., and the Com munity Retail Pharmacy Coalition.  STATEMENT BY THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSO CIATION IN SUPPORT OF LEGISLATION TO IM PROVE MEDICARE  COVERAGE  FOR  PEOPLE  WITH DIABETES  There are few, if any, issues facing the na tion that have stronger bipartisan support  than the diabetes Medicare reform legisla tion being introduced today by Representa tives  Elizabeth  Furse  and  George  Nethercutt. There are none, in our opinion,  for which there is a greater need.  Diabetes is a prevalent, serious and costly  disease and is increasing at a shocking rate.  Since the '60s the number of cases has tripled  to 16 million. Since 1992, the direct costs of  caring for people with diabetes have doubled  to its current sum of $91.1 billion a year.  This figure does not begin to account for the  staggering  losses  in productivity  for our  economy and well-being to Americans. When  indirect costs are  included, diabetes costs  our economy nearly $138 billion a year, more  than any other single disease.  Medicare alone spends one-quarter of its  budget, nearly $Z1 billion a year,  treating  people with diabetes. Approximately half of  all diabetes cases occur in people older than  55 years of age. However, the complications  and hospitalizations associated with the dis ease (blindness. amputation, kidney failure,  heart disease and stroke) can be delayed or  avoided altogether with proper care. Our na tion is only now coming to this realization.  The  improvement  in diabetes  care em bodied in this legislation represents the only  preventive care measure ever scored (ana lyzed for its economic implications) by the  Congressional Budget Office  (CBO)  to save  money. According to the CBO analysis, each  day Congress waits to enact these Medicare  reforms  costs  taxpayers  an  additional  $500,000.  This  legislation, which  incorporates  two  bills introduced in the 104th Congress, H.R.  1073 and H.R. 1074, has widespread support on  both sides of the aisle. H.R. 1073 had 250 co sponsors in the last Congress. Of the more  than 4,000 bills introduced in the 104th Con gress, only 12 had more cosponsors.  During  the  fall  election  campaign,  180  members of  the  incoming 105th Congress  demonstrated support for improving diabetes  coverage by completing the American Diabe tes Association's Diabetes '96 Candidate Sur vey. Two hundred and eighty-nine (289) Mem bers of the 105th Congress either cosponsored  legislation or signed the Candidate survey.  Of the 289 supporters, 116 (40.1%) are Repub licans and 173 (59.9%) are Democrats.  Leaders of both political parties have stat ed their strong support for this legislation.  This legislation was  included in President  Clinton's FY '97 budget proposal and accord ing to the White House, will be included in  FY '98. Minority Leader Gephardt has noted  that the provisions of the bill, if enacted,  ""would help every individual and family cop ing with diabetes and save billions of dollars  in future Medicare spending.""  Speaker Gingrich  cosponsored  identical  legislation (H.R. 4264) in the 104th Congress  and has said that addressing diabetes is one  of his top four legislative priorities. During  the fall election campaign, Presidential can didate Robert Dole noted  that ""improved  Medicare and private insurance coverage of  necessary diabetes supplies and education  would save lives and reduce the cost of diabe tes-related illnesses to both the taxpayer and  the private sector.""  The growing awareness of the seriousness  of diabetes, along with the strong support of  President Clinton,  Speaker Gingrich  and  Congress, is crystal-clear mandate for imme diate action to improve Medicare coverage  for diabetes. There is no reason to wait. AIJ:Y  delay necessarily risks the health of the 3  million seniors diagnosed with diabetes and  will waste millions of taxpayers dollars.  ExPAND  TO  DIABETES-RE JDF  SUPPORTS  LEGISLATION  MEDICARE  COVERAGE  FOR  LATED SERVICES  The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Inter national (JDF), which gives more money di rectly to diabetes research than any other  non-profit  health  agency  in  the world,  strongly supports expedited passage of legis lation which would make available to mil lions of older Americans the diabetes self management  training and critical  testing  equipment needed to attain better control of  blood glucose  levels,  thereby  helping  to  delay debilitating and life-threatening com plications. It is imperative that, while we  pursue the longer-term objective of a cure  for diabetes through research, all people bat tling this inSidious and devastating disease  have access to the most advanced, proven di abetes management  regimens  and  tech nologies availab!e. This additional Medicare  coverage makes tremendous economic sense  for the country as well, given the fact that  treatment for diabetes-related complications  accounts for more  than '1:1 percent of the  total Medicare budget.  Despite medical  and  technological  ad vances, people with diabetes continue to die  and suffer life-threatening complications as  a result of the disease. JDF believes that ul timately, through research advances, a cure  for diabetes and its devastating complica tions will be found, resulting in millions of  lives and billions of dollars saved. The public  and private secw support for diabetes re search has led tcr substantial progress. The  Congress' steadfast support for medical re search funding through the National Insti tutes of Health has not only brought us clos er to a cure for diabetes, it has also produced  ",1997

19,,105,-0.31,365,1,Mr. KLINK.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today  in  order to commemorate the 50th anniversary of  Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 8805 in Hope well Township.  Named after Robert W. Young,  the  first  Hopewell resident killed  in duty during World  War II. Young was killed when his ship, the  USS Sims, was sunk by Japanese airplanes in  the Battle of the Coral Sea on May 7, 1942.  VFW Post 8805  is currently home to over  600 veteran members and 280 ladies' auxiliary  members. Many of these people are charter  members of Post 8805. The  first members  were those returning from Europe and the Pa cific and every other theater of World War II.  From the beginning, VFW Post 8805 has been  made up of citizen heroes, who  left  their  homes and  loved ones to undergo incredible  hardships and sacrifices  in defense of our  freedoms. Fortunately,  these people returned  home  to become  some of  the most out standing members of the community. Contrib uting in peace as they had contributed in war.  A special salute to Ernest Parisi and Rich ard Paxton,  two of the founding members of  VFW Post 8805. Without their perseverance,  the dream of Post 8805 would not have be come a reality. They and all the members are  a fine  representation of the Fourth Congres sional District.  Mr. Speaker, let us never forget the honor,  courage, and valor displayed by all the mem bers of the VFW. They have done a great  service to our country. I ask you and all mem bers  to  join me  in a special salute  to VFW  Post 8805.  A TRIBUTE TO ALBERT TEGLIA  HON. TOM LANTOS  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 9, 1997  ",1997
20,,105,-0.376,365,1,Mr. LANTOS.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I rise to  recognize the outstanding achievements of Al bert Teglia, a man who has dedicated his life  not only to public office, but to public service.  His  dedication  and  devotion  to  duty  has  helped countless numbers of San Francisco  Bay area residents with problems ranging from  fixing  the burdensome Tax Code  to  fixing a  burnt-out street light. For the past 20 years, Al  Teglia's humor, compassion, and dedication to  duty has been a source of inspiration to all of  us who serve the public.  Al Teglia served five terms in the Daly City  Council and  four  terms as mayor. He has  served on numerous boards and commissions  including  the Airport Land Use Committee,  California School Board Association, League  of California Cities, the Peninsula Joint Pow ers Board, and many others. He was  instru mental  in negotiating  the BART  [Bay Area  Rapid Transit] Colma extension and spearEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  headed  the Orthodontia Program  for San  Mateo County. His outstanding achievements  have been  recognized by awards  from  the  San Mateo Hispanic Council, the Italian Amer ican Federation, San Mateo Easter Seals, and  Daly City Jaycee to name just a few.  The son of Genoese immigrants, Al Teglia  has lived on the San Mateo Peninsula all his  life. He and his wife of 43 years, Verna, share  a  love and joy for the bay area community.  Too often these days people complain about  this problem or that situation without ever lift ing a finger to try and help solve it. People like  Al Teglia remind us that a community is only  as strong as  the people  in  it. Al has given  back so much to the community which raised  him, we should all look to him as an example.  People can actually point to Al Teglia and say,  ""He helped make my life better."" This is the  penultimate compliment for a public servant.  I hold Al Teglia in the highest regard. There  is no task too daunting and no issue too small.  Wrth an uncompromising dedication  to duty  and service, he has touched many lives in the  San Francisco Bay area. His presence on the  Daly City Council will be sorely missed, but I  am pleased he will remain active in the com munity. His undying devotion and dogmatic  determination to serve his community should  serve as inspiration to all who aspire to public  service.  TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT  LEWIS F .M. SCOTT  HON. FLOYD SPENCE  OF SOUTH CAROLINA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 9, 1997  ",1997
21,,105,0.32,365,1,Mr. SPENCE.," Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure  for me to pay tribute today to a truly excep tional Marine, Staff Sergeant Lewis F.M. Scott,  who will soon complete his assignment as the  Marine Corps' congressional liaison staff non commissioned officer. For the past 31/2 years,  Staff Sergeant Scott has provided a tremen dous service to the Members of Congress and  to all of our constituents. His dedication and  professionalism, coupled with his warm per sonality, have endeared him to many of us on  Capitol Hill, and we will miss him very much.  A native of Felton, DE, Lewis Scott enlisted  in the Marine Corps on January 28, 1983, and  attended recruit training in Parris  Island, SC.  After boot camp and specialty training in ad ministration, he was assigned  to  the Marine  Corps Air Ground Combat Center at  29  Palms, CA, as a clerk for the 3d Assault Am phibian Battalion. In April of 1985, he received  orders to the 3d Reconnaissance Battalion in  Okinawa, Japan where he served with distinc tion until his transfer to the Logistics Base in  Barstow, CA 1 year later. From July 1988 until  June 1991, he served with  the 12th Marine  Corps District Headquarters in San Francisco  before being reassigned to Headquarters, Ma rine Corps here  in Washington where he  served for 2 years.  On May 30, 1996, Staff Sergeant Scott re ported for duty with the Marine Corps' House  Liaison Office and  immediately assumed  re sponsibilities  for coordinating, executing and  supervising numerous tasks normally assigned  363  to commissioned officers. He often served as  a spokesperson on Marine Corps issues and  rapidly established a reputation for exactness,  professionalism, and integrity among Members  of Congress,  congressional  staff members,  and his peers in the Liaison Office.  During his career on Capitol Hill, Staff Ser geant Scott  responded  to over 4,000  tele phonic inquiries from over 900 Congressional  offices  throughout  the country and ensured  that our constituents received timely and com plete answers. He was  instrumental  in plan ning, coordinating and escorting Members and  congressional staff on  fact  finding  trips.  In  short, Staff Sergeant Scott's performance  is  consistent with  the quality performance we  have come to expect from our U.S. Marines.  During Staff Sergeant Scott's 14-year ca reer, he and his family made many sacrifies  for this Nation. I would like to thank them all Lewis, his lovely wife, Angelia, and their three  children, Christopher, Lewis, and Shannon for  their contributions to the Marine Corps.  Mr. Speaker, Staff Sergeant Scott is a great  attribute to the U.S. Marine Corps and to the  country he so faithfully serves. As he prepares  to depart for new challenges on an unaccom panied tour in Okinawa, Japan, I know that my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join  me in wishing him every success, as well as  fair winds and following seas.  AMERICA'S  VETERANS  HAVE  EARNED  EMPLOYMENT,  TRAIN ING AND  SMALL BUSINESS OP PORTUNITIES  HON. BOB Fil.NER  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 9, 1997  ",1997
22,,105,-0.652,365,1,Mr. FILNER.," Mr. Speaker,  it has been my  privilege to serve on the House Committee on  Veterans' Affairs since  I was  first elected to  Congress 4 years ago, and I look forward to  continuing that service in the 1 OS th Congress.  I asked to serve on the Veterans' Affairs Com mittee because  I believe  that  the men and  women who  serve  in our Nation's Armed  Forces are special members of our American  family. Because of their service, the rest of us  are able to fully enjoy the freedoms on which  our country was founded. We have a unique  debt to our veterans, and, as a member of the  Veteran's Committee, I have worked to ensure  that that debt is repaid.  On January 7, 1997,  the  first day of the  1 OSth Congress, I introduced three bills of par ticular importance to veterans and members of  the Reserves and National Guard. We have a  longstanding national commitment to provide  special assistance for veterans who want em ployment and  training assistance, and  these  bills will help us fulfill that commitment.  Last year, a Supreme Court ruling mistak enly eliminated a portion of the job protection  we have provided for 50 years for people who  serve  in  the Reserves and National Guard.  Because of this ruling, citizen soldiers who are  also employees. of a State government are at  risk of not being restored to their civilian jobs  following their military service. H.R. 166, the  Veterans' Job Protection Act, would restore re employment protection for these individuals by  ",1997
23,,105,0.238,378,1,Mr. SAXTON.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I am  pleased  to  introduce  the Marine Resources  Revitalization Act of 1997, a bill to reauthorize  the National Sea Grant College Program.  By way of background,  the National Sea  Grant College Program was established by  Congress in 1966 in an effort to improve our  Nation's marine resource conservation efforts,  to better manage those resources, and to en hance  their proper utilization. Housed within  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin istration, Sea Grant is modeled after the highly  successful Land Grant College Program cre ated in 1862.  Over the past 30 years, Sea Grant has dra matically defined our capabilities to make deci sions about marine, coastal, and Great Lakes  resources-vast,  publicly  owned  resources  which are of vital economic, social, and cul tural importance to our rapidly growing coastal  populations. In doing so, Sea Grant promotes  high quality, peer-reviewed scientific research.  Furthermore, Sea Grant distributes scientific  results  regionally and  locally  through  edu cational and advisory programs at over 300  universities and affiliated  institutions nationJanuary 9, 1997  wide. Twenty-nine of  these are specifically  designated as Sea Grant colleges or institu tional programs, and they serve to coordinate  Sea Grant activities on a State-by-State basis.  The Marine Resources Revitalization Act of  1997 authorizes funding for Sea Grant through  fiscal year 2000; simplifies  the definition of  issues under Sea Granf s authority; clarifies  the responsibilities of State and national pro grams; consolidates and clarifies the require ments for the designation of Sea Grant col leges and regional consortia; repeals the post doctoral fellowship and international programs,  both of which have never been  funded; and  makes several minor clerical or conforming  amendments.  I would like to acknowledge three of my dis tinguished colleagues-OoN YOUNG of Alaska,  NEIL ABERCROMBIE of Hawaii, and SAM FARR  of California-for their leadership in this reau thorization effort. We  firmly believe  that this  legislation  represents a realistic approach  to  reauthorizing the Sea Grant Program-the bill  is  inherently noncontroversial and has been  fully endorsed by the administration. By enact ing this legislation, we send a clear message  supporting the protection and wise use of our  marine and coastal resources.

24,,105,-0.416,378,1,Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts.," Mr. Speaker,  today Mr. Thomas and  I are  introducing the  Super IRA bill. This bill is comprehensive indi vidual retirement account [IRA] legislation. The  main purpose of this legislation  is to make it  easier for individuals to save for retirement.  Saving for retirement is an issue which we  must address. The Super IRA legislation will  help with retirement and we can do this in a  bipartisan manner. The phase ""economic se curity"" has become part of our vocabulary.  During this session of Congress, we should do  as much as possible to make individuals more  secure in their retirement.  Statistics about retirement and our savings  are not promising. Chairman Alan Greenspan  of the Federal Reserve once stated that our  is our No. 1 eco low national savings rate  nomic problem. Our national savings  rate  is  only 1 percent of GDP.  We are beginning  to  face what has been  commonly referred to as the ""graying of Amer ica."" Within 30 years 1 out of every 5 Ameri cans will be over 65.  In 15 years,  the baby  boomers will  begin  turning  65. The baby  boomers generation consists of 76 million peo ple and this will result in Social Security bene ficiaries doubling by the year 2040. Less than  half of American workers are covered by pri vate sector pensions.  The Super  IRA  legislation provides  incen tives for individuals to save for their own re tirement. This legislation makes it easier for in dividuals to become personally responsible for  their retirement. It will make all Americans eli gible  for  fully deductible  IRA's by  the year  ",1997

I should add that a number  of Members in this body who have ex amined the agreement also share this  view.  The  base  agreement,  coupled  with the many loopholes and special  concessions granted to foreign govern ments, would continue  to place U.S.  shipbuilders at a tremendous competi tive disadvantage.

30,Senate,105,-0.308,755,1,Mr. FEINGOLD.," Mr. President, I am  today  introducing  legislation  termi nating the Uniformed Services Univer sity of the Health Sciences [USUHS], a  medical school run by the Department  of Defense. The measure is one I pro posed when I ran for the U.S. Senate,  and was part of a larger, 82 point plan  to reduce  the Federal budget deficit.  The Congressional Budget Office [CBO]  estimates that terminating the school  would save $369 million over the next  six years.  USUHS was created in 1972 to meet  an expected shortage of military med ical personnel. Today, however, USUHS  accounts for only a small fraction of  the military's new  physicians,  less  than 12 percent in 1994 according  to  CBO. This contrasts dramatically with  the mili tary's  scholarship  program  which provided over 80 percent of the  military's new physicians in that year.  Mr. President, what  is even more  troubling is that USUHS  is also  the  single most costly source of new physi cians  for  the military. CBO  reports  that based on figures from 1995, USUHS  trained physicians cost  the military  $615,000 per person. By comparison, the  scholarship program cost about $125,000  per person, with other sources pro viding new physicians at a  cost of  $60,000. As CBO noted in their Spending  and Revenue Options publication, even  adjusting  for  the  lengthier  service  commitment  required  of  USUHS  trained physicians, the cost of training  them is still higher than that of train ing physicians from other sources, an  assessment  shared by  the Pentagon  itself.  Indeed, CBO's estimate of the  savings generated by this measure also  includes  the cost of obtaining physi cians from other sources.  The other body has voted to termi nate this program on several occasions,  and the Vice President's National Per formance Review  joined others, rang ing from the Grace Commission to the  CBO, in raising the question of whether  this medical school, which graduated  its first class in 1980, should be closed  because it is so much more costly than  alternative sources of physicians  for  the military.  Mr. President. the real issue we must  address is whether USUHS is essential  to the needs of today's military struc ture, or if we can do without this cost ly program. The proponents of USUHS  frequently  cite  the higher  retention  rates of USUHS graduates over phys~­ cians obtained from other sources as a  justification for continuation of this  program, but while a greater percent age of USUHS trained physicians may  remain  in  the military  longer  than  those from other sources, the Pentagon  indicates that the alternative sources  already provide an appropriate mix of  retention rates. Testimony by the De partment of Defense before  the Sub committee on Force Requirements and  Personnel noted  that  the military's  scholarship program meets the reten tion needs of the services.  And while USUHS only provides a  small fraction of the military's new  physicians, it is important to note that  relying  primarily  on  these  other  sources has not compromised the abil ity of military physicians to meet the  needs of the Pentagon. According  to  the Office of Management and Budget,  of the approximately 2,000 physicians  serving  in Desert Storm,  only  103,  about 5 percent, were USUHS trained.  Mr. President,  let me conclude by  recognizing  that USUHS  has  some  dedicated supporters in the U.S. Sen ate, and I realize that there are legiti mate arguments that those supporters  have made in defense of this institu tion. The problem, however, is that the  federal government can no  longer afthat  ford  to continue every program  provides some useful function.  In the face of our staggering national  debt  and  annual  deficits, we must  prioritize and eliminate programs that  can no longer be sustained with limited  Federal dollars, or where a more cost effective means of fulfilling those func tions can be substituted. The future of  USUHS continues to be debated pre cisely because in these times of budget  restraint it does not appear to pass the  higher threshold tests which must be  applied  to all Federal spending pro grams.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the legislation be  printed in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  s. 37  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTEES LEGISLATION  ",1997
31,Senate,105,0.631,768,1,Mr. HELMS.," Mr. President, there's a  significant question about  the use of  the American taxpayers' money.  Should State and local health depart ments,  hospitals,  and  other  family  planning organizations  funded under  title X of the Public Health Service  Act, be  specifically allowed  to off er  adoption services to pregnant women?  The answer, Mr. President, is: Abso lutely.  And Congress  should be unmistak ably clear in expressing our judgment  that public and private health facili ties can and should offer adoption serv ices.  The vast majority of the American  people agree. Many polls have shown  that people approve of their tax dollars  being used by clinics to promote and  encourage adoptions instead of the hei nous destruction of unborn children.  Statistics emphasize the merit of the  proposal that clinics and agencies re ceiving title X funding should explic itly be authorized  to offer adoption  services.  The National Council  for  Adoption asserts that an estimated 2  million  couples  are  today hopefully  and prayerfully waiting  to  adopt  a  l,  child. Yet, 1.5 million babies are re fused the right to live every year.  Mr. President,  if every abortion in  this country could be prevented  this  year there would still be 500,000 couples  ready and waiting to adopt children.  Small wonder that adoption is called  ""the loving option.""  But it is even more tragic, Mr. Presi dent,  that women with unplanned or  unwanted pregnancies are unaware of  the wonderful opportunities available  to their child through adoption. These  women, states Jeff Rosenberg, formerly  of the National Council for Adoption,  ""are not hearing about adoption, and  thus [are] not considering it as a possi bility. Young pregnant women are fre quently not told by counselors and so cial workers that adoption is an alter native.""  With this in mind, I offer today the  Federal Adoption Services Act of 1997,  a bill that proposes to amend title X of  the Public Health Services Act to per mit federally-funded planning services  to provide adoption services based on  two  factors: No.  the needs of the  community in which the clinic is lo cated, and No. 2, the ability of an indi vidual clinic to provide such services.  Mr. President,  those  familiar with  the many Senate debates of the past  regarding title X will recall the exces sive  emphasis placed on  preventing  and/or spacing of pregnancies, and lim iting the size of the American family.  I hope that this year, we can refocus  this debate, emphasizing the need  to  affirm life rather than preventing or  terminating it.  Sure, the radical feminists and other  pro-abortionists  will  voice  their  hysterical objections. So before  they  raise  their voices,  let's make clear  what this legislation will not do. For  example:  No woman will be threatened or ca joled into giving up her child for adop tion. Family planning clinics will not  be required to provide adoption serv ices. Rather, this legislation will make  it clear that Federal policy will allow,  or even encourage adoption as a means  of family planning.

32,Senate,105,-0.374,781,1,Mr. LEAHY.," Mr. President,  I  join  today in introducing  the Curt Flood  Act of 1997. Like the earlier version of  this legislation that I sponsored in the  last Congress,  this bill is intended to  cut back on the unjustified, judicially  created exemption from  the antitrust  laws. In my view no one is or should be  above the law.  Last Congress for the first  time in  our history, the Senate Judiciary Com mittee favorably reported language de signed to cut back baseball's judicially  mandated and aberrational antitrust  exemption. We did so with the support  of the Clinton administration and a bi partisan coalition of Senators. This bill  reflects that language.  The Senate refused to consider the  measure over the last 2 years. In part  that may be explained by the opposi-: ti on from major league baseball team  owners and perhaps by a feeling among  some that we should not legislate dur ing a time in which there was a labor management impasse. Both those con cerns have now been removed with the  recent, 5-year agreement between the  major league baseball team owners and  the Major League Baseball Players As sociation. Indeed, a provision in that  agreement calls for the owners to lobby  Congress in support of the repeal of the  antitrust exemption, at least to the ex tent it relates to labor-management re lations.  It is time to build on the progress we  made last year and long past time for  the Senate to act. Congress may not be  able  to solve every problem or heal  baseball's self-inflicted wounds, but we  can do  this: We can pass  legislation  that will  declare  that  professional  baseball can no longer operate above  the law.  Our antitrust laws protect competi tion and benefit consumers. We  are  faced with  an  anomalous  situation  where the Federal antitrust laws have  not applied  to certain major  league  baseball functions and operations for  over 70 years.  I hope that we will, at long last, take  up the issue of major leagues baseball's  antitrust  exemption. The  burden  of  proof is on those who seek to justify  this exemption from the law. No other  business or professional or amateur  sport  is possessed of  the exemption  from  law that major  league baseball  has enjoyed and abused.  One of the players who  testified at  our hearings  last Congress  asked a  most perceptive question:  If baseball  were coming to Congress today to ask  us to provide a statutory exemption,  would such a bill be passed? I believe  the answer to  that question is a  re sounding no.  In addition, there is and has been no  independent commissioner who could  look out for the best interests of base ball and its fans. Despite repeated as surances, there has been no action to  restore a strong, independent commis sioner to oversee the game aild it has  suffered  the consequences. It is only  now beginning to emerge from a 4-year  struggle without a  labor-management  agreement. I see that the owners last  week authorized their executive com mittee to begin a search for a new com missioner. In my view baseball would  be well  served by making a  serious  commitment to a strong, independent  commissioner. Neither fans nor Con gress will be inspired by delay, drift or  lack of direction.  In Vermont when I was growing up  virtually everyone was a Red Sox fan.  Now  loyalties are split among teams  and among various sports. We have a  successful minor  league  team,  the  Vermont Expos, the champions of the  New York-Penn League last season. We  also have businesses and jobs that de pend on baseball and fans who have  been hurt by its shortsightedness and  mismanagement over the past several  years. There is a strong public interest  in  baseball  and  it  reverberates  throughout the country.  I am concerned about the interests of  the public and, in particular, the inter ests of baseball fans. To reiterate the  words of baseball's last commissioner,  Fay Vincent: ""Baseball is more  than  ownership  of  an  ordinary  business.  Owners have a duty to take into con sideration  that  they own  a part of  America's national pastime-in trust.  This trust sometimes requires putting  self-interest  second."" Baseball's fans  feel that this trust had been violated  over the last several years.  It is the public that is being short changed by the policies and practices  of major league baseball and by dis regard for the interests of the fans. I  look forward to moving ahead thought fully to reconsider major league base ball's exemption  from  legal  require ments  to which all other businesses  must conform their behavior. Since the  multi-billion  dollar  businesses  that  have grown from what was once our na tional pastime are now being run ac cordingly to a financial bottom line, a  healthy injection of competition may  be just what is needed.  ",1997
33,Senate,105,-0.45,846,1,Mrs. BOXER.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today to introduce the Domestic Vio lence Identification and Referral Act.  Spousal abuse, child abuse, and elder  abuse  injures millions of Americans  each year, and is growing at an alarm ing rate. An estimated 2 to 4 million  women are beaten by their spouses or  former spouses each year. In 1993, 2.9  million children were reported abused  or neglected, about triple the number  reported in 1980. Studies also showed  that spouse abuse and child abuse often  go hand-in-hand.  Doctors,  nurses,  and other health  care professionals are on the front lines  of  this abuse, but  they cannot stop  what they have been trained to see or  talk  about. The Domestic Violence  Identification  and Referral Act  ad dresses this need by encouraging med ical schools to incorporate training on  domestic violence  into  their curricu lums.  There is a need for this legislation.  While many medical specialities, hos pitals,  and other organizations have  made  education about domestic vio lence a priority, this instruction typically occurs on the job or as part of a  continuing medical education program.  A 1994  survey by  the Association of  American Medical Colleges  [AAMC]  found that 60 percent of medical school  graduates rated the time devoted to in struction in domestic violence as inad equate.  The  bill  I  am  introducing  today  would give preference in Federal fund ing to those medical and other health  professional schools which provide sig nificant training in domestic violence.  It defines significant  training  to  in clude  identifying victims of domestic  violence  and maintaining  complete  medical records, providing medical ad vice regarding  the dynamics and na ture of domestic violence, and referring  victims to appropriate public and non profit entities for assistance.  The bill also defines domestic vio lence in the broadest terms, to include  battering, child abuse and elder abuse.  I hope my colleagues agree that this  legislation is a critical next step in the  fight to bring the brutality of domestic  violence out in the open. It mobilizes  our Nation's health care providers to  recognize and  treat  its victims-and  will ultimately save lives by helping to  break the cycle of violence.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous con sent that the text of the bill be printed  in the RECORD.  There being no objection, the bill was  ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as  follows:  S.101  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives of the United States of America in  Congress assembled,  SECTION 1.

34,Senate,105,-0.319,859,1,Mr. INOUYE.," Mr. President, I rise to  introduce  legislation  to  restore  the  business meals and entertainment tax  deduction to 80 percent. I am joined by  Senators THOMAS, COCHRAN' AND STE VENS. Restoration of this deduction is  essential to the livelihood of the food  service, travel and tourism, and enter tainment  industries  throughout  the  United States. These  industries  are  being economically harmed as a result  of this reduction. All are major indus tries which employ millions of people.  many of whom are already feeling the  effects of the reduction.  The deduction for business meals and  entertainment was reduced from 80 to  50 percent under the Omnibus budget  Reconciliation Act of 1993, and went  into effect on January 1, 1994. Many  companies,  small  and  large,  have  changed their policies and guidelines  on travel and entertainment expenses  as a result of the tax reduction in the  business meals and entertainment ex penses deduction. Businesses have also  been forced to curtail company reim bursement policies because of the re duction in the business meals and en tertainment  expenses  deduction.  some cases, businesses have eliminated  their expense accounts. Consequently,  restaurant establishments, which have  replied heavily on business lunch and  dinner services, are being adversely af fected by  the  reduction  in business  meals. For example:  Jay's Restaurant  in Dayton, Ohio,  closed its lunch service on July 14, 1994,  following a 15 percent decrease in lunch  business. This decision was based on  2,000 fewer lunch customers from Janu ary through June 1994 as compared to  the same period in 1993.  The Wall Street Restaurant in Des  Moines,  Iowa,  an upscale  restaurant  serving American and Continental cui sine, has seen its revenues decline 40  percent since  the beginning of 1994.  Owner Joey Fasano reduced his staff  from 50 to 35 employees.  The Boca in Middlesex County, New  Jersey, averaged 40  to 60  lunches per  day prior to 1994. The restaurant now  serves between 5 to 15 lunches per day.  Owner Robert Campione  reduced his  staff from 18 to 14 employees.  The 37th Street Hideaway Restaurant  in New York City did 150 lunches a day  prior to 1994. Owner Van Panopoulos  now serves 40  lunches and his dinner  business has dropped 30  to 40 percent.  Mr. Panopoulos reduced his staff from  20 to 10 employees.  Bianco's in Denver, Colorado, closed  its lunch service in April 1994 because  of the decline in business. Owner Fred  White reduced his staff from 26  to 15  employees.  In  ",1997

Mr. President, I would like to thank  the  distinguished  chairman  for  his  comments and also for the speed with  which he processed this nomination. I  think it is very important and signifi cant that he has done that, and it cer tainly speaks for the best interests of  bipartisanship.  Mr. President. as the only woman on  the Foreign Relations Committee.  I  consider this to be a historic appoint ment indeed. I rise to say that I am  proud to indicate my very enthusiastic  support for Madeleine Albright to be  confirmed  before  this  body  as Sec retary of State.  I want to commend President Clinton  . because he was certainly faced with an  array of very qualified candidates. But  I think he chose one of the very, very  best. Anyone who heard her thoughtful  responses  to  some 6 hours of ques tioning during her confirmation hear ing would have been impressed by her  knowledge, her eloquence and her skill.  I fully expect Ambassador Albright to  be a truly superb Secretary of State.  I look forward to working with her as  various foreign policy issues come be fore the Senate of the United States. It  is difficult  to  imagine a background  and a body of experience better suited  to the person we call on to be our Na tion's chief diplomat and  the Presi dent's chief  foreign  policy  advisor.  Madeleine Albright  knows  firsthand  the ""streets"" of foreign policy, how ac tions by governments affect the lives of  individuals. Her  enormous  intellect,  her  personal  experience,  her  plain  speaking, I think, will be huge assets.  As the United States approaches the  21st century, I believe it is crucial that  our foreign policy be conducted in a bi partisan manner. The practice of rein venting  the wheel  of  foreign  policy  every 4 years or at least with every  change of administration has been dif ficult on our allies and weakens Amer ican credibility as the strongest nation  on Earth.  Madeleine Albright holds a  unique  opportunity to cement a bipartisan for eign policy. If she can accomplish this,  her legacy to this Nation and the world  will be  significant. One of the most  complex issues that she will face, and  the largest single area that I believe  needs focused attention, is the entire  Pacific rim. With 60 percent of the peo ple of  the world now  living on  the  shores of  the Pacific and American  trade with  the Pacific  rim  nations  three times that of the Atlantic,  the  administration's No. 1 priority in for eign policy should be  to maintain a  strong and positive presence in Asia.  As part of  this effort,  the United  States must build our most important,  but still largely undeveloped, bilateral  relationship-that with  the  People's  Republic of Chinar--into one of partner ship and cooperation in our many areas  of mutual interest.  Ambassador Albright's qualifications  to be Secretary of State are unim peachable. For the past 4 years she has  served with distinction as the U.S. Per manent Representative  to  the United  Nations, a member of the President's  Cabinet, and a member of the staff of  the National Security Council.  She has also headed one of Washing ton's foremost think tanks, served as  professor of  international  affairs at  Georgetown University's School of For eign Service, and holds a  doctorate  from  Columbia University.  And,  I  might add, she served as a staff mem ber for one of the true giants of the  U.S. Senate, Edmund Muskie, who him self went on to serve as Secretary of  State.  I  The  Beyond her professional accomplish ments, her  life-having  fled Czecho slovakia at  the dawn of  the Second  World War-provides a  lesson  in  the  values that we as Americans hold most  dear and for the role in the world that  America, at its best, can play.  As the first woman to serve as Sec retary of State, Madeleine Albright's  nomination will open up new doors for  all women, not just in this country, but  around  the globe,  in places unaccus tomed to seeing women in high office.  Whenever a woman crosses a threshold  into an area that has been predomi nantly held by men, and performs ef fectively, the doors open for women ev erywhere.  I take particular pride in casting my  vote  for  Ambassador  Madeleine  Albright. It is a  tremendous step for ward in our country for a woman to be  named the Nation's top diplomat. As  consequential as that is, in Madeleine  Albright's case it is really a secondary  consideration, because she  is so emi nently qualified for the job.  Al though I am sure it is unnecessary  to do so, I take pride in urging all of  my  colleagues  to  support  this  out standing nomination.  thank the Chair.

44,Senate,105,0.375,1015,1,Mr. COATS.," Madam President. I, too,  join in sending my congratulations to  our new Secretary  of Defense. Bill  Cohen, someone with whom I have had  the privilege of serving on the Senate  Armed Services Committee now for the  past 8 years.  Bill has been a most articulate and  most thoughtful member of that com mittee--obviously, someone whom we  have all come  to respect, someone of  great intellect and experience, arriving  at the House in 1973 and spending a sig nificant part of his lifetime serving the  people of Maine and serving the people  of this country.  He is known as a writer. I think he  has published eight books, and so  it  was al ways interesting to listen to his  statements in the Chamber. They were  always well-reasoned. They were  al ways well-researched. They were  al ways  thoughtful.  They  were  chal lenging and provocative. Bill had an  independent streak which was a great  asset. It allowed him to escape the or thodoxy of  the political mantra we  sometimes  find  ourselves  repeating  without a great deal of forethought.  Yet Bill's  challenge,  I  think,  raised  issues that we needed to discuss and  needed to consider. While I did not al ways come to the same conclusion he  did, I always respected his thoughtful ness and respect for the conclusions he  reached.  He now assumes a very difficult as signment. These are not easy times at  the Department of Defense, not be cause we find ourselves engaged in any  major conflict but because, for a period  of more than a decade, we have been  undertaking a very significant reorga nization following  the demise of the  cold war and following our success in  the  gulf. This  is not without  con sequence, and we are now approaching,  I believe, our 12th or 13th consecutive  year of reductions in defense spending.  That has taken its toll. It has placed  us  in a very difficult position. Sec retary-designate Cohen this morning in  testimony before  the Armed Services  Committee talked about the world as it  is  today, the challenges that exist in  that world,  the  threats that we still  face, albeit in a different form, and the  need to be militarily prepared and to  have a strong national security.  We are undertaking a quadrennial re view process which is going to force us,  as Secretary Cohen said, to make and  face some very difficult choices. The  declining budget has not allowed us to  maintain  the kind of capability that  many of us feel is necessary if we are  going  to  pursue  a  two-regional-re sponse strategy. We face some serious  questions  regarding  modernization,  balancing that with the need for readi ness and  the need for adequate com pensation for our personnel and ade quate benefits  for our personnel, as  well as the research and development  needed  to take us into the next cen tury.  All of these difficult choices will now  fall  to our new Secretary of Defense.  He is clearly someone with whom both  Republicans and Democrats can work.  In fact, we have worked together prob ably in a more bipartisan way on the  Armed Services Committee  than any  other committee in the Senate. And so  we stand ready to work with him in at tempting to address some of these fun damental questions that are going to  [Mr. GLENN],  determine the course of our defense in  future years.  I asked Bill Cohen this morning what  experiences in his life and particularly  during his  tenure  in Congress helped  shape his views in terms of the role of  the military and the role of defense. He  shared with us a response which I had  hoped he would give and was pleased  that he did give in outlining some of  the experiences he has had in traveling  to and visiting with and being with our  troops as they serve around the world.  We are often criticized here for some  of the travel that we take. I note the  Senator from Ohio  is in  the Chamber. I will never forget-and  it has been a basis of some of the crit ical decisions I have had to make re garding defense expenditures and de fense policy-the trip we  took to Ku wait right after the war and watching  Senator GLENN interact with marines  and naval personnel and military per sonnel and they react with him. Sen ator MCCAIN was with us. There is no  substitute for  leaving the charts and  leaving the Vu-Graphs and leaving the  cold facts on a piece of paper and get ting out in the field and talking to sol diers, whether it is generals or captains  or privates or sergeants.  There  is no substitute for  learning  some of the difficulties that take place,  in terms of putting  together an ade quate defense. some of the challenges  that face our country and face  those  personnel. There  is no substitute for  dealing with that on a personal basis.  Senator Cohen shared  that view and  shared  the view  that, when you do  that, when you personalize our deci sions, when you realize that someone's  son or daughter is going to be put at  risk in defense of this country, it gives  you a different perspective in terms of  the kind of equipment,  the kind of  quality of life, the kind of support for  their family, the kind of training and,  frankly, the kind of decisions we make  in terms of their deployment. I think it  is important for every Member to have  that perspective.  I have taken advantage of the oppor tunity as a member of the Armed Serv ices Committee to travel as much as  the schedule will allow and spend as  much time with our troops in the field  as time allows. It has been just an in valuable experience.  I  know Senator  Cohen will place those experiences at  the forefront of his thinking, in terms  of the decisions he has to make in the  Department of Defense.  I also congratulate Secretary Perry  for just an outstanding tenure as Sec retary of Defense. I was one of the peo ple who raised the question early on as  to whether Secretary Perry, while I ac knowledged  his  masterful  techno logical skills and management skills,  whether he could be an effective Sec retary of Defense in a political world,  trying to deal with all of us and the  give and take that takes place, because  ",1997
45,Senate,105,-0.328,1028,1,Mr. DODD.," Mr. President, we do a  great deal of important business here  in  the U.S. Senate, but much of it  seems arcane and distant  from  the  lives of American  families. But  last  evening, with the airing of a CBS made  for TV movie, ""A Child's Wish,"" we had  a particularly moving example of the  power we have to make a positive dif ference in the lives of America's fami lies. I don't know how many of my col leagues had a chance to see it. It was a  fictional story based on the true  life  experiences of two  families  impacted  by the Family and Medical Leave Act  signed into law by President Clinton in  1993.  Dixie Yandle was one of those chil dren.  I believe she came from North  Carolina, I say to my colleague from  North Carolina. Dixie's father lost his  job during her struggle with cancer as  he sought to spend more time with her.  She and her parents testified in fact be fore  the Congress about the need for  family medical  leave  legislation  so  that what happened to them would not  happen to the other parents.  The  second child, Melissa Weaver,  was also diagnosed with cancer that ul timately proved to be fatal. But due to  the Family and Leave Act the family  was able to spend the last days of her  life together. Melissa's story is one of  many that I heard in 1994 during a se ries of public hearings of the Commis sion on Family and Medical Leave on  the impact of the Family and Medical  Leave Act.  ""A Child's Wish""  took  the  lives of  these two children and wove them to gether to dramatize how important the  Family and Medical Leave Act is and  how meaningful it is to families. I am  hopeful  that  this movie may have  helped a  lot of people understand the  legislation better.  Today, at a time when many Ameri cans  are deeply  cynical  toward  the  work we do here  in Washington,  the  family and medical  leave  stands  in  sharp contrast.  Not only is this legislation making a  real difference in the lives of the Amer ican people. but it has been judged by  a bipartisan commission to be an un qualified success.  The Family and Medical Leave Act  fulfilled a genuine need among Amer ica's working families to take leave in  times of medical and family need.  With this legislation we established  in law a basic standard of decency to ward America's families.  Eligible employees were guaranteed  12 weeks of unpaid leave during times  of genuine family need-such as a birth  or  adoption,  placement  of a  foster  child, or in  times of serious medical  emergency for a child, spouse or par ent.  This minimal benefit-unpaid leave is providing millions of workers and  their  families with vital  assistance  during times of crisis.  Yet, even with the apparent success  of the FMLA there is still more work  to be done.  Millions of Americans  continue  to  face  painful  choices  involving  their  competing  responsibilities  to  family  and work.  Employees not covered by the Fam ily and Medical Leave Act are still  often  told that they must choose be tween sick family members and their  jobs.  In fact today, 43 percent of private  sector employees remain unprotected  by the Family and Medical Leave Act  because their employer does not meet  the  current  50  or more  employee  threshold.  This legislation I  introduce today the Family and Medical Leave Fairness  Act of 1997-will extend the Family and  Medical Leave Act to millions of Amer icans who remain uncovered.  This bill would lower the  threshold  to include coverage for companies with  25 or more workers.  This small step would provide 13 mil lion additional workers with the pro tection  of  the Family and Medical  Leave Act-raising the total percent age of the private sector work force  covered by the FMLA to 71 percent.  In my view,  these workers deserve  the same job security in times of fam ily and medical emergency that work ers  in larger companies receive from  the Family and Medical Leave Act.  With  this  legislation  they will  ceive it.  Now, for those of my colleagues who  still harbor doubts about the success of  the Family and Medical Leave Act I  strongly urge  them to examine a re cent bipartisan report that documents  the positive impact of this legislation.  When the bill was passed in 1993, pro visions in the legislation established a  commission to examine the impact of  the act on workers and businesses.  The Family and Medical Leave Com mission's analysis spanned 2112 years.  It included independent research and  field hearings across  the country  to  learn first hand about the act's impact  from individuals and the business com munity.  The report's conclusions are clear the Family and Medical Leave Act is  re helping  to  expand  opportunities  for  working Americans while at the same  time not placing any undue burden on  employers.  According to the Commission's final  report, the Family and Medical Leave  Act represents ""A significant step in  helping a larger cross-section of work ing Americans meet their medical and  family care giving needs while  still  maintaining their  jobs and economic  security.''  Due  to  this  legislation, Americans  now possess greater opportunities  to  keep  their health benefits, maintain  job security, and take longer leaves for  a greater number of reasons.  In fact, according to the bipartisan  commission-12 million workers  took  job-protected leave for reasons covered  by the Family and Medical Leave Act  during the 18 months of its study.  But, not only are American workers  reaping the benefits. The law is work ing for American business as well. In  fact, the conclusions of the bipartisan  report are a far cry from the concerns  that were voiced when  this  law was  being considered in Congress.  The vast majority of businesses over 94 percent-report little to no ad ditional costs associated with the Fam ily and Medical Leave Act.  More than 92 percent reported no no ticeable effect on profitability.  And nearly 96 percent reported no no-.  ticeable effect on business growth.  Additionally, 83 percent of employers  reported no noticeable impact on em ployee productivity.  In fact, 12.6 percent actually reported  a positive effect on employee produc tivity from  the Family and Medical  Leave Act, twice as many as reported a  negative effect.  And not only did employers report  that compliance with the Family and  Medical Leave Act was relatively easy  and of minimal cost, but worksites  with a small number of employees gen erally reported greater ease of adminis tration and even smaller costs  than  large worksites.  Today,  I  introduce  this  legislation  with the hope and expectation that we  can put aside our political differences  and build on the success of the Family  and Medical Leave Act. Last Novem ber,  the American people gave us a  mandate-a mandate for good govern ance.  The Family and Medical Leave rep resents the fulfillment of this goal and  I urge all my colleagues to join with  me in supporting this critically impor tant legislation for America's working  families.  I think the fact that the law has been  working so well has made a sufficient  difference in people's lives in moments  of crises. The fact that people are able  to be there particularly when a child is  dying, so that you have the love of par ents and a family coming together and  you don't have to choose between that  ",1997
46,Senate,105,-0.266,1041,1,Mr. BINGAMAN.," Mr. President. last  week my State and this country lost  an  extraordinary  man.  Clyde  Tombaugh, a retired New Mexico State  University professor, died on January  17 at the age of 90.  In 1930, at the age of 24,  this com pletely self-taught high  school grad uate was working at an observatory in  Arizona when he spotted something un usual in a photographic plate. Remark ably, his discovery turned out to be the  ninth planet, Pluto.  His discovery earned him a full schol arship to the University of Kansas to  study astronomy, and he went on to a  long  and  distinguished  career.  He  founded  the  research astronomy de partment of NMSU, and retired in 1973  and served as professor emeritus.  This ""remarkable man of science,"" as  one colleague described him, has left .a  truly great legacy.   TRIBUTE TO FATHER WILLIAM M.  MOBLEY. JR.   ",1997
47,Senate,105,-0.342,1041,1,Mrs. MURRAY.," Mr.  President,  I  stand today in recognition of an ex traordinary, colorful lifetime of service  and dedication by one individual who  strove to make a difference in his com munity.  Father William M. Mobley  was, in many respects, larger than life;  he was the type of person who several  centuries ago would have typified the  Renaissance man. He was a soldier, his torian, teacher, playwright, and actor.  But, in addition to his high intellect  and varied cultural  interests, Father  Mobley was a man grounded  in his  Catholic faith and dedicated to the ev eryday concerns of his parishioners.  He was known widely as Father Bill  in Mukilteo and nearby Everett, cities  just north of Seattle in my home State  of Washington.  It was here  that he  served St. John's Mission and St. Mary  Magdalene Church from 1987 until his  death this past Christmas Eve. Decem ber 24. 1996.  Father Mobley came  to  the priest hood, and his Catholic faith, late in his  life. Born on April 3, 1929, he was raised  in  Southern Baptist  roots  in Bir mingham, AL. He was first introduced  to Catholicism while an Air Force sol dier during the Korean war, and con verted in 1954. In 1956, Father Mobley  graduated  with  honors  from  Bir mingham-Southern College, where he  was widely acclaimed for his acting, di recting, and writing abilities  in  the  theater. Though he was offered a pres tigious scholarship to the Yale Drama  School, Father Mobley turned his at tention  to helping those around him.  Influenced by this desire to serve oth ers, Father Mobley joined Dr. Tom Bar ton. whom he had met while working  at a hospital in Pell City, AL. and trav eled to Green River. UT. From 1959 to  1970, Father Mobley assisted Dr. Bar ton in managing a badly needed med ical center that serviced residents of  Green River and east-central Utah.  In 1970, at  the  age  of 41, Father  Mobley entered the Pope John XXIII  National Seminary in Weston, MA. Un fortunately,  soon  thereafter,  Father  Mobley  suffered a heart attack,  the  first of three he would have in his life time, and had to have open-heart sur gery. While this would have been an in surmountable hurdle for a  lot of peo ple. Father Mobley rose above his phys ical pains and persevered to complete  his ordination in December 1973.  He then returned to Utah to serve in  the Diocese of Salt Lake City. While  there, Father Mobley touched innumer able  lives and hearts, participated in  charitable work,  and  ran  a  retreat  house in Logan, UT. But the strains of  his  physical  condition were  taking  their toll, and finally Father Mobley  was  forced  to move  from Salt Lake  City, where, due to its high altitude, he  was always accompanied by an oxygen  mask. A,lthough doctors advised retire ment, Father Mobley chose to serve in  the  Washington  Diocese  in  the  Mukilteo  and Everett  areas, whose  residents were  fortunate  enough  to  have been  touched by  this  extraor dinary person.  Today, I celebrate Father Mobley as  an active, energetic, and generous man.  He was generous with his faith sharing,  he was generous with his counsel, and  he was generous with his enthusiasm  and conversation. Father Mobley was a  man of incredible passion and compas sion. His friends,  family, and parish ioners will remember him for his soul ful sermons and championing of social  justice.  Father Mobley  challenged  those  around him to give and love uncondi tionally. This is a challenge each and  every one of us can take  inspiration  from. He was truly a man who loved his  fellow human beings, and he will be  missed by  those who had  the oppor tunity to know him.   TRIBUTE TO GOLD ST AR MOTHERS   ",1997
48,Senate,105,-0.267,1041,1,Mr. DORGAN.," Mr. President, as we  begin  a  new  session of Congress,  I  thought this would be an appropriate  time to stop for a moment and reflect  upon some of the sacrifices that have  been made by our citizens to ensure the  protection of liberty and democracy in  this great Nation. One group of citizens  comes immediately to mind-the Gold  Star Mothers.  This organization was formed in the  years following the end World War I. It  is  a  nonprofit,  nonpolitical  group  which was organized by 25 mothers in  June 1928 and incorporated on January  5, 1929. The cost of membership is in calculable. To join, one must have lost  a son or daughter during a war waged  by the United States.

51,Senate,105,-0.276,1119,1,Mr. REID.," Mr. President, the reason I  came to the floor today was not to talk  about the balanced budget amendment,  which I have been happy to do, but I  came here because I am going to intro duce  legislation  today  that will ex clud,e prison inmates from the protec tions of  the Relfgious Freedom Res toration Act.  Why would I want to do something  like that? Well, when this bill came to  the Senate floor approximately 2 years  ago,  I offered an amendment at that  time that said I want people's religious  freedoms restored but I  think we have  to be careful about prisoners and they  should not be part of this because they  are going to take advantage of it. Well,  they are taking advantage of it. One  prisoner in New York has filed 3,000  lawsuits.  What are these lawsuits about?  In Nebraska there was a lawsuit filed  an  inmate  thinks  he  is  a  because  woman  trapped in a man's body and  strip searches by male prison officials  are not allowed by his religion. Should  we take up the courts' time with this  type of litigation?  We have another case where a satanic  grou~they are in prison, of course filed suit because they were not given  unbaptized baby fat for their candles.  About 40 percent of the courts' time,  the Federal courts' time in Nevada is  taken up with this kind of stuff.  In Nevada we have an inmate suing a  chaplain for refusing to conduct a mar riage ceremony for  this man and his  male  friend.  The  plaintiff  and  his  friend are both members of the Uni versal Life Church which he claims al lows  two people of the same sex  to  marry.  In Nevada  inmates allege  their in ability to practice a religion is being  denied in violation of the first amend ment because they want special serv ices, including incense and special jew elry.  I  Mr. President,  this  is serious busi ness that the prisoners have made a  mockery of. My amendment  should  have  passed when  offered  it. We  should make sure that this nonsense is  stopped. There are protections in my  legislation. If someone is being denied  their  religious  practices,  certainly  there are protections there. But protec tions of the Religious Freedom Res toration Act would be  denied  these  prisoners, and I believe rightfully so.  As I indicated, I addressed this prob lem several years go. The problem is  inmates abuse the special protections  provided under the Religious Freedom  Restoration Act. During consideration  of this bill in 1993 or 1994, I offered an  amendment to exempt prisoners from  the coverage of this act as I have indi cated.  I did so  then because I  feared  these  special  protections would  be  abused by  inmates. They have been  abused by inmates. Whatever I said on  the Senate floor was not enough, be cause they have even outdone my ex pectations.  say,  regrettably,  I wish  I would  have been wrong. I wish that I had been  wrong and that these  inmates would  not have abused  the  legislation that  did pass. But it is apparent now that  inmates are in fact abusing the special  rights under this act.  I have worked with the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, my  friend  from the State of Utah, to address the  larger problem  of  frivolous prisoner  lawsuits, and we were able to accom plish something last year, maybe not  enough. We may even need to revisit  that to find out if we were able to plug  all the holes with the Prisoner Li tiga tion Reform Act.  I believe we need to do more to curb  the ongoing abuses occurring under the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act de spite  the Prisoner Litigation Reform  Act.  I  I  Today  I  am  introducing  this  bill  which will prohibit the application of  the Religious Freedom Restoration Act  to inmates in a Federal, State, or local  penal facility.  in tend to meet with  the Attorney General of  the United  States  so  that  she  appreciates  the  growing litigation that they face in the  area. Criminals should not enjoy the  same rights and privileges as law-abid ing citizens. The sad commentary in  our present system, Mr. President, is  they enjoy more rights than many peo ple who are outside prisons.  We need not go through the litany of  cable television, gyms better than peo ple can buy membership in on the out side, libraries that are unsurpassed, ex ercise areas, food, three square meals a  day, nice clean clothes. They have a  pretty good deal. One of the deals I do  not think they should have is the abil ity  to  file  these  lawsuits with  an  unending array of ideas at the expense  of the taxpayers.  The Religious Freedom Restoration  Act sought to provide the legal protec tions supporting the right to freely ex ercise one's religious beliefs. Providing  inmates with these same rights, I said,  was a disaster and was a recipe for dis aster; and it has been proven to be an  understatement.  Our courts now have to spend their  time wading through lawsuits filed by  inmates that are ridiculous, for lack of  a better description. I have described  some of these lawsuits this morning. I  have described them in the past. I ask  my colleagues to join with me to take  this pressure off our court system and  off the taxpayers of this country. This  is wrong, what they are doing, and we  have the obligation to stop it.

Mr. President, today I  am introducing legislation to establish  an independent, nonpartisan Commis sion to eliminate corporate pork from  the Federal budget.  The nine-member Commission, called  the Corporate Subsidy Reform Com mission, would be charged with review ing all Federal subsidies to private in dustry,  including special interest tax  provisions.  The  Commission  would  identify those programs which are un necessary, unfair, or not in the clear  and  compelling public  interest,  and  recommend  them  to Congress for re form or  termination. Congress would  then be required to consider and vote  on a comprehensive corporate subsidy  ",1997
52,Senate,105,-0.435,1171,1,Mr. SARBANES.," I thank the Chair.  Mr. President, I  join my colleague,  the chairman of  the Banking Com mittee, Senator D'AMATO of New York,  in strong support of the nomination of  Andrew Cuomo as the next Secretary  of  the Department  of Housing  and  Urban Development.  In my judgment, Mr. Cuomo is well  qualified for this position. In addition  to  his  background,  experience,  and  record of significant achievement, An drew Cuomo will provide  the Depart ment with  stability  and  continuity  since he has been an Assistant Sec retary at the Department over the past  4 years.  As HUD's Assistant Secretary  for  Community  and  Planning Develop ment, Andrew Cuomo played a signifi cant role  in  this administration's ef forts to revitalize America's distressed  communities and a significant role in  their efforts to restructure the Depart ment itself. In that regard, outgoing  HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros-who I  think deserves the thanks of all of us  for the very stellar service he has given  to  the  Nation-made  significant  progress in addressing the management  difficulties that confronted the Depart ment at the beginning of his tenure.  Andrew Cuomo was part of that team,  and his familiarity with the way the  Department works  and  the  reforms  now  underway will  provide  for  a  smooth transition that will allow this  progress to move forward.  Mr. Cuomo's activities in the realm  of  housing  and  urban  development  prior to his joining the Department at  the beginning of the first Clinton ad ministration demonstrated the initia tive  and  innovation  that  he  has  brought with him to the Department.  He created HELP, a homeless assist ance organization that is now the Na tion's largest provider of transitional  housing for the homeless. He also de veloped the alternative approaches to  urban  revitalization  and  community  development that led to the founding  of the Genesis project, a program that  has created partnerships between State  and local governments and the private  sector to provide affordable housing.  Mr. Cuomo has put this past experi ence and the vision connected there with to work over the past 4 years as  HUD Assistant Secretary for Commu nity Planning and Development. His  achievements  during  this  period  in  that office were many. This morning, I  want  to  underscore  three  achieve ments, in particular, that indicate his  promise as he takes on the larger chal lenge of stewardship of the entire De partment of Housing and Urban Devel opment.  First,  I  want  to  commend Mr.  Cuomo 's administration of the HOME  Investment  Partnership  Program.  Chairman D'AMATO and former housing  subcommittee chairman, Senator Alan  Cranston, were very much involved in  establishing the HOME program. When  the Clinton administration arrived, the  relatively  new HOME  program was  moving slowly, seemingly mired in reg ulation. Mr. Cuomo took the initiative  in eliminating those regulations that  were  obstructing  the  program's  progress. He worked closely with State  and local governments and the private  sector-both for-profit and nonprofit to identify the features of the HOME  program that needed to change in order  to allow the program to function bet ter. The result of his hard work is the  effective housing program that HOME  has become today. State and local gov ernments, in conjunction with private  for-profit  and  private  not-for-profit  partners, are producing significant re sults using HOME funds for activities  ranging from housing rehabilitation to  home ownership assistance.  Mr. Cuomo has also earned praise for  his tireless work on behalf of the home less. After 4 years as Assistant Sec retary,  he  can  take  the  credit  for  changing  the way  that our Nation's  homeless programs are administered at  the  local  level. Under his  leadership  communities have  now  instituted a  continuum of care approach. The con tinuum of care is a phrase that Andrew  Cuomo coined for a comprehensive sys tem of assistance that provides preven tion,  outreach and  screening,  emer gency shelters,  transitional and sup portive housing, and permanent hous ing with  services  to  the  homeless  where needed. I have seen the effective ness of the service delivery that comes  with the local planning and coordina tion that are at the core of the con tinuum  of  care  approach.  Andrew  Cuomo has made these happen.  Third, Mr. Cuomo deserves recogni tion for his direction of the HUD pro grams that assist local economic devel opment. He has worked hard to make  the Community Development Block  Grant Program a more effective  tool  for  local communities pursuing new  economic development opportunities.  He has also expanded the section 108  loan guarantee program, greatly  im proving  that program's use by  local  government. And, he has served ably as  the principal Federal official charged  with  the  implementation of the Em powerment Zone and Enterprise Com munity Programs. All of these activi ties will become  increasingly  impor tant as the Nation struggles with its  commitment  to move  families  from  welfare to work.  Andrew Cuomo reiterated his com mitment to his role as HUD Secretary  in his statement before  the Banking  Committee last week, and I quote him:  Our goal must be to create a future unlike  any that has come befor~a future open to  all-in which no person is left behind and in  which no community is forgotten. A future  in which everyone willing to do his or her  part will be empowered with  the tools  to  reach as high a.s their talents a.nd hard work  will take them.  Mr. President, it is clear why Presi dent  Clinton  has  selected Andrew  Cuomo as the next Secretary of the De partment of Housing and Urban Devel opment. I urge my colleagues to join  with me in supporting this very fine  nomination.  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator  from Connecticut whatever  time he  may require.  ",1997

55,Senate,105,0.219,1236,1,Mr. STEVENS.," Mr. President, Alaska  lost one of its greatest 20th century  pioneers this month, when Robert B.  Atwood died on January 10.  Many  today remember him as  the  man who edited and published Alaska's  largest  newspaper,  the  Anchorage  Times, for more than 50 years.  But some of my best memories are of  the hours and days and weeks we spent  together  in  the 1950's, when he was  chairman  of  the Alaska  Statehood  Committee and I was assistant to the  Secretary of the Interior Fred Seaton  as Alaskans sought Statehood.  Bob Atwood was a  leader  in  that  fight. He  crystallized  the support of  our Nation's press to put the 49th star  on our flag. It was his understanding  and knowledge of the news media, and  his friendships among editors and pub lishers across our Nation that brought  the press on board,  to champion  the  cause  for  bringing Alaska  into  the  union. Not  too many years later, he  was responsible for newspapers across  our .Nation understanding  the  impor tance of building our great Alaska  pipeline.  Bob Atwood was more than a great  publisher, more  than  the  successful  chairman of the Statehood Committee.  He was a  cultural  renaissance man,  who did much behind the scenes to pro mote the arts and education in Alaska.  Bob  loved  new  technology,  and  brought his newspaper into the com puter age long before most of the Na tion's largest dailies were on line. He  was the first one on the staff of the An chorage Times to learn how to use the  new computers, while his staff strug gled with  the  transition  from  type writers to the electronic age.  His knowledge of history, and of the  many  seriousand humorous-stories  about Alaska and Alaskans who shaped  my State's history, was extraordinary.  Bob was generous in sharing those sto ries with organizations and groups who  asked him to speak or to attend their  meetings.  Above all, Bob Atwood understood  the  importance of a  strong military  presence in Alaska,  the crossroads of  the world, and he helped to make the  Nation aware of our strategic global  position.  He was a  tireless supporter of our  service men and women, and remained  friends with many of them long after  their  tours of duty  in Alaska were  over. For 40 years Bob served on the  military's civilian advisory boards in  Alaska, and was president since 1976 of  the Alaskan Command Civilian Advi sory Board. He assured that in Alaska  there was-and still is-a partnership  between our military stationed in our  State and Alaskans.  Immediately after  the  1964  earth quake, he  told me he wanted to buy  land and build a house close to the area  most damaged by  the earthquake,  to  show his confidence  in  the future of  Alaska. He built that house and opened  it up  time  and  again  to men and  women from our State and hundreds of  others he had met during his travels in  our country and all over the world.  My friend Bob was quietly generous  to a number of causes which were never  publicized. In addition, he was proud of  those which bear his name, to which he  donated millions of dollars,  including  the Atwood chair in journalism at the  University of Alaska, the Atwood Cen ter at Alaska Pacific University, and  the Evangeline Atwood Theater at An chorage's performing arts center. His  generosity touched the  lives of thou sands of Alaskans,  though  they may  never have known it.  Bob Atwood had the manners of an  old-fashioned gentleman, the curiosity  and sense of fun of a youngster, and  writing and editing talents that could  only be achieved through graceful ma turity and a great understanding and  love of words.  In helping to make life better for all  Alaskans, Bob Atwood made history.  He was indeed a great man, who helped  to make our great land even greater.  He was also a dear, good and  loyal  friend. I will miss him. Our sympathy  goes out to his daughter Elaine and his  grandsons and granddaughter, to whom  he was devoted.  As a visitor comes into my office,  there is a photo of Bob Atwood and me  with our snowmachines  in  the broad  fields near Alyeska, the ski resort in  my home town, Girdwood, AK. I cher ish those days when I spent time there  with Bob, with Evangeline and Elaine  Atwood.  Bob was a true Alaskan-a real pio neer.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  TRIBUTE TO MAJ. GEN. CONRAD F.  ''NICK'' NECRASON  ",1997
56,Senate,105,-0.37,1327,1,Ms. MIKULSKI.," Mr. President, I rise  in support of this sense-of-the-Senate  resolution and am pleased to be a co sponsor of the resolution with my dis tinguished colleague, Senator SNOWE of  Maine. Senator SNOWE has been an out standing advocate for many years on  the issue of women's health. This is yet  one more action on her part that shows  her deep commitment in this area.  Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the Senate resolution. I am pleased to tell  you that my colleagues in the Demo cratic caucus join with us on a bipar tisan basis and have endorsed this. All  six Democratic women have cospon sored  this legislation. Over 30 of the  men that we call the ""Galahads"" also  cosponsored this resolution.  What does this resolution call for? It  calls for three things that would pro tect women's health, particularly  in  the area of breast cancer. No. 1, it calls  for further research on the benefits of  mammograms for women in their for ties; No. 2, it urges the public to follow  screening guidelines issued by medical  groups which call for mammography  screenings in women between the ages  of 40 and 49; and it calls upon the Na tional Cancer Institute to again revisit  the guidelines  that  they  themselves  promulgated, also urging that women  who are between the ages of 40 and 49  seek mammograms.  We  already  have  clearly  on  the  record, and clear guidelines have estab lished, that women over 50 should get  an annual mammogram. It is clear that  often the older you get, the more likely  you are to get breast cancer. But there  is a particular group of women between  ages 40 and 49 who are particularly  prone  to breast cancer, and each day  we are learning more what that cat egory  is. Therefore, we  are  urging  through this sense-of-the-Senate reso lution that traditional guidelines urg ing annual or, at the very least, bian nual mammograms for women between  the ages of 40 and 49 be pursued.  I could not believe when an NIH advi sory panel decided that women in this  age group might not need mammo grams, and at the very best, they were  either  silent or  tepid  in  their  rec ommendations. They made  this deci sion because they felt  there was not  substantial evidence  that  this group  was at risk. This flies  in the face of  what we know through studies done at  the National  Institutes  of Health,  through extramural programs at our  great academic centers of excellence,  and  also  in worldwide  studies  of  women. The NIH panel should have rec ognized, also, the weight that their an nouncement carries. This panel abso lutely  confused  the  public,  scared  women, and gave permission to insur ance companies not to pay for a mam mogram for a woman between the ages  of 40 and 49.  Mr. President, we think this creates  public health  concern. Now, why  a  would we believe  that? First, women  often have been reluctant  to seek a  mammogram either out of fear or be cause they do not have the Federal re sources to do it. We have been working  on education to deal exactly with those  issues and even to  offer opportunities  for women to be able to have funding  for this. Also, we have been engaged in  an impressive and assertive effort  to  educate primary  care  physicians  in  urging women to get mammograms.  We have been dealing with the insur ance companies on the whole issue of  breast cancer. Now  some  companies  have that misguided approach of insist ing that women leave a hospital in less  than 48 hours after they have had a  mastectomy. Mr. President, we  say  enough is enough. We should take time  out, go back to our science, go back to  our research, go back to the National  Institutes of Health and ask them to  come up with  the  recommendations  that we need. We are urging them to do  that. Not only are we urging them to  do that, but the actual Director of the  National Cancer Institute, Dr. Richard  Klausner,  is also  recommending that  this advisory board go back and take  another look.  Senator SNOWE has talked about the  risk of cancer. We all know that any  woman can fall prey to breast cancer.  It does not matter how old she is or  what her income bracket is. We know  she needs  to be  screened. We  know  40,000 women die every year of breast  cancer. We know over 138,000 women  every year have some early signs of  breast cancer. What we are saying on  behalf of the women and the men who  support us, let us go back to our stand ards.  I am happy to have joined in this res olution because I know that mammo grams save lives. And if breast cancer  is detected early, the probability that a  woman will survive is greater than 90  percent. My position is simple: Stick to  science, go to the guidelines that were  properly promulgated, listen to doctors  and other health care providers work ing in this field.  Mr. President, for some time we have  been working in a bipartisan bicameral  basis on this. I remember back in the  House of Representatives when Senator  SNOWE and I introduced one of the first  Women's Health Equity Acts that we  called for activity in this area. We have  been working on that ever since, on a  bipartisan bicameral basis,  and not  only with the women taking the lead,  but with  the enthusiastic support of  the men in our body.  Thanks  to  the  . work  of Senators  SNOWE, MnruLSKI, and BOXER, and Rep resentative MORELLA  and others, we  have established the Office of Women's  Health at NIH. We made more money  for research available for diseases most  affecting women. We  ensured  that  women were included in the protocols  of medical  research, where  they had  I  I  I  been excluded not because of science  but because of gender. We worked to  expand the coverage for mammograms  under Medicare  and  even  provided  funds  for  low-income women  to get  mammograms. We  also have  led  the  fight  for mammogram quality stand ards, which we will be reintroducing as  it expires. We hope to do this together,  to show that when it comes to fighting  for women's health, we are there. We  want to make sure that each family is  able to ensure that breast cancer does  not strike them. We are going to do it  not only on a bipartisan basis, we are  going to do it on a nonpartisan basis.  thank Senator SNOWE  for  taking  the lead on this as she has done in so  many other areas. We are pleased on  our side of the aisle to also join with  her.  send  to  the desk  the list of the  Democratic cosponsors. I look forward  to voting for this bill and continuing  our  advocacy  on  this most  crucial  issue.  ",1997

For 2 weeks,  .like many Ameri cans, I was disturbed by the news that  the National Institutes of Health would  not recommend regular mammograms  for women in their forties.  Mr. President, we have to call this a  deadly and silent disease. The fact is,  cancer is the leading cause of death for  women between the ages of 40 to 55. Mr.  President,  this statistic itself should  dictate  that women  in  their  forties  should have regular mammograms. It  only makes common sense that they  should. My worry is that without the  National  Institutes of Health's rec ommendation, women will  be  lulled  ",1997

59,House,105,-0.454,1392,1,Mr. EVANS.," Mr. Speaker, on June 7, 1945,  Gen. George S. Patton, Jr., while eulogizing  our American World War  II dead,  reminded  our grieving Nation: ""It is foolish and wrong to  mourn the men who died. Rather we should  thank God that such men lived."" General Pat ton's words should support and sustain us  today as we remember our colleague, FRANK  TEJEDA. Rather  than mourning FRANK'S  too early death, let us thank God for his life-let  us thank God we had the opportunity, and the  privilege, to know and work with this extraor dinary man.  FRANK was a favorite in this House. A genu inely friendly, decent, kind, and quiet man, his  participation  in a hearing or meeting guaran teed civility and  tolerance. When he spoke,  others leaned in so they could hear his words.  I firmly believe that FRANK'S notable courtesy  and obvious concern and regard for the views  of others were the results of a life challenge- as a young man growing up in southside San  Antonio-as a highly decorated marine who  fought and was wounded  in  the  jungles of  Vietnam-as a student at three of our coun try's most highly respected centers of learning  and  intellectual challenge-the University of  California at Berkeley, Harvard, and Yale.  As a  fellow member of the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs, I know that FRANK'S thought ful,  informed comments and constructive par ticipation  were  highly  regarded.  He  was  amo~g the first to sound the alarm regarding  Persian Gulf war syndrome. He championed  improvements in  the Montgomery GI Bill. He  fought  to ensure  that  the many veterans  in  San Antonio were well cared for and that the  Audie Murphy VA Hospital in San Antonio pro vided only the finest health care.  I was also  privileged  to serve with FRANK on  the Com mittee on National Security where his faithful  and effective participation demonstrated his  commitment  to  the members of our Armed  Forces and a strong national defense.  All of us considered FRANK a good  friend  and colleague. Our admiration, however, grew  into a real sense of awe as we watched him  literally wage the battle of his lifetime-a fight  he carried on with enormous courage and dig nity. None of us will ever forget the Honorable  FRANK  TEJEDA-or  the  special  grace with  which he lived his life.  Our deepest sympathy goes to FRANK's be loved family, his loyal and devoted staff, and  the residents of the 28th Congressional Dis trict of Texas, whom FRANK  represented so  ably and with great diligence. Please know  that we in this House are anxious to help in  any way possible during  the coming difficult  months. Let us all  thank God for the  life of  FRANK TEJEDA.  ",1997

63,,105,-0.346,1431,1,Mrs. KENNELLY.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to introduce legislation to clarify that frequent  flier mileage is not taxable.  I believe that fre quent flier miles are not taxable under current  law. However, in light of the Internal Revenue  Service's position  in  technical advice memo randum 9547001 and despite  the  fact  that  technical advice memoranda only apply to a  given taxpayer and set of circumstances, I feel  a clarification is necessary.  The  technical advice memorandum would  require employers  that permit employees  to  use frequent flyer miles for personal trips to  report as income on workers' W-2 forms the  full cost of plane tickets that led to the accu mulation of the frequent flier miles. This simply  makes no sense.  This  is one of those areas where taxation  would  raise a myriad of questions for which  there is no single correct answer, such as ap propriate timing-would miles be taxed when  earned or when used; valuation-is a mile  earned  from a credit card equal  to a mile  earned by flying a particular airline-what is  the correct value of a ticket or a free upgrade  in  light of the fact that any given flight has a  myriad of service classes;  segregation-do  employees have to try and keep track of which  miles were earned for personal travel, which  miles were earned  for business  travel, and  which miles are earned  from using a credit  card, or using a particular long-distance car rier? Taxation of  frequent  flier miles would  only result in mindless complication and pa perwork of nightmarish proportions for millions  of Americans,  the airlines and  the  Internal  Revenue Service. And the Service should re alize this.  At a time when over 15 million Americans  are enrolled  in  frequent  flier programs and  suspicion  that the  Internal Revenue Code is  not fair and needlessly complex  is at an all  time high, it would be sheer folly for the Serv ice to move in this area. They have opened,  closed, and reopened several projects to ad dress the tax treatment of frequent flier miles  over the years, all to no avail.  I believe that frequent flier miles are not tax able under current law and should remain that  way. My bill would simply explicitly say that  frequent flier miles are not taxable. I urge my  colleagues' support.  A  POINT-OF-LIGHT  FOR  ALL  AMERICANS:  SHIRLEY  URSULA  GRABER  HON. MAJOR R. OWENS  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 4, 1997  ",1997
64,,105,-0.569,1431,1,Mr. OWENS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise to honor  the memory of Shirley Ursula Graber, an indi1429  vidual who was a committed fighter for racial  and gender equality, and social and economic  justice. As a social architect, community lead er,  teacher, and  trusted confidant, she har bored a great faith in people, believing that ev eryone was capable of growth. During her  journey in this world, Ms. Graber's unwavering  activism  influenced many-young and old-to  become catalysts of change. Ms. Shirley Ur sula Graber  is a great Point-of-Light whose  citizenship,  passion,  and  accomplishments  should be saluted as a source of inspiration  for all Americans.  From her college days to age 72 when she  succumbed to a grave illness, Shirley Graber's  principles were placed strategically into action.  She was copresident of Brooklyn NOW-Na tional Organization for Women-and executive  board member of Brooklyn OWL-Older Wom en's League. At Brooklyn NOW, she led just a  handful of dedicated women  to prevent  the  dissolution of the chapter in the early 1990's.  Consequently, the chapter was brought to new  heights of activism and political awareness,  and  is now 350 members strong with a solid  core of active advocates. At Brooklyn OWL,  Ms. Graber influenced the focus and success  of the 250-member chapter in its advocacy of  issues especially significant to women in their  golden years.  Shirley Graber always  recognized and at tacked any person, effort or idea that threat ened  the  social  condition  of women. She  spearheaded  the  formation  and  served as  Chair of the Coalition  to Save the Brooklyn  College Women's Center. This union of wom en's organizations in Brooklyn fought to save  the oldest women's center in New York State  that had been  threatened with extinction by  budget cuts.  Ms, Graber thoroughly appreciated the his torical  transformation of women's  rights  in  America. She was dedicated  to completing  this transformation and furthering such rights.  For example, Ms. Graber possessed a fervent  core belief  in  the need  for an equal  rights  amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In honor  of her ideas and endeavors, she received the  New York State NOW Woman  to Woman  Award. A plaque in her honor is also sched uled  for  installation  in  the Women's Hall of  Fame at Seneca Falls, NY-the birthplace of  the U.S. women's suffrage movement.  Shirley Graber was the daughter of a steel  mill  union  organizer and  a  strong-minded  mother, who in her 90's is still an outspoken  community and women's  rights advocate. A  resident of Brooklyn, NY, Ms. Graber was  born  in Cleveland, OH and moved  to New  York in 1948 to attend graduate school. She  first attended Ursuline College  in Ohio,  the  first member of her family to obtain a postsec ondary education.  As evidenced  in her life activities,  it is dif ficult to determine where Ms. Graber's profes sional,  civic, and personal  life began and  ended. The fervor and skill with which she car ried out her work as teacher, organizer, and  counselor were  inextricably connected to her  larger goals of equality and justice for all. Con sistently, she not only uplifted her community  and her gender, but she improved the quality  of life for everyone.

65,,105,0.29,1457,1,Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN.," Mr. Speaker, today  I introduced legislation along with Representa tive  MENENDEZ  to  encourage  America's  schools to teach our young students about a  tragic period  in history that nearly destroyed  the people and country of Ireland and forever  changed the face of America.  The mass starvation in Ireland from 1845 to  1850  initiated by  the dramatic  failure of the  Irish potato crop is most commonly referred to  as the Irish potato famine. Although Europe's  poorest country  in  the middle 19th century,  Ireland's 8 million  inhabitants were curiously  well nourished. The Irish people relied on the  potato for the bulk of their diet since it was in expensive and high in nutrients. However, in  1845, the Irish potato crop was ruined across  the  entire  countryside  by . phytophthora  infestans, an airborne pestilence. At the time,  no one knew what caused  the potato blight  and so little could be done to save the crops.  Across the whole of Ireland, potatoes simply  rotted on the ground.  The failure of the potato crop led to the in ability of most Irish families to pay the rent on  their cottages which, after Britain's annexation  of the  island  in  the  late 18th century, were  often owned by British  landholders. The vi cious cycle;of poverty was held intact by both  the continuation of the potato blight and the  active exportation of the Irish grain crop by the  British Grown. Those who traveled across the  ISiand during the famine noted the horrifying  ",1997

Look through  it. Turn one sheet after another. See if  you find mentioned in this document  cigarette  taxes. See  if you see it in  here.  There  is no mention  of cigarette  taxes in this. The reason is, you can not, in a budget resolution, carry out a  mandate that a cigarette  tax be  im posed. Let me repeat. If this amend ment is adopted, there is no assurance  that a cigarette tax will be imposed be cause you cannot do that in a budget  resolution. So let us look at it, page by  page. There  is no mention of a ciga rette tax. I repeat to Senator HATCH,  my very good friend, that there is abso lutely no assurance and no way,  in a  budget  resolution,  that you can  in struct the Finance Committee of the  Senate of the United States to levy any  kind of tax specifically.  You can change the total amount of  taxation and say, ""We sure hope, when  you change that, that you will pass a  cigarette tax."" I tell you that because  the budget resolution is not the place  to argue about what a  tax package is  going  to  look  like specifically, espe cially with reference to imposing a new  one.

71,Senate,105,-0.256,176,7,Mr. KOHL.," Madam President, I  rise  as a supporter of this budget and as a  sponsor  of  the Brownback-Kohl  en forcement amendment. This budget de serves  the support of the Senate  for  several reasons.  It is bipartisan and centrist. It finds  priorities-like  education  and  child  health-that transcend party lines. It  includes reasonable tax relief targeted  toward families and economic growth.  It balances the budget by the year 2002,  and it produces surpluses to reduce the  debt in the years after that.  In this budget, the Congress and the  administration have found a way to do  what  the American people have  long  asked us to do: Balance the budget in a  balanced manner-grow  the economy  without growing  income  inequality strengthen  the country by strength ening the working family.  The amendment I offer  today with  my colleague from Kansas makes this  very good budget stronger. It calls on  the Budget Committee  to report en forcement legislation that will lock in  the deficit targets in the agreement.  While  there are  some enforcement  provisions in the budget deal, we don't  think they go far enough. Our amend ment calls for enforceable caps on all  parts of the budget-entitlements, dis cretionary spending, and tax expendi tures. It requires windfall savings from  a good economy or lower than antici pated spending to be locked in to def icit reduction. And it calls for reform  in emergency spending procedures so  that Congress cannot use true disasters  as an excuse for off-budget spending on  favorite programs.  Again, said. Out amendment does not  change the budget deal. It strengthens  it.  It guarantees  that  the balanced  budget becomes a reality. And it will  assure the American people that we are  serious about reaching balance by 2002.  It is important that we make that as surance. This budget is open to criti cism because it increases  the deficit  from $67 to $90 billion in 1998 and 1999  before bringing it to 0 in 2002. All of the  deficit reduction in this agreement oc curs after the turn of the century.  We  simply are not credible  if we  promise to cut the deficit a couple of  years down the road. People have heard  that from Congress for too long. I urge  my colleagues to support this budget and more. I urge them to commit to it  by agreeing on strong enforcement pro cedures that will guarantee the deficit  reduction we promise. I urge my col leagues to support the Brownback-Kohl  amendment.

76,,105,0.484,254,7,Mr. RADANOVICH.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today to pay tribute to ArcWork of Fresno.  In  partnership with the Fresno Chamber of Com merce, ArcWork employs people with develop mental disabilities at jobs which enhance the  business environment and the community.  The ArcWork project was the vision of Larry  Willey, vice president of marketing  for  the  Fresno Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Willey  was aware that one of the priorities of Fresno  Mayor Jim Patterson was  to  keep Fresno  Clean and Green.  In  response,  it was pro posed that individual businesses and the Fres no Chamber of Commerce could sponsor var ious areas and pay ArcWork employees  to  keep them clean.  Since then, the concept of community and  corporate involvement to take care of the cit ies beautification has expanded greatly. Parks  were recently added to the list for the beautifi cation process, and various city agencies and  groups have become involved in the program.  The collaboration of resources has been so ef fective, the city of Fresno has been able to re direct its workers to more demanding projects.  The result: ArcWork crews are now capable of  picking up an  increasing number of general  city tasks.  The advent of  the ArcWork program has  been a win-win  for everyone  involved. Busi nesses have found the services to be cost ef fective, helping  to create a cleaner environ ment throughout Fresno. ArcWork also has al lowed business  to gain  recognition  for  the  positive contributions made  to  the program.  Municipalities have benefited by the increased  partnerships  that have been  forged between  the Fresno Chamber of Commerce and  the  business community, helping  to create em ployment opportunities for the developmentally  disabled. Most  importantly,  though, are  the  benefits that the ArcWork program has given  to  those with developmental disabilities who  want  to work and  increase  their  self-suffi ciency.  Mr. Speaker,  I admire  the success of the  ArcWork program. Working  together, the city  of Fresno, the Fresno Chamber of Commerce,  private organizations, and  local businesses  have found a beneficial way to solve some of  the challenges facing our city in a positive and  effective manner.  I ask my colleagues to join  me  in paying  tribute  to ArcWork, a program  that serves as a model of local grassroots in volvement throughout the Nation.  HON. BENNIE G.

77,,105,-0.592,267,7,Mr. PAYNE.," Mr. Speaker,  I ask my col leagues to join me  in congratulating the New  Jersey Arya Samaj Mandir, Inc. as they cele brate  the 31st anniversary of  the  independ ence of the Republic of Guyana. In honor of  this event, a commemorative flag-raising cere mony will  take place on Thursday, May 27,  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  1997 at 5:30 p.m., in the Council Chambers at  Jersey City Hall, 28 Grove Street, Jersey City,  NJ.  The word ""Guyana"" is an indigenous Indian  word  that means  land of many waters. This  land is believed to have been populated since  the 1200's by the Arawak, Carib and Warrow  tribes. Christopher Columbus was the first Eu ropean to have sailed along its coast in 1498.  Sir Walter Raleigh organized expeditions  in  the 1500's in search of the mystical city of El  Dorado believed in be in Guyana.  In 1621  the Dutch started to colonize Guy ana and  in 1640 the first slaves arrived from  Africa.  In 1763, about 100 years before  the  American Emancipation, the slaves in Guyana  revolted  in  the  ill-fated effort known as  the  Berbice Slave Rebellion.  In 1781  the British captured the colony but  were ousted within the year. From 1782 until  the  return of  the British  in 1812  the colony  was administered by French and Dutch admin istrations.  In 1835 laborers were brought in from Por tugal and 1838 marked  the beginning of  in dentured servitude with the arrival of laborers  from India. The Chinese came in 1853.  In 1953 elections were held for the first time  under the system of universal adult suffrage.  The People's Progressive [PPP] won this elec tion but was removed, after 133 days in office,  by the British.  The PPP was reelected in 1957 and again  in 1961. During  these  two  terms under  the  system of internal self rule,  the colony of the  then British Guiana experienced significant so cial and economic growth in spite of political  disturbances, especially in the early 1960's.  In  1964,  an  unpopular government was  brought to power through external influences.  It remained  in power until 1992 through con stant rigging of national elections.  In 1966, Guyana became an  independent  Nation and in 1970 it obtained republican sta tus.  On October 5, 1992 the  first free and  fair  elections were held since 1964. This election,  supervised by a team of international observ ers  led  by  former U.S.  President Carter  brought the PPP-civic government under the  Presidency of Dr. Cheddi Jagan to office.  Over 50 percent of Guyana's population  consists of East  Indians, whose  ancestors  came  to Guyana  from  India. Therefore, Mr.  Speaker, I would also like to applaud the New  Jersey Arya Samaj Mandir,  Inc. for their sup port of Hindu culture and serving  the edu cational, cultural, and  religious needs of the  Hindu immigrant population that lives in New  Jersey.  9309  One of those, in fact one of the best volun teer fire companies, is celebrating its 50th an niversary this year. On May 1, 1947, a group  of citizens gathered at the old North Hoosick  Schoolhouse on the corner of routes 22 and  67  to  form  the department. For the next 50  years the North Hoosick Fire Department has  provided  the communities of North Hoosick,  East Hoosick,  and Walloomsac with  out standing fire protection. These volunteer com panies, Mr. Speaker, save billions of dollars of  property and  countless  lives every year  in  New York State alone. Volunteers are increas ingly well-trained and professional. But more  than  that,  the spirit of volunteerism that they  exhibit is America at its best. Neighbor helping  neighbor at the local level. Thafs what volun teer fire companies are all about.  Mr. Speaker,  I know  that all 435 congres sional  districts  in  this  great  country  are  blessed with  their own volunteer  firefighters  who do equally fine work. Please join me  in  saluting  the North Hoosick Fire Department,  so ably led by Chief Alan J. Bornt, and all the  other members, and wish  them another 50  years of dedicated service to the community.  TRIBUTE TO JO-ANN MAXWELL  HON. ROBERT E.

78,,105,-0.297,267,7,Mr. ANDREWS.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  honor an individual who has dedicated her life  to education.  I am speaking of Ms. Jo-Ann  Maxwell, who will be retiring on May 22, 1997,  after a lifetime of exemplary service.  Ms. Maxwell has been involved in education  since  her  graduation  from  Indiana  State  Teachers College  in 1958. She holds certifi cates  in  secondary speech and dramatics,  secondary English, secondary education, as  well as an elementary certificate. Currently,  Ms. Maxwell  is using her skills as a basic  skills  instructor  for  the  upper  elementary  grades at Erial Elementary School. She has  shown a deep commitment to passing along  the skills  that each student will need  to be  successful  in  the  future. For her efforts, Ms.  Maxwell  received  the  prestigious  honor of  being selected as the 1986-87 Teacher of the  Year.  All who have known Ms. Jo-Ann Maxwell,  especially  those who  have  benefited  from  knowledge, are honored by her service to their  community. On behalf of all  the citizens of  New Jersey,  I  thank and congratulate Ms.  Maxwell. We all will miss her remarkable tal ents.

I know it was not easy. It was  difficult. But  I  think  the American  people  are  very  gratified  that  the  President  and  the Congress put  to gether the outlines of a budget agree ment which brings the budget deficit  down to zero.  One of the provisions in that agree ment is the amount we will spend on  highways and  transit for  the next 5  years. Under the budget agreement, the  highway and transit programs will re ceive funding levels equal to the esti mated revenue collected each year.  ",1997
82,Senate,105,-0.326,306,7,Mr. ROCKEFELLER.," Mr. President, I  thank  the  Presiding Officer  and  I  thank the Senator from Massachusetts.  I was listening to his speech. It was  very interesting.  Mr. President, I should say at the be ginning, I am an original cosponsor, of  Senator KERRY's bill, and proud to be  the second on a distinguished  list.  I  think there is a tendency in this body,  when we do something for children let's say we do a  tax credit or we do  something in Head Start or where we  do  something  in health care-to say  that we made a dent and we can go on  the next issue in the next year. I think  of all the areas of life that we deal with  in the Senate, that is the most inac curate assessment and approach. When  it comes to what our children need to  prepare for their futures and what they  are going to be like as adults, we need  to follow through. And we must begin  in the earliest years.  I spent a number of years in Japan.  In Japan, when a baby  is born, and  while the baby is growing to a certain  age,  they do not have cribs. They do  not have cdbs, because in Japan the  baby sleeps between  the mother and  the father. Why is that so? That is so  because  they, as a matter of culture  and history and  instinct, know  that  bonding has to start at the beginning.  That  is about  the  clearest  form  of  bonding that there can be.  But even before that, there is a Japa nese word called taikeo, in which the  pregnant mother talks to-and this is  standard  in Japan-they talk  to  the  baby in the womb on a regular basis.  That would make  a  fairly  strange  sight, I guess, walking down the streets  of Washington, DC, or West Virginia.  But  the  Japanese understand  some thing that Senator KERRY showed with  his  graphics  there  about  the  two  brains, that we clearly don't. They un derstand when you are looking at the  raising of children and  their future,  you have to take a holistic approach.  You have to start with early childhood  development.  You  have  to  follow  through, and keep providing the sup port, education and development sup port. And you must keep at it. That is  both enormously frustrating, but, in a  nation which purports to care about its  children, it is absolutely essential that  we understand  that helping children  and  strengthening  families  is  an  unending  job. The work on behalf of  children  is never finished, no matter  how much we do. In the private sector,  as  individual parents,  it is not good  enough. No matter what we do in the  public sector, there will be more that  could and should be done if we are seri ous about the real definition of chil dren's futureand we must be for their  sake, and the sake of our society.  I spent, as I have said before, as this  Senator said before on  this  floor, 4  years as the chairman of the National  Commission on Children. We  took a  comprehensive  look  at  children's  needs-income  security, health care,  education, values, and  the effects of  media. We did everything, and we came  out of it with a unanimous report. I  picked  the name  for  the publication  that we put out. I liked it. It was called  Beyond Rhetoric. That is what we have  to come  to terms with in this body,  that we are very good at the rhetoric.  In fact, on children-our rhetoric tends  to be more bipartisan than other sub jects which is good. And we actually do  some good things, insofar as the public  has any role in that, as apart from pa rental  responsibility  and  even  chil dren's responsibility to themselves.  But we are in a huge new world of re sponsibilities as parents, which I am as  a private citizen and concerned father.  I am also public citizen and a Member  of the Senate.  I have obligations  to  children as both a private citizen and  member of my community, and as a  public official as well. We are just not  going to get off easily if we accept the  challenge to move beyond rhetoric and  really do something for children.  So I think on this floor, we are going  to have to start thinking about those  graphs, about those  two brains. They  are  studies of contrasts-both kids'  brains, one kid getting attention, one  kid not getting attention. What a dif ference it makes.  I will say another final thing. We do  not purport or believe  that we  are  doing everything  for  the  future now  with this amendment. What we are try ing to do here is a  reserve clause to  capture the attention of the people. An  argument  that gets used here often,  but not very effectively,  is extremely  compelling  in  this case-we need  to  take action because of the children,  but we also need to act to save money  for the taxpayers in the future.  We hear that a  lot. People discount  it. They say, ""That's nice that for Head  Start, you save $10 for every dollar you  put in now."" But, we have to spend the  money  now,  to  save  the  long-term  costs of neglecting our children's early  development. That is what our problem  is. We are in a budget resolution here.  But in the case of children, we are  talking about spending billions and billions of dollars more on crime and re medial education, if we do not do the  right thing in the early years for chil dren.  Senator KERRY has  focused on  the  zero-through-6 period. He is doing that  with an intensity, with a passion which  is absolutely unmatched and which at tracted me. I tend to be a Member who  votes against amendments on this floor  to protect the integrity of this budget  deal, which I think we have to adopt.  But I feel so strongly that he is on the  right track and he is doing  the right  thing and  that  I  support  the Kerry  amendment. We have to learn to dis cipline ourselves  to exempt children  from  the way we ordinarily  look at  problems: Pass legislation, get the pri vate sector to do something, and then  go on to the next thing. Children, their  problems, their growth, their develop ment are vital and with us forever. The  time to start thinking about children  and their futures is right now.  I  thank  the Chair, and I yield the  floor.  ",1997
83,Senate,105,-0.352,306,7,Mr. KERRY.," Mr. President, I am par ticularly grateful to the Senator from  West Virginia. His work as the head of  the National Commission on Children  was absolutely extraordinary. It was  way ahead of its time. I am very hon ored to have him working as part of  this effort.  I  just say to him that the example  about Japan  that he  raised,  that  in  1965, when PAT MOYNIHAN first talked  about 27 percent then known as illegit imacy in America, the rate of illegit imacy in Japan was 1 percent. It is now  33 percent overall in America; that is  up from 27 percent. He was referencing  only African-Americans. It is now 69  percent among African-Americans  in  America;  49  percent among  the His panics;  and  27  percent  among  the  whites. It is still 1 percent in Japan-1  percent.  What is interesting is the Japanese  have an adage that the Senator is obvi ously familiar with. They say that the  soul of a 3-year-old will be with you for  100 years. They have been way ahead of  us;  they have understood  that.  I am  particularly  grateful  to  Senator  ROCKEFELLER for his participation and  effort in this.  ",1997

87,Senate,105,0.304,358,7,Mr. LUGAR.," Mr. President, I  intro duce legislation to repeal an outdated  agricultural  law  that has  cost  tax payers millions of dollars over the last  several years.  Historically, as part of its statutory  mandate  to support farmers' income,  the Department of Agriculture made  payments to farmers for  the planting  of certain crops and in cases of natural  disaster. In the process of carrying out  this mission, USDA sometimes mistak enly overpaid farmers.  A provision of  the 1990  farm bill,  known as the finality rule or the 90-day  rule,  allowed  farmers  to keep  these  overpayments if they were not discov ered within 90 days of the payment or  application for farm program benefits.  Repayment ""is required in cases of fraud  or misrepresentation  involving  the  farmer.  Whatever its merits in 1990, changes  in farm policy and new evidence indi cate that the finality rule should be re pealed. At the time of the 1990 farm  bill,  to be eligible  for  farm program  payments,  it was necessary  for  the  county or State USDA office to deter mine  that farmers were actively en gaged in farming and that their oper ations were structured properly. Farm ers often relied on  these determina tions before deciding which crops  to  plant,  the size of  the plantings, and  how to structure  their farming oper ation for the crop year.  However,  the  landmark  reforms  in  the 1996 farm bill eliminated these jus tifications for the finality rule. Under  the 1996 farm bill, farm payments are  no longer linked to the planting deci sions of farmers and the structure of  the farming operation  is unlikely  to  change. Today,  payments  are made  based on a formula which does not vary  from one year to the next.  The finality rule does not only apply  to farm program payments. It applies  to most types of payments received by  farmers including disaster relief assist ance. But these disaster payments have  been dramatically scaled back  in re cent years. In 1994, Congress passed the  Federal Crop Insurance Reform and De partment of Agriculture Reorganiza tion Act which largely eliminated dis aster  assistance  payments  for most  major crops.  Instead of disaster aid,  farmers were encouraged to buy crop  insurance.  A recent report from the General Ac counting Office provides  further evi dence that the finality rule should be  repealed. According to GAO, from No vember 1990  through September 1996,  USDA applied the finality rule to 10,694  cases in which the overpayments were  not discovered within the 90-day time frame. The  rule  allowed  farmers  to  keep  $4.2 million  in  overpayments.  Nearly 90 percent of the overpayments  involved  crop disaster  initiatives or  old-style  farm  programs which  no  longer exist.  GAO also looked closely at finality  rule payments in fiscal years 1995 and  1996. Even though the justification for  the finality rule was to prevent farm ers from having to repay large amounts  of money years after the money was  paid, GAO found that most of the over payments  involved  small  sums  and  were discovered within 9 months or  less. According to GAO,  in the years  studied, 86 percent of the finality rule  cases involved $500 or less. In addition,  59 percent had overpayments amount ing to 10 percent or less of the correct  payment amounts, and two-thirds were  discovered within 9 months of the date  of payment or the filing of a program  application.  It should be 11oted  that  while most of the overpayments were  ",1997

89,Senate,105,-0.395,371,7,Mr. LEVIN.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today  to pay  tribute  to Bruce  and  Christine Pesola,  of Marquette, MI,  whose restoration of the Landmark Inn  Hotel has preserved one of the Upper  Peninsula's architectural and historic  treasures for a new generation.  The Landmark Inn Hotel originally  opened on January 8,  1930,  and was  known as the Hotel Northland. At that  time,  the Northland was  the premier  hotel in the Upper Peninsula. Through out  the years,  the hotel has housed  many notable people, including Amelia  Earhart, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello,  and musical  legends Duke Ellington  and Louis Armstrong.  When Bruce  and Christine Pesola  purchased  the hotel  in 1995,  it had  stood vacant for more than 12 years.  While many people were calling for the  demolition of the building, the Pesolas  were dedicated to preserving this piece  of history. Described by one local news paper as a ""squalid, vacant blemish on  the city's skyline,"" the rehabilitation  of the Landmark Inn will contribute  significantly to restoration efforts in  downtown Marquette. As  a  longtime  proponent of historic preservation,  I  was pleased to support the Pesolas in  their efforts to secure the project's eli gibility for historic preservation cer tification from the Department of the  Interior, enabling  the Pesolas  to  re ceive federal tax credits in return for  their commitment to retaining the his toric characteristics of the hotel.  The renovation of the Landmark Inn  Hotel stands as an example of the bene fits of historic preservation. Not only  will Marquette gain a quality hotel in  the downtown area,  the people of the  city of Marquette and  the State of  Michigan will retain an important link  to the past. I know my colleagues will  join me in expressing congratulations  and best wishes for future success to  Bruce and Christine Pesola on the oc casion of  the grand opening of  the  Landmark Inn Hotel.

90,Senate,105,0.623,371,7,Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.," Mr.  President, I rise today to pay tribute  to the New Hampshire delegates who  represented  the Granite State at the  National Summit on Voluntarism  in  Philadelphia  from April  27  through  April 29. The 3-day summit focused on  the challenges facing our Nation's chil dren and youth, and encouraged Ameri cans to dedicate their time and talents  to communi ties and children. It was or ganized on the suggestion that Amer ica's young people have access to five  fundamental  resources.  These  re sources include an ongoing relations'P.ip  with an adult, safe places during non school hours to learn, a healthy start,  a skill through effective education, and  the opportunity to give back through  community service.  I would like today to honor the indi viduals from my state who gave their  time and energy so our children can re main safe and strong. They are: Amy  McGlashan of New Hampshire College  and University Council, Daniel Forbes  of St. Anselm College, Carlos Agudelo  of the ALPHA Alliance, Regis Lemaire  of the Office of Youth Services, David  Fish of the United Parcel Service, Dar lene E. Schmidt of CFX Bank, Joshua  Morse  of Southern New Hampshire  Services, JoAnn St. Pierre of the Vol untary Action Center, Ann Puglielli of  St. Anselm College, Richard Shannon  of New Hampshire Catholic Charities,  Susan Gilbert of Manchester, Suzanne  Carbon of the Grafton County Family  Court, Catie Doucette of  the White  Mountain School, Ed Farrell of  the  White Mountain School, Dick Fowler  of the Division of Children and Youth  Services, Katie Kelley of  the Path finders Program, Theresa Kennett of  Kennett High School, Bruce Labs of  Woodsville High School, Sara Lang of  Woodsville High School, Mike Purcell  of White Mountain Mental Health,  Lynn Wheeler of Nighswander, Lord &  Martin, Debbie Tasker of  the Dover  Adult Learning Center, Bernie Mucci of  Tyco International Ltd., Elise Klysa of  the Timberland Corp., Ron Borelli of  Aavid  Thermal  Technologies  Inc.,  Karen Brown of Channel 9 News, Chris  Gallagher of the Corporation for Na tional Service, Sidney Swartz of the  Timberland Corp., and Ken Freitas of  the Timberland Corp.  Each and every delegate  from  the  State of New Hampshire has achieved  success  in  effective  citizen  service.  They are experienced in creating op portunities for others to contribute to  solutions, and have a record of getting  things done. Above all, they are trust ed by others in their community and  for that they can be very proud.  The summit proved to be beneficial.  The representatives from New Hamp shire combined their efforts with delegates  from Delaware. They came up  with creative plans to bring adults and  college students into Manchester's pub lic schools together to help establish a  mentoring program. The New Hamp shire delegates will meet again in the  summer to review this proposal and the  other ideas they collected and decide  how to use them.  I commend the New Hampshire dele gates on their willingness to help make  the Granite State a better place  to  live, and to ignite the spirit of volunta rism to provide a strong foundation for  America's youth. New Hampshire  is  fortunate to be blessed by their leader ship and dedication. I applaud them for  their outstanding work, and am proud  to represent all of them  in the U.S.  Senate.   TRIBUTE TO RICHARD LLOYD  THOMPSON, SR.   ",1997
91,House,105,0.375,384,7,Mr. PORTMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  today the House con siders the Drug Free Communi ties Act  of 1997,  legislation  I  introduced with  the  gentleman  from  Illinois  HASTERT],  the gentleman from Michi-  gan  [Mr. LEVIN],  and  the gentleman  from New York [Mr. RANGEL]. This bill  provides needed support to our commu nities around the country to help them  wage the war on drugs, community by  community, child by child.  There is no more important battle to  fight for the future of our country, and  in my view, there is no more effective  way to win that war than to focus our  energies at the community level.  The bipartisan effort we have before  us today is the result of months and  months  of work with  communities  around the country, with top experts in  the field, with Members on both sides  of the aisle, with the administration. It  represents some new thinking. It takes  existing Federal drug control resources  and rechannels them to support com munity  antidrug groups  around  the  country that are actually working to  reduce teenage drug abuse.  I believe a shift in priorities to sup port effective, sustainable prevention  efforts is long overdue. We all know the  numbers. Tragically, after more than a  decade of substantial progress in reduc ing substance abuse among our kids  the trends have now reversed; and re versed dramatically. Teenage drug use  of marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, her oin, and other drugs is up. LSD use is  at its highest reported levels.  Of course, it is not just about num bers. It is about our kids and their fu tures  being  ruined. The Drug Free  Communities Act  is designed  to sup port  something we  know  actually  works in reducing drug abuse, commu nity-based coalitions. It does so in a  cost-effective manner.  Mr. Speaker, I would  like to high light the key features of this new ap proach. First, to qualify for a Federal  matching grant under this program a  local  community must  first  dem onstrate a comprehensive approach to  the problem. Experience in the field,  good research, and just common sense  tells us  that communities  that have  every major sector involved in this ef fort are those that are most effective.  In March 1997, a GAO report confirms  this for us. That is why this legislation  supports only those communities that  have mobilized youth, parents, busi nesses,  law  enforcement,  the media,  educators, and other key sectors that  have been working together with a fo cused mission and targeted strategies.  Second,  the  local community must  demonstrate that it is not dependent  on the Federal dollars. With local will  and local financial support, we think a  program is going to be more successful.  Without them, a program simply can not survive over the long haul.  Not one Federal dollar will be spent  under this program without a dollar or  more first having been generated by a  local community. A 100 percent match  is required, and no grant can exceed  $100,000.  The  Federal  Government  should be a catalyst to communities to  do the right thing. It will then be able  to sustain that effort over time, with  or without that Federal support.  Third, one of the most common and  often deserved criticism of Federal pro grams is that they lack accountability.  This bill requires that the local com munity have a system of evaluation in  place  that  actually measures  out comes,  consistent with well-accepted  standards. Successful  community  ef forts around  the country already do  that. They evaluate their effectiveness.  In order  to generate  local  financial  support in the private sector they sim ply have to do that.  Fourth, although the data indicates  that broad-based  local  efforts work  best, we also know that national and  State leadership can play a very help ful role at the local level. For example,  national and State experts in the field  can assist local communities by shar ing  the best  ideas  from  around  the  country, and by helping to put in place  effective systems to sustain and evalu ate the local efforts.  This bill encourages  local commu nities  to  involve  their Federal  and  their State leaders. The 44 Members of  Congress who have recently established  or worked with community antidrug  coalitions  in  their own districts can  speak from  their own experiences on  this. Some of them will today.  I can speak for mine. Over the past 2  years with Cincinnati in organizing the  Coalition. for a Drug-Free Greater Cin cinnati  in my hometown, we helped  mobilize our local community, but we  also brought national groups  to  the  table, like the Partnership for a Drug  Free America,  the Community Anti drug Coalitions of America, CATCA,  the National Parents Resource  Insti tute  for Drug Education, PRIDE, as  well as others in the State level. Be cause the drug issue is best addressed  at the local level, in my view, this bill  encourages all of us to focus our efforts  more there.  Fifth,  this  is not a matter of new  money, but getting more bang for the  buck from existing resources. The bill  redirects  to  communities  less  than  three-tenths of 1 percent of our exist ing money from the $16 billion Federal  drug  control budget. We  have been  working with appropriators in the full  committee and on the Treasury-Postal  Subcommittee to help identify the ap propriate offsets.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, to ensure this  program assists efforts that are truly  working, and to ensure it gives commu nities  the  flexibility  to  continue  to  fashion  innovative solutions  to  local  problems,  an  advisory  commission  made up of local community  leaders  and national and State experts in the  field of substance abuse will help select  the administrator and actually oversee  this program.  The  legislation has  the support of  hundreds of community groups in all 50  States;  national  leaders,  such  as  former drug czar Bill Bennett, former  HEW Secretary Joe Califano, National  Drug Prevention Groups like CATCA, I  mentioned PRIDE, the Partnership for  Drug Free America; and because it is  fiscally responsible, it has the support  of  the Council  for Citizens Against  Government Waste.  Before  I  conclude, Mr.  Speaker,  I  would like to thank all those groups  around the country who have helped us  put this effort together. Of course,  I  also want to commend my colleagues,  the  gentleman  from Michigan Mr.  LEVIN,  the gentleman from Wisconsin,  Mr. BARRETT, the gentleman from Illi nois, DENNY HASTERT,  the gentleman  from  Indiana, DAN BURTON,  the gen tleman  from  Maryland,  ELIJAH  CUMMINGS, and many others who actu ally helped improve this legislation.  Finally, I would like to pay tribute  to somebody else who is here, my chief  of staff, John Bridgeland. He actually  conceived  this  idea,  coordinated  the  drafting of the legislation, and helped  get it through the process.  D 1045  I really believe that his good work  and that of so many from both sides of  the aisle is going to make a difference.  It is actually going to make a mean ingful difference in the lives of our kids  around this country. I urge Members to  support this legislation so that we can  get on with the business of providing  communities the needed support they  need to reduce drug abuse.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  BARRETT  of Wisconsin. Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume, and I rise in support of  the Drug-Free Community Act of 1997.  Mr. Speaker, youth substance abuse  is an enormous problem. Studies show  that children who use drugs are two to  five times more likely to drop out of  school. One-quarter of our health care  costs are related  to substance abuse,  and more  than half of all child and  spousal abuse cases are related to sub stance abuse.  Unfortunately, we are not winning  the war on teenage drug abuse. In the  last 3 years teenage drug use has risen  78 percent. LSD and hallucinogen use  has increased 183 percent, and cocaine  use is up 166 percent.  The Monitoring  the Future Study  just released in December found that  Mr.  ",1997

93,House,105,0.635,397,7,Mr. ARMEY.," Mr. Speaker,  I would  like to address the House for the pur pose of making an announcement re garding the schedule for our Members.  Mr. Speaker, it is with a deep sense  of apology that I inform the Members  at this time that we will be unable to  do any further work  this evening on  the  legislative  business  before  the  House  that so many of our Members  have been so anxious about and that all  had had such high hopes that we might  be able to work further on tonight.  Circumstances between ourselves and  the other body have made it impossible  for us to do that work, in particular to  further work on the budget or the sup plemental  appropriations  bill.  That  work cannot be concluded tonight. In deed, it will not be work we can resume  again until after the recess period.  I would like to inform the Members  that I do not anticipate any further  votes this evening, any further work  before  the body,  and  that Members  should be advised that they are free to  return to their districts for the district  work period.  Again, I would like to apologize to  the Members, many of whom suffered  some terrible inconvenience, and some  of whom have suffered some bitter dis appointment about this announcement,  and I can only wish them Godspeed on  their journey to their districts and for  the best, most productive, and happy  work period possible.

172,,105,-0.146,423,7,Mr. PETERSON of Minnesota.," Mr. Speaker,  I strongly  support  the Sportsmen's Bill  of  Rights. As an avid hunter and fisherman, I be lieve that the hunting and angling community  serve as  the backbone  for  the preservation,  enhancement, and protection of natural and  wildlife resources, Hunters and anglers are the  foremost supporters of sound wildlife manage ment and conservation practices in Minnesota  and  the  rest of  the United States. Funds  raised through license, permit, and stamp pur chases, as well as excise  taxes on goods  used by hunters and anglers have generated  over $6,000,000,000 for wildlife research and  management.  Many  wildlife  opportunities  would not exist today if these conservation ef forts had not been created by hunters and an glers.  The  right  to hunt and  fish  is  increasingly  coming under attack. We are seeing broad  based challenges to hunting and fishing, and  hopefully  this bill will set  the standards  for  such  challenges much  higher.  Traditional  rights of hunters and anglers are continually  attacked by various organizations whose sole  aim  it to outlaw these outdoor activities. This  legislation is necessary to fend off opponents  of hunting and fishing.  Minnesota has about 450,000 deer hunt ers-probably the largest per capita in the Na tion,  100,000  small  game  and waterfowl,  grouse and pheasant hunters, and 1.6 million  licensed anglers in the State each year. Thus,  hunting and fishing is a significant part of both  the Minnesota tradition and this Nation's tradi tion.  This  type of  legislation  is also being pro posed and advocated in many States. For ex ample,  in 1996,  the Minnesota State Senate  approved a proposed amendment to the State  constitution giving Minnesota residents a con stitutional right to hunt and fish in the State.  Hunter-funded  land  acquisition  efforts  of  State wildlife agencies support a broad spec trum of public  recreation. With  fishing and  hunting generated moneys. States have se cured millions of acres of land for wildlife con servation. Fishing and hunting expenditures in  Minnesota alone generate millions of dollars  toward conservation efforts.  Hunting also provides a mechanism to con trol wildlife in areas where human tolerance is  limited, regarding damage to agricultural crops  and vegetation, nuisance problems, and vehi cle  collisions. Wildlife-caused  environmental  problems and human  conflicts can be de creased with  animal  damage management  techniques subsidized by hunters and anglers.  The economic value of hunting and angling  is indispensable in Minnesota, as well as other  State's economies. Fishing and hunting ex penditures in Minnesota total over $1.3 billion.  Furthermore, close to half a million jobs are di rectly and indirectly supported by hunting.  The purpose of this legislation is to leave a  legacy  for  future generations  to enjoy  the  same rights to hunt and fish  that the current  9465  generation enjoys  today. With  the  trend  to wards  increased urbanization,  there  is  less  and less access for people to really enjoy the  outdoors. Recreational  hunting  and  fishing  strengthens  family bonds and personal  rela tionships. These sporting activities often bring  parents and  children  together. The Sports men's Bill of Rights Act is crucial to ensure fu ture generations of sportsmen, women, and  children  the opportunity  to enjoy  the same  wildlife benefits and educational opportunities  that have previously been enjoyed.

174,,105,-0.362,436,7,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today  to pay special  tribute  to  the  Fritz Reuter  Altenheim Life Care Community on the occa sion of  its centennial anniversary. For 100  years, this organization has been committed to  the notion that our aged population deserves  the help of our whole community. This mo mentous occasion will be celebrated at a gala  dinner dance on Sunday June 1, 1997, in the  grand ballroom of Schuetzen Park,  in North  Bergen, NJ.  Founded in 1897 as a continuous care re tirement  community,  the  Fritz  Reuter  Altenheim home has  impacted  the  lives of  many. Originally designed  to accommodate  aging German  immigrants,  the home  con tained a chapel.  furnished  living quarters, a  dining room, and a kitchen. The cornerstone  of the Fritz Reuter Altenheim home was laid in  1898 and 1 year later, on June 15, 1889, the  first occupants moved in.  Due to dedicated and caring individuals, the  Fritz Reuter Altenheim home has expanded  tremendously,  .now  housing a  fully  staffed  nursing unit, a residential  facility, as well as  independent  living apartments, with all  facili ties open to all seniors.  Since its incorporation as a nonprofit organi zation  in 1897,  it has been  funded  in  large  part by donations, voluntary efforts, and be quests.  It  is kindness and selflessness  that  keeps this home alive and enables it to grow.  I ask that my colleagues join me  in recog nizing  the Fritz Reuter Altenheim Life Care  Community for its outstanding work and comMay 22, 1997  mitment.

175,,105,-0.547,436,7,Mr. BONIOR.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I would  like to congratulate Mr. AI Grimson as he re tires from his job as accounting manager from  the Macomb County Finance Department. His  colleagues will honor him with a dinner and re ception at the end of this month.  For 23 years, AI has been a dedicated and  committed accountant for Macomb County. In  197 4, AI  began working as an auditor  for  Macomb County Community Mental Health. AI  later went on  to serve Macomb County in a  variety of positions. He became the adminis trative assistant for the budget and finance de-  partment, an audit officer for the internal audit  department before becoming  the accounting  manager. His participation in accounting asso ciations,  his  background,  and  experience,  made him a valuable member and  leader in  the  financial  departments  within Macomb  County.  In an era when community service has be come so important, AI  is a shining example of  a dedicated volunteer. As a Berville Lion and  a member of the Elks Club, AI has been com mitted  to  improving  the  lives  of  people  throughout the community. He has also been  on the Selfridge base community council, Fra ternal Order of Police, and a marine safety of ficer. As a father, he also knows how impor tant children are and became a football and lit tle league coach. AI has touched the lives of  many people  in  the community  through his  participation in so many activities.  Over the years, Al's experience, leadership,  and knowledge have made him an  incredible  asset to Macomb County and Macomb Coun ty's Finance Department. I would like to thank  AI for all of his contributions and wish him and  his family all of the best.  THE  MEDICAL  DEVICE'  REGU LATORY  MODERNIZATION  ACT  OF 1997  HON. ANNA G.

176,,105,0.377,449,7,Mr. GINGRICH.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  bring my colleagues' attention to the attached  Washington  Times  editorial  from May  19,  1997-""Defanging the Estate Tax Vampire.""  This piece thoughtfully lays out the arguments  for repealing the death tax.  As I often say,  I do not believe that Ameri cans should have to visit the IRS at the same  time they must see the undertaker. Abolishing  the death tax is one of the most important ac tions we can take on behalf of America's fam ily owned businesses and farms.  Building a successful business to pass onto  children and grandchildren  is a part of  the  American dream  that we should  lift up-not  squelch. It is vital that we use examples such  as this piece to make our case and build sup port everywhere in America for abolishing the  death tax.  [From the Washington Times, May 19, 1997]  DEFANGING THE ESTATE TAX V AMPffiE  (By Bruce Bartlett)  There is a growing support on Capitol Hill  for abolishing the estate tax, which has been  part of the federal tax system since 1916. A  number of bills that would do so have been  introduced,  including H.R.  902  and S.  29,  sponsored by Rep. Chris Cox and Sen. Rich ard Lugar, respectively. Hearings have al ready been held in both the House Ways and  Means Committee and Senate Finance Com mittee.  One of the strongest arguments for repeal  is that the estate tax is disproportionately  burdensome relative to the revenue it raises.  In no country is the estate tax a significant  source of revenue. Even egalitarian Sweden  raises  just 0.1 percent of its revenue  this  way. And the average for all members of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development, the association of Western in dustrialized countries, is just 0.4 percent. In  the United States,  the  estate  tax  raises  about 1.1 percent of  total  revenue, which  puts us at the upper end of the list.  With the estate tax raising such a small  percentage of revenue, it would not be dif ficult  to  find alternative  revenue  sources  that would raise the same amount. For ex ample, taxing capital gains at death would  raise as much revenue as the estate tax far  more simply and at a lower rate. (Under cur rent law, heirs pay capital gains tax only on  the increase from the time of inheritance.  Thus the estate itself pays no capital gains  tax at all, no matter how much the assets  may have appreciated.)  Supporters of repeal often point to Canada  and Australia as examples of countries that  have abolished their estate taxes in recent  years. However,  the number of countries  with no estate tax is actually much longer.  A review of Coopers & Lybrand's latest inter9491  national tax guide found at least 46 countries  with no  estate or  inheritance  taxes. Al though some are small countries known for  being tax havens, many are not. These in clude Israel, Mexico, New Zealand and Swit zerland, among others.  To be sure, the absence of an estate tax  does not mean wealth transfers are entirely  free of tax. Canada, Australia and Israel tax  capital gains at death. Some countries treat  inheritances as ordinary income for tax pur poses, while others impose stamp duties and  transfers. New Zealand and India tax gifts  even though there is no tax on estates. And  while Switzerland has no federal estate tax,  25 of the 26 canons (states)  impose such a  tax. Nevertheless,  this  review  shows  that  should the United States choose to eliminate  its death taxes, we would have a good deal of  company.  HEALTHSOURCE SAGINAW: CARING  FOR THE COMMUNITY  HON.

177,,105,-0.184,449,7,Mr. BARCIA.," Mr. Speaker, my colleague  [Mr. CAMP] and I, rise today to recognize a fa cility that serves both of our districts, providing  some of the best health care that people can  find anywhere: HealthSource Saginaw. This  facility has  been  in  operation  since  1930,  when it was first known as Saginaw Commu nity Hospital, and continues to be a vital pro vider of ongoing and emergency care  in  the  Saginaw area.  The  facility describes  its mission as being  ""to  restore persons we serve  to meaningful  lifestyles by providing select,  innovative, effi cient services in a coordinated continuum of  care."" From its Saginaw Township location, it  offers behavioral medicine services, rehabilita tion  services,  and  subacute  and  extended  care.  Mr. Speaker, an institution is only as good  as  its personnel, and  it is our view  that the  512 employees of HealthSource Saginaw are  among  the best. Their caring attitude con veyed to patients each and every day help this  hospital  to  retain  its  reputation as a sought after facility.  As we continue  to expect our health care  providers to use the best available technology,  maintain the highest level of proficiency indi vidually, and hold costs to reasonable  levels,  we  believe  that  facilities  like HealthSource  Saginaw merit recognition. We urge all of our  colleagues to join us in offering our thanks for,  and recognition of, HealthSource Saginaw.  HEALTHSOURCE SAGINAW: CARING  FOR THE COMMUNITY  HON.

In too many  schools across our Nation the focus for  our children is not on education but  survival. Just 2 days ago, as  I  read  from the Washington papers, four teen agers were arrested and charged with  gang  raping  a  14-year-old  girl  last  month by luring her from a cafeteria at  a public high school in Queens to an  unused classroom to carry out the at tack,  the authorities said yesterday.

179,Senate,105,0.366,475,7,Mr. FRIST.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today in support of Senate Concurrent  Resolution  27,  the  1998  concurrent  budget resolution, which outlines the  bipartisan budget agreement between  the President and the Congress. While I  acknowledge  the  legislation's short comings, I support the overall agree ment because it is a step in the right  direction for our country.  Before I begin,  I want to commend  Senator DOMENICI and the other nego tiators for their tireless and unwaver ing  commitment  to  reaching  this  agreement. Their leadership serves the  American people well.  Today, this bipartisan balanced budg et resolution fulfills a series of prom ises that we made to the American peo ple. We promised  to pass a balanced  budget by 2002-reflecting our commit ment  to economic growth,  fiscal  re sponsibility, and the simple principle  that our Government should live with in its means. Today, the plan before us  will achieve that goal. We promised to  strengthen Medicare-reflecting  our  commitment to the health care of sen ior citizens. Today, the plan before us  will extend the solvency of Medicare's  part A hospital  insurance  trust fund  for 10 years and make structural re forms that will preserve the program in  the future.  We promised tax relief to help fami lies and promote economic growth-re flecting our belief that the American  people, rather than the Federal Gov ernment, should make decisions about  how  to  spend,  save, or  invest  their  hard-earned income. Today, the agree ment before us includes $250 billion in  permanent tax cuts over 10 years  in cluding a $500-per-child tax credit, cap ital gains relief, death tax reform, ex panded individual retirement accounts  [IRA's], and education tax incentives.  For every $1  in new spending, we cut  taxes $3.50.  We also promised to reduce the size  and scope of the Federal Government.  Today, the agreement before us reduces  total Government spending $320 billion  over 5 years and more than $1 trillion  over 10 years. That's savings of $1,200  over 5 years and $3,800 over 10 years for  each man, woman, and child in Amer ica. In fact, for every new $1 added to  this budget, we reduce spending $15.  In  constructing  this  budget,  we  promised to reject gimmicks and rosy  economic scenarios in our assumptions.  Unlike the President's past two budg ets, the agreement before us does not  ",1997
180,Senate,105,-0.212,566,7,Mr. BAUCUS.," Mr President, the U.S.  mutual  fund  industry has become a  dominant  force  in  developing, mar keting, and managing assets for Amer ican investors. Since 1990, assets under  management  by U.S. mutual  funds  have grown from $1  trillion to about  $3.5  trillion  today. Yet, while direct  foreign investment in U.S. securities is  strong, foreign investment in U.S. mu tual funds has remained relatively flat.  Mr President,  today  I  am  intro ducing,  along with Senators GORTON  and MURRAY,  the Investment Competi tiveness Act of 1997. This legislation,  which I have had the honor of cospon soring in each of the last three Con gresses, would eliminate a major bar rier to attracting foreign capital into  the United States while improving the  competitiveness  of  the U.S. mutual  fund industry.  This legislation would remove a bar rier to the sale and distribution of U.S.  mutual  funds  outside  the  United  States. The bill would change the In ternal Revenue Code  to provide  that  foreign investors in U.S. mutual funds  be accorded the same tax treatment as  if they had made their investments di rectly in U.S. stocks or shares of a for eign mutual fund.  Under current law, most kinds of in terest and short-term capital gains re ceived directly by an investor outside  the United States or received through  a foreign mutual fund are not subject  to the 30-percent withholding tax on  investment income. However, interest  and short-term capital gain income re ceived by a foreign investor through a  U.S. mutual fund are subject  to  the  withholding tax. This result occurs be cause current law characterizes inter est income as short-term capital gain  distributed by a U.S. mutual fund to a  foreign investor as a dividend subject  to withholding.  The Investment Competitiveness Act  would correct  this  inequity and put  U.S. mutual  funds on a  competitive  footing with  foreign  funds. The bill  would correctly permit interest income  and short-term capital gain to retain  their character upon distribution.  Current law acts as a prohibitive ex port  tax  on  foreign  investors who  choose to invest in U.S. funds. That is  why .the amount of foreign investment  in U.S. mutual funds is small.  Mr President, it is time to dismantle  the unfair and unwanted tax barrier to  foreign  investment  in U.S. mutual  funds. The American economy will ben efit from exporting U.S. mutual funds,  creating an additional inflow of invest ment  into U.S.  securities markets  without a dilution of U.S. control of  American business that occurs through  direct foreign investment in U.S. com panies. Moreover,  the legislation will  support  job creation among ancillary  fund service providers  located in the  United States, rather than in offshore  service facilities.  Mr President, I very much appreciate  the  efforts of Senators GORTON  and  MURRAY  in cosponsoring  this  legisla tion and I urge my colleagues to sup port this bill.  By Mr. CRAIG:  S.  816. A  bill  to  amend  title  18,  United States Code,  to provide a na tional  standard  in  accordance with  which nonresidents of a State may  carry certain concealed firearms in the  State, and to exempt qualified current  and  former  law enforcement officers  from State  laws prohibiting the car- rying of concealed handguns;  to  the  Committee on the Judiciary.  THE PERSONAL SAFETY AND COMMUNITY  PROTECTION ACT  ",1997
181,Senate,105,0.494,566,7,Mr. CRAIG.," Mr. President, I rise to  introduce  the  Personal  Safety  and  Community Protection Act.  In  recent years,  a movement has  swept the Nation to enable individuals  to carry concealed firearms for  their  protection.  Forty-two  of  the  fifty  States have some right-to-carry permit  mechanism in place, and they are find ing these laws make a significant im pact on crime.  The benefits of right-to-carry  laws  were verified by a landmark study re leased late last year. Following a com prehensive  analysis  of  annual  FBI  crime statistics from all the Nation's  counties, over 15 years,  the authors  concluded:  [a]llowing  citizens  to  carry  concealed  weapons deters violent crimes and it appears  to produce no increase in accidental death or  suicides. If those states who did not have  right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had  adopted  them  in 1992,  approximately 1,800  murders and over 3,000 rapes would have been  avoided yearly ...  The primary author of  the  study,  John R. Lott Jr. of the University of  Chicago Law School, has pointed out  that  the benefits of concealed-carry  laws are not limited to those who carry  the weapons but extend to their fellow  citizens, as well. The drop in crime is  not necessarily the result of using fire arms in self-defense, but of criminals  changing their behavior to avoid com ing into direct contact with a person  who might have a gun-which in a con cealed-carry State could extend to a  wide cross-section of the public.  The  legislation  I  am  introducing  today builds on the experience of the  States. It is designed to protect  the  rights of citizens no matter where they  may travel in the United States, and to  enhance the protection of our commu nities.  This bill applies to any person hold ing a valid concealed firearm carrying  permit or license issued by a State, and  who is not prohibited from carrying a  firearm under Federal law.  In States that issue concealed carry  permits, the individual would be able  to carry a concealed firearm in accord ance with State laws. In States that do  not have right-to-carry laws,  the bill  sets a  reasonable, bright-line Federal  standard  that would permit carrying  except  in certain designated places,  such as police stations; courthouses;  public  polling  places;  meetings  of  State, county, or municipal governing  bodies; schools; passenger areas of air ports.  The second part of the bill provides  an exemption for certain qualified cur rent and former law enforcement offi cers, who bear valid written identifica tion of their status, from laws prohib iting  the carrying of concealed  fire arms. The bill does not override any  existing  training requirements or re strictions on gun ownership or use by  current or former law enforcement offi cers. The individuals covered by this  section of the bill have proven records  of responsible,  lawful gun use  in de fense of their fellow citizens and com munities.  ",1997
182,Senate,105,0.014,579,7,Mr. JEFFORDS.," Mr. President, I rise  today to pay tribute to six outstanding  young women who are being presented  with the Girl Scout Gold Award by the  Vermont Girl Scout Council. They are  Melissa  Jones  and Tina Newell  of  Vergennes,  Kathleen  Lomedico  of  Colchester as well as Jennifer To bin,  Vincenza Tortolano, and Lori Brown of  Rutland. They are being honored on  May 29, 1997  for earning  the highest  achievement award in U.S. Girl Scout ing.  The Girl Scout Gold Award symbol izes outstanding accomplishments  in  the  areas  of  leadership,  community  service, career planning, and personal  development. The award can be earned  by girls aged 14-17, or in grades 9-12. To  receive  the award,  these Girl Scouts  first earned four interest project patch es,  the Career Exploration Pin,  the  Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award  and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge as  well as designing and implementing a  Girl Scout Gold Award project to meet  a special need in their communities.  As members of  the Vermont Girl  Scout Council, Melissa and Tina first  earned badges in understanding your self and others, child care, games, cre ative writing, and reading. The girls  then combined their efforts in a project  to combat illiteracy. They designed a  series of  three workshops  for young  children  about  the magic  of books  which they put on at their local town  library. The workshops featured a ma gician,  hired with money  the  girls  raised  themselves, magic  tricks and  crafts taught by the girls, and wonder ful stories featuring magic. They at tracted a  large number of youngsters.  The girls reported ""everything we did  interested and excited  the  children;  they wanted to read more books and  they now know  the  library and are  planning to come to their future chil dren's programs"".  Jennifer and Vincenza put their ef forts into making a special place for  some elderly members of their commu nity. The girls designed and established  a conversation garden to give nursing  home residents and their guests access  to sidewalks, shade, and beauty, put ting in two settees and planting bulbs  and a  flowering crabapple tree, all fi nanced by the girls' sale of handmade  cookbooks. To quote the nursing home  administrator, ""these two young peo ple have earned the respect and appre ciation of 125 nursing home residents  and 160 employees of Eden Park"".  As a member of the Vermont Girl  Scout Council, Lori first earned badges  in child care,  reading, music, games,  well being and understanding yourself  and others. She then used these skills  to design and  implement a  series of  Lenten workshops for the younger chil dren  in her parish church. Kathleen  earned badges in artistic crafts and ex ploration among others. After learning  leadership skills  through Girl Scout ing, she served as the editor of her high  school yearbook. As her Girl Scout  Gold Award project she spent the last  year organizing and  leading a youth  group  for  teens which meets  every  other week and a youth band which  plays every Sunday for her church par ish. Kathleen wanted the young people  in her parish to ""feel a sense of home  in  the church."" Both girls used  the  skills they learned in Girl Scouting to  help the church of their faith.  These  six Senior Girl Scouts have  earned my respect and admiration.  I  believe all the girls should receive the  public recognition due  them for such  significant services  to  their commu nities and their country.   TRIBUTE TO EDWARD P. SCOTT   ",1997

Anna was born on August 29, 1907 at 37  Hayes Street in Newark. She attended Newton  Street School. When she was 1 0 years old,  Anna and her family moved to 383 South 9th  Street in Newark where she attended the 14th  Avenue School.  Anna managed  to  complete  the  seventh  grade in a time when daughters were not en couraged  to stay  in school and  receive an  education. At the age of 13, she was forced to  leave school and go to work. There were 1 0  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  children  in her family and she and her older  sister had to work in a local tailor shop. She  worked on a sewing machine all week and at tended  the continuation school 1 day each  week so that she could  receive her working  papers.  When Anna was 21 years old, she married  Angelo Crincoli. She and Angelo worked in a  small grocery store. Anna was  relieved  to  work  in a grocery store because she would  never again have  to worry about food. She  knew there would always be plenty to eat.  Anna has two sons, Anthony and Dominick,  seven grandchildren and eight great-grand children who are the joy of her life. She fondly  remembers her mother who  lived  to be 96  years of age and would share with Anna many  stories of Italy. She also remains close to her  four sisters and five brothers. Always active in  the community, Anna belongs  to  the Rosary  Altar Society in St. Rocco's Church in Newark,  the Belleville Club on Mill Street and the Fri day Club in Bloomfield.

190,House,105,0.551,761,7,Mr. HERGER.," Mr. Speaker,  I strongly sup port H.R. 1420, The National Wildlife Refuge  System  lmproverT)ent Act of 1997, and  take  this opportunity to clarify the scope and appli cation of this important legislation.  This Act directly affects 509 wildlife refuges,  covering 92 million acres of Federal lands, in  all 50 States and  territories. These  refuges  provide enjoyment  for millions of Americans  each year, while at the same time they protect  and preserve vital habitat and species for fu tures generations. Our Federal Government,  however, has managed  its refuge system for  more than 30 years without any clear mission  or direction.  H.R. 1420 provides a beacon of  light  for  public lands management on our natiOnal wild life refuges by establishing a mission  ''to ad minister a national network of lands and wa ters  for  the conservation, management and,  where appropriate, the restoration of fish, wild life, and plant resources and their habitats for  the benefit of present and  future generations  of Americans."" For  far  too  long  the Federal  agency responsible for maintaining these ref uges,  the United States Fish and Wildlife  Service, has proceeded without direction or in structions on how to manage our national ref uges. They have been left to their own whims  to make arbitrary decisions  regarding who  may or may not gain access to our refuge sys tem. Now, local administrators will be provided  a clear definition of wildlife-dependent  rec reational activities that are considered  ""com patible uses"" within our national refuge sys tem.  It is important to note that this legislation ap plies  directly  to  ''wildlife-dependent  recre ation,"" and defines this type of recreation as:  hunting,  fishing, wildlife observation and pho tography, or environmental education and  in terpretation. This  legislation does not, how ever, apply  to,  preclude, or otherwise bar  other activities vital to management of our na tional  refuge system. Most particularly,  this  legislation does not preclude mosquito control  activities. Mosquito abatement on our national  refuges  is  integral  to providing for the public  health  and  safety  of  communities  in  and  around the refuge system. Without these  im portant activities our national refuges become  breeding grounds for disease carrying mosqui toes  that migrate  from  the refuges,  travelling  anywhere  from 20 to 50 miles,  to  infect ani mals and humans who  live  in neighboring  urban and rural communities. Mosquito control  activities do not materially interfere with or de tract from the fulfillment of the mission or pur pose of the refuge system, but they do have  a direct positive  impact on public health and  safety.  I support H.R. 1420 and join with my col leagues in providing common sense direction  for management of our national  refuge sys tem.  ",1997
191,House,105,-0.552,761,7,Mr. MILLER of California.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise in support of H.R. 1420. As my colleagues  are aware,  I opposed bills last Congress and  again  in  this Congress  that would  have  harmed the 92-million-acre national wildlife ref uge system by making  recreational uses a  purpose of the system and by establishing a  process for determining compatible uses that  favored  some activities over others. These  bills also placed new restrictions on  the Fish  and Wildlife Service  in acquiring and man aging refuge  lands that would have  impeded  its ability to conserve fish and wildlife.  However,  this compromise  resolves  those  concerns in a way that I hope will satisfy the  diversity of users of our wildlife refuges, from  bird watchers  to duck hunters. This bill  rep resents a bona fide compromise that resulted  from concessions on both sides.  I think per haps the most important result of this process  has been the realization by environmentalists  and hunters that many of their interests really  do coincide  in  the  long  run. The goals  they  seek and  the activities they enjoy are all de pendent on our assuring that there are abun dant, healthy wildlife populations.  I believe  H.R. 1420 accomplishes that.  First and foremost, H.R. 1420 builds a solid  foundation for managing the refuge system by  making conservation the singular, fundamental  mission of the system.  In support of the mis sion, the bill requires conservation plans to be  developed  for each  refuge and  requires  the  Secretary of the Interior to ensure that the bio logical  integrity, diversity, and health of  the  system are protected. The bill establishes a  well-defined process  for deciding what uses  are compatible with wildlife conservation and  the purposes of each  refuge.  Importantly, no  use is allowed on a refuge until  it has been  determined that the use will not have a tan gible adverse impact on the conservation mis sion of the system or the purposes of the ref uge where  the activity will  take place. Once  permitted, compatible activities remain subject  to appropriate regulation.  In addition, H.R. 1420 acknowledges the ex cellent outdoor recreational opportunities pro vided to the public by the refuge system. The  bill gives  recreational uses  that depend on  wildlife-fishing, hunting, nature observation  and  photography,  and  environmental  edu cation and  interpretation-priority over other  uses of the system. Of course,  these  impor tant recreational uses of the system are  the  result of sound wildlife conservation because  they depend on abundant wildlife.  As with any compromise, not every problem  can be addressed to everyone's satisfaction.  In particular,  I want  to express my concern  that language directing the Secretary of the In terior  to provide  ""increased opportunities  for  families  to experience compatible wildlife-de pendent recreation"" not be  taken as a direc tive to divert scarce operational funding for the  construction  of  roads,  visitor  facilities  and  other  amenities. Where  appropriate,  such  amenities provide  important public access  to  the system's wildlife resources, but wildlife and  wildlife habitat should come first.  There has also been considerable discus sion about the definition of a refuge. The bill's  definition is consistent with the Fish and Wild life Service's interpretation of a refuge as an  area in which the United States has a property  interest. I think it is important to note that the  United States may have an  interest in refuge  lands that extends beyond a property interest.  However, any authority to protect that interest,  to the extent it exists, is neither enhanced nor  diminished by this legislation.  I would  like to commend Secretary Babbitt  for taking  the  time and  the  initiative to bring  disparate  interests  together  to  negotiate.  I  would also like to commend Messrs. DrNGELL  and YouNG for their willingness to seek com mon ground. Although we  initially disagreed  on how to manage it,  they never wavered  in  their support for the refuge system. The fragile  coalition  that was built  to broker  this com promise  is  likely  to be sorely  tested  in  the  other body, but if we can hold it together, I be lieve the  refuge system will be the better for  it.  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. Many of the  refuge system's past problems resulted  from  the  individual refuges not being managed as  part of a larger system. This bill builds on the  original vision of the gentleman from Michigan  [Mr. DINGELL] of a true national wildlife refuge  system. H.R. 1420 ensures  that wildlife  ref uges, the only public lands dedicated to wild life conservation, are properly managed and  protected, while encouraging greater public  appreciation of wildlife and use of the refuge  system. Whether you  like to shoot birds with  a Browning or a Nikon, H.R. 1420 will en hance your appreciation and use of the refuge  system.  I urge the House to support the bill.  ",1997
192,House,105,-0.455,761,7,Mr. FARR of California.," Mr. Speaker, I sup port H.R. 1420, because:  it clarifies that the  mission of the  refuge system,  first and  fore most,  is  to conserve  fish and wildlife, with  wildlife dependent  recreation and education  secondary, and other uses as  its  lowest pri ority;  it establishes a more formal and public  process to determine what uses are compat ible on  refuge  lands; and  it  requires com prehensive planning with public participation.

193,House,105,-0.256,774,7,Mr. SPRATT.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes  to  the gentleman from New  Jersey [Mr. MENENDEZ].  ",1997
194,House,105,-0.362,774,7,Mr. MENENDEZ.," Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank the gentleman from South Caro lina  [Mr. SPRATT]  for yielding and I  rise to support the motion that he is  going  to offer  to  instruct conferees,  and I would hope that the gentleman  from Ohio [Mr. KASICH] would support  the motion because, in fact, it is about  making sure that there are no tax in creases in the future.  As someone who voted for the budget  deal, I believe a deal is a deal. But the  budget deal is only truly a deal if we  balance the budget not merely on the  numbers but on the principles. That is  why we must use the 10-year outlook  on tax revenues. There is nothing mag ical about hitting a date in 2002 and  then returning to deficits because we  have planted the seeds of fiscal insta bility. Ten-year  revenue  figures  are  about as honest as we can get. It is  very hard, however, to conceal tax ex penditures which  blossom  and  pro liferate after 5 years if we use the other  body's revenue baselines.  The mess we are in today is because  of spending binges which began in 1981  when we massively  front-loaded  de fense spending and tax cuts. These two  measures  created  the  tidal wave  of  deficits 6, 7, and 8 years later that is  causing the fiscal pain that we are ex periencing today.  It was voodoo economics back then,  and we should not resort to smoke and  mirrors now. The real magic is to keep  the budget balanced in 10 years. Let us  keep the deal to permanent fiscal re sponsibility and use the most honest  figures,  the 10-year estimates. I urge  my colleagues to make this an honest  deal and vote  for  the motion  to  in struct conferees when it is offered.  ",1997
195,House,105,-0.325,774,7,Ms. STABENOW.," Mr. Speaker, first I  would rise to once again to congratu late all parties on both sides of the  aisle for putting together this balanced  budget agreement, which  I was very  proud to support. It is not just about  numbers,  however,  it  is  about  pro tecting our values for our families. And  that  is  the  reason why  I  rise  this  evening to support the motion to in struct, which I think is incredibly im portant if we are to maintain the in tegrity  in  the outyears of balancing.  the budget and maintain our values  that are outlined in the balanced budg et agreement.  I had an opportunity to spend time  over the district workweek in my dis trict, holding office hours in grocery  stores and local restaurants, talking to  my constituents about  this balanced  budget agreement. They told me they  liked  the  fact  that  education was  placed as No. 1 in the priorities for in vestment. They  liked  the  fact  that  children's health and health care  for  working families that do not now have  health care was important to the proc ess, as well as protecting the environ ment and creating jobs. But they ex pressed one concern, and that was over  and over again: Who will receive  the  tax cuts that are being proposed?  Because in their minds, their history  has been for the last 15 to 20 years that  they, as working families, middle-class  Americans,  small businesses,  family owned farms, have not seen the bene fits of the bulk of the tax cuts that  have been instituted since  the 1980's,  and they are asking, whether it is a  family-owned farmer who has put all of  their hard work and sweat into their  land, that they be protected in terms of  the estate tax, and I very strongly sup port eliminating  the  estate  tax  for  those family-owned farmers or family owned small business, or whether it is  a young couple, not so young couple,  depending on your perspective, in their  forties whose children just went off to  college and they need to get a smaller  home now but all of their investments  are  tied up in equity in their house.  That is their savings, and they are say ing, can we please have capital gains  protection for us as working people.  I would urge the committee to make  sure that when we are done, tax cuts go  to those who need it the most.  ",1997
196,House,105,0.314,774,7,Mr. KASICH.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Michi gan [Mr. SMITH].  ",1997
197,House,105,0.505,774,7,Mr. SMITH of Michigan.," Mr. Speak er, if a Member could respond from the  other side briefly, I am very concerned  about this because what we are adopt ing is a sense of Congress passed by the  Senate. And in section 321(2),  it says  that if revenue starts going down after  the year 2007, will increase taxes.  Most of the speakers over there say,  look, we want a tax cut, we do want it  to go to the American working family.  But  (2),  the gentleman  from South  Carolina [Mr. SPRATT] says, after 2007,  if revenues start going down, increase  taxes. That is not what we want. And I  do not  think we  should accept  that  idea that somehow if there is a slump  in the economy, what we do and how  we  instruct conferees  is  to  increase  taxes so that they do not have any rev enue loss after the year 2007.  ",1997
198,House,105,0.361,787,7,Mr. PAPPAS.," If the gentleman would  yield, the death tax that he referred to  is even important to agriculture in a  State such as mine. It is the Garden  State, and we are very fortunate  in  central New Jersey to have many very  productive and active farms, and farms  that are owned by families for genera tions.  But the elimination of the death tax,  I believe,  is an environmental  issue,  certainly  in an area  such  as mine  where there is such pressure for devel opment, and that many of these fam ily-owned farms where certainly it is  the desire for these farms to be passed  from one generation to the next, that  the heirs sometimes are not in a posi tion of determining whether they even  want to continue to farm because they  cannot pay the estate tax bill.  There was an instance in my district  just last year  that a  longtime, very  prominent farmer had passed away and  his daughter wanted to keep the farm  from being developed and she was not  able to pay it. But we have a farm pres ervation program in our State where  development  rights are purchased by  the counties and the State and paid to  the  landowner, so  the farm has been  preserved in perpetuity. But that is not  always the case and those options are  not always available.  I personally  just want  to conclude  my participation here tonight by say ing how privileged I am to be serving  with these three gentlemen. I know the  commitment  that  they have  to  fos tering an economic environment that  can help the little guy and the little  gal, and that is what we are talking  about here  tonight. We  are  talking  about  fairness, we are  talking about  really helping those that just want the  opportunity  to pursue  the American  dream in their own way. That is all  they are looking for. They are looking  to be  treated  fairly,  looking for  the  chance, and some of these things that  we have spoken about  tonight would  just provide  that chance  to so many  people in our great country.  ",1997
199,House,105,0.199,787,7,Mr. FOX.,"  If the gentleman would  yield, I also want to conclude by saying  that H.R. 1145 is key legislation in this  Congress.  It  is bipartisan.  It  is pro  business. It is pro jobs. It is pro family.  And it is long overdue to be passed.  I have to give my proper gratitude to  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  PAPPAS),  the gentleman  from Texas  (Mr.  SESSIONS),  and  the  gentleman  from Montana (Mr. HILL) for their lead ership, not only on this kind of legisla tion and moving  it  forward, but as  Members of  the  freshman  class and  showing  real  leadership within  the  whole body  in a  bipartisan  fashion,  which I think is going to be the kind of  example for having legislation passed  which is going to be not only helpful to  their constituents but the whole coun try. I appreciate the work that the gen tleman from Texas is doing on the Re(Mr.  sults Act.  I  think we need  to come  back here  for  further  discussion  on  other changes  to  the  IRS  that are  going to help businesses, help individ uals, and help our families back home.  ",1997
200,House,105,-0.569,800,7,Mr. OWENS.," I think it is import~nt  to point out that we are not alone, as  the  gentlewoman  said  before.  The  churches are mobilizing  to  take  the  facts to the American people and to try  to get people to understand the unfair ness in this whole attempt to push peo ple out there, make them work for less  than the minimum wage, with no bene fits. The Washington Post and the New  York Times and a  number of other  newspapers have come out in support  of the President's position. I just want  to read a couple of paragraphs from the  Washington Post  editorial  that  ap peared on Monday, May 19.  ""Wages of Welfare Reform"",  called.  it  is  The President was right to order that wel fare recipients put to work under the terms  of last year's welfare bill be paid the min imum wage. The objecting governors and  other critics are  likewise right when they  say that his decision will throw the bill even  further out of whack than it already was.  What the President basically proved that in  doing the right thing on the wage was how  great a mistake he had made in caving in to  election year pressures, some of them of his  own making, and signing the bill to begin  with. The problem with the welfare part of  this legislation as distinct from the gratu itous cuts that it also imposed in other pro grams for the poor is the mismatch that ex ists between its commands and the resources  it provides  to carry  them out. The basic  command  is  that welfare  recipients work,  but  that's not  something  that  can  be  achieved by the snap of a finger or the wav ing of a wand or it would have happened long  ago. A lot of welfare recipients aren't capa ble of holding down  jobs without an enor mous amount of support. Nor in many cases  are there jobs enough in the private sector to  accommodate them even if they could hold  those jobs down.  That is just a section from an edi torial that appeared in the Washington  Post. There was one also similar  in  Newsday in New York which called for  supporting  the President  as  he  at tempts  to  enforce  the  Fair Labor  Standards Act in respect to welfare re cipients.  I think I said before that one of the  churches that has set an example is the  Lutheran Church where they say that  they will not allow any of their units  that employ people to engage welfare  workers  for  less  than  the minimum  wage. There is a statement they issued  on May 1, at the Workfare Media Con ference  of  the Lutheran Services  in  America. I will quote  just a  few sec tions from that:  The Lutheran Services in America organi zations spend $2.8 billion serving 2 million  people  and  includes  over  3,000  locations  across the United States. We employ workers  at all levels and seek to serve those who are  in need.  When Congress passed welfare reform legis lation which was signed into law on August  22, 1996, we all knew that we would have to  move beyond the rhetoric of personal respon sibility to work opportunity and responsi bility by the employer. If welfare reform is  to happen in this country, then work oppor tunity that includes at the very least the  minimum wage must happen. Rather  than  pitting personal  responsibility  and  struc tural change against one another, we realize  that both kinds of efforts are needed.  As  employers, our umbrella alliance of  service organizations has endorsed the fair  work campaign so that workers have both  sufficiency and sustainability in their lives.  We know from our experience that work that  is  a  job must  include  sufficiency which  means adequate levels of income support so  that people can live dignified lives. It must  also include sustainability. Workers cannot  live in fear of taking other people's jobs nor  be treated differently than others by wages,  benefits or personnel policies. Without suffi ciency and sustainability, welfare legislation  becomes nothing more than rhetoric.  Lutheran Services  in America organiza tions face  the same issues that every non profit and corporate employer  in America  faces. We are working within a budget and  providing services for our clientele. We are  well aware of what it means to be an em ployer and because of this we believe that  workfare  recipients need positive  learning  and training experiences as well as new jobs  and that workfare recipients perform impor tant work that should be valued fairly.  We in Lutheran Services in America chal lenge other employers to join us to be in volved and become responsible in the oppor tunities we give to workers. It is reform for  all of us and it requires all of us to become  a part of this if we ever intend to see the face  of poverty change.  I think that is a forthright statement  by  the Lutheran Church and it is a  challenge to all other religious organi zations  and  nonprofit  organizations  and to corporate America. If we want  to really move people from a situation  of dependency into the mainstream and  provide jobs, then let us define a job as  being a thing that pays the minimum  wage and has all  the other benefits  that go with being a worker in Amer ica.  Ms.  MILLENDER-MCDONALD.  I  might add that the Lutheran Church  seems to be a very new group that is  coming aboard now. It is very healthy  that they do this. But I am sure that  they see  this, as we do, as a  really  moral issue, an issue that smacks in  the face of unfairness. We cannot afford  to allow this type of proposal to come  to American people who  are  trying  their best  to raise  their families,  to  provide shelter for their children, and  to provide an education for them. To  move from a below-subsistence level to  self-sufficiency, we must couch this as  the moral issue it really is. For those  who are spiritual-minded Members, for  those who want to do the right thing,  well, then fight with us to defeat this  very egregious proposal that does not  speak to the fundamental rights of this  country.

202,,105,-0.491,813,7,Mr. SERRANO.," Mr. Speaker, it is with great  joy that I rise today to pay tribute to the Na tional Puerto Rican Parade on its 40 years of  history. The parade, to be held on June 8 in  New York City,  is  the  largest celebration of  Puerto Rican culture in the United States.  Throughout  its  history,  the  parade  has  grown into a national event under the leader ship of  its president, Ramon S. Velez. The  event attracts  thousands of Puerto Ricans  from across the Nation and from Puerto Rico,  as well as many other individuals, their fami lies and children, from all ethnic backgrounds.  This year's parade will honor the  life of a  Puerto Rican hero, Roberto Clemente. Mr.  Clemente's  exceptional  athletic  talent was  paired with his outstanding humanitarian and  charitable contributions to this Nation. He died  25 years ago in an airplane crash, while he  was on a mission  to help  the victims of an  earthquake in Nicaragua.  Mr. Clemente's memory has also been hon ored with  the Congressional Gold Medal, the  highest civilian award bestowed  to an  indi vidual by the U.S. Congress. Clemente's leg acy  is an  inspiration and an example to the  children of Puerto Rico, as well as  those of  this Nation.  As a Puerto Rican, a New Yorker, and a  Member of Congress,  it is an honor to once  again  participate  in  this national event,  in  which  thousands  of  individuals will march  along Fifth Avenue, in Manhattan, in celebra tion of our Puerto Rican heritage and our  achievements in this Nation. Among other ac complishments, Puerto Ricans have been  in9855  strumental in transforming New York City into  a great bilingual city. Moreover,  the parade  has served as a national  landmark  in which  people  from all ethnic groups unite  to com memorate our Nation's glorious immigrant his tory.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I ask  my colleagues to join me in honoring Roberto  Clemente and the National Puerto Rican Pa rade,  in  its celebration of our Puerto Rican  legacy, and  the many contributions made by  the sons and daughters of Puerto Rico to the  greatness of this Nation.

203,,105,-0.631,813,7,Mr. STARK.," Mr. Speaker,  I am pleased to  introduce the Reduction in Medicare Overpay ment Costs Act of 1997, which  imposes an  administrative fee on providers who submit in accurate Medicare claims.  The American taxpayer spends nearly $200  billion on Medicare every year. However, bil lions are lost due to inaccurate claims or over payment. This burdens the Nation with serious  financial costs, threatening the quality of med ical care and endangering the long-term sus tainability of the Medicare Program.  The Reduction  in Medicare Overpayment  Costs Act of 1997, which was  introduced  in  the Senate by Senator MCCAIN, will help elimi nate overpayments by imposing an administra tive fee to offset recovery costs. The purpose  is to discourage doctors from submitting false  or misleading claims and to prevent hospitals  from  excessively  overestimating  Medicare  costs.  The act promotes these purposes  in  three  ways. First, the act imposes an up to 1 per cent administrative  fee  if  the  repayment  is  more than 30 days late. Second, the act will  impose an up to 1 percent administrative fee  if the provider overestimates Medicare needs  by greater than 30 percent. Third, the act re quires the issuance of a report detailing which  services typically result in overpayments.  This act is needed to crack down on incor rect or inflated claim practices in Medicare.  I  urge my fellow members  to vote  in  favor of  this bill to ensure claim accuracy by Medicare  providers.  IN MEMORY OF SERGEANT  MARLIN C. CARROLL  HON.

Born in Atlanta, GA as  Isador Louis Kunianski, he shortened  his last name, but everyone who knew  him called him Sonny. We are honoring  Sonny not only because he was success ful, but because he used the fruits of  his success to help others. One of Son ny's greatest personal drives was  to  help people who wanted to help them selves. His participation  in  the edu cation of hundreds of persons will pro vide a legacy to Sonny. In Sonny's own  words, ""Providing for a person's edu cation is the greatest investment that  I have ever made.""  In 1980, he established  the Mildred  and I.L. Kunian Scholarship Fund at  Georgia Tech  that has helped more  than a hundred students pay their col lege bills. In addition, he founded the  Georgia Tech Satellite Literacy Pro gram, which broadcasts, via satellite  television, adult basic education class es to over 100 classrooms in rural Geor gia. Sonny was instrumental in secur ing funding for the program from Fed eral, State and foundation sources.  Sonny was a graduate of Atlanta's  Boy's High School and  then Georgia  Tech, receiving his degree in textile en gineering in 1934. Sonny played fresh man football for Georgia Tech, was on  the student council and was a member  of several honor societies.

Well, apparently there has been an other change of heart over at the White  House. Apparently the White House ac tually sees value in shutting down the  Government. They believe this so pas sionately that they are willing to block  disaster relief for flood victims in the  Dakotas and Minnesota.  The Gekas-Wynn  provision would  maintain 100 percent of 1997  funding  levels for the Government programs in  the event that the President and Con gress could not agree on appropriations  bills.

210,House,105,0.043,878,7,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Chairman,  the  third  problem with  the  Hamilton  amendment is that it provides no pro tection at all for vital functions of the  agencies that are to be abolished. For  example,  international  public  diplo macy which is carried out by USIA is  extremely important. We spend a lot of  money to support it. We do not want it  to be abused. We do not want all there sources of the USIA to be redirected to  bombard  the American  people with  propaganda in support of the adminis tration or any administration's foreign  policy, and we do not want to spend  U.S.  taxpayer's money churning out  propaganda  to  influence U.S.  public  opinion.  My reorganization language contains  protection for  the integrity of public  diplomacy. We  preserve  the  broad casting board of governors  to make  certain that the Voice of America and  Radio Free Europe and Radio Marti are  not turned into mouthpieces for who ever happens to be running U.S. foreign  policy. The Hamilton amendment,  I  submit, contains no such protections.  In closing,  the bottom line on the  Hamilton amendment  is  this: Do we  want real reorganization of the foreign  agencies or do we want reorganization?  Let us hold the President to his word  [Mr. GIL the  Is  [Mr.  and insist on real reorganization and  vote down the Hamilton amendment.  ",1997

Mr. Chairman,  that  is not correct,  I have not mis represented  his  position. At  other  times,  the gentleman  from Colorado  has sought to kill both Radio and Tele vision Marti. Today he  is  targeting  Television Marti.  Let us see what the report, after we  spent the money to create this panel,  let us see what the findings and rec ommendations were of Mr. Duffey of  USIA with regard to the panel that we  set up in  this Congress and that we  agreed to set up objectively and of dis tinguished membership.  One, the best interests of the United  States are being served by maintaining  television broadcasting to Cuba.  television broad technically sound  Two, maintaining  casting  to Cuba  is  and effective.  Three, Television Marti broadcasting  is consistently being received by a suf ficient Cuban audience to warrant its  continuation.  This is the report of Mr. Duffey, find ings  and  recommendations based on  the panel created by Congress; and here  are the two volumes. But, no, it is not  enough for  the gentleman from Colo rado. Year after year after year my col league  rushes  to  this  floor with his  mission not to increase the receptivity,  the reception, of Television Marti or  Radio Marti for the Cuban people, not  to ask Castro for elections, not to ask  Castro to permit the Cuban people to  get news, but  to kill  this program,  which is meant to get objective news to  the Cuban people. That is the reality of  the effort year after year after year by  the  gentleman  from  Colorado  (Mr.  SKAGGS].  During the height of the cold war,  Mr. Chairman, during the height of the  cold war, at times  the Soviets were  able to achieve 97, 98, 99 percent effec tiveness in their blocking of Radio Lib erty  and Radio Free Europe. What  would have been  the position, what  would have happened  if the attitude  maintained by our distinguished col league from Colorado would have pre vailed at that time in Congress? Oh,  the Soviet Union  is  jamming Radio  Free Europe.  The  Soviet Union  is  achieving 99 percent jamming of Radio  Liberty. So we will throw in the towel,  we will give up.  As my colleague even mentioned, we  are  in  the midst, Mr. Chairman, of  going to UHF, which will increase re ceptivity. But my point is this, we will  go to UHF and we will increase recep tivity despite the fact that Mr. Duffey,  his recommendations, and pursuant to  this  two-volume report,  I have men tioned they are clear enough with re gard  to  the viability of the existing  program of Television Marti.  But  I maintain  the  following: The  American thing to do is, if we do not  increase receptivity sufficiently by the  steps that we are taking now, then we  will take further steps. Just like Mr.  Aristide's voice was able to get to the  Haitian people because they flew a C130, we will do that with Cuba. We will  not throw in the  towel. We will not  surrender. That is not  the American  way.  Approve my amendment and defeat  the amendment of the gentleman from  Colorado [Mr. SKAGGS].  ",1997

216,House,105,0.16,1008,7,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Chair man, I would like to rise in very strong  support  of  the  gentleman's amend ment. The need for various types of aid  to  the Ukraine cannot be underesti mated. Last year, as chairman of the  Helsinki Commission, we held a hear ing on the ongoing crisis in Chernobyl.  The G-7  has  pledged  a  tremendous  amount of aid to shut down the reactor  and  to encase  it in a way  that will  make it less dangerous than it is cur rently, and very little of that money  has been produced over the last couple  of years.  We also heard of the devastating impact of the cancers that are being suf fered by children as a  result of con tamination from  the nuclear fallout,  and  they cannot even begin  to cope  with  the humanitarian medical  and  hospital needs  in  the Ukraine  that  should have been  to  that Chernobyl  disaster.  As the gentleman pointed out, they  have been forthcoming when it comes  to NATO. As partners, as friends, they  have embraced NATO. They have uni laterally  forfeited  the  nuclear war heads on their own soil. That is a grand  gesture of peace in my view, especially  given  the  potential  animosities  be tween themselves and Russia which we  all know exists today.  So I believe while there are problems,  as is acknowledged in this resolution,  dealing with corruption and it is in sisted in this resolution that our eco nomic  interests be  treated  fairly,  I  think the resolution is a good one and  deserves the support, and I would urge  my colleagues to support this amend ment.

So  I  think  that point should be under scored, and that is this is not an ear mark and we  do hope  that  the col leagues, both sides of the aisle, would  support the legislation.  ",1997

June 14, 1997, marks the  50th wedding anniversary for Frank and Kitty  Cacciapaglia. The  couple were married  in  Staunton, VA, before moving to northern Vir ginia, where they raised their five children.  During  the couples first years of marriage,  Frank was a chemist at the Food and Drug  Administration. In 1955, he started at the Pat ent Office and served in numerous special as signments, including Primary Examiner of the  Patent Drug Division, an Administrative Assist ant to the President's Commission on the Pat ent System, Director of  the Patent Office  Speaker's Bureau, Executive Secretary of the  Commerce Technical Advisory Board, and the  Chairman of the Com-Sci Fellowship. Frank is  also an active member of the Phi Alpha Delta  Law Fraternity.  During the 50 years of their marriage, Frank  and Kitty have witnessed the growth of north ern Virginia from a sleepy bedroom community  of the early 1950's to the large urban metropo lis it is today. As a successful realtor, Kitty has  watched and participated in the growth of our  region. She has been an active member of her  community by participating in many clubs and  act.ivities. She was a member of the Northern  Virginia Board of Realtors for 17 years. Kitty  has also been active in politics, serving as a  member of  the  local Republican Women's  Club.  .  Today, Frank and Kitty are  the proud par ents of 5 children and 1 0 grandchildren. They  are enjoying  their  retirement years by win tering in Indialantic, FL, while maintaining their  residence  in Ravenwood Park, near Seven  Corners in Fairfax County. They also spend a  great deal of their time traveling and visiting  with their children and grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues join me,  their neighbors, family and  friends  in wishing  Frank and Kitty Cacciapaglia, Jr., a happy  50th anniversary as  the Cacciapaglias cele brates their special day on June 14, 1997.

Elly has spent most of her life volunteering  her services to people of all ages and walks  of life. She has played a significant role in im proving  many  teenage  girl's  educations  through her work with  the Educational Alli ance. Women have benefited from the organi zations Elly has  founded,  including  the Na tional Women's Political Caucus,  the New  York Women's Forum, the National Women's  Forum, the  International Forum, and the New  York Women's Agenda. Families have been  afforded more options because of  the Day  Care Council of New York, the Day Care and  Child Development Council of America, and  the Child Care Action Campaign, all of which  Elly founded.  Elly has also been a vocal advocate for the  Jewish and elderly communities  through her  trustee position at  the Federation of Jewish  Philanthropies, her founding of the Jewish As sociation  for Services  for  the  Aged  and  through CSCS, as founder and former execu tive director. Among her many other achieve ments, Elly has been commissioner of con sumer affairs of New York City, a television  anchor, and a member of the City Planning  Commission.  Randolph's contributions are equally impres sive. He was almost solely responsible for the  creation of the North General Hospital. Later,  as chairman of the hospital's board, Randolph  fought to save the troubled hospital from finan cial  ruin. He has  remained chairman of  the  board of the hospital, helping  it survive and  provide essential health care  to  the Harlem  community. His leadership at the hospital also  enabled  the construction of a much-needed  new medical facility at North General.  Randolph has dedicated his time to a vari ety of other philanthropic organizations and  led a distinguished  legal and military career.  He is also the former chairman of the board of  Mills College of Education and  the West chester Symphony Orchestra.

220,,105,0.154,1060,7,Mr. HOUGHTON.," Mr. Speaker, I am joined  by my colleague, Mr. LEVIN  in introducing leg islation to simplify and reform our current inter national tax laws. As all of you know, we are  in a period of fundamental  re-examination of  the  Internal Revenue Code. One of the most  complicated and  impenetrable areas of  the  Code and most in need of change is the for eign area. Our  international  trade  laws have  June 4, 1997  gotten ahead of our tax laws for this area. We  consider our bill  to be a down payment on  needed changes in this area.  The focus of the  legislation is to put some  rationalization to the international tax area. In  general, the bill seeks in modest but important  ways to: (1) simplify this overly complex area,  especially the  foreign  tax credit and  the var ious antideferral mechanism;  (2) encourage  exports; (3) provide incentives for performance  of R&D in the U.S.; (4) enhance U.S. competi tiveness in other industrialized countries. And  it seeks to achieve these objectives in a rev enue-conscious manner.  For some period of time, the Committee on  Ways and Means has been considering issues  relating  to  international competitiveness and  proper  taxation of U.S. based multinational  corporations.  In 1991, the committee held 10  days of public hearings on  the  issues:  inter national competitiveness  including  tax, trade,  education,  technology  and  other  important  issues affecting the nation's ability to compete  internationally.  In 1992, two former members of the Ways  and Means Committee, Messrs. Rostenkowski  and Gradison,  introduced H.R. 5270.  It at tempted to address many of the same issues  included in our bill. More recently, the Depart ment of Treasury introduced a new tax sim plification package which  included provisions  similar to those contained in our legislation.  Now as we begin the process of re-exam ining in fundamental ways our income tax sys tem, we believe  it imperative to address the  area of  international  taxation.  In an  Internal  Revenue Code stuffed with eye-glazing com plexity, there is probably no area that contains  as many difficult and complicated  rules as  international taxation.  Neither one of us is under any illusion that  the measure which we introduced removes all  complexity or breaks bold  new conceptual  ground. We believe, however, that the enact ment of this legislation would be a significant  step  in  the  right direction. The  legislation  would enhance the ability of America to con tinue to be the preeminent economic force in  the world. If our economy is to continue to cre ate jobs for its citizens, we must ensure that  the  foreign provisions of the U.S.  income tax  law do not stand in the way.  The law as now constituted frustrates the le gitimate goals and  objectives of American  business and erects artificial and unnecessary  barriers  to U.S. competitiveness.  In addition,  the law stands as a monument to the fact that  the conceptual complexity of man as applied  to the Internal Revenue Code knows no limits.  Neither  the  largest U.S. based multinational  companies nor the  Internal Revenue Service  is in a position to administer and interpret the  mind numbing complexity of many of the  for eign provisions. Why not then move  toward  creating a set of international tax rules which  taxpayers can understand, and  the govern ment can administer?  In  summary,  therefore  the  proposed  changes we  believe  represent a creditable  package and a down payment on  further re form in the international tax area. We ask you  to  join us,  in  this bipartisan effort, by sup porting our legislation.  ",1997
221,Senate,105,0.338,1164,7,Mr. SANTORUM.," Mr. President,  in  1979, Congress created an award which  is specifically designed for young peo ple. This special program, the Congres sional Award, recognizes young Ameri cans who make commitments to com munity service and self-improvement. I  would like to take a  few moments of  Senate business  to discuss  this pro gram and the important role it plays in  promoting volunteerism.  The Congressional Award is a non partisan,  public-private  partnership  which teaches young people that they  can make a difference in their commu nities. The program is noncompetitive.  Participants set individual goals based  on their own abilities. Once these goals  are achieved, they can earn bronze, sil ver, or gold medals. I would emphasize  that  each  Congressional  Award  is  earned-not won. Any 14to 23-year old,  regardless  of  their  life  cir cumstances  or physical  and mental  abilities, can earn the award.  Mr. President,  this program  truly  promotes  community  service.  Since  the first award was presented in 1982,  1.5 million hours have been attributed  to volunteerism. In the last 12 months  alone, recipients of the Congressional  Award  throughout  the  country per formed more than 63,000 hours of com munity service. Some examples of the  volunteer projects include assisting el derly shut-ins, distributing food for the  needy, producing a handbook of volun teer opportunities at the United Way,  and donating a narcotics K-9 to asher iff's department.  Recently, I have chartered the Con gressional Award Program in my own  State, along with the other members of  the Pennsylvania delegation. I encour age each of my colleagues to promote  this valuable program. The Congres sional Award  benefits  everyone  in volved-the participants,  their adult  ",1997

We are pleased that we could have  Reverend Kummernuss here  today  to  join in our opening and also  to give  him an opportunity to see where his  son has spent his past several months.  If we have any errands that we need  run, just summon him. Since Reverend  Kummernuss has the privileges of the  floor today, he also has the privilege of  asking Matt to do his errands.

223,House,105,-0.459,1203,7,Mrs. CLAYTON.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  in  support of  the budget  resolution  agreement. An agreement  is a  corn promise, a settlement, a consensus. An  agreement does not necessarily provide  all that we want but it does provide  some things we want.  This agreement is no different from  that. It does provide a balanced budget  in 5 years that is good for the Nation,  but it continues  to have very harsh  provisions  that allow access  to  food  stamps  for  hungry  people  only  3  months out of 3 years. That provision  will prove to be bad for the Nation.  The  agreement  provides  an  addi tional $16 billion over 5 years which  will mean health insurance for 5 mil lion children who are currently unin sured, and that  is good. These addi tional moneys will help us, certainly,  to have healthy children.  But the agreement does not extend  health coverage for another 5 million  children  that would be  left out, Mr.  Speaker,  and, worse,  the agreement  hurts hospitals in rural communities,  although  I  know  that  the chairman  does not think so. The agreement hurts  hospitals  in  rural communities  that  face  increases  in  their Medicaid dis proportionate share hospital payments.  We must work on  this  issue beyond  this conference report.  This agreement is good for education,  a national priority. The $35 billion in vestment in education tax cuts, the in crease of $300 in Pell grants and the ex pansion of Head Start go a long way to  feed the minds of our American chil dren.  This agreement is also charitable to  this Nation's hard-working  families.  The $500 per child tax credit, the wel fare-to-work credit, and the establish ment of additional empowerment zones  and enterprise communities are impor tant. Those will go a long way to boost  our economy. But the agreement is bad  for those who want to work and cannot  find a job.  I do look forward in the Committee  on Agriculture next week  to passing  language governing the $1.5 billion in crease in funds to allow States to ex empt up  to 15 percent of their food  stamp load. But those funds and the $3  million in additional funds for welfare to-work simply will not go far enough.  Many who  find  themselves without  work, without income, many without  ",1997

225,House,105,0.54,1242,7,Mr. COX of California.," Mr. Speaker, I regret fully must oppose  this spending  legislation,  which commits  taxpayers  to  foot  the bill  for  dozens of special-interest items having noth ing to do with disaster relief.  First,  the House-Senate  compromise  bill  costs $200 million more than the House bill.  Second,  it  includes $262.2 million  in non emergency spending, an  increase of $150.4  million over the House passed version.  Third, it includes such nonemergency items  as: $35 million  for the Advanced Technology  Program of the National Institute for Standards  and Technology unoer the Commerce Depart ment; $2 million  for  the Commission on  the  Advancement of Law Enforcement; $3 million  for Ogden, UT,  in anticipation of  the 2002  Winter Olympics; $650,000  for  the National  Commission on the Cost of Higher Education;  $101 million in education grants; $33.5 million  for Botanic Garden Conservatory in DC; $15  million for health research; $1.9 million for the  Denver Summit of  the G-8, June  2Q-22,  1997; $16 million to the Customs Service for  the Automated Targeting System; $5.383 mil lion  to  the U.S. Postal Service  to subsidize  free and reduced rate mail; $12.3 million for a  multistory parking lot in a Cleveland, OH, Vet erans' Administration  facility; $1 million ""spe cial purpose grant"" of which $500,000 goes to  a parking  lot and $500,000 for renovation of  the Paramount Theater  in Ashland, KY; and  $30.2 million for HUD Demonstration Act pur poses.  This  is  supposed  to  be  an  emergency  measure  to help  flood and disaster victims.  The inclusion of such expenditures indicates it  is not.  In  the exercise of fiscal prudence,  I  must therefore vote ""no"".  Mr. McDADE. Mr. Speaker, I  rise in  support of the conference report to ac company H.R. 1469, the emergency sup plemental appropriations bill for fiscal  year 1997. This important legislation is  key to the long-term rehabilitation of  communities  devastated  by  natural  disasters across this great country. It  is also essential to ensure our contin ued military preparedness through the  replenishment of critical defense ac counts.  Mr. Speaker,  the Energy and Water  Development chapter of the emergency  supplemental appropriations bill rep resents  the dedicated efforts of Mem bers from both sides of the aisle and  from both sides of the Hill to deliver  needed assistance to those areas of our  country which have suffered the crip pling effects  of uncontrolled  floods.  From  the Pacific Northwest  to  the  Ohio Valley,  from the Deep South to  the Great Plains,  floodwaters  have  been especially furious during the past  year. We have all been deeply touched  by the heart-wrenching images of dis located families, destroyed homes, and  inundated  cities.  Recognizing  the  emergency  nature  of  these  con sequences,  the Subcommittees on En ergy  and Water Development  have  acted expeditiously, responsibly, and in  good  faith  to help  flood victims get  back on their feet.  The conference agreement  includes  $585 million for the Corps of Engineers  and $7.4 million for the Bureau of Rec lamation  to  address  flood  related  needs. These desperately needed funds  will support the rehabilitation of lev ees, the repair of Federal flood control  works, and the performance of emer gency dredging. These public works are  more  than mere  infrastructure;  they  represent a foundation for the contin ued vitality, protection, and economic  viability of the towns, villages, and cit ies  that constitute a  free and strong  America.  In order to help pay for emergency  disaster  assistance,  the  conference  agreement includes a rescission of $11.2  million from  the Energy Supply, Re search and Development account of the  Department of Energy. Another rescis sion of $11.3 million from the Western  Area Power Administration will also  help offset  the costs of this supple mental bill.  Mr. Speaker,  I would  like  to con gratulate and  thank  the members of  the  Subcommittee  on  Energy  and  Water Development for their dedicated  efforts in producing this critical legis lation. I am especially appreciative of  the efforts of  the  ranking minority  Member, the Honorable VIC FAZIO. His  cooperation and hard work have been  indispensable, and  I  look  forward  to  continuing our bipartisan working re lationship as we move on to the consid eration of the regular appropriations  bill for fiscal year 1998.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to  support the conference report ..  ",1997
226,House,105,-0.513,1242,7,Mrs. MINK of Hawaii.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in  firm opposition to a ban in the fiscal year 1997  Supplemental Appropriations Conference Re port that disallows the use of statistical sam pling in the 200 census. We must not dictate  to the experts in the U.S. Census Bureau how  they are to conduct this most important, Con stitution mandated count of our population.  Furthermore,  this ban would  ignore the need  to restore accuracy to the census by account ing for groups grossly undercounted in the last  decennial census-minorities and  low-income  individuals.  The bill language states, ""the proposed use  of statistical sampling by  the Bureau of the  Census exposes  taxpayers  to  the unaccept able risk of an inaccurate, invalid, and uncon stitutional census."" Rather, a ban on the use  of sampling poses this unacceptable risk and  increases the cost to taxpayers  for the 2000  census.  All evidence reviewed from the 1990 census  clearly demonstrates the inaccuracy of a per sistent undercount. The Census Bureau ac knowledges  that  this  last decennial  count  failed  to  include more  than 4 million  resi dents-the highest undercount ever recorded.  These  included a disproportionate number of  racial and ethnic minorities  in  this country.  Hundreds of thousands of Asian-Pacific-Ameri cans were not counted by census, at an esti mated rate of 2.3 percent. For Hispanics this  rate was 5.0 percent and  for African-Ameri cans, 4.4 percent. It is inexcusable that these  rates were two times, five times and four times  greater than  the undercount for white Ameri cans. Inaccuracy to this degree itself is an in validation.  As to the claim of unconstitutionality, a letter  of May 8, 1997, from Census Bureau Director  D. Martha Farnsworth Riche to Speaker GING RICH recapped three options from the U.S. De partment of Justice under  the Carter, Bush,  and Clinton administrations: ""All three opinions  concluded  that the Constitution and  relevant  statutes permit the use of sampling in the de cennial census. Every federal court that has  addressed the  issue had held  that the Con stitution and federal statutes allow samp.ling.""  the clear constitutionality of the use of census  sampling has been  stated  repeatedly,  in a  nonpartisan manner.  Sampling opponents further claim  that this  new methodology would only be to the benefit  ",1997

252,,105,0.162,1281,7,Mrs. ROUKEMA.," Mr. Speaker, I rise in rec ognition of a highly respected, singularly effec tive, and most popular educator, Catherine M.  Marino. Cathy Marino is retiring this June as  principal of the Henrietta Hawes Elementary  School in Ridgewood, NJ, after a long and dis tinguished career as a highly respected and  beloved teacher, spanning three decades.  Cathy Marino, one of my closest and dear est personal friends, is a dedicated and caring  educator who has committed her life to help ing young people and truly has the best inter ests of children at heart, She has been in the  forefront of innovation and progress, improving  the standards of public education at every  turn. As a former teacher myself, I can tell you  she has always put  the  individualized social  and educational needs of each student first.  She has been at  the cutting edge of edu cational  innovation and is truly ""a teacher for  all seasons."" She always put children first.  Cathy's career began as a teacher of men tally retarded children at Travis Air Force Base  in California, immediately after her graduation  from Russell Sage College in Troy, NY, with a  bachelor's degree  in elementary education.  She  later worked with blind, deaf, and phys ically handicapped children in Colorado before  returning to the East Coast in 1970, as a spe cial education teacher in Saratoga, NY.  Cathy came to New Jersey in 1972, as a re source  room  teacher at Tenakill Elementary  School in Closter. She served at Tenafly Mid dle School as a special education teacher be fore  joining the Ridgewood school system  in  197 4, as a first grade teacher at Hawes Ele mentary.  Cathy  taught  first grade until 1977, when  she switched to kindergarten and split her time  between  the Hawes, Glen, and Willard ele mentary schools. In September 1996, she re turned  to Hawes Elementary School as prin cipal.  As principal, Cathy has been responsible for  supervision of planning, development  impleEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  mentation, and evaluation of all school pro grams and activities under a site-based man agement structure. She supervised 42 certifi cated and 8 non-certificated staff members,  provided leadership for staff development and  community  relations,  prepared  and  imple mented budgets,  led  efforts  to  accomplish  school and district goals, and supervised mon itoring of students' social, emotional, and aca demic progress.  In addition, she has worked as an adjunct  professor at William Paterson College and as  a consultant on educational videos for young  children.  Cathy's commitment cannot be  fully con veyed by her employment history alone, how ever. To begin with, she believes strongly that  learning  never  ends  and  has  constantly  worked to extend her own education. In addi tion to her bachelor of arts degree in elemen tary education from Russell Sage College, she  holds a master's degree in learning disabilities  from Fairleigh Dickinson University, where she  graduated summa cum laude. She has taken  graduate courses at William Paterson College,  Syracuse University,  the University of Auck land and Adelphia University. She has at tended lectures, workshops and other special  programs at Harvard and Yale universities.  Recognizing the need to prepare others to  carry on after her retirement, Cathy has been  active  in sharing her knowledge with  fellow  and future educators through a variety of fo rums. For more than a dozen years, she has  served on panels at the annual Renaissance  Weekend Program in Hilton Head, SC, includ ing the landmark ""A Nation at Risk"" panel with  president Clinton. She has spoken at Colum bia University,  the State University of New  York, and before the New Jersey Kindergarten  Teachers Association, to name a few. She has  led countless staff development programs  in  the Ridgewood school system and  in other  school systems as well. She  is the author of  The Wonderful World  of  Kindergarten:  A  Handbook for Parents and Connections, Prob lem Solving and Thinking Skills  for Young  Children.  Cathy has been  the  recipient of a  large  number of awards and honors,  including  the  Governor's Award  tor Outstanding Teachers.  She was chosen as a member of the Presi dent's National Teachers Advisory Council  during the Reagan administration.  Throughout her years of  innovative  teach ing, Cathy was always looking ahead to keep  education contemporary and  relevant  to  the  current needs of families and the community she was a true pioneer.  Recognizing  the  changing  responsibilities  that challenged working  families and putting  her knowledge of the developmental needs of  children to use, Cathy in 1982 founded New  Jersey's  first child care program  for  infants  and toddlers.  In partnership with Valley Hos pital, this school-based program was open to  workers in the local community. Cathy staffed  . the  facility with  highly  qualified  personnel  trained to serve the needs of children from the  earliest months of  life. This was not merely  ""custodial"" child care. This was an early child hood education center before most commu nities were aware of these innovational needs  and  long  before  the  Federal Government  adopted Early Start as an  adjunct  to  the  10323  Head  and  well-established  much-heralded  Start.  Recently,  extensive  documentation  has  been advanced by  the National  Institute of  Mental Health and other research centers that  proves the importance of proper care and de velopment during early childhood. Proper nur turing during the first few months can improve  IQ and academic performance later, for exam ple. Positive playtime activities lead to an im proved ability to make friends and function so cially as an adult.  So you can see why I call Cathy not only a  role model for American educators but ""an ed ucator for all seasons.""  Cathy and her husband, Ben, make  their  home in Ridgewood. They have a loving and  close-knit  family  that  includes  their children,  Michael,  Christopher,  and  Stephen,  and  grandchildren, Mitchell and Katherine.  Members of the Ridgewood school system  staff, members of the community and count less former students and their parents all have  fond memories and are deeply indebted to the  dedication of this outstanding educator. I wish  her much-deserved health and happiness  in  her retirement. But, knowing Cathy's inquiring  mind and sense of dedication  to children,  I  doubt that this will be a true retirement.  I am  certain she will continue to find ways to serve  children and make our world a better place for  all.  STATEMENT OF THE HON.  EARL  POMEROY  ON  HOUSE  CONCUR RENT RESOLUTION 84  HON. JOHN R. KASICH  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 5, 1997  ",1997
253,,105,0.314,1281,7,Mr. KASICH.," Mr. Speaker,  I am submitting  the views of Representative EARL POMEROY  for  inclusion  in  the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  Representative POMEROY submitted his views  in a timely manner and in accordance with the  provisions of House Rule XI, clause 2(1)(5).  Unfortunately, the Government Printing Office  inadvertently omitted his name from the views  that he submitted, which were printed on page  123 of House Report 1 05-1 00,  the report to  accompany House Concurrent Resolution 84.  To  remedy this oversight,  the views of Rep resentative POMEROY are submitted for publi cation in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD:  THE HONORABLE EARL POMEROY FISCAL YEAR  1998  CONGRESSIONAL  BUDGET RESOLUTION  ADDITIONAL VIEW&-MAY 17, 1997  I want  to commend  the Chairman and  Ranking Member of the Committee for their  outstanding efforts in forging this bipartisan  balanced budget agreement. I am pleased to  support  this agreement  that balances  the  federal budget in five years while protecting  important national priorities including the  education of our children and quality health  care for our senior citizens. Importantly, the  agreement also provides tax relief for middle  income working families.  While I support this budget resolution, I  am seriously concerned about  the  lack of  funding allocated  to  the discretionary ac count for agriculture, function 350. The reso lution assumes a cut of $1.4 billion below a  freeze  for  agriculture over  the next  five  ",1997
254,,105,0.16,1294,7,Mr. SMITH of New Jersey.," Mr. Speaker,  today marks  the 50th anniversary of  former  Secretary of State George Marshall's com mencement address to the graduating class at  Harvard University. In that address, Secretary  Marshall laid the foundation for the historic for eign  aid  program  that would  come  to be  known as the Marshall plan.  Mr. Speaker, most historians would agree  that the Marshall plan was the most dramati cally successful peacetime foreign policy  im plemented by  the United States. However,  when our Nation moved so swiftly and sin cerely  to assist  the war-ravaged  landscape,  economy and political structure of Europe  in  the late 1940's, it also marked the beginning  of the United States' role as worldwide peace keeper and protector of democracy.  Beginning with  the Yalta Conference  in  1945-when  some  argued  that  President  Franklin Delano Roosevelt had given away  Eastern Europe  to Joseph Stalin-the world  entered a new arena of confrontation unlike  any before. When Winston Churchill  referred  to the borders of the Eastern Bloc Communist  countries as the ""Iron Curtain"", the stage had  been set for the cold war.  The Revolutionary War brought us our inde pendence; the Civil War gave us our national  identity; the First World War made us players  in  the  international arena; and  the Second  World War turned America into a superpower.  For  those veterans, there can be no doubt.  Their participation  in  the combat  theater en sures  that their selflessness and contribution  to our great Nation will never be overlooked or  be taken for granted.  Yet, Mr. Speaker, for  those veterans who  gave just as selflessly to this country, but may  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  have never looked directly into the eyes of the  enemy, there is honor for them as well. From  the policy of containment in the late 1940's to  detente  in  the 1970's to confrontation  in  the  early 1980's to the revolution in 1991, the vet erans of the cold war stared unwaveringly into  the depths of communism, and  they did not  blink  for an  instant. Rather,  these veterans  made it manifestly clear that democracy-that  government by, of, and for the people-would  be secure not only for America, but also for  the entire world.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker,  from Capt. Gary  Powers to every sailor who stood ready off the  shores of Cuba, I salute all cold war veterans,  and thank them for their service to our great  Nation.  CONGRATULATIONS  TO  THE  SOUTHWEST  GUILFORD  IDGH  SCHOOL WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM  HON. HOWARD COBLE  OF NORTH CAROLINA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 5, 1997  ",1997
255,,105,0.52,1294,7,Mr. COBLE.," Mr. Speaker, this year, wom en's high school soccer was extremely excit ing in the Sixth District of North Carolina. For  the second  time  in 3 years, the Southwest  Guilford High School women's soccer  team  captured  the 1 A/2A/3A State championship.  Southwest Guilford High School,  located just  outside of Greensboro, NC, secured the wom en's soccer state championship with a 1-Q win  over Charlotte Catholic High School.  This win could not have come at a better  time. Just 2 days before the title contest, two  Southwest classmates Emily Parker and Shar on Thoma were tragically killed  in a car acci dent which also injured two others. However,  the Cowgirls resolved to attain victory, despite  their sorrow. The girls dedicated the game to  the memory of  the  two students who were  killed and to those who remain injured.  This victory momentarily helped the team to  forget about the loss of their friends and class mates. But this year's win most certainly made  them forget about the loss they had last sea son against Northwest Guilford  in a playoff  game. At the final moment, the team pulled to gether to win the one game that could destroy  the memory of last year's defeat.  To cap an impressive 24-1 record this sea son, Freshman Sheconda Douglas scored the  game-winning goal in the last 4 minutes of the  championship match.  Ironically, the Cowgirls  won  the game after  rebounding a Charlotte  Catholic free kick.  Senior  Kelly  Allison,  named  the MVP,  played an integral part in the game and cred ited the win  to hard work and the realization  of goals the team had set earlier in the sea son. Allison, a defensive player helped to cap ture the win by sticking close to Catholic play er Carrie Hughes, 36-goal scorer this season.  Kelly Allison's two sisters Abbie and Bree,  also contributed to the successful season, en suring that the game would be a family affair.  Southwest players Catey Conner, Shannon  Ratcliff, Kristen Carter, Charlotte Acker, Mere dith Ledwell, Brooks Gonzalez, Cori Ray, Erin  Moran, Brianna Balliet, Holly Hunter, Lauren  June 5, 1997  Gaster, Shana  Stephens,  Ashley  Trexler,  Karen Davis, and Kathleen Haver all aided in  Southwest Guilford's successful season and  their  final victory against Charlotte Catholic.  Overseeing this group are head coach Chris  Glover, coach Eric Lewis, managers Ken Mur ray and Josh Edwards, athletic director Rich ard Kemp, and principal Wayne Tuggel.  On behalf of the citizens of the Sixth District  of North Carolina, we congratulate Southwest  Guilford's women's soccer  team  for winning  the State 1 A/2A/3A championship.  REPORT FROM INDIANA-MISTY  AND MYRA YOUNG  HON. DAVID M. MciNTOSH  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, June 5, 1997  Mr. MciNTOSH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  give my report from Indiana  In the Second Congressional District of Indi ana  there are so many good people. Good  people doing good things.  In my book, these  special  individuals are Hoosier Heroes. Hoo sier Heroes because they have dedicated their  lives to helping others. Mr. Speaker, Myra and  Misty Young of Pendleton, IN, are Hoosier He roes. They are proof that there is no age too  young to make our community a better place.  Myra and Misty bring  joy and kindness  to  the seniors of the nursing homes in Pendleton,  IN. These young girls share with seniors love  and friendship. They put smiles on their faces.  These Pendleton Elementary School students,  and other kids from throughout Madison Coun ty, are no strangers to lending a helping hand  where one  is needed. After school and on  weekends, they volunteer their time at Pet-a Pal, an organization  that livens the spirits  in  nursing homes throughout Pendleton. Dressed  in costume, these wonderful girls and their ca nine friends entertain seniors with cheerful pa rades and dances.  Twelve-year-old Myra  is an excellent stu dent. She volunteers her time to the nursing  homes so she can share her youth with oth ers.  In  her  free  time  she  enjoys  playing  volleyball. Today she is recovering from a de bilitating ankle  injury. When asked about the  time spent at  the senior homes, Myra will  humbly confess that ""ifs really fun, and neat  to see  the peoples' expressions when we  bring the dogs in.""  Misty, only 7 years old, is an honor student  and a member of the Pendleton Garden Club  in addition to her efforts with Pet-a-Pal. During  Misty's first  few  times at Pet-a-Pal she was  quiet and withdrawn during the parades, a bit  fearful of her role in the events. One day, she  and her canine companion both dressed as  brides in wedding gowns and became the hit  of the parade.  During a silence  in  the event, Misty threw  the leash over her head and danced in circles  with her dog in sync not far behind. The audi ence erupted with pleasant laughter and were  warmed by Misty's adorable youthfulness and  innocence. Misty now  tells her grandmother  Julane Shepard that she wants to go everyday  to entertain, make new friends, and laugh.  ",1997

258,Senate,105,0.429,1346,7,Mr. GREGG.," Mr. President,  I  rise  today in memory of Nancy Jean Coutu,  a Peace Corps volunteer who was mur dered by native tribesmen on April 9,  1996, while serving as a Peace Corps  volunteer in Madagascar.  Nancy was a young woman whose life  was dedicated  to helping others. She  was born and raised iii New Hampshire  and attended  the University of New  Hampshire. She was full of joy and giv ing and her desire  to help others  is  what brought her  to  join  the Peace  Corps in 1994. She spent almost 2 years  living in the village of Baraketa where  she helped the villagers build a school  and rebuild a small hospital. She also  pursued her  interest  in  the environ ment by studying  the  local ecology.  Her tragic death was a shock to every one who knew and loved her, including  the people of Madagascar whose gov ernment posthumously awarded her a  knighthood for her work in their coun try.  Nancy's family and friends have cho sen to honor her memory by creating a  memorial to her on a beautiful maple shaded knoll  in Elm Brook Park  in  West Hopkinton, NH. During the sum mers of 1992 and 1993, while a student  at the University of New Hampshire,  Nancy worked as a park ranger at Elm  Brook. There  she  spent many hours  working to expand her knowledge and  interest  in  the environment and  to  share her love of nature with visitors  to the park. On Sunday, June 15, 1997,  the memorial, with  its  large granite  stone and plaque, and an oil painting of  Nancy done by her mother, will be  dedicated. In addition, because she was  particularly interested in helping the  handicapped to enjoy the many experi ences  offered  by  the  outdoors,  the  park's wheelchair accessible elevated  wildlife viewing observation deck, fish ing platform, and nature trail will also  be dedicated to Nancy.  Nancy Coutu set a shining example of  what can be accomplished through pub lic service and voluntarism and I would  like to  join with her family,  friends,  and all those whose lives she touched  with her love, in commending her for  her courage and willingness to give of  herself in order to make life better for  others.

My col league Senator D' AMATO and I call him  ""the Dean""  of  the New York  cor respondents  in our Nation's capital  and, indeed, he is one of the Nation's  most sagacious and indefatigable jour nalists.

260,Senate,105,-0.362,28,13,Mr. DURBIN.," Senator LEVIN will be  offering a  sense-of-the-Senate amend ment  that complements  this amend ment. I want to commend him for his  hard work in this area since 1979 when  he succeeded in instituting directives  aimed at  increasing  the number  of  military  organ  donors.  Senator  DEWINE's staff has also been most help ful in suggesting modifications to im prove this amendment and we have in corporated all  their suggestions  into  this amendment.  More than 50,000 Americans are wait ing for organ transplants and hundreds  of thousands more need  tissue  trans plants. Every year, thousands die need lessly due  to  lack of donors.  In 1996  alone, 3,916 people on  the  transplant  waiting  list died because no organs  were available for  them. Nearly one fifth of all heart and liver transplant  candidates die while waiting  for or gans. Every 18 minutes another person  is added to the waiting list for organs.  Each day, eight people die because an  organ was not available. Yet since 1986,  hospitals that participate in the Medi care or Medicaid Program are required  to have in place policies to offer eligi ble families the option of organ and tis sue donation.

262,House,105,-0.382,106,13,Ms. ESHOO.," Madam  Speaker,  8  months ago  the President asked  the  Congress  to have a campaign finance  reform bill ready for him to sign by the  Fourth of July,  Independence Day.  I  think  perhaps  the President  should  have then specified the year, 1997. What  has happened? Nothing. No hearings,  no markups, no bill, no reform, no ac tion.  Our campaign finance system is bro ken. It is out of control. Hearings and  news reports continue to expose a cor rosive and insidious system, a system  that has cast a shadow of public dis respect, of doubt, of disillusionment,  not only on our system, but on this in stitution. And we know that we can do  much better.  In fact, the American people insist on  it; and they are right. They are ahead  of  this system, and  they know  that  something can be done.  Yet despite  the hearings,  the head lines and the public pressure, the ma jority continues to defer action, deny a  vote  and  disregard  the will  of  the  American people.  We insist that a campaign finance re form bill to ban soft money be brought  to  the floor of the House before  the  Congress adjourns this year.  LET US FIX WHAT IS BROKEN  ",1997
263,House,105,0.217,119,13,Mr. PORTER.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words, and I rise to oppose the amend ment.  Mr. Chairman, we have heard a  lot  during  the discussion on this amend ment about moving funds from Federal  enforcement to Federal compliance as sistance. I have to tell my friend from  Indiana and my colleague from across  the border in Wisconsin that that is ex actly what I have been doing as chair man of the subcommittee for the last 3  years. We  have  consistently moved  more money  into  compliance assist ance and taken the money from F'ed eral enforcement and made a better  balance.  The gentleman from Arizona said we  have got to find balance in this. How  do we find balance? Do we do it by sim ply saying, ""I know what balance is?""  ''Balance is more my way than anyone  else's way?"" No, we find it by sitting  down between majority and minority  and working out where there is an ac ceptable balance. In doing so, we must  recognize  that  the minority  has  a  greater concern with those businesses  that violate the law and do so, as some  do,  intentionally. We have a greater  concern with trying to find a coopera tive way to have business and govern ment work together.  I believe that we have found, through  the process of negotiation,  the right  balance in this account. We have  in creased money for compliance assist ance overall by 22 percent, and the in crease for enforcement  is only 1 per cent in the bill.  This funding decision has moved us  further in the direction of compliance  assistance. We have done so consist ently over the last 3 years. I think the  amendment is simply one that would  do exactly what  I believe cannot be  done, and that is  lose  the bipartisan  basis upon which this bill has reached  this point and eventually, I would be  afraid, lose the bill entirely.  I would say to the gentleman that we  have done what the gentleman wants  us to do philosophically and that this  amendment can only provide mischief  and  lead  to  the bill being defeated,  which I think would be a terrible mis take.

Everything that had a ""de fense"" in it was going to have a leg up  in passage. The Defense Education Act.  In the Clinton era,  the key phrase  was ""change."" We all campaigned as  agents of change.  Lately, family values has become a  universal aspiration. We all stand four square  for  family values. One  family  value  is parental  responsibility. Any  program  that  deliberately  bypasses  parents to provide birth control devices  to minors, in my judgment, is an egre gious violation of family values.  It is  little  less  than  legitimating  promiscuity. What kind of a lesson do  we teach? We teach youngsters, young  ",1997
268,House,105,0.492,158,13,Mr. ISTOOK.,"  I appreciate  the com ments of the gentleman from Delaware  [Mr. CASTLE].  I  think when we  talk  about some parents being responsible  and  some parents not being  respon sible, we know it is true. I believe the  vast majority of parents are  respon sible. So much of the concern is that in  order to provide what we see as help to  those who have irresponsible parents,  that standard is applied in the case of  responsible parents and provides an in ducement, an  incentive,  if you will,  that can help draw their children into  that. It is the fact that the current law  does not distinguish.  ",1997

270,,105,-0.578,223,13,Mr. STOKES.," Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  support of H.R. 2159, which provides foreign  operations appropriations for fiscal year 1998.  This $12.3 billion bill has aspects which give  cause  for  reservation, but overall, addresses  critical funding  for areas that are consequen tial  for  the  global  interests of  the United  States.  There is no doubt that with the end of the  cold war America now reigns supreme as the  world's only superpower. Over the past sev eral years, our foreign policy has undergone a  massive undertaking to adjust to a post-cold war world which has allowed us to maintain a  better balance of our domestic and foreign in terests.  The world faces the proliferation of dangers  that have  the possibility  to grow unchecked  without our leadership. These dangers include  terrorism and extremism, acquisition of weap ons by hostile regimes, poverty and disease,  economic  instability, narcotics  trafficking, and  global environmental hazards. American na tional security eventually becomes an issue as  these problems spread across the globe.  President Clinton's  foreign  operations  re quest reasonably addressed the overseas in terests of the United States by maintaining our  obligations  to  our  friends  and  the world's  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  neediest people. H.R. 2159 still falls $4.6 bil lion short of President Clinton's request, but is  still  an  improvement over  recent  years  in  which devastating cuts were proposed by the  Republican majority. The overall funding level  of H.R. 2159 is near that of fiscal year 1997.  This bill provides $7.4 billion  for bilateral  economic assistance, $3.3 billion  for military  assistance, $1.1  billion  for multilateral eco nomic assistance, and $451 million for export  assistance.  Foreign aid  is no giveaway. This  is dem onstrated by the dollars that work as an effec tive means of developing and expanding U.S.  export markets. In fact, the recipients of U.S.  foreign aid constitute the fastest growing mar ket  for U.S. exports. Over  the past decade,  our exports to developing countries have more  than doubled  from $71  to $180 billion. This  valuable  trade  results  in  thousands of much  needed jobs for American workers.  Mr. Speaker, a particular element of this bill  that I strongly support is the total of $3.1 bil lion in aid to Israel. This funding level consists  of $1.8 billion  for  foreign military  financing  [FMF] grants, and $1.2 billion  in economic  support fund [ESF] assistance. H.R. 2159 also  expresses  the sense of Congress  that Arab  League  countries  should  immediately  re nounce their resumption of the boycott against  Israel and its trading partners, and calls on the  President to consider a country's participation  in  the boycott when determining whether  to  sell United States weapons to the country.  I am also encouraged by the House adop tion of an amendment which doubles the level  of the African Development Fund  [AfDF],  to  fully fund the President's request of $50 mil lion. This fund addresses poverty reduction in  sub-Saharan Africa through loans to borrowing  countries. Areas of focus  include agriculture,  heath care, education, micro-enterprise, and  basic infrastructure. This funding plays an im portant role  to a region  in need at  relatively  small cost.  Contrary  to  critics of  international assist ance,  foreign aid constitutes less than 1 per cent of the U.S. budget. This small investment  is  leveraged  further by a public-private part nership involving several hundred U.S.-based  charitable organizations.  Greatly  troubling  to me about H.R. 2159,  however,  is  the  inclusion of highly restrictive  provisions to international family planning as sistance  to developing countries. These  re strictions, which unreasonably strike at repro ductive rights as  they pertain  to current  law,  will draw a veto  if they are contained in  this  bill upon arrival to the President. The Senate  has not  included such abortion  restrictions,  and it is my hope that the House restrictions  will be removed in conference.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, because of dra matic changes  in world politics,  the U.S.  is  faced with a tremendous opportunity to direct  funds  to relieve problems here at home and  help improve the lives of our friends overseas.  H.R. 2159 is a reasonable step toward the lat ter, and it is my hope such steps will  further  expand for the global good.  18285  PERSONAL EXPLANATION  HON.

272,,105,0.254,223,13,Mr. GILLMOR.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise today to  pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Ohio.  On August 21, 1997, John E. Moon was  in stalled as the national Commander in Chief of  the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United  States.  A resident of Grover Hill, OH, John Moon  entered  the U.S. Marine Corps  in 1967. He  served with  the 2d Battalion, 3d Marine Divi sion in South Vietnam. His military honors in clude  the Vietnam Service Medal with  three  bronze stars, Vietnam Campaign Medal, Viet namese Cross of Gallantry, Vietnam Civil Ac tion Campaign Medal, Combat Action Ribbon,  and the National Defense Service Medal.  John Moon joined the Sherwood, Ohio Post  of Veterans of Foreign Wars  in  1970. He  joined  the Grover Hill VFW  in 1975. He has  served in numerous positions in the VFW, in cluding  terms as  post  commander,  district  commander, and State commander.  John Moon  is only the second Ohioan se lected to serve as the national Commander in  Chief of the VFW. His selection is most cer tainly humbling to him since the membership  roster of the VFW reads as an honor roll of  those who answered their country's most dire  call and successfully defended freedom.  Mr. Speaker, John Moon is a former marine  whose life of service is an inspiration to every  American who believes our Nation's future  is  built on the sacrifices of today.  I ask my col leagues to join me in paying special tribute to  John Moon and to wish him well as he con tinues his dedicated service to country as na tional Commander in Chief of the Veterans of  Foreign Wars of the United States.

273,House,105,-0.386,236,13,Mrs. MALONEY of New York.," Mr.  Speaker, we need to vote on and pass  campaign finance reform. The Speaker  has  said  that  there  is not  enough  money  in  the  system. Yet everyone  else  knows  that  there  is  too much  money in the system.  In  the  1996  elections,  soft money  rolled into campaigns at a record level.  We need to ban soft money. The Amer ican people want elections, not auc tions to the highest bidder or the per son who can spend the most money to  buy and win an election.  The opposition party has budgeted  $12  to $15 million  to  investigate  the  1996  campaigns,  yet  they  have  not  scheduled one hearing on how  to re form the election process. We need to  legislate, not just investigate.  Mr. Speaker, you promised the Presi dent in the famous handshake in New  Hampshire that you would vote on and  work and pass campaign  finance  re form. Mr. Speaker, it is time to turn  the promise of your handshake into the  reality of a law.

274,House,105,0.162,236,13,Mrs. ROUKEMA.," Mr. Speaker, I want  to bring  to my colleagues' attention  here a letter that is probably in their  offices today from me requesting them  to join me and cosign a  letter to the  Speaker on the subject of the tobacco  tax giveaway  that was buried in  the  tax bill  that we passed  last August.  This is really not an issue that is going  to go away. Nor should it. We owe it to  our constituents to correct this oner ous tax windfall  to big tobacco. I am  suggesting that we take the lead of the  other body, which is debating this very  issue  today. But under our rules, we  need the Speaker to schedule this vote.  Mr. Speaker, if we neglect this issue  we will again be feeding the cynicism  of the American people. This will de tract from and undermine our own suc cess in the budget and the tax bill that  we passed. Now we find out that there  was a provision, a big giveaway, mul tiple billions of dollars, maybe $50 bil lion over time to the tobacco industry.  I am urging  to my colleagues  that  whatever merits  there are on either  side, and I obviously take one side of  the issue, I do not like it. It is wrong.  But whatever merits  there  are,  the  Speaker has an obligation to call up for  a vote repeal of this onerous windfall  to big tobacco, schedule the bill, and  begin  to  restore  the professionalism,  integrity, and honor of the House of  Represen ta ti ves.

",1997
275,House,105,-0.491,288,13,Ms. PELOSI.," Mr. Chairman, I move  to  strike  the  requisite  number  of  words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the Hayworth amendment and urge our  colleagues to vote against it.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to, with  all the respect in the world for the pre vious  speaker,  the  gentleman  from  Mississippi [Mr. TAYLOR],  I would like  to address some of the statements that  the gentleman made as well.  Certainly the gentleman laid out a  magnificent  justification  for  funding  for Impact Aid, and I agree with the  gentleman completely. As one who had  three bases in her district up until the  Base Closure Commission  closed  all  three of them, I certainly identify with  the concerns and the values that the  gentleman put forth and the need for  us to have this Impact Aid.  That is why I congratulate our chair man, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr.  PORTER], and our ranking member, the  gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. OBEY],  for increasing the funding in this bill  to $796 million, an increase of $66 mil lion from last year, for Impact Aid. In deed, Impact Aid is a high priority for  our subcommittee, as  is  reflected  in  this amount of money, in the $66 mil lion increase, that was given.  The  gentleman  referenced  that he  does not like  the  idea of questioning  the motives of other Members of Con gress, and neither do I. But I will, when  I  think that the Republican majority  is, once again, for about the fifth day  in a row, hiding behind the children of  America, to make an assault, to con tinue  its assault,  on  the American  worker, and that is what this amend ment  is  about. That  is what  this  amendment is about.  If we want to have bigger increases in  our education programs, and  I  fully  support that, then we have to take a  look at our entire budget and how we  allocate  the 602(b) allocation so  that  the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. POR TER] does not once again in this lamb eat-lamb  subcommittee bill,  because  everything  in here we  can make  a  strong case for and a strong justifica tion for, that is where I would like to  see our Republican colleagues weigh in  for more funding for education, instead  of tax breaks for the wealthiest in our  country and increased funding on the  defense side without question.  I agree with our colleague, the gen tleman  from  Hawaii  [Mr.  ABER CROMBIE], that this, indeed, should be a  line item in the defense budget, and I  commend a member of the Impact Aid  Task Force, the gentleman from North  Carolina  [Mr. HEFNER],  the  ranking  member on the Subcommittee on Mili tary Construction,  for  the  leadership  he has demonstrated  in  funding and  building schools out of that budget for  children of the military.  The gentleman from Texas, our col league [Mr. EDWARDS],  is a cochair of  the  Impact Aid Task Force,  and a  champion in that regard, and he spoke  eloquently  in  opposition  to  the  Hayworth amendment.  But I do question the motives of the  Republican majority to day in and day  out hide behind children. The first day  it was children with disabilities,  the  next day it was vocational education,  it was  the education of our Nation's  children,  and  then alternating back  and forth, children with special needs,  voc-ed,  et cetera,  in order  to  take  money that is there to promote tran quility in the workplace.  The National Labor Relations Board  has a freeze in this budget which rep resents a 5-percent cut in staffing be cause the freeze does not enable them  to keep up with inflation.  This amendment, in addition to that,  guts enforcement of the Nation's labor  laws that protect workers. The amend ment not  only guts protections  for  workers against unfair  firings,  it re duces protection for companies. This is  about workers and about companies.  Both benefit from the work of the Na tional Labor Relations Board.  The Hayworth amendment would re duce protection for companies against  unfair  picketing  and  violence  in  strikes. The amendment would reduce  staffing levels by 14 percent over and  above the reductions that our freeze al ready  impacts,  investigations would  double  or  triple,  and  election  cases  would be delayed up to 3 months.  The bill of the gentleman from Illi nois [Mr. PORTER] is a bipartisan prod uct. It balances  the needs,  the com peting needs, of the very worthy com peting needs that our subcommittee's  jurisdiction  of  Labor,  Health  and  Human Services, and Education pre sents.  I believe that in our national budget  should be a statement of our national  values. It is an honor to serve on this  subcommittee, because we address the  heart of the matter, jobs, job training,  health and the well-being of the Amer ican people,  and  the  education,  the  education of our children.

276,House,105,-0.488,301,13,Mr. TIERNEY.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  the gentleman from Massachusetts for  setting up this opportunity to speak on  this issue tonight. We are hoping that  those who are watching are going to be  able to hear a message that we are un able to bring to the floor, because, to  be partisan for a minute frankly,  the  Republican Party  that does  set  the  agenda in this House has decided not to  have this issue come to the floor.  I  listen  to everybody  talk all day  long about bipartisanship. Frankly,  I  say  to  the gentleman from Maine,  I  think he knows my  feelings on  the  matter, I am not a big supporter of bi partisanship, I am an advocate of par tisanship, but with a  lot of civility,  where we clearly establish what our po sitions are so  the public  is aware of  what  the choices are; and  in a  civil  manner we have discourse, we delib erate, we debate, and we vote. And ev erybody  has,  hopefully,  respect  for  each other, and  that  is how we  live  with the result of that vote and go on.  Unfortunately, I think there has been  another path taken by this particular  majority, some of whom in the Repub lican party are clearly with us on the  issue of campaign finance reform; they  want to debate it and they want to dis cuss it and vote on it. But the majority  over there would not have the ability  to bring forward the prospect of having  this issue debated and voted upon, and  they  cannot get  those  numbers  to gether.  I clearly relate to the gentleman that  the Democratic  caucus  has  decided  that,  as  a  group, Democrats are  in  favor of campaign finance reform. We  are very desirous of having the matter  debated,  having  the  deliberation  in  front of the public, talking about what  might be right or wrong with a par ticular bill, and then moving forward  on that.  I am  told over and over again that  the public opinion polls do not support  it, a public desire for campaign finance  reform. I  think the gentleman knows  as well as I do that, frankly, what it is.  If you ask the question, what issues are  most on your mind, people may well  say, education;  they may say health  care, other issues which may not get  the attention that  they deserve, but  get  some attention at  least  in  this  House.  But  if you ask  the question, what  really undermines  the  credibility of  any action taken by Congress, whether  it be on health care, whether it be on  taxes, whether it be on education, peo ple will say, we do not believe that de cisions  are made  independently. We  think large amounts of money go into  the people that run our Government,  and somehow they have an effect; and  it has a sort of corruptive influence, .or  at least perception, on the work we do  down here.  The gentleman and I both know peo ple are down here working very hard  and that the system is such that you  cannot win a seat here unless you can  get your message out, get your visi bility up, get people to know who you  are and what you stand for.  So I have a challenge for the public.  Basically, we all rely on them, so we  need not to try to get anybody upset,  but I have a challenge for the public. If  they want to get rid of the corrupting  influence,  or  perception,  of money,  then we have  to decide how we are  going  to do  that; and  I  favor  com prehensive campaign finance reform.  Frankly, as much as  I applaud the  gentleman's efforts, and I  think they  have been wonderful and  I  think we  may end up standing behind the gentle man's effort, because I have  told the  gentleman over and over again,  those  who believe we have to move forward  on this issue will not stand behind a  bill we file or cosponsor as a defense to  not  voting  for  anything  or  having  nothing at all passed. We will be open minded and we will try to move for ward in the area of reform.  ",1997

279,,105,-0.404,392,13,Mr. MATSUI.," Mr. Speaker, we rise today to  pay  tribute  to an exceptional public servant  and leader in the Sacramento community, Mr.  Samuel L. Jackson.  A native of Florida, Sam Jackson was born  in Pensacola  in 1947. Early on, Mr. Jackson  set himself apart as an honor roll student com mitted to obtaining a worthy education. To fur ther this goal, Mr. Jackson enlisted in the U.S.  Air Force in 1966. His military service, includ ing a 13-month tour of duty  in Vietnam, al lowed him  to serve his  country and  earn  money for college.  After his discharge  from  the Air Force  in  1970, Mr. Jackson  followed  through on his  educational goals,  first at Sacramento City  College, and  then at California State Univer sity, Sacramento. Following  his  graduation  with honors from CSUS, Mr. Jackson enrolled  at  the University of  the Pacific, McGeorge  School of Law in 1974. There, he served as  president of the Black Law Students Associa tion in 1976. At his graduation from McGeorge  in 1977, Mr. Jackson was presented the Fac ulty Outstanding Student Achievement Award,  becoming the first student of color to ever re ceive that high honor.  As a young attorney, Sam Jackson worked  as a criminal prosecutor  in  the Sacramento  County District Attorney's Office  from  1977  until 1979. Then, he accepted a position with  the city of Sacramento as a deputy city attor ney. By 1988, Mr. Jackson had  risen  to  the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  position of senior deputy city attorney in  the  minimum  time allowed. In 1989, he became  the first African-American elected president of  the Sacramento County Bar Association.  . Mr. Jackson also maintained his long-stand ing commitment to education by serving as a  professor of  legal studies at American River  College from 1979 to 1994.  In 1994, Sam Jackson's tireless efforts on  behalf of the people of Sacramento, marked  by an esteemed  reputation  for  integrity and  community activism, earned him  the post of  city attorney by a unanimous vote of the city  council. In this position, Sam Jackson has ex celled as a tough litigator for the city of Sac ramento. But he has never foregone the com munity service endeavors which are so near to  his heart, especially his work with children.  As a strong advocate  for the Big Brothers  and Big Sisters organization, Little  League  baseball, Sacramento's St. Hope Academy,  and  the Citizenship and Law-Related Edu cation Center, Sam Jackson has established a  legacy of service on behalf of Sacramento's  youth.  He has also thrived in a number of influen tial professional  legal organizations  in Cali fornia.  In 1995, he became  the  first African American elected to the California State Bar's  board of governors. He also became the first  person of color elected president of the Alumni  Association  for his alma mater, McGeorge  Law School.  Mr. Speaker, we ask our colleagues to join  us in saluting Samuel L. Jackson for a remark able  record of professional excellence and  community service. The people of Sacramento  are the proud beneficiaries of Sam Jackson's  hard work and good citizenship.  MEDICARE  HON. LEE H. HAMILTON  OF INDIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 10, 1997  Mr. HAMIL TON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to  insert my Washington Report for Wednesday,  August  13, 1997,  into  the CONGRESSIONAL  RECORD:  REFORMING MEDICARE 1  Medicare has been a very successful gov ernment program in providing for the health  of older persons and the disabled. It has sub stantially  improved access  to health care.  Because of Medicare, the percentage of older  Americans with health  coverage  has  in creased from less  than 50%  in the 1960s  to  99% today. And since it was initiated three  decades ago, life expectancy at age 65 has in creased by more than it did in the six dec ades before Medicare. All of  this has made  Medicare one of our most popular social pro grams.  But Medicare has some major cost-related  problems. First, its sharply increasing costs  have been a major contributor to the large  budget deficits of recent years. In just three  decades its costs have grown to about 2%% of  the nation's gross domestic product (GDP).  And if no action is taken it will claim nearly  4% GDP  ten years from now and 8% of GDP  by the middle of the next century. It is sim ply not possible  to balance the budget and  keep it balanced unless large Medicare savSeptember 10, 1997  ings are achieved. Second, the numbers driv ing the future projections are simply relent less. Today we have 24 million retirees, but  when the baby boom generation is fully re tired the figure will be 48 million. Yet the  number of working-age citizens whose pay roll taxes finance most of the Medicare bene fits will increase only 20% in that period and  Medicare spending per beneficiary continues  to rise. Third, excess care is often provided,  as beneficiaries simply do not have to decide  if medical services are worth their cost. And  providers do not have sufficient incentive to  reduce the cost of medical services because  their payments are based on the number and  type of services  they provide. Finally,  the  amount of fraud and waste in the Medicare  program,  is huge. The government spends  about $200 billion a year on Medicare, yet re cent estimates are that lh of that consists of  overpayment. We now have only about one  agent  to  investigate  every  $10  billion  of  Medicare spending.  Program Changes: Given  the  rapid pro jected growth in Medicare, it is not politi cally realistic to expect tax increases to re store solvency to the program, especially in  the current anti-tax mood  in  the country.  Thus Congress  is focusing on cutting back  costs and restructuring  the Medicare pro gram. There are three main approaches: cut ting back payments  to providers  (doctors  and  hospitals),  requiring Medicare  bene ficiaries to pay more, and restricting Medi care to provide for market-based incentives.  These approaches are not mutually exclu sive, and reform is proceeding along all three  lines.  Cutting back payments to providers: Medi care's prospective payment system for hos pitals has helped  curb payments  to pro viders. This system creates roughly 470 diag nosis-related groups (DRGs) into which hos pitals admissions have to be placed. It  is a  complex system, but it has created incen tives for hospitals to be more efficient. Yet  the prospective payment system is no pan acea. The payments apply only  to certain  Medicare-covered  services,  and when pay ments to providers are cut back they often  respond by performing more services to off set some of their income loss. The recently  passed  budget  reconciliation  agreement  achieved most of its savings by curbing and  reforming payments to providers, but it is  generally agreed now that cutting back fees  is not a long-range solution to the Medicare  problem.  Making patients pay more: Another ap proach is to make the beneficiariesthe pa tientspay more. More of the burden could  be  shifted  to  beneficiaries  by  increasing  their costs or increasing the age of Medicare  eligibility. In general, most of  the experts  think that it makes some sense to impose at  least part of the burden on Medicare bene ficiaries since they are the ones who receive  the benefits. This year Congress considered  proposals to strengthen Medicare's financial  condition by charging extra premiums  to  wealthier retirees, raising the eligibility age,  and imposing a co-payment of $5 per visit for  home health care services. None of those pro posalssurvived in the final bill, but there is  broad agreement that it would be a mistake  to consider them dead.  Restructuring  program:  The  third  ap proach is to redesign the Medicare system in  a way that can improve its efficiency. Today  Medicare guarantees people a particular in surance  plan.  An  alternative,  ""choice based"",  system would guarantee people  a  fixed amount of money with which to pur chase health  insurance, but it would not  ",1997

Mr. Speaker,  the people are  telling  this Congress that they are sick and  tired of big money flooding  into  the  halls of Government, and they are fed  up with special  interests  taking pri ority over the national interests. Mr.  Speaker, most of all,  they are fed up  that the Republican leadership still re fuses to act.  Mr. Speaker, let us hold hearings, re view the good bills that have already  been drafted, and pass meaningful cam paign finance reform legislation.

""If it  SCHOOL CHOICE AND  EDUCATION  SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WILL GIVE  STUDENTS HOPE  (Mr.  ADERHOLT  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute and to revise and extend  his remarks.)  ",1997
281,House,105,0.36,405,13,Mr. ADERHOLT.," Mr. Speaker,  for  many of our country's  poorest chil dren, education is their one ticket out  of poverty.  In  fact, even children  in  truly horrible schools manage to make  it out of their destitution by relentless  determination and plain old hard work.  But, Mr.  Speaker,  children  should  not have to pass through metal detec tors on their way through the school house door. If kids are more worried  about becoming victims of violence  than about getting an ""A"" on the next  exam, how can we expect them to per form their best?  Mr. Speaker, in the face of school vi olence and disorderly classrooms,  to  whom can  the kids  turn? Why,  their  parents, of course. But what if their  parents lack the resources to pull them  out of horrible schools?  Mr. Speaker, while the special inter ests join together in saying too bad or  offer up worthless promises, conserv atives offer these kids hope in the form  of school choice and education savings  accounts.  Mr. Speaker, hope is a commodity in  short supply in many of our Nation's  poorest  communities.  School  choice  and education  savings accounts give  kids and  their parents a  reason  to  hope.  DEMOCRATS PUSH NATIONAL  EDUCATION AGENDA  (Mr. WYNN asked and was given per mission  to  address  the House  for 1  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)  ",1997
282,House,105,-0.38,405,13,Mr. WYNN.,"  Mr.  Speaker,  today  Democrats want to improve education  in America. We want to do it because  education is the key to our democracy.  We want to do  it, more  importantly,  because education  is  the key  to our  children's future.  In the first instance, Democrats be lieve we need national standards. The  fact is that algebra is the same wheth er a student is from Maine, Missouri or  whether  they are  from my State of  Maryland. We need to be able to meas ure whether our students can master  algebra and other subjects so they can  compete against their foreign counter parts. We need national standards.  Second, we need school construction  funds. We hear the Republicans  jump  up and  say, oh,  schools are a  local  issue. Yes, Mr. Speaker,  they are a  local issue. But the fact again is that  local communities need help. We have  crumbling schools. Almost a  third of  our schools need repairs. They need to  fix broken windows and leaking roofs.  We have overcrowded schools all over  America.  Mr. Speaker, we here  in Congress  have a duty and responsibility to help  local communities. Families play the  most critical role, but families cannot  build schools alone. Families cannot  repair roofs alone. We need a national  education agenda that the Democrats  are pushing.

286,,105,-0.513,444,13,Mrs. MINK of Hawaii.," Mr. Chairman,  I  thank  the gentleman  for yielding  time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I believe there might  be some merit to look at the jurisdic tion,  exercise of  jurisdiction by  the  NLRB. But  certainly,  to bring  this  matter before  the floor,  to ask for a  vote, is simply not the way to go. The  matter should be brought to the com mittee.  The Member  of  the majority  cer tainly has access to the leadership on  the majority side of the Committee on  Education and the Workforce, and will  be able to work out a matter such as  this and allow the committees to delib erate on it, call hearings, have an anal ysis, to bring this matter to the floor  without our ability to understand even  what  the  impacts of  this  limitation  would be?  And the most egregious part of this  amendment is, as we know, an appro priation bill has only  the effect of 1  year. That means that this limitation  would be in effect only for 1 year, the  life of the appropriation bill. So  the  people who are affected by it are not  going  to  know whether, when  the  charges are brought,  they fall within  the old jurisdiction or the new jurisdic tion.  Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that  the  employers will  have  a  greater  havoc in terms of the stability of their  own operations,  to  know whether a  matter can  legitimately come under  the Board or cannot come under the  Board. It will be a huge mess to try to  untangle  this whole  issue of jurisdic tion, which is a very, very troublesome  matter.  Second, it would seem to me that the  employers out there  listening  to  this  debate ought to be enraged at the idea  that  this  instability  in  jurisdiction  would be foisted by the adoption of this  amendment. What is going to happen  is, when jurisdictional issues are raised  as to whether the Board can look into  an employer's complaint, there is going  to have  to be an overhaul, again, of  much of the confidential material that  will be necessary for the Board to have  in order to make  these  jurisdictional  decisions, because they go to the oper ations  of  the  business: How much  money, what  the  gross  intake was,  what the expenditures were, in order to  make a determination as  to whether  the new jurisdictions would allow the  Board to have jurisdiction or not have  jurisdiction.  I think it would be an extremely cha otic situation to have an appropriation  bill decide this very difficult matter of  jurisdiction of the Board. These mat ters ought to be left to the authorizing  committee, my Committee  on Edu cation and  the Workforce, and I am  sure  that  this distinguished Member  who has offered this amendment would  have  the access and ability  to work  with  the Republican members of my  committee and determine whether a  bill  can be  fashioned which  can be  brought  to  the consideration of our  committee.  The idea of having this matter then  go to the States for determination is a  second  point  of  uncertainty. There  would be no uniform operations of the  application of this law in order to determine what is proper activity on the  part of the working person, upon  the  unions, as also against the correct op erations of the employer.  Because  if a  business  is exempted  under this exemption provision which  has been offered and is no longer under  the  jurisdiction of  the Board, what  happens is, it has to then fall under the  jurisdiction of the State or local com munities, and we will then have no uni form  labor policy with  reference  to  labor activity and worker protections.  It seems  to me  that whatever  the  merits are of looking at the  jurisdic tional issues, it ought to be left to the  committees.  I urge my colleagues  to  vote down this amendment.  ",1997

288,,105,0.492,444,13,Mr. ISTOOK.," Mr. Chairman, I rise in  support of the amendment of the gen tleman  from  Indiana  [Mr.  HOSTETTLER].  I  think it is interesting  to hear some people being concerned  suddenly with  redtape or procedure,  rather than the merits of this, because  I  thought we were here about a par ticular government agency, and it is  certainly not alone in this, but a par ticular government agency that had its  dollar  threshold  of  jurisdiction,  in  other words, the level at which it could  start getting involved in a business, set  in 1959, and it has not been adjusted for  inflation since then.  We are told that there are no things  certain in this world except for  two,  that the only  two certain  things are  death and taxes. Well, they are wrong,  Mr. Chairman. There is a  third thing.  The third thing that is perpetual and  eternal is a government prog-ram. Once  it is in place, it perpetuates its exist ence.  The National Labor Relations Board,  when it had the jurisdictional thresh old set in 1959,  there was a reason for  it, so you could know what kinds of  disputes were a Federal case that need ed  to  involve  a  Federal  agency  in  Washington, DC, and what other mat ters still covered by Federal iaw really  should be handled on the  local  level,  and they could be handled in the State  courts, where it is more convenient for  everybody  concerned, without hiring  the  specialists, without  having  the  huge expense of going back and forth  to Washington or going to a  regional  office of the NLRB. So the jurisdiction,  when the NLRB could get involved, was  set at a particular level.  For example,  for a  nonretail busi ness, if they had $50,000 a year of gross  volume, then in 1959 dollars, they said,  that is a big enough business that the  NLRB ought  to be  involved  in  that.  Today that equivalent amount would  require that you have a business doing  business with something closer to, I be lieve, around $300,000.  Mr. Chairman, it makes no sense not  to adjust for inflation. We hear people  ",1997
289,Senate,105,0.311,574,13,Mr. ABRAHAM.," Mr. President, I rise  today  to  introduce  the China Policy  Act of 1997. Cosponsors of this legisla tion  include  Senators  FEINGOLD,  HUTCHINSON,  COVERDELL,  DE WINE,  ASHCROFT,  BROWNBACK,  MACK,  and  HELMS.  Now  is  the  time, Mr. President,  to  take a closer look at our relations with  the People's Republic of China. Prep arations are underway for the October  28  state  visit  of Chinese President  Jiang Zemin. The President will be  feted, toasted, and praised. Meanwhile,  Wei Jingsheng rots in a Beijing prison,  serving out a 14-year sentence for the  crime of peacefully advocating democ racy and other political reforms.  This contrast, in my view, points up  the current crisis  in United StatesChina relations. For too long now, this  administration has put process over  substance, holding  repeated meetings  and discussions with Chinese  leaders,  but failing  to set and hold to a con crete agenda addressing critical issues  of human rights and religious freedom,  as well as nuclear and other weapons  proliferation.  There is much of substance to work  out with Chinese  leaders, Mr. Presi dent. To begin with, China's record of  human rights abuses and repression of  religious faith is long and disturbing.  Women pregnant with their second or  third  child  have  been  coerced  into  abortions. Peaceful  advocates of de mocracy  and political  reforms have  been sentenced to long terms in prisons  where they have been beaten, tortured,  and denied needed medical care. Reli gious meeting places have been  forc ibly closed. Tibetan monks refusing to  condemn  their  religious  leader,  the  Dalai Lama, have been  forced  from  their monasteries; some of their lead ers have disappeared.  President Clinton  knows  full well  about these abuses. His own State De partment  just  released  a  report  on  human  rights  in China which states  that in 1996 ""The Government contin ued  to commit widespread and well documented human rights abuses,  in  violation of  internationally accepted  norms, stemming from the authorities'  intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest,  and the absence or inadequacy of laws  protecting basic  freedoms."" America  cannot allow  these abuses of  funda mental human rights to continue unop posed.  Our own national security also de mands that we take a firmer, more sub stantive stance  in our dealings with  China. Although China signed the Nu clear Non-Proliferation  Treaty  and  agreed  to abide by  the  terms of  the  missile  technology control  regime  in  1992,  violations  of both  agreements  continue.  Especially worrisome  are  Chinese sales of weapons technology to  Pakistan, Iran, and other countries in  the Middle East.  Chinese weapons exports also have  more  directly  threatened Americans  here on United States soil. Companies  associated with the People's Liberation  Army  [PLA]  have  been  caught  at tempting  to  sell  smuggled  assault  weapons to street gangs in Los Ange les.  Mr. President, I am not advocating  any  rash  response  to  these  provo cations. China is an important nation  with the potential to take part in mu tually beneficial commerce and diplo matic  cooperation,  or  destabilize  a  number of important strategic areas.  In my view our disagreements with  China call  for development of  incen tives  and  disincentives  designed  to  steer that country toward internal lib eralization and constructive participa tion in the international community.  Up until now, debates over American  policy  toward China have focused al most exclusively on the annual exten sion of that country's most-favored-na tion trading status [MFN]. Both sides  in this debate have highlighted legiti mate issues calling for reasoned argu ment. But, now that Congress has re newed MFN, it is imperative that we  address broader United States-China  relations,  lest China  policy  be  rel egated to  the back pages for another  year.  I firmly believe, Mr. President, that  Congress and  the President can put  United States-Chinese  relations on a  course toward substantive progress by  taking concrete action now. That  is  why I am introducing the China Policy  Act of 1997. This legislation is designed  to discourage the Chinese regime from  oppressive internal policies and desta bilizing  actions  contrary  to United  States national security, while advanc ing American values of freedom and  human rights among the Chinese peo ple.  It represents  a  consensus  view  reached  among  proponents  on  both  sides of the MFN question. It combines  provisions of China-related bills and  amendments authored by myself and  Senators  FEINGOLD,  ASHCROFT,  DEWINE, COVERDELL, and BROWNBACK. I  would like to extend special thanks to .  Senator  FEINGOLD  for  strengthening  the human rights focus of the bill.  This legislation includes a number of  sanctions aimed at Chinese leaders in tended to express our dismay at recent  human  rights abuses. First,  the bill  would deny American visas  to high  ranking Chinese Government officials  involved in political and religious per secution. The bill also would require  United States representatives at multi lateral  develqpment  banks  to  vote  ""no""  on all  loans  to China,  except  those related to famine, national dis aster relief, and environmental protec tion. This last provision also puts into  practice the important principle that  United States taxpayers should not be  forced to subsidize the Chinese Govern ment.  In addition, Mr. President,  the bill  would  institute  targeted  sanctions  against PLA companies found to have  engaged in weapons proliferation, ille gal  importation  of weapons  to  the  United States or military or political  espionage  in  the United States. The  U.S. Government also would publish a  list of other PLA-controlled  compa nies. This would allow American com panies and consumers to decide wheth er they wish to purchase products man ufactured in whole or in part by the  Communist Chinese army. The bill also  takes direct aim at China's use of slave  labor by  instituting stricter enforce ment of the ban against sale of Chinese  products  produced  in  prison  labor  camps.  These  sanctions,  specifically aimed  at government officials and  the Chi nese  Governmental  apparatus,  will  ",1997
290,,105,-0.402,626,13,Mr. PALLONE.," Mr. Speaker, I would like to  draw my colleagues' attention to a very impor tant event that is taking place on September  16, 17, and 18 in Atlantic City, NJ.  On that day, about 80 members of the 50th  Battalionveterans of  the Korean war-will  reunite to commemorate the tremendous con tribution of  the 50th Battalion  from 1950  to  1955 and honor the soldiers who were injured  and who died in many critical offensives of the  Korean war.  I am pleased to call as a friend the coordi nator of the event, Peter A. Marone, and wish  him great success for this reunion of Korean  war heroes. These wishes also go out to the  cocoordinator, Donald Sullivan of Absecon,  NJ.  Mr. Marone, former mayor of St. Pleasant,  NJ, has reminded me of the tremendous con tribution made by  the 50th Battalion and  I  want to share a brief account with you.  The goal of the initial invasion by our troops  at  Inchon  in September, 1950, was  to seize  the vital  rail and communications center of  Seoul, seal off the main areas of escape  to  the north, and secure the port at  Inchon and  the airfields at Kimpo and Seoul.  This  incredible series of battles and  troop  movements was followed shortly by what was  called ""The Christmas Miracle."" By November  1950 the Korean war seemed all but over. The  North Koreans were squeezed back  to  the  Yalu River  on  the Manchurian  border.  It  seemed the war was coming to an end.  But on November 27, Communist China  sent 120,000 troops into North Korea and pit ted  them against 15,000 U.N. forces  in  the  East. There were many casualties among Ma rines and Army troops.  In the following days,  of  the 15,000 U.N.  troops encircled by  the  Communist Chinese, 12,000 became casual ties.  It was  then that the chosen fighters of the  50th Battalion made their greatest contribution.  By checking the Chinese forces in the moun tains as part of a perimeter established around  September 11, 1997  the besieged Hamhung, they enabled the es cape of 100,000 North Korean men, women,  and children to safety.  I would like to recognize the courage of the  participants  in the Christmas Miracle, as well  as all those who nobly served in the battalion  in  the following years. It  is so  important that  current and future generations never forget the  sacrifices and  the bravery of the soldiers of  the 50th Battalion as well as all  the veterans  of our wars.

291,Senate,105,0.331,743,13,Mr. BENNETT.," Mr. President, with  all of  the discussions  that have oc curred  in recent weeks regarding the  Bureau  of  Indian Affairs  [BIA],  it  seems that every year about this time,  we in Congress scratch our heads and  wring our hands over how to improve  efficiency with this most cumbersome  of Federal bureaucracies.  I want  to  share with my colleagues an experience  that one of my constituents recently  had with the BIA. It deals with Hodges,  Inc., a  small construction  firm with  home offices in Sandy, UT. This is a  case with a  long and complicated his tory, but I want my colleagues to have  a better understanding of what it is  like for a small contractor to conduct  business with the BIA.  On June 20, 1994, the BIA awarded to  Hodges, Inc., a contract for the renova tion of the Taos Pueblo Day School in  New Mexico, in the amount of $649,541.  According to this agreement, the ren ovation work was  to have been com pleted within 120 days from July 5, 1994.  The first problem occurred when the  architect of the project was also se lected  to be  the contracting officer's  representative  [COR] creating several  built-in  conflicts  of  interest. When  Hodges,  Inc.,  the primary contractor,  pointed out several deficiencies in the  design,  the COR unfortunately  inter preted these comments as personal at tacks. Problems escalated as the COR  visited the job site only three or four  times, and failed to take into account  differing site conditions, changes, and  payment clauses of the contract. The  COR never attempted to determine if  the work was satisfactorily completed  at the time of invoice preparation.  Unfortunately, the COR and the con tracting officer also  failed  to under stand the significance and importance  of issuing change orders  to  the con tractor. Numerous  incidents occurred  during the renovation when change or ders were issued to the contractor, di recting him to perform a specific repair  and to submit a proposal for that work.  Under the  terms of the original con tract, Hodges, Inc., had no choice but  to perform these tasks as directed and,  in return,  the contracting officer was  to pay the contractor an equitable ad justment, covering any increased costs  and recognize the additional contract  performance time as a result of the di rected change.

292,Senate,105,0.419,782,13,Mr. HUTCHINSON.," That, of course, is  the whole concept behind our amend ment-local control. Send  the money  back to the States, the Governors, the  State legislatures, and the State arts  council would have  the discretion  to  increase funding.  In the case of Alabama, and I do not  have the exact numbers in front of me,  but the amount of resources available  to  the State of Alabama would be  greatly  enhanced  under  the  block  grants approach  in which we  send a  $500,000 grant to every State, and then  simply distribute  it on a  per capita  basis. That would allow  the State of  Alabama  to give much more  to  the  Shakespearean theater.  I was  interested to hear your com ments yesterday quoting Anthony Hop kins  and  his  appreciation  for  that  Shakespeare  theater  there  in Mont gomery.  So  the needed  resources would be  much more available, and that would  be controlled locally. So insomuch as  there was local support in Alabama for  increased funding,  I  think the oppor tunity would be much enhanced.  Frankly,  I am puzzled why anyone  would oppose  the approach  that you  and I are offering. I can understand the  5 States that would lose funding being  opposed to this, but the 45 States and  the Senators from  the 45 States that  would see their funding for the arts in creased  under  our  approach while  eliminating  bureaucracy  in Wash ington, it is really difficult for me to  see how someone objects to that.

293,House,105,0.552,860,13,Mr. GUTKNECHT.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to congratulate my Governor,  Arne Carlson, of Minnesota. Back  in  Minnesota we are very proud of our  schools and we are very proud of our  students. Many people listen to Garri son Keiler when he  talks about Lake  Wobegone,  and  sometimes we  talk  about the Lake Wobegone syndrome.  In fact, we do believe our women are  strong, our men are good looking, and  our children are above average. And  there is reason to believe that. If we  look at the numbers, Minnesota stu dents rank second in graduation rate.  On the ACT test, we once again ranked  in second place  in all of  the United  States  in 1996. But  that  is  the good  news.  The bad news is, in some of the tests  that we have been giving our students  in the last several years on basic skills,  Minnesota students are not doing as  well as they should. In reading, for ex ample, we asked students to read a few  newspaper articles,  then answer some  questions, and only 59 percent of the  students passed that test.  That  is why Governor Carlson,  to gether with  the  legislature, began a  process this year of real reform of our  schools,  and  that was built  around  choices and giving parents more em powerment. It is tax credits. It is em powering parents with more deduct ibility for educational expenses.  We  in Washington ought  to do  the  same. In fact,  they say back in Min nesota, either lead, follow, or get out of  the way. In terms of education reform,  we ought to follow the lead of Governor  Carlson and other brave Governors who  are empowering parents to get better  education for their kids.  1  NATIONAL STUDENT TESTING IS  NOT THE ANSWER  (Mr. COOK asked and was given per mission  to  address  the House  for  minute and to revise and extend his re marks.)

294,House,105,0.471,860,13,Mr. WELDON of Florida.," Mr. Speak er, my question  is, Would a plan  to  make it easier for parents to save for  their children's college education be a  good  thing or a bad  thing? What  if  their children  took  that money and  used it to go  to a private university  like Harvard? Would that be a  threat  to public universities like the Univer sity of Michigan or the University of  Virginia? Or would that make schools  like the University of Michigan and the  University of Virginia try even harder  to compete  for  students  that might  otherwise go to Harvard?  If allowing parents to send their kids  to Harvard is not a  threat  to public  universities, why would making it a  little easier for parents to send their  kids to private schools be a  threat to  public schools at the elementary and  secondary level? Could it be that many  parents would vote with their feet and  take  their  kids  out  of  bad  public  schools  and  put  them  in  private  schools? That would force bad schools  to clean up  their act or shut down,  which is exactly the point.

Mr. Speaker, the distinguished chair man of the full Committee on Science  has, I think, given an excellent state ment explaining the nature of the bill.  I, of course, strongly support the reau thorization of the act. I was involved in  1977 in the passage of the original pro gram and I have watched it flourish  from  its original passage up  to  the  present time.  I  should comment here  that devel oping a program which involves close  cooperation of four separate agencies is  not easy  to  do  in  the bureaucratic  world of Washington, and it does chal lenge the oversight role of the appro priate committees. I think that on the  Committee on Science,  and particu larly under  the chairmanship of  the  gentleman  from Wisconsin  [Mr. SEN SENBRENNER],  that we have  tried  to  measure up to the requirements of this  challenge.  The program, over the last two dec ades, has accomplished many things. It  has  produced  geological maps  and  model building codes, for example, that  have helped many  communities not  only  understand  their  seismological  risk but to know what to do about it.  In  the Nation's public  schools  the  program has introduced schoolchildren  to the science of earthquakes, and with  our universities it has trained many of  the Nation's leading seismologists and  earthquake engineers but, most impor tantly, for 20 years, NEHRP has pro vided an authoritative voice informing  the public about what are  real and  what are imagined threats from earth quakes, and this is a job that we must  not  trivialize, especially since Holly wood still produces  films  like  ""Vol cano,"" a  film  that I enjoyed by  the  way, no matter how factually incorrect  it was.  Despite this long list of accomplish ments, NEHRP has also failed to meet  many of the expectations of its original  sponsors, and I think I can say that ob jectively, as one of those sponsors. For  example,  it has been unable  to con vince every earthquake prone commu nity to adopt stronger building codes  or to enforce testing protocols for new  construction methods or to completely  monitor earthquake prone areas with  state-of-the-art equipment.  0 1330  While  these  shortcomings  can  be  blamed on such  things as a  lack of  funding,  they are also a result of pri ority-setting efforts within  the  four  different NEHRP agencies that are fo cused primary on each agency's indi vidual initiatives and not on the needs  of the multiagency NEHRP program.  I have already commented on how  difficult that is to do in large scale or ganizations, and this program gives us  an  opportunity  to  experiment with  ways of handling these kinds of com plex interagency programs.  I am excited that the bill before us  today  addresses  some of  these  con cerns.

299,House,105,0.673,886,13,Mr. SALMON.," I thank the gentleman  for yielding to me, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  rule. Sadly, we got a bit off track on  what we are supposed to be discussing.  I would  concur with  the gentleman  from Florida's comments who said that  we  cannot  talk about our men and  women in the armed services and the  wonderful contributions they make to  this country.  Mr. Speaker, as I go home each week end,  I meet with constituents, and  I  talk on talk shows, and I do town hall  meetings. The one thing that clearly is  communicated  to me  time and  time  again is the fact that this body is not  very well  respected.  fact,  some  might even say this body is hated and  despised. I  think it is because hypoc risy flows down the aisles of this body.  I think time and time again there are  those that speak out of both sides of  their mouths.  I am not saying there is a corner on  that market with either party, but I  have to say that the hypocrisy that I  am hearing ring so  loudly  from  the  other side is very, very confusing and  disheartening.  In  0 1445  In fact, what they do rings so loudly  in my ears I cannot hear what  they  say.  In the past  there have been TV  evangelists who stand up, bully thump  on the podium and talk about the rav ages and  the wrongs associated with  immorality and extramarital affairs,  and  then  these same TV evangelists,  they patrol the streets looking for la dies of the evening to satisfy their de sires, and then they wonder aloud why  people have  lost confidence  in  them.  And we see the exact same thing hap pening in this body when we see fla grant violation after violation after  violation.  And then we have folks on the other  side that are trying to play the old bait  and switch trick, trying to take the at tention from the one nut with the pea  under it so that they can pull the old  trick on us. Well,  let us get down to  business and let us make sure that we  honor  the  laws  that we have on  the  books.  I wish that the last speaker was just  as passionate in calling for the Attor ney General to call on a special counsel  so  that we can get  to  the bottom of  whether or not existing laws have been  violated. Again, what they do rings so  loudly in my ears I cannot hear what  they say.  The New York Times editorial says  Democrats skim $2 million to aid can didates, records show. Why is it that  ",1997
300,House,105,0.336,899,13,Mr. GOODLING.," Mr. Chairman,  I  have been rather disappointed on sev eral occasions in the last couple weeks  when it was mentioned by some that  perhaps this was a political argument.  I want  to  assure  everyone  this has  nothing to do with politics whatsoever.  My concern and my interest comes  from 22 years as an educator, 22 years  as a  teacher, a guidance counselor, a  principal, a superintendent of schools,  a  supervisor of  student  teachers,  a  school board president, a PTA presi dent. My concern  is based simply on  the fact that I believe I have learned a  lot in those 22 years as to how children  learn, why children do not learn, and  what one does in order to have children  learn. As a matter of fact,  in March  1991 I wrote an op ed, and that was dur ing President Bush's administration, in  opposition tb this very same issue.  We are told, first of all, that 17-year olds in this country, some of the most  recent statistics would indicate that 52  percent read fairly well, comprehend  fairly well, and do math and science  quite well. That means that the other  50 percent do poorly.  I would ask all of my colleagues who  are here and all who may be listening  to put themselves in the shoes of that  other 50 percent, that 50 percent that  has not done well and who are not  doing well at the present time. This 50  percent has been  tested with  every  standardized test there is, whether it is  Iowa, whether it is California, Stan ford. They have been tested with every  State test. They have been tested with  every district test, and they have been  tested with every classroom test.  What have they been told after every  one of  those  tests? The same  thing:  ""You are not doing very well."" What  they do not want, what that 50 percent  do not want at this time is to spend an other $100 million  to  test  them one  more  time on a  standardized test to  tell  them  ""You are not doing very  well."" They want to know what it is we  are going to do to help them do better.  If someone is in the cattle business,  they do not fatten cattle by constantly  putting them on the scales and weigh ing them. We do not make a car run  any faster by adding another speedom eter. And we do not help those who are  not doing well  in education with one  more standardized national test to tell  them ""You are doing poorly.""  It was an interesting discussion re cently in the other body when I testified before a Senate committee. The  Secretary indicated that it is a tragedy  that students do not have algebra and  do not understand algebra by the time  they get to 8th grade, and then a little  later said, ""and in our test we will test  for algebra.""  And one of the gentlemen from  the  other body said, ""Mr. Secretary, I must  have missed something. I thought you  said they did not have any algebra by  the time they got to the eighth grade.""  ""That is right.""  ""But then I thought I heard you say  you are going to include in your test,  algebra."" Well,  that does not make  very much sense, does it?  First of all, as I have said so many  times, if we want to move in that di rection,  then we  sure better prepare  those elementary  teachers who have  had very little math in college, have  had very  little math in high school,  and all of a sudden we are going to ask  them to teach algebra.  Let us take the other 50 percent. Let  us shift the debate. Suppose we believe  in a national test. We certainly would  not go about it in a manner in which it  was gone about this particular time. If  we believe that there is some value in  a national standardized test, the first  thing we have to do is determine what  is our purpose, and that purpose has to  be very narrowly stated. We  cannot  have a valid test, all test experts will  tell us, if we do not narrowly focus.  Well, what is the purpose of a test? I  heard four, five, six different purposes,  one of which, the Assistant Secretary  said, ""I am not happy with  the cur ricula in this country, and we have to  do something about that."" That is an  interesting  statement.  That  should  scare everybody, I think, because who  is going to develop that curricula that  he was talking about, since he does not  like what is there at the present time?  So we narrowly focus.  Another says, well,  this is to  judge  one school against another school so  that we know which schools are doing  well, which are doing poorly. That is  one of the worst statements I  think  anyone could make, because now I am  going to compare someone who has had  no advantages whatsoever as far as pre school reading readiness is concerned,  in a school where there are many stu dents who  fit  that category, with a  school where they have had all the ad vantages in preschool.  And so somehow or other with ana tional  test,  I am going  to help that  group that have not had those advan tages, and then I can do a better job of  comparing them with those who have  had all the advantages. In my area, I  would say we would not compare inner  city Pittsburgh with upper St. Claire,  which is an area outside of Pittsburgh.  So we say, okay, the purpose is cur ricula. Now we have to determine what  it is we want to test. Now we are get ting into some real serious difficulties,  what we want to test.  Well,  that means, and I am not up  here arguing, and I do not want to get  involved in this business of,  ""Yes, it  will be a national curricula; no, it will  not,"" but we have to determine what it  is we are going to test. In order to do  that, someone, someone or somebody  has to determine what that curricula  is. Otherwise, how would we know what  we are going to test?  Now make sure we understand that  this  is  really  a  controversial  issue.  That is why we never should have by passed the Congress in the first place.  That  is why  the debate should have  been here. That  is why  the debate  should go on next year, when we are re authorizing TIMSS, when we are reau thorizing NAEPs, programs where we  spend millions of dollars every year  from the Federal level in the business  of testing.  But if we think there is a consensus  out  there,  then we are missing some  very important points. There is no con sensus. Let me  just read one portion  from a  letter signed by 500 or more  mathematicians from across this coun try. This is what those mathematicians  said:  The committee which is drafting the exam  specifications is biased. First, nearly all of  its members are  strong advocates of  the  NCTM standards and of programs that re pute to be aligned with the NCTM standards.  There is not a balance of different viewpoints  regarding mathematics education.  Second, members of the committee have  significant conflict of interest, as they are  activity  involved  in  the writing or pro motion of particular mathematics curricula.  Even the slightest suspicion that the authors  would bias the test toward material covered  in their program, or that their authorship of  the tests would be used to sell their program  or to help them get grants, undermines the  credibility of the exam.  So I want my colleagues  to under stand how controversial this is. Now we  have decided that we are going to nar rowly focus it, I hope. Then we have de cided what it is we wanted to test. And  then after we have made that decision,  someone must write that curriculum in  order so  that we are  testing  toward  what it is that was taught.  After we have done all of that,  the  next step then is, of course, to educate  the teacher, to prepare the teacher to  teach to the new standards, to teach to  what it is for which we are testing. And  after we have done all of that, there is  one big step left; and that is, as every  testing expert will tell you, it takes 3  to 4 years to develop a valid test. Not  1 year, like the plan is, 3 to 4 years.  We are going to hear some say, ""Oh,  but this is voluntary."" Nonsense. What  Federal  program  do my  colleagues  know,  once  it was  started,  is  vol untary? I tell my colleagues what will  happen. The 50 percent that I  talked  about who were  fortunate enough  to  have  preschool  readiness  programs,  that 50 percent, as soon as school A de cides to do the test, they are going to  demand that school B does  the  test,  ",1997
301,House,105,0.333,912,13,Mr. RIGGS.," Mr. Chairman,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume to  briefly observe that what this debate is  about is whether national testing is a  proper  role  for  the Federal Govern ment. As a former Governor himself, as  a  former head of  the National Gov ernors  Association,  the  President  should realize that he is intruding on  what is historically a State and local  responsibility. In fact, just last March  at a summit in Palisades, NY, the Na tion's Governors and prominent busi ness leaders reconfirmed their commit ment  to  developing State  standards  and State assessments  in  their own  States.

303,,105,-0.389,951,13,Mr. CAPPS.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  proclaim this the International Day of Peace.  Today  is  the  second  annual  celebration  hosted by the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation  in the city of Santa Barbara, CA.  It highlights  efforts by local organizations who are working  to bring peace to both Santa Barbara and the  global community.  The International Day of Peace was adopt ed by  the United Nations  in 1981  ""to com memorate and strengthen the ideals of peace  both within and among all nations and peo ple.""  As the Representative of the 22d district in  California and a former professor of Religious  Studies at University of Santa Barbara I strive  every day to achieve these goals.  Currently I am working to ban antipersonnel  land mines around  the world, devices which  kill or maim 26,000 people every year. I have  joined over 1 00 of my colleagues in cospon soring  the Land Mine Elimination Act which  will  halt  new  deployments  of U.S.  anti personnel mines beginning January 1st, in the  year 2000. As Andrew Feitt, the 9th grade stu dent who won the U.N. Association of Santa  Barbara essay contest so eloquently stated,  ""Landmines are a piece of military weaponry  designed to help end wars, but wars are tem porary, and most mines are not.""  As a member of the International Relations  Committee  I am also aware of the  important  role the United Nations plays in humanitarian  and peacekeeping efforts around  the world  and support the full payment of United States  dues to the U.N. Programs like UNICEF,  for  example, have helped  feed millions of chil dren. It would be devastating if missions which  help so many were crippled due  to  lack of  funding, and the United States must continue  to do its fair share.  Additionally, I believe that the security of our  Nation  requires an aggressive effort against  weapons of mass destruction. Since coming to  Congress  I have  taken a  leadership  role on  this issue. I have signed on to letters to Presi dent Clinton,  regarding deeper cuts  in our  strategic nuclear weapons arsenals and to ex press my concerns about the Department of  Energy's plans  to conduct underground sub critical nuclear weapons experiments at  the  Nevada Test Site. It is my belief that these ex periments could severely damage the not yet  ratified Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  Soon after I took office I sent Senate Major ity Leader TRENT Lon a letter urging swift ac tion on ratifying the Chemiqal Weapons Trea ty. Taking quick action and ratifying the treaty  afforded  the United States an  international  leadership role on a treaty that will prevent fu ture catastrophes involving chemical agents in  warfare. The only way to ensure our Nation's  long-term security and prosperity  is  to con tinue exerting American  leadership across a  range of military and humanitarian challenges  around the world.  So  I commend  the Nuclear Age Peace  Foundation for bringing us all together tonight,  19013  as we share a collective vision of peace. We  share a vision of a world  that  is  free of the  threat of war and where all individuals live with  human dignity, compassion and  respect  for  one another, a world  that we must strive  to  achieve on all the days of the year, if we hope  to attain these lofty and constructive goals and  to  increase  the possibilities  for peace  in  the  Nuclear Age.

305,House,105,-0.211,1081,13,Mr. POSHARD.," Mr. Speaker, a couple  of years ago I was asked to go to Bos nia with  14  other Members  of  the  United States Congress here to ascer tain  for  our  colleagues  here what  America's position should be  in  that  war-torn country. I was honored to go  there.  The first day we flew over to Serbia  and met with President Milosevic and  his people, and the second day we went  to Croatia  and met with President  Tudgman and his folks. The third day  we flew into Sarajevo, and not since I  had been an 18-year-old kid walking  around  the hills of Korea with  the  First Division had  I witnessed  such  devastation in a country.  0 1700  We landed at the airport, and guards  picked us up at the edge of the airport  property.  They  began  to  take  us  through town. People lived in burned out buildings and shells and bunkers  and basements, anywhere  they could  live. Eighty-six percent of the water  supply was gone in the city. Very little  food was getting in except through the  United Nations.  But I noticed as our bus was trav eling under heavy security throughout  state of Sarajevo, people began running  up from the bunkers and clapping, be cause they understood that there were  15 United States Congressmen visiting  their country who were going to have  something to say about their future.  We eventually prevailed upon secu rity to  let us stop in a  little square  where just a few months before a mor tar round from the surrounding moun tainside had killed 57 people. The secu rity said, no one will come out and talk  to you. They are too afraid. But by the  time we got off the bus, every street  filtering  into  that  little square was  filled with hundreds of people rushing  to the square to surround our bus.  This one elderly gentleman,  in  the  press of that crowd, grabbed me by the  arm and said something  to me  that  made such an  indelible  imprint upon  my mind I have never forgotten it to  this day. He said to me, after telling  me that he had lost every member of  his  family,  his wife was  gone,  his  brothers and sisters, his children, he  was alone in the world, he said to me,  with  tears streaming down his eyes,  Congressman, do you not understand  that we only trust America? We only  trust America.  In the press of the crowd, I did not  think  too much about his words. We  got back on the bus and went to our ap pointed rounds, and as we were flying  up  to Germany  to see  the  troops,  I  began to think about the words of that  old man. Some things in this business  you know innately in the gut.  He was not saying to me, Congress man, we only trust America's military  prowess,  or  America's  economic  strength. What he was saying  to me  was, Congressman, we only  trust  the  experience of America.  We live here in a multiracial, multi ethnic, multireligious society, and be cause we have chosen not to tolerate  each other's differences, we have killed  or maimed 200,000 of our people beyond  repair.  But we know America, and we know  the message of America to all of the  world, because you are  like us. You  came from every corner of the world,  with  different  values,  different  cul tures, different ethnicity, different re ligions. But  for  some  reason or an other, not perfectly so, you have made  it work better than anybody else in the  world,  because you  tolerate  the dif ferences among you. We trust you.  Two weeks to the day after I left that  old man in the streets of Sarajevo, I  stood before a  college class of 25 21year-old students in this country, who,  one by one, rose and looked me square  in the eye and said to me in no uncer tain  terms, Congressman, we do not  trust any of you people. You are all in  it for the special interests.  Mr. Speaker, to restore the trust in  this country between the Representa tive  and  the  represented, we must  enact campaign finance reform to re store confidence from our own children  and our government here.

Carter.  Wiley Carter died Thursday, September 11,  1997, in Jackson, MS. Wiley was a 1954 grad uate of Jackson Central High School and a  1958 graduate of Mississippi State University.  He served in State government during the ad ministration of Gov. John Bell Williams, 196872. At the time of his death at age 60, Wiley  served  as  administrative  assistant  for my  friend and colleague, Senator THAD COCHRAN.  He had  served with  THAD COCHRAN  since  197 4 when he was in his second term in the  U.S. House of Representatives.  Wiley loved Mississippi politics and govern ment service, and he worked diligently to help  the citizens of Mississippi. He was conscien tious, he had a great sense of humor, and he  was truly dedicated  to our State and  its citi zens. My staff, my family, and  I are shocked  and greatly saddened by the loss of this good  friend.  Wiley is irreplaceable and is truly an unfor gettable friend to those who knew him. Wiley  will be sorely missed both here in Washington  and, even more, back home in Mississippi. He  is survived by his wife, Gwen; sons, Craig and  Scott; and his daughter, Christy. Our thoughts  and prayers are with you.  Mr. Speaker and my colleagues in the U.S.  House of Representatives, I ask you again to  join me  in honoring Wiley Carter, his willing  sacrifice of his time and energy for the public  good, and his  representation of all  that  is  good, true and steadfast in our society.

309,,105,-0.465,1224,13,Ms. SLAUGHTER.," Mr. Speaker, as a co chair of the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus,  I am proud today to recognize the sixth anni versary of the  Independence of Ukraine. The  actual anniversary was celebrated on August  24, but today, we in Congress are commemo rating the occasion with a reception hosted by  the  caucus,  the Ukrainian Congress Com mittee of America, and the Ukrainian-American  Coordinating Council.  The past year has been an exciting, but  challenging one for Ukraine. As the representEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ative of a large and active Ukrainian commu nity  in Rochester, NY,  I particularly want  to  note  two milestones over  the past year  in  United States-Ukrainian relations.  This year we cemented the Ukrainian-Amer ican strategic partnership through the first ses sion of  the Ukraine-United States Binational  Kuchma-Gore Commission.  I am hopeful and  confident that this partnership will continue to  strengthen over the coming years.  Even more significantly, on July 9, the un precedented Charter on  the Distinctive Part nership  between NATO  and Ukraine was  signed at  the Madrid NATO  summit. This  ground-breaking agreement will serve as  the  basis for Ukraine's security into the 21st cen tury and demonstrates  the close relationship  that President Kuchma has built with Europe  and the United States.  As exciting as these developments are, over  the next year, we, the friends of Ukraine in the  United States, must  redouble our efforts  to  help Ukraine continue  to move  forward, par ticularly in the economic sphere. We must do  what we can  to support President Kuchma's  ongoing efforts to reform Ukraine's economy,  as he moves to integrate it into the world mar ket economy. In Ukraine itself, the March 1998  elections will be an opportunity to elect a re form-minded Parliament  to aid  in  this effort.  Here at home, I have been working  in Con gress to secure continued United States aid to  help Ukraine make this transition.  In addition,  the Ukrainian community and  other caring persons in the United States are  challenged  to continue  their magnificent, hu manitarian efforts to help relieve the still trou bling health conditions  for many Ukrainians,  particularly children. We must do what we can  to work together to lower infant mortality and  to  reverse  the  troubling  trends  toward  lower  life expectancy.  Yes, there is much work ahead, but Ukrain ians  in America have much  to celebrate as  well.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me  today  in saluting and congratulating Ukraine  and Ukrainian-Americans, as we commemo rate  the sixth anniversary of Ukrainian  inde pendence.

Within  the monument  are  175,000  acres  of  school trust lands. They contain vast  deposits of coal, large quantities of oil,  gas, and hard rock minerals. The total  value is in the billions of dollars.  A year ago,  the President stood in  Arizona and promised  that creating  this national monument  should not  and will not come at the expense of  Utah's children and vowed to create a  working group,  including Utah's con gressional delegation,  to find equiva lent lands for exchange. A year later,  no working group exists, no member of  the Utah  delegation  has  been  con tacted, and the Utah School Trust has  been unable to open negotiations.  Mr. President,  I ask for your help.  With 48 of my colleagues, I am sending  you today a letter asking for the cre ation of the promised working group.  The burden of your decision to create  the monument should not, and it must  not, fall on Utah's schoolchildren.  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER  PRO TEMPORE  The  SPEAKER  pro  tempore  (Mr.  HEFLEY). The Chair would remind the  gentleman  that Members  should ad dress the Chair and not the President.  BRING UP THE MENENDEZ  RESOLUTION  (Ms. KILPATRICK  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",1997
312,House,105,0.288,1237,13,Mr. WELLER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  rise  today to ask bipartisan support for a  new  legislative  initiative  called  the  Marriage Tax Elimination Act, legisla tion which will bring substantial tax  relief  to  over  21 million American  working couples who have been penal ized with higher  taxes  just because  they are married.  Let me ask this question of my col leagues on both sides of the aisle. Is it  fair  that  the  tradition of our most  basic institution in society, marriage,  is  punished  under  our  current Tax  Code? And is it fair, is it right, that it  is really to a married couple's advan tage to divorce and to live together be cause they would save money on taxes?  That  is  the current situation, Mr.  Speaker. Twenty-one million American  couples pay about $1,400 a year in high er taxes just because they are married.  That  is  approximately  equal  to  6  months' worth of car payments, tuition  for  a  child's  education  in parochial  school, or for mom or dad to go back to  a community college and pursue edu cation. It is unfair. It is wrong. Letme  share an editorial  in  the Kankakee  Daily Journal, a paper in my district.  ""The marriage tax is an unfair imposi tion. The Code should be rewritten to  eliminate it.""  I ask bipartisan support, and I ask  my colleagues to join with the 180 co sponsors of the Marriage Tax Elimi nation Act.  SUPPORT THE MENENDEZ  RESOLUTION  (Ms. VELAZQUEZ  asked  and was  given permission to address the House  for 1 minute.)  ",1997
313,House,105,-0.328,1250,13,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Chairman, I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I want to join the gen tleman  from Louisiana  [Mr. LIVING STON]  in the compliments he has paid  to the Members of this body that have  served on this joint committee on eth ics reform and to the staff that helped  us in order to reach this time.  I am very proud of the result of the  task  force. We  have an opportunity  today  to approve that product, and I  hope that this body will take that op portunity and approve the work of our  task force.  The gentleman from Louisiana pro vided  tremendous  leadership  in  this  body to bring together different people  of different views. We worked very hard  to compromise issues without compro mising principles, and we think the end  result is in the best interests of this  House. The challenge that we have is  to restore confidence with  the public  that we can carry out our constitu tional  responsibility  to monitor  the  conduct of our Members. It is a dif ficult responsibility.  0 1300  This body owes a debt of gratitude to  those Members who are willing to serve  on  the committee  that sits  in  judg ment. Several are on  the  floor here,  and I applaud  their efforts,  the gen tleman from Ohio  [Mr. SAWYER],  the  gentleman  from Utah  [Mr. HANSEN],  and others who have stepped forward to  carry out that awesome responsibility.  Because,  regardless of what rules we  have, ultimately it depends upon  the  willingness of Members of this House  to step forward,  to serve this body, to  judge its Members, and for us collec tively  to carry out that awesome re sponsibility.  I believe that the recommendations  of our bipartisan task force will make  it easier for us to carry out that awe some responsibility. It makes improve ments that are important to allow us  to judge the conduct of our Members.  Let me just, I guess, emphasize some of  the points  that  the gentleman  from  Louisiana [Mr. LIVINGSTON] has already  commented on.  The  recommendations,  if approved,  will make it easier for us  to have a  nonpartisan  operation  of  the  ethics  process.  The  resolution  specifically  provides  that  the  staff will be non partisan and cannot engage in partisan  political activities. The  recommenda tions give  the chairman and ranking  member equal opportunity to set the  agenda of the committee.  The  recommendations  improve  the  confidentiality of the work of the com mittee, which is so important to main tain the integrity of the process. The  ",1997

It is the perception  of the Chair that the gentleman from  Louisiana  [Mr.  LIVINGSTON]  and  the  gentleman  from  Maryland  [Mr.  CARDIN],  serving as managers of  the  bill under the terms of House Resolu tion 230, will have the right to close in  the event that they control time in op position to an amendment.

319,Senate,105,-0.223,1393,13,Mr. KERREY.," Mr. President, I wish  to inquire of my colleague from Wash ington State, Senator GORTON, chair man  of  the  Interior Appropriations  Subcommittee, on  the funding status  of health facility construction projects  within the Indian Health Service that  are  in  the  design  and  engineering  phase. Prior to the 1998 appropriations  process, the Congress had funded about  two-thirds of the design and engineer ing work  that  is necessary prior  to  begin construction of the new Winne bago Hospital. .This hospital, now over  70 years old, serves the Indian people in  northeast  Nebraska  and  northwest  Iowa. The Indian Health Service has in dicated  that another $650,000 will be  needed  to complete the design phase.  Does Senator GORTON share my under standing of this situation?  ",1997
320,Senate,105,0.31,1406,13,Mr. BOND.," Mr.  President,  I  rise  today to commend my colleague Sen ator GORTON on his amendment to pro vide kindergarten  through 12th grade  education  funding  directly  to  local  educational agencies. Last month,  I  traveled  through my home State of  Missouri to discuss education and the  importance of parent  involvement in  their child's education. I strongly be lieve that parents are the key to edu cational progress. As I visited with par ents, educators, and local school offi cials, they were in full agreement con cerning the education of our children;  they need  the  flexibility  to  improve  the quality of education at the  local  level without federal intrusion. As re sponsible parents and educators,  the  need  for our children  to be properly  educated was a top priority.  Over  the  last 30 years,  federal  in volvement in education has burgeoned  and I am disturbed by the growth of  federal  involvement  in what  is  con stitutionally the right of states: to pro vide for high-quality, public education.  This growth has been a wolf in sheep's  clothing:  states  and  localities  have  been offered additional funding in ex change  for adhering  to  federal  rules  and regulations. The result has been  that local school officials, who are di rectly accountable to parents, have ex perienced  increasingly  less  control  over education.  The Gorton amendment gives  local  schools  and States what  they have  been  requesting  for years:  the  flexi bility to develop challenging academic  standards and programs that works in  each locality. States and communities  are where the action should be in de signing standards and programs. It is  at those levels that disputes are most  likely  to be  resolved and  important  local priorities recognized. We must re turn  to  the  traditional  role of edu cation and reduce federal control.  States and local school districts are  making great strides in educating our  young people; however, the federal gov ernment cannot continue  to  impede  their ability to provide a high-quality  education which they are perfectly ca pable of doing. The Gorton amendment  sends us in the right direction, allow ing both parents and educators to work  together  for quality education.  It is  bringing education back where it be longs: at the local level. We have lost  too much already by the impositions of  the federal government, and it is time  to remedy this problem to prepare our  children for the 21st century.  This amendment will  ease  regula tions that prevent teachers, school ad ministrators, and parents from doing  what is best to improve their schools.  Our goal is to ensure that our children  are equipped with solid academic ba sics, which is learning to read, write,  compute, think, and speak. There is no  need to reinvent the wheel because we  know what works and that is parents,  teachers, and local communities work ing together to find local solutions to  local problems to educate our children.  We know  that our children could be  doing better and I want to ensure that  local  schools have every possible  re source to make that happen.  Mr. President,  the Gorton  amend ment will help  strengthen our  edu cational  system by  increasing  local  school districts' flexibility and funding  to improve the quality of education for  our children.  I am proud  to support  this  amendment  and  urge my  col leagues to adopt this provision in con ference.  NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR HUMANI'l'IES  ",1997
321,Senate,105,-0.25,1406,13,Mr. JOHNSON.," Mr. President, I rise  today to express my strong support for  the National Endowment for Human ities (NEH). While I am aware of the  national importance of the NEH, I am  particularly  supportive  of continued  federal funding for NEH because of the  regular and critical funding my state  of South Dakota receives. Grants from  NEH are vital to the people of my state  in preserving the rich and unique cul tural heritage of South Dakota and the  surrounding great plains states.  NEH programs exemplify the type of  federal-state-local  partnerships  that  have traditionally fostered a collective  dedication to cultural and historic edu cation. The NEH gives state human ities councils  the necessary freedoms  to meet local education needs. In the  last five years,  institutions in South  Dakota have received roughly $2.7 mil lion from the NEH and the South Da kota Humanities Council for a variety  of library programs and exhibits,  lit erary publications, and cultural herit age visitors centers.  The South Dakota Humanities Coun cil relies on the NEH for 90 percent of  its funding. That support goes directly  to schools and small communities for  projects  like  ""Calamity  Jane:  The  Woman and the Legend"" produced by  the Deadwood Historic Preservation  Commission, and ""Lakota: Language,  History, and Culture"" at the Bonesteel  Fairfax School. At  the  same  time,  broader educational projects continue  the literary legacy of many of this na tion's most acclaimed authors and long  time South Dakota residents, including  Laura Ingalls Wilder, who gave us the  ""Little House""  series, and L. Frank  Baum, author of the classic ""The Won derful Wizard of Oz."" This year, South  Dakota celebrated Baum's work with  the Wizard of Oz Festival  in Baum's  hometown of Aberdeen. This  festival  bloomed  into  a  statewide, year-long  celebration,  including  reading  pro grams in public schools, travelling edu cational programs, and symposiums in volving  scholarly  interpretations  of  Baum's work at state colleges and uni versities. This  far  reaching  festival  celebrating Frank Baum's  literature  was made  possible  through  several  NEH grants.  ",1997
322,,105,-0.303,1497,13,Mr. KANJORSKI.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  to pay  tribute  to Luzerne County Community  College, which is celebrating the 30th anniver sary of its founding this month.  I am pleased  and proud to have been asked to participate  in this significant celebration.  In 1965, the Luzerne County Board of Com missioners took a very bold step. They adopt ed a resolution  to sponsor a 2 year college  which would  be  affordable  to  all  Luzerne  County  residents. A study was needed and  the board called upon  the County Board of  School Directors  to  initiate planning of  the  project. In less than a year, an application was  made to the Pennsylvania State Board of Edu cation for permission to establish and operate  a community college. The State board granted  permission in September 1966.  Two months later, Luzerne County Commu nity College was  officially  in  operation. A  board of trustees was formed and a president  was appointed to lead the college. On October  2, 1967 the college opened  its doors for the  first time in small quarters located next to the  Hotel Sterling in downtown Wilkes-Barre. The  college's first class of 195 students graduated  in May 1969.  Mr. Speaker,  the  foresight of  the County  Commissioners;  Ed Wideman, William G.  Goss and James B. Post, 30 years ago has  made it possible for more than 13,000 young  people to begin a college career or earn a 2  year degree  for  professional  advancement.  Over 200 area businesses employ Luzerne  County Community College alumni.  In 1974, the college moved  to  its present  impressive  campus  in Nanticoke,  Pennsyl19559  vania. This modern campus includes an edu cational conference center, general academics  building and  two technical arts buildings with  state of the art labs and classrooms. The cam pus also includes medical and dental arts fa cilities and the newest addition, the advanced  technology center.  Mr. Speaker, Luzerne County Community  College has come a long way since its humble  beginnings  in  downtown Wilkes-Barre  30  years ago.  I am extremely proud to join with  the community  in commending  the board of  trustees, management, and staff of the college  in providing educational opportunity  to  thou sands of area residents.  I would also  like to  recognize  the Luzerne county commissioners  who have continued to play an active role in  supporting  this  important educational  institu tion.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring the his tory of this  fine  institution  to  the attention of  my  colleagues and  send my  sincere  best  wishes for continued success.  TRIBUTE TO JACOB GEORGE  HUDSON  HON. JOHN J. DUNCAN, JR.  OF TENNESSEE  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 18, 1997  ",1997
323,,105,0.6,1497,13,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker,  this  coming  Sunday, September 21, will be the 80th birth day of a truly outstanding American, my con stituent, Jacob George Hudson.  Mr. Hudson is affectionately known by all of  his friends and neighbors as ""Shag."" He has  been one of the leaders in Loudon County and  throughout the State of Tennessee for many  years.  Shag Hudson served  for 28 years on  the  Loudon County Commission,  from  1954  to  1982. During  this  time, he performed mar riages for over 3,000 couples.  He was also well known as a fighter for low  taxes and as one who tried to make sure that  the citizens got their moneys' worth  for  their  tax dollars.  Mr. Hudson has proudly operated a farm in  the Greenback community  for  the past 65  years,  raising beef cattle and working as a  self-employed cattle broker.  He served with great distinction for 5 years  as a member of the State Committee of Agri cultural  Stabilization  Conservation  Service  from 1987 to 1992.  He began serving the Merchants and Farm ers Bank in 1973 and presently serves as a  director of Union Planter Bank.  He has been a member of Greenback Ma sonic Lodge for 49 years, and he is a master  mason.  He has been a member of  the Loudon  County Farm Bureau since 1944, and he has  been a member and director of the Loudon  County Livestock Association since 1970.  He also serves as a director of Tellico Area  Services System, and he has been church  treasurer, elder, and deacon at First Pres byterian Church of Greenback.  Shag Hudson's greatest pride and joy is not  in his community service, however, as great  as that has been. Rather, it is in his family. He  ",1997
324,,105,-0.509,1510,13,Mr. NADLER.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today to  recognize the 50th anniversary of the School  of Visual Arts, located  in my district  in New  York City. The School of Visual Arts was es tablished  in 1947 by Silas Rhodes and has  since grown to be the largest independent col lege of the arts in the country. The school has  a student population drawn  from 44 States  and 53 countries, and a faculty comprised of  full-time working professionals.  Mr. Rhodes, who has continued as director,  founded the school on  the  idea of combining  access to the professional world of art with su perior art education. He has accomplished this  by bringing working artists into the classroom.  As  instructors, these professional artists offer  the students a solid foundation in craft as well  as exposure  to current art world expression.  Working toward this goal, the school also has  four art galleries, including one in the heart of  SoHo, a visual arts museum, a radio station,  and it offers students in the film and video de partment more hands-on experience than any  other comparable degree program. Addition ally, with the rapid advancement in computer  technology  and  influence  on  the working  world, the School of Visual Arts has  impres sively kept up to pace. The school became the  first college  to offer both a bachelor degree  and a master of fin~ arts degree in computer  art and maintains a 1-to-1 student to computer  ratio.  The School of Visual Arts offers both under graduate and graduate degrees  in  the  tradi tional fine arts, but has expanded the study of  art to include advertising, graphic design, ani mation, art education, computer art, film and  video, illustration and cartooning, interior de sign, photography, and art therapy. In addition  to  the  full-time students,  there are currently  more  than 4,000 members of the community  taking advantage of the continuing education  classes that are offered. The art education de partment also provides art classes  to public  school children from all five boroughs of New  York City. The school also participates in nu merous volunteer art projects, serving commu nities who otherwise have very little access to  the arts.  In celebration of the School of Visual Arts  50th anniversary, the school will present Art  Awareness Week, designed to inform the pub lic about the importance of art in society and  about  the different variations of art.  In  the  coming months the school will host 45 events  throughout the city and has published a book  entitled  ""School  of Visual Arts Gold: Fifty  Years of Creative Graphic Design.""  I would  like to congratulate the school on 50 years of  excellence  in art education. .I am proud  to  have this fine institution in my district.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY  HON. BENJAMIN A. GILMAN  OF NEW YORK  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 18, 1997  ",1997
325,,105,0.043,1510,13,Mr. GILMAN.," Mr. Speaker, I rise  today  to  remind my colleagues of  the  importance of  National POW/MIA Recognition Day, which  falls on September 19, 1997. I urge my col leagues to participate in recognizing America's  heroes, those who are presumed missing  in  action.  Our Nation has fought six major conflicts in  its history. In those wars, over 500,000 Ameri cans have been taken prisoner of war. Those  service men and women experienced numer ous hardships and treatment which could often  be  described  only  as  barbaric  during  the  course of captivity. Those Americans  impris oned by  the Japanese during World War  II  faced the worst possible conditions in captivity  and were  firsthand witnesses to the utter de pravity of their fellow men.  I have been a strong advocate of an ac counting of our POW/MIA's since I first came  to the Congress in 1973. I proudly supported  the creation of the Select Committee on Miss ing Persons  in Southeast Asia, the National  POW/MIA Recognition Days, and POW/MIA  legislation because  I believe  the  families of  those who are missing  in action deserve no  less. Hopefully 1996 will be the last year that  such an occasion will be necessary. My hope  is that by this time next year, our Government  will have obtained a full accounting of those  brave American's whose  fates, at  this  time,  are still unknown.  Permit me  to  focus special  recognition on  those POW/MIA's  from Korea and Vietnam.  Despite  the administration's best assurances  to  the contrary, many of us  remain uncon vinced  that the Governments of North Korea  and Vietnam have been fully cooperating with  the United States on  this  issue. Regrettably,  by normalizing  relations with Vietnam,  I be lieve  that we have withdrawn our  leverage  over  the Vietnamese Government  on  this  issue.  In recent years, we have learned from testi mony presented to congressional committees  that Soviet and Czech military doctors per formed ghastly medical experiments on United  States POW's in North Korea during the Ko rean war. These experiments were used  to  test the psychological endurance of American  Gl's, as well as  their resistance to chemical,  biological, and  radioactive agents. Moreover,  Soviet and Czech  intelligence agents helped  organize shipments of POW's to the U.S.S.R.  during  the Vietnam war, and  that 200 were  sent between 1961 and 1968.    It is my hope that this  information will  lead  to a further clarification regarding the safe re turn of any living POW's who may still be  in  captivity in Korea or elsewhere.  Americans should bear in mind the  love of  country  that America's veterans have dem onstrated as well as their personal sacrifices,  convictions, and dedication  to  freedom  that  they have courageously exhibited.  In a portion of President Abraham Lincoln's  letter to a mother who  lost five sons on  the  battlefield, he stated:  ""I cannot  refrain  from  September 18, 1997  tendering  to you  the  thanks of the Republic  they died to save. I pray that our Heavenly Fa ther may assuage  the anguish of your be reavement, and  leave you only the cherished  memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn  pride that must be yours to have laid so costly  a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.""  May it be of some solace to the families and  loved ones of our missing and POW's  that  there are many of us  in  the Congress com mitted  to a  full and  final accounting of our  missing and will continue to seek such a reso lution.  DEPARTMENTS  OF  LABOR,  HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,  AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED  AGENCIES  APPROPRIATIONS  ACT, 1998  SPEECH OF  HON. LANE EVANS  OF ILLINOIS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 17, 1997  The House  in Committee of  the Whole  House on the State of the Union had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 2264) making ap propriations for the Departments of Labor,  Health and Human Services, and Education,  and related agencies, for the fiscal year end ing September 30, 1998, and  for other pur poses:  ",1997
326,,105,-0.454,1510,13,Mr. EVANS.," Mr. Chairman, the House of  Representatives passed  the  fiscal year 1998  Labor-HHS Appropriations Act. Included in the  bill is a provision that deserves the support of  every Member of Congress who wants to as sist our Persian Gulf war veterans.  The provision, authored by Representative  BERNARD SANDERS, would provide $7 million  over 5 years to the Department of Health and  Human Services to use both the expertise of  the National  Institute of Environmental Health  Sciences and the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention to study the possible connec tion between chemical and biological expo sures and  the mysterious ailments being suf fered by our gulf war veterans. Representative  SANDERS deserves much credit for his efforts  to ensure that we thoroughly investigate what  is making our veterans sick.  This provision comes at a time when more  and more people are becoming convinced that  chemical weapons may have played a sub stantial role in the  illnesses that are afflicting  Persian Gulf veterans. Just recently, the Presi dential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Vet erans' Illnesses agreed to revise its final report  to  reflect  that chemical weapons may have  played some role in veterans' ailments. In ad dition, the  final  report will now say  that  re search on the effect of chemical weapons ex posure has been minimal and that it may take  years of  research  to clarify  the  causes of  these problems.  I believe  that we cannot  leave any stone  unturned  in  trying  to  find answers. As DOD  continues to revise upward the number of vet erans who may have been exposed to chem ical weapons, it's obvious that we cannot allow  our Government to do a minimal job of inves tigating what is becoming a compelling possi bility.  ",1997
327,House,105,-0.509,231,18,Mr. NADLER.," Madam Speaker, since  NAFTA we have converted a $2 billion  trade surplus with Mexico to a $20 bil lion  trade deficit.  In 65  percent of  union organizing elections, employers  have threatened to move to Mexico or  to another foreign country if workers  have chosen the advantages of collec tive bargaining.  Working people have gotten almost  none of the benefits of our expanding  economy, as real wages for the middle  class have  remained static and,  for  lower-income workers, have actually  declined. NAFTA and fast track quite  properly protect American  investors  who invest abroad and protect intellec tual property rights, but they do not  protect  labor  and  environmental  rights. They are imbalanced.  We must have balanced trade agree ments  that protect not only  invest ments and  intellectual property, but  also labor and environmental standards  if trade is to serve all our people, and  if our expanding trade is not to serve  as a tool to be used to deny a fair share  of our economic gains from  filtering  down  to working people and  to  the  middle  class. Reject  the  fast  track  agreement as imbalanced.  D 1430  INVESTIGATION OF 1996  PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN  (Mr. TIAHRT asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1997
328,House,105,0.449,231,18,Mr. TIAHRT.," Madam Speaker, inves tigations  into crimes  that may have  been committed during the 1996 Presi dential campaign are about a lot more  than taking foreign money. They are a  lot more  than  just  the effort  to se cretly get around the rules that every one else had to follow and then worry  about explaining the misdeeds after the  election.  No, Madam  Speaker,  the  liberal  media attempts to downplay this scan dal.  These  investigations  are  also  about compromising national security,  about selling out American foreign pol icy to the highest bidder and acting in  complicity with the Communist Gov ernment of China to subvert the demo cratic process in the United States.  I believe that I am correct, Madam  Speaker, that both Democrats and Re publicans  would  agree  that  these  charges are truly alarming. In fact, all  Americans who believe in democracy,  who believe  that America should de cide who should rule over America and  who believe  that secret money  laun dering operations  represent political  corruption at its most disgraceful, all  believe that we must find out the truth  about  these scandals. Democracy de mands it.  IN TRIBUTE TO THE LATE CLARA  BOSWELL  (Mrs. CLAYTON asked and was given  permission to address the House for 1  minute.)  ",1997

Clearly, much more needs to be done  before we can assert that our Nation's  food  laws have been completely  re formed. However, this is a responsible  down payment of food reform that we  can expect to benefit public health.

337,House,105,0.6,335,18,Mr. DUNCAN.," Mr. Speaker,  I yield  myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker,  the Subcommittee. on  A via ti on unanimously approved H.R.  2476, as amended, on Thursday, October  23, and the full Cammi ttee on Trans portation and Infrastructure approved  the bill on October 29. This legislation  was introduced by the gentleman from  Guam [Mr. UNDERWOOD]  shortly after  the terrible Air Korea disaster wh.ich  recently occurred on Guam. Both the  gentleman from Illinois [Mr. LIPINSKI],  the  ranking member  of  the  sub committee, and I, are original cospon sors of the bill.  It essentially mirrors  legislation in  the Aviation Disaster Family Assist ance Act, R.R. 3823, which  the Sub committee on Aviation unanimously  approved and  the House overwhelm ingly supported by a vote of 401  to 4  last year. This legislation was eventu ally  incorporated  into  the  Federal  Aviation Administration Reauthoriza tion Act which the President signed in  October of last year.  H.R. 2476 would require foreign air lines that have permits to fly in the  United States to file family assistance  plans with  the Department of Trans portation and the National Transpor tation Safety Board. These assistance  plans would be activated when a  for eign carrier crashes on U.S. soil.  The plans must  include provisions  such as the establishment of a toll-free  telephone number for families, the effi cient notification of passengers' fami lies before public notice is given,  the  return of victims' possessions to family  members, unless  they are needed for  the  investigation,  and many  other  similar provisions which all U.S. car riers must comply with now.  H.R. 2476 will surely help the families  who have lost loved ones in these trag ic air disasters by providing the needed  support and coordination necessary to  assist in these unfortunate events.  Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding  that  the Senate Committee on Com merce has already acted on similar leg islation. This bill has  the support of  both the Department of Transportation  and the National Transportation Safe ty Board. Again,  I believe  this  is an  outstanding bill,  a bill  that  is very  much needed, and I urge its adoption.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.  ",1997

Mr. Speaker, I waht to say my friend  from California has, I believe, made a  statement  that was  inaccurate. The  point of this bill, R.R. 2920, is not to  eliminate  an  entry-exit  system but  simply to make the system more work able.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman  from New York  [Mr. LA FALCE].  ",1997
339,House,105,0.492,348,18,Mr. SOLOMON.,"  H.R. 2920 would delay the implementation of  (P.L. 104Section 11 O of the Illegal Immigration Reform  and  Immigrant Responsibility Act  208) at  land-based border entry ports  from  October 1, 1998, to October 1, 1999. Section  11 O requires the Immigration and Naturaliza tion Service [INS]  to  implement an entry-exit  system at all entry points to the U.S. H.R 2920  would  still  require  the  INS  to  implement an  entry-exit system at U.S. airports and seaports  by October 1, 1998, and would also  require  the INS  to implement Section 11 O in such a  way that would not significantly disrupt or im peded trade or tourism.  I was a proud supporter of immigration re form  last year, and believe that an entry-exit  system should be an integral part of U.S. ef forts to address illegal  immigration. However,  I believe Congress should provide the INS ad ditional time to implement Section 11 O at land based border entry points. There are simply  too many  land-based  entry points  into  the  U.S., six in my district, for  the  INS  to  imple ment an entry-entry system by the end of next  year. Allowing  the  INS  to first  implement an  entry-exit system at U.S. airports and seaports  should give the INS additional time to  imple ment an entry-exit system in such a way that  would not cause unnecessary delays at border  crossing. Mr. SPEAKER,  there have been nu merous  legislative proposals  to address con cern about Section 110, and I have been sup portive  of  legislative  corrections  to Section  It  is possible  that Congress will  pass  such corrective legislation next year, but I be lieve this is too important an issue to leave un resolved until then.

The editorial highlights  the growing  interest  in  the Lewis and Clark  Expedition  and  the  upcoming  bicentennial  celebrations  to commemorate  the bold and  courageous  journey. As someone who has  had a longstanding interest in  the Lewis and  Clark Expedition, this Member  is pleased  to  promote  the bicentennial efforts  through  the  introduction earlier this year of two pieces of  legislation. H.R. 1560 authorizes the U.S. Mint  to produce a commemorative coin honoring  the Expedition. Proceeds from the sale of the  coins will be used to fund the activities of the  National Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Council  and the National Park Service.  This Member has also  introduced House  Resolution 144, a resolution  to express sup port  for  the Bicentennial of  the Lewis and  Clark Expedition. This resolution highlights the  importance of  the expedition and expresses  congressional support for the commemorative  activities of the National Lewis and Clark Bi centennial Council as well as Federal, state  and local entities and other interested groups.  We must continue to recognize the ongoing  legacy of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The  upcoming bicentennial activities will provide  excellent opportunities  to  stress  the  impor tance of the journey's mission and discoveries.

342,,105,0.423,426,18,Mr. BAKER.," Mr. Speaker, today I am intro ducing  the Electronic Financial Services EttiEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  ciency Act of 1997. This bill  is designed  to  provide a uniform nationwide framework to en courage the use and validity of electronic au thentication.  New forms of electronic communication are  being utilized as an alternative to paper-based  documentation  and  correspondence. Com puters are now routinely used to  initiate and  execute a substantial and growing number of  personal, business, and financial transactions.  As a result, the problem of authenticating the  identity and  the  signature of parties using  computers has become a major concern. Un less a reliable alternative to written signatures  is acknowledged,  the promise of electronic  commerce will not be fully realized.  State  legislatures  have  recognized  this  need. At the present time 30 States have en acted or have introduced some form of digital  authentication law. Unfortunately, these State  statutes lack uniformity both in scope and ap plication. Electronic communications and com merce take place on the Internet or elsewhere  in  cyberspace. Therefore, State boundaries  have little relevance and conflicting State elec tronic authentication  laws may ultimately  in hibit the development of electronic commerce.  The bill  I am  introducing today is designed  to address  the  issue of conflicting and con fusing developments under current and pro posed State  law. The purpose of  the Elec tronic  Financial  Services Efficiency Act  of  1997 is threefold: First, to provide for the rec ognition of digital and other forms of authen tication as an alternative  to existing paper based methods, second, to  improve  the effi ciency and soundness of the Nation's capital  markets and payment system, and  third,  to  harmonize  the practices, customs and uses  applicable  to electronic authentication on a  uniform, nationwide basis.  The  first goal  is accomplished by explicitly  recognizing  that all  forms of electronic com merce that comport with specific, basic statu tory standards shall have parity with written  signatures. As a result, they will be considered  valid  for  all  communications with  Federal  agencies, U.S. Courts and other instrumental ities of the U.S. Government.  In order to minimize confusion and encour age  uniform national  treatment, unless  the  laws of a State otherwise expressly provide,  all forms of electronic authentication that com port with the Federal statutory standards shall  have the same standing as written signatures  for all legal purposes.  The second goal  is met by  the establish ment of  the National Association of Certifi cation Authorities  [NACA]. Any  person  or  group  that wishes  to provide electronic au thentication services in the United States must  be a  registered NACA member. The NACA  may admit any person or group  to member ship, provided  they are  licensed and provide  electronic  authentication  services  consistent  with the standards set forth in this act.  The third goal is met by the creation of an  Electronic Authentication Standards Review  Committee within the NACA. Overseen by the  Secretary of the Treasury, the Standards Re view Committee shall establish, develop, and  refine criteria to be applied to new electronic  authentication methods, consistent with  the  specific standards set  forth  in  the Electronic  Financial Services Efficiency Act of 1997.  November 9, 1997  Recognizing  that digital authentication will  be used  in  retail  transactions, this  legislation  requires that consumers be notified of the fact  that an  electronic  communication or  trans action has been digitally authenticated. Fur thermore,  the act states  that any rights cur rently afforded  to  consumers  in  underlying  transactions are not in any manner impaired  or weakened. Additionally, the Standards Re view Committee has the authority to address  consumer protection by exercising  its  rulemaking and enforcement powers. .  .  .  Mr. Speaker,  I believe  that  this  leg1slat1on  will authorize and validate  the use of elec tronic authentication. It will also encourage in novation and stimulate competition in the de sign and use of reliable state-of-the-art digital  technology.  RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF  ALICE PETROSSIAN  HON. JAME'S E. ROGAN  OF CALIFORNIA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Saturday, November 8, 1997  ",1997

Now  more  than  ever, we must encourage  our  teachers to be their best, push our students to  work  hard  and  set  goals,  and  invest  in  strengthening our education system. Recently,  this dear friend and educator was awarded the  Professional of the Year award by the Arme nian Professional Society  for  her ongoing  commitment as an educator.  Alice began her career at California State  University  Los  Angeles,  earning  both  her  bachelor's and master's degree before head ing  to California State University Hayward  to  pursue her  teaching credential. He work  to ward excellence in education was recognized  early on as she received the Most Outstanding  Graduate award at both schools.  Alice  then moved back  to southern Cali fornia where  she became actively  involved  with the Glendale Unified School District serv ing recently as the director of special projects  and  intercultural programs. She has received  much recognition for her service, and her tal ents have been called upon by each of  the  last three Governors of California.  Alice has served on the California Commu nity College Board,  the California Post Sec ondary Education Board, and has worked with  the Commission for the Establishment of Aca demic Content and Standards to ensure that  quality curricula are united with well-prepared  teachers offering our children  the  tools nec essary for the future.  Alice's most  important work goes beyond  any committee or board on which she might  serve. Since her arrival  in Glendale, she has  reached out  to students of all backgrounds.  Alice has put  faith  in at-risk students, and  those that might slip through the cracks.

344,,105,-0.328,504,18,Mr. CARDIN.," Mr. Speaker,  today  I  intro duced legislation to provide new tools for the  enforcement of child support orders in this Na tion. In the process of shaping the 1996 com prehensive welfare reform bill  it became clear  that effective child support enforcement was  among the best means this Nation has to end  welfare as we know  it. The bill  I introduced  today will assist State and Federal officials in  dealing with  some of  their  toughest delin quency cases.  This  legislation would establish  tough en forcement measures  for dealing with  foreign  nationals who are noncustodial parents with  children  living  in  this Nation. The bill would  deny entry visas and residency status to those  falling more  than $5,000 behind  in court-or dered child support payments. In addition, nat uralization could not take place until one is in  compliance with support orders. The bill would  allow these foreigners to attend court hearings  and other related legal proceedings in this Na tion.  It also provides new authority  for immi gration officers  to serve court orders, sum mons, and other legal process at the border when we best know the whereabouts of for eign nationals.  These provisions are similar to existing child  support enforcement measures  imposed on  November 10, 1997  U.S. citizens, such as  the denial of drivers  and/or other professional  licenses, as well as  passports. These penalties also generally be come  applicable when  one  is more  than  $5,000 behind  in payments. This  issue was  brought to my attention by a constituent who  could not collect ordered payments from a for eign national, though the  irresponsible parent  regularly traveled in and out of this country on  business. As we make it tough on Americans  who are irresponsible, we should do the same  with foreign nationals.  I urge my colleagues to join me in support  of this legislation to provide new tools for child  support enforcement. I would also ask that the  text of the legislation be printed in the RECORD  at this point.  TRIBUTE TO MARILYN DONLIN  HON. SANDER M.

Just 2 weeks ago, while  traveling home  after visiting his  father,  this gentleman came  upon  the scene of an accident. A car had  struck a  tree and caught fire. Surveying  the  situation, Mr. Morrow witnessed two people in  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  the auto. Risking his own life, he began a dar ing  rescue attempt of the occupants, quickly  pulling the passenger to safety.  He then returned to the vehicle to free the  driver, who, semi-conscious and bleeding pro fusely from head wounds, was trapped in the  crumpled wreckage. With  flames  lapping  the  driver's feet, Mr. Morrow struggled to rip open  the door and drag the man across the street.  He then used his own clothing to smother the  flames burning the driver.  Only seconds  later,  the car exploded,  rip ping apart the front section of the auto, where  only moments earlier the driver lay dying.  Responding to the scene, police referred to  Mr. Morrow as a hero. Mr. Speaker, Richard  Morrow's actions were heroic. Without any  concern for his own personal safety, he calmly  took charge of a life-threatening situation and  saved  the  lives of William Burgess and his  passenger Wayne Curtis. I ask all of my col leagues to join me in commending Mr. Morrow  for his actions.  A TRIBUTE TO THE CREW OF THE  U.S.S. BULLHEAD (SS-332)  HON. MARCY KAP11JR  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Sunday, November 9, 1997  ",1997
346,,105,-0.35,517,18,Ms. KAPTUR.," Mr. Speaker, although  the  end of the Second World War occurred over  a half-century ago, Americans still honor and  continue to remember the hundreds of thou sands of men and women who paid the ulti mate sacrifice  in this,  the greatest conflict of  all human history.  I would  like  to take  this  time  to honor the  brave men who served on the U.S.S. Bullhead  (SS-332). The U.S.S. Bullhead was  the  last  major vessel  lost by  the United States  in  World War II, and with it went the lives of 84  American sailors.  On August 6, 1945,  the U.S.S. Bullhead  was plying the waters of the Java Sea when  it was suddenly attacked by Japanese aircraft,  which proceeded to drop 500-pound bombs on  the American submarine. Although presumed   to have been sunk,  the actual  fate of  the  U.S.S. Bullhead could not be determined.  On August 23, 1945,  the U.S. Navy an nounced that ""The U.S.S. Bullhead is overdue  and presumed lost."" The U.S.S. Bullhead was  the 52d U.S. submarine lost during World War  11.  It wasn't until long after the end of the war  that  the  fate of the U.S.S. Bullhead and  its  crew was learned following the release of Jap anese records.  Mr. Speaker,  in honoring  the crew of  the  U.S.S. Bullhead,  I wish to extend special ap preciation to Mr. Richard L. Henshaw of To ledo, OH, who has strived  to maintain  the  memory and honor of this submarine and  its  gallant crew.  Mr.  Speaker,  I wish  to  include  for  RECORD  the  following official history of  U.S.S. Bullhead.  Bullhead (SS-332) was laid down on 21 Octo ber 1943 at Groton, Conn., by  the Electric  Boat Co.; launched on 16 July 1944; sponsored  by Mrs. Howard Doyle; and commissioned on  4 December 1944, Comdr. Walter T. Griffith in  command.  the  the  26007  Following a month's shakedown cruise in  Narragansett Bay, the submarine sailed on 9  January 1945 for Key West, Fla., where she  received two weeks of additional training be fore pushing on  to Panama. She emerged  from the canal on 11 February and headed for  Hawaii. On the first day out, a near disaster  occurred. During a practice dive,  the main  induction failed to close rapidly enough be cause of low hydraulic pressure, and tons of  water flooded in before it could be shut. The  ship was saved by shifting ballast, pumping  out water, and continuing the dive. She pro ceeded  on without  incident  and  reached  Pearl Harbor on 26 February.  At the end of her voyage repairs, Bullhead  left Pearl Harbor on 9 March. Ten days later,  she paused at Guam to refuel and then got  underway on the 21st for the northern port of  the South China Sea and her first war patrol.  The submarine hunted off Formosa through  30 March without encountering any enemy  ships before shaping a course for Hong Kong.  En route, she shelled targets on enemy-occu pied Pratas Island. While off Hong Kong, she  also provided  lifeguard services  for Allied  aviators. On 8 April,  an American  ""Lib erator"" mistakenly bombed Bullhead. All the  bombs missed her, fortunately, by at least 75  yards and, while severely shaken, she sus tained no damage.  On 16 April, four miles off the China coast,  the  submarine  recovered  the  crew  of  a  downed Army aircraft, taking on board three  survivors and the bodies of three casualties.  The submarine terminated the patrol on 28  April in the Philippines when the safely ar rived at the newly constructed base at Subic  Bay, Luzon.  Upon completion of her refit there, Bull head spent eight days in training exercises  off the coast of Luzon before getting under way again on 21 May for her second war pa trol. This time, the submarine operated in a  wolf pack with Bergall (SS-320) and Kraken  (SS-370) in a coordinated sweep of the Gulf of  Siam and the Java Sea.  Bullhead entered the patrol area on 25 May  but encountered no suitable targets until 30  May, when she made a machinegun attack  on a 150-ton schooner and claimed to have  sunk the Japanese vessel. On 4 June, the sub marine moved  to a new  station south of  Anabas Island, but this area proved  to be  barren.  On the 16th, she entered the western end of  the Java Sea, Bullhead discovered her next  victim on the 18th. Once again, she trained  her machine guns on a maru, a 700-ton vessel  which sank soon after suffering a hit at the  waterline. Later  that day,  the  submarine  sighted a small convoy of two merchantmen  and two escort vessels but was unable to at tack because the ships took shelter along the  Java coast.  On  the morning of the 19th, Bullhead en gaged  in  a  surface battle with  two  sub chasers and two picket boats and took credit  for sinking one 700-ton subchaser and dam aging a smaller one of some 500 tons. The re maining Japanese vessels tried to take cover  behind a point of land, but Bullhead closed  the shore and continued firing on the boats.  The encounter did not end until  the sub marine exhausted her supply of 5-inch am munition.  On 25 June, Bullhead opened fire with her  40-millimeter gun on a small Japanese ves sel, set the boat ablaze, and believed that the  Japanese boat had been sunk. She completed  this patrol on 2 July when she moored at  Fremantle, Australia.  Despite claiming to have sunk several ves sels, Bullhead was not officially  credited  ",1997
347,House,105,0.416,543,18,Mr. SHUSTER.," Mr. Speaker, I thank  my good  friend  the gentleman  from  New York [Mr. SOLOMON]  for yielding  me the time.  Mr. Speaker,  I am sure it is well known  that from  the very beginning  my objective has been to save Amtrak,  although there are some in this body  and the other body who would just as  soon see it go into bankruptcy. And to  save it, we have said from  the begin ning that we need to change the labor  protection, we need  to reform it, we  need to reform liability. And there are  other things as well which we believe  need to be done.  But the labor provisions and the li ability provisions are very, very cru cial. And, indeed, the Senate has acted.  There are provisions in those areas of  labor reform and liability reform and  contracting out, which  is a subset of  labor, that are not as strong as many  would like them to be, but, neverthe less,  they are acceptable. So  the big gest stumbling blocks that have been  before us are, indeed, now acceptable.  There is, however, at least one addi tional factor which is of extreme importance. And in a few moments, I will  add an entirely new dimension to the  extraordinary importance of our deal ing with a restructuring of the board.  Many of us believe, and of course we re spect the other body, but the last time  we checked the Constitution, this was  a bicameral legislature. This House is  not a potted plant. We have an obliga tion to do what we believe is right as  well, and then work together with the  other body in attempting to craft an  acceptable compromise.  The one area in which we have great  difficulty is in the area of the structure  of the board. We believe that for the  proposed reforms to be meaningful, to  actually be put in place, that we must  have a board of directors which is a  more  independent, more business-ori ented board of directors. And so,  to  that end, that is exactly what we have  proposed.  It is, interestingly, ironically essen tially what my good  friend  the gen tleman  from Minnesota  [Mr.  OBER STAR],  the  ranking Democrat of  the  committee, proposed in the legislation  as it was working its way through the  committee. So  this  is not something  that is dropped on us out of the sky. It  is something which in the past has had  bipartisan  support. Nevertheless, we  are told that there is opposition to it  now.  I point out that our proposal gives  the President the ability to appoint the  seven members  in some consul ta ti on  with the leaders of the House and the  Senate. We  think that is reasonable,  and we support that. However, and let  me emphasize this, there is an entirely  new dimension to this entire issue now,  and that new dimension, which I have  just been made aware of,  is that the  Justice Department  says  that  the  makeup of the board in the Senate bill  coming to us is unconstitutional. Let  me  repeat  that. The Justice Depart ment informs us that the makeup of  the board as coming to us in the Sen ate bill is unconstitutional. It violates  the appointments clause.  That adds a whole new dimension to  this debate. It is no longer a question  of whether we simply think our struc ture of the board  is better  than  the  structure  of  the board proposed by  somebody else. It is beyond our con trol. The Justice Department says it is  unconstitutional.  As  chairman of  the  committee,  I  would be derelict in my duties if I were  to bring this bill  to  the floor  recog nizing that it has been said by the Jus tice Department that what I bring to  the  floor  is unconstitutional. There fore, unless we can get agreement,  I  shall not bring this bill  to  the floor.  Unless we can get agreement, I will im mediately move to hold hearings that  deal with the constitutionality to in vite  the Justice Department to come  up and testify. And only when we can  satisfy ourselves that whatever we do  ",1997

351,House,105,0.282,621,18,Mr. DAVIS of Virginia.," Mr. Speaker,  I appreciate my friend the gentleman  from  Pennsylvania  [Mr.  GEKAS]  for  yielding me the time, and I appreciate  his efforts to move this to the floor be fore adjournment.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of  the proposed amendments  to  the  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit  Authority, WMATA,  Interstate Com pact. The amendments under consider ation have been enacted by all signato ries of the WMATA compact, Virginia,  Maryland  and District of Columbia.  The Bipartisan Area Delegation  is  seeking congressional consent  to  the  proposed  amendments, which  passed  the Committee on  the  Judiciary by  voice vote earlier this year.  The amendments would allow the Au thority to conduct its business more ef ficiently and effectively. This is an ef fort  to  streamline  the Authority's  practices and  to provide  for an en hanced level of protection for the Tran sit Authority's  police  officers.  The  amendments will both protect the pub lic right to have input in the region's  transit decision-making process as well  as enhance the public safety through out the region.  To be more specific, the first amend ment modifies the Authority's current  public hearing process relating to fare  increases and changes in transit serv ice. The proposal will bring  the Au thority  into  conformity with  other  transit properties that follow Federal  public  hearing  standards  that have  been in place since 1982. Currently the  Authority's  public hearing practices  are far broader than Federal guidelines  and inhibits the ability of the Transit  Authority  to  respond  to  market  changes  in an  efficient businesslike  manner.  Under the proposed amendments, the  Authority will continue to be required  to hold public hearings on proposals to  raise fares or implement major service  reductions. However,  the Authority  will not be  required  to hold public  hearings  for minor  service  changes,  thus enabling WMA TA to adjust to the  needs of the riding public in a quick  fashion.  The  other major  change  to  the  WMATA compact is removal of com pact  language  that currently  limits  WMATA's  transit police  to carrying  their service weapon only when  they  are on duty or in direct transit to and  from duty assignments. Consent to the  proposal will allow the transit police to  join every other police force in the re gion, including the Capitol Hill police,  in  authorizing  its  officers  to  carry  weapons during off-duty hours.  reserve  As the former chairman of the Fair fax County Board of Supervisors, I can  tell my colleagues that the transit po lice are among the best-trained forces  in the region. They deserve to have the  ability to defend themselves during off duty hours. It is an unfortunate reality  that the transit police are also dealing  with a violence-prone criminal element  who sometimes seek revenge after they  have been apprehended. We need to re spect  the  transit  police,  authorize  them to carry their weapons that they  have been  trained  to use, and  trust  that  the extensive  training  that  the  transit police receive will serve them  well if they are confronted during off duty hours.  These amendments are important to  the daily workings of the Washington  Metropolitan Transit Authority  and  the safety of its police officers. I urge  my colleagues to support this consent  resolution.  ",1997
352,House,105,-0.302,621,18,Mr. MORAN of Virginia.," Mr. Speak er,  the gentleman from Pennsylvania  [Mr. GEKAS],  the gentleman from New  York [Mr. NADLER], as well as the dis tinguished  gentleman  from Virginia  [Mr. DAVIS], who just spoke, have ade quately described what this bill will do.  So out of consideration for the pressing  time demands of the gentleman from  Pennsylvania [Mr. MURTHA], I will keep  my remarks as brief as possible.  I will only say that this is a common sense  bill  that will  save  time  and  money. It will improve customer serv ice and security for those who use the  Washington Metropolitan Transit sys tem. I commend  the gentleman from  Virginia [Mr. DAVIS]  for getting it on  the consent calendar. I urge all of my  colleagues to pass it unanimously.  ",1997
353,House,105,0.56,634,18,Mrs. MYRICK.," Mr. Speaker, I yield 2  minutes  to  the  gentlewoman  from  Florida [Ms. Ros-LEHTINEN].  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker,  our colleagues, the gentlewoman from  south Florida, Mrs. CARRIE MEEK, and  the gentleman from Florida, Mr. ALCEE  HASTINGS, have done a  formidable  job  of defending our community, especially  the immigrant community, after their  many years of dedicated service.  All of us in the south Florida con gressional delegation have  the great  privilege of representing various pock ets of the immigrant community, and  we try to help all of those communities  whenever we can. I commend my col leagues, the gentlewoman from Florida  [Mrs. MEEK] and the gentleman from  Florida [Mr. HASTINGS], for their lead ership. It is because of their firm belief  in  fairness  that my other colleague,  the gentleman  from Miami, FL  [Mr.  DIAZ-BALART], and I are going to join  with them in working with our Florida  Senators,  CONNIE  MACK  and  BOB  GRAHAM,  to get fair treatment for the  Haitians.  In January when we come back to de bate  the new bills, we will continue  working with our south Florida col leagues and our Florida Senators to see  that the Guantanamo Haitians get the  fair treatment that they deserve.  I  visited  the Guantanamo base  in  Cuba while the Haitians were there, I  know of their plight. It was a great  honor for me when I first came to Con gress  to  represent  the community of  little Haiti. It is a wonderful law-abid ing community, and I have supported  and will continue to support the gen tlewoman from Florida [Mrs. MEEK] in  cosponsoring her bill. We have worked  with the White House to work out this  compromise that no deportations will  be  taking place while  the  legislation  moves  through  the proper procedures  in the House and the Senate.  D 2230  However, the bill before us now does  save many thousands of lives from the  immigration limbo that they are fac ing, the deportation that has been di viding many communities.  Therefore,  I urge my colleagues  to  support the rule and move this legisla tion forward, which is going to help so  many  immigrants. And we  look  for ward to continuing in the new session  in  supporting  other  immigrants  as  well.  As an immigrant myself, as a polit ical refugee who sought freedom and  democracy, I know what this country  stands for, and I know the beliefs that  have brought us here still linger in our  hearts. And we practice  them every  day. So I look forward to working with  my colleagues to see this come true.  ",1997
354,House,105,-0.656,634,18,Ms. WATERS.," Mr. Speaker, we find  ourselves in a rather unfortunate situ ation. This is the most cynical kind of  public policy-making that I have ever  witnessed. I cannot understand for the  life of me why the Haitians would have  been left out from consideration.  As  I  understand,  the  Immigration  and Naturalization  Service  reports  that, as of September 30, 1996, applica tions  for  asylum were  pending  for  about  Haitians,  Nica raguans,  Guatemalans,  and  191,000 Salvadorans.  How can they just drop the Haitians?  It does not make good sense, and then  they place  it on  the D.C. appropria tions, where we are desperate  to  try  and get a little justice for the District  of Columbia,  and  they  pit  people  against each other in the most unfair  way. There is no rational reason for it.  They should not put the gentlewoman  from Florida [Mrs. MEEK]  in the posi tion of standing up here asking for a no  vote on the rule for the District of Co lumbia, when they know how desperate  18,000  118,000  21,000  ",1997

379,,105,0.51,738,18,Mr. MANZULLO.," Mr. Speaker,  yesterday,  my family and  I had the opportunity to attend  the commemoration of Veterans Day held at  the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC. My  children, ages 9, 11, and 13, don't know the  meaning of the word ""Vietnam,"" though sev eral times we have talked  to them about the  Vietnam war.  Gen. Barry McCaffrey, Vietnam war veteran,  and now head of our Office of National Drug  Control Policy, gave a stirring speech about  the ones who  fought  the war,  reminding us  that the price of freedom  is very high.  I also  heard  the  incredible  speech  of  Ann  Cunningham, a nurse who served two tours of  duty in Vietnam and who shared her experi ences of the war.  Then I met a group of Vietnam veterans in  the rotunda of our Capitol, and  they advised  me that in many school history textbooks the  Vietnam war  is  relegated  to a simple para graph. The memory of  the 58,000-plus men  and women who perished in that war deserves  more than cursory comment.  Therefore,  I am  requesting  the  speeches  given  by Gen.  Barry Mccaffrey and Ann  Cunningham  be  included  in  the CONGRES SIONAL RECORD for today.  I trust that they will  be  read by children and serve as a missing  chapter in our history books.  REMARKS FOR VETERANS DAY, VIETNAM WAR  MEMORIAL  (By Gen. Barry Mccaffrey)  INTRODUCTION  Senator Hagel, Jan Scruggs, distinguished  guests, ladies, gentlemen, fellow Veterans of  the Vietnam War.  In particular the assembled soldiers of B  Company, 2-7th Cav who I was privileged to  serve with  in Vietnam during 1968-1969thank you for your courage and dedication  in combat and the joy of our reunion during  the past two days.  I am especially honored to be here with our  keynote  speaker,  the Honorable  Charles  Hagel, Senator from Nebraska, who coura geously served in Vietnam as a squad leader  in the 9th Infantry Division. He is one of the  seven U.S. Senators and nine Congressmen,  members of Congress, who fought in South east Asia.  Today we honor all  those who served  in  Vietnam-both  the  living  and  those who  never came home.  A ceremony at this site brings to mind the  images of the nearly three and a half million  men and thousands of women who served in  the Vietnam  theater.  It also  brings  into  sharp  focus  the  faces of mothers,  fathers,  young wives, and children who braved  the  uncertainty of  that conflict, waiting with  anticipation for the return of loved ones.  Our country did not treat any of you with  the respect, support, and compassion you de served. It was a shameful blot on our history  to send our country's young men and women  off to this terrible conflict and then use our  soldiers as objects of blame for the divisive  political  struggle  that  ripped  the  nation  apart for a decade.  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  The names inscribed on this monument are  those of men and women who went to Viet nam with their futures ahead of them and  who came back home only as memories to  their loved ones.  More than 58,000 died and over 303,000 were  wounded. The bloodshed was  terrible, and  the suffering has not ended. At least 80,000 of  our ranks still suffer from severe service connected disabilities; around 6 percent of  our Vietnam War comrades suffer from drug  abuse or dependence; 11 percent suffer from  current alcohol abuse; many are homeless;  and others still suffer from war-related psy chological and physical problems.  This continuing heavy human toll demands  that we Americans vigorously support  the  finest possible health care in our Veterans'  Administration facilities and sustain strong  outreach programs  to assist Veterans suf fering from drug and alcohol dependency and  physical and emotional wounds. Our nation  needs  to make  the sacrifice for  those who  sacrificed so much in Vietnam.  WHO WE WERE  Who were we, who went to war in Vietnam?  We were young. Our average age was 19. 60  percent of those killecl were 21 or younger. In  my unit, B Company 2-7 Cav, 1st Cavalry di vision, almost all of the troops were between  18 and 22-basically young men who rapidly  turned into hardened combat soldiers.  We  represented  the  face of America. We  were men and women, rich and poor. 11 per cent of our ranks were African-Americans. 5  percent were Hispanic.  We were the best educated troops our na tion had ever sent to war. 79 percent of us  had a high school education.  Most of us were volunteers. Many of our  best combat soldiers were drafted. More than  70 percent of our killed in action were volun teers. United by circumstance ancl choice, we  risked our lives for fellow soldiers and coun try.  We paid a high price  for  service  to our  country. A grunt in the 25th Infantry Divi sion had a 75 percent chance of being killed  or wounded. One  in four marines became a  combat casualty. We suffered amputations or  crippling wounds at 300 percent the rate of  our world War II forbears.  We served honorably. 97 percent of us re ceived honorable discharges.  We  have been  successful. Vietnam Vet erans enjoy  incomes higher  than our non veteran counterparts. We also have an em ployment  rate  113  higher  than  those who  never served in the armed forces.  WHAT WE LEARNED  The Vietnam War officially ended in 1975,  more than twenty-two years ago. For many  of us, nearly three decades have passed since  our  time  in Vietnam. The historians may  still be sifting through mountains of docu ments. However, most of us assembled here  already know what we learned from the War.  1st-We must not commit our youth to war  without the support of the American people.  For  in a democracy,  lack of such support  produces catastrophic divisiveness and weak ening of national will, which are essential to  winning.  2nd-We must not send our sons and daugh ters to war without a clear understanding of  national aims and  the costs for achieving  them. For failing to articulate these require ments leads to flawed strategies and higher  casualties.  3rd-Victory will be paid for  in blood by  the men and women who serve and by loved  ones at home who must bear separations, re coveries  from wounds,  and ultimate  sac rifices.  November 12, 1997  And 4th-As individuals, we learned that to  survive and succeed when conditions are ap palling and your life is on the line requires:  moral  and  physical  courage,  competence,  self-discipline, and trust in your buddies.  THE FUTURE  Our nation needs your help:  1st, Help Vietnam Veterans in need. Get  involved in state, local, and Veteran organi zations. offer your energy, time, money, and  support.  2nd, Battle the evil of illegal drugs. Get in volved in state, local, and community anti drug efforts.  3rd,  Improve  your  community. Get  in volved in other activities to make your com munity better. Our nation's leadership sys tem works from the bottom up.  ENDING  We  stand before  this black marble wall  with row after row of names and salute fall en comrades for their courage. We remember  the worlds of poet Laurence Binyon, who  wrote at the end of World War I:  ""They shall not grow old, as we that are left  grow old,  Age shall not weary them, nor the years con demn,  the going down of the sun and  morning  We will remember them.""  Thank you Vietnam Veterans  service to America.  your  for  At  in  the  SPEECH OF ANN CUNNINGHAM  Today is Veterans Day-a day set aside to  honor the men and women who have served  this country.  Today is also the 15th anniversary of the  dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memo rial-the Wall-which at the time of dedica tion was scorned and  ridiculed as a black  gash of shame and today is the most visited  of any Memorial in Washington.  Today is also the 4th anniversary of the  dedication of the Vietnam Women's Memo rial-which took 10 years to build and I feel  would never have been built but for the te nacity and determination of Diane Carlson  Evans. People ask me which of  the  three  women remind me of myself. They all re mind me of myself at one time or another,  but the one I am most drawn to is the kneel ing figure. If you look closely at her face you  will see pain, sadness, exhaustion, and com passion reflected there. All the women who  served in Vietnam and during the Vietnam  War had these traitsfrom the nurse in the  operating room, to the nurse in the ICU unit.  From the Red Cross women who read books  and wrote letters for wounded GI's, to  the  Air Traffic Controllers who  brought  the  planes home after their missions, from  the  women who counted and tallied up the cas ualties daily, to the women in Special Serv ices.  Thirty years ago I was in Vietnam. I was a  young, naive 22 year old, a year and a half  out of nursing school when I joined the Army  Nurse Corps. I was two and a half weeks out  of basic  training the day I  landed at Bien  Hoa Airbase with about half of my basic  class and a greener 2nd Lt. you would never  find.  I was a trained operating room nurse, but  I had never seen a trauma patient, let alone  a mass casualty situation. Needless to say in  the next 12 months I saw many such situa tions. It was the best of times and the worst  of times and  it took me 15 years  to  talk  about  it. When  the Wall was dedicated,  I  didn't even know about it because I didn't  read about Vietnam or watch Vietnam mov ies.  ",1997
380,Senate,105,-0.293,946,18,Mr. HOLLINGS.," Mr.  President,  I  want  to  thank Congressman UNDER WOOD of Guam for pursuing H.R. 2476.  The bill, virtually identical to a bill re ported by the Commerce Committee, S.  1196, puts the same burden on foreign  air carriers serving the United States  as those now imposed on U.S. carriers  when dealing with the families affected  by aviation disasters. Under existing  law, U.S.  carriers must develop and  submit plans  to  the Department of  Transportation  and  the  National  Transportation Safety Board on how  they will address the needs of the fami lies of victims of disasters. The  law  today does not include foreign air car riers, and thus, H.R. 2476 is needed.  The bill is supported by the Adminis tration,  and  I  support  its adoption.  What we are asking all of the carriers  to do  is treat people fairly. The U.S.  carriers have already been asked to do  it, and now we are asking the foreign  air carriers to do it. All carriers, for eign or U.S., should be prepared to deal  with the families and to provide them  with the kinds of assistance they have  every reason  to expect. H.R. 2476 en sures that this will happen. I urge the  Senate to pass this bill.  ",1997
381,House,105,-0.333,959,18,Mr. BALDACCI.," Mr. Speaker, while  we have had many accomplishments on  health care, on education, on  small  business and individual tax credits, we  still have one of our accomplishments  yet to come and that is with campaign  finance reform.  In the last Congress we had 32 Mem bers who signed a discharge petition  that would have forced the issue to be  addressed on the House floor.  In this  Congress,  we  are making  progress.  There  are  187 Members  that  have  signed this discharge petition. This is  very important if we are going to re gain the trust of the American people  in their political process. It has to be  done  for  the public  interest and not  special private interest.  Also,  in Maine we began the Maine  Code of Ethics. The code of ethics was  ",1997
382,,105,-0.346,972,18,Mrs. KENNELLY of Connecticut.," Mr.  Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  Mr. Speaker, first let me thank the  gentleman  from  Florida, Mr.  CLAY  SHAW, the subcommittee chair with ju risdiction over this bill, for his incred ible support, his patience, and his will ingness  to work  alongside  the  gen tleman from Michigan, Mr. CAMP, and  myself  to make  sure  that  this day  came about.  I  really appreciate what  he has done. His  leadership has been  outstanding. I thank him very much.  I also want to say on the floor today  what a delight it has been to work with  the  gentleman  from Michigan, Mr.  DAVE CAMP. He truly intimately, per sonally understood what this bill was  about. He personally cared about the  children of America.  The past week or so as we were hav ing the struggle  to see  if the Senate  would in fact take up this bill, he daily  went  to  see his Senate  friends,  and  sometimes I wondered if they were his  friends, but those that were working on  this bill,  trying to tell them how im portant it was that we pass this bill be fore this session ended.  The  reason  for  that, Mr. Speaker,  was this past April the House took the  important step toward protecting chil dren and promoting adoption. Today  we can finish that job by sending to the  President this bill, an amended version  of the same legislation that we passed  in April.  As I said to the Senators on the fi nance committee a little over a month  ago,  I  could not understand how we  could go home  to our loving families  for the holidays, for Thanksgiving and  Christmas, and not act upon this bill,  because  this bill  is about children of  America who do not have safe, loving,  and permanent homes. If we did not act  upon this bill they would not have the  hope of safe, loving, permanent homes.  This legislation we can all agree on is  putting children on a fast track from  foster care to safe and loving and per manent homes. This is what this is all  about.  Before  I  continue  I  also want  to  thank  the gentleman  from Michigan  [Mr. LEVIN],  the ranking member, the  democratic ranking member of the sub committee, for being so supportive of  this legislation. Also, one of the rea sons we have reached this point is that  our First Lady, Mrs. Hillary Clinton,  was incredibly supportive of this effort,  to the point that she went one on one  on one to the various members of the  Senate who really wanted this legisla tion, wanted it as badly, I think, as we  did, but they wanted a perfect piece of  legislation.  What the gentleman from Michigan,  Mr. DA vm CAMP and I realized is that  at this point in time we could not do a  perfect piece of legislation, but what  we could do was a very good piece of  legislation. Mrs. Clinton  understood  ",1997
383,House,105,-0.367,985,18,Ms. SANCHEZ.," Madam Speaker,  I rise  to  commend my colleagues  in  the House  for  passing H.R. 1753, establishing not less than  2,500 Boys and Girls Clubs of America facili ties by 2000.  I was pleased  to support this  measure.  I wish  to direct particular attention  to  the  work of  the Girls and Boys Club of Garden  Grove, CA. Since 1956,  the Garden Grove  clubs have strived to improve our community  with programs that meet families' needs.  The Girls and Boys Club of Garden Grove  have 9 centers that serve 1,000 children every  day, providing what  these children need: a  safe, enriching alternative  to  the streets, en couragement to succeed  in school, and pro viding family support.  Each of  the nine  ""Kids Clubs"" offer daily  programs that are unique in order to address  the specific needs of the children and families  living  in  specific neighborhoods.  In Orange  County, 70 percent of children come home to  an empty house after school. Children who  are home alone after school are twice as likely  as other children  to abuse alcohol,  tobacco,  and drugs.  As  long as a child is actively involved in a  Girls and Boys Club, they are not just staying  off the streets, they are staying out of trouble.  They are learning in computer labs and home work assistance programs; they are being for tified  in cooking and nutrition programs,  they  are growing strong and confident in the gym  and on the play yards, they are being enriched  in craft classes and shops, and they are build ing character in leadership programs.  The Garden Grove Clubs  are  currently  seeking  to establish  five new  ""Kids Clubs""  Centers at  schools  throughout my district.  There are over 10,000 children needing a safe  place to go after school. As of now, Garden  Grove only has the sites to serve about 2,000  kids. I strongly support H.R. 1753 and encour age the National Boys and Girls Club to dis tribute funds and assistance to the successful  Girls and Boys Club in Garden Grove so they  can continue to enrich the  lives of thousands  of other young Americans.

Mr. Speaker,  I,  too,  thank  the gentleman from California  for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I want to point out this  is really an extremely important effort  on behalf of our Army and National  Guard participating"" soldiers. The gen tlewoman  from North Carolina  [Mrs.  CLAYTON]  has  stepped  forward  today  with a piece of legislation that will be  very important to 4,206 Army Reserve  and National Guard soldiers who, un fortunately, because of an administra tive error, were not given the proper  reimbursement on the shipment of per sonal goods.  This really goes beyond the shipment  of personal items. The Representative  from North Carolina  [Mrs. CLAYTON]  recognizes when these troops deploy to  and from an overseas mission, they de serve to get a level of equity which, un fortunately, was not provided in this  case.  There are no second-class soldiers in  the United States Army. This corrects  that inequity. It is, in fact,  the Army  Reserve-National Guard Equity Reim bursement Act, and I strongly urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support the legislation.  ",1997
385,House,105,-0.045,1024,18,Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi.," Mr.  Speaker, I would like to join the long  list of people commending the gentle woman  from North Carolina  [Mrs.  OLA YTON]  for bringing this to our at tention.  Over 4,200 reservists will be affected  in their pocketbooks by this. They do  not make much money. Most of them  volunteered to go  to Bosnia. Some of  them were involuntarily called up. All  of them  took a pay cut,  in all prob ability, to serve their country. So it is  very important that, where we can and  when we can, we see  to it that they  [Mr.  incur no unnecessary expense in doing  so.  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the  gentlewoman  from  North  Carolina  [Mrs. OLA YTON] for bringing this to our  attention. I want to commend the gen tleman from Indiana [Mr. BUYER] and  the  gentleman  from Virginia  BATEMAN] for allowing this to come to  the floor today. We are definitely doing  the best thing for those people in uni form.  ",1997
386,House,105,0.435,1024,18,Mr. BUYER.," Mr. Speaker,  I  thank  the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Military Readiness for yielding me this  time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of the legislation to correct these er rors with regard to our troops. This is  really basically, my colleagues,  sup port-the-troops legislation.  This  legislation corrects a problem  created earlier this year when, due to  an administrative change in Army pol icy, reservists deployed to Bosnia were  forced to pay out of their own pocket  to ship their personal goods home at  the completion of their tour. Most of  the reservists called for the second ro.:.  tation to Bosnia were affected by this  change.  This matter came to the attention of  the authorizing Committee on National  Security really  too  late to deal with  this issue effectively in the defense bill  this year.  I compliment the gentlewoman from  North Carolina  [Mrs.  CLAYTON]  for  bringing this to everyone's attention. I  am  disappointed  that  the Assistant  Secretary of the Army for Manpower  and Reserve affairs, Ms. Sara Lister,  would not have brought  this  imme diately to the Committee on National  Security's  attention.  I  know  she  brought  this  in  response  to your  in quiry, but I wish she had brought it  right  to  the authorizing committee.  Perhaps, if she is listening, she is going  to get that warning order.  I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation. The  troops can be  reimbursed  in a  timely  fashion  for  their  selfless  service  to  their  country.  I  agree with  the ranking member that  hopefully the Senate will take this up  immediately.  ",1997
387,House,105,0.411,1037,18,Mr. CUNNINGHAM.," Mr.  Speaker,  there are not two more Members I re spect more  than  the gentleman from  Missouri  [Mr. SKELTON] and  the gen tleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. MUR THA].  I have not heard the tape. I will lis ten to it tonight, if I can. If that is the  case,  then, yes, she should have her  day. But the problem is the day will be  2 or 3 months from now, when all this  issue is dead.  Joe  Paterno,  one  of my  favorite  coaches at Penn State,  told a  story  when I was in a football clinic. He said  his dad was in the Army and hated the  Marine Corps. He  said  they were  a  bunch of peacocks.  You  can  imagine  Joe  Paterno's  amazement and  the  father's  amaze ment and this old Italian family when  his oldest brother came up and said he  was going  to  join  the Marine Corps.  The father in his old way said, ""Go off,  my son, and become a peacock."" And  he did. This is a son that never spoke  back to his father a day in his life in  that old Italian family.  The day he  came back after boot  camp  in his  finery,  his  father  said,  ""Look, here  is that peacock."" And a  man that had never spoken an ill word  to his Italian father in his life put his  finger in his chest and says, ""Don't you  ever say anything bad about the United  States Marine Corps. It can lick any 10  Army regiments."" The gentleman from  California [Mr. HUNTER] would disagree  with that.  But his whole idea was how do you  collectively take a mind and mold it  into a  fighting machine with respect,  and he took that same esprit de corps  and turned it into the Penn State foot ball  team. And he  talks about  tradi tion.  What this gentlelady has just done is  violate that tradition, and we cannot  accept that kind of character, or lack  of character, in the leadership of the  Department of Defense. We can neither  accept nor tolerate it. And, in my opin ion,  if the allegations are  true,  this  gentlelady has no place, because  the  position of leadership in the military is  not just a position, it is a guidepost for  men and women in all the services.

408,,105,-0.265,1154,18,Mr. BOUCHER.," Mr. Speaker,  I rise  today  with my distinguished colleague the gentleman  from California, Mr. CAMPBELL, to introduce the  Digital Era Copyright Enhancement Act. We  believe this legislation best advances the inter ests of both creators and users of copyrighted  works  in  the digital era by modernizing  the  Copyright Act in a way that will preserve  the  fundamental balance built into the act by our  predecessors throughout the analog era.  We offer  this measure as an appropriate  starting point tor congressional discussion of a  range of copyright changes which  the advent  of digital  technology will  require  in  the belief  that the legislation will serve as a solid foun dation  tor  the debate on  these matters next  year. We look forward to participating with the  administration, other Members of Congress  and  interested external parties as next year's  discussions commence.  At the request of the administration, legisla tion was introduced earlier this year to imple ment two treaties negotiated by more than 1 00  nations under the auspices of the World Intel lectual  Property Organization  [WIPO].  The  matters raised by introduction of the adminis tration's WIPO  implementing  legislation cer tainly are  important, but these  issues should  not be addressed in isolation.  I believe that we should address other com pelling matters as part of a comprehensive  November 13, 1997  measure revising the Copyright Act for the dig ital era. Moreover, I have serious concerns re garding the approach taken in the administra tion's  legislation  in addressing so-called cir cumvention devices.  As more  fully explained  in  the section-by-  section analysis that accompanies this state ment, our comprehensive legislation address es matters of concern not only  to copyright  proprietors, but also to consumers, educators,  librarians,  archivists,  device manufacturers,  and other groups concerned about maintaining  a proper balance in the Copyright Act. For the  benefit of my colleagues, I thought it would be  helpful to describe the provisions of our legis lation, focusing in particular on proposed sec tion 1201.  Section 1201. Because  I have serious res ervations  about  the  implications  for  digital  technologies of the administration's device-ori ented approach to section 1201, I have crafted  an alternative that is more properly and close ly tailored to our WIPO treaty obligations.  Last December, when the U.S. Government  and  the  representatives of more  than  100  other governments met in Geneva to negotiate  the text of the two WIPO treaties, they initially  considered a draft text prepared by the chair man of the drafting committee, Mr. Liedes of  Finland. That provision would have essentially  outlawed the manufacturing of any device the  primary purpose or effect of which is to avoid  any anticopying technology. Perhaps not sur prisingly, opposition to this device-oriented ap proach was expressed by numerous countries  based upon a concern  that such a provision  could sweep within  its  reach  legitimate and  useful technology and inhibit the willingness of  manufacturers to bring new products to mar ket. As a result of that strong opposition, the  device oriented  this approach was dropped.  Instead, the delegates adopted an alternative  formulation  that closely  followed  language  I  had proposed to the administration prior to the  diplomatic conference.  And yet, the device-oriented approach hav ing been rejected by the delegates in Geneva,  the administration nonetheless has proposed  as the core of its legislation implementing the  WIPO treaties a device-oriented provision.  During the hearings held this fall before the  Judiciary Committee's Courts and  Intellectual  Property Subcommittee,  the Commissioner of  .Patents and Trademarks confirmed what many  private-sector witnesses argued  in  their testi mony, namely that the adoption of legislation  that essentially would punish the manufactur ers of devices, such as general purpose com puters and recorders, is not necessary for the  implementation of the WI PO treaties. Commis sioner Lehman correctly stated that the United  States could  take an entirely different and  I  think more positive approach by adopting leg islation that does not punish the manufacturer  of devices but instead punishes circumvention  conduct tied to the act of infringement.  The  subcommittee also heard compelling  testimony that the approach of the administra tion's bill would stifle the  introduction of new  technology and would effectively overturn the  long-settled  law of  the United States as an nounced by the Supreme Court in 1984 in  its  Betamax  decision, Sony Corp.  of America  versus Universal City Studios,  Inc.  In  that  case, the Court held that a manufacturer could  ",1997
409,,105,-0.325,1167,18,Ms. STABENOW.," Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to pay  tribute  to a woman who exemplifies  public service in every sense of the word-Vir ginia White.  After serving for 25 years as clerk of Merid ian Township, Virginia has decided  to step  down from office, leaving a legacy of trust, re sponsibility, and dedication.  As clerk, her  responsibilities  for Meridian  Township included director of elections, keepEXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  er of records, and voting member on the town ship's policy board. But Virginia was much  more. Virginia gained admiration by always  doing what was best for her community-she  was, and will always be, an outstanding public  servant.  During her 25 years in office,  it wasn't just  what Virginia did, but how she did it. Each re sponsibility she held was completed with con viction, pride, and the deepest sense of integ rity.  One of her  largest contributions has been  her work in bringing more people into the polit ical process. As president of the Michigan As sociation of Clerks, Virginia worked hard  to  modernize elections for the public and wrote a  book on how to improve voting in the State of  Michigan. In November 1995, Virginia was ap pointed  to  the Secretary of State's Election  Advisory Committee, where she made a series  of recommendations  to curb duplicate voting  and make voting rules more clear for voters.  I have enjoyed working with Virginia on  many occasions during  the past 20 years. I  particularly appreciated our joint efforts to or ganize a celebration  for  the Meridian Town ship Sesquicentennial.  Virginia will always be a leader, not only in  Meridian Township, but throughout Michigan. I  thank her for her service and  I wish her the  very best in the future.  THE THOMAS M. FOGLIETTA  SUPPORT SITE  HON. JAME'S A. TRAFICANT, JR.  OF OHIO  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 13, 1997  ",1997
410,,105,-0.082,1167,18,Mr. TRAFICANT.," Mr. Speaker, on Novem ber 8, 1997, I introduced H.R. 2931, legislation  to  redesignate  the naval  facility  located  in  Gricignano d'Aversa, Italy, currently known as  the Naples Support Site as the ""Thomas M.  Foglietta Support Site."" I respectfully urge my  colleagues to support this bill, which will pay  tribute  to a  fine Member, who was  recently  sworn in as Ambassador to Italy.  Born and  raised  in Philadelphia, PA, Am bassador FOGLIETTA  has a  long history of  service  to his hometown, his State, and his  country. He practiced  law for 27 years. First  elected  to  the Philadelphia City Council  in  1955, he was the youngest council member of  a major U.S. city. He held  this position until  1975. From 1976 to 1977 Ambassador FoGu ETTA was the representative of the U.S. Sec retary of Labor in Pennsylvania under Presi dent Gerald Ford. In 1980 he was first elected  to  represent Pennsylvania's First Congres sional District and has since won  the over whelming loyalty of his constituents.  As  a Member of Congress, Ambassador  FOGLIETTA sought to protect the industrial base  of his constituents. He  fought  tenaciously  to  keep open the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, a  facility that once formed  the backbone of in dustry in the area. Unfortunately, as the facility  was deemed  to have become obsolete, an  independent commission set up by Congress  recommended that the base be closed. How ever, Ambassador FOGUETTA would not let the  matter rest.  In an effort to make the best of  26657  the situation, TOM  fought  to secure Federal  funding for defense conversion. He wanted to  ensure  that his hometown would be able  to  shift  its  industrial base, and  to preserve  its  economic vitality.  Now, our friend and colleague is taking his  career  in another direction. Last month, he  was confirmed by  the Senate as  the next  United States Ambassador to  Italy. However,  foreign affairs is not a new interest for Ambas sador FOGLIETTA. During  the 1980's Ambas sador FOGLIETTA was one of the leading advo cates of democratic reforms  in South Korea.  He has also participated in efforts to  restore  the democratically elected regime of Haiti.  In  Congress his committee assignments involved  work related to international relations and na tional security. He was appointed  to  the Ap propriations Committee  in  1993  and  has  served on its Subcommittee on Foreign Oper ations. As a member of this subcommittee he  has served as a leading advocate for U.S. as sistance to promote free markets and demo cratic reforms in the newly independent states  of the former Soviet Union.  More than 1 O years ago Ambassador FoGu ETT A  visited  the  Navy's  facilities  around  Naples and was disturbed by  the conditions  he saw  there. Following  this visit he worked  with the Navy and Congress to build new fa cilities  for U.S.  forces. H.R. 2931  is a fitting  tribute to our former colleague,  in  light of his  efforts on behalf of our troops and his new po sition as U.S. Ambassador to Italy.  I would like to wish the best as he assumes  his new responsibilities. I hope my colleagues  will join me in honoring the work that he has  done for the city of Philadelphia, here in Con gress and the work that he will continue to do  on behalf of our country as Ambassador  to  Italy.  I urge all of my colleagues  to support  H.R. 2931,  to  redesignated  the naval  facility  located in Gricignano d'Aversa, Italy, currently  known as  the Naples Support Site, as  the  ""Thomas M. Foglietta Support Site.""  TRIBUTE TO THE PEREZ COUNCIL  #262, KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS  HON. Bill PASCREll, JR.  OF NEW JERSEY  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 13, 1997  ",1997
411,,105,0.109,1180,18,Mr. FORBES.," Mr. Speaker,  it is with great  pleasure  that  I rise  today  to pay  tribute  the  Unitarian  Universalist  Fellowship  at  Stony  Brook, Long  Island on their 35th anniversary.  The name  ""Unitarian"" was coined  in  the  16th century for Protestant dissenters who re jected  the doctrine of the  trinity.  In practice,  the term is used to identify those who believed  in a loving god who would not condemn any  of his creation, but rather would save all. The  Unitarian Fellowship strives to create a com passionate community founded on trust, love,  forgiveness and acceptance, where people of  all backgrounds and persuasions can come to gether for worship.  Members of the Unitarian Universalist Fel lowship of Stony Brook have a variety of reli gious experiences and each offers their own  intellectual, theological and spiritual stimulation  to the group. Though the members are diverse  in their background and experiences, they are  uniform  in  their dedication and  loyalty to the  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  November 13, 1997  Lord. They are committed to achieving a world  community with peace, liberty, and justice for  all, and they believe that by encouraging spir itual growth and maintaining  respect  for one  another this can be achieved.  I believe  that an organization  that honors  human dignity, nurtures  individual potential,  and works for social  justice and the common  good deserves  recognition. That  is why, Mr.  Speaker, I rise  today in  this hallowed Cham ber and ask my colleagues  for  joining me  today in celebration of this special anniversary  for  the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of  Stony Brook.

412,,105,0.392,1180,18,Mr. BILBRAY.," Mr. Speaker,  it is with great  pride and admiration that I rise to commend a  group of small business owners in the down town Village of La Jolla who have contributed  thousands of hours to improve the economic  vitality of this area.  Starting with a small group of local business  owners  in  1987,  this  business  association  named  their group  ""Promote La Jolla,  Inc.""  The name identified their goal of developing,  maintaining  and  promoting  a healthy  local  business  community.  Capitalizing  on  the  charming, picturesque nature of this 100-year old seaside Village,  they  identified the visitor  industry as a key element to  long  term eco nomic strength and vitality. They worked with  local tourism organization and developed spe cial hosted day long events to  this  lively Vil lage by the sea along with a promotional pro gram  to build positive awareness of La Jolla  as a very desirable visitor destination.  Over this  ten year period,  this small group  of business owners recognized that achieving  economic vitality  in a downtown area would  require a much more complex strategic plan  and a broader membership base. In 1992, this  group of pioneering business owners  joined  with  the City of San Diego  to  form  the  ""La  Jolla Business Improvement District.""  Now,  representing over 1,400 businesses  covering a 30 block area,  the La Jolla Busi ness Improvement District is the largest in the  State of California and one of the  largest in  the United States.  Combining  the  entrepreneurial  energy of  small business owners along with the  leader ship of this group of 15 dedicated Board mem bers, the Promote La Jolla Business Improve ment District has developed a comprehensive  strategy of Promotions and Marketing, Beau tification and Design, Economic Development  and Restructuring.  This approach to improving economic vitality  of the seaside Village of La Jolla has made  Promote La Jolla Business  Improvement Dis trict one of the leading business organizations  in the City of San Diego.  The  founding members of the board: Alex ander Bende, Gerhard Klein, Robert Carlyle,  David Brands and Friedhelm Worunann set  the  foundation  for  the  latest group of board  members who continue to donate hundreds of  hours each year to improving the economic vi tality of the historic 100-year-old downtown Vil lage of La Jolla. This year, Mrs. Bende and  Mrs. Klein celebrate  ten years of dedicated  service  and  executive  director Christopher  Stokes celebrates his fifth year.  I extend my best wishes to Bill Price, Alex ander Bende, Candice Stephens, Joyce Snell,  Jeff  Stone, Gerhard  Klein,  Joost  Bende,  Gerhard Bendl, John Wolfe, Steve Riddle,  Patti Keyes, Beth Dunn, Ron Searfoss, and  Mike McGeath, the current Board of Directors  who have shown  the continued dedication to  make the Village of La Jolla, the ""Jewel of the  California Coast""  for now and many years to  come.

But New Jersey State  Senator John Ewing of Bernardsville is indeed  worthy of special recognition.  Jack Ewing has been an  institution  in  the  New Jersey Legislature-a  tireless crusader  for all the people of ou( State. For three dec ades he has waged a  long, at times,  lonely  battle  to  improve  the quality of public edu cation and to make New Jersey's colleges na tionally acclaimed institutions of excellence.  But just as important, Jack will be remem bered for his extraordinary commitment to help  people in need. Jack Ewing is the kind of man  who, after a long day and night session at the  state house, would stop to change a tire for a  motorist in need. The next day, he would be  up early, back in his office calling everyone he  knew to help find a job for a father of young  children who was down on his luck.  Next month, Drew University in Madison, NJ  will establish  the John E. Ewing Center  for  Public Service and Public Affairs. It is a fitting  tribute to a man who represents the finest in  public service and the best of New Jersey.  On behalf of all the people of New Jersey,  I want  to extend a heartfelt  thanks  to Jack  Ewing  for his exceptional  leadership, dedica tion, and service. We extend our sincere best  EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS  wishes for a long, healthy and fulfilling retirement.  RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN AIR  SHOWS ACT  HON.

414,,105,-0.263,1193,18,Mr. KIND.," Mr. Speaker, one more day and  no campaign finance reform. At a press con ference today, the members of the Republican  leadership said  that  they will  take up cam paign  finance  reform early next year. The  leadership also said  that  they will consider  several small bills,  rather than a comprehen sive piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker that ap proach is inadequate.  As  I have explained before, next year  is  going to be too late to consider campaign fi nance reform in time for the 1998 election. In  addition, allowing a variety of small  incre mental bills will only result in more confusion  and more  loopholes  for special  interests  to  buy our elections. It is obvious that the leader ship has no desire  to see  real campaign  fi nance reform pass this year.  What we need is comprehensive campaign  finance reform. We need reform that takes the  big money out of campaigns. We don't need  incremental bills that only add confusion to an  already confusing system. The House of Rep resentatives has to act soon.  Mr. Speaker, it appears that we have failed  the people of  this Nation by not passing a  campaign  reform vote  this year,  lets not let  them down again next year.  ",1997
